James Callaghan

The reorganisation now of society on classless lines by the proletariat will release immense energies in an uninhibited environment. It is a miserable, cringing mentality, confined to the 'higher standard of living of our people', striving to hold on to what it has and to keep people where they are, which does not understand that the only way out is to give people new visions of themselves, so that they will find new ways to express them and to create new ties, new bonds and a new understanding between those who are now so divided.

## Preface

This book is an attempt to put in historical perspective the Black presence in  Britain  as  it  relates  to  the  development  of  British  capitalism  and  its control and exploitation of black labour. The making of the black working class  in  twentieth-century  Britain  has  been  a  long  process,  reflecting essential  changes  in  Britain's  labour  needs  over  time,  both  at  home  and abroad.

As overseas trade expanded, the discipline and control of labour (both black and white) became imperative to Britain's economic well-being. To ensure the continued exploitation of colonial labour, an ideology based on racial differences, which bred an inferior/superior nexus both in interpersonal  relations  and  in  international  trade,  was  constructed  to  keep Blacks in subjection.

Thus,  plantocracy  racism  supported  by  British  capitalists,  politicians, historians  and  influential  people  of  letters,  engendered  dogmatic  belief  in white  supremacy  and  institutionalised  racism  in  Britain  and  her  colonial 'possessions'.  Consequently,  the  cultural  transmission  of  racist  ideas  was handed  down  over  generations.  Historically,  as  Blacks  in  the  colonies laboured under the inhuman and deplorable working conditions endemic in slavery,  indentureship  and  trade  union-regulated  working  conditions,  in response, they resorted either 'spontaneously' or in an 'organised' way to

various forms of resistance, creating in the process, their own ideologies of Indian  nationalism,  Pan  Africanism  and  Black  Power,  and  autonomous organisation. This tradition of struggle has, in turn, informed and strengthened the black working-class movements both in the colonies and Britain in recent years.

In order to avoid any confusion that might arise in the reader's mind, it is  perhaps  necessary  to  define  the  'black  working  class'  in  the  context  of this book. In general, 'black' refers to non-white persons, particularly those from  former  colonial  and  Commonwealth  countries.  Within  this  usage, there  are  sub-divisions  denoting  the  various  constituent  groups:  these  are Africans, Asians,  West  Indians, Afro-Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, AsianCaribbeans  and  Black  British.  'Working  class'  refers  essentially  to  those unskilled  and  semi-skilled  Blacks  who  came  to  Britain  throughout  the period, but particularly during the heavy post-war immigration in search of jobs.

The  task  of  writing  this  book  has  been  made  less  onerous  by  the encouragement  of  many  people,  particularly  Tim  O'Keeffe  and  Louise Floyd; Ziggi Alexander, Jane Anthony, Crispin Cross, Ghazala Faizi, Moira Ferguson, Peter Fraser, Peter Fryer, David Hill, Peter Hogg, David Paisey, Lina  Patel,  Brian  Rooney, Allen  Synge  and  Rosina  Visram.  I  would  also like  to  thank  many  of  my  colleagues  and  members  of  staff  in  the  British Library  (at  the  Reference  Division,  Bloomsbury,  the  Newspaper  Library, Colindale  and  the  India  Office  Library);  the  staffs  at  the  Public  Records Office  Library  (Chancery  Lane  and  Kew);  the  Library  of  Economics  and Political  Science;  the  Institute  of  Commonwealth  Studies  Library;  the Labour Party Library, and A.

## Introduction to the Second Edition

On 16 April 2016, a special event was held at Congress House in Central London to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the completed manuscript of The  Making  of  the  Black  Working  Class  in  Britain .  The  occasion  was filmed  and  a  clip  titled  'An Audience  with  Ron  Ramdin'  was  put  online. Prior to the event, I was approached by Verso Books about republishing the book. For both the book and myself to be so honoured made me pause for reflection.

On  its  first  publication  in  1987,  a  book  reviewer  in New  Society described  it as a 'pioneering  and  valuable  work  of  scholarship  and interpretation'. I was struck by 'valuable work of scholarship and interpretation'. Why?  Because  hitherto  I'd not read such a positive reference to any book on the history of Black people in Britain, especially one  featuring  Black  workers.  Even  more  encouraging  educationally,  the book was widely read and used by researchers, students, and writers. As one author  put  it,  he  had  'cannibalised'  the  book  for  his  own  work. As  time passed, in-depth academic book reviews appeared in the British Journal of Sociology ,  the American  Journal  of  Sociology and History  Today among others;  and  the Times newspaper  included  it  in  its  'Pick  of  Paperbacks'. Given that hitherto British historians had largely ignored the long-standing existence of Black and Asian people in Britain, from the outset, I'd intended

that The Making should take a long view of this hidden presence, certainly long enough to show continuity. In the context of an expansive history, this 'presence' and contribution, I felt, would make more sense than it would in any  short, largely general  account  and,  at the same  time,  correct  a widespread  misunderstanding  that  Black  people  began  coming  to  Britain only in the 1950s. Thus, given that there had been Black people in Britain since Roman times, I structured the book in three parts to cover the period from 1555 to 1986; a perspective which I thought was preferential if one was to better understand not only the pre-twentieth-century Black presence, but  also  the  interwar  period  and  the  turbulent  forty  years  prior  to  1986. Overall, such a long view of Black people in Britain would, I felt, not only incorporate their multifaceted contribution both in war and peacetime, but also  place The Making as  an  integral  study  relating  to  a  deeply  ingrained attitude and therefore to all aspects of British society.

After  I'd  published From  Chattel  Slave  to  Wage  Earner ,  a  work  on labour history in the Caribbean, I was surprised that there was no book on Black workers in Britain. Thereafter,  I  became  increasingly  fascinated  by the pre- and early-twentieth-century contribution of Black and Asian people to the British economy. As I stated in the preface to The Making ,

To ensure the continued exploitation of colonial labour, an ideology based on racial differences,  which  bred  an  inferior/superior  nexus, both  in interpersonal relations and  in international trade, was constructed to keep Blacks in subjection … Historically, as Blacks in the colonies laboured under the inhuman and deplorable working conditions endemic  in  slavery, indentureship and  trade unionregulated  working  conditions,  in  response,  they  resorted  either 'spontaneously'  or  in  an  'organised'  way  to  various  forms  of resistance,  creating  in  the  process,  their  own  ideologies  of  Indian Nationalism,  Pan  Africanism  and  Black  Power,  and  autonomous organisation.  This  tradition  of  struggle  has,  in  turn,  informed  and strengthened  Black  working-class  movements  both  in  the  colonies and Britain in recent years.

As  these  ideas  and  struggles  evolved,  I  continued  to  question  aspects  of social orthodoxy - namely race, tribe, caste, colour, class, gender, culture, religion  and  so  on  -  categorisations  reflecting  aspects  of  divisive  social

behaviour that were more often than not to be found in various academic journals and books. Indeed in relation to one of these forms of totalisation class - I was surprised to find that after years of research contrary to my understanding,  one  famous  textbook, The Making of the English Working Class , had  entirely  overlooked  the  presence  and  contribution  of  Black leaders who were prominent in English working-class struggles.

For the purposes of The Making of the Black Working Class in Britain , my definitions of 'Black' and 'working class' were clear. Thirty years on, those descriptions are still relevant and often used today by trade unionists, socialists, politicians and social commentators. In recent years, however, the influx of migrants (including those seeking asylum and refugees) from all over the world has added to an even more diverse working population; an extraordinary commingling of people speaking a large number of languages, especially in London and the larger British cities.

Soon after I'd completed the manuscript there was no doubt in my mind that The Making (for  so  long  a  hidden  story)  was  an  essential  and  timely text which not only broadens and gives depth to our understanding of the past, but also foregrounds an evolving multicultural Britain. It was also very rare that a book of this kind should become a bestseller and quickly go out of  print  at  a  time  when  academics  were  still  largely  disinterested  in  the growing  populations  of  Black  and  ethnic  minorities  as  integral  to  British history.  But  while The  Making has  been  informative  for  students  and general readers, for a new generation of those born and bred in Britain, as well as new immigrants from outside the Commonwealth, a great deal was (and  is)  taken  for  granted!  Some  fundamental  'rights'  (for  example,  the Race Relations Act, affecting people at the workplace and in communities) enjoyed  by  today's  citizens  were  not  achieved  overnight.  In  fact,  such 'rights' became law as a direct result of insistent, bitter campaigns against racism and sexism waged by Black and Asian workers in the 1960s, 1970s and  1980s.  But  while  there  has  been  change,  racism  and  sexism  have persisted.

This  year  marks  the  fortieth  anniversary  of  the  Grunwick  strike.  The 'Grunwick  40'  exhibition  currently  on  display  in  the  Brent  Museum  and Archives  at  the  Willesden  Library  retells  the  celebrated  story  of  the 'Strikers  in  Saris'.  Thus,  by  the  1980s,  the  heightened  consciousness  of Black  workers  had  generated  the  need  to  form  autonomous  organisations which  pointed  the  way  ahead.  For  me  as  a  writer, The  Making was  a

watershed,  the  beginning  of  a  new  phase  in  my  intellectual  development. My quest was for a deeper truth about people and society for, in spite of their  relevance,  I  felt  there  was  too  much  of  a  cosy  woolliness  about  the prevailing  ideas  such  as  race,  class,  colour,  gender,  culture  and  religion. Something  vital  was  missing.  Thus  I  committed  myself  to  an  intense exploration  of  these  ideas  while  I  continued  to  write  about  histories, cultures and identities. The result was that twelve years after The Making , I published Reimaging Britain ,  which helped to clarify in my mind the idea of difference, of celebrating 'the creative potential of human difference'. So far so good, I thought, but not good enough.

And so fifteen years after the publication of Reimaging Britain, I took a further step and confronted head on the totalising effect of social categorisations such as race, class, tribe, colour, gender, culture and religion which  stymies  individuals  ('Striker  in  Saris',  for  example)  instead  of freeing them. Thus since The Making of the Black Working Class in Britain , given  the  making  and  remaking  process,  my  ideas  continued  to  evolve crucially from autonomous organisation to respect for difference.

Today,  the  fundamental  question  that  confronts  us  is  this:  where  are Black and ethnic minority workers located in the employment structure? As if  to  confirm  the  persistent,  stark  daily  lived  reality  of  many  working people,  a  few  reports  on  pay  and  disadvantage  have  recently  appeared. 'Analysis of pay data by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggests that the difference in average pay rates amounts to a gap of 23 percent,' stated a BBC Education  and  Social Affairs  report  titled  'Black  Workers  'earning less than white colleagues' adding that Black graduates earn less than their white counterparts, the average pay gap between Black and white workers with A-levels being 14 percent; and at GCSE level, the gap is 11 percent. So many issues raised and dealt with in The Making , including the inequities in relation to race, education and pay, still confront us. A generation on, how should we address the problem?

Frances  O'Grady,  the  TUC  General  Secretary  identified  the  problem: 'Race  still  plays  a  huge  role  in  determining  pay.'  She  added  the  'harsh reality is that at any level of education, Black and Asian workers are getting paid LESS than their white counterparts. The Government cannot afford to ignore  these  figures  and  must  now  take  genuine  action  to  tackle  pay discrimination.' And what role could or should the government play? One way forward was urgently needed 'interventions'. When  dealing  with  the

deprived  and  disadvantaged,  the  last  Labour  Government  was  convinced throughout  its  long  reign  that  the  key  to  social  mobility  was  'education, education,  education'. Alas,  whatever  the  beneficial  effects  of  the  Labour Government's  policies,  though  masked  by  self-righteous  rhetoric  (and,  at times,  exaggerated  political  correctness),  deep-seated  problems  remain. While disproportionality in the number of disadvantaged Blacks and Asians attending universities was flagged up repeatedly as a major hurdle, beyond this, there were  other consequential  inequalities to confront. Various researchers, including those at the BBC and the race equality think tank the Runnymede  Trust  have  found  that  'pay  gaps  are  not  due  to  the  type  of university  attended,  they  even  extend  to  Black  workers  with  degrees'.  In fact,  the  TUC's  analysis,  based  on  the  Labour  Force  Survey  figures  from 2014 and 2015, shows the pay gaps were widest among the more qualified. And so education is not working for the benefit of the aspirant as it should. This  is  shocking.  Such  evidence  of  'pay  gaps'  is  confirmed  by  recent findings of the University of Essex and the Institute of Economic and Social Research. The  implications  of  these  workplace  inequalities  on  the  rest  of society  are  significant.  Furthermore,  the  British  Referendum  on  23  June 2016, which resulted in the British people's decision to leave the European Union,  will,  no  doubt,  have  unknown  consequences  for  migrant  workers, especially Blacks and Asians.

Given repeated demands for change, indeed the need for 'interventions', the Prime Minister, concerned with developing a race-equality educational strategy  said,  'Transparency  would  force  top  universities  like  Oxford  to work harder to broaden their intake.' Fine words from the leading politician, but in spite of his 'intervention' a few weeks later, on 14 September 2016, an Evening  Standard headline  read:  'POLICE  DO  TARGET  BLACK PEOPLE.' In the article Scotland Yard's new diversity chief, Victor Olisa, a Black man, admitted 'stop and search' on the streets targeted Black people. Thirty  years  earlier  in The  Making , I  had  written  at  length  about  'sus charges',  Black  youth  and  confrontations  between  Black  people  and  the police. Now, with great interest, I read that the police were still 'routinely discriminating  against  Black  people  in  stop  and  search  operations  in London  as  part  of  a  misguided  performance  culture'.  Furthermore,  the diversity  chief  attested  that  'it  was  accepted  practice  to  stop  young  black men to try to boost arrest rates for drugs such as cannabis'. To avoid the 'negative stereotyping of black people', he felt stop and search should not

only be based on intelligence, but most importantly officers should be able 'to  explain  as  an  individual  why  you  stopped  Joe  Bloggs'.  This  official statement points to the very essence of the evolving ideas contained in The Making that  culminated in the recent publication of my original essay On Respect  for  Difference . Given  that  'difference  is the DNA  of  social relations', crucially I concluded the essay in relation to migrations and the globalized  world  thus:  'Like  Britain,  few  countries  can  claim  to  have  an 'indigenous'  population.  But  wherever  human  beings  congregate  in  socalled civilized communities and societies, the insistent calls for 'freedom' and  'human  rights'  would  indeed  remain  elusive,  meaningless  slogans, unless people genuinely relate to each other with respect for difference .'

Against this background, in scope and depth, educationally the value of The Making of the Black Working Class in Britain is as timely now (if not more so) as it was when it first appeared: an instructive, informative text for readers  regardless  of  age,  race,  class,  colour,  gender,  culture  or  religion about  a  crucial  period  in  our  past.  It  is  at  once  of  major  historical  and contemporary  significance;  an  educational  resource  that  crucially  adds  to our  understanding  of  neglected  aspects  of  British  history.  The  oft-quoted historian  Peter  Fryer,  in  his  'Suggestion  for  Further  Reading'  on  Black history  stated,  'Some  gaps  in  this  cursory  reading  are  due  to  gaps  in  the literature  …  One  at  least  of  these  gaps  will  be  filled  by  Ron  Ramdin's forthcoming  history  of  the  black  working  class  in  Britain.'  In  fact The Making is about a great deal more. Significantly this new edition is the first book to incorporate a 'forgotten' and little known aspect of 'British' history which  hitherto  chroniclers  of  the  Black  presence  have  either  not  known about  or  had  overlooked:  for  many  people,  Dadabhai  Naoroji,  elected  in 1892 is known as the first Black MP. But new research refutes this. The first Black Member of Parliament was James Townsend, whose election to the House of Commons predates Naoroji by some 125 years. He was also the first  Black  Lord  Mayor  of  London.  (For  more  on  the  fascinating  story  of James  Townsend,  see  Appendix  VI.)  And  so The  Making  of  the  Black Working  Class  in  Britain ,  described  thirty  years  ago  by The  Times as  a 'pioneering' book continues to enlighten us. Its republication is a rare event which  gives  due  recognition  of  its  place  in  British  history,  culture  and society.

The 'Blackamoores' Presence (1555-1900)

## 1 Profits, Slavery and the Black Poor

The long standing presence of black people in Britain dates back to Roman times.  By  the  seventeenth  century  many  were  employed  as  servants, pageant performers, court jesters and musicians. Later, this black presence would  become  significant  as  trade  and  economic  expansion  forged  a fundamental  connection  between  the  demands  of  British  capitalism  and black labour. Indeed, it was argued that Negro slavery and the slave trade were  responsible  for  providing  the  capital  which  financed  the  Industrial Revolution in England and of 'mature' industrial capitalism which, in turn, destroyed the slave system. 1 Since this thesis was propounded, it has been hotly disputed and debated by historians. The purpose here is not to pursue this  argument,  directly.  Nevertheless,  a  significant  consequence  of  the commerce and trade in slaves, cotton and sugar was that black people began to appear in England in increasing numbers. And throughout the period of slavery,  and  thereafter,  black  labour  has  remained  a  crucial  factor  in  the development of the British economy.

The rise of African slavery

The  arrival  of  Christopher  Columbus  in  the  New  World  had  far-reaching consequences.  England  joined  Spain  and  Portugal  in  their  rivalry  over actual  and  potential  colonial  possessions  as  a  result  of  Cabot's  voyage  to North  America  in  1497.  By  1580  the  English  government  sought  to implement the principle of effective occupation in determining sovereignty. In  the  struggle  for  possession  in  the  West  Indies,  the  'Iberian  Axis'  was challenged by England, France and Holland. In this struggle for a 'place in the  sun',  as  Eric  Williams  put  it,  'The  negro,  too,  was  to  have  his  place, though he did not ask for it: it was the broiling sun of the sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations of the New World.' 2

In  the  ensuing  years,  the  English  claim  to  colonial  possessions  grew. The major economic determinant of prosperity in a new colony, according to  Adam  Smith,  the  English  economist,  was  'plenty  of  good  land'.  Not surprisingly, by 1776, British colonial possessions were already divided into two types, the self-sufficient and diversified economy of small farmers and the  colony  with  facilities  for  the  large-scale  production  of  staples  for  an export market. The northern colonies of the American mainland were in the first category, while the mainland tobacco colonies and the sugar islands of the  Caribbean  fell  in  the  second.  Given  that  both  land  and  capital  were useless unless labour could be controlled and disciplined, labour became of primary concern to the British colonial planter.

To  achieve  the  maximum  gains,  the  kind  of  labour  required  on  the plantations  had  to  be  constant  and  able  to  work  in  co-operation.  These demands resulted in a dispersal of the rugged individualist small farmers. The alternative for the Caribbean colonies was slavery. This system was an economic  institution  of  the  first  importance,  a  key  factor  in  large-scale plantation production. As one historian saw it:

In modern times it provided the sugar for the tea and coffee cups of the  Western  world.  It  produced  the  cotton  to  serve  as  a  base  for modern capitalism. It made the American South and the Caribbean islands. Seen in historical perspective, it forms a part of that general picture  of  the  harsh  treatment  of  the  underprivileged  classes,  the unsympathetic poor laws and severe feudal laws, and the indifference with which the rising capitalist class was 'beginning to reckon prosperity in terms of sacrificing human life to the deity of increased production'. 3

While slaves and land-hunger moved in tandem, the role of the African in slavery  became  crucial.  Although  slavery  in  the  Caribbean  has  been narrowly identified with the African, it is clear that a racial twist had been invented  and  superimposed  on  what  was  fundamentally  an  economic institution. For slavery was not the result of racism but rather, racism was the consequence of slavery. 4 Before the African, unfree labour in the New World  was  brown,  white,  black  and  yellow.  In  fact,  the  first  instance  of slave trading and slave labour developed in the New World involveds not the 'Negro' but the Indian. Indian slavery, never sufficiently extensive in the British  Dominions,  did  not  interfere  with  African  slavery.  The  planters demanded  sheer  physical  strength  for  the  future  production  of  the  New World staples, sugar and cotton. This, they felt, the Indians lacked. Indeed, the Spaniards had already sought in 1518 that 'permission be given to bring Negroes, a race robust for labour, instead of natives so weak that they can only be employed in tasks requiring little endurance, such as taking care of maize  fields  or  farms'. 5 The  epithets  'cotton  nigger'  and  'sugar  mules' became common usage. While the supply of Indians was limited, that of the African  was  plentiful.  Thus,  with  time,  the  system  of  slavery  forged  an inseparable link between West Africa and the West Indies.

It is important to point out, however, that the immediate successor of the Indian was the poor white, not the African. These white servants comprised indentured servants, 'redemptioners' and convicts. Between 1654 and 1685 a regular traffic developed in these indentured servants; ten thousand sailed from  Bristol  to  the  West  Indies  and  Virginia.   In  1683,  one-sixth  of 6 Virginia's  population  were  white  servants. As  the  trade  in  white  servants prospered, commercial  speculation  encouraged  abuses. Kidnapping  in London and Bristol became part of a regular business. Convicts provided another  source  of  steady  labour.  While  Benjamin  Franklin  opposed  this 'dumping upon the New World of the outcasts of the Old' the West Indies was  prepared  to  accept  'even  the  spawn  of  Newgate  and  Bridewell'.  In effect,  these  colonies  became  the  dumping  ground  for  the  'riff-raff'  of British society. 7

Moreover, the political and civil disturbances in England between 1640 and  1740  helped  to  supply  white  servants.  Transportation,  mostly  to  the sugar  islands,  was  the  penalty  imposed  on  political  and  religious  nonconformists, such as Cromwell's Irish prisoners who were sent to the West

Indies. Transportation was actively associated with the West Indies to the extent that to 'Barbadoes' a person became a verb in the English vernacular.

As  trading  links  grew  stronger,  the  transportation  of  servants  and convicts produced a powerful vested interest in England. Indeed, when the Colonial Board was set up in 1661 one of its more important duties was to control  the  trade  in  indentured  servants.  By  the  end  of  the  seventeenth century,  the  aim  of  economic  policy  in  England  was  the  development  of industry, the promotion of employment and the encouragement of exports. But,  the  question  of  emigration  from  the  home  country  to  the  colonies produced  a  serious  debate.  In  the  context  of  the  argument  that  'whatever tends to the depopulation of a Kingdom tends to the impoverishment of it', a British population drain was costly and had to be stemmed. A policy of drawing on cheap labour from elsewhere to people the colonial plantations was  under  serious  consideration.  By  then,  the  Royal  Family  had  already given patronage to the Royal African Company and the African slave trade. Thus, Africa aided British capitalism in launching its process of industrialisation.

By 1680 there was already evidence 8  (in Barbados) that the African was more  suited  to  the  demands  of  production  than  the  European.  It  seemed clear then that white servitude had no place in a system of chattel slavery. The  servant's  loss  of  liberty  was  for  a  short  period  of  time,  while  the African was a slave for life. Furthermore, the servants' status was passed on to their offspring, but African children assumed the status of their mother. The servants also had rights. In the final analysis, the fact that the Negro slave was cheaper proved to be decisive. The cost of securing a white man's services  for  ten  years  could  buy  an  African  for  life! 9 The  Governor  of Barbados stated that 'three blacks work better and cheaper than one white man'. 10

The experience of one trade served as a rough guide for another. Not surprisingly, therefore, Bristol, the hub of the white servants trade, played the role as one of the centres of the slave trade.

The  reason  for  the  origin  of  negro  slavery  then,  was  economic,  not racial;  it  was  the  cheapness  of  labour  rather  than  the  colour  of  the  labour which was decisive. Features such as hair and colour were the subsequent rationalisations to justify the simple economic fact that to fill the vacuum of colonial labour requirements, African labour was resorted to because it was

cheapest and best. Moreover, it is important to understand that where the whites disappeared, the cause was not the climate, but the replacement of the  small  farm  by  the  large  plantation  and  its  consequent  demand  for  a large,  cheap  and  steady  labour  supply.  African  slavery's  origin  can  be expressed in terms of three plantation products: sugar, tobacco and cotton. A change in the economic structure produced a corresponding change in the labour supply. In the Caribbean slave society King Sugar reigned supreme. This  was  a  society  in  which  there  were  only  two  necessary  classes  -  the wealthy (absentee) planters and the oppressed slaves, the exploiters and the exploited.

## Profits

In comparison with the wealthy planters of the sugar islands, the planters in the  tobacco  colonies  came  a  poor  second.  The  West  Indian  sugar  planter was among the biggest capitalists in the mercantilist era. Indeed, the West Indian (with wealth beyond dispute) was dramatised in a play at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London in 1771. 11 He became a familiar figure in the English social scene in the eighteenth century. But why was he lording it in England when he should have been attending to his fortune-making sugar plantations  in  the  West  Indies?  The  answer  must  be  sought  in  absentee landlordism; 12 the 'curse of the Caribbean'.

Absenteeism  affected  the  prosperity  of  the  islands.  One  of  the  more serious consequences  was  the  mismanagement  of  the  plantations by overseers. There was also the growing imbalance between the whites and the  black  slave  populations.  The  slave  population  increased  making  the prospect of rebellions real. Nevertheless, risk-taking was incidental to the fundamental fact that slavery meant wealth.

Among  the  absentee  landlords  of  the  sugar  plantations,  the  most prominent were the Beckfords, an old Gloucestershire family. Sir Thomas Beckford  was  among  the  first  absentee  proprietors,  getting  £2000  per annum net (of all charges) from his Jamaican holdings. 13  Another member of  the  family,  Peter  Beckford,  became  the  most  distinguished  of  the  new colonists, holding military and civil positions in Jamaica. When he died in 1710,  he  left  'the  largest  property  real  and  personal  of  any  subject  in

Europe'. 14 In 1737 William, his grandson, with the inheritance of the family wealth became 'the most powerful West Indian planter in England'.

Another  family  with  West  Indian  interests  were  the  Hibberts.  They operated as planters and merchants, supplying cotton and linen checks for the plantations and the African market. The income received from his West Indian property was enough to enable Robert Hibbert to live comfortably in Bedfordshire.  The  abolition  of  slavery  brought  its  compensation  to  the Hibberts. They received £31,120 for their 1618 slaves. 15

The  Long  family  were  also  connected  with  Jamaica.  When  Charles Long died he left property in Suffolk, a house in Bloomsbury and 14,000 acres of property in Jamaica. His income 'by far the largest enjoyed by any Jamaican proprietor of that period' 16 entitled him to live in splendour.

Planters  and  merchants  both  reaped  vast  profits  from  the  West  Indian trade. The merchants were particularly fortunate. Professor Namier argued that there were 'comparatively few big merchants in Great Britain in 1761 who, in one connection or another, did not trade with the West Indies, and a considerable number of gentry families had interests in the Sugar Islands, just as vast numbers of Englishmen now hold shares in Asiatic rubber or tea plantations or oil fields'. 17 Relations between the two groups however, were not without problems. Planters and merchants belonged to separate organisations. And  in  spite  of  their  common  bond  (credit),  their  interests were,  at  times,  opposed.  The  basic  area  of  conflict  was  the  planters' determination to maintain monopoly prices. In 1793 conflict between them increased considerably as the planters' struggled for a grant of direct trade to Europe.  Ultimately,  as  the  capitalist  class,  their common  interests outweighed their inter-group antagonisms.  About 1780, planters and merchants  combined  in  an  effort  to  defend  their  monopoly  against  the gathering forces of free trade.

In the eighteenth century planters and merchants, working with colonial agents,  became  the  powerful West  India  interest. Together,  they  exploited West  Indian  resources  to  the  hilt,  making  large  fortunes.  To  maintain  the level of profitability in the age of rotten boroughs, the wealth of those with West  Indian  interests  very  often  proved  decisive  during  Parliamentary debates. Votes and rotten boroughs were bought. Once in Parliament their competition (and who could successfully compete against them!) increased the  price  of  seats.  Elections  were  no  longer  foregone  conclusions  for  the

English landed aristocracy. In fact, they were indignant and baffled by the West  Indians  at  elections.  This  was  not  surprising  especially  when  one recalls that in the 1830 elections a West Indian planter was elected in Bristol having spent £18,000. 18 Money, however, could not buy every Parliamentary seat. Nevertheless, a large fortune more often than not was the barometer which measured political power and influence. The Beckford dynasty,  for  example,  was  well-represented  in  Parliament  in  accordance with their wealth. 19 In addition to the Beckfords, Richard Pennant represented  Liverpool,  one  of  the  Barbados  Codringtons  was  an  MP  in 1737,  Edward  Colston  held  the  Bristol  seat  from  1710  to  1713,  George Hibbert  represented  Seaford  from  1806  to  1812  and  John  Gladstone represented Woodstock and, later, Lancaster.

Because of the impulse given to trade and agriculture in England, Henry Goulburn in 1833 was still pleading with Parliament to look at the towns that had sprung up as a consequence of the connection with the colonies. 20 It was difficult to ignore the West Indians; their presence mattered. Ten out of fifteen members of an influential Committee of the Society of Planters and  Merchants  held  seats  in  Parliament. 21 In  effect,  the  slave  traders  and slave-owners were entrenched both in the Commons and in the House of Lords.  From  these  powerful  positions  they  were  able  to  repel  attacks  on their plantations and their social structure. In the balancing act of give and take,  peerages  were  conferred  in  return  for  political  support. There  was  a hard ring of truth in the statement that there were few, if any, noble houses in England without a West Indian.

The slave-owners not only dominated Parliament, but they had an allpervasive  effect  as  aldermen,  mayors  and  councillors.  William  Beckford was  not  only  an  Alderman  for  the  City  of  London,  but  also  twice  Lord Mayor. 22

Nevertheless,  the  West  Indian  interest  was  the 'enfant  terrible of English politics until American Independence struck the first great blow at mercantilism  and  monopoly'. 23   In  1764  there  were  fifty  or  sixty  West Indian  voters  who  held  the  balance  of  power. 24 The  West  Indian  sugar interest  was  enjoying  the  heyday  of  its  power.  But  although  sugar  (and monopoly) would be replaced by cotton (and laissez-faire ) in the eighteenth century,  sugar  remained  supreme  throughout  this  period.  The  vast  profits made  by  the  slave  traders,  slave-owners,  planters  and  merchants  were

openly displayed in England. Indeed, such West Indian wealth courted the displeasure of King George III who, on a visit with Pitt, having encountered a  wealthy  Jamaican  is  reported  to  have  said,  'Sugar,  sugar,  eh?  all that sugar!  How  are  the  duties,  eh,  Pitt,  how  are  the  duties?' 25 Duties  or  no duties, given absentee landlordism, the fact remains that West Indian profits were  spent  in  England.  In  short,  it  was  all  to  the  benefit  of  the  home country.

As the slave trade developed and sugar became King (later succeeded by  cotton  in  the  United  States)  many  Blacks  were  brought  to  the  mother country by their masters; a living reminder of the slavery-profits nexus. On the  question  of  this  fundamental  relationship  two  distinguished  black historians have reached significant conclusions: C. L. R. James suggested in his  history 26 of  the  Haitian  Slave  Revolution  and  the  rise  of  Toussaint L'Ouverture that Britain abolished the slave trade and slavery for economic reasons.  Six  years  later,  Eric  Williams  in Capitalism  and  Slavery 27 also showed how economic rather than humanitarian reasons led to the abolition of  the  slave  trade  and  slavery  in  Britain.  While  few  would  dispute  these conclusions,  logically,  one  might  well  ask:  how  did  the  black  slaves  in Britain live and how did they become 'free'?

## Pets and domestic servants

Before John Hawkins sold his first group of Africans into slavery in 1563, towards the end of 1555, John Lok had already returned from his second voyage bringing to England with him 'certaine black slaves, whereof some were  tall  and  strong  men,  and  could  wel  agree  with  our  meates  and drinkes'. 28 Naturally, the 'colde and moyst' air offended the Africans. This was  the inauspicious beginning  of the importation by  the Merchant Adventurers of Blacks from West Africa into England. Over the next two and  a  half  centuries  the  trade  between  West  Africa,  the  Caribbean,  the Americas  and  England  grew  enormously.  Consequently,  the  number  of Blacks in Britain increased.

The  commercial  probings  of  the  Merchant  Adventurers  opened  up  a new world, the world of the black peoples. Thus from the 1550s, the Blacks became a haunting and focal point of political debate among the ruling class in England. By the late sixteenth century, the Englishman no longer resorted

to reading exotic and fantastic tales about the African. Indeed, the African had become human, a real presence on the streets of English seaports, in London and more particularly, as 'pets' and domestic servants in wealthy English households. 29 Among some members of the English working class, the Black had become an object of envy who, it was argued, did not have to worry  about  the  next  meal. 30 By  the  end  of  the  century,  as  cheap  black labour was sought, there had been a considerable increase in the number of Blacks in England. 31 Initially, these Africans were brought to assist English traders who ventured to Africa. A rare sight, the English were curious about the  black  persons  they  saw.  Indeed,  in  social  circles  they  were  highly valued. Increasingly, black slave domestics became part of noble households. This early contact with West Africans was to have far-reaching consequences.  Queen  Elizabeth  I  gave  her  blessings  to  African  slavetrading,  bestowing  a  knighthood  on  the  slave-trader,  John  Hawkins,  who used  one  of  the  Queen's  ships,  the Jesus on  his  second  slave-trading voyage. 32 As the trade in human cargo between Africa and the New World developed,  more  Africans  arrived  in  England  as  the  property  of  whites, 'human ballast' for sale or to be used at will.

During the first two centuries of black settlement in England, the most common  form  of  work  for  black  workers  was  found  within  the  servant class. 33 As their numbers grew, their employers became less exclusive. By the late sixteenth century, for example, black servants were employed not only close to the Court, but by those of humbler status. 34 Many years later Samuel Johnson's black servant,  Francis  Barber,  was  fortunate  enough  to receive an annual income of £100 after his master's death. This, however, was an exceptional case of good fortune.

Among the Africans, most of whom lived in London (a reflection of the mercantile  importance  of  the  city),  a  few  became  'relatively  prosperous residents'. In fact, a group of Blacks were able to build their own house in London in 1597. 35  Although they did not conform to 'building regulations', they  nevertheless  showed  an  independence  quite  at  variance  with  the received attitude of contemporary Englishmen.

By  the  end  of  the  sixteenth  century,  the  black  presence  had  become noticeable  to  no  lesser  person  than  the  Queen.  The  growth  of  a  black minority in London was, to say the least, assuming the proportions of a real problem. The social problem which faced England, as poverty, famine and

hunger spread over the country, had adverse effects on the Blacks who were singled out for special treatment. Queen Elizabeth alerted the mayors of the major  cities  'that  there  are  of  late  divers  blackamoores  brought  into  this realm, of which  kind of people there are allready here too manie considerynge howe God hath blessed this land with great increase of people of  our  owne  nation  as  anie  countrie  in  the  world'. 36 Accordingly,  she ordered 'that those kinde of people should be sente forth of the land'. In her deportation  order,  she  identified  the  Africans  imported  by  Sir  Thomas Baskerville. 37 She  had  objected  to  black  settlement  in  July  1596  and repatriation was already becoming a preoccupation by the beginning of the seventeenth century. An order was issued to hand over all black servants to the Lubeck merchant, Van Senden, emphasising that Her Majesty's subjects should  'be  served  by  their  owne  countrymen  (rather)  than  those  kind  of people'. 38 The Blacks had become a 'problem' to the extent that in January 1601,  the  Queen  issued  a  proclamation  to  deport  'such  Negroes  and blackamoores which … are carried into this realm … who are fostered and powered here, to the great annoyance of her own liege people'. 39  Already Blacks were being set apart from the rest of the British people. As the slave trade entered into high-gear, in addition to direct importation from Africa, more and more Blacks entered Britain via slavery in the West Indies and in North America where, particularly after the War of Independence, the black slaves who had fought on the British side were promised their freedom.

## Liberty

The presence of black slaves in Britain introduced a new social 'problem'. The ownership of human beings as property was a challenge to the common law. This was reflected in a number of slave cases in which contradictory decisions  were  taken,  indicating  confusion  and  uncertainty  in  the  law.  In 1729, however, in an attempt to clarify any misunderstanding about slaves becoming  free  on  entry  to  England  or  Ireland,  or  as  a  result  of  being baptised,  the  Solicitor-General  and  the  Attorney  General  were  of  the opinion  that  a  slave  coming  from  the  West  Indies  to  Great  Britain  or Ireland,  with  or  without  a  master  was  not  free,  and  that  the  master's property or right in the slave was not thereby determined or varied; and that baptism  did  not  bestow  freedom  on  him  or  made  any  alteration  in  his

temporal  condition.  They  added,  'We  are  also  of  opinion  that  his  master may legally compel him to return again to the plantations.' 40

Known  as  the  Yorke-Talbot  opinion,  this  view  prevailed,  upholding slavery in England until 1772, when the case of the runaway slave Somerset was  heard  in  the  Court  of  King's  Bench  before  Lord  Chief  Justice Mansfield. The case is regarded as a 'watershed' in English legal history. In the case Lord Mansfield effectively decided that a slave could not forcibly be  taken  abroad  by  his  master  against  his  wishes.  The  case  also  had historical significance in showing the positions of contemporary schools of thought on the slave question.

The verdict on the Somerset case was indeed of great significance to the anti-slavery  movement.  In  spite  of  this  decision,  however,  the  practice  of taking slaves forcibly from  England  continued  after 1772.  The law remained  defective,  offering  no  protection  to  the  'free'  black  person  in England  from  unlawful  enslavement.  Slavery  in  the  colonies  then  was  a rude  reminder  to  the  Blacks  of  their  confused  status  in  Britain. As  F.  O. Shyllon  argued,  it  was  not  until  1834  that  it  can  truly  be  said  that  black slaves in Britain were emancipated, as were their fellow Blacks in the West Indies. 41

## Free black voices

Among the 'free' Blacks there were a few who spoke out on the intolerable conditions  of  slavery  and  the  plight  of  the  black  poor  in  Britain.  Having come  'Up  from  Slavery'  in  the  upsurge  of  abolitionist  sentiment  in  the 1780s outstanding contributions came from three Africans, Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano and Olaudah Equiano, amongst others. They were all men of  letters.  Cugoano  and  Equiano  both  wrote  essentially  for  publication, while Sancho was published posthumously. Indeed, Sancho became the best known African in London. He was the author of a book on the theory of music  and  appeared  on  the  stage.  These  talented  Blacks  appealed  to  the liberal instincts of a few distinguished Englishmen. In fact, at this time, the pro-abolition  campaign  to  arouse  British  public  opinion  against  slavery through  petitions  (given  missionary  zeal,  the  growth  of  non-conformism and  humanitarian  agitational  pressure)  had  begun  to  receive  widespread support from radicals and the British working class.

Such men as Garrick and Sterne were among Cugoano's friends, and his portrait was painted by Gainsborough. 42  He was best known, however, for the representations made on behalf of his unfortunate fellow Blacks. In his campaign, he solicited the help of Laurence Sterne by drawing attention to the acute distress of the black poor in London. They needed food, clothing and shelter, and many were desperate and dying he argued. In 1797, in his Thoughts  and  Sentiments Cugoano  denounced  the  evil  of  slavery  and pleaded  for  human  dignity;  for  kindness  and  mercy,  not  transportation  to Sierra  Leone. 43 Moreover,  he  cited  the  appalling  lack  of  consideration  of the British government by elaborating the real difficulties of the ill-advised plan of settlement in West Africa for London's black poor. 44

More  political  than  either  Sancho  or  Cugoano  was  Equiano.  His autobiography, published in 1789, made him famous. 45  He gives a detailed and moving account of how he and his sister were kidnapped in Africa and taken  aboard  a  slave  ship. After  years  in  slavery,  he  was  employed  as  a sailor and gained much experience on vessels plying the Caribbean waters and beyond. He travelled as far as the North Pole.

In  1774  he  set  out  with  Captain  John  Hughes  from  the Thames,  on  a ship  called Anglicania bound  for  Smyrna,  in  Turkey.  On  the  journey  he acted  as  steward  and  John  Annis,  a  'clever  black  man'  was  the  cook. Equiano told how Annis, after two months on board ship was hounded by a Mr.  William  Kirkpatrick,  a  'gentleman'  of  St.  Kitts,  from  whom  he  had parted  by  consent.  Kirkpatrick  nevertheless  sought  to  have Annis  back  in bondage. After several unsuccessful attempts to 'trepan him' (and when all attempts at kidnapping proved abortive) Kirkpatrick with six men and two boats boarded Equiano's ship, tied Annis and forcibly took him away as the crew and the chief mate looked on. This lack of response on the part of the ship's company to retrieve Annis, troubled Equiano. 'I believe', he wrote, 'that  this  was  a  combined  piece  of  business.' 46 And  any  vague  ideas  he might  have  had  about  the  goodness  of  the  Captain  were  now  clearly revealed. He added, 'but, at any rate, it certainly reflected great disgrace on the  mate  and  captain  also,  who,  although  they  had  desired  the  oppressed man to stay on board, yet he did not in the least assist or recover him, or pay me a farthing of his wages, which was about five pounds'. 47  Given his own suffering  and  experience  of  slavery,  and  having  borne  witness  to  the

suffering  of  others,  no  wonder  Equiano  was  moved  to  give  voice  to  the voiceless.

## Enemies and friends

## Enemies

While the black writers pleaded the cause of the slave and the black poor, between  1750  and  1838  the  anti-abolitionists'  arguments  centred  on  the personality traits and physical features of the African slave. Over generations, the prejudice of white racists against the African had imbued the popular consciousness with certain 'characteristic' traits peculiar to the African. A  desperate  anti-Black  campaign  was  mounted  on  behalf  of  the planters' interest to counteract the struggle for black freedom.

In their accounts of slave life and 'scientific observations' of the African in West Africa and the West Indies, bourgeois writers furthered the planters' propaganda. The literary talents of these propagandists were supported by West  Indian  properties  and  metropolitan  interests  that  were  interlocked. Indeed,  the  absentee  planters  offered  their  explanations  (or  prejudices) based on past experiences on the plantations.

Edward Long was one such planter. Born in 1734, he lived in Jamaica for  twelve  years.  His History  of  Jamaica ,  published  in  1774,  became  'a classic description of the machinery of colonial government on the eve of the  American  Revolution'.  Long  certainly  had  strong  views  about  the African. While he must be credited with being outspoken, his feelings about Africans were instructive and must not go unnoticed. In fact, as a respected author,  he  made  'scholarly'  references  to  support  his  arguments,  and  was widely  read  by  a  captive  audience.  In  a  burst  of  unscientific  nonsense, revealing  a  preoccupation  with  black  sexuality,  he  wrote:  'I  do  not  think that  an  orang-outang  husband  would  be  any  dishonour  to  an  Hottentot female for what are these Hottentots?' In describing the Hottentot Black as 'one of the meanest nations on the face of the earth', 48 Long, the successful exploiter of black slaves, betrayed much about himself and his society of British planters. Having  attempted  a  debasement  of  the  black  man's physique to a subhuman level, he went on to insult his intellectual faculties, his diet and eating habits, (and most interestingly) expressed his alarm over their  alleged  sexual  capacity.  'Their  hearing  is  remarkably  quick',  he

observed, adding 'their faculties of smell and taste are truly bestial, nor less so their commerce with the other sex; in these acts they are libidinous and shameless  as  monkies,  or  baboons. The  equally  hot  temperament  of  their women has given probability to the charge of their admitting these animals frequently  to  their  embrace.' 49 So  much  for  Long's  sexual  fantasies!  A pleasure rooted in racism; the oppressor justifying oppression and exploitation through his own weakness?

Another pro-slavery book, a History of the British Colonies in the West Indies ,  was  written  by  Bryan  Edwards in 1793. In recognising the simple fact that the degrading nature of slavery had the effect of conditioning the behaviour of the slaves, he made pronouncements on the morality of sex. Edwards denied that, in reality, the Negro had any 'visions of romance' or capacity for a caring relationship with the opposite sex. 50

Fifty-six years later, The Nigger Question ,  written by Thomas Carlyle, was published. He was particularly abusive and dismissive of Blacks. As far as he was concerned, from his comfortable bourgeois perch, Africans were 'all  very  happy  and  doing  very  well'.  West  Indian  Whites,  on  the  other hand, were unhappy. One might well ask how he arrived at this incredible conclusion. The clue to the answer, it would seem, is in the fact that this relative concern  over  the  slave/white  relationship  in  the  West  Indies afforded  him  the  opportunity  of  a  larger  bone  to  pick  nearer  home.  He contrasted the impoverished Whites with the Blacks thus:

But,  thank  Heaven,  our  interesting  Black  population  -  equalling almost in number of heads one of the Ridings of Yorkshire, and in worth (in quantity of intellect, faculty, docility, energy, and available human valor and value) perhaps one of the streets of Seven Dials are  all  doing  remarkably  well.  'Sweet  blighted  lillies'  -  as  the American epitaph on the Nigger child has it - Sweet blighted lillies, they are holding up their heads again! How pleasant, in the universal bankruptcy  abroad,  and  dim  dreary  stagnancy  at  home,  as  if  for England too there remained nothing but to suppress Chartist riots, banish  united  Irishmen,  vote  the  supplies,  and  wait  with  arms crossed till black Anarchy and Social Death devoured us also; as it has  done  the  others;  how  pleasant  to  have  always  this  fact  to  fall back upon: our beautiful Black darlings are at last happy; with little

labour  except  to  the  teeth,  which  surely,  in  those  excellent  horsejaws of theirs, will not fail! 51

He saw oppressed Blacks and Whites as being forced by hunger to labour for their living and feared that an emancipated West Indies would be turned into a 'Black Ireland'. Further, he likened such a reality to be stronger than a nightmare dream. 52 He refused to explore the question of African rights. And with a facile consideration, he excused himself from further discussion by saying what 'a complex' thing it was.

In 1859, Anthony Trollope joined the chorus of racist writers with the publication The  West  Indies  and  the  Spanish  Main . He,  too,  showed  a preoccupation with 'the black skin and thick lip' of the 'Negro', drawing a distinction between that strange race of creole 'Negroes' born out of Africa and those born within. He derided the black slave for having 'no language of  their  own'  and  for  speaking  'broken  English'  as  uneducated  foreigners always speak a foreign language. The lack of educational opportunities was the farthest thing from his mind. In fact, his view of the African was that he was capable of the hardest physical work which could be endured 'probably with  less  bodily  pain  than  men  of  any  other  race'.  Nonetheless,  he  was 'idle, unambitious as to worldly position, sensual, and content with little'. 53 This was his raison d'être for not educating the black man who was forced to eke out the barest existence, yet was seen as being 'content with little'! Trollope  bowed  to  the  deity  of  profits,  emphasising  his  concern  for competition and the labour market. One might well ask, what indeed did the rich planters and merchants (whom Trollope and others have so staunchly defended) give in return for the vast profits they reaped at the expense of the cheap, mercilessly exploited labour of generations of enslaved Blacks?

The  slave  trade  and  Negro  slavery  had  been  a  matter  of  conscience  for many English philanthropists who sought to educate public opinion about the  black  slave.  The  pro-planters  and  merchants  lobby  had  to  face  a countervailing  force  described  as  'The  Humanitarian  Impulse'.  Granville Sharp, one of the guiding lights among the philanthropists gave shape and direction to the humanitarian movement. He was in close contact with the slaves in London and became controversial in dealing with their problems. In  1765,  he  rescued  an  ill-used  slave  Jonathan  Strong,  who  in  1769  was

recaptured  and  jailed.  Sharp's  determination  in  rescuing  him  again  was followed by Strong's 'owner' David Lisle taking legal action against Sharp whose  lawyers  advised  him  that  because  of  the  Yorke-Talbot  opinion  of 1729,  Lisle  had  a  strong  legal  case.  Not  to  be  outdone,  Sharp  undertook research to prove that slavery in England was unlawful. In 1769 the result of  his  research, A  Representation  of  the  Injustice …  was  published.  His fight against English slavery was rewarded with the famous judgement on the  Somerset  case  in  1772.  Throughout  the  case,  Sharp  played  a  crucial role, directing popular attention to the illegality of slavery in England. This case was used as a platform for political organisation and propaganda in the campaign for abolition and emancipation.

John Wesley also rallied crucial support for the philanthropist cause. In Thoughts Upon Slavery , published in 1774, he attacked British involvement in slave trading. This publication had a huge circulation in the 1780s. It was influential  in  turning  the  growing  body  of  Methodists  against  the  slave trade. Moreover, it led to extensive missionary work in the West Indies. His description of the Negro helped to restore a 'human image' which played an important part in the campaign of the abolitionist cause.

Another influential campaigner against the evils of slavery was James Ramsay. His decision to do so was the result of a visit to a disease-ridden slave ship and the appalling treatment meted out to the slaves. He took Holy Orders and became a missionary in the West Indies. His involvement with the  slaves  brought  inevitable  displeasure  to  the  planters.  This  experience served him well. On his return to England, Ramsay wrote his Essay on the Treatment  and  Conversion  of  African  Slaves . He  worked  together  with William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson and the abolitionist Quakers.

Thomas  Clarkson,  regarded  as  the  greatest  of  all  the  abolitionists, undertook the demanding and dangerous task of gathering evidence (from the  slave  traders  themselves)  against  the  slave  trade.  As  a  student  at Cambridge, his prize-winning Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species was first published in 1785. This aroused a wave of public indignation  against  the  slave-traders.  Further,  it  evoked  sympathy  for  the slave  that  was  'never  to  be  surpassed'.  And  after  Henri  Christophe  (the King  of  Haiti)  died,  his  wife  and  daughter  stayed  with  the  Clarksons. Clarkson's friend, the poet William  Wordsworth  (who  also  went  to Cambridge), aware of Clarkson's essay on slavery, recognised both Toussaint L'Ouverture and Clarkson in the following sonnets:

Toussaint, the most unhappy man of men! Whether the Whistling Rustic tends his plough Within thy hearing, or thy head be now Pillowed in some deep dungeon's earless den; O miserable Chieftain! Where and when Wilt thou find patience! Yet die not; do thou Wear rather in thy bonds a cheerful brow: Though fallen thyself, never to rise again, Live and take comfort. Thou hast left behind Powers that will work for thee; air, earth, and skies; There's not a breathing of the common wind That will forget thee: thou has great allies; Thy friends are exultations, agonies, And love, and man's unconquerable mind. 54

On the final passing of the Bill  for  the  abolition  of  the  slave  trade  in March 1807, he wrote:

Clarkson! it was an obstinate hill to climb: How toilsome - nay, how dire - it was, by thee Is known; by none, perhaps, so feelingly: But thou, who starting in thy fervent prime, Didst first lead forth that enterprise sublime, Hast heard the constant voice its charge repeat, Which, out of thy young heart's oracular seat, First roused thee - O true yorke-fellow of Time, Duty's intrepid liegeman, see, the palm Is won, and by all Nations shall be worn! The blood-stained Writing is forever torn; And thou henceforth will have a good man's calm, A great man's happiness; thy zeal shall find Repose at length, firm friend of human kind! 55

In Letters  on  Slavery ,  published  in  1789, William Dickson challenged the widespread belief in the inferiority of black men. He too had first hand experience of the debilitating effects of life on the plantations in Barbados. He pointed out that planters failed to see that the qualities they complained of  in  the  slave  stemmed  directly  from  the  life  to  which  the  slaves  were subjected.

Finally, we turn to the activities of William Wilberforce. His struggle in the  cause  of  emancipation  was  spread  over  half  a  century.  Like  Granville Sharp,  Wilberforce  was  involved  at  every  level  in  the  campaign  for  the abolition  of  slavery,  from  the  late  1780s  to  the  time  of  his  death  before Emancipation.  Against  the  impression  created  by  the  planters  and  their influential  apologists,  'that  the  indolence  of  the  Negro  race  was  utterly

incurable,  and  that  without  the  driving  whip  they  never  would  willingly engage in agricultural labour', Wilberforce argued that it has been 'shown to  be  utterly  without  foundation'.  Among  others,  he  cited  a  'striking instance'  in  Trinidad  where  the  many  hundreds  of American  'Negroes'  at the  close  of  'the  late  unhappy  war  with  the  United  States,  were,  by  the humane policy of Sir Ralph Woodford, received into Trinidad, to no small alarm  to  the  planters'. 56 Wilber-force's  overall  contribution  to  end  the system  of  slavery  has  become  well-known.  What  is  less  well  known, however, is his highly questionable position as a 'humanitarian'.

Following Carlyle's 'Discourse', John Stuart Mill entered the debate on the 'Negro' question in 1850. Despite the collapse of the sugar producing colonies, his overall argument in support of black freedom is interesting. He wrote:

Were the whites born ever so superior in intelligence to the blacks, and competent by nature to instruct and advise them, it would not be the less monstrous to assert that they had therefore a right either to subdue  them  by  force,  or  circumvent  them  by  superior  skill;  to throw  upon  them  the  toils  and  hardships  of  life,  reserving  for themselves,  under  the  misapplied  name  of  work,  its  agreeable excitements. … That this country should turn back to the matter of Negro  slavery,  I  have  not  the  smallest  apprehension.  There  is, however, another place where that tyranny still flourishes, but now for  the  first  time  finds  itself  seriously  in  danger.  At  this  crisis  of American  slavery,  when  the  decisive  conflict  between  right  and iniquity  seems  about  to  commence,  your  contributor  steps  in,  and flings this missile, loaded with the weight of his reputation, into the abolitionist  camp.  The  words  of  English  writers  of  celebrity  are words of power on the other side of the ocean; and the owners of human flesh, who probably thought they had not an honest man on their  side  between the Atlantic and the Vistula, will welcome such an auxiliary. Circulated as his dissertation will probably be by those whose interests profit by it, from one end of the American Union to the other, I hardly know of an act by which one person could have done so much mischief as this may possibly do; and I hold that by thus  acting,  he  has  made  himself  an  instrument  of  what  an  able writer in the Inquirer justly calls 'a true work of the devil'. 57

In the long debate between the 'enemies' and 'friends' (whose arguments weighed in the balance the future of the slaves) the bedrock of the  slave  system  remained  its  economic  viability.  Taking  the  issue  from there,  the  struggle  was  strengthened  by  winning  public  opinion.  For  as Walvin  argued:  'What  ultimately  doomed  slavery  was  the  anti-slavery movement  and  the  irresistible  pressure  it  exercised  via  the  public,  over Parliament  and  Governments'. 58   Indeed,  it  was  clear  that  this  economic issue with all its political implications would  only be resolved by Parliament.

## The struggle of the black poor

The black people living in England during these years were engaged in a daily struggle  for survival.  Apart  from  being  'alien',  their blackness emphasised  their  conspicuousness.  The  grim  reality  of  poverty  pushed many  to  desperation.  They  fought  on  two  main  fronts;  some  became political activists and some pugilists.

The  fight  for  survival  was  the  essential  experience  of  the  black  poor. Street life bred the art of self-defence but most of the black poor were the victims of adverse circumstances. Blacks were abused indiscriminately.

Those  born  or  brought  to  Britain  were  treated,  to  say  the  least, indecently. In short, many in the 'circus' were displayed like animals.

Poverty  was,  in  general,  synonymous  with  being  black.  The  black  poor were  among  the  'poorest  of  the  poor' in London.  Not  surprisingly, therefore,  a  large  proportion  of  London's  black  poor  were  beggars  in  the mid-1780s  and  during  the  nineteenth  century.  It  seemed  wherever  there were beggars, black people were among them. According to the Society for the Suppression of Mendicity, there were approximately 400 black beggars between 1820 and 1826, a ratio of one in every 40 beggars. 59

Barely  eking  out  an  existence  (and  in  many  cases  close  to  death)  the gradual decline in black beggary reflected a decline in the black population as a whole due to a high death rate in London and the fact that there was little fresh immigration. 60

Given that remunerative employment was hard to come by, many blacks had  to  live  by  their  wits.  Necessity  being  the  mother  of  invention,  some

mendicant Blacks were able to elude the Society's strictures. One important reason  for  keeping  out  of  reach  of  the  Society  was  the  severe  treatment Blacks received. Inevitably, some Blacks were caught and punished as were a Jamaican and a Barbadian in 1819 and 1820 respectively. 61

Deportation of Blacks loomed large as the final answer. Financing such a remedy was clearly no problem. (This was attempted earlier in the 1780s when the black poor were deported to Sierra Leone.) But deportation to the West Indies meant slavery. Blacks were caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, hunger and poverty forced them to beg and steal, while on the other, they  were  faced  with  the  possibility  of  deportation  and  slavery.  By  all accounts  then,  the  position  of  the  black  poor  in  English  society  was  a desperate  one.  Cornered  like  animals,  they  had  to  fight  for  the  barest existence.

As  they  fought  in  the  boxing  ring,  or  on  the  streets,  or  against prosecutions,  at  various  times,  they  faced  the  real  possibility  of  being imprisoned, flogged or deported.

Given  the  difficulties,  not  many  Blacks  were  prepared  to  remain beggars. Many, however, seemed to have begged at one time or another. A few who 'turned professional' did well enough to become heroes. Tribute was paid to these outstanding beggars by their peers. The black one-legged fiddler,  Billy  Waters,  was  elected  'King  of  the  Beggars'. 62 Another  wellknown 'successful' black beggar 63  was Charles McGee. Born in Jamaica in 1744 he begged at Ludgate Hill.

In the fight for survival, another section of the black community - the Lascars - were faced also with extreme hardship. The Lascars in London were Indian seamen. These men, who found England cold and inhospitable, managed to join the professional beggars.

From 1814, about 1500 Lascars living in barracks received support from the East India Company. 64  In fact, the Company paid 1 . 6 s d . a day for their board and lodging. 65 In spite of this gesture, an estimated 130 Lascars died in Britain each year from 1790 to 1810. This death rate doubled in 1813. In the winter of 1813-14, the Company admitted that at least two Lascars died each week and, on one exceptionally cold day, five died. 66 Naturally, these men  complained  at  the  treatment  they  were  receiving.  The  Company responded  predictably.  The  grumblers  were  to  be  deported  on  the  first ship. 67 In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  Lascars'  grievances  were  many,  once

again repatriation was used as the ultimate threat. But such threats were no solutions  to  the  problems  of  the  black  poor.  A  Parliamentary  Committee found that men slept on bare planks on the floor and that the barracks were often overcrowded.

Moreover, the Company openly admitted that the men in their care were the victims of acts of violence by the administrators. 68 The missionaries and magistrates showed little sympathy or understanding for the Indian seamen or  their  religious  beliefs.  But  of  course,  tolerance  was  never  enough. Racism lurked everywhere. A dark complexion was clearly objectionable. And when members and friends of the African and Asiatic Society met for dinner at a Tavern in 1816 (even with the humanitarian and friend of the Blacks Wilberforce acting as Chairman) tokenism and discrimination was seen very clearly. 69 Alas, such gross prejudice did not prevent intermarriage. Of the estimated 10,000 black people living in Britain at the beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century,  many  black  males  had  taken  white wives.

According to Peter Fryer, while black immigration to Britain dwindled, intermarriage was widespread. Consequently, these two factors contributed to a decrease (how large would be pure guesswork) of the black community during the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, there was a continuous black presence. In Liverpool (the slave port and centre of the cotton trade) research has shown that there never was a time, throughout the century,  when  the  city  did  not  have  black  citizens  and  that  these  citizens were always united by common problems and interests. 70

Despite a decrease in the number of the black poor in Britain during the nineteenth century, their essential poverty remained unaffected. So much so, that  action  of  another  kind  became  necessary;  action  based  on  common causes shared to some extent by the wider British working class.

## 2 Black Radicals and Black Women in Service

Common  problems  and  common  interests  indeed.  Through  aiding  the common  causes,  by  the  turn  of  the  nineteenth  century  the  anti-slavery campaign, in church and chapel and especially among the British working class (although there is evidence during the early 1830s of radical working class hostility) won steadily growing support. In fact, the mass anti-slavery movement  emerged  at  the  end  of  the  1780s,  reaching  peaks  in  the campaigns  for  abolition  of  the  Slave  Trade  (1788,  1792  and  1814),  for Emancipation (1823, 1830 and 1833) and for the end of 'Negro' Apprenticeship in 1838. 1

Paradoxically, in spite of this shift in British public opinion, the black people in Britain were, in various ways, forced to submit to the prejudices inherent in English society, as their fellow Blacks endured the agonies of slavery  on  the  colonial  plantations.  Significantly,  the  black  struggle  had merged  into  a  larger  movement,  with  the  black  slave  being  used  as  an argument  against  white  slavery  in  Britain.  Not  surprisingly  then,  black working class leaders were acceptable and became an integral part of the vanguard of the radical working class movement between 1800 and 1850. During  this  period,  four  exceptional  Blacks  emerged  to  channel  their

particular grievances and arguments into the mainstream of British working class  agitation.  Two  of  them,  William  Davidson  and  Robert  Wedderburn, were revolutionary socialists. They were 'members of the far left of all the radical organisations of the time', and  followers of Thomas  Spence (Secretary  of  the  London  Corresponding  Society  (LCS)  and  editor  of radical papers), who was imprisoned for his radicalism.

It is more than likely that, apart from the fact that the Spenceans were the 'farthest left of the radicals', these black radicals were also attracted to their  group  which  was  the  'most  solidly  working  class  in  composition'. Most of its members were 'mechanics and manufacturers', factory workers and shoemakers and a few soldiers and sailors. The small numbers of its membership did not detract from the quality of their group which was the only radical organisation to maintain an unbroken continuity throughout the Napoleonic wars. 2

The Spenceans, the only socialist  organisation  in  the  country,  had  the reputation of being 'the most serious, and influential group of conspirators during the post-war radical agitation'.  Spencean activists were involved in 3 the Spa Fields riots in December 1816 and some of them had contacts in Manchester,  Stockport  and  Bolton.  In  terms  of  formal  organisation,  the Spenceans were divided into sections, structurally similar to that of the old LCS.  This  influence  on  the  Spenceans  was  not  surprising  since  the  last Secretary of the LCS was Thomas Evans* (a colourer of prints and later, patent  brace-maker) 4 who  became  leader  of  the  Spenceans  after  Spence's death  in  1814.   Inevitably,  the  splits 5 and  disharmony  led  to  various Spencean  groups  operating  along  independent  lines  during  1817-1820. Robert  Wedderburn  led  one  of  these  groups  while  William  Davidson  led another.  The  other  outstanding  black  radical  devoted  to  the  British  and colonial working class struggle was the deported London Chartist, William Cuffay.  Lesser  known  (and  understandably)  is  Matthew  Bogle  who  was involved in the Scottish Insurrection of 1820.

## Robert Wedderburn

The  English  working  class  had,  by  the  early  nineteenth  century,  become sufficiently aware that their freedom was crucially dependent on their own forms of agitational organisation. Like the slaves on the colonial

plantations, they could not wait for 'a dispensation from above'. Those who followed  the  radical  tradition  risked  everything;  ultimately,  their  lives. Prison sentences were served on those who challenged the ruling class on political, religious or trade union matters, for example. Although there were 26 prosecutions for seditious and blasphemous libel in 1817, radicals of all shades  of  opinion  were  united  in  one  aim:  to  bait  authority  until  certain freedoms were won. Among the black radicals was Robert Wedderburn. A tailor  by  trade  and  leader  of  a  London-based  Spencean  Group,  he  had printed The  Forlorn  Hope .  Seen  as  a  threat  to  the  ruling  class,  he  was imprisoned.

This black man had come a long way to join the working class struggle in  Britain.  Wedderburn's  mother  was  a  slave  in  Jamaica.  His  father  was James Wedderburn, a Scot who owned large sugar plantations in Jamaica. 6 What we know is that Robert was born in Jamaica in 1762  and brought up 7 by  his  grandmother.  As  a  child  he  bore  witness  to  both  his  mother  and grandmother being flogged. This had a profound effect upon Robert. 8

A  witness  to  many  atrocities,  Wedderburn,  a  lad  of  17,  arrived  in England  in  1778.  His  first  employment  was  at  sea,  before  becoming  a jobbing tailor. He was aware during his life, particularly in England, of the great divide between rich and poor, and the importance of social status in English society. He had begun to see much of his earlier life in historical perspective. Prejudice and social injustice in his workaday experiences had sharpened his perception and honed his intelligence to a militant edge. He felt  his  earlier  work  experience could have been better.  Indeed, he was a 9 social man. Having heard a Wesleyan preacher at Seven Dials, he sought to relate fringe groups like Armenians, unorthodox Christians, Calvinists and Unitarians  with  the  rest  of  the  Christian  flock.  Togetherness,  brotherhood and  unity  was  superficial.  He  wanted  to  get  to  the  heart  of  the  Christian religion.  He  became  a  Unitarian  preacher  which  acted  as  a  cover  for  his radical  activities.  Thus,  he  became  'Reverend'  Robert  Wedderburn.  His work  as  a  Unitarian  preacher  proved  fruitful.  His  findings  in  a  pamphlet Truth,  self-supported;  or  a  refutation  of  certain  doctrinal  errors,  generally adopted in the Christian church, led him on to unorthodox directions. A few months  before  Thomas  Spence  died,  Wedderburn  came  into  contact  with him. Wedderburn was then about 51 or 52 years old. In fact, Wedderburn became a member of the Society of Spencean Philanthropists.

Wedderburn's  activities  in  the  Spencean  group  became  prominent  in March  1817  with  Parliamentary  legislation  aimed  at  suppressing  the Spenceans. Following the Act, Thomas Evans, the Spencean leader, and his young son were imprisoned for high treason, for publishing anti-landowners views. Wedderburn was now in the front line. In an effort to arouse English workers  from  their  lethargy,  he  launched  in  1817 The  Forlorn  Hope ,  a periodical through which he hoped 'to establish something of a free Press'. He used the first issue to appeal for help on behalf of Evans and his son. This  was  a  clever  move  designed  not  only  to  draw  out  those  who  were supporters of Evans, but also an attempt to establish the principle of a free press.

Among the radicals leadership was a quarrelsome issue. On his release from  jail,  Evans  clashed  with  Wedderburn.  Young  people  approved  of Wedderburn's  teachings,  applauding  'anything  that  he  ridiculed  in  the Scriptures most violent'. 10 He was sensitive about his African ancestry and was pleased with the decision of a debate concerning the right of a slave to kill  his  master. This  outcome in favour of slaves freeing themselves from their  Christian  masters  was  widely  welcomed.  Wedderburn's  undoubted influence led to his prosecution for 'sedition and blasphemy'.

Soon  after  Wedderburn's  incarceration,  the  Peterloo  massacre  took place.  The  factory  owners,  merchants  and  shopkeepers  in  Manchester, amassed  their  strength  against  a  defenceless  working  class.  The  violence and enormity of events of Peterloo and its implications were the subject of political debates and discussions on 'class war' throughout the country. 11

In Wedderburn's view the revolution was imminent. The ministers and Prince  Regent,  he  said,  were  'bloody  tyrants'.  There  were  no  two  ways about it. His commitment to the revolution was clear. He was 60, and three years  earlier he  had  engaged  in  physical  training  in  readiness  for  a confrontation with and the eventual overthrow of 'those bloody murdering thieves'. 12 He had an abiding faith in 'the poor' emerging victorious.

Given  his  Jamaican  background,  Wedderburn  was  able  to  put  in perspective the English working class struggle in the context of the Empire. As  Fryer  correctly  states,  he  was  the  first  black  activist  to  disseminate revolutionary writings from Britain in the West Indies. While urging slaves to  acquire  lands,  Wedderburn  felt  the  plight  of  White  European  poor  and Black slaves integral to the revolutionary struggle.

By the 1820s, Spenceanism had given precedence to the National Union of Working Classes, and other organisations in the early 1830s. Indeed, the ideas of Spence, were highly influential on the Socialist theories of Robert Owen. Moreover, old Spenceans played an 'important and continuous' role in London Chartism. 13  How did Wedderburn figure in these movements?

Little is known about the rest of his life, and the date and circumstances of his death, but one thing shines through in his life: the son of a slave, he was  unwilling  to  accept  slavery  in  any  form,  either  among  the  English working class or the slaves on the plantations. The class struggle was his main concern; race and colour, it seemed, were secondary. His commitment to  the  class  war  was  uncompromising.  Though  incarcerated  twice  for  his beliefs, criticised by fellow working  class leaders and spied on by informers, this black radical's revolutionary fervour on behalf of the poor and oppressed remained uncompromised. This kind of commitment resulted in the role of the Spenceans being an important and continuous one. Indeed, Spenceanism survived as a revolutionary idea in radical politics long after it ceased to function as an organised party.

## William Davidson

Born  in  1786,  William  Davidson  came  to  England  from  Jamaica. 14 Like Wedderburn,  Davidson  was  the  offspring  of  a  black  woman  and  a  white man. His father was 'Mr Attorney General Davidson', a man of considerable legal knowledge and talent, who  had several children. William, his second son, was sent to England at an early age to be educated at  a  level  suited  to  the  rank  of  his  father  and  to  further  his  own  career prospects.  In  spite  of  his  mother's  opposition  to  her  son  being  sent  to England, his father's mind was made up: he should proceed to study law.

After study and a stint at sea, Davidson became a cabinet-maker. He had read  and  supported  the  ideas  of  Thomas  Paine 15 and  had  joined  the Marylebone  Union  Reading  Society,  formed  as  a  direct  result  of  the Peterloo massacre. Like Wedderburn in his Hopkins Street chapel, Davidson  called  meetings  which  were  held  in  his  house.  Davidson's associates  and  activities  (and  his  colour)  singled  him  out  for  special surveillance.  He  was  introduced  to  George  Edwards  by  the  radical  John Harrison. Edwards, (a 'modeller of statuettes' by trade) posed as a radical to

deflect attention from his double role of police spy and agent provocateur . 16

In the deliberations  over  an  uprising  or  attempts  to  dislodge  the government,  Edwards  was  not  short  of  plans  for  dealing  with  guilty government officials. He suggested that the House of Commons should be blown  up.  This,  among  other  plans,  was  rejected  by  the  radical  leader Arthur Thistlewood on the ground that the innocent should not 'suffer with the  guilty'. As  it  happened,  an  opportunity  approximating  something they were  waiting  for  presented  itself.  It  was  announced  that  the  Cabinet  as  a whole  would  be  dining  at  Lord  Harrowby's  house  in  Grosvenor  Square. Davidson had worked for a time for Lord Harrowby who described him as 'a damned seditious fellow'. 17

The  group's  plan  was  to  kill  all  the  ministers  as  they  dined  together. This, they hoped would initiate an insurrection and lead to the formation of a  provisional  government.  Edwards'  double-dealing  had  begun  to  affect Thistlewood and his supporters who agreed to 'every detail' of a plan he suggested.

Thistlewood's group delegated to Davidson the responsibility of raising money and buying weapons at a time when working men in various parts of the  country  were  arming  to  defend  themselves  against  further  attacks  on radical  demonstrations.  Moreover,  the  group  relied  on  Davidson  to  guard their  home-made  grenades,  muskets,  pistols,  etc.  which  were  kept  in  the Cato Street loft, near Edgeware Road. Uncannily, the loft was pounced on by  police  as  the  group  made  its  final  deliberations  before  setting  out  for Grosvenor Square. In the shouting and scuffling that ensued, Thistlewood stabbed  a  policeman  to  death  and  fled.  His  escape  was  however,  only temporary.  He  was  arrested  the  next  day  at  his  hiding  place  which  was known to the spy Edwards.

As it  was,  the  long-awaited  insurrection  in  London  did  not  eventuate. Elsewhere in Barnsley, Huddersfield and Sheffield insurrections failed. In Glasgow  and  Paisley  however,  about  60,000  weavers  went  on  'spyfomented'  strike. 18 And  in  the  Battle  of  Bonnymuir  during  the  Scottish Insurrection  the  radicals  were  defeated. 19 The  spy  Alexander  Richmond played  a  key  role  in  the  downfall  of  the  Scottish  Radical  Movement. Thereafter, the Movement collapsed.

In  the  aftermath  Thistlewood,  Davidson  and  their  three  companions were put on trial for high treason. Davidson pleaded not guilty and when he suggested his colour might lead to his conviction, one of the Judges said: 'God forbid that the complexion of the accused should enter, for a single moment, into  the  consideration  of  the  jury.' 20 In  his  defence,  he  told  the Court  that although  his  house  had  been  ransacked,  no  incriminating evidence  had  been  found.  This  was  supported  by  a  Bow  Street  constable who reported that Davidson's 'Hovel' was carefully searched. 21

The five men accused in the Cato Street conspiracy were all sentenced to be hanged early on the morning of 1 May 1820.

The dream of revolution harboured by these desperate men had failed miserably.  Indeed,  the  legend  on  the  banner  (a  black  flag  with  skull  and cross-bones)  which  Davidson  guarded  from  capture  by  the  police  was  a fitting epitaph, 'Let us die like men and not be sold like slaves.' 22

## William Cuffay

Like Wedderburn and Davidson, William Cuffay (called Cuffey, Cuffy and Coffey) stood out among his contemporaries in the English working class movement and was penalised for his activities and political beliefs.

His grandfather, like so many Africans, was a slave on the plantations in St  Kitts.  His  father,  apparently  a  free  man,  brought  the  family  to  Britain when Cuffay was a child. William grew up with his mother and sister.

There  is  uncertainty  as  to  when  Cuffay  first  became  active  in  the working class movement. He 'disapproved of the Trades Union Movement in  1834,  and  was  nearly  the  last  of  his  Society  in  joining  the  lodge'. 23 It must not be presumed however, that this reference to the Owenite Grand National Consolidated Trade Union and Cuffay's hostility to it, extended to trade  unionism  as  such.  In  fact,  Cuffay  went  on  strike  with  his  fellow members. As  a  result  of  this  involvement,  he  lost  a  shop  where  he  had worked for many years, thereafter finding it very difficult to get a job. With the  difficulties  of  unemployment,  the  die  was  cast;  the  direction  already charted.

Cuffay joined the Chartist Movement in 1839 and became prominent in the London leadership. In October 1839 he helped to form the Metropolitan Tailors'  Charter  Association,  which  recruited  80  members  on  the  first

night. 24 He supported the People's Charter, drawn up by the cabinet-maker, William  Lovett,  and  Francis  Place,  demanding  universal  male  suffrage, annual  parliaments,  vote  by  secret  ballot,  payment  of  MPs,  abolition  of property qualifications for MPs, and equal electoral districts.

Cuffay emerged as one of the dozen or so most prominent leaders of the Chartist  movement  in  London.  The  Chartists  in  London  were  essentially artisans.  In  fact,  Chartism  in  London  was,  'a  sustained  movement  which produced its own leaders, stuck to its traditional radicalism yet worked out its own class attitudes'. 25

Within this movement Cuffay's popularity grew. In 1841 he was elected delegate  for  Westminster  to  the  Metropolitan  Delegate  Council. 26 A  few months later, in 1842 when George Julian Harney and other national leaders were arrested, the Council appointed Cuffay, together with Morgan, Dron and Knight to form an 'interim executive.' 27

Cuffay, the tiny tailor, during his Chartist years was always among the most  militant  of  his  contemporaries.  In  the  mid-1840s  he  advocated  the interruption of the middle class Complete Suffrage Meetings and Anti-Corn Law  demonstrations.  As  expected,  the  press  singled  him  out  for  his militancy  and  his  intransigence.  There  was  no  doubt  about  Cuffay's influence  among  London  Chartists.  Indeed, The  Times had  referred  to London Chartists as 'the black man and his party'. 28 This bad press led to Cuffay's wife losing her job as a charwoman. 29 The ruling class had to have their  scapegoat,  but  their  sneering  attacks  could  not  deflect  the  onward march of this black radical leader, who went from strength to strength in his representation  of  an  important  section  of  the  English  working  class.  His stature  was  such  that  by  1844  he  was  a  member  of  the  Masters'  and Servants' Bill Demonstration Committee. 30  In this capacity he was opposed to the power vested in magistrates to imprison a neglectful worker for two months on his employer's oath. To the poor working man this was indeed adding salt to the wound. One of those who fought against the Bill was the radical MP Thomas Slings by Duncombe, who saw it as 'one of the most insidious, oppressive, arbitrary, iniquitous and tyrannical attempts to oppress the working classes. 31 Support of this kind (few and far between) was vital in the working class struggle and needed to be recognised. Cuffay, the  Tailors'  delegate,  was  among  those  who  met  to  arrange  a  soirée  for Duncombe in support of his fight against the Bill.

On other issues  such  as  the  Chartist  Land  Plan,  Cuffay  was  always  a vigorous supporter, representing London at the Manchester Conference in 1845. In essence the Plan was to 'take the unemployed out of the slums and allocate to each family two acres of good arable land'. His life as a Chartist leader was hectic. In 1846 he served as one of three London delegates to the Birmingham  Land  Conference,  and  was  an  auditor  to  the  National  Land Company. He held this position until his arrest. He was also one of the ten directors  of  the  National  Anti-Militia  Association  and  a  member  of  the Democratic Committee for Poland's Regeneration. In 1847, Cuffay was on the Central Registration and Election Committee, and in 1848 he sat on the management Committee for a Metropolitan Democratic Hall. 32

The  year  1848  was  significant  for  Cuffay.  He  was  a  London  Chartist delegate to the National Convention which opened at the Literary Institution  in  Fitzroy  Square,  on  the  morning  of  Tuesday  4  April  1848. Whatever  of  value  Cuffay  might  have  learned  from  past  experience,  he intended to adopt. From the outset he took a hard line. His militancy left no room for flexibility. He was suspicious of opportunists. He questioned G. W.  M.  Reynolds'  standing  as  a  Chartist,  and  totally  opposed  granting credentials to Charles  McCarthy  of  the  Irish  Democratic  Federation. Eventually, the McCarthy dispute was settled.

During  the  Convention,  Cuffay's  militancy  was  in  the  ascendant.  The Convention's  main  concern  was  to  call  a  mass  meeting  on  Kennington Common and a procession that would take the Chartist petition of almost two  million  signatures to the House  of  Commons.  Cuffay  seconded Reynolds' amendment 'That in the event of the rejection of the Petition the Convention  should  declare  its  sitting  permanent  and  should  declare  the Charter the law of the land', 33 and expressed opposition to a body declaring itself permanent that represented only a fraction of the people. However, he directed  the  Convention's  attention  to  presenting  the  petition,  and  that  a National Assembly be called instead. In due course the idea of a National Assembly was accepted.

Cuffay's  militant  stand  at  the  Convention  could  not  accommodate moderation. When the Committee for managing the procession was set up, Cuffay was appointed Chairman.

Significantly,  Cuffay,  the  militant  Chartist  organiser  was  no  hot-head. His  sense  of  responsibility  came  through.  In  the  'crisis',  he  expected

Chartists to act with cool determination. Cuffay was ahead of the Executive which  had  'shrunk  from  their  responsibility'.  Their  lack  of  spirit  did  not inspire confidence in those who would follow them.

The procession was declared illegal by the Commissioner of Police, and the Queen journeyed to the Isle of Wight in search of safety. In defence of their class interests, lawyers, shop-keepers and government clerks, volunteered  as  special  constables.  Seven  thousand  soldiers  were  detailed along the Embankment and 'heavy gun batteries' were deployed. Thousands of police were drafted in to guard the sealed-off bridges. 34 This impressive, intimidating show of force had the desired effect.

The  Commissioner  of  Police  who  interviewed  O'Connor,  the  Irish confederates' leader, said he had never seen a more frightened man. After this interview,  O'Connor  decided,  at  that  advanced  stage,  to  end  the procession.  When  this  decision  reached  the  large  crowd  assembled  at Kennington Common it was met with anger.

At the forefront of those who protested was Cuffay who was opposed to O'Connor and the platform's abandonment of the procession to Parliament. He  recognised  the  stupidity  of  congregating  south  of  the  river,  with  the bridges under complete control of the police and the military, and he spoke in  the  strongest  language  against  O'Connor. 35 He  regarded  the  whole Convention as a set of 'cowardly humbugs' with whom he did not ever wish to be associated. He then left the vehicle he was in and joined the crowd. He told the crowd that O'Connor must have known all this before and that he ought to have informed them of it so they could have taken the petition at once to  the  House  of  Commons,  without  crossing  the  bridges. As  it  was, they were completely trapped. 36

This  defeat  was  a  severe  blow  which  Cuffay  would  not  forgive  or forget. When he was elected as one of the Commissioners to promote the campaign for the Charter following its rejection by Parliament, he saw an uprising as the only way forward. Insurrection being preached by a black man in England was indeed anathema. But, the question arises, was Cuffay the instigator? According to one historian, although Cuffay was secretary of the 'Ulterior Committee' on 16 August, he had only occupied that post since the  13th  of  that  month.  Indeed,  the  'true  leaders'  and  originators  of  the revolutionary attempt were Payne, Mullins, John Rose, Brewster and James Bassett. 37 To the ruling class, Cuffay was clearly a dangerous man. Police

spies kept a close watch on his activities, as they did with the other black radicals Wedderburn and Davidson. Here again, spies found their way into the inner circles of working class organisations. A police spy was actually a member  of  the  seven-strong  'secret'  Committee  that  was  planning  an uprising. A group of 'luminaries' were arrested at the Orange Tree Tavern, Bloomsbury, on 15 August 1848 for allegedly plotting to set fire to 'certain buildings as a signal for the rising.' Seven Dials was to be one of the four stations  from  which  the  outbreak  on  16  August  was  to  be  attempted. 38 Cuffay  was  arrested  the  next  day.  He  refused  to  go  underground  'lest  it should be said that he abandoned his associates in the hour of peril'. 39

Evidence for Cuffay's conviction for waging war against the Queen was given by the police spies: Thomas Powell and George Davis. Cuffay had remained  intransigent  throughout  his  trial  and  made  a  powerful  speech before sentence was pronounced.

Found  guilty,  Cuffay  and  his  fellow  Chartists  were  sentenced  to transportation 'for the term of their natural lives'. The Times in its attempted balanced judgement commented, 'A severe sentence, but a most just one.' 40 The  radical  press,  however,  found  in  this  black  man  steadfastness  and courage.

Cuffay's transportation on the ship Adelaide ,  lasted 103 days. After he landed in Tasmania in November 1849, he was allowed to work as a tailor for wages. 41 Mindful of his earlier experiences of unemployment before he became a political activist, he practised his trade until the last year of his life. Cuffay's working class activities brought him into prominence and in the full public view. He was a larger than life character, who enjoyed great popularity.  So  much  so  that  social  commentators  found  him  interesting, even to the point of distorting his character and contribution to the Chartist movement.

While  the  black  radicals  Wedderburn,  Davidson  and  Cuffay,  among others, (i.e.  Matthew Bogle, Benjamin Prophitt and David Duffey) waged war against  the  English  ruling  class,  the  struggle  of  black  women,  in  the nineteenth century, to achieve self-respect from the degradation of slavery and in displaying unusual loyalty and devotion in the service of the British was exemplified in the lives of Mary Prince and Mary Seacole.

## Mary Prince: slave and 'servant'

Mary  Prince  was  born  a  slave  in  Bermuda  on  a  farm  owned  by  Charles Myners.  Her  mother  was  a  household  slave,  as  was  her  father,  a  sawyer, whose name was Prince.

In this household Mary's violent owner flogged her repeatedly for what he  considered  to  be  her  misdeeds.  Her  mistress  beat  her  too,  not  only instructing Mary in her household tasks, but also impressing upon her the difference between 'the smart of the rope, the cart-whip and the cow-skin'.

Later in her life Mary was sold into the service of Mr and Mrs Wood, where  among  other  tasks  she  had  to  nurse  their  child.  Years  of  work, washing clothes and standing in the water of the salt ponds took their toll and Mary developed rheumatism. By the time she arrived in England with Mr  Wood,  who  had  brought  his  son  to  attend  a  British  school,  her rheumatism had worsened and her body was 'dreadfully swelled'.

Unfortunately for Mary, her increasing disability was met with increasing anger and impatience from the Woods. She was ordered to leave and finally did so, seeking refuge with the Moravian missionaries in Hatton Garden. Given her destitution and her determination to obtain her freedom, Mary went first to the Anti-Slavery office in Aldermanbury towards the end of  November  1828  and  her  case  was  referred  to  George  Stephen  to  be investigated.

In  spite  of  the  Anti-Slavery  Society's  efforts,  Mr  Wood  stubbornly refused to let her go or to return to her husband in the West Indies. This was chattel slavery with a vengeance.  After working for a while as a charwoman,  Mary  finally  went  into  the  service  of  Mr  and  Mrs  Thomas Pringle, where she remained, at least until the time when she related her full story  in The  History  of  Mary  Prince:  A  West  Indian  Slave  Related  by Herself .

According to Pringle, the idea of writing her story was Mary Prince's own suggestion. Throughout her story, a unique view is presented of every facet of the life of a black woman in the service of her oppressors, first as a slave and then, more charitably, as a 'servant'. Indeed, black women were so used to being taken for granted that they were disgraced and, in Mary's words,  'thought  no  more  of  than  beasts'.  Mary's  service  in  England  was both tangible evidence and a reminder of that human debasement. Although

her  master  had  returned  to  the  West  Indies,  he  refused  to  set  Mary  free. Legally, she was still in his service; his property for the rest of her life.

Nothing  more  is  known  of  the  life  of  Mary  Prince.  The  unanswered questions  remain.  Did  she  get  her  freedom  and  return  to  her  husband  in Antigua?  Or  did  she  spend  the  rest  of  her  life  in  England?  Whatever  the answers,  Mary  Prince,  slave  and  'servant'  was  the  historical  precedent  of her sister in service, Mary Seacole.

## Mary Seacole: 'nurse and doctress'

Known as 'mother' to many white soldiers and civilians in many countries, Mary Seacole was born in Jamaica by the turn of the nineteenth century. Her  father  was  a  soldier  of  Scottish  background  and  her  mother,  a  black woman,  kept  a  boarding  house  in  Kingston.  In  her  role  as  'doctress'  her mother achieved high repute among the officers stationed in Kingston. 42

At  an  early  age,  Mary  showed  both  an  independence  of  mind  and  a desire  for  medical  knowledge  and  practice.  After  nursing  dogs  and  cats when she was about 12, she began assisting her mother who attended to the invalid officers and other sick persons who came to the boarding house. As she grew older, she developed a great desire to travel.

One  of  her  impressions  on  her  first  visit  to  England  was  the  vivid recollection  of  London  street-boys  poking  fun  at  her  complexion. After  a year in England, the enterprising Mary returned to Kingston. Soon she was back  again  in  England  for  another  two  years  with  a  large  stock  of  West Indian  preserves  and  pickles  for  sale.  Journeys  to  New  Providence,  Haiti and  Cuba  followed  before  she  was  again  at  her  mother's  side  learning creole medical art. 43

About  this  time,  she  married  a  Mr  Seacole  with  whom  she  had established  a  store.  This  enterprising  experience  would  serve  her  in  good stead later in life. She patiently nursed her husband who was dogged by illhealth. His death, a severe loss to Mary, was followed by the bitter blow of her mother's demise. After this, Mary resolved to take life as it came. When her house was burned down in the great fire of 1843 which swept through Kingston, she set about the practical task of rebuilding.

Like  her  mother,  she  had  gained  a  reputation  as  a  skilful  nurse  and doctress.  The  loneliness  which  might  have  ensued  was  preempted  by  the

continuous presence of invalid officers and their wives. Much knowledge was gained from naval and military surgeons who occasionally worked in her house.

When cholera  swept  Jamaica  in  1850,  Mary  Seacole  gave  invaluable service. Later travels took her to the Isthmus of Panama, Navy Bay, Gatun and up the river Chagres to Gorgona and Cruces. She confessed to having 'a little prejudice' against some Americans. Given that her complexion was a few  shades  of  deeper  brown  which  showed  she  was  related  to  the  black slaves  (a  relationship  she  was  proud  of)  she  asked,  'Is  it  surprising  that  I should  be  somewhat  impatient  of  the  airs  of  superiority  which  many Americans have endeavoured to assume over me?' 44

The  outbreak  of  cholera  at  Cruces  led  to  Mary  Seacole  attending successfully to the sick, thus earning herself the title the 'yellow doctress'. She  tirelessly  braved  the  primitive  conditions  under  which  she  worked. Unfortunately,  she  was  not  immune  and  cholera  attacked  her  overworked body.  Her  high  spirits  and  medical  knowledge  helped  towards  a  quick recovery.  While  at  Cruces,  she  also  had  the  invaluable  experience  of running  a  'hotel'  where  she  served  dinners,  but  had  no  lodgers.  This experience would also serve her well later.

After Cruces, she went to Gorgona before returning to Kingston where she stayed for eight months in 1853. According to Mrs Seacole, that year the ravages of yellow fever nearly exterminated the English in Jamaica. Yet again, she was on hand to administer and comfort the sick and dying. She turned down proposals of marriage from many men of high and low rank, because  her  lasting  love  seemed  to  be  a  yearning  to  travel  and  to  nurse. About that time, war was declared against Russia and in Jamaica news was expected  of  a  'descent  upon  the  Crimea'.  This  news  seemed  to  have affected her little at the time. She returned to Navy Bay, where she opened a store and got caught up in the 'gold fever'.

Each  new  trip  abroad  reinforced  Mary's  confidence  in  her  nursing ability.  In  the  face  of  sickness  and  death,  she  showed  initiative  and  great courage. Indeed, she met many challenges and was now preparing for the ultimate challenge: a longing to join the British Army at Sebastopol. After hearing  the  news  of  war  at  Sebastopol  she  wrote:  'Now,  no  sooner  had  I heard of war somewhere, than I longed to witness it; and when I was told

that many of the regiments I had known so well in Jamaica had left England for the scene of action, the desire to join them became stronger than ever.' 45

Preoccupied with Sebastopol and the Crimea, she arrived in London in the autumn of 1854, soon after the battle of Alma. In London, she devoted herself to a visionary 'new scheme'. With no friends and limited funds, she speculated  on  a  3000-mile  journey  that  would  take  her  to  Balaclava. The fundamental question remained: how would this unknown 'creole' woman persuade the British authorities that she would be useful to the British army in  Sebastopol?  Although  achieving  this  seemed  highly  improbable,  she persisted.

There  had  been  reports of mismanagement,  overcrowding  in  the hospitals, want and suffering in the Crimea. After the Russians had inflicted heavy  casualties,  the  hospitals  needed  disciplined  staff  to  attend  to  the hundreds  of  wounded  and  dying.  This  need  reinforced  Mary  Seacole's resolve to offer her services in the Crimea.

Indeed,  she  did  go  to  the  Crimea,  but  only  after  repeated  rebuffs  and disappointments which reflected her total commitment to the cause. A lesser person might not have made it. Her determination to serve her British 'sons' eventually  took  her  to  the  battlefront,  and  into  history  as  a  'Crimean heroine'.

Mary Seacole, the black nurse, felt she was well fitted for the tasks that awaited her. Indeed, she was 'the right woman in the right place'. Although she  was  well  qualified,  through  her  past  experience,  to  deal  with  the diseases  most  prevalent  in  the  Crimea  (cholera,  diarrhoea  and  dysentery) British officials at the  War  Office  referred  her  to  the  Quartermaster General's department, who in turn, referred her to the Medical Department. The  British  bureaucrats  were  not  convinced.  Colour  had  again  become  a factor.  She  complained that the authorities would not listen to a motherly 'yellow' woman, before changing her plans.

Her  next  scheme  was  to  offer  herself  for  recruitment  as  a  nurse, following Florence Nightingale's departure for the Crimea.  She  was convinced  that  she  was  'one  of  the  very  women  they  most  wanted', possessing the requisite experience and fondness of the work. Enrolment, she  reasoned,  would  be  no  problem.  Here  again,  during  this  period  of waiting,  her  colour  was  clearly  resented.  This  plan  of  going  through  the normal nursing channels also had to be abandoned when she was told that

the  full  complement  of  nurses  had  been  secured.  Following  an  interview with  one  of  Miss  Nightingale's  companions,  Mrs  Seacole  got  the  same negative reply. Disappointed, she wrote: 'I read in her face the fact, that had there been a vacancy, I should not have been chosen to fill it.' 46

In  desperation,  she  applied  to  the  managers  of  the  Crimea  Fund  for information as to whether they would help her to get to the camp, where she hoped something would turn up. Unfortunately, this attempt also failed. She felt  a  sense  of  cruel  disappointment  in  view  of  the  unselfish  motives  in going to the Crimea and the value of her service to the sick soldiers. Indeed, she found it most difficult to convince the authorities of these qualities. In that hopeless predicament she began to have doubts and suspicions as to the possibility  that American  prejudices  against  colour  might  have  had  some root in England. She asked, 'Did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs?'

Clearly,  there  was  no  way  of  making  the  trip  through  British  official agencies. Her only hope was to get to the Crimea at her own expense, on her own initiative. She took comfort in the fact that some of those she had cared for (and doctors she had worked with) in Jamaica, were there. They would vouch for her skill and experience, she reasoned. Rejected as a nurse by  British  officialdom  (at  a  time  when  the  nursing  profession  was  an occupation for the well-to-do classes) she entertained the idea of opening a hotel for invalids in the Crimea to be run in her own way. She acted upon her decision by printing cards which read:

## BRITISH HOTEL

Mrs Mary Seacole

( late of Kingston, Jamaica )

Respectfully announces to her former kind friends, and to the Officers of the Army and Navy generally

That  she  has  taken  her  passage  in  the  steamer Hollander ,  to  start from  London  on  the  25th  of  January,  intending  on  her  arrival  at Balaclava to establish a mess-table and comfortable quarters for the sick and convalescent officers. 47

While still preparing to leave England Mrs Seacole met again a Mr Day who  was  travelling  to  Balaclava  to  attend  to  some  shipping  business.

Together, they decided to open a store as well as a hotel near the camp. She emphasised,  however,  that  'These  new  arrangements  were  not  allowed  to interfere  in  any  way  with  the  main  object  of  my  journey.'  In  fact,  in anticipation,  most  of  her  limited  funds  were  invested  in  medicines  which she believed would be useful. How thoughtful. Still with the British soldier in mind, she used the remaining money to buy 'those home comforts' which would be difficult to get outside England.

Finally,  she  left  England  on  the Hollander , passing  through  Malta, Gibraltar and Constantinople, before visiting the Scutari hospital. On a tour of  the  wards,  she  was  greeted  with  shouts  of  'Mother  Seacole!  Mother Seacole!'  by  an  Irish  sergeant  she  had  known  in  Kingston.  She  sat  at  his bedside  and  tried  to  cheer  him  up  and,  at  the  risk  of  offending  hospital officials, she gave a helping hand. The suffering at the hospital was unlike anything she had ever seen. 'But if it is so here', she wrote, 'what must it not be at the scene of war … I must be useful three or four days nearer to their  pressing  wants  than  this.' 48 Thus,  she  was  ready  for  the  greatest challenge of her life.

On this journey she carried a letter of introduction from a doctor ('Dr F -')  to  Miss  Nightingale.  To  one  of  Miss  Nightingale's  assistants,  Mrs Seacole  was  more  of  an  object  of  'curiosity  and  surprise'  than  a  deeply committed  volunteer  for service.  Assuming  that Mrs  Seacole  sought employment at Scutari, this assistant kindly told her that Miss Nightingale already had the entire management of the hospital staff and that there was no  vacancy.  When  Mrs  Seacole  interrupted  her  by  saying  that  she  was bound  for  the  battlefront  in  a  few  days,  the  assistant  was  left  even  more surprised.

About half an hour later, Mary Seacole met Florence Nightingale. This is how she described the English nurse who would achieve world renown:

A slight figure, in nurses' dress, with a pale, gentle, and withal firm face, resting lightly in the palm of one white hand, while the other supports  the  elbow  -  a  position  which  gives  to  her  countenance  a keen inquiring expression which is rather marked. Standing thus in repose and yet keenly observant - the greatest sign of impatience at any  time  a  slight,  perhaps  unwitting  motion  of  the  firmly  planted right foot - was Florence Nightingale. 49

After reading Mrs Seacole's letter of introduction, Miss Nightingale in a gentle,  practical  and  businesslike  way  asked,  'What  do  you  want,  Mrs Seacole - anything that we can do for you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy.' 50

Although  overcrowding  in  the  Scutari  hospital  presented  a  problem, Mrs  Seacole  was  able  to find a bed  for the night in the hospital washerwoman's quarters, before resuming her journey on the Hollander to Balaclava. The six weeks she spent at Balaclava were 'rough'. Nevertheless, with permission from the authorities, she set up a store and gave  English  language  lessons  to  a  Turkish  Pasha.  Mrs  Seacole's  British Hotel,  never  fully  completed  (indeed  a  year  later,  it  still  needed  shutters) gained a great reputation.

The  written  records  of  many  testify  to  Mary  Seacole's  work  in  the Crimea. Given the comments of those well-placed to make a judgement, it is  clear  that  she  had  achieved the goal of serving as camp doctress, nurse and  'mother'.  Her  natural  concern,  which  seemed  boundless,  facilitated flexibility  in  activity  demanded  by  the  war.  Not  surprisingly,  her  many patients  turned  to  her  firstly,  because  these  men  had  serious  objection  to going into hospital (except in urgent cases) and secondly, because they were able  to  get  the  'sick-comforts'  and  nourishing  food  available  at  Mrs Seacole's  store.  An  additional  reason  why  many  came  to  Mrs  Seacole's British Hotel for medical treatment was, in her own words, because she was 'very  familiar  with  the  diseases  which  they  suffered  most  from  and successful in their treatment'.

After Sebastopol was taken, she wrote, 'the great work was accomplished'. Indeed, her great struggle to get there was also accomplished in the teeth of 'official indifference, hauteur and prejudice'. It was for her, a great triumph, a moment to savour.

Mrs Seacole returned to England and worked for a while in Aldershot. The acclaim she received subsequently was a well-deserved bonus. Financially,  however,  she  was  in  a  precarious  position,  for  some  time.  In fact,  she  was  ready  to  'journey  to  any  place'  in  search  of  employment. Although poor, she was proud of the service she had given for others.

In England, she reflected on the results of her Crimean campaign: she was in poor health, bankrupt and unemployed. What, in fact, Mary Seacole had gained was friendship, particularly from those she had met before and

after  Sebastopol.  In  London,  she  enjoyed  being  recognised.  She  derived great pleasure and satisfaction, having achieved her goal of getting to the Crimea and back, through her stubbornness to serve the cause of Britain, in keeping with the legacy of her Jamaican past.

Nevertheless,  the  'Crimean  heroine'  was  poor  and  unemployed.  In recompense  for  her  'charities  and  incessant  labours'  among  the Army,  as she  put  it,  a  number  of  'noblemen  and  gentlemen'  who  knew  her  in  the Crimea had set up a Committee to aid her. Yet in spite of the courage and the indomitable spirit displayed by this extraordinary woman in the service of  Britain,  sadly,  one  can't  help  recalling  the  problems  which  confronted British charities some seventy-five years earlier, in assisting the black poor in London.

Some,  however,  remembered  and  stood  by  her.  For  Mrs  Seacole's benefit,  a  friend,  Lord  Rokeby,  to  whom  her  book  was  dedicated,  among other well-to-do friends, organised a four-day musical festival at the Surrey Gardens,  with  one  thousand  performers,  nine  military  bands  and  an orchestra. At this event, Mary Seacole took 'pride of place', seated in the front  of  the  gallery  flanked  by  Lord  Rokeby  and  Lord  George  Paget. Unfortunately,  this  massive  effort  raised  only  £228  for  Mrs  Seacole. 51 Although she never realised a fortune, her fame was unquestioned. Cheers greeted her wherever she went and publication of her autobiography, The Wonderful Adventures of Mary Seacole in Many Lands , helped to maintain her popularity.

After  1857,  she  spent  most  of  the  rest  of  her  life  in  England  and continued  to  enjoy  the  friendship  of  members  of  the  English  aristocracy. Indeed, Queen Victoria's kinsman, Count Gleichen, the sculptor, did a small bust of her; and Lord Rokeby and his daughter were all remembered in her will.  When  the  firm  of  Day  and  Seacole  was  wound  up,  Mary  Seacole needed all the financial help she could get. While little is known of how she recouped her fortunes, she left over £2600 when she died on 14 May 1881.

After her death, she seemed to have been 'totally forgotten' in England. By  chance,  her  grave  was  recently  discovered  in  a  'complete  state  of disrepair, stones cracked and crumbling, headstone with mildew and dirt'. Efforts were undertaken to restore the headstone by the Lignum Vitae Club (an association of Jamaican women in London) and the British Commonwealth Nurses War Memorial Fund.

If the 'yellow doctress' was forgotten in England, she was remembered in Jamaica, where the Nurses Association of Jamaica Headquarters was renamed  'Mary  Seacole  House'.  For  the  Association,  Mrs  Seacole  has remained a source of great inspiration. Recently, a reconsecration ceremony was held at her graveside in London. In accordance with her wish, she was buried 'in the Catholic portion of the cemetery at Kensal Green, London'. The  restored  headstone  read:  'Here  lies  Mary  Seacole  (1805-1881)  of Kingston, Jamaica, a notable nurse who cared for the sick and wounded in the  West  Indies,  Panama  and  on  the  battlefields  of  the  Crimea,  18541856.' 52

Mary Seacole was an outstanding nineteenth-century example of a black woman  from  the  Caribbean  who,  through  service  in  the  imperial  cause, found her way from the colonial periphery to the metropolitan centre. While her struggle reflected the oppression of women generally in the nineteenth century,  she  was  the  precursor  of  an  exodus  of  Florence  Nightingaleoriented black nurses who came to serve Britain in the twentieth century, only to realise the harsh reality of race and colour prejudice.

## The Indian diaspora: 'a new system of slavery'

The abolition of the slave trade did not end slavery on the plantations. In the British sugar colonies, sugar and servitude remained tied together, dictating the economic, political and social structure.

In the aftermath of full Emancipation of the slaves in 1838, the labour vacuum on the plantations was filled by East Indian indentured labour. In Mauritius,  one  of  the  most  oppressive  territories  during  the  period  of Apprenticeship  (which  came  on  1  February  1835,  later than in the Caribbean) it was estimated that as many as one-seventh of the slaves were from South India. 1 Not surprisingly therefore, Mauritius planters turned to India for their  plantation  labour  force.  In  1840  Mauritius  received  18,000 Indian labourers.  The West Indian sugar islands, with no immediate supply 2 of labour, went through a period of decay. Pressure from the planters was

mounted to get the British government to induce East Indians to labour for deplorably  low  wages.  Thus,  'Negro'  slavery  in  the  Caribbean  and  the Mascarenes  was  replaced  by  a  'new  system  of  slavery'  -  East  Indian indentured labour.

The  actual  functioning  of  the  institution  of  slavery  and  of  indentured labour and other forms of bondage which followed can only be understood by reference to the plantation products, and by some account of how this form of production evolved. Given the opening up of the New World and the  acquisition  of  tropical  colonies  by  the  warring  European  powers,  and the  high  priority  given  to  the  cultivation  of  tropical  products  in  the metropolis, a new unit of production, the plantation, emerged.

During  the  eighteenth  century,  until  the  end  of  the  Napoleonic  wars, British West Indian sugar enjoyed a preference against the tariff on foreign sugar and sugar from elsewhere in the British Empire. With the capture and occupation  of  Trinidad  and  Demerara  (British  Guiana)  new  competitors within  the  British  monopoly  were  accepted.  By  1830,  there  had  been  a change  in  the  relative  importance  of  the  sugar  producing  colonies.  For example, that year, Jamaica exported only 68,962 tons (having exported a record  99,600  tons  in  1805),  Trinidad's  total  was  10,244  tons,  British Guiana produced 59,790 tons and Mauritius 32,750 tons. Further, the new undeveloped  colonies  surged  ahead.  In  1840,  Mauritius  exported  36,559 tons  with  British  Guiana  35,619  tons,  Jamaica  slipped  further  down  with 26,453 tons and Trinidad 12,258 tons. 3

During the 1840s, the free trade campaign led to a lowering of tariffs protecting  British  and  British  colonial  produce  in  line  with  the  duties  on foreign  imports.   Given  the  hard  times  which  hit  the  British  West  Indian 4 plantations between 1840 and 1950, the English capitalists were faced with the challenge of producing a larger volume of sugar at cheaper prices. To do this, given the state of technology, cheap labour was the only way possible. Thus, Mauritius, in close proximity to the Indian labour market was able to increase  its  exports.  In  1855  the  area  under  sugar  production  was  81,000 acres,  rising  to  122,000  acres  ten  years  later.  While  production  in  British Guiana and Jamaica had levelled out, Trinidad's output increased steadily. Mauritius, however, was the principal British sugar producer, dramatically increasing  its  exports  from  55,163  tons  in  1850  to  134,048  tons  in  1860. Five years later, a record crop of 165,000 tons was achieved. 5

Given the changes in the sugar industry in the various islands, in terms of the mode of production, little had changed in Mauritius since the days of slavery.  As the ruling power in the Empire, Britain owned and controlled 6 production in the tropical territories. And although free trade was substituted for mercantilist monopoly  between  the  1840s  and  1860s, colonial dependency on Britain was much the same. While some colonies experienced a degree of prosperity such as Burma (and to a lesser extent Ceylon  and  Malaya)  British  economic  policies  and  practices  had  adverse effects upon other colonies. Thus, India succeeded Africa in providing the insatiable capitalist demand  for  cheap  and  disposable  labour  on  the plantations and mines to maintain the British/colonial relationship.

Because  most  of  India's  population,  an  estimated  80  per  cent,  were engaged in agriculture and because of the instability of the rural economy, due  to  the  loss  of  land  of  peasant  farmers  falling  into  debt,  or  through illness, many found themselves landless labourers. Predictably, there was a desperate drift that took on added significance in times of famine, flood or invasion.  Consequently,  a  large  pool  of  floating,  casual  labour  was  to  be found in India's large cities.

Towards the end of the eighteenth century there were Indian labourers in the ports of south-east Asia. In fact, the East India Company's attempt to establish a trading station in lower Burma on Negrais Island in 1753-9 was dependent  on  Indian  labour.  When  the  settlement  was  withdrawn,  the families of the 'Coolies' sent to Negrais complained that the 'Head Cooly' was paid 'what money those who died there left behind them'. 7

Labouring far from home was an acceptable part of the reality of life for thousands  of  poor  Indian  families,  perhaps  because  such  employment, usually short-term, allowed a return to their homes. However, different and disturbing  patterns  began  to  emerge  with  the  export  of  Indians  further afield. Forced banishment killed hopes of a return home. In addition to the domestic slavery prevalent in India during the eighteenth century, there was a trade in slaves to supply the sugar plantations of the Mascarenes. South Indian  slaves  from  Kerala  were  taken  by  the  Dutch  to  Mauritius.  By  the latter part of the eighteenth century (in spite of the proclamation in 1789 by the Governor-General, Lord Cornwallis, prohibiting the export of people as slaves to different parts of India and beyond) slaves were regularly sold to French  planters  in  Mauritius  and  Reunion.  Kidnapping  men,  women  and

children was part of that trade. There were some 6000 Indian slaves in 1800 on  the  Mauritian  estates,  with  thousands  of  enslaved  Indians  in  Reunion where  slavery  was  not  abolished  until  1848.   Moreover,  convicts  were 8 transported to Mauritius in 1815 at the request of Governor Farquhar.

In spite of the Hindu  objection to crossing the 'Black Water', emigration  was  already  regarded  as  a  natural  progression  in  the  early nineteenth century. Among  those  lured to servile labour abroad (to Mauritius and British Guiana) were the Dhangars or Hill Coolies, who were regarded as good workmen and preferred by the planters. During the 1840s and 1850s they formed a substantial number of those taken abroad under the indentureship  system.  From  the  1850s,  however,  their  proportion dwindled. It was estimated that from two-fifths to one-half of the emigrants were Dhangars. 9

Travelling to Mauritius was in itself, a formidable proposition. But that long hazardous journey to the West Indies was another matter. During the 1850s,  the  mortality  rates  on  voyages  to  the  West  Indies  reached  an appalling  level.  Apart  from  the  incidental  humanitarian  concern,  at  this time, in the reckoning of the capitalist log-book, the loss of a quarter or a third of the cargo of coolies was 'a major commercial loss' on the voyage. And  interestingly,  the  'better  workmen',  the  Hill  Coolies,  were  at  the greatest  risk.  The  death  rate  among  them  was  considerably  higher  than among the plains people. Significantly during the long sea voyages, suicide was a common form of death.

Apart from the sugar colonies, from the 1860s, the tea industry began to make labour  demands. With  the  drying  up  of  the  supply  of  Hill  Coolies, demands were made on the 'flotsam of humanity' in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.  Most  of  these  simple  country  people  were  herded  towards  the Emigration Agent's  depot  where  their  muscles  and  hands  were  examined for  the  rigours  of  manual  labour.  Despite  these  checks  (were  they  mere formality?)  the  most  'outlandish'  emigrants  were  taken  aboard  to  fill  the ships, which was clearly the object of the exercise.

Calcutta was the main port of embarkation during the first 30-40 years of organised emigration until about 1870. Labourers were drawn particularly  from  Banaras  Province  and  Bihar  where,  as  the  people  at  the bottom end of society, they were economically and socially inferior. These low-caste people were at the mercy of the superior castes. In effect, many

were, as in Bihar, in a state of semi-slavery known as Kamiuti , by which the poor  people  sold  their  services,  and  sometimes  those  of  their  children  in years  to  come,  in  order  to  meet  their  pressing  needs.  These  people  were most vulnerable to the recruiters of indentured labour. 10

Among the early emigrants, many were from what was then known as the Western Districts of British India: those between Banaras and Allahabad. A  major  push  factor,  the  'awful  famine'  of  the  early  1840s  in Upper  India  resulted  in  a  mass  exodus,  first  to  Bihar,  where  they  were 'persuaded  to  embark'.  To  this  point,  people  came  from  as  far  as  Delhi. Also, during the 1840s, emigration built up at Madras and in Bombay.

Overall,  the  main  movement of indentured emigration occurred in the years  before  1880.  By  1871,  Mauritius  had  a  population  composed  of 216,258 Indians and 99,784 Creoles, mainly of African descent. Thereafter, as fewer went to Mauritius, the flow was deflected to fill a steady demand in the Caribbean,  with  growing  numbers  going  to  Natal  during  the remaining  years  of  the  nineteenth  century. 11 Emigration  from  Madras expanded  during  the  1870s  to  satisfy  the  growing  demands  of  Ceylon, Burma, Mauritius, the Straits Settlements, Natal and the Caribbean.

By 1900,  British  Guiana  had  a  larger  Indian  population  than  Malaya. The Malayan rubber boom, however, siphoned-off a considerable number of the labourers from Madras to the rubber estates. Moreover, Fiji became a significant importer of Indian labour. While Madras also supplied the heavy demand in Natal, emigration from Calcutta continued.

Towards  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the  Indian  diaspora  had stretched far and wide as the planters' demand for labour was satisfied. In the  West  Indies,  St  Lucia,  St  Kitts,  Grenada,  St  Vincent,  Martinique, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and British Guiana all called on Indian labour. Further, Fiji, the Straits Settlements, Burma,  Malaya, Mauritius,  Ceylon  and  Reunion  had  large  infusions  of  labourers.  And  in South Africa, they went to Natal and Durban. In East Africa, they went to Kenya and were called upon to build the Uganda Railway.

According to one estimate 525,482 Indians emigrated under indenture to  French  and  British  sugar  colonies  between  1842  and  1870.  Of  these, 351,401  went  to  Mauritius,  76,691  to  British  Guiana  and  42,519  to Trinidad,  with  15,169  to  Jamaica.  Natal  received  6,448  and  Reunion imported 15,005; both these importations were between 1860 and 1870. The

other  French  colonies  took  16,341  Indians  in  the  same  decade.  One calculation made in 1869 showed that immigration from India during 184367 amounted to 1,446,407 of whom 89,897 returned to India. An estimated 250,000  had  settled in Ceylon  (now  Sri  Lanka),  while  the  350,000 unaccounted  for  were  presumed  dead.  Overall  then,  between  one  to  two million  Indian  labourers  went  overseas  to  the  tropical  plantations  during 1830-70. 12

Although the Anti-Slavery Society had expressed its concern in 1872, there was general complacency in Britain, but eventually protest against the system,  undertaken  during  a  very  long  period  of  questioning,  was  to overcome  even  the  massive  inertia  of  the  Government  of  India.  Many aspects  of  the  system  aroused  concern,  but  always  much  too  slowly.  The deadly diseases (cholera, typhoid and dysentery, among others) plagued the indentured  labourers.  The  passage  over  the  menacing  oceans  on  sailing ships  was  a  difficult  ordeal  for  passengers  and  crew.  Those  who  arrived alive at the end of their journeys, were both shattered and strengthened.

Having  suffered  a  tortuous  passage  to  the  plantations,  for  various reasons,  only  between  one-third  and  one-quarter  of  the  emigrants  to  the distant  colonies  ever  returned.  Basically,  the  right  of  a  return  passage  to Indians  was  only  reluctantly  conceded  by  the  colonial  authorities.  In Mauritius, for example, this was granted only to the 'indigent, the sick and the misfits'. Underlying this return was the fact that those who did so were 'either the defeated, or the winners, either poor or rich'.

Apart from the rich and poor groupings among the returnees, there was another category of Indians from the diaspora who came back on holiday. The  children  of  indentured  Indians,  having  traced  their  ancestral  village, were shocked to find that their parents were only vaguely remembered or in some  cases  forgotten  in  caste-ridden  India.  The  effect  on  these  secondgeneration Indians during their genealogical visit to the Motherland was to lead  to  a  preferable,  hasty  retreat  back  to  the  familiar  colonies! Although some Indians returned to India with a spirit of independence, they were the exceptions. While generations of human beings had laboured and died, the old  slave  plantation  system  had  remained  largely  unchanged  since  the eighteenth century. Into the twentieth century, work on the sugar estates was still  a  gruelling experience as it was intended to be (closely monitored by the  watchful  eyes  of  the  Protectors  and  Magistrates  of  the  estates  who identified with the interests of the planters); the Indian indentured labourers

were monitored and exploited to the hilt. Under this extremely oppressive regime, they laboured throughout their terms of indenture for a pittance.

That  some  survived  this  ordeal  was  due  largely  to  their  resilience,  or closer to the truth was the fact that they had no alternative. They relied on a community  spirit:  organising  a  social  life  in  relation  to  the  'lost  India'. Thus, their festivals and feasts were crucial safety valves which aided their survival.  But  these  were  occasional  moments  of  cultural  release.  Their grinding  poverty  and  the  constant  demands  on  their  labour,  were  ever present. As sickness and premature death took their toll, many resorted to drunkenness to temper the boredom and emptiness of their lives. In effect, they  were  lost  and  a  long,  long  way  from  home.  The  feeling  of  betrayal among them was strong. According to descendants of indentured labourers in  Trinidad,  'They  had  spent  their  first  year  in  Trinidad  'crying'  as  they remembered their homes and realised how badly they had been 'tricked'.' 13 This story had echoes elsewhere, such as in the Straits Settlements.

On the estates, the 'task' was the assignment with which newcomers had to  come  to  terms.  Not  only  was  it  an  'un-Indian'  way  of  working,  it  was grossly unfair in that newcomers who failed to complete their assignments forfeited any payment for the day's work. Thus, the labourer was liable to the daily imposition of maximum hours of work. Moreover, the strong were played off against the weak. For example, a task might require a 15-hour working day for the weaker or less experienced coolies, while a stronger, more capable worker could do it in about half the time.

Like the slaves before them, the coolies ('a compulsory labour force') had to be kept by their employers. Thus, the indentured labourer in earning his keep became the 'all-purpose work animal' as the primitive system of manual labour took precedence over the more extended use of implements worked by steam machinery or by animal (mules and oxen) power. Given the wear and tear of the system, generally, the coolies were either at work, in  hospital  or,  more  often  than  not,  in  gaol.  Few  were  free  of  either  the threat, or the actual fact, of some form of punishment. This attitude towards them  as  convicts  was  a  mark  of  their  bondage  under  the  plantation indentured labour system.

To maintain obedience to the demands of the plantations, flogging was a common form of discipline. Planters were all powerful; some taking the law into their hands. As one of them put it, 'Every man is a magistrate on his own estate, you know, and therefore as long as the man is working for you,

you have a right to do what you like with him - that is, anything short of killing him.' 14 Indeed only just 'short of killing him' was a clear statement of the treatment meted out to the Indian coolies. According to the Mauritius Royal  Commission,  during  the  period  1867-72,  50  Indians  had  died  of rupture of the spleen as a result of severe beatings. There was no record of punishment of those responsible.

Given all the atrocities committed by planters and their managers, there were  few  official  comments  either  in  India,  in  Britain  or  in  the  colonies. Indeed,  it  was  the  Sanderson  Committee  which  drew  attention  to  the alarming  number  of  convictions  of  indentured  labourers  in  the  sugar colonies. Was this passive disobedience in the face of planters' oppression and exploitation? Or was it a wilful act on the part of the employer to instil obedience  through  fear  into  an  already  'docile'  and  'submissive'  labour force? Given the abuses of the system, the Sanderson Committee underlined the various labour codes applying to both indentured and 'free' Indians.

The stereotype image of the vagrant Indian labourer was reinforced in colonial reports. As it was, the system which brought them to the colonies as workers now condemned them as vagrants. In 1878, there were 20,000 vagrants in Mauritius, and predictably, a 'Vagrancy Committee' was set up. Most interestingly, however, if a time-expired indentured labourer refused employment (as a 'free' man) he was classed as a vagrant. And if he was still without registered employment after three months, he was regarded as an 'incorrigible vagrant'. Hemmed in from all sides, a considerable number of  Indians  who  should  have  been  hospitalised  or  receiving  medical  care were  woefully  neglected,  and  left  to  die  and  end  their  indentureship prematurely.

Taken together, disease, bad housing, lack of medical attention and care, and  malnutrition  contributed  to  suicide.  In  1871,  Sir  Arthur  Gordon,  the Governor  of  Mauritius,  commenting  on  the  'extraordinary  frequency  of suicides  among  Indian  immigrants'  in  the  colony,  attributed  this  partly  to the  shortage  of  women.  He  added  however  'I  myself  believe  that  a  very large proportion of the suicides are due to nostalgia or an intense desire to return to India which they have no means of gratifying.' 15 As a result of the agitation  of  Indian  Nationalist,  Dadabhai  Naoroji,  officials  began  to  take notice of the suicide statistics. In fact, the indentured labourers' lives were

monotonous and unattractive; indeed, many had quarrelled over the lack of women in their communities.

As in slavery, under indentureship, marriage or 'companionage' was an unstable relationship. Although a wife was a status symbol (of security and prosperity), the low-status poor man was liable to have his wife taken away by a man of superior status. This dearth of women aroused much concern and comment. In fact, disputes over women constituted the main cause of murders and suicides.

In addition to the hostility which surrounded them, Indian labourers also had to contend with the rising antagonism of the Creole Blacks, on and off the plantations.

The  ex-slaves  were  conscious  of  the  Indians  as  labour  which  was replacing them on the plantations. Indeed, Indians were used by planters as strike-breakers in Jamaica and other West Indian islands. Soon, both Indians and Creoles developed stereotyped views referring to each other as 'nigger' and 'coolie'. In colonies where the Indians were a small minority they were 'Creolised'. And where they complemented Creole Blacks economically, as in  Trinidad,  they  achieved  a  partnership.  A  major  point  of  contention between the two groups, however, was Indian immigration. In fact, as early as 1857, Blacks in Jamaica encouraged by Baptist missionaries, petitioned against Indian immigration. In 1866, there were strikes by native labourers for  higher  wages. It  was  argued that without the reserve supply of Indian labour,  employers  would  have  been  compelled  to  raise  wages  by  25  per cent. 16

In spite of the antagonism between Creole Blacks and the Indians, some integration  and  intermarriage  had  taken  place,  particularly  in  the  smaller islands.  In  general,  however,  the  Blacks  did  not  allow  them  into  their community. This was especially marked in the French colonies. 17 To Blacks in the West Indies, the Indians were 'Coolie Slaves'. 18 It seemed the Indians were  almost  always  stigmatised  as  the  dregs  of  their  country:  'low-born, even criminal'. 19

Through all this, they showed an almost limitless patience and capacity to suffer. Although it seemed the Indians were pacified by small concessions, this approach was balanced by the severe punishment meted out  to  'ringleaders'  by  the  Immigration  Department.  Moreover,  reflecting their total subservience, 'It was an absolute principle of the system that no

Indian  labourer  should  ever  acquire  a  recognised  position  as  a  leader  or even as a negotiator. Their only recognised role was that of petitioners: and humble petitioners too.' 20

But  such  revolts  as  there  were,  were  'sad  and  sordid'  as  in  1869  in British Guiana. In 1903 there was, in the always highly charged atmosphere of  British  Guiana,  a  wave  of  strikes,  and  in  Surinam  there  was  industrial unrest where an attempt by Dutch troops to arrest the Indians resulted in 13 dead and 40 wounded.

It has been argued that the rise of protest in the Caribbean reflected the fact that the Indians were becoming conscious of their rights. On the other hand, the absence of mass protest in Mauritius, Ceylon, Malaya and Natal (prior  to  Gandhi's  efforts)  is  evidence  of  successful  organisation  in  these territories. Together, these protests demonstrated the potential solidarity of the Indians. The one factor which gave the 'coolies' an advantage over the slaves  was  that  one  day  their  'slavery'  would  be  ended.  It  was  this expectation, not escape or revolt, which generated hope by the close of the nineteenth century.

Thus, in response to the global demands of British capitalism, an Indian diaspora  had  come  into  being  and  settled  (albeit  uneasily)  next  to  the African diaspora. Capital's advantage in creating and widening schisms and divisions between these two major colonial labour groups, would become a major manipulative weapon during the twentieth century. Already, however, the questions of race and colour, on which colonial exploitation was based, were uppermost in the minds of both African and Indian nationalists. The black  intelligentsia  from  both  the  African  and  Indian  diaspora  would continue  to  challenge  the  questions  of  race  and  colour,  and  demand  the fundamental right of self-government.

## Pan Africanism: origins and early development

Given the deep roots of the Pan African tradition, a pre-history which could be  dated  back  to  Cugoano  and  Equiano  in  the  eighteenth  century,  it  was only  in  the  nineteenth  century  that  the  Pan  African  idea  put  forward  by Delany  and  Edward  Blyden,  achieved  some  clarity  and  form  in  Britain when the African Association came into being on 24 September 1897 with Henry Sylvester Williams as honorary secretary. 21 This was merged into the

new  Pan African Association  following  the  first  Pan African  Conference called  in  London in 1900. Williams was the moving light behind the Pan African  Association  and  the  brain  behind  the  Pan  African  Conference. Preceding  him  were  Celestine  Edwards  and  J.  A.  Thorne.  Apart  from Blyden's pioneering work, the efforts of both men had an important bearing on these formations in support of the 'Black Race'.

## Celestine Edwards

Celestine Edwards was born in Dominica in 1857. Having there developed 'burning convictions', namely the truth of fundamentalist Christianity, the cause of temperance and a strong belief in human rights and brotherhood, 22 Edwards  came  to  live  in  Britain.  The  date  of  his  arrival  cannot  be ascertained.  It  is  clear,  however,  that  he  lived  with  his  cousin  William  in Edinburgh where he became active in the temperance movement. He then moved  to  Sunderland  before  settling  in  the  East  End  of  London  about 1880. 23

He was proud of his blackness and showed a dedication to the theme of Black self-betterment throughout his life. In fact, he distinguished himself by being the first Black man to become an editor in Britain, preceding such Pan Africanists as Sylvester Williams, Duse Mohamed Ali and John Eldred Taylor.  He  edited  the  magazines Lux and Fraternity ,  which  reflected  his political commitment to a Pan African press.

Edwards had heralded a long list of remarkable Blacks in Britain who contributed to the Pan African movement, but who are less well-known than their twentieth century successors, namely  C. L. R. James, George Padmore, Ras Makonnen, Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta and Wallace Johnson,  among  others.  One  such  Pan  Africanist  of  note,  during  the nineteenth century, was J. A. Thorne.

## J. A. Thorne: the 'preliminary stage' 1894-7

In  the  'preliminary  stage'  of  Pan  Africanism,  J.  Albert  Thorne  played  a central  role  in  Britain. As  a  'descendant  of Africa  and  Barbados'  he  had hoped eventually to establish a colony of one hundred West Indian families on the banks of the Zambezi. His African Colonial Enterprise provides an important  focus  in  the  development  of  Pan  African  nationalism.  Indeed, Thorne  is  (and  must  be)  regarded  as  a  precursor  of  Marcus  Garvey.  His repatriation  scheme  and  general  philosophy  in  relation  to  Africa  'would

have  been  most  likely  to  have  fertilised  the  embryo  of  Marcus  Garvey's racial nationalism'. 24

Thorne was born in Barbados on 2 May 1860, the last of 13 children born to George and Jane Thorne. Albert was one of the five children who survived smallpox and cholera. His father rose from labourer to become a highly  respected  small  landowner  and  also  a  devoted  member  of  the Anglican  Church.  Thus,  hard  work  and  a  religious  upbringing  had  a powerful influence on young Albert, who did exceptionally well at school and  served  as  a  pupil-teacher  from  November  1873  to  December  1876. Having made considerable progress he became disenchanted with his career as a teacher. If he had the choice, he would have preferred being a printer. It was clear, however, that he had a great respect for scholarship.

In  1879,  when  he  was  19,  he  arrived  in  British  Guiana  and  after enrolling for a course at the Colonial Hospital, he received a diploma as a principal  dispenser  and  dresser.  He  also  did  missionary  work  for  the Moravians  in  Demerara.  Soon  after  his  brother,  who  ran  a  respectable druggist establishment in Georgetown, had left for Scotland, Albert returned to Barbados. In 1884 he arrived in England.

After making 'a host of friends', some of whom were in high positions, Thorne was impressed by the force of commitment of 'these good people' to the moral advancement of their own race. Thus, he set out to work for 'the temporal and spiritual advancement of our race'. 25

He  registered  as  a  medical  student  at  the  University  of  Aberdeen  in Scotland on 31 October 1887 and graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery on 28 October 1893. Later, he recalled that it  was  about  two  or  three  years  before  his  graduation  that  the  plan  of African colonisation was conceived. According to Robert Hill, it was highly likely  that  Thorne  was  influenced  to  some  degree  by  Edward  Wilmot Blyden's  work, Christianity,  Islam  and  the  Negro  Race , a  fundamental theme of which was 'African colonisation'.

About this time, Thorne met Dr James Johnston (the Scottish missionary) who had arrived in England between February and April 1891, with  a  party  of  six  Jamaican  missionary  assistants  on  their  way  to  South Central Africa.  In  spite  of  Thorne's  argument  that  his  plan  was  'a  purely original  experiment',  Robert  Hill  stated  that  Thorne  could  probably  have

been influenced by the pioneering work of Dr Johnston between 1891 and 1892.

The  years  between  1891  and  1893  were  crucial  to  British  colonial consolidation in Central Africa. In the scramble for African territory, Thorne felt  West  Indians  should  stake  their  claim.  The  Rev  Fergus  Ferguson  of Glasgow wrote that Thorne might become 'the Moses of our day to lead his people back to the land of promise'. Unfortunately, Thorne's promising plan was beset by problems. For instance, the African Sub-Committee made it clear that 'he  would  be  shut  out  from  intervening  in  the  sphere  of missionary operations on the Zambesi'. His idea of an African fatherland and  of  'a  great  movement  of  enterprise'  was  what  ultimately  Marcus Garvey was to realise, but it should be clear that 'the seed was planted and watered quite some time before it came to fruition in the Universal Negro Improvement Association'. 26

Thorne's  scheme  to  take  West  Indian  settlers  to  his  African  Zion received  a  decisive  setback  from  which  it  did  not  recover.  Following  an editorial in the Jamaica Daily Gleaner on 13 March 1897 entitled 'The Fall of Dr Thorne', the members of Thorne's Preliminary Committee 'resolved to withdraw entirely from the scheme'. This action by the Committee dealt a  severe  blow  to  the  chances  of  success  of  Thorne's  scheme.  Further,  an attempt was made to discredit Thorne's personal character. In the muckraking  which  ensued  his  alleged  marriage  was  seen  as  a  means  to financial  gain,  and Truth , published  in  London,  stated  'Not  only  is  it extremely doubtful whether any nigger will be better off in the land of his ancestors than in the West Indies but the fitness of the Ethiopian Moses to lead this exodus  is open  to considerable question.' 27 Following  the acrimony,  the  only  support  Thorne  received  came  from  the Illustrated Missionary News .

Given these problems, Thorne's plan to select ten 'pioneer settlers' and gather whatever support he could obtain in the West Indies in order to take them  to the Zambezi  in British Central  Africa was  never realised. Nonetheless,  for  Thorne  this  experience  was  one  of  self-discovery  and racial  awakening.  Before  leaving  England,  he  wrote  to  Bishop  Henry McNeal  Turner  in  America,  whose Voice of Missions he had read. Moreover,  Thorne's  'Africa  for Africans'  letter  to  the African  Times was reprinted  in  full  in  November  1896  in  the Voice  of  Missions .  Given  the

problems of the Pan African Triangle (or quadrangle), his letter to Bishop Turner stated:

The first great lesson we have to learn, I think, is unity. It does not matter  whether  we  are  born  in  Africa,  in  the  United  States  of America,  in  the  West  Indian  Islands  or  in  any  other  part  of  the world.  It  is  enough  that  we  are  all  members  of  the  African  race, whose past history has been the same, whose future is also identical, and  whose  present,  though  it  may  differ  in  a  few  individual instances,  nevertheless  is,  in  the  main,  beset  by  the  same  racial disabilities. 28

This constituted  the  essence  of  the  ideology  of  Pan Africanism  as  the racial vanguard of the African diaspora. Three years after writing to Turner, the  first  Pan African  Conference was called in London with Turner being one of the leading participants. Had Thorne stayed in England, it is more than likely he would have attended the Pan African Conference, and thus, his work would have become better known. What is clear, however, is that his  work  and  idea  of  a  'Zion  on  the  Zambezi'  was  the  preliminary  phase which had laid some of the essential groundwork in the years 1894-97 in England  and  Scotland  for  the  emergence  and  later  development  of  Pan Africanism.

## The influence of Henry Sylvester Williams

Having  laid  the  groundwork  and  departed,  Thorne's  idea  of  an  African homeland remained to be acted upon. The black radicals in Britain during the nineteenth century had seen, as products of the colonial plantations, the relevance  and  importance  of  the  British  and  colonial  working  classes. Indeed,  exploitation  was  relative.  The  small  group  of  black  people  in Britain, because  they  were  easily  identified  and  alien,  suffered  from discrimination  as  no  other  group  before  them.  The  degradation  of  Blacks and  the  pseudo-scientific  arguments  constructed  to  cast  the  black  man  as sub-human, inevitably resulted in certain black responses. Pride in blackness was lacking, and among black men of achievement, it was vital that a sense of dignity, and pride in rate, in the face of degradation should be emphasised and organised.

Among those in the African diaspora, there had to be a 'son of Africa' committed to redeeming the good name and humanity of the African and his people as a whole. In response to James Anthony Froude's negrophobe travel  book The  English  in  the  West  Indies (1888),  J.  J.  Thomas,  a Trinidadian  schoolmaster  wrote Froudacity,  West  Indian  Fables  by  James Anthony  Froude  Explained .  This  well  stated  argument,  however,  was  not enough.  While  many  had  thought  of  the  idea,  few  or  none  had  acted  on behalf of the African peoples until Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian, became aware of this need while he was in London.

Williams  was  born  in  Arouca,  Trinidad,  in  1869  where  the  villagers were mainly of African descent. At that time, slavery had been abolished for some 30 years. In fact, there were people alive when he was growing up who had experienced the 'middle passage' and others who had been born in slavery in Trinidad. Moreover, there were those who had come to Trinidad as 'recaptives'. Many of these Africans were taken from slave ships by the Royal  Navy's  antislave  squadron  and  transported  to  Sierra  Leone  for settlement. In Williams's young mind, Africa and his Africanness were real. The African  form  of  worship, African  drums  and  dances  formed  part  of Trinidadian village life. All this, however, was being increasingly undermined.

British colonial rule had the effect of making Trinidad (and other West Indian colonies) less African, less French and more English. For some, like Williams,  Africa  was  indelibly  written  in  his  youth  and  early  manhood. Issues affecting Africa and Africans did not go unnoticed in Trinidad. The Rev Henry Doughlin told a meeting in San Fernando on 1 August 1888 that it was  the  duty  of  every  African  man  in  Trinidad  to  help  in  Africa's conversion. The fact that Williams knew there were African princes in the land of his ancestors raised many questions. He was particularly concerned with the fact that he had heard only the praises and rituals of white royalty. This troubled him even more because he lived under the British Crown and had received a British education. At the time, agitation for self-government was growing. There were riots and clashes in the early 1880s when James Anthony  Froude  (the  Oxford  University  Professor  of  Modern  History) derided  Trinidadians  and  their  aspirations  to  self-rule  in  his  book The English  in  the  West  Indies .  Among  other  things,  this  sneering  observer considered a constitution with a Black minister and a Black legislature as unthinkable.  What  the  ill-informed  Froude  did  not  know  at  the  time  was

that Trinidad was regarded as the land of chronic agitation for reform. 29 His view of self-government and Trinidadians (as a people) was a reflection of what English politicians and officials (who controlled the political destiny of the island) firmly believed. Williams came to realise this later when he tried to press upon the Colonial Office the case for reform of the Trinidad legislature. Following the 'great reform meeting' black consciousness was heightened during 1888 and 1889.

- J.  J.  Thomas's  book Froudacity was  a  clear  exposition,  which  left  no doubt  of  pride  in  his  blackness  and  concern  for  his  race,  wherever  its members lived. Williams, then only 20 years old, was one of many black readers  of Froudacity . During  this  period,  Thomas's  thoughts  had  an influence on Williams, then a young schoolteacher. Thomas was preoccupied with Africa, the birthplace of his parents and 'the cradle of our race'. He felt, as would others after him, that black people in the Western hemisphere would be better off in Africa. Thus, the back to Africa and Pan African thoughts of Thomas had a major influence on Williams who in turn developed and set the idea in motion, through practical organisation.

After some teaching experience in Trinidad, at the age of 22, Williams went to the United States. As a newcomer, he took a keen interest in the situation of Afro-Americans who were discriminated against, denied equal rights,  terrorised  and  lynched.  He  was  also  concerned  with  the  increasing disenfranchisement of Blacks in the South. In 1891, there were only three Blacks in Congress. But the independence of Blacks was evident in religion and in the formation of a black press. This impressed him. The New York Age , for  example,  focused  attention  on  black  church  activities,  black politics and significantly A. M. E. Bishop Henry McNeal Turner campaigned  for  black  emigration  to  Africa.  It  was  a  time  when  'Africa fever' was spreading among Blacks in the South. Among many there was a strong desire to emigrate to Liberia.

It is more than likely then, that given the wide publicity surrounding it, Williams  was  aware  of  Bishop  Turner's  back  to  Africa  plan  which  was criticised by the New York Age ,  although it was admitted that the idea had 'stirred up unusual interest'. Turner advocated the emigration of '100,000 to 150,000 of the coloured race'. 30

Such  factors  as  racial  barriers  and  the  lack  of  congenial  work  ended Williams's  study  in  the  United  States.  He  had  earned  enough  money  to

begin his studies when he moved to Canada, where he entered Dalhousie University  in  1893.  There  he  was  registered  as  a  general  student  in  the faculty  of  law  during  the  1893-4  session.  Unfortunately,  very  little  is known of his activities as a student at Dalhousie.

In 1896, however, he arrived in England and enrolled at King's College, London where (as at Dalhousie) there has been no trace of his enrolment from the college records. By all accounts Williams had to live frugally. It was not long before he immersed himself in events concerning Africa. His interest  was  encouraged  by  the  protests  of  the  humanitarian  and  liberal interests  with  which  he  was  to  identify.  As  it  was,  1896  was  especially notable in African affairs. 31

While atrocities were being committed in Africa, the English publicist, William  J.  Stead,  editor  of  the Review  of  Reviews ,  pleaded  for  'lenient judgement' for  his  fellow  Englishmen  who  were  'at  the  front  bearing  the heat and burden of the day'. Ironically, Stead also believed in the 'civilising mission' of his race. 32

Although Williams was active in public affairs, he pursued his ambition of reading for the Bar, enrolling at Gray's Inn on 10 December 1897. It was at Gray's Inn that he delivered his first address as Honorary Secretary of the African Association which he had formed. Having forged this link of black brotherhood, it seemed he felt free to enter the bond of inter-racial marriage. He considered no race to be superior to the 'Negro' race. In 1898, at the age of  29,  he  married  a  white  woman, Agnes  Powell,  in  spite  of  her  father's disapproval.

In order to fill the need for a 'body of Africans in England representing native opinion on national matters affecting the destiny of the African race', he founded the African Association on 24 September 1897. The purposes of the Association were:

to encourage a feeling of unity and to facilitate friendly intercourse among Africans in general; to promote and protect the interests of all  subjects  claiming African  descent,  wholly  or  in  part,  in  British colonies  and  other  places, especially in  Africa, by  circulating accurate  information  on  all subjects affecting their rights and privileges as subjects of the British Empire, by direct appeals to the imperial and local Governments. 33

Moreover, the Association's scope was restricted to British subjects and it proposed to protect their rights by appealing to both the British and colonial governments to redress their wrongs.

Predictably, good  wishes  for the future of the Association were counteracted by other comments. The detractors - 'certain English persons' - did not expect the Association to last more than three months, essentially because  they  could  not  see  black  people  uniting  for  such  a  purpose. However, Williams was confident, insisting that the Association would act on its own, draft its own rules, and not be led by Europeans. Although the Association was beset by difficulties, it managed to survive for four years.

Williams acted in keeping with the Association's pledge to protect the interests  of  his African  brethren  by  contacting  well  disposed  MPs  to  ask questions about colonial conditions, particularly in South Africa. He wrote to Chamberlain about the welfare of Africans in Rhodesia and to newspapers such as The Leader on behalf of the Association. He criticised the British government for condoning the introduction of slavery in South Africa  under  the  leadership  of  Cecil  Rhodes.  British  policy  was  clearly questionable  and  he  appealed  to  the  nation  on  behalf  of  the  African Association,  to  lobby  their  representatives  to  bring  about  fairness  and justice to Blacks. He carefully trod the racial path. He did not advocate a complete westernisation of Africa; he was prepared to adopt only what was of value in the European culture while retaining the best of his own. This balancing  of  the  modern  with  the  traditional  would  become  a  recurring theme in the development of Pan Africanism.

In  seeking  a  reversal  of  British  policies  in  the  colonies,  as  imperial power  expanded,  Williams's  task  seemed  hopeless.  Nevertheless,  he  was optimistic; indeed, he had bigger plans.

The African Association's activities spurred the call which was issued as early as 1898 for a Pan African Conference in 1900. Williams had, in fact, conceived of the idea of a world conference of black people in 1897, well before  the  formation  of  the African Association  which  gave  it  credibility. But  he  was  aware  that  his  plans  could  only  materialise  if  he  could  get people to come to London. He thought that the Conference could only get off the ground if he could induce 'representatives of the race' to make the trip.  Some  other  important  event  in  Europe  might  be  helpful.  The  great Exposition which the French were planning to open in Paris in April 1900 was an occasion which might attract Blacks. Williams reasoned that those

Blacks who were going to Paris might be induced to combine their trip with a visit to London for the Conference. This they did.

As preparations for the Conference got under way on 19 March 1898, the African Association issued a circular announcing the intention 'to hold a conference  in  the  month  of  May  (1900)  …  in  order  to  take  steps  to influence  public  opinion  on  existing  proceedings  and  conditions  affecting the welfare of the Natives of the various parts of the British Empire, viz. South  Africa,  West  Africa  and  the  British  West  Indies'. 34 Attention  was focused on conditions in those lands under British rule for which the British government was responsible and for which it was answerable to Parliament.

The  original  Conference  date,  set  for  May  1900  because  of  the  Paris Exposition, was changed on the advice of a number of 'leading men' of the race from Africa, the United States and the West Indies who, while visiting London  for  various  reasons,  attended  a  preparatory  meeting  of  the  Pan African Conference Committee on 12 June 1899. July was more suitable to them and the Committee agreed that the dates should be 23, 24 and 25 July, noting carefully the opening of the World's Christian Endeavour Convention  on  16  July.  Some  of  the  'leading  men'  who  advised  the Committee constitute 'a galaxy of remarkable men': Bishop James T. Holly, Bishop James Johnson, Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, the Rev Dr Majola Agbebi, the Rev C. W. Farquhar, Judge David Augustus Straker, Professor W.  S.  Scarborough,  Henry  Richard  Cargill,  J.  Tengo  Jabavu,  J.  Otonba Payne and Professor Booker T. Washington. 35

In naming  the  Conference,  it  would  seem  that  Williams  and  his associates  were  aware  of  the  Pan-Slav  movement,  the  oldest  of  the  'pan' movements which held a demonstration in Prague in 1898. Of course, there was  also the pan-German  movement  which  sought  to  stimulate  the patriotism  of  race,  to  emphasise  the  solidarity  of  all  German  speaking peoples and to prepare for their political union.

Africans  from  the  diaspora  had  increasingly  begun  to  question  the validity of European oppression. J. M. Bourne was perhaps the only English member of the African Association, and it is possible that sharp criticism of British imperial policy was not always well received by him. However, as the date of the Conference drew near, the task of organising it was entrusted to the Pan African Committee.

The lack of support from the Anti-Slavery Society did not discourage Williams and his supporters. Funds were coming in and the arrangements were going as planned. The Conference was well-timed for those who were also  attending  the  Universal  Paris  Exposition  and  the  World  Christian Endeavour Convention in London. These two events increased the credibility of actually holding the Pan African Conference. For example, W. E.  DuBois  who  prepared  part  of  the American  Negro  exhibit  at  the  Paris Exposition travelled to London. Similar coincidental factors were to recur at the historic 1945 Pan African Congress. Thus, the stage was set.

At a meeting held before the opening of the Conference Williams said that  the  Conference  would  be  'the  first  occasion  upon  which  black  men would  assemble  in  England  to  speak  for  themselves  and  endeavour  to influence  public  opinion  in  their  favour'.  He  specified  the  position  of Blacks in South Africa, warning that their interests must not be overlooked in any settlement reached after the South African war. 36

When the Pan African Conference finally met in 1900, imperialism had reached its zenith. By then Britain had added the following territories to its Empire: Nigeria, Asante, British East Africa (Kenya), Uganda, Nyasaland, Rhodesia and Bechuanaland in Africa; the Sudan, Somaliland and Zanzibar in the Islamic world; and North Borneo, Sarawak, Pahang, Kowloon, Weihai-wai  and  Burma  in  the  Far  East.  Further,  Britain  also  held  extraterritorial rights in thirty-five Chinese cities. Of these territories, none was self-governed. War was everywhere. 37

Bishop  Walters  opened  the  first  Pan  African  Conference  on  23  July 1900. His opening address dealt thoughtfully with 'The Trials and Tribulations of the Coloured Race in America', thus setting the tone of the Conference.  'For  the  first  time  in  history',  he  said,  'Blacks  had  gathered from all parts of the globe to discuss how to improve the condition of the race, to assert the rights of blacks and to organise them so that they might take an equal place among nations.' He argued that in the United States it had been their misfortune to live among a people whose laws, traditions and prejudices  had  always  been  against  Blacks.  It  had  taken  the  Black  two hundred  years  to  gain  personal  emancipation  and  one  hundred  years  to attain standing as a soldier. It would hardly be expected, therefore, that he would get  his  complete  social  and  political  rights  in  35  years.  The  black people in the United States had been able nevertheless to eliminate 45 per

cent of their illiteracy and they now owned $735 million in real estate and personal  property.  And  they  were  now  engaged  in  a  long  and  severe struggle for full social and political rights. 38

In opening the proceedings of the third and final day, Walters spoke in recognition  of  the  services  Whites  in  England  and  the  United  States rendered to the cause of black people. He closed the discussion by saying that  the  object  of  the  Conference  was  to  secure  moral,  political  and  civil rights for Blacks. The force of numbers, he argued, was on their side. The Conference was just the beginning of the work, and it meant that Blacks everywhere would organise for their betterment.

The  first Committee  report  (read  and  adopted)  recommended  the formation  of  a  permanent  Pan  African  Association  with  headquarters  in London  and  branches  overseas.  The  intention  was  that  the  Association would  convene  a  general  meeting  every  second  year  in  a  large  city  in Europe or America or in an independent black state. It was decided that the next meeting would be held in the United States in 1902, and in Haiti in 1904  'to  add  to  the  solemnity  of  the  centenary  celebration  of  Haitian freedom'. 39 Agreement  was  also  reached  to  the  effect  that  the  African Association  would  merge  into  the  new  Pan African Association  and  that other organisations, in existence, whose aims were similar to those of the Pan African Association  would  be  affiliated  on  formal  application  to  the Executive.

The aims and objects of the Pan African Association were:

- 1. To secure to Africans throughout the world true civil and political rights;
- 2. To ameliorate the condition of our brothers on the continent of Africa, America and other parts of the world;
- 3. To  promote  efforts  to  secure  effective  legislation  and  encourage  our  people  in  educational, industrial and commercial enterprise;
- 4. To foster the production of writing and statistics relating to our people everywhere; and
- 5. To raise funds for forwarding these purposes. 40

A matter of importance was the fact that the Conference unanimously adopted an 'Address to the Nations of the World'. The Address appealed to the great powers of the civilised world, expressed faith in 'the wide spirit of humanity and the deep sense of justice' and called for an end to colour and race  prejudice.  The  delegates  of  the  Conference  also  sent  a  separate memorial to Queen Victoria calling for an end to the discrimination against Blacks in South Africa. Moreover, the Address called on Britain to give 'as

soon  as  practicable  the  rights  of  responsible  government  to  the  black colonies of Africa and the West Indies'. The questions of race and colour weighed heavily on the mind of Joseph Chamberlain who regarded Blacks in the West Indies as 'totally unfit for representative institutions'.

The  Address  also  called  for  protection  of  the  American  Negro  from oppression and to grant him 'the right of franchise' and 'security of person and property'. It also called for the Congo Free State of King Leopold to 'become a great central Negro State of the World'.

Finally  the  Address  called  on  the  imperialist  nations  to  respect  the integrity and independence of the free 'Negro' States of Abyssinia, Liberia and Haiti. In addition the Conference sent a memorial on the ill-treatment of Africans and coloureds in South Africa, directly to Queen Victoria. It stated that  the  Pan  African  Conference  comprising  men  and  women  of African blood and descent, respectfully invited her 'august and sympathetic attention to the fact that the situation of the native races in South Africa is causing  us  and  our  friends  alarm'.  In  fact,  the  delegates  expressed  many concerns. 41

After the Conference, organisation of the new Pan African Association was Williams's main task. Among his immediate duties were arranging for the submission  of the memorial  to Queen  Victoria, despatching the 'Address  to  the  Nations',  the  memorials  to  Emperor  Menelik  and  the Presidents  of  Liberia  and  Haiti,  and  the  resolutions  passed  and  letters  of thanks  for  the  assistance  given.  Williams  found  time  to  attend  the  AntiSlavery Congress in Paris. In addition to completing the Conference report, he  was  engaged  in  completing  his  studies  for  the  Bar  final  examination. Between his finals and the Paris visit, the Association was able to establish a permanent headquarters with a bureau 'to disseminate facts and statistics relating to the circumstances and conditions of members of the African race wherever found'. 42

Financially the Conference was unsuccessful, although Williams solicited  and  received  contributions  from  many  sympathetic  persons.  In spite of the problem  of  the  lack  of  funds,  Williams  was  especially concerned about the 'acute ill-treatment of the natives of South Africa' and in  line  with  the  Pan African  Conference  decision,  he  sent  a  memorial  to Queen Victoria. The fact that there was no reply to this memorial disturbed the  Executive Committee. Consequently, Williams was instructed to write

to the  Queen  early  in  1901  enquiring  whether  she  had  received  the memorial. On  17  January, he received a letter from Chamberlain's Secretary, saying that Chamberlain had received 'the Queen's commands to inform you that the memorial of the Pan African Association regarding the situation  of  the  native  races  in  South  Africa  has  been  laid  before  her Majesty and that she was graciously pleased to command him to return an answer to it on behalf of her government'. Chamberlain asked Williams to assure the members of the Pan African Conference that 'in settling the lines on which the administration of conquered territories is to be conducted, Her Majesty's government will not overlook the interests of the native races'. The  letter  also  stated  that  a  copy  of  the  memorial  was  sent  to  the  High Commissioner in South Africa.

Satisfied with this reply that 'the interests of the native races' will not be overlooked,  Williams  sent  the  text  of  the  letter  to The  Times which published it the following day under the heading 'The South African Native Question'  with  an  introductory  paragraph  referring  to  the  Pan  African Conference  and  to  the  General  Secretary  as  'The  Rev  Henry  Sylvester Williams'. Unfortunately, while the memorial mentioned conditions among the  natives  of  South  Africa,  Chamberlain's  reply  referred  only  to  the settlement in the 'conquered territories' such as the Transvaal and Orange River. 43 The fact that this was not a direct reply to the memorial was not surprising since Chamberlain's  views  on  Blacks  generally  were  well known. Acknowledgement of the letter was clearly not enough. Soon after Williams received the reply, the Queen died. During her reign the British Empire expanded by robbery, violence, deceit and forced labour, taking the wealth from the less advanced lands. Yet Williams, the Anglophile, felt that black people should revere the memory of the Queen 'because her first act on ascending the throne was the absolute emancipation of their people and her  very  last  act  was  in  connection  with  them'. 44 Relying  on  favourable British public opinion, Williams was later to see that such an opinion was formed precisely by the promises and deceit of such men as Chamberlain.

Williams  continued  his  work  for  the  Association  by  travelling  to Jamaica,  Trinidad  and  the  United  States  in  an  effort  to  spread  the  word. Branches  were  formed  and,  at  meetings,  subscriptions  were  collected  to fund Pan African , the monthly magazine that Williams hoped to publish in London. While he was in Trinidad, a month after leaving the Association's headquarters in London, 'certain colleagues' had dissolved the Pan African

Association 'on the pretext of lack of funds' and announced it to the press. Although  this  'illegality'  affected  Williams  deeply,  he  made  no  public announcement in Trinidad.

Soon after Williams returned to London on 4 September a meeting was convened  with  members  of  the  Association  on  13  September,  and  they announced  that  the  Pan African Association  would  continue  and  that  the members  elected  to  the  Executive  Committee  would  replace  those  who were 'considered to have resigned'. 46 It was also announced that Williams would continue as General Secretary until 1902 when the next Conference was due in the United States.

Although  Williams  notified  overseas  members,  the  Association  never appeared to have functioned. And while little was known of the fate of the Anglo-Africa Association there is  no  evidence  that  it  functioned  either  in Jamaica  or  in  Trinidad.  The  Pan  African  Association  branches,  however, continued in operation until mid-1902.

In  an  effort  to  keep  the  Association  alive,  Williams  sought  publicity which  he  hoped  would  help  to  enlighten  the  Whites  and  expose  racial inequities.  There  was  no  black  press  through  which  grievances  could  be expressed. Since Blacks had no representation in Parliament, a black-owned newspaper  was  essential.  Conscious  of  these  failings,  Williams  published the  first  issue  of The Pan African in  October  1901. This  monthly  journal dealt  with  matters  'concerning  the  interests  of  the African  descendants  in the British Empire'. Although this approach was similar to the position of the 'Anglo-Africans', it was argued that 'this stance was probably adopted merely  for  convenience  and  was  not  an  abandonment  of  the  Pan African idea'. 47 Be that as it may, Williams was the editor.

Whatever lessons he may have learnt about an independent black press in  the  United  States  was  of  no  avail  in  England.  The  history  of  the Pan African was short and obscure. Ambitiously, the Pan African sought a wide public among Africans, Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. So much so that in February  1902,  a printer in Trinidad, Edgar  McCarthy,  was appointed  local  agent.  But,  by  mid-April  of  that  year,  Williams's  brother was the only person who had to hand 'the back numbers' of the six issues that were printed. No more was heard of the magazine.

While working on the Pan African Williams prepared for his call to the Bar. In the meantime he continued to give public lectures on the status of

the  African  in  the  British  Empire.  On  the  question  of  the  Boer  War, Williams, who felt that the treatment meted out to Blacks by the Boers was one of the principal causes of the war, expected the situation to be resolved following  a  British  victory.  Was  he  yet  again  being  naive  about  British imperialism?

Williams later became involved in municipal politics as a member of the Marylebone Borough Council. His mind was set on a political career. To further his ambition he became a member of the prestigious Liberal Club. While his  scope  in  Borough  Council  politics  was  limited  he  held  out  the brave  hope  of  parliamentary  representation  for  Blacks.  With  a  tiny  black electorate in London, Williams needed a white majority to be elected. He was  fortunate  in  that  his  links  with  the  trade  union  members  among  his colleagues  appeared  to  have  been  closer  than  his  fellow  Progressive candidates, and he had the backing of the General Secretary of the Workers' Union. Eventually, he won a seat, 'becoming probably the first Negro man to be elected to public office in Britain'. For the Progressives in Marylebone, however, and especially the Ward 3 area, the election was a disaster. The Conservatives were jubilant. The Pall Mall Gazette commented on the 'sharp reverses' of Keir Hardie's party whose policy was based on 'an arrogant and ambitious communism'. The Progressives were described as 'socialistic'. 48

As  a  municipal  councillor,  Williams  settled  down  to  work  serving  on two standing committees, legal and parliamentary and housing. Service as a councillor,  however,  did  not  deflect  his  interest  and  devotion  to  African affairs. After a spell of 'protecting Liberian interests' Williams left Africa. Moreover,  he  had  to  abandon  an  unfinished  project  for  a  black  students' club in Oxford - a kind of Pan African students' club - and discontinued his role  as  black  spokesman  in  England.  For  some  unexplained  reason,  he chose to return to his native Trinidad, a small white-dominated colony on the periphery of the British Empire. As it was, Trinidad and Africa were the focal points of interest during his organisational work and representations. To further the ambitious cause of Pan Africanism from this setting was most unlikely.  According  to  his  biographer,  Williams  'perhaps  prematurely, popularised  the  vocabulary  of  black  grievance,  coined  a  useful  phrase, challenged conventional notions regarding Africa and called for a new sort of  British  Empire.  Today's  Commonwealth  would  have  seemed  to  him  a logical outgrowth of his ideas. He was certain that black people were the

equals of any set of humans, and he could point to a large number including himself, who already had demonstrated the proposition. He sought justice and fair competition. He was, finally, a decent and generous man.' 49 Indeed, it can be asserted that he influenced W. E. B. DuBois.

His biographer concludes, 'One who writes about Pan Africanism must write  about  Williams,  but  none  of  the  literature  has.' 50 Like  Thorne  and others (until recently) his work in calling the crucial Pan  African Conference remained largely unknown. These early beginnings initiated in Britain, particularly by Thorne and Williams in the nineteenth century, led to  the  development  and  'dilemma'  of  Pan  Africanism  in  the  twentieth century.

PART TWO:

The 'Black Man's' Burden (1900-1962)

## 4 Britain, Empire and Labour

After the Second World War, one observer wrote that British imperialism, in extreme decay, was not yet finished but strove to adopt many new forms and techniques to meet new conditions, not in order to commit suicide or liquidate itself, but to continue to promote the age-old aims of extracting the super-profits of colonial exploitation. 1

While the British  colonial  system  is  older  than  British  capitalism,  the post-war  Empire,  essentially  a  modern  growth,  dates  back  to  the  late eighteenth century. Indeed, it was through the 'old colonial system' that the primary capital accumulated, making possible the Industrial Revolution. As Marx  put  it,  'The  colonial  system  ripened,  like  a  hothouse,  trade  and navigation  …  The  treasures  captured  outside  Europe  by  undisguised looting,  enslavement  and  murder,  floated  back  to  the  mother  country  and were  there  turned  into  capital.' 2 In  turn,  the  old  colonial  monopoly  was overtaken by world-industrial monopoly. Thus through manipulation of the means  of production and the improvements  in communications, the bourgeoisie of the 'uncivilised' nations (India, Africa and the East and West Indies)  were  drawn  into  'civilisation'.  The  exploitation  and  oppression endemic  in  this  binding  relationship  was  expressed  in  Marx  and  Engels' Communist Manifesto .

Through  these  developments  then,  Britain's  nineteenth  century  world industrial monopoly effected a new phase in the colonial system. This was also a dual system: on the one hand, there were the Dominions (Canada and Australia) where  British  settlers either exterminated  or  displaced  the original inhabitants to become the colonial wing of the British; on the other, there were the conquered and the enslaved colonial countries which served as sources of cheap raw materials extracted through the plantation system and by peasant labour under semi-starvation conditions. These colonies also served  as  markets  for  British  exports.  Flooding  the  local  markets  with British  goods  led,  in  large  measure,  to  the  ruin  of  the  native  handicraft industries.

Britain's  economic power seemed enviable until the Great Depression of the 1870s when, for the first time, the supremacy of British exports was weakened by powerful new industrial rivals - first the United States, then Germany. This competition resulted in an extension of the export of capital and the scramble for new colonial possessions. Thus, the way was prepared for the twentieth century era of imperialism.

In 1880 British steel output stood at 1.3 million tons, that of the USA at 1.2 million and Germany's at 700,000. By 1900 American steel output had reached 10.2 million tons, German 6.4 million and the British 4.9 million. By  1913 American  steel  output  reached  31.3  million  tons,  German  18.9 million and British 7.7 million. However, Britain still maintained the first position  in  the  export  of  manufactured  goods  although  with  a  lessening proportion. But, in the export of capital and colonial expansion, Britain was far ahead.

Between 1884 and 1900 Britain acquired 3,700,000 square miles of new colonial territories. By 1914 the British Empire covered 12.7 million square miles,  with  a  population  of  431  millions,  of  which  the  White  Dominions totalled  60  million.  A  further  one  and  a  half  million  square  miles  were acquired through the imperialist war of 1914-18. Thus, by the eve of the Second  World  War  the  British  Empire's  protectorates  and  dependencies, covered approximately one-quarter of the earth's surface and one-quarter of the world's population. 3 In effect, the era of industrial capital gave way to the era of finance capital. Britain still remained the great colonial exploiter.

This exploitation was vital to Britain. In the face of a rising challenge from  the  British  working  class,  Lenin  quoted  Cecil  Rhodes  as  saying  in 1895:

I was in the East End of London yesterday and I attended a meeting of the 'unemployed'. I listened to the wild speeches which were just a cry for 'bread', 'bread', 'bread', and on my way home I pondered over  the  scene  and  I  became  more  than  ever  convinced  of  the importance of imperialism … My cherished idea is a solution for the social  problem.  In  order  to  save  the  40,000,000  inhabitants  of  the UK from a bloody civil war, we, colonial statesmen, must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for  the  goods  produced  by  them  in  the  factories  and  mines.  The Empire, as I have always said, is a bread and butter question. If you want to avoid civil war, you must become an imperialist. 4

## East Indian labour: the abolition of indentureship

The  change  in  the  Indian  indentured  labourers'  circumstances  came  only with  the  change  in  sugar  production.  The  shift  towards  fewer  estates  and larger,  central  sugar  mills  resulted  in  a  movement  from  an  estate-based population into a rural small-holder or peasant population. This modification of the plantation system gave some freedom from its pervasive grip. The system came under increasing scrutiny and pressure. There was a 'long, long period' during which  it was  questioned  and  challenged. Mohandas  K.  Gandhi  was  right  in  identifying  Lord  Curzon  as  the  first Viceroy of India to see that the indentured Indians were mere helots of the Empire and the first to question the system. Gandhi's own attempts in South Africa  helped  to  highlight  some  of  the  problems  of  the  Indians  as  an important political issue. Thus, both Gandhi and Curzon called the system into question.

The movement to abolish Indian indentureship was gathering momentum. In South Africa, the Indians were on the march; in Mauritius, they were moved to periodic protest; but in the Caribbean the only political movement was that of the Creole Blacks. In Trinidad, the Working Men's Association was opposed to further Indian immigration as a threat to wages and  living  standards.  And  in  British  Guiana,  the  Peoples'  Association,  a black organisation, protested against taxation levied to promote immigration. 5 It was  against  this  background  of  colonial  resistance  to indentured labour that the Sanderson Committee began its work.

Gandhi's struggle against oppressive laws in South Africa had become a mass campaign of Satyagraha, in which the majority of participants were indentured and ex-indentured Indians. At last, through exceptional leadership, given the historical moment, the coolies were being mobilised. By 1913, the atmosphere was highly charged by the news that Gandhi had launched his most massive Satyagraha campaign. His main appeal was to the indentured coolies employed in the Dundee and Newcastle districts of Natal. The labourers abandoned their work and marched with Gandhi to the Transvaal  border.  Over  200  were  arrested,  including  Gandhi  who  was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. 6

This news  reached Whitehall and Delhi quickly. Lord Hardinge responded  in  an  extraordinary  speech  stating  that  the  Indians  in  South Africa  'have  violated,  as  they  intended  to  violate,  those  laws,  with  full knowledge of the penalties involved. … In all this they have the sympathies of India - deep and burning - and not only of India but of those who like myself  …  have  feelings  of  sympathy  for  the  people  of  this  country.' 7 Having  made  this  pronouncement  which,  understandably  was  'open  to criticism'  (because  it  came  'straight  from  the  heart'),  the  British  Cabinet considered his recall from India, but did not want to precipitate an Indian backlash. Against this background of events, the McNeill and Chimman Lal Report  on  the Condition  of  Indian  Immigrants  in  Four  British  Colonies: Trinidad,  British  Guiana,  Jamaica  and  Fiji and  in  the  Dutch  colony  of Surinam was considered.

While  Gandhi  (who  was  preparing  to  return  to  India)  recognised  the importance  of  the  Viceroy's  intervention,  with  Indian  independence  in mind,  he  attached  greater  importance  to  Satyagraha.  Subsequently,  the McNeill and Chimman Lal report was circulated and the First World War intervened.  By  1915,  Indian  feeling  about  emigration  was  only  partly aroused. In January, Gandhi had returned to India. There, several organisations  were  founded  especially  to  fight  coolie  emigration. Among them  were  the  Indian  Coolie  Protection  Society  and  the  Anti-Indentured Emigration  League  of  Bengal.  Later,  other  organisations  joined  in  the protest such as the Home Rule League, the Bengal Province Congress, the UP Congress, the League for the Abolition of Indentured Emigration, the Anti-Indenture  League  of  Madras  and  the  Punjab  Provincial  Moslem

League. 8

Moreover,  during  January  and  February  1917,  Gandhi  continued  to speak  out  against  indenture.  He  was  suspicious  that  the  Government  of India might keep the system going for another five years and pressed for a definite early date for complete abolition.

Finally,  in  1917,  Indian  indenture  had  officially  ended.  But,  Indians were still bound by indenture in the sugar colonies: a continuing servitude that was  unacceptable  to  the  Indian  public. In December,  1919,  all outstanding indentures were terminated in British Guiana. Still outstanding, however, was the fact that the indenture system as a working reality had to be cleared away, once and for all. In theory, at least, the labourers were free. Ironically, many  Indians  having  pined  for  their  homeland,  eventually returned to India to find that industrial conditions there, after the famine of 1920,  had  been  unfavourable.  The  returned  emigrants  experienced  great difficulty in obtaining suitable employment. Many of them were colonialborn  and  found  themselves  utter  strangers  in  the  country.  The  India-born found that their long residence in the colonies had rendered them unfit for the old social conditions. These repatriates, after spending all their savings drifted back to Calcutta in the hope of finding ships to take them back to their homes in the sugar colonies. 9

Thus,  the  indentured  coolies,  many  of  them  long  forgotten,  returned home to realise a state of hopelessness. Strangely, the familiar bounds of the plantations offered the only hope. And so the Indian diaspora, achieved a settled,  permanent  foothold,  existing  side  by  side  with Africans  in Africa and in the African diaspora.

Thereafter, Indians continued to emigrate. Their concern was not with the  colonies  where  the  Indians  remained  the  working  poor.  Instead,  they looked  towards  East  and  South  Africa  where  the  Indians  were  trying  to establish  themselves  as  urban  middle  class  communities.  Their  attention was directed especially to East Africa, to Kenya and Uganda.

The first major threat to reduce the status of overseas Indians emerged in  Kenya where the white settlers plotted to force the hand of the British government. The Indians were now mostly traders. Despite protest and nonco-operation,  the  East  African  Indians  were  forced  to  accept  an  uneasy middle position between the Europeans, at the top, and the Africans at the bottom; clearly an unsettled and unsettling buffer position.

In  South Africa  during  the  1920s,  the  Indian  community  came  under attack as legislation eroded their rights; those who left the country could not return,  and  dependants  were  denied  entry. They  were  profoundly  affected by  the  Class  Areas  Bill,  introduced  in  1925,  which  confined  Indians  to separate  residential  and  commercial  areas.  The  Indian  government  and politicians  protested  loudly.  Yet,  they  could  do  little  to  confront  South African racism effectively. Motilal Nehru told the Indian Congress in 1928 that the best way to help Indians overseas was to act 'to gain our freedom here'. Clearly then, colonial exploitation had to continue, though it would be tempered by grudging concessions to colonial labour.

Twentieth century politicians, certainly by the end of the Second World War, were unanimous that the Empire was the essential economic base on which the British working class would be saved from starvation. In 1929, Winston Churchill, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, was able to say that the social services in Britain was dependent on the income from imperialist exploitation. 10 Lord  Cranbourne,  the  Dominions  Secretary,  reminded  the British  people  that  their  employment  and  standard  of  living  depended mainly on the existence of the Empire. And in 1946, the Labour trade union leader, Ernest Bevin told the House of Commons that he was not prepared to sacrifice the British Empire for if it fell it would mean a considerable fall in the standard of living of 'our constituents'. 11

It  emerges very clearly from these statements that the exploitation and degradation of the colonial working class was an indispensable requirement in maintaining the standard of living of the British working class. Implicit in  this  argument  is  the  fact  that  the  British  economy  is  really  a  'parasitic economy' dependent on colonial revenues for its maintenance. The concentration on foreign investment, as opposed to industrial renewal, and neglect of home investment would have serious repercussions. For so long as  the  British  ruling  class  could  amass  huge  profits  (at  the  expense  of minimum and starvation level standards of living in the colonies) attention was  deflected  from  the  growing  neglect  of  industrial  and  agricultural investment in Britain. Indeed, there was every reason for optimism that the British working class would continue to benefit from colonial exploitation. Before  the  First  World  War  nearly  one-fifth  of  British  imports  were  no longer paid for by exports of goods. And on the eve of the Second World War nearly two-fifths of British imports were no longer paid for by exports of goods. The import surplus (or invisible balance of trade) rose from £30

million in 1855-59 to £134 million in 1913 to £302 million in 1938, and £438 million in 1947. Initially, this import surplus was covered by income from  overseas  investment  such  as  financial  commissions  and  shipping. Later,  however,  the  tide  had  turned  to  the  extent  that  even  the  overseas income could not cover the unpaid imports. Consequently, in the late 1930s, a  net  deficit  on  the  balance  of  payments  reached  £380  million  and  £630 million in 1947. 12

If  imperialism  means  violent  aggression,  then  the  imperialist  basis  of the  British  economy  was  clearly  founded  on  an  unstable  dependence  on colonial  exploitation.  Repressive  force  exerted  over  the  colonial  working classes was,  sooner  or  later, bound  to  lead  to  violent  reaction.  The disturbances  or  'riots',  as  they  were  called,  in  India,  Africa,  Trinidad, Jamaica  and  elsewhere  in  the  West  Indies,  during  the  decades  before  the Second World War, were symptomatic of the weakness of British imperialism. Increasingly, as cracks appeared in the system, costly military manoeuvres  were  required  to  maintain  law  and  order  in  the  colonies. Consequently,  there  was  neglect  and  decay  of  British  home  industries. Thus, the first industrial nation, once 'the workshop of the world', lagged behind the United States of America and Germany, with an accumulation of obsolete  machinery  and  equipment.  The  coal  industry,  for  example,  was 'worse than stagnant' before 1900, and textiles machinery was notoriously obsolete  in  the  majority  of  factories.  This  lag  was  both  absolute  and relative. 13

Between  the  wars  this  deterioriation  accelerated.  Coal  production  fell from 287 million tons in 1913 to 230 million in 1938. Between 1920 and 1935  fourteen  million  spindles  were  destroyed;  one-third  of  the  British shipyards  were  closed  down  and  British  shipping  capacity  was  reduced from three to two million tons annually. Moreover, in agriculture between 1918  and  1938,  over  two  million  acres  of  arable  land  went  out  of cultivation. 14

But in spite of the decay of the basic industries, secondary and luxury services expanded. As the proportion of the working population engaged in production in the basic industries fell from 23 per cent in 1851 to 13.6 per cent in 1929, the numbers employed in commercial and financial operations, distribution, office employment and a variety of 'services' rose continually.  Thus,  from  these  secondary  industries  a  'new  middle  class'

emerged.  By  1937  the  'foreign  investment'  which  made  this  prosperity possible  was  described  by  the Economist as  'the  nation's  greatest  single industry'. 15

The  consequence  of  this  'new  middle  class'  was  to  act  as  a  buffer between  the  decline  and  depression  of  the  productive  working  class  in industry. This transformation in the productive base of the British economy had  restructured  and  divided  the  British  working  class.  In  the  labour hierarchy,  based  on  imperialism,  British  working  class  solidarity  was difficult  to  achieve,  with  the  upper  section  opposing  the  lower.  Lenin's observation of this in the early twentieth century was revealing:

In Great Britain the tendency of imperialism to divide the toilers … to  encourage  opportunism  amongst  them  and  to  give  rise  to  a temporary organic decay in the working class movement, revealed itself much earlier than the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth  centuries.  For  two  big  distinctive  features  of imperialism applied to Britain from midway through the nineteenth century: vast colonial possessions and a monopolist position in the world markets. Marx and Engels systematically followed, over some decades  this  relation  between  working  class  opportunism  and  the imperialistic peculiarities of English capitalism. 16

## The British labour movement and imperialism

Thus, Labour imperialism brought workers of both factions of the working class  under  closer  control  of  capitalist  policies.  In  forming  this  alliance, those  in  the  labour  movement  who  fought  for  the  advance  of  socialism (with few exceptions) became converts who hammered out their own brand of  imperialist  labour  policy.  Both  the  MacDonald  Labour  governments between the wars, and the third Labour government's policies demonstrated this.

The  early  socialists, Keir  Hardie  and  Tom  Mann,  fought  against capitalist  policies  and  an  alliance  with  capitalists.  Both  men  had  travelled abroad and seen the effects of imperialism on the colonial working class. They, like Lenin and Stalin, had observed (under capitalism) the shift from old  Labour  reformism  to  Labour  imperialism.  In  effect,  this  meant  an 'open' alliance of Reformism with imperialism. Churchill's declaration that

the social services was dependent on overseas investment income received full  recognition  as  Labour  reformism  accepted  the  permanency  of  the 'income' as the basis for its social services, which they preferred to label the Welfare State.

To get a better understanding of Labour imperialism, let us take a brief look at official Labour policy in the Empire. In effect, the Labour leaders in government had become connected with the ruling class. Indeed, there was little  to  choose  between  the  arguments  of  Labour  imperialism  and  the Conservatives  on  the  colonial  question.  Whatever  charity  or  welfare  the Labour  government  would  dole  out  to  the  working  class  was  clearly calculated. Although the Labour Party had formed a government, they had not  seized  power.  In  effect,  they  had  become  the  protectors  of  the status quo ,  of British imperialist interests. Indeed, they did well to project a proworking class image.

Before  looking  at  the  main  themes  uttered  by  Labour  government ministers  and  official  Labour  Party  spokesmen  on  the  Empire,  let  us consider the general approach of the main sections of the Labour movement to imperial issues between 1899 and 1924.

During this period there were both objective changes taking place in the Labour movement and new and old influences which accompanied them. This was a time of rapid change within the Labour movement, from being industry-centred to being Parliament-centred. Whereas in 1899 the annual convention  of  the  movement  was  the  Trades  Union  Congress,  it  was emphatically the Labour Party Conference in 1924.

As a Parliamentary force, Labour was hard-pressed to play the role of a national  party.  This  meant  involvement  in  debates  on  the  major  issues  of economic  policy,  imperial  policy  and  labour  conditions.  Thus  began  the process of change from a party of protest to a party ready to participate in government. Moreover, this twenty-five year period saw the beginning of its involvement in the sphere of imperial policy.

Given this change in status, the Labour movement in Parliament meant that mere working class slogans could no longer be accepted as a substitute for  policy  in  Parliament.  The  Labour  movement  had  to  adjust  itself  to Parliamentary demands both for knowledge of the problems and the ability to  present  an  alternative  policy.  Overwhelmingly,  the  Labour  movement took the Parliamentary road to socialism. Thus constrained by the grip of

ruling  class  politics,  by  1924  they  were  still  casting  about  for  an  agreed method through which policy could be devised.

These objective changes in Labour's role and status in British society were  accompanied  by  old  and  new  influences.  Firstly,  when  the  'Little England radicalism' was put to the test before 1914 in the Boer War over South African  Union,  Labour  was  on  the  side  of  the  radicals  (within  the movement)  in  the  tone  of  their  arguments,  in  lobbying  and  voting.  The differences were in emphasis. 17

After 1914, the interaction between radicalism and the Labour movement  became  more  complicated.  The  clear  shift  of  the  Union  of Democratic Control, resulting  from  the  new  alignments  brought  about  by the war, was a rapid move to the left. By 1924, the UDC was absorbed by the  Labour  Party.  Radicalism  and  advanced  liberalism  after  1914  was  no longer just an influence on the Labour movement, but an integral part of it. This  reinforced  the  position  of  those  like  MacDonald  who  advocated  a reformed  Empire  and  Labour's  interest  in  imperial  problems.  The  new internationalism of 1918 afforded Labour a chance to argue that the world had changed, and that imperialism was a greater danger to world peace.

In  spite  of  the  diversity  of  views  within  the  Labour  movement  in general, it could be said that there was a minimum set of assumptions which all  Labour  men  could  have  applied  to  the  Empire.  Firstly,  the  Labour movement believed that the Empire should be reformed and not abandoned. This  immediately  put  Labour  into  the  category  of  a  bourgeois  reformist party; secondly, most Labour men, after 1914-18 believed that a reformed British  Empire  should  not  only  have  'Home  Rule  All  Round',  but  also economic  justice.  The  concept  of  trusteeship  for  native  races  in  the economic sphere was in line with the Labour movement's demand for social justice at home. This had been advocated by Hardie and MacDonald before the war. Indeed, Labour  and the New  Social  Order urged colonial development in the interests of the natives; and thirdly, with the exception of  South  Africa,  the  Labour  movement  adopted  a  position  of  'absentminded friendship' for the white settlers of the Empire. Australia, Canada and  New  Zealand  were  immigration  outlets  for  the  British  working  class who wished to 'escape' from economic depression and social oppression.

On the question of the Labour movement's attitude and policy towards the Empire  during  this  twenty-five  year  period, given  that 'Labour' describes  the  organisations  and  functions  of  a  group  of  people  and  not  a

doctrine,  Labour  parties  can  be  doctrinally  collectivist  like  the  British Labour  Party  after  1918,  or  individualist,  like  the  South  African  Labour Party.  When,  therefore,  we  look  for  something  'distinctively  labour'  in Labour's imperial policy, we can expect it to be doctrinally neutral. 18

According to one observer, 'this indeed is what we find'. Significantly (and paradoxically), British Labour  has  consistently backed, at least verbally, labour  movements  and  parties  in  the  Empire,  whether  they practised  racial  discrimination,  as  in  South  Africa,  or  civil  disobedience against Britain, as in India. This certainly is a distinctively 'labour' policy. During  this  period  there  was  very  little  criticism  of  the  Empire  from  the ranks of British Labour. As a corollary, British Labour opposed all attempts by governments or businessmen in the Empire to practise anti-trade union labour and strike-breaking. However, this doctrinal neutralism adapted itself poorly to Labour's status as a national party. Not surprisingly therefore, the distinctively 'socialist' element in Labour's imperial policy has been more lasting and has produced a more coherent set of attitudes.

After  1918,  the  socialism  professed  by  the  British  Labour  movement was  social  reformism:  in  other  words,  the  policy  of  greater  social  and economic  equality  through  redistributive  measures  aimed  at  the  wealthy, individuals or capitalist organisations. While the nature and timing of these measures was a matter for debate within the movement, the objectives were agreed.

On  the  basis  of  this  definition,  it  was  only  after  1918  that  Labour's policy  for  the  Empire  became  distinctively  non-socialist.  Before  this, Hardie's  views  on  India  were  readily  accepted.  But  few  Liberals  would have agreed to dispossess the white Kenyan settlers after 1918. Similarly they would have opposed Labour's policy of a rapid approach to manhood suffrage  in  India.  Such  policies,  aiming  at  rapid  and  fundamental  social change  and  attacking  the  possessors  of  wealth,  were  the  policies  of egalitarian socialism. But even so, post-1918 socialist policies were not so very different from radical policies. Indeed, the men who were advocating socialism in the Empire were ex-radicals disgusted with the Liberal Party. The Labour Party owed far more to British radicalism than to continental socialism. The Fabians, socialists with a strong tinge of British radicalism, reinforced the ex-Liberals in the conviction that the Empire should not be immediately  abandoned,  but  reformed.  Such  a  reformation,  they  argued, would  strengthen  rather  than  weaken  Britain.  In  this  traditionally  British

way the Labour Party reconciled equality with patriotism. It was an uneasy reconciliation,  open  to  attack  from  the  right  and  left,  but  it  is  only  by understanding this objective that we can begin to understand the hesitation and mistakes of Labour's policy after 1924.

One of the themes emphasised after the Second World War on the old Labour imperialist line was that the Empire was essential to the economic interests  of  British  workers.  Repeatedly,  contradictions  appeared  in  the speeches of Labour ministers, combining the philanthropic aims of Empire with the aims of economic exploitation. In this, the true relationship of the British  and  colonial  working  classes  are  revealed.  Justifying  this  Labour imperialism, one of the champions of the British Labour movement, Ernest Bevin  said  in  Parliament  on  21  February  1946:  'I  am  not  prepared  to sacrifice the British Empire [because] I know that if the British Empire fell … it  would  mean  that  the  standard  of  life  of  our  constituents  would  fall considerably.' 19 Thus, the exploitation of the British working class and the colonial  working  class  was  relative.  Indeed,  the  government's  Four  Year Economic Plan for 1949-53, submitted to the Marshall Plan organisation in December 1948, was aimed at achieving economic recovery and balancing Britain's trading deficit. In fact, they contemplated a large increase in the contribution  of  the  colonies  to  European  recovery. 20 That  same  year  Mr Bevin, as Foreign Secretary, told the National Union of Manufacturers on 14 October 1948: 'We have ceased to be an Imperialist race; we dominate nobody.' Yet he went on to state:

I believed and still believe that If  we  can  organise Western Europe with its direct connection with the Middle East, If we can use the great resources of our Colonial Empire in Africa, If  we  can  work  out  our  co-operation  with  our  great  Dominion  of South Africa, If we can arrange matters correctly with Pakistan and India, If we can maintain a correct position in South-East Asia, and

If  we  can  make  our  proper  contribution  to  the  revivification  of China, then with a little planning we somehow occupy the position of  a  general  balancing  factor  as  between  East  and  West,  and  may

provide  the  correct  equipoise  and  the  correct  equilibrium  for  the maintenance of peace and prosperity in the world. 21

This  fallacious  emphasis  on  peace  (and  prosperity,  for  whom?)  was contrary to the dynamic of imperialism which, in effect, means war! Thus, as the post-war Labour government moved to implement policies at home, to  appease working class tensions and demands through a British Welfare State,  abroad,  they  adopted  rapacious  plans  to  solve  Britain's  economic problems  by  assuming  a  'seven-fold'  increase  in  net  invisible  earnings between  1948/9  and  1952/3.  Of  course,  this  goal  was  to  be  achieved through  intensified  exploitation  of  the  working  classes  in  the  colonies.  It must  also  be  remembered  that  Britain  had  also  exploited  black  labour during  both  wars,  at  home  and  abroad.  Indeed,  the  year  before  Bevin delivered  his  'peace  and  prosperity'  speech,  there  were  racial  'riots'  in Liverpool, and a 'colour bar' had emerged as a 'problem' in Britain whether or not Bevin knew it.

Moreover, in 1948 the SS Empire Windrush had arrived in Britain with some  four  hundred  West  Indian  immigrants,  including  former  volunteer workers who had worked in British munitions factories during the war. This group  of  immigrants  added  to  the  earlier  black  settlements  of  Liverpool, Cardiff,  Hull  and  in  various  parts  of  London;  a  legacy  of  British  Labour imperialism.  It  is against  this background  that  we  must  look  at  the experience  of  black  workers  prior  to,  and  after  the  First  World  War, particularly in Cardiff and Liverpool.

## Cardiff: black seamen and soldiers

In  the  centuries  of  British  trade  with Asia, Africa, America  and  the  West Indies,  many  black  men  were  employed  on  British  ships.  Bristol  and Liverpool were two British ports where black seamen settled. By the turn of the century, the port of Cardiff had begun to join the ranks of British ports with a growing black community. In this maritime community, the Blacks in Cardiff inhabited the dockland  area, known  as  Bute  Town.  This population was highly concentrated in the neighbouring South Ward. On the whole, black people in Cardiff lived within the boundary of Bute Street and the Glamorgan Canal, and between Greek Church Street and Hodges Row.

Cardiff became a port of mercantile significance at the end of the First World  War  clearing  a  net  registered  tonnage  of  vessels  from  over  one million  in  1857  to  12.6  million  before  1914.  The  shipping  depression between the wars did not stop imports and exports which continued, albeit on a downward scale. Imports included iron ore, fruit, vegetables, pitwood and grain; and exports were coal, coke, patent fuel and flour. 22

In  addition  to  the  trading  activity  the  port  was  attractive  to  black seamen,  because  of  the  mildness  of  the  climate.  It  is  more  than  likely, however,  that  the  deciding  factor  was  the  employment  conditions  in  the shipping  industry.  Cardiff  offered  employment  to  both  white  and  black seamen. (Although tramp employment served a longer voyage than a liner, it  had  the  disadvantage  -  if  it  be  so  considered  -  of  no  job  permanence.) Liner  routes;  on  the  other  hand,  were  necessarily  less  casual  in  their demands.

Employment in the dock area for the black seaman was all-important, since  other  forms  of  employment  were  denied  him.  Historically,  the  first decade of  the  twentieth  century  is  important  for  the  black  community.  In 1911, Havelock Wilson led a national strike of seamen in order to form a national union. This strike was of major significance. The seamen demanded the right to industrial recognition and complained of low wages and deplorable working conditions. In his attack, Wilson and his colleagues in the union used the employment of foreign seamen on British ships as a major  grievance.  They  argued  that  employers  in  shipping  had  adopted  a policy  of  discrediting  white  seamen  abroad,  who  were  replaced  by  black seamen at lower wages. 23 Moreover, when the laid-off white British seamen returned home and signed-on, they had to accept the lower going rate for the job.

The unions had good reason for complaint. For one thing, labour in the shipping  industry  was  dependent  on  a  workforce  of  various  nationalities which was incapable of organisation. Captain Edward Tupper explained the difficulties:  'The  men  of  the  Tyne,  say,  had  in  many  respects  a  different sense of values from the men of the Mersey, or Southampton water. Even now  a  ship  owner  would  avoid  putting  a  mixed  crew  of  Liverpool  and Southampton on a big ship; a friction would set up. Just as a ship would not man with both Madras and Calcutta lascars.' 24

Indeed,  the  union's  objective  was  to  organise  all  seamen  serving  on British  ships.  In  this  it  was  successful.  Employment  on  British  ships between 1890 and 1903 of foreign seamen had been increased from 27,000 to 40,000 while the number of British seamen had decreased by 10,000. By 1912,  the  situation  had  changed  with  an  increase  of  about  30,000  British seamen and a reduction of 9000 foreign seamen. The decline in the casual employment of foreigners on British ships was even more drastic, falling from 40,000 in 1902 to 8000 in 1935. 25

During the First World War, the unions ensured that an alien employed on  a  British  ship  must  be  paid  at  the  going  British  rates.  This  ruling continued under the National Maritime Board. It applied however only to seamen  engaged  at  home  ports  or  on  European  articles.  There  were exceptions  to  this  rule.  Black  seamen,  for  example,  sailing  on  the  West African  liner  trade  from  Liverpool  could  be  engaged  at  lower  rates  than white seamen. The NMB acted as the Trades Council of the industry since its function was to negotiate with the employers. 26 It did not deal with ships which  sign  on  their  crews  at  a  non-British  port.  Consequently,  in Asiatic and Lascar articles there was a wide gap for wage manipulation. Later, this was to have extremely adverse effects on the black community in Cardiff.

Moreover,  merchant  seamen  employment  at  the  beginning  of  the century,  according  to  Tupper,  was  a  system  of  'slavery  and  starvation'. Wages,  he  argued,  'were  from  £2.15 .  to  £3.15 s s .  a  month;  £1.7 s .6 d .  to £1.10 . a week …; it was generally inadequate, often enough disgusting.' 27 s The  system  constituted  low  wages,  debt,  occasional  drunkenness,  fraud, graft and unemployment. In short, the full catastrophe of depression. Times were particularly hard for the black seaman  who  sought continued employment in a depressed industry in which there was little public interest during the inter-war period. The world economic slump had brought misery to  Tiger  Bay  and  elsewhere.  Blacks  in  Cardiff,  the  victims  of  social  and economic circumstances in which they lived and worked, were caught in a vicious circle of racial prejudice and discrimination in employment.

During the 1890s black people had settled in small numbers in Loudon Square. During 1914-18, the black community increased through waves of immigration. The demands of war brought to Britain those who in normal circumstances would have been repatriated by the government to 'their own country'.  The  abnormality  of  war-time  conditions  then  legitimised  their

entry and stay. During the war 200 men from black troops in Mesopotamia were transferred by the government to work in the merchant navy. A smaller number of black seamen arrived in England after 1914 as internees  from Germany. 28   British  ships  employing  black  seamen  operating  on  the  West African  and  other  routes were  'requisitioned by  the government  for transport service and their crews left behind'. Blacks went  also to Manchester and other cities to work in the munition and chemical factories, and in the ports of Liverpool and London, a similar situation obtained. As a consequence, large numbers of Blacks were domiciled in Britain.

With the closure of the war industries and other forms of employment, many black workers went to Cardiff where they were employed as seamen. The  laying-up  of  ships  in  Cardiff  contributed  to  the  increased  number  of West Africans and West Indians. Taken together, this influx of more Blacks had changed the character of the district to the extent that Loudon Square and the street surrounding it came to be known as the 'coloured quarter' of the city. Confined to this space, living accommodation for Blacks was poor and overcrowded. By the end of the First World War, single dwelling houses became  apartment  houses  with  two  or  three  persons  living  in  the  space hitherto occupied by one. During the war, and up to 1919, there was 'good money' to be earned as seamen. Through hard work and thrift, some black men prospered. Demobilisation resulted in large numbers of Navy seamen returning to their pre-war trade in the depressed shipping industry.

Given job scarcity, ship-owners and ship-masters took the provocative line of adopting  the  principle  of  'our  own  people  first'.  In  fact,  in September 1919, the Trades Union Congress passed a resolution condemning Asiatic  labour;  preference  to  be  given  first  to  British  white, then  British  black  labour. 29 This  divisive  action  caused  hostility  between Blacks and Whites. The British strategy of 'divide and rule' so successfully practised  overseas  was  now  being  implemented  to  separate  'colonised' Blacks from the rest of the British population. Consequently, 1200 unemployed Blacks faced severe economic hardship. They received unemployment pay of 29 . per week which contrasted sharply to earnings s of £15 per month during the war. 30 The prosperity which a few of the black seamen enjoyed provoked great resentment among white seamen who, on returning home to Cardiff, earned less for seamen's work than the better-off black man. This discrepancy, plus the fact that the soldiers were themselves

unable to find employment, contributed to rising tension between white and black  seamen  in  the  area.  Given  these  factors  and  undercurrents,  serious racial  riots  broke  out  in  Cardiff  in  June  1919,  with  wide  repercussions. There were disturbances in almost every port area of Britain where Blacks had settled or resided.

## The 1919 racial riots and after

Prior to the Cardiff riots there were disturbances in Liverpool and Newport in  February  and  March.  Earlier  in  1911,  there  were  race  riots  in  Cardiff involving  the  Chinese  community. 31 The  Cardiff  riots  of  1919  had  a profound  effect  on  the  black  community  for  whom  these  were  bitter experiences.

The trouble started on 10 June 1919 with a scuffle involving some white and black men. In the commotion a gun was fired. Soon a crowd of about 2000 people had gathered. A second shot was fired and several fights broke out (at the town end of Canal Parade) along Bute Street and its side streets. More gunshots followed. The mob was angry; they were out to get black men.  They  attacked  shops  in  Bute  Street,  completely  demolishing  one  where black men lived. 32

In  the  same  street  two  other  houses  were  badly  damaged  while  fire broke out in a black-owned boarding house. After an hour of violence and destruction,  the  fire  brigade  intervened.  In  the  aftermath,  one  person  was killed, while 14 others were injured. There was more savagery to come.

With time to plan, a better-organised attack was mounted on the evening of  11  June.  This  assault,  described  as  the  'Sidney  Street  Affair',  started early in the evening when a large crowd assembled near the Hayes Bridge. They proceeded to attack a house in Millicent Street where eight black men lived. Gunshots were fired at these men from nearby warehouses. Leading the charge were two uniformed soldiers. Confronted by 'armed' black men, they retreated and regrouped before advancing with a table for protection. In response to this attack, the besieged black men used razor blades and a revolver to defend themselves. While this battle raged in the house, a large crowd  which  had  gathered  outside,  ghoulishly,  'looked  on  admiringly'. Clearly, the racists had many supporters.

When the police and fire-brigade eventually intervened, they took the Blacks  into  protective  custody.  The  tension  and  excitement  generated  by these incidents showed no signs of abatement. For some days, outbreaks of

rioting  continued.  The  mob  were  confronted  with  a  large  police  presence and 'soldiers in full fighting order'. In spite of this show by the forces of law and order, the angry crowds pursued unlucky Blacks. Finally, the mob dispersed. Several black men who lived in Cardiff at this time said that for several  days  during  the  riots,  they  were  forced  to  remain  in  their  houses behind boarded windows and barred doors. 33

While  these  racist  attacks  on  the  black  community  might  have  been organised by a relatively small number of persons, there was no doubt that it  caused  the  maximum  physical  and  psychological  damage  to  the  black community. Black men were hunted and beaten by the mobs and yet one sociologist has suggested that 'Not one out of twenty members of the crowd could explain why the trouble arose.' This is particularly incredible when the chief comments heard were 'why should these coloured men be able to get work when it is refused to us?' Furthermore, sexual relations between black men and white women were also cited. 34 In  general,  the  mood  was kill  and/or  lynch  black  people.  The  bogey-man  was  always  black;  the scapegoat who was 'rooted out' and rushed upon by the mob.

In  counting  the  cost  (the  claims  for  damage,  mainly  to  property,  after the riots) the City of Cardiff Corporation paid out about £4000. But in terms of  damage done to race relations in the area, the effects of the riots were incalculable.

In  effect,  the  black  community  was  placed  in  a  precarious  position. Their  sense  of  oppression  was  compounded  by  the  fact  that  some  1500 Blacks were unemployed. With little or no income, in this maritime setting, they were caught, as it were, between destitution and the deep blue sea. In desperation, some applied to the government to be repatriated. Needless to say,  such  moves  by  Blacks  were  most  welcome  by  the  large  majority  of Whites  who  viewed  the  sensitive  question  of  racial  mixture  with  'an awakened conscience'.

While the idea of getting rid of Blacks was uppermost in the minds of the  townspeople,  there  were  serious  difficulties  in  the  way  of  effecting repatriation. For one thing, family ties among black people were particularly  strong  and  could  not  be  easily  disengaged  in  the  event  of separation. Then there were the strong protests of the keepers of boarding houses to whom  payments for rents already in arrears were not forthcoming. The black lodgers and tenants were in great debt. Since their

employment  ended  they  had  been  indebted  to  their  landlords  who  had virtually kept them since the Armistice. The real prospect of ejection by the boarding house keepers was not a welcome prospect for the Blacks or the local authorities. The situation was allowed to persist to this hopeless stage before  a  partial  settlement  was  revealed.  On  the  one  hand,  the  boarding house keepers were assisted by an official grant, while those Blacks who had not established an English domicile were repatriated. Thus, the black community, echoing a past experience, remained persecuted and depressed.

To a large extent, the misfortunes of the British shipping industry were reflected in the black communities  in  British  ports. Cardiff was  no exception during the period between 1921 and 1938. Foreign competition adversely  affected  British  shipping,  resulting  in  falling  profits  and  high unemployment. This economic depression brought human misery and social tension  between  black  and  white  seamen  who  competed  for  a  steadily diminishing number of jobs. But to compound the problem of unemployment,  the  shipping  industry  was  only  one  area  affected  by  a general  slump  in  world  trade.  As  it  was,  unemployment  among  seamen coincided with that of other occupations (particularly manual ones) which made industrial migration among seamen virtually impossible. For example, one possible outlet, the South Wales coalfields, in which a number of  black  men  had  previously  worked, was also suffering from an unusual state of inactivity.

Unemployment in the steam coal valleys was paralleled by depression in  Cardiff. 35 In  the  struggle  for  employment  in  these  circumstances,  the white majority possessed a clear advantage over the alien black minority. The black seaman's position in the port of Cardiff was worsened by the fact that 'The only course open to British shipowners remaining in the market was to keep down labour costs as low as possible, and coloured firemen and stokers,  provided  they  could  be  signed  on  abroad,  were  considerably cheaper than white seamen.' 36

Whether resident or domiciled in Britain, the black seaman was caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, he was not wanted by the shipowners and employers, while on the other, he was discriminated against by the white unions  who  viewed  him  conveniently  'not  as  a  section  of  the  same labouring class  striving  for  a  livelihood  on  exactly  the  same  basis  as  any other union member, but as the representative of an altogether different and

competitive  category,  which  directly  or  indirectly  was  responsible  for keeping  white  seamen  out  of  work,  and  forcing  down  their  standards  of living'. 37

This  was  the  union's  attitude  for  many  years  during  which  relations between white and black seamen became more embittered. The racial bias of the trade unions would become more starkly evident in later years with the growth of Britain's black working class.

There  were  political  repercussions  in  the  dispute.  The  struggle  by  the unions and their spokesmen was taken both inside and outside the House of Commons.  The  battle  which  began  in  February  1919  and  continued throughout the depression altered little from the original points. The basic argument took the form of a complaint from Neil Maclean MP to the effect that the British crew of the liner Malancha had been paid-off in favour of an Asiatic one. For example, in the old crew the British chief cook was paid £20 per month, the Asiatic one was taken on at £5 per month. This case, typical  of  many  others,  illustrated  one  of  the  gaps  left  by  the  National Maritime Board machinery.

The Labour or opposition representatives' role politically was to direct the  government's  attention  to  three  points.  Firstly,  the  number  of  alien workers  employed  in  the  industry;  secondly,  the  displacement  of  British seamen by black crews; and thirdly, to suggest various legislative measures of correction, through the employment of additional British seamen or by a rise in black seamen's wages. The government's response on these matters were firstly, that the amount of alien labour of the British Empire (though non-European)  was  very  small  indeed;  secondly  it  was  not  policy  to discriminate  between  British  subjects;  and  thirdly  that  as  an  industrial matter, it was best left for employers and unions to decide.

On  the  question  of  'British  subjects',  Dr  Burgin,  a  parliamentary secretary,  felt  that  a  large  percentage  of  black  men  were  British  subjects, and that it would be a long time before any attempt was made to examine British nationality and put it into grades and classifications. He added, 'It is no  good  talking  about  the  brotherhood  of  man  and  suggest  that  there  is some  difference  between  a  white  British  subject  and  a  coloured  British subject.' 38 To this, Mr Greenwood interjected, 'a difference in wages'.

In  their  attempts  to  discredit  black  labour,  the  pro-white  labour  lobby put forward additional reasons for the elimination of black labour such as

moral undesirability of its presence in Britain and its cost to the taxpayer. Given the dearth of statistics, government officials, in an effort to provide exact figures of the number of black seamen, laboured vainly. According to one source in 1919, there were about 5000 black seamen in Cardiff. It had already become clear that black labour had to be controlled, contained and disciplined,  if  not  removed  entirely  to  suit  the  changed  requirements  of British capital.

## Legislation and its application

It  is  within  the  context  of  the  many  complaints  and  popular  debates  that legislation  such  as  the Alien's  Order  of  1920  and  the  Special  Restriction (Coloured Alien Seamen) Order of 1925 should be seen. The SRCASO was, in  effect,  the  enforcement  of  the  earlier  Alien  Restriction  Act  of  1914, designed to keep aliens resident in Britain, under supervision. The object of the Aliens Order of 1920 was to restrict alien immigration, except in cases where they could support themselves and their families.

The main thrust of the Order lay in the power invested in the police to arrest  aliens  without  warrant,  and  to  close  certain  clubs  and  restaurants. Moreover, the Act was to place on the Alien an obligation to register with the  police  and  obtain  a  registration  certificate  which  the  police  could demand to be shown. Separate articles provided also that every alien should be in possession of a passport furnished with a photograph and duly issued not more than five years before the date of arrival or some other document establishing his identity and nationality.

The Order of 1925 was essentially concerned with checking the flow of alien  seamen  into  Britain.  In  certain  cases  its  effects  were  more  farreaching.  In  short,  black  seamen  were  categorised  with  other  aliens,  thus forcing  their  registration  in  accordance  with  provisions  in  the  Order  of 1920.  The  crucial  feature  of  the  Order  of  1925  was  its  application  to  all black  seamen  in  Cardiff  obliging  them,  irrespective  of  nationality  and domicile, to register with the police. In effect, this meant that alien seamen who wanted to be domiciled in Britain had to both prove their nationality and carry around a registration card. Further, the real intention behind the Order  lay  in  the  fact  that  in  Cardiff  the  onus  was  on  all  non-white individuals  to  do  the  same.  This  meant  that  an  alien  who  had  been  in Cardiff before 1925, and in possession of a registration certificate from the police, was in fact better-off than the black British subject who could not

prove  his  identity  by  documentary  proof.  Indeed  a  number  of  the  men involved  came  from  districts  or  tribes  in  colonial  countries  where  few,  if any, could write, and where there was no system of registration. Inability to prove one's identity led to a passport being almost invariably refused by a prejudiced  examiner.  (And  who  could  be  certain  it  was  not  policy  that colour  prejudice  should  lurk  among  officials  in  the  immigration  and passport offices?) In such cases, the black person was categorised an alien and could only be granted a certificate if he could prove residence in Britain before the Order was issued. Given his status as an alien then, he was liable to deportation at any time. Ironically, in this position he was able to make a small  gain  over  the  passport  holder  in  terms  of  employment.  And  what precious little employment!

The  position  of  passport-holding  British  subjects  left  much  to  be desired.  For  if  such  a  passport  expired  during  a  voyage,  it  could  be withdrawn,  and  the  person  not  allowed  to  land  in  Britain.  His  employer would then have to bear the expense of transporting him back to his own country or any other that would accept him or her. As it was, a large number of alien black seamen in Cardiff had evidence of nationality such as British passports, birth certificates, army and naval discharges from the First World War. Yet  they  were  harrassed  by  the  police  who  zealously  tried  to  make them register. If a man refused to produce a passport on demand, he was threatened with arrest and imprisonment. One cannot discount the pervasive effects of personal prejudices in these circumstances.

If there was confusion among some officials, it was clear that much of what was said and interpreted to Blacks was designed to mislead. The West Indian section of the community was told quite simply that the Act did not affect  them  at  all  but  was  aimed  at  the Arabs.  Under  this  falsehood,  the trusting West Indians willingly registered. Others were led to believe that registration was  no  more  than  a  mere  formality  which  automatically affected every seaman. With little to argue against (given these assurances) Blacks were victimised. So convinced were they that their status as British subjects would not be affected by the procedure that the few who had, until then,  managed  to  escape  detection,  voluntarily  registered  as  aliens,  to  be sure they were on the side of the law. In extreme cases, not surprisingly, the police  pushed  black  seamen  to  compulsory  registration.  And  very  often under threats to with-hold payment of wages, black men were compelled to accept Aliens  Cards  at  the  end  of  a  voyage. According  to  a  report  of  an

inquiry carried out by the League of Coloured Peoples, in the majority of cases,  the  shipowners  adopted  the  policy  of  acting  in  concert  with  the police,  using  refusal  to  pay  a  black  seaman  until  he  produced  an Alien's Certificate of Repatriation. 39

In the witch hunt, black men in Cardiff had no means of asserting their British nationality. Ignoring the malpractices contributing to the injustices perpetrated on the black community, the Home Secretary played it safe. He supported various kinds of police actions by taking a legal line. In instances where  passports  were  out  of  date  (or  otherwise  invalid)  the  holder  was advised  to  register,  if  he  had  no  satisfactory  proof  of  his  identity  or nationality. The Home Secretary felt the marking of registration certificates with the word 'seaman' would be enough to distinguish holders from those persons possessing certificates issued under the ordinary provisions of the Aliens Order.

Thus, the alienated Blacks became a moral problem. More pressure was exerted against the black community in Cardiff. One of the main sources of this pressure came from the trade unions, who were supposedly defenders of the poor and oppressed working man and the wider economic and social context within which they operated. Indeed the unions were the mainspring of  the  legislative  measures  designed  to  contain  and  harass  the  black community.

The League of Coloured Peoples maintained that the decision to employ white labour exclusively in the shipping industry of Great Britain was not arrived  at  suddenly  or  with  undue  haste.  It  was  the  outcome  of  a  mature consideration of the trend of certain  events  intimately  connected  with  the shipping industry. Clearly, the plan of having these men registered as aliens was devised and put into operation by legislative measures enacted through the influence of the trade unions and other labour organisations. 40

Given a crippled shipping industry and consequent rising unemployment  which  by  1931-3  was  one  out  of  every  three  registered seamen  in Britain, there was  little sympathy  for the isolated black community. So far as local conditions at Newport, Cardiff, Penarth, Barry and Swansea were concerned, in 1930, 41.4 per cent of the insured seamen were  unemployed,  and  in  December  1937  (two  years  after  the  Shipping Assistance Act) there were still 32.3 per cent unemployed. 41

Economic decline found its scapegoat in the depression of  the  1930s, and  the  replacement  of  white  seamen  by  Lascars  over  tropical  routes, helped little.

Anger over practices favouring Blacks awakened righteous indignation on 'moral' problems arising from the presence of black men in the ports. The muckraking that ensued invoked many distortions and prejudices. The Home Secretary's attention was drawn to the alleged dependence of black children on the Public Assistance Committee, not only in Cardiff but also in Swansea and Liverpool. Almost as if Blacks who constituted the 'Aliens' group were synonymous with sedition, he was asked to close loopholes in regard  to  aliens  (communists  and  anarchist  leaders  from  Spain)  from entering  Britain. 42 Indeed  the  wider  implications  of  the  'problem'  was  a source of great concern for the local councils. The 'fairly general consensus of  opinion'  was  that  the  increasing  size  of  the  problem  was  the  result  of 'certain laxities in the regulations governing supervision and control of the licensed  houses  and  cafes  in  the  dock  area'.  The  Report  of  the  Special Watch  Committee  records  the  following  resolution:  'That  in  view  of  the grave social evils resulting from the presence in the ports of this country of large  communities  of  coloured  seamen,  HM  Government  be  urged  to promote legislation to deal with the matter …' 43

Similarly, a few months later at a joint conference of the British social Hygiene Council and the British Council for the Welfare of the Merchant Marine, it was decided to draw the attention of the government to the fact that  in  view  of  the  increase  in  the  number  of  half-caste  children  in  the seaport towns, and of the future difficulty of finding employment for sons and  daughters  of  black  seamen  who  visit  these  shores,  the  government should  immediately  take  steps  to  enquire  into  the  problem  in  order  to mitigate  the  evil.  Furthermore,  the  Chief  Constable  of  Cardiff  urged  the government  to  support  the  recommendations  of  a  report  of  the  Watch Committee which he was convinced would 'have the effect of abolishing the undesirable cafes which form the cloak for the conduct which gives rise to the greater problem  of the half-caste children. Nothing  short of legislative  action  will  deal  with  this  part  of  the  problem,  and  it  is  a responsibility which the Legislature will sooner or later have to face.' 44

In the storm of protest, however, it became evident that the dependence of black children on public assistance was not only the result of the poverty

of the households to which they belonged, but also to a general prejudice against  employing  them  'in  virtually  any  sphere  but  seafaring'. 45 Things had  changed  little  since  the  first  black  seamen  settled  in  Cardiff.  Their children were regarded as social outcasts. As the Cardiff Juvenile Employment Committee emphasised: 'It is a very sad commentary on the Christian spirit shown, and indicates that the colour Bar is still very strong in this country.' 46

The  setting-up  of  special  sub-committees  had  no  real  effect  on  the gloomy  prospects.  Although  there  was  an  increase  in  existing  social activities, finding work for the children of both sexes, more particularly the half-caste girls, remained a difficult problem. A more extensive inquiry into 'the  colour  problem  in  the  ports'  of  Britain  produced  evidence  to  support the  above  finding  on  employment.  In  Liverpool  also  the  prospects  of employment for black juveniles were poor. Having written to 119 firms in that city, an inquirer received no reply from 63, and negative replies from 45. 47 In  addition,  similar  letters  were  sent  to  employers  of  domestic servants,  with  the  result  that  very  few  women  were  willing  to  make  the experiment  of  engaging  coloured  girls.  In  contrast  to  this  situation,  the Juvenile Employment Officer stated that about 50 per cent of the white boys applying from this area were eventually placed and openings for white girls from  the  district  where  most  of  the  black  people  lived  were  'distinctly good'.

But  what  were  the  possibilities  of  shore  labour  for  adult  black  men? Nineteen 'appropriate' firms were circularised. Out of the 17 which replied, 13 did not employ any black men and had never done so; two had done so during  the  war,  but  had  replaced  them  with  white  labour  when  this  was available.  Only  two  employed  'Negroes'  and  these  had  only  eleven  black employees  between  them. 48   Predictably,  the  report  was  met  with  a  good deal of hostility from the black community.

A further source of pressure on the black community was the effect of the Shipping Act. Through the British Shipping (Assistance) Act of 1935, the government provided a compromise by which shipowners and seamen were to be subsidised at the taxpayer's expense. The purpose of the Act was to enable the tramp owner to meet foreign competition, and by limitation of shipping  to  raise  freight  rates.  The  shipowners  were  to  scrap  'surplus tonnage'  and  in  return  the  government  would  grant  them  a  number  of

subsidies, amounting in all to £2 million. Trouble began when two ships of the Tatham Shipping Line (which had previously employed all black crews of  Malays  on  deck  and  West  Indians  and Africans  below)  changed  their policy. They refused to employ men who could not identify themselves, in spite of the fact that a Board of Trade official was willing to grant passes to anyone brought to him by the captain who had a continuous discharge book. The trade unions' position in the circumstances was most interesting. The local union officials felt that shipowners had a right to sign on whom they wished. Previously the 'donkeyman', a West Indian, had always picked the crew. This time, he did the same and took them to Barry to sign on. The Shipping Federation Officer (representing the owners) asked each man for his birth certificate or passport and if unable to show these the men were not signed on. The ship was delayed for a day in order to get in touch with the  superintendent  of  the  company,  whose  reply  was  that  these  were owners' orders  and  must  be  carried  out.  In  the  meantime,  a  sister  ship  at Cardiff  which  had  signed  on  two  Malay  sailors  brought  them  ashore  two days  later  and  paid  them  off  with  a  month's  wages.  They  were  told  they could  not  sail  without  passports.  The  matter  was  solved  that  afternoon, however, when the Company signed-on a black crew without passports, and the ship sailed. 49

These industrial developments on the docks led to more political debate. In  the  House  of  Commons,  Mr  Greenwood  rejoiced  to  hear  that  alien seamen would not be given places on British ships. Another Labour MP, Mr West, mounted a strong attack on Chinese, Lascars and black seamen, as a whole. In the mounting tension at the port, union officials intervened. By opposing  the  employment  of  black  seamen,  a  serious  disturbance  at  the docks  was  averted.  The  ship  involved  was  the SS  Ethel  Radcliffe which through the intervention of the League of Coloured Peoples, the Chairman of the Tramp  Shipping  Administrative Committee  and  the Shipping Company, eventually sailed with black seamen on board. In the daily press, under the headline 'Cardiff Colour Bar Causes Riot', the incident was seen as having 'averted serious rioting' between black and white seamen. 50

The  black  seamen  were  alarmed  and  with  good  reason.  The  events which  followed  had  drastic  effects.  Many  hundreds  of  families  lost  their only means of livelihood. One gets an idea of the enormity of the problem from the fact that by 11 June 1936, from a total of 690 unemployed firemen on the Cardiff Docks Register, 599 were black men. In the face of common

difficulties, to a large extent, religious and other differences were superseded  by  a feeling of solidarity among  the  various  groups.  A community was formed representing Africans, West Indians, Arabs, Somalis and  Malays.  This  organisation,  called  the  Coloured  Seamen's  Union, delegated one of its representatives, H. O. O'Connell to seek assistance for their cause in London. The assistance received was that of an inquiry into the vexed question of naturalisation. O'Connell also received the help of the League  of  Coloured  Peoples  and  members  of  the  House  of  Commons. Commenting  on  the  government's  rearmament  proposals  in  1935,  Mr Maxton pointed out that in the case of the black seamen, their rights and liberties  as  subjects  of  the  British  Empire  had  been  usurped  rather  than defended.

The inquiry studied 35 extreme cases in an attempt to prove misapplication of the Special Restriction Order. Of the 12 cases brought to the attention of the Secretary, seven men had their national status restored. At the time, the Order forced some 1500 men to carry the Aliens Card with them. In the subsequent readjustment between 1935 and 1937 approximately 1600 names were removed from the 'Live Register' (a term used  to  indicate  the  active  register  which  contained  the  names  of  black seamen  either  at  sea  or  ashore,  at  the  time  it  was  taken).  Of  these,  the majority had their national status restored to them. 51

## The role of the white unions

The trade union rhetoric of the 'brotherhood of man' had little bearing on the situation. Indeed, the role of the white unions was invidious as the black seamen  were  attacked  from  all quarters. The  Aliens' Order  and  its consequences  had  the  support  of  the  trade  unions.  Yet,  in  the  serious conflict of interests which arose the National Union of Seamen argued that far from wishing to dispose of the British-born black men (or at any rate the West  Indians  and  Africans)  they  were  actually  fighting  their  battles.  In support  of  this  argument,  they  cited  their  recommendation  drawn  up  in conjunction with the Transport and General Workers' Union (prepared for the  Trades  Union  Parliamentary  Committee)  on  the  question  of  shipping subsidies  and  the  conditions  of  seamen  against  domiciled  British  crews. This joint trade union memorandum stated:

No  government  assistance  of  any  kind  should  be  given  to  those shipowners  who  are  now  making  a  practice  of  employing  alien crews for their vessels, to the exclusion of domiciled British crews. It  should  therefore  be  a  condition  of  any  subsidy  or  other  form  of assistance that the crews of the vessels concerned should be entirely manned by domiciled British seamen.

If indeed, the word 'British' conveyed to the ordinary working man in Britain  only  white  citizens  of  the  British  Empire,  then  it  was  possible  to blame  this  interpretation  for  the  misunderstanding.  But,  if  this  was  a genuine  misunderstanding  the  union's  own  report  helped  to  foster  it.  The Seaman , the official journal of the National Union of Seamen, admitted that union officials and other white members of labour organisations had made too much of the employment of aliens. 52

Racial prejudice was the determining factor at the Cardiff Docks. For regardless of the views of the problem taken at union headquarters, a few of the local officials exploited to the full the opportunity to encourage black repatriation. They aroused public animosity by citing the argument of the black  community's  expense  to  the  public  rates.  In  this  connection,  the Western Mail and South Wales Echo reported that George Reed, secretary of the  local  branch  of  the  NUS,  said  thousands  of  imported  black  men  had unrestricted  entry  into  Cardiff.  He  had  no  doubt  that  if  these  men  were going to be displaced they should be repatriated.

## The black community: struggle for survival

Clearly,  the  depressed  community,  precariously  placed  on  the  Cardiff Docks,  was  being  pushed  further  to  the  edge.  As  the  Second  Industrial Report pointed out, the community had undergone severe hardship. In fact, the  history  of  Blacks  in  Cardiff  hitherto,  was  essentially  one  of  hardship. The  League  of  Coloured  Peoples  estimated  that  about  80  per  cent  of  the men had been on unemployment benefit during most of the year from April 1934 to April 1935. More strikingly, their home life had reached the level of bare subsistence.

While  social  development  and  cultural  advancement  were  almost  nil, even  church  attendance  was  denied  one  family,  whose  black  father  and brown  children  were  not  welcome.  Moreover,  secondary  education  and industrial employment were practically closed to them, essentially because

the sentiment of the city was to reject and restrict the 'half-castes'. In fact, a Cardiff public official was accused of calling for legislation to 'put a stop to the breeding of such children'.

In  effect  the  1935-6  trouble  aggravated  an  already  chronic  condition within the black community. How did black people manage to live? Seen in perspective, a large number  of  men  were  continuously  unemployed. Inevitably, their unemployment benefit, quickly spent, forced them to rely on the  Relieving  Officer  for  support.  In  1930,  relief  of  5 s per  person  per week was granted to about 250 Arabs and 300 Somali seamen and firemen, whose destitution during the shipping depression had brought their boarding house keepers to the end of their resources. The payments were made direct to the  boarding  house  masters,  to  cover  the  bare  cost  of  food.  The proprietors  were  willing  to  continue  to  provide  lodgings.  In  fact,  they approached the Public Assistance Committee and undertook to remove the Arab  seamen  from  chargeability,  if  the  Committee  would  take  no  further action to deport them. The Committee agreed and the relief was discontinued.

The impoverished position of the black community during this period was to  some  extent  reflected  in  these  out-relief  payments.  On  the  pretext that Blacks were accustomed to a lower standard of living than their white workmates in the trade, the grants were adjusted accordingly. Indeed, the same practice was adopted when the Unemployment Assistance Board was set up. This meant that instead of the basic allowance of 15 . per week for a s man living alone, a payment of 12 . per week was made to those judged to s be  living  'communally',  for  example,  those  sharing  a  'communal  pot'. 53 Differentiation  had  its  special  difficulties,  and  not  surprisingly,  became  a source  of  dissatisfaction  among  members  of  the  black  community.  They particularly  resented  the  implication  that  because  a  black  man  necessarily had to live more cheaply his needs were less great. It was pointed out that the benefit was barely sufficient.

Moreover, it was argued that in practice, a differential scale was adopted not  only  between  white  and  black,  but  also  between  the  various  black nationalities themselves. This was designed to set Blacks against each other and, of course, it was possible that differently scaled payments were made according to the circumstances of the case, but there was no evidence which indicated that the principle of adjustment  was  extended  in  the  way suggested.  Thus,  it  was  regarded  as  an  illustration  of  the  working  of  the

'racial myth'. Nevertheless, the policy of adjustment was approved by the Minister of Health. Justifying their relief programme, the Cardiff authorities claimed  that  'their  treatment  was  more  generous  than  that  of  most  other ports'. In fact, a large number of seaports refused to grant outdoor relief at all, and offered only institutional relief. Ravaged by poverty, many fought for  their  self-respect  and  dignity.  In  South  Shields,  for  example,  it  was claimed  that  after  a  few  days  in  the  Institution,  the  seamen  took  their discharge and did not seek further assistance there.

In  the  wake  of  the  'riots'  and  the  shipping  depression  then,  the  black community had become a 'problem', paradoxically arousing 'censure' and the 'curiosity of social investigations'. The weight of opinion was against Blacks. Social investigators and the media were uninhibited in displaying their  prejudices.  Black/white sexual relations and half-caste children were haunting  themes.  Immorality,  they  agreed,  was  endemic  in  the  black community. Richardson's report, for example, quoted in the Western Mail and the South Wales News , alerted the people of Cardiff:

Morality and cleanliness are as much matters of geography as they are dependent on circumstances. The coloured men who have come to  dwell  in  our  cities  are  being  made  to  adopt  a  standard  of civilisation  they  cannot  be  expected  to  understand.  They  are  not imbued  with  moral  codes  similar  to  our  own,  and  they  have  not assimilated our conventions of life. They come into intimate contact with white women, principally those who unfortunately are of loose moral  character  with  the  result  that  a  half-caste  population  is brought into the world. 54

Furthermore, he emphasised hybridisation and disease which helped matters little in a city which had openly showed its hatred for its alien guests. And according to the Western Mail , 'The problem of the coloured population in our seaport towns … demands immediate government action.' For not only the  social  amenities  of  the  white  man's  country,  but  the  best  interest  of black  people  themselves  were  at  issue.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  'many  of them are citizens  of  the  British  Empire;  many  did  fine  work  in  the  war', there was  no  room  for 'sentimentality' in the matter. For although 'Repatriation may involve hardships, and it is our obligation to make it easy for them to return to their homelands, where we will continue to carry the

'White man's burden'? The newspaper concluded emphatically, 'We can no longer tolerate that burden on our doorstep.' 55

This  attack  and  government  apathy  (although  a  few  white  residents wrote letters describing the report as misleading) led to a 'mild revulsion' in popular attitudes towards black people. The black community was not quick to  react  violently,  but  remained  spirited.  Visitors  to  the  community  found that black people were 'patient and peaceful in the face of their difficulties'. A Daily Express journalist on a tour of British cities commented on the lack of opportunity and the degree of colour prejudice in Cardiff. 56 In  spite  of the obvious problems confronting them, there was little public sympathy for black people in the distressed area.

Yet, given the experience of unemployment in their country of origin, and  in  spite  of  the  onslaught  against  them,  many  black  people  in  Cardiff still had an unshakeable belief in their rights as British nationals. Repatriation for the majority was impracticable. Indeed, some of the older men had 'grown into the place', having settled in Cardiff for 30 and in some cases  for  40  years.  Their  'determination  to  persist  was  generally  evident, and  the  sentiment  of  local  association  seems  to  be  amongst  the  strongest psychological characteristics which the younger generation have acquired'. 57

In sum this was the background of the black experience in Cardiff until the  Second World War. In historical  perspective,  the  experience  had  been shared (to a greater or lesser degree) by other black communities in Britain. Significantly,  in  economic  terms,  in  some  ways,  it  had  similarities  with white  workers  of  the  same  occupational  class. The  colour  bar  has  been  a general  feature  of  the  larger  ports. And  more  often  than  not,  Blacks  had been pushed and confined in the slums of the towns, as a direct result of the policies  and  practices  of  the  British  government,  and  the  racism  of  the employers and the trade unions. In Liverpool, as in London, there were race riots at the end of the First World War. Discrimination against black seamen had become widespread. What characterised Cardiff from other ports was that concentration of black families in one small area of the town resulted in 'the  creation  of  a  special  focus  of  prejudice,  broken  up  only  by  rather sporadic attempts at amelioration'.

If  peace  had  brought  unemployment,  poverty,  prejudice,  violence  and desperation to the black community, the prospects of the Second World War

offered the hope that at least things could not get much worse. Hitler could not be as menacing as the race-hate that Blacks were faced with in Cardiff.

## Liverpool: 'negro' workers and race relations

The  old  slave  port  of  Liverpool  has  had  a  continuous  black  presence; stretching  from  the  period  of  slavery  into  the  twentieth  century.  Between the World Wars, there was a small black population in Liverpool. This black presence  had  conditioned  the  attitude  of  white  people  in  the  city  who responded accordingly to the new arrivals. Liverpool had grown enormously  as  a  result  of  migration  from  other  ports  in  England,  from Wales, Ireland and from overseas. In spite of a diverse racial mix, the city had  acquired  a  distinctive  Merseyside  character  and  mode  of  speech. During  the  period  1941-51,  however,  there  had  been  clearly  marked  ingroup/  out-group  divisions.  Nationality  and  religion  divided  people  in Liverpool.  The  Irish  and  Welsh,  for  example,  displayed  a  high  degree  of national  consciousness.  In  fact,  there  had  been  outbreaks  of  antagonisms between such groups as Protestants and Catholics, and outbreaks of feelings of anti-semitism.

Given this complexity of inter-group relations in Liverpool, the arrival of  increasing  numbers  of  black  immigrants  to  join  the  indigenous  black settlement after 1918 added a new dimension. While the number of black people  was  not  large,  they  were  nonetheless,  highly  visible,  even  though one  estimate  before  the  Second  World  War  put  the  Chinese  and  'Negro' populations at just over one in a thousand of the total population. 58 In time, 'African'  immigrants  came  to  be  regarded  with  suspicion  and  hostility, particularly after being discharged from the armed forces and the Merchant Navy in  1919. Antagonism  between  Blacks  and  Whites  grew. And,  as  in Cardiff  about  this  time,  serious  disturbances  broke  out.  In  the  aftermath, public opinion was in favour of the repatriation of Blacks to the colonies. In fact, many (in the face of impoverishment and racial discrimination) were persuaded to return to their homelands. Others, however, adamant in spite of hardship, demanded their rights as British subjects to live in Britain. In spite  of  the  Blacks'  minority  status  in  Liverpool,  they  were  nevertheless seen as a threat by the white population, particularly in terms of competition for  employment.  This  threat  led  to  stereotyped  opinions  of  black  people. Not surprisingly,  then,  attempts  were  made  to  prevent  the  further  flow  of

'Negro'  immigrants  into  Liverpool  and  to  discourage  the  employment  of black  labour  on  British  ships. 59 Fortunately  for  racist  decision-makers,  it seemed essential economic factors were significant in preventing this policy from being implemented.

Nonetheless, 'Negroes' faced prejudice daily. With  these massive disadvantages,  the  'Negro's  difficulties  were  compounded  by  the  high unemployment  in  Liverpool  between  the  wars.  Unemployment  made  the absorption  process  of  the  newcomers  a  very  difficult  one  given  the economic insecurity on Merseyside.

Historically, Merseyside is characterised by its dependence upon overseas  trade.  The  predominant  industries  contributing  to  its  prosperity have been those connected with shipping, shipbuilding and transport. In the wake of the First World War, the area suffered from the severe effects of the depressions of the 1920s and 1930s. The casual labour system on the docks aggravated  local  unemployment  which  figured  among  the  largest  in  the country. The social tensions generated led to unrest. 60 The understandable widespread feelings of insecurity aroused by the unemployment  on Merseyside during the 1930s were related to the severe competition for a limited  number of jobs.  Nevertheless,  by  the  1930s  the  black  worker  had advanced marginally in that West Indians had become employed in English factories  doing  skilled  work  on  a  par  with  English  workers  in  a  working relationship  that  would  have  been  unthinkable  in  the  pre-war  period. Nonetheless, black workers were usually the last hired and the first fired.

The onset of the war, however, brought a change in their position. The existing unemployment was quickly eliminated in Merseyside, and in other areas of the country. The 'enemy' brought work for black seamen who were urgently required to man the Atlantic convoys, as workers for the Merchant Navy. Although  they  received  the  same  rates  of  pay,  black  workers  were still restricted to certain ranks in the merchant service.

Industry was also affected as workers of all grades, regardless of colour, were in demand. The war demand for munitions led not only to the building of  many  factories  (concentrating  on  war  production)  but  also  to  a  great demand  for  skilled  workers.  It  was  this  emergency  development  which influenced the Ministry of Labour  to direct skilled labour into the Merseyside area. Some of these workers were refugees from Europe, others were  the  West  Indian  volunteers.  Once  again,  in  wartime,  the  British

authorities had devised a plan through which they could exploit their labour needs.

## The wartime immigration scheme for West Indian workers

Against the backdrop of war, West Indians came to Britain under a scheme organised jointly by the Ministry of Labour and the Colonial Office, with the  object  of  increasing  war  production. And  to  legitimise  it,  the  scheme was  regarded as making  a small contribution towards relieving the unemployment in the colonies. 61

In the West Indies, men and women ravaged by poverty were eager to offer  their services  almost  at  any  price,  to  help  the  mother  country, regardless  of  the  fact  that  black  soldiers  had  bitter  experiences  of  racial prejudice in the British forces during the First World War. Although there were  few  openings  in  the  armed  forces,  at  the  time,  it  was  felt  that  the colonies could be called upon to help in filling the urgent need for skilled workers in the factories. The presence of black workers in Merseyside, over a long period of time, led to a policy of employing most West Indians in this area.

In Liverpool, these volunteer workers were selected by the authorities in the West Indies and provided with a passage to England and the guarantee of  free  passage  home  again  at  the  end  of  the  war.  From  this  statement,  it seemed quite clear that if these black workers were lucky enough to be alive after the war, they would be favoured with the 'guarantee of a free passage home'.

They arrived in England in 11 separate contingents: five from Jamaica, the rest from British Honduras, the Bahamas, Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands. The first three contingents from Jamaica  were  technicians  who  had  training  and  experience  on  the  island. The men from the other contingent, despite their 'experience' in the West Indies,  were  relatively  unskilled  on  arrival,  and  were  sent  to  one  of  the Government Training Centres where they received basic training in certain aspects of engineering before being placed in the factories as semi-skilled workers.  It  was  not  long  before  all  the  men  were  either  skilled  or  semiskilled. At the outset of the scheme, it was recognised that special welfare provision had to be made for these workers. 62

The Ministry of Labour did in fact make special arrangements and the men were put under the charge of a Welfare Officer and his assistant. The

man appointed to take charge of the scheme as a whole had previously been involved  in  an  inquiry  in  1940  into  alleged  discrimination  against  black British subjects in this department. Faced with racial prejudice, the Ministry of Labour had set the pace in pointing the way to the employers by refusing to  allow  prejudice  to  influence  the  appointment  of  the  best  qualified  men for the job, regardless of their colour. Officially, there was a strong desire to make  the  scheme  work.  Naturally,  black  workers  turned  to  the  Welfare Officer for advice and assistance whenever any difficulty occurred particularly on matters of colour prejudice and discrimination. Overseeing the  Scheme  were  officials  from  the  International  Labour  Office  and  the Colonial Office who paid periodic 'visits of inspection'.

Among the West Indian technicians and trainees, diversity was the most outstanding characteristic. Their backgrounds reflected varying educational qualifications  and  skill.  However,  determination  among  them  was  not lacking.  They  were  employed  primarily  under  six  headings:  engineering (skilled),  engineering  (semiskilled),  electrical  trades  (skilled),  electrical trades (semi-skilled), building, and civil engineering. Those who could not be so trained, were classified as clerical and miscellaneous grades.

## Discrimination in the employment of 'Negroes'

The  arrival  of  these  West  Indian  workers  must  be  seen  in  the  context  of discrimination against black people in British industry which was widespread before the Second World War. In spite of the fact that the state of full employment reached by 1940 had created an enormous demand for labour,  there  was  strong  resistance  to  the  employment  of  Blacks  among employers. Despite this resistance among several firms, demand for labour at that time far outweighed the supply. Consequently, in spite of prejudiced employers, black workers were able to find employment, primarily in the public sector. Indeed, in time, the mass of black workers were condemned to  these  low status jobs, essentially because black labour was regarded as cheap, disposable, and as such could not be unduly resisted.

Given  the  intransigence  of  employers,  some  form  of  labour  direction was  necessary.  In  Britain,  during  the  war,  the  Ministry  of  Labour  in directing  black  labour,  provided  one  measure  (the  Essential  Works  and Control of Engagements Orders) to be used if necessary against employers who discriminated against Blacks. Essentially, these Orders were introduced  to  deal  with  the  urgent  manpower  shortage  in  general  and,

according  to  one  observer,  'were  not  drafted  with  Negroes  or  any  other minority group in mind'. This may have been true, but difficult to believe particularly  in  view  of  the  fact  that  these  Orders  did  assist  Ministry  of Labour Officials in dealing with discriminating employers.

Armed with these powers for the duration of the war, West Indians were kept  fully  employed.  In  fact,  unemployment  and  discrimination  were  not serious problems between 1941 and 1945.

## Pay and conditions

In  the  employment of black workers in industry, the questions of rates of pay and working conditions were vital. Payment at less than the standard rates would have raised serious objections from the trade unions. The West Indian  technicians  and  trainees,  sensitive  to  the  demands  of  the  trade unions,  joined  the  following  unions:  the AEU,  UBISS,  ETU,  NUSMWB, ASW, NUPGDE, TGWU, and NUGMW. 63  As it was, no attempt was made to  undercut  wages.  Indeed,  it  was  the  cornerstone  of  the  official  Scheme that the black workers should receive no less than the standard rates paid to English workers. In fact,  this  was  agreed  by  the  men  before  they  left  the colonies. Subsequently, the disputes concerning wage rates were attributed to  'misunderstanding'  on  the  part  of  the  West  Indians  rather  than  any deviation from the principle of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.

Given the 'misunderstandings', wage rates remained a source of dispute from  the  outset,  and  throughout  the  operation  of  the  Scheme.  But,  what were these misunderstandings?  And why  the concern about wages? According  to  one  commentator,  the  reasons  were  firstly  that  the  West Indians, like the trade unions, did not wish to be used to undercut standard rates, and secondly, rates of pay were vital in determining satisfaction with working conditions. This was essentially the case when consideration was given to the question of a relative rather than absolute rates of pay. This was crucial  because  wages  were  closely  linked  with  status  in  industry.  This relationship,  underscored  by  the  desire  to  maintain  and  improve  status which  governed  much  of  the  behaviour  of  individuals  and  groups  in industry, was also a cause of much dissatisfaction and anxiety. 64

The outcome of 'hurried negotiations' established a special expatriation allowance of £1 per week per man which would be paid later directly into an account for them in the colony. This gesture was not enough. Bad feeling was aroused by the fact that the equivalent sum paid to an English worker

required to work 'away from home' was £1.4 .6 s d .  It  would  seem  that  the airing of these matters had a beneficial effect. In the months that followed, skilled West Indians were able to earn 'very large wage  packets', particularly  at  the  height  of  the  war  when  they  worked  many  hours  of overtime. Some technicians earned as much as £13 or £14 per week; others earned even more at the peak of the munitions drive. But these abnormal earnings were considerably reduced as the war neared its end. The disparity in earnings was a source of complaint. A more realistic standard of living without overtime was difficult to accept. One of the effects of the loss of overtime earnings was that the men who had saved large sums and made regular remittances to their families at home were unable to do so.

Furthermore,  wage  differentials  presented  a  severe  problem  among  a number  of  trainees  because  of  the  large  differentials  in  the  earnings  of different groups. The highest earnings in certain factories amounted to £10 per week or more for trainees, while for those denied the opportunities of bonuses and overtime, earnings amounted to no more than £5-6 per week. 65 The  arbitrary  allocation  of  the  men  meant  that  these  differences  did  not represent any distribution in merit or skill. Thus, the differentials justifiably aroused deep discontent.

One of the more serious effects of these arbitrary wage differentials was the way it affected morale in the hostels. These differences aggravated the other grievances West Indians had about life in the hostels and also in the way they were treated outside. One form of protest was refusal to pay the outstanding  debts  at  the  hostels.  Under  the  circumstances,  the  practice spread and became chronic.

In  a  foreign  land,  the  West  Indian  workers  (with  families  abroad)  felt alienated;  they  felt  no  sense  of  security  or  community  -  only  an  allpervasive sense of discrimination. However, one researcher has argued that 'The sense of discrimination under which some of the men laboured with regard to wage rates was completely unfounded, [and that] in no case was a West Indian paid less than the agreed trade union rate for the job.' But, he conceded that it was 'more difficult to assess the complaints with regard to aspects  of  working  conditions'. Allegations  from  black  workers  included the  tendency  to  be  selected  for  the  more  unpleasant  jobs,  the  lack  of promotion through seniority and merit, and the tendency to place men in a new shop to get it operative, but when the opportunity arose in their jobs to be upgraded to that of charge-hands or foremen, these men would be moved

to another new shop and the responsible posts would be filled by other men. Taken together, these complaints indicated that the West Indians (whatever the merits of the Scheme) did not always identify with the practices in the factories  where  they  worked,  and,  as  Richmond  admits  'did  sometimes labour under a sense of discrimination and deprivation'.

Before  the  end  of  the  Scheme  in  1946  many  changes  in  employment (the result of trial and error) were introduced. There was greater flexibility between contingents and among different firms. By the end of the Scheme some of the employers had employed one or more West Indians. While in some cases these changes suited individuals, more often than not they were in  accord  with  the  demands  of  the  labour  situation.  But  in  spite  of  the changes,  there  was  stability.  The  hard  facts  were  that  towards  the  end  of 1944,  some  55  out  of  77  technicians  originally  drafted  to  two  Royal Ordinance  Factories  were  still  working  there.  And  in  March  1951,  the remaining ROF (the others having been closed) had 12 of the original West Indian  contingent.  Clearly,  there  was  no  lack  of  commitment.  The  West Indians who arrived in 1941, when the factory was only just beginning to expand, had some of the longest service records in the factory. 66

## Post-war problems: redundancies and loss of earnings

The end of the war had a profound effect on the position of West Indian workers in Britain. They faced an uncertain future. In addition to the loss of overtime  earnings  and  bonus  payments,  redundancies  were  threatened  as white ex-servicemen returned to their homes. The prospects were very poor indeed. By November 1944 'an atmosphere of unsettlement was beginning to show itself amongst technicians and trainees, which was attributed to the termination of the war and repatriation'. 67 The increased war-time earnings meant  that  adjustment  to  basic  wages  created  difficulties,  particularly among those with family responsibilities, high rents and travelling expenses.  Most  of  the  men  knew  only  war-time  Britain  and  continued  to have high expectations. The Welfare Officer's repeated warnings failed to persuade the men to see the post-war situation realistically. Consequently, as their debts mounted, they blamed the authorities.

As expected early  in  1945,  redundancies  grew  and  jobs  for  the  semiskilled  West  Indian  became  a  serious  problem.  In  July,  there  was  further evidence  of  tension.  And  later  in  the  year,  the  WO  reported  that  the relaxation of the provisions of the Essential Works and Control

Engagements  Orders  made  it  difficult  to  get  employers  to  accept  West Indians,  when  vacancies  were  notified.  Relaxation  of  the  Orders  was controversial.  In  fact, the trade unions  had  pressed  strongly  for  this measure. They had accepted 'direction of labour' with the proviso that it be removed  as  soon  as  the  war  had  ended. 68 Moreover,  as  the  election approached, while the government felt it necessary to rescind these Orders, they subsequently reaffirmed them during the economic crisis of 1947.

It  was  clear  that  the  employment  of  black  workers  was  made  more difficult  during  this  period.  In  a  number  of  instances,  a  colour  bar  in employment  was  practised  early  in  1946.  In  the  aftermath  of  war  many employers were determined to keep black workers out.

Elsewhere, in the United States, for example, black workers were also beginning  to  lose  ground,  which  they  had  gained  during  the  war,  and discrimination  was  beginning  to  appear  on  a  larger  scale  again.  By  1946 then,  there  was  still  no  machinery  through  which  a  black  worker  could obtain redress as a victim of discrimination.

## Unemployment

From 1946, unemployment remained a central issue in Liverpool and the Northwest. Unemployment in Merseyside at the end of the war remained 'considerably above the average' for the country as a whole. The policy of setting up new industries in the area did not move at a pace fast enough to compensate for the decline in employment. This decline was stemmed when rearmament started again. Employment at the end of 1951 had reached the 'highest  in  the  post  war  period'.  A  special  count  in  January  1950  and February 1951 showed that there was some 'improvement in the employment  prospects'  of  black  colonials  in  Liverpool. 69 Although  there was  some  improvement  in  the  unemployment  among  semi-skilled  and skilled  West  Indians,  there  was  an  increase  in  unemployment  among  the unskilled.  Among  West  Indians  and  West  Africans,  unemployment  was about 17 per cent in January 1950. The figure in 1951 was approximately 12 per cent. By comparison, the figures for the total working population of Merseyside were 5 per cent declining to between 3 and 4 per cent in 1951. This was above the national average of approximately 1.5 per cent. 70

Discrimination

Overall, there was undeniable evidence that discrimination in employment against  'Negroes'  occurred,  although,  at  the  time,  it  was  not  possible  to quantify its extent and degree. Among the reasons given by employers for their refusal to employ Blacks were essentially a past unfortunate experience and fear of strikes by their present (white) workers as a result. The latter reason was a powerful determinant, for while there had been no instances officially recorded of an industrial dispute involving the employment of Blacks, there were instances of threatened strikes on these grounds.  Needless  to  say,  the  prejudiced  employer  found  this  useful. Unfortunately, it was argued that the irresponsible behaviour of a minority of Blacks tended to reinforce prejudices.

In  the  face  of  these  difficulties  in  employment,  it  was  not  surprising then to find a considerable number of West Indian technicians, trainees and unskilled  workers  leaving  Liverpool  for  other  towns,  particularly  in  the Midlands  and Southeast where  work  was  plentiful.  Accommodation, however, acted as a real deterrent to black workers on the move. Once one or two of them had established themselves in a new town, they searched for accommodation for their colleagues.

Unemployment in Manchester  after  the  war  was  not  as  serious  as  on Merseyside. In March 1949, there were 150 'Coloured Colonials' registered as  unemployed  at  the  Oldham  Street  Exchange.  Of  this  number,  only  26 were West Indian, and of these only seven appeared to have come to Britain under  the  original  Scheme.  The  others  were  discharged  ex-servicemen  or men who paid their way and arrived in Britain during 1948. In Manchester also  there  was  discrimination.  The  Employment  Exchange  confirmed  the unwillingness of employers to accept black workers because of the difficult behaviour of a few of them.

The closure of the colonial hostels at the end of the war resulted in the original  residents  moving  to  Liverpool,  Manchester  and  other  areas.  In Bolton, a new  group of West Indians emerged as private lodgers. Apparently  well-adjusted,  they  were  employed  in  the  cotton  industry  as motor mechanics, motor drivers and labourers. In spite of the fact that there had  been  no  disturbances  since  the  end  of  the  war  (and  given  the  Chief Constable's endorsement of the men's good behaviour) employers were still reluctant  to  employ  black  workers  on  any  large  scale.  This  attitude  was supported by the local trade union officials.

After 1946, the poor employment prospects of Blacks in the Northwestern areas led to a substantial migration to the Midland region. In Birmingham, a small black community amounting to 'a few hundreds' had grown. Here, in the post-war situation, the local authority took an interest in the  welfare  of  the  Blacks  and  set  up  an  Afro-Caribbean  Centre  which provided educational and recreational facilities.

In  the  pottery  districts,  some  Blacks  were  being  accepted  and  a  few found their way into the mining industry. It seemed, in these areas of full employment  and  labour  scarcity,  there  were  few  employment  problems. Accommodation,  however,  remained  a  serious  problem  and  acted  as  a strong deterrent to migration, particularly to those with families.

## West Indian workers, employers and managements

The  relations between  West  Indian  technicians  and  trainees and  the managements  of  the  various  firms  employing  them  varied  widely  from factory  to  factory.  The  personal  qualities  of  the  workers  and  the  attitudes and policies of managements were crucial determinants in these relationships.

For  both  the  government  and  private  employers,  black  labour  was worrisome, now that their colonial war contribution had been made. On the one  hand,  black  workers  had  certain  standards.  Many  of  them  were  very sensitive (by and large they were made to feel so) about work which was 'unpleasant or below their dignity'. They interpreted being given such work as  an  example  of  prejudice  and  discrimination  against  them.  They  also disliked 'outdoor work'. Their main grievance was that they were singled out for special treatment; a more equitable distribution of certain jobs would have  alleviated  the  problem.  Later,  this  discrimination  in  certain  kinds  of jobs,  against  black  workers,  would  become  a  continuing  theme  in  British industry.

On the other hand, those in management were prone to hold grudges. While there were many issues directly related to West Indian workers, there were  also  common  issues  affecting  both  black  and  white  workers.  For example, West Indians who interpreted disciplinary action or dismissals as based on colour prejudice also, in some cases, identified themselves closely with English workers against management if they felt strongly about some other  injustice.  Overall,  the  essential  effect  of  discrimination  practised  by

management against individual West Indians tended to engender strong ingroup solidarity among black workers. 71

Some incidents stirred deep feelings. On one occasion, white workers threatened to strike if the black workers were not suspended or punished in some way for their 'walk out'. Understandably, security of employment has always been a major preoccupation among West Indian workers in Britain. By 1951, in the last remaining government factory in Liverpool, nine out of twelve  West  Indians  were  established  civil  servants  who  enjoyed  the benefits of that status. As one worker put it: 'Establishment gives a man a feeling  of  security  and  you  get  certain  benefits  and  gratuities.  You  know that you will be the last to be sacked. On the other hand, it is a bit of a tie, because  you  cannot  leave  without  sacrificing  those  benefits  you  have accumulated and you have to be prepared to go anywhere or do any job the Ministry likes to send you on.' 72

In  some  factories  black  workers  were  compared  favourably  with  the members of other minority groups employed. One labour manager said, 'I would rather employ a coloured West Indian any day to an Irishman: they are much cleaner and more reliable altogether.' In justifying their prejudices, it seemed, employers resorted to exploiting any differences (real or imagined) between groups of workers.

## Relations between black and white workers and with the trade unions

The relations between the West Indians and white workers were dependent on conditions which varied from place to place, and upon the local situation at  the  time  and  the  personnel  concerned,  both  for West  Indians  and  other workers.  However,  three  main  stages  had  been  identified  in  the  relations between  employers  and  employed.  Firstly,  there  was  the  stage  of  initial surprise and shock to find a group of Blacks doing skilled work; secondly, there was the period when the West Indian group tended to be treated as a scapegoat for the things that went wrong in the factory and thirdly, a stage in which the West Indians gained acceptance as part of the natural order of things  (and  whilst  not  always  completely  integrated  into  the  life  of  the factory)  they  were,  at  any  rate,  tolerated  and  respected  as  individuals  on merit.  A  fourth  change  took  place  when  the  war  ended;  with  increasing redundancies, the West Indian worker tended to be rejected.

During  the  initial  stage  of  surprise  at  black  workmanship,  the  black stereotype as a person of primitive habits, little knowledge and completely uncivilised, was the norm. One West Indian was asked where he kept his tail! At  the  workplace,  there  was  astonishment  when  West  Indians  began work on the machines. One black worker recalled his first day: 'I remember the  first  day  I  started  at  the  factory.  I  was  put  on  a  machine  I  was  quite familiar with because we had used it a lot at home. I began work straight away, but before long I had a crowd of spectators around me all of them wide-eyed!' 73 The novelty did not last long. Soon there was animosity and a series of grievances. Among the West Indians there were excellent workers who received praise from management and in some cases, earned more than white workers. According to one worker this recognition inevitably aroused bad feelings. 74

West Indians had to be particularly careful in their relations with their white co-workers. The atmosphere was, more often than not, charged with tension.  There  was  considerable  ambivalence  in  the  attitudes  of  some whites  towards  the West  Indians. While  there  was  genuine  recognition  of skill, workmanship and other abilities, yet there was reluctance to give full credit. Indeed, the English worker could not accept the black worker as an equal;  he  was  bound,  gagged  and  tied  by  the  notion  of  the  black  man  as being inferior. A case in point was provided by a Jamaican technician who became a shop steward, and later, deputy convenor for the trade union in one factory. In this role he was called upon to represent white employees. When the Jamaican had succeeded in reversing a decision by management which involved a white employee, the employee concerned remarked: 'Well that  damn  nigger  certainly  spoke  up  well  for  me!' 75 Forthrightness  and honesty in West Indians was met with puzzlement and surprise.

Moreover, relations with the trade unions were revealing. Trade unionism, so integral a part of the industrial structure in Britain, was in its infancy  in  the  West  Indies  about  this  time.  Indeed,  the  West  India  Royal Commission of 1939, Major Orde Browne's and the Forster Commission Reports, 76 all emphasised trade union organisation in view of the deplorable labour conditions in the West Indies. Walter Citrine, General Secretary of the TUC (and a member of the Moyne Royal Commission) in spite of the difficulties, was the most insistent advocate of the formation of Trade Union Councils in the West Indies. 77

Given  this  background  then,  the  majority  of  West  Indians  coming  to Britain did not immediately see the significance of trade union membership and  its  value  to  them.  The  trade  unions  themselves  were  not  altogether welcoming. Their attitude was, take it as it is, or leave it. In fact, one union was  especially  slow  to  recognise  that  West  Indians  were  competent  and qualified for full membership. Further, a West Indian was removed from his employment in the shipyard because the shop steward had orders from the union  involved,  the  United  Society  of  Boiler  Makers  and  Iron  and  Steel Shipbuilders (UBISSS). Subsequently, a number of West Indians gained full membership  only  after  providing  credentials  from  their  employers  in Jamaica. Unfortunately, the situation affected some to such an extent that their experience of the union was difficult to eradicate.

The other two unions directly concerned, the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Electrical Trades Union, were much more welcoming. The Ministry  of  Labour  officials  received  the  co-operation  of  the  District Secretaries of these unions. Moreover, the West Indians themselves spoke highly of the way in which the unions tackled any sign of colour prejudice among their members. 'In the union I am a Brother', said one man, 'and there is no distinction of colour, class or creed.'

In  time,  a  number  of  West  Indians  became  actively  involved  in  the Amalgamated  Engineering  Union,  holding  several  offices  for  varying periods  of  time.  Significantly,  this  meant  acting  on  behalf  of  all  factory workers,  both  black  and  white.  Unfortunately,  these  black  trade  union activists were few; the majority of West Indians were apathetic and tended to  get  in  arrears  with  subscriptions. According  to  the  Ministry  of  Labour records  for  1944,  there  were  nine  unions  representing  the  West  Indian technicians. 78

## The end of the Scheme and after

At  the  end  of  the  war,  a  number  of  administrative  problems  arose  as  the Scheme  was  wound  up  and  many  of  the  workers  were  repatriated  to  the West Indies. One of the immediate effects as the Scheme was brought to an end in 1946 was that the West Indian technicians and trainees ceased to be a special group. In effect, they merged into the wider West Indian and black community in Britain, with all its attendant disabilities.

As early as 1944, a scheme of post-war training was envisaged. High expectations were not fulfilled. Indeed, the original proposals were

modified  and  the  final  version  of  the  Scheme  provided  for  'Further Education and Vocational Training'. In this context, further education meant education  beyond  secondary  school  (for  example  at  a  University  or  other establishment of higher education), undertaken on a part or full-time basis. On  the  other  hand,  vocational  training  was  intended  to  give  training essentially in technical work for those who were unable to undertake proper training.  The  precondition  for  receiving  either  an  education  or  vocational training grant was 'effective full-time service in work of national importance during the war'. On these grounds, the West Indian volunteers would qualify. Such training was also related to the benefit accruing to the worker on return to his colonial home. In fact, 'the colonial office wished to be satisfied that there would be employment available in the Colony.' But what  if  they  could  not  be  satisfied? Apart  from  these  crucial  background questions, a further stipulation made was that the West Indians 'must not be in debt to the hostel'. 79 As it was, this proved a troublesome issue.

To get the training plan off the ground, the West Indians received letters explaining the details, and applications were invited. At the outset, it was clear that most of the technicians would not qualify for grants, since they were already trained. Many  accepted repatriation. Others postponed repatriation by applying for training. The final tally showed that only about 12  men  who  were  under  the  Scheme  received  grants  provided  for  by  the Further Education and Vocational Training Scheme.

The percentage refusing repatriation was high for technicians, some 43 per cent. On the other hand, the number of trainees from British Honduras who accepted repatriation was also above average. 80 Those men who had arrived  earlier  were  more  anxious  to  return  home  than  those  who  arrived later.  On  their  return  home  to  the  colonies,  these  early  expatriates  found they had, in effect, jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. They found conditions in the West Indies very poor indeed, and urged their friends to remain  in  Britain.  Judging  from  the  experience  of  the  early  expatriates, repatriation had proved to be a bitter disappointment.

Yet,  by  the  end  of  1946  many  technicians  and  trainees  had  accepted repatriation. Those who refused repatriation were struck-off the Scheme and were  no  longer  qualified  for  an  expatriation  grant.  Further,  they  were  no longer  under  the  special  jurisdiction  of  the  Welfare  Officer.  By  October 1946, 94 men in the Merseyside area were still 'on the scheme', 32 of them

were unemployed. Morale among the men had deteriorated thereafter. 81  In discharging  them,  the  government  had  freed  itself  from  all  responsibility. Thus,  the  least  fit  to  survive  were  left  to  eke  out  an  existence  in  an economic system founded on the survival of the fittest.

## Conditions in the West Indies

Sir Frank Stockdale who said at the beginning of the Scheme that it would make  'a small contribution towards relieving unemployment  in the colonies', seemed  to  have  conveniently  forgotten  the  implications  of repatriation.  Unemployment  in  Liverpool  and  elsewhere  in  Britain  had alerted West Indians to the same problem in the West Indies.

All the official reports upon the social and economic conditions in the West  Indies  supported  the  men's  anxiety  over  employment  prospects  on their  return  there.  In  1943  and  1944,  Sir  Frank  Stockdale  reported  that unemployment problems had become more difficult to resolve year by year, particularly among town dwellers. The position in Jamaica had been quite acute for several years, and in Barbados there was a measure of underemployment at certain times of the year, while St Lucia usually had unemployment problems to face from time to time, especially in Castries and  elsewhere.  In  Belize,  British  Honduras,  there  were  unemployment problems. 82 Further, Sir John MacPherson confirmed the seriousness of the post-war  situation  in  his  report  for  1945  and  1946:  'Towards  the  end  of 1945 unemployment in Jamaica and Barbados threatened to become acute mainly  because  of  large-scale  repatriation  of  British  West  Indian  workers from employment in the United States of America and to a lesser degree the return of demobilised servicemen.' 83

The percentage of unemployment for Jamaica in 1943 was 25.6 per cent and was probably 'higher still' in the post-war years. According to the 1946 Census for the other colonies unemployment ranged from 2.5 per cent in British Guiana to nearly 10 per cent in St Lucia. In addition, all the colonies had a considerable measure of under-employment and seasonal unemployment.

Although it was not until the beginning of 1946 that the full details of the training scheme and the arrangements for repatriation were announced a few  technicians  and  trainees  were  repatriated  during  1945  on  health grounds or for unsatisfactory behaviour. Interestingly, those technicians and

trainees  who  readily  accepted  repatriation  did  not  hesitate  to  warn  their colleagues  still  in  Britain  of  the  poverty  at  home.  They  advised  that  they should prolong their stay in England.

Taken together,  the  facts  regarding  unemployment  in  the West  Indies, and the sentiments expressed in individual letters, showed that a resettlement of the men returning home posed a serious problem. In Britain the  authorities  provided  special  advice  and  assistance  in  adjusting  to civilian life and sought appropriate employment for the demobilised men. To  implement  this,  the  Ministry  of  Labour  set  up  a  Special  Resettlement Advice  Bureau.  Fortunately,  their  work  was  helped  by  full  employment conditions which existed in most parts of the country after the war. In fact, there  was  a  general  demand  for  labour.  This  contrasted  sharply  to  the depressed conditions in the West Indies. For one thing, there were few of the  official  arrangements  that  could  be  compared  with  the  Resettlement Advice Bureau service in Britain. Moreover, high unemployment compounded the difficulties in the way of returning colonial ex-servicemen and volunteer workers.

## The West Indians return to England

The  war  had  offered  opportunities  for  workers  from  the  West  Indies  to escape from unemployment, low wages and poverty to the relative security of  the  war  effort  in  England.  Repatriation  was  the  sad  realisation  of  the return to impoverishment. Adjustment in the colonies was a forlorn hope. Consequently, it was not long before West Indians, particularly Jamaicans, began to find their way back to Britain. By March 1947, the Welfare Officer stated: 'In the consequence of the conditions prevailing in the West Indies, several men previously repatriated by this department have returned to this country; and a few have already been in touch with this office with a view to being placed in employment.'

The arrival of the West Indians in peacetime Britain, not only exposed them to the difficulty of being placed in employment, but also of obtaining reinstatement  in their trade unions. Inevitably, disillusionment in the colonies led to a growing number of West Indians seeking employment in Britain during the post-war years. This number constituted those members of the Scheme who refused the offer of repatriation, and stayed in Britain. Among them were a few demobilised ex-servicemen, repatriated workers, ex-servicemen who decided to return to Britain once more, and finally there

was an influx of men and women who came after the war for the first time, essentially in search of work.

The majority of West Indians coming to Britain at this time, paid for a passage  on  a  ship.  This  flow  of  immigrants  reached  a  high-point  in  July 1948  when  approximately  400  West  Indians  disembarked  from  the SS Empire Windrush . Two hundred and two persons from this group found jobs immediately.  The  majority  of  them  were  skilled  or  semi-skilled  workers. The remaining 198 dispersed throughout the country, and to a few towns, Liverpool and Manchester in particular. In October 1948, 180 West Indians arrived in Liverpool on the SS Orbita including students and wives joining their husbands. Another 39 Jamaicans (including 15 women) arrived at the port in December 1948 on the SS Reine Del Pacifico . And in June 1949 the SS Georgie brought 253 West Indians, including 45 women. Thirty-four of the  men  in  this  party  were  unskilled,  but  the  remainder  were  skilled  or semi-skilled tradesmen in search of work. 84  The flow continued as several hundred West Indians arrived during 1950 and 1951. Given these waves of immigrants,  post-war  immigration  from  the West  Indies  was  estimated  to have reached as high as 1750 per annum. 85

The  inter-war and post-war years saw  an increase in the black population  in  Britain.  Constituting  a  small  but  important  minority,  as  a group, the Blacks were largely disorganised. Often they sought representation for their grievances from black organisations, few of which had  any  real credibility. The  middle  class  black intelligentsia, more concerned with the ideology of Pan Africanism, did not ignore the problems of racial discrimination against black workers. One organisation which did make an attempt at black working class representation during this crucial period was the League of Coloured Peoples.

## 5 The League of Coloured Peoples and Black Radical Groups

During  the  1920s  there  were  several  black  organisations  in  Britain.  The most  notable  were  the  African  Progress  Union  (which  later  had  close connections with the League of Coloured Peoples) led by John Alcindor of Trinidad, the West African Students' Union dominated by Ladipo Solanke, the  Union for  Students  of African  Descent,  and  the  Gold  Coast  Students' Association. 1

After the race riots in Cardiff in 1919, colour prejudice was to rear its ugly  head  time  and  again  in  that  port  as  in  Liverpool.  Discrimination against black seamen (as we have seen) was no secret; indeed it had almost become  a  way  of  life!  By  1925  feelings  against  black  workers  were  so strong that with the support of the National Union of Seamen, Blacks were denied  employment.  Given  the  battering  they  received,  black  workers mainly  in  the  dockland  areas  of  the  major  ports  were,  instead  of  being disorganised and demoralised, drawn together as a community. Beleaguered,  they  lacked  wider  support.  Racial  feeling  had  stirred  many,

and  not  least,  Dr  Harold  Moody,  a  Jamaican  doctor  who  founded  and became the first and only President of the League of Coloured Peoples. 2

Given that there were comparatively few black students in Britain at the time, Moody felt there was a great need for an organisation which would bring together not only students (as the West African Students' Union had done)  but  different  people  as  well  from  as  wide  a  range  as  possible. 3 According to Ras Makonnen (a radical Pan Africanist) the LCP group was an  extension  of  the  English  charitable  tradition,  inter-racial,  involved  in 'mild protest' and harassing the 'goody-goody' elements in Britain. 4

This  was  the  first  major  black  organisation  which  aimed  to  bring  the black races together. The League's original objects were:

To  promote  and  protect  the  Social,  Educational,  Economic  and Political interests of its members;

To interest members in the Welfare of Coloured Peoples in all parts of the world;

To improve relations between the races;

To co-operate and affiliate with organisations sympathetic to coloured people. 5

By the time of its Tenth Annual General Meeting, 'To render such financial assistance  to  coloured  people  in  distress  as  lies  within  its  capacity' 6 was added  to  the  list.  The  officers  were  Ansah  H.  Koi-Vice-President  (West Africa);  Stephen  Thomas  -  Secretary  (West Africa);  Miss  Una  Marson  Assistant  Secretary  (Jamaica);  David  Tucker  -  Publicity  Secretary  and Editor  (Bermuda);  K.  L.  Gordon  -  Treasurer  (Jamaica),  and  Miss  Stella Thomas (West Africa). 7  During the first two years, apart from Ms Marson and Ms Thomas, Christine Moody was also an officer of the League. Other women  involved  were  Mrs  Sylvia  Lowe,  Ms  Dorothy  Clarke,  Mrs Amy Barbour James and Ms Viola Thompson. By 1934-35, J. A. Barbour James (formerly of the African Progress Union) and K. A. Chunchie from Ceylon, were Vice-Presidents. C. L. R. James, Louis Mbanefo, Arthur Lewis, Learie Constantine and Peter Blackman, 8  among others, were also associated with the LCP.

This  nucleus  of  well-educated  black  people  was  confronted  with  the difficulties in bringing together disparate groups of black people in Britain.

In an effort to do this, the League issued a quarterly magazine, The Keys , which  was  sold  at  2/6  per  copy.  The  LCP's  essentially  middle-class leadership assumed that this literature would inform and mobilise the black population in the dockland areas. Through this organ, the League consistently appealed for funds. Financial troubles, more than anything, at least  initially,  hampered  it  from  being  a  more  vigorous  organisation.  The LCP's officers nevertheless gave willingly of their free time since initially there  was  no  prospect  of  employing  paid  officers. Their  commitment  and expertise  guided  their  readers,  pointing  to  cases  of  colour-prejudice  and discrimination wherever they existed. The League focused its attention on Cardiff's  (as  well  as  that  of  Liverpool,  London,  Newcastle,  Hull  and Glasgow) black population, highlighting some of the glaring inequities of the black communities.

What was beyond question was the fact that the colour bar in Britain was  all-pervasive,  reaching  every  level  of  British  society.  Those  who suffered  from  it  individually  had  no  recourse  but  to  seek  solidarity  on common issues. Organisations within the black population in Britain were few. Apart from the Coloured Colonial Seamen's Union, formed in Cardiff in 1935, the LCP was the only organisation able to bring any degree of coordination  to  the  black  worker's  experience  in  Britain  and  elsewhere. Indeed, the CCSU sought the help and advice of the League, the Executive Committee of which unhesitatingly voted the necessary money to enable an investigation  to  be  made  on  the  spot.  In  fact,  it  was  this  initiative  by  the CCSU which alerted Moody personally (and the League) of the deep-seated problems of the black working class in Britain. The League acted quickly. On 13 April 1935, George W. Brown and P. Cecil Lewis, members of the League,  arrived  in  Cardiff  and  the  same  day  began  their  investigation, returning to London with a full report on 19 April.

The report revealed a scandalous situation. The authorities were accused of  wilful  misapplication  of  the  Aliens  Order  of  1920  and  the  Special Restriction (Coloured  Alien Seamen)  Order  of 1925.  Apparently all coloured men were classified as aliens, in spite of indisputable evidence of their  British  nationality. 9 The  League  had  to  face  the  police  and  the shipowners who were supported by the trade unions. Once the facts were established, the League quickly got to work. Spearheading the attack was Moody. He contacted the Unemployment Branch of the Board of Trade and the  Unemployment Assistance  Board,  and  visited  Cardiff  where  he  made

strong representations to the authorities on the matter. In the fight against this injustice, Captain Arthur Evans, MP for Cardiff, forwarded details of 12 cases to the Home Secretary who cancelled their alien registrations.

Moody was thorough in his efforts to redress these gross grievances. He met W. R. Spence, officials of the National Seamen's Union, and Sir Vernon Thomson,  chief  of  the  shipping  subsidy.  Further,  a  memorandum  was presented  to  the  British  Shipping  Federation  and  G.  H.  Hall  MP.  These efforts brought the matter to the attention of the highest authorities and the British  public.  Consequently,  large  numbers  of  black  seamen  had  their British nationality rightly restored to them. 10 The leading light in this matter (as indeed in so many other issues involving the League) was Moody. To understand the true nature of the League of Coloured Peoples, why it came into existence and how it developed, it is necessary to understand the life of Harold Moody.

## Harold Moody: black moderate (founder and leader of the LCP)

Harold  Moody  arrived  at  Paddington  Station  as  a  22-year-old  student  in September  1904. 11   From  the  moment  he  said  goodbye  to  his  family  in Kingston, it seemed he became progressively aware of his colour. He did not, however, allow this to deter him. Although his natural merry humour helped  him,  it  was  not  long  before  he  had  his  first  brush  with  colour prejudice in London.

On arrival at the Young Men's Christian Association in London, he was given  several  addresses  where  he  might  obtain  lodging.  Significantly, everyone turned him away. He spent hours wearily wandering the streets of London  (as  so  many  immigrants  before  him  had  done)  before  he  found himself  in  the  top  garret  of  a  house  in  St  Paul's  Road,  Canonbury. As  a prospective student in the mother country, he naturally expected more from her, but she had given him anything but a warm welcome.

Moody was born in Kingston, Jamaica on 8 October 1882. His mother was  denied  the  privilege  of  scholastic  education  but  she  learned  quickly. During  his  school  days,  Mrs  Moody  insisted  that  young  Harold  should make friends 'with those fairer than himself and harbour no feelings of race distinction'. Mrs Moody was very religious and it was no surprise that her

son became a diligent student of the Bible, and a devout Christian. She tried to get the best education for her son. Fortunately, she succeeded and he was set to become a medical student in London, a rare achievement for a black man at that time. Before he left Jamaica, one of his friends asked what was his greatest ambition. Harold replied. 'To do something for the Race.' 12

In London Moody realised how little he knew of Jamaica. London gave him  the  right  perspective.  He  found  that  he  was  more  familiar  with  the names  and  places  in  Britain  than  those  of  Jamaica.  This  disturbed  him deeply, and was a factor in determining many aspects of his later advocacy and agitation. It was clear to him that he had been brought up in a British and not a West Indian tradition, as such. Indeed, he was almost completely ignorant of the culture and history of his own race. He had been educated away  from  his  native  heritage  and  towards  the  country  which  he  had learned to call home. In other words, the white bias was predominant. This revelation had serious repercussions on his attitude and personality. He was black, but refused 'to admit that he was an African or that he was in any way  related  to  Africa'. 13 For  him  and  his  race,  this  was  tragic.  He  was disturbed by the fact that he was English in education and upbringing, but in temperament he was not. The nagging question was: Where did he really belong?

Moody the activist was a popular speaker at students meetings and was honoured with election to the Presidency of the College Christian Union. When he left King's College, he moved to King's College Hospital, then situated in Lincoln's Inn Fields where he did his clinical training. There, he again confronted colour prejudice among his fellow students. He resolved to stand his ground (rather than bow to the pressure) particularly in view of the many black students who were given tickets of leave from the hospital so that they could pursue their studies elsewhere. His perseverence paid off. His academic  successes  during  training were  glittering; he won  the Warneford Prize and Medal and the Barry Prize in 1906, the Leathes Prize in  1907,  the Tanner  Prize  in  Obstetrics,  and  the Todd  Medal  and  Prize  in Clinical Medicine in 1910. During this year, he was a qualified MRCS and LRCP but could not, for financial reasons, obtain an actual Diploma until the  following  year.  He  completed  his  academic  qualifications  in  1912  by securing the degrees of MB and BS of the University of London. In 1919 he was awarded the 'coveted' degree of MD. Moreover, he was elected as a

member of the Fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine, and in 1925 contributed a paper on 'The Case for Diagnosis' for the Society's journal. 14

As a fully qualified doctor he made a trip back to Jamaica in 1912. On his return to London, he began his practice at Peckham, London. Later he married  a  white  nurse,  Olive  Tranter,  whom  he  had  worked  with  at  the Royal  Eye  Hospital.  This  marriage  of  black  and  white  caused  such  deep anxiety  in  the  families  on  both  sides  that  some  twenty-five  years  later Moody reflected:

I have  always  held  that  marriage  is  an  individual,  private  and personal  matter  concerning  only  the  two  contracting  parties  with which no one has the right to interfere as long as the parties are of age and independent. This does not seem to be the general point of view of the English people and at almost every meeting I am asked the  question  'What  about  intermarriage?'  as  if  a  girl  could  not  do anything worse than to marry a man of colour. Disparity of union be it racial, social, economic or educational, is to be deplored, but I see no reason why two persons, more or less equal in their educational and  social  opportunities,  who  believe  that  they  love  each  other sufficiently  to  overcome  any  differences  of  temperament  and  to contract  marriage,  should  be  prevented  from  entering  upon  such  a contract. 15

After nine years in England, Moody had an established practice, a home of his own and a wife and four children. Indeed, his family responsibilities were many. Christian service, however, had always been 'the breath of life' to him.  He  devoted  much  time  and  energy  to  the  work  of  Clifton Congregational  Church  on Asylum  Road.  It  was  here  that  he  first  made contact with the people of Peckham. Through his practice and ministerial duties he aroused a deep affection among the local people.

In  July  1919,  Moody  set  out  with  his  wife  and  four  children  for  a holiday  in  Jamaica.  Because  of  a  coalminers'  strike  in  Britain,  the  ship called at an American port to fill her bunkers. While this was being done, passengers  were  allowed  to  visit  the  beach  with  their  children.  When Moody attempted to do so, he was told that it was reserved for white people only. This colour bar stirred deep feelings within him. He wrote in his diary,

I pray that God will help me to do something to alter this awful state of things. It is a huge problem with many intricacies but I pray God to give me grace, strength, ability and tact to do something to show the  world  that  character  and  not  colour  is  the  thing  of  ultimate importance. I will not and shall not apologise for my birth . 16

In Jamaica, he took the opportunity of travelling beyond the geographical boundary of his youth in Kingston. The experience brought a clearer vision in his mind of his responsibility to his own kith and kin. He felt he was on the  threshold  of  a  great  undertaking.  He  returned  to  London  with  a  clear commitment to fight in the name of his Christian faith and his beloved race. Earlier, in the 1920s, his fellow Jamaican, Marcus Garvey, though in a quite different way, also taught the black man to see beauty in himself.

## The formation of the League

In putting his campaign into effect, Moody was mindful of the need to use every means at his disposal. His missionary work was important in tackling the  issue  of  race.  No  one  could  discredit  his  work  for  the  Colonial Missionary  Society.  In  1912,  he  was  elected  as  President  of  the  Young People's  Branch  of  the  Society  and  that  same  year  was  also  appointed  a member of the Board of Directors. This afforded him access to the inner councils of British Congregationalism in the Dominions and Colonies of the Empire. He was the first Black person to enter the inner sanctum.

Moody felt this  campaign  should  express  itself  through  the  CMS.  He began to put all his experiences of the problems of Blacks in perspective, drawing together his own experiences at college and hospital, the appeals made to him during the First World War by black men serving in the British armed forces and his growing knowledge of the practice of the colour bar at many levels of human society. On top of it all, he placed his concern for his people in Jamaica.

Soon  he  was  depressed  to  find  that  his  burning  passion  to  eradicate injustice was rebuffed and met with calmness and complacency in those to whom he had appealed. He could not come to grips with the fact that big organisations moved slowly and that often the watchword in the hierarchy was  careful  consideration  and  caution.  This  realisation  forced  him  to concede that the time was not right for the action which he desired. He felt

he could not rely on others; he would carry the message himself. In fact, there was no shortage of opportunity for him to do so. Invitations to preach and  speak  came  increasingly  from  all  parts  of  the  country.  He  was  well received wherever he went to speak. His natural eloquence held the close attention of audiences. And so willy-nilly, his one-man crusade pressed on and grew in popularity.

In 1921 he was highly honoured. As if to compensate for its failure to give full, unqualified commitment to Moody's racial equality crusade, the Society  elected  him  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  Thus,  he became the first black man to occupy that position. He did not see this as tokenism.  Through  this  act,  the  CMS  was  seen  to  free  itself  from  racial prejudice, to show its opposition to the colour bar, and display its Christian belief that there is 'neither bond nor free, black nor white and all men are brothers'. 16 Moody  used his new office to proclaim the Society's commitment. His reputation as a champion of the rights  of  black  people, and a fearless fighter against all race prejudice became firmly established. Word  of  his  campaign  reached  the  distant  colonies  of  the  Empire.  Many were  impressed  and  hopeful  that  he  would  gain  for  them  full  British citizenship which they regarded as their minimum right.

In  the  fight  for  such  rights,  his  home  became  the  hub  of  activity  and fellowship and often the place of call for many who came to Britain to gain further  education,  training  and  wider  experience  in  their  vocations  and professions. Moreover, black workers turned to Moody  in an ever increasing stream for help in the many difficulties they encountered due to their  colour.  Moody  offered  his  counsel  to  all,  particularly  on  jobs  and housing. His telephone rang frequently.

Prejudiced  employers  posed  enormous  problems  and  while  Blacks suffered  gross  indignities,  Moody  remained  receptive,  sympathetic  and helpful. He believed that reason rather than threats and bullying should be the approach in dealing with prejudiced employers.

In fighting his cause, Moody  was  always  Christianlike.  He  was supported  by  'white  Britishers'  who  were  disturbed  by  the  existence  of racial prejudice and were willing to join him in his fight against the colour bar and every manifestation of unjust discrimination. The majority of those who joined him were fellow Christians. He also sought the assistance and prestige of high officers of the church where he was 'accepted as an equal

amongst them and was conscious of no barrier in their company'. 17  Indeed, he had come a long way and made a full adjustment (unlike his unlettered black  brothers)  in  British  society.  He  used  the  respect  he  had  gained  to enlist, during the addresses at large assemblies, sympathetic forces for his campaign.  He  used  his  Chairmanship  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the Colonial Missionary Society to full effect. Meanwhile his personal reputation and prestige continued to grow.

In  1931,  he  was  elected  as  the  President  of  the  London  Christian Endeavour Federation. While  he  realised  he  could  not  put  any  narrow  or sectarian  construction  on  his  leadership,  he  was  able  to  preach  freedom from any attitude of racial distinction and belief in the brotherhood of man in a 'vivid and practical way'. He rose to the challenge of proclaiming his message of racial equality. But he did this tactfully, always in the context of the  Christian  gospel,  for  he  was  an  exponent  of  the  whole  of  'Christian truth'  and  an  advocate  of  the  'Christian  way  of  life'.  He  saw  his  special mission  not  as  a  restriction,  but  as  liberty.  With  this  deep  belief,  he committed himself with great enthusiasm to his work. News of the honour of  leadership,  conferred  on  Moody,  spread  throughout  the  'Negro  World' and  beyond.  With  time  his  influence  grew.  The  number  of  those  who expressed  support  for  his  racial  ideals  multiplied  amongst  Blacks  and Whites.  However,  while  audiences  caught  his  inspiring  message  and enthusiasm at meetings, at the end, they found there was nothing specific that  they  could  relate  to.  They  were  left  only  with  'the  right  attitude  of mind'. He called men and women to fight for the cause of racial justice, but could  not  mobilise  their  ready  response.  The  drawback  here  was  that  the Christian  church  had  more  urgent  business  to  perform  and  could  not concentrate on race. While the Missionary Society was concerned with this question (which had a real bearing on its work) it could not accept it as the reason  for  its  existence.  This  was  precisely  the  attitude  of  all  the  other sympathetic organisations and societies. The result was that Moody found himself heading considerable forces which lacked the direction and fighting power of an organised and disciplined group. Without the full and sincere cooperation of his compatriots, he realised that his objectives could not be achieved. At this stage in his campaign Moody's ambivalence was evident.

Of the racial groups being formed at the time, he wrote, 'They meet in the white man's premises, accept and enjoy his hospitality and at the same time breathe out wrath against him.' He was dissatisfied and distressed after

addressing one of these groups. 'How damaging is the result', he said, 'and how futile for a group of coloured people, a mere handful, to meet in this way. They cannot hope to achieve anything of value this way and they are damaging  their  own  souls.' 18 On  their  own,  these  disparate  bodies  could achieve little. Moody was acutely aware of the need for co-ordination.

He met with  officials  of  several  sections  to  explore  the  possibility  of uniting to form a big organisation which would bring together both black and white peoples. This unity was his great hope. One of the people Moody met  at  this  time  was  Dr  Charles  Wesley,  an Afro-American  Professor  of History at Howard University who was visiting England. After Dr Wesley had spoken to the Central Young Men's Christian Association, Moody put forward to the meeting (an unusually large congregation of his own people) the idea of one united organisation in the interests of the welfare of all black people.  Although  nothing  positive  resulted  (apart  from  Wesley's  keen interest in the scheme) Moody's proposals received a general welcome. He was encouraged. Later, a mass meeting was arranged at which Dr Wesley spoke  on  the  question  of  a  united  organisation  of  black  peoples,  with Moody presiding. A 'full  and  keen'  discussion  followed  and  a  committee was  set up  to examine  the  possibilities of establishing the kind of organisation  advocated  by  Moody.  This  committee  met  at  164  Queens Road, and again on Friday 13 March 1931 at the Central YMCA, Tottenham Court Road, London, where it was decided to form the League of Coloured Peoples.  This  positive  move  was  a  step  forward  of  great  significance. Personally  Moody  had  won  an  important  victory  in  the  campaign  he  had been  conducting  virtually  single-handedly,  with  occasional  confrontations on  specific  issues,  for  a  number  of  years.  With  rank  and  file  support,  he could  hope  for  the  solid  support  and  co-operation  which  he  desperately needed to effect a successful campaign. Through the LCP he was now able to  channel  the  interest,  sympathy  and  zeal  aroused  in  members  of  the congregations and audiences which he addressed.

In effect, the LCP was the focal point, providing the necessary thrust in his campaign. Thus fortified he could make representations to government authorities, hospital managements, medical faculties, commercial concerns, factory  proprietors,  hotel  and  boarding  house  keepers,  among  others,  not only  in  his  own  name,  status  and  reputation,  but  also  in  the  name  of  the black community in Britain and throughout the Empire. Thus, he became the  recognised  leader  of  his  people  in  Britain,  being  elected  the  first

President of the League of Coloured Peoples. With devotion and sacrifice he  served  the  League's  cause,  holding  the  post  of  President  continuously until  his  death  in  1947.  In  many  senses,  'the  League  was  his  life  and  it would not be untrue to say that he was the life of the League'. 19

## The LCP: development and issues

The first two years of the League's existence involved strenuous efforts but meagre results.  Many  of  its  activities  centred  on  the  needs  of  students  in London; for example, in arranging social functions, meetings and conferences on their behalf. Achievement of the League's objects seemed remote then. It was hampered by a lack of publicity without which it was difficult to maintain the interest of its members and attract the attention of others. The League's only means of exposure was through occasional short reports in the press of its main activities and publication of some letters to newspaper  editors.  This was  a  major  obstacle to growth.  A  regular periodical of its own was indispensable. But finance was the problem since its members  were  largely  students  with  limited  resources;  those  few working  class  members  of  its  essentially  middle-class  membership  were even less well-off. Moreover, large donations could not be expected, though many appeals were made. Finally, in spite of the financial risks involved in undertaking  such  a  project,  the  League  had  to  be  positive.  Eventually,  a decision was taken.

And  so  in  July  1933,  the  first  number  of The  Keys appeared  as  the official organ of the League of Coloured Peoples. This quarterly publication received  its  name  from  the  inspiration  of  the  African  Dr  Aggrey  who asserted  that  the  fullest  musical  harmony  could  be  expressed  only  by  the use of black and white keys on the piano. Indeed, the League explained in the  first  issue  that  the  name  was  symbolic  of  what  it  was  striving  for, namely, the opening of the doors now closed to coloured peoples and the harmonious cooperation of the races.

Earlier that year, the League held its first weekend conference at High Leigh,  Hoddesdon.  This  was  attended  by  representatives  from  Bermuda, Great  Britain,  Kamboli,  Ceylon,  Barbados,  the  Gold  Coast,  East  Africa, India, Jamaica, Australia, St Lucia, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and the USA. 20 The issues discussed at the Conference covered a wide range, such as 'The

American  Negro',  'The  West  African',  'The  West  Indian',  'The  Indian Student', 'The East African' and 'Co-operatives in Africa'. Moody glowed with satisfaction over the fellowship displayed and the serious application of alert minds to the problems of his own race by his own people. 21

After  the  Conference,  the  League's  future  seemed  assured.  While  the publication and launching of The Keys and  the  Conference at High Leigh were high spots, most of the League's work, though monotonous, comprised the day-to-day work of assisting individuals in their difficulties and  with  their  problems.  Occasionally,  people  from  the  colonies  found themselves in difficulties in Britain through no fault of their own, and by means of cablegram, letters, interviews (and in other ways) the League was able to help them. Moody's personal influence played a large part.

The League's work could not be restricted because of the wide range of issues brought before it. For the many less fortunate members of the black working class in London, the League cared. The social value of the League was, at least, increasingly being recognised. Many important contacts were made. Indeed, it was at one of these parties of the LCP that Kenyatta first met Gandhi, who was visiting England. 22

Three years after the League's formation, Moody's responsibilities had grown  heavier.  He  attended  numerous  meetings  and  made  numerous representations  on  behalf  of  black  workers.  But  there  was  a  limit  to  his work rate.  In The  Keys of  October  1934  he  informed  readers  that  after  a very stormy three and a half years,

I  have  been  compelled  to  inform  my  Executive  that  owing  to  the great demand  made  upon my  time and my  finances I feel constrained to ask them to accept my  resignation from the Presidency as from March next.

He was nevertheless confident of the League's future adding:

I  now  appeal  to  the  African  and  West  Indian  to  cease  bickering among themselves about things which do not matter, to put aside all petty jealousies and childish petulances and seek to co-operate one with the other for the good of the race. The Englishman may have certain views about us which I have not been slow to state on many platforms up and down the country, but I am more than convinced

that  a  great  many of these views are fostered by ourselves. By far too many of us are lacking in pride of race and are quite-content to be thought English. How can the Englishman respect us if we do not respect ourselves? Also by far too few of us are prepared to put in any solid work for racial development …

There  can  be  no  self-enrichment  without  self-sacrifice.  If  you really are anxious to serve your race, come in and get your training in the League and if you will give unselfishly of your best then I can assure you that you will get such self-improvement as will almost surprise yourself. 23

On the face of it, if the League seemed to have been running smoothly, this  statement  by  Moody  was  a  revelation.  There  were  many  violent disagreements among members of the Executive Committee. Even during the period 1945-53, the LCP's 'inner circle' represented a wide divergence of  political  views.  For  example,  according  to  one  of  the  League's  last secretaries, two of the founder members on the Executive were Dr Belfield Clarke  of  Barbados  (his  name  was  not  listed  in  the  1933-34  Executive printed in The Keys) and Sergeant Roberts of Trinidad who were both rightwingers. George Padmore and Ras Makonnen were Marxists, Sam Morris, General Secretary, a committed anti-colonialist ('always have been, always will  be'),  Desmond  Buckle,  an  active  Communist,  and  Robert Adams,  'a combination  of  the  lot'.  No  wonder  then,  that  Executive  meetings  were 'rough  and  hectic'. 24 This  mixture  was  formidable  opposition  indeed  for Moody, who coped by adopting a reasonably flexible approach if he felt it would help to achieve his objectives.

Commenting on the efforts of white liberals to improve 'race relations', one observer felt that they worked from a middle-class perspective. Thus to them, 'racial equality' implied equality essentially for 'cultured Europeanised'  Blacks  such  as  Paul  Robeson  and  Moody.  Indeed,  many black members of the LCP who mixed in white circles were 'too elitist' to identify with the problems of the black working class. Thus, for the more radical Blacks, such as Padmore and Makonnen, multi-racial organisations such as the LCP only deflected Blacks from a more radical line. 25

Moody, then, was hitting out at some of the radical young students in the Executive who had revolutionary ideas but lacked the experience which

brought as he saw it, wisdom. Cocooned within their schools and colleges, Moody felt they needed to be exposed to the realities of ordinary life. In this conflict  between  Moody  and  his  detractors  on  the  Executive,  the  radical faction  were  convinced  that  a  more  militant  approach  could  become operational were it not for the intransigence of vested interests, power and authority.  Moody  had  no  confidence  in  revolutionary  methods  which  he regarded as more destructive than creative. But, was not destruction also a creative force?

It was clear that Moody loved Britain and the British, although he often expressed anger over British policy. He firmly believed that only by mutual understanding and trust could they see their responsibilities to the 'coloured peoples'.  Given  these  opposed  views  of  the  contending  parties  in  the Executive, they were bound to quarrel.

There  was  also  disagreement  over  the  phrase  in  the  League's  title: 'Coloured  Peoples'.  What  exactly  did  it  mean?  To  Moody  it  meant members  of  the  'Negro  race',  particularly  those  in  Africa  and  the  West Indies who were under British rule, though there were cordial relations with the  National  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Coloured  Peoples  in America. Some members of the Executive, on the other hand, held that the title  should  include  Chinese  and  other  Orientals.  Moreover,  they  claimed that the League should accept Indians in Africa and British Guiana where 43  per  cent  of  the  population  were  Indians.  In  spite  of  these  arguments, Moody won the day, carrying the Committee with him. But the disenchanted  faction  remained  unconvinced.  In  effect,  as  Moody  saw  it, they hampered the unity, purpose and action on which the League's future depended.

Divisions and differences of opinion, though necessary, were blamed on external factors. For Moody the divisive issue was the fact that many of his young Committee members had been conditioned by the environment and the philosophy of pragmatism and materialism. They were attracted to the experiments of Russian Communism and its Marxian economic doctrines. This  was  anathema  to  Moody  who  believed  that  the  'foundation  of  all things was the Christian religion and the true realities were spiritual and not material'. 26 It was abundantly clear then, given Moody's leadership, that the aims of the League could and would be attained only through the Christian way.

Nevertheless,  the  sharp  criticisms  of  Moody's  opponents  hurt  him deeply. While he cared about 'the absence of unity' he was not willing to compromise. Although this dichotomy discouraged and depressed him, 'he maintained his outward geniality and carried his sorrows in the secret of his own heart'.

Admirable as his bearing was, he made no peace with his critics. At the expense of disunity, he was content to wallow in self-righteousness, though aware of the damage he could do. The months between October 1934 and January 1935 were painful for Moody. Eventually, he made his decision 'to part company with the child of his dreams'. While the split in the Executive remained, the final separation did not actually take place. In April 1935 The Keys proclaimed that it was happy to announce that 'Dr Harold Moody has reconsidered  his  decision  to  relinquish  the  Presidency  this  year  and  was unanimously  re-elected  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting.'  The  journal reminded readers that Moody had been President of the League throughout most of its critical years and had gained an insight into its problems which would prove invaluable in the task ahead: 'A man of courage and ability', it added,  'he  will  be  able  to  impart  the  touch  of  leadership  which  is  the strength of every organisation.' 27

Given this confidence in him, Moody responded:

The overwhelming expression of opinion opposing my decision to resign and other happenings have compelled me to alter my decision and  to  accept  the  unqualified  mandate  of  the  League  of  Coloured Peoples and to continue in office a while longer … The objective of the League is, as it has been since its inception, to unite the various elements of our race and kind for the teaching of Jesus Christ and I willingly lend a part of my life and work to the League in this fight to serve in accordance with his standards of goodwill and morality. Present happenings in neurotic Europe point to the re-disturbance of peace on earth by another war. What is to be the attitude of negroes throughout the world to this new conflict? 28

These last words were indeed vital as Blacks faced an uncertain future.

The  League's  work  continued  under  Moody's  'wise  and  vigorous' leadership.  Christian  people  were  generous  subscribers  to  the  League's funds.  Members  of  the  League  were  welcome  at  all  kinds  of  church

functions and many black (middle class?) people were received in Christian homes 'as guests without suspicion or prejudice'.

The wider interests of Africans, however, were always in the mind of Moody and the League. Moody led a deputation to see J. H. Thomas, the Colonial Secretary in London, following the Governor's suspension of the Tshekedi from his position as Paramount Chief of the Bamangwato Tribe in Bechuanaland.  Moody  also  sent  a  strongly  worded  letter  to  Thomas concerning  the  proposal  to  incorporate  Bechuanaland,  Basutoland  and Swaziland in the Union of South Africa, and pointed out the unsatisfactory nature of the policy of the Union government in matters of native affairs. In Britain,  at  Moody's  instigation,  questions  were  asked  in  the  House  of Commons and all decisions and actions were monitored.

Sixteen  years  after  the  Cardiff  race  riots  in  1919,  there  were  an estimated 3000 black seamen, most of whom were in distress. 29  In 1935, British merchant shipping in this Welsh port, among others, was depressed.

Among  the  working  class  issues  on  which  the  League  intervened following  the  Cardiff  racial  'riots'  and  the  subsequent  depression  in  the shipping industry were the call for repatriation of the black community and the unemployment and distress of black seamen as it related to pressure and deliberate trickery by the police, employers and trade unions to get all black seamen to submit to compulsory registration as 'Seamen' aliens. Furthermore, the LCP published a report of its findings after investigation of  the  inadequate  Unemployment Assistance  and  depressed  conditions  of the black community, particularly in areas of serious and urgent need such as the social, cultural and educational underdevelopment.

So devastating was the destitution and oppression of the Blacks that the representations of the League were questioned. Clearly, The Keys was then, and remained throughout its existence, the organ of a well-intentioned but distant black elite. The black seamen, aware of this, and having themselves formed  the  Coloured  Colonial  Seamen's  Union,  would  have  preferred  to participate fully in the representations made by Moody on their behalf. It is therefore  not  surprising  that  black  workers  in  Cardiff  resisted  being  led from  above  by  'superior'  outsiders. 30 More  particularly,  they  may  have resented The Keys '  appeal  to  readers  to  help  by  employing  black  girls  as domestics .

Opposition from black workers to this form of employment is understandable when one considers that the very people who were baying for  repatriation  of  the  Blacks  from  Cardiff  (some  of  them  liberal  social investigators)  were  the  very  people  who  regarded  this  occupation  as  the upper  limit  of  black  womanhood,  decency  and  capability.  Why  not  more education, social facilities and better opportunities?

Interestingly, and  regrettably,  although  the  League  recruited  many members, it tried unsuccessfully to establish a permanent branch in Cardiff. This  was  partly  due  to  the  fact  that  seamen  were  continuously  toing  and froing, and also because there was deep suspicion among black workers of the  LCP's  middle-class  leadership.  The  local  black  leaders  'were  not prepared … to have a middle class London organisation control the Cardiff race relations situation'.

For  the  black  population  comprising  Africans,  West  Indians,  Malays, Somalis,  Indians  and  others,  discrimination  meant  they  were  precluded from employment on subsidised ships. 31  In effect, by the stroke of a pen, hundreds of these men were denied their only means of livelihood. Their common  grievances  led  to  organisation  in  the  form  of  the  Coloured Colonial Seamen's Union.

Naturally, this union turned to the LCP for help on such matters as the Alien  Order  (1920)  and  the  Special  Restriction  (Colonial  Alien  Seamen) Order (1925). The League, at least, was determined to establish the facts. Moody thoroughly involved himself on behalf of the black seamen in an effort  to  rectify  the  gross  injustices  of  these  Orders.  Moreover,  when  the officers of SS Eskdalegate refused to sign on five Jamaicans, though they had  been  regularly  employed  on  that  ship,  Moody  immediately  contacted Messrs Turnbull, Scott and Company, the London owners of the ship, and Sir Vernon Thomson of the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee. While the shipowners simply confirmed the facts, Thomson assured Moody that if the men  were  Jamaicans  they  would  be  allowed  to  sail.  The  men  were  reengaged and sailed. This was one of many cases on which Moody had been successful on behalf of members of his race in the manual trades and 'could no  longer  be  accused  of  interest  only  in  the  student  and  professional classes'. 32 It is surprising that he took so long to come to their aid. In fact, the  conditions  of  black  seamen  in  Cardiff  and  Liverpool  docks  were eyesores  which  could  not  have  failed  notice.  Nevertheless,  the  League's

investigation brought to light startling facts about the social and economic condition of the black community in Cardiff and elsewhere in Britain. Put simply,  these  people  were  left  to  languish.  Practically  no  provision  was made for the social and cultural life of black people and many of them were on or below 'a very low poverty line'. 33

Moody's  spiritual  beliefs  were  now  assuming  a  more  material  form. Mindful  of  his  own  children,  he  was  disturbed  and  anxious  about  the welfare of the children of mixed marriages. On the prospects for jobs for 'coloured' children between 14 and 18 years of age, he felt it was a wellknown fact that no black boy or girl could procure a job in any office no matter how qualified. No engineering works was willing to employ them, and apart from shipping, they had no outlet. He asked, 'Is there no Christian man big enough to tackle this task and blaze a trail for the kingdom of God? Surely  there  is?'  Unfortunately,  Moody's  attention  was  on  the  individual rather than the system which produced and showed  every sign of prolonging this tragedy.

In  the  interests  of  these  adolescents,  he  wrote  to  the  authorities  in Swansea,  Hull,  South  Shields,  Glasgow,  Liverpool,  London  and  Cardiff, and held discussions with the officers of the Juvenile Employment Bureaux. Moreover, the  British  Social  Hygiene  Council  made  an  investigation  into the wider aspects of the problem. A tireless worker, with missionary zeal, Moody visited Cardiff several times to assess the situation. Increasingly, the black populations of the British seaports became the centre of his concern. (We shall return later to Moody's relations with local black groups during the 'Cardiff Crisis'.)

But, in spite of the gravity of these problems, Moody was not parochial in his concerns. His Pan Africanist approach took precedence. At the time, African affairs were of central international interest because of the Italian attack on Abyssinia. A mass meeting of the LCP, held on 4 September 1935, unanimously adopted a resolution which reflected not merely an expression of opinion on the invasion, but a statement of policy on the future of Africa. In  it  the  League  expressed  its  utmost  co-operation  with  the  Emperor  of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian people 'in the deep shadow of war', which hung over their beloved country and felt that this attitude of a European country towards an African people was a reflection of a deep-seated conviction in the minds of most European peoples that African peoples were ordained to be serfs. The League hoped that this idea would be dispelled once and for

all,  and  that  Europe  would  begin  to  recognise  Africa  and  the  African peoples as equal partners with her in the great task of human development, and  that  the  European  would  no  longer  exploit  the  African  but  would concede his demands of directing his own affairs. Moreover, he urged the European countries which wielded authority in Africa that 'the time is now ripe  for  them  to  consider  a  plan  for  the  future  of Africa  which  should  be nothing  less  than  the  ultimate  and  complete  freedom  of Africa  from  any domination whatsoever'. 34

While the League was struggling against the colour bar and race, world events  reflected  these  issues.  Hitler  was  implementing  a  policy  of  racial superiority against the Jews in Germany. And in the United States, the case of the Scottsboro boys was another aspect of racial discrimination. With the start of the blitz, many members of the International African Service Bureau refused to be recruited in the war effort. According to Ras Makonnen, the radical Pan Africanist, 'There is only one war we will fight. It is the war against Britain. So don't tell us about Hitler. We are not interested. We are only concerned about the man who is on our shoulders now.' 35

Authoritative measures taken by the colonial governments in St Vincent and the Gold Coast introduced powers of censorship. Whatever the merits of  these  imperial  directives  elsewhere  in  the  Empire,  matters  had  already gone  beyond  recall.  A  series  of  disturbances  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago,  St Kitts, British Guiana and St Lucia resulted in many civilians being killed, wounded and arrested by the repressive imperial and colonial forces.

To say the least, labour conditions in these colonies were deplorable. 36 The  low  price  of  sugar  led  to  the  collapse  of  the  sugar  monoculture;  an industry  on  which  so  much  was  dependent.  Several  hundred  thousand labourers and their families faced starvation. After a long gestation period in ferment, they rebelled. Then there was the special case of South Africa where  the  Union  had  introduced  a  new  native  franchise  policy  which  in effect denied Africans the right of a direct vote. They were to be represented by four white men in the Senate, 'an effective chamber'. Moreover, a new body, a 'Native Advisory Council' was to be established with, predictably, no executive or legislative powers.

There were also serious risings among workers in the copper mines of Northern  Rhodesia  against  a  poll-tax  equal  to  a  month's  wages.  In  the

confrontation, government forces were reinforced by support from Southern Rhodesia. Tear gas was used to control the workers. 37

Given  black  rebellion  in  the  colonies,  Moody  used  his  undoubted influence in Britain by sending letters and cables and making speeches and giving  interviews  on  these  international  matters. As  a  colonial  himself  he was particularly concerned.

When  the representatives of the Dominions, colonies and other territories  came  to  Britain  in  1937  for  the  Coronation  of  King  George VI and  Queen  Elizabeth,  Moody,  the  opportunist,  played  an  active  part  in cementing the bonds of fellowship between the peoples (white and black) of the British Commonwealth.

Among the English upper classes, Moody was well-received. But this did not actively help him to reach the objectives he sought. In the midst of many  pleasantries,  he  was  patient.  But  all  this  was  marred  by  events  in Jamaica  and  other  parts  of  the  West  Indies,  where  the  deplorable  living conditions of the working  class provoked  unprecedented  riots. High unemployment and low or nonexistent poor relief were indefensible.

Furthermore,  the  education  system  was  in  need  of  reforms,  and  bad housing was prevalent. Following major strikes in Trinidad and Barbados, Moody contacted a 'sympathetic' Secretary of State, Malcolm MacDonald and  led  a  deputation  of  representatives  of  the  League,  the  Union  of Democratic  Control,  the  National  Council  of  Civil  Liberties,  and  the Colonial Information Bureau. He seemed to be the spokesman for the black population in Britain. The position of black people in Britain was reflected by  that of their fellow  Blacks  in  the  colonies.  Moody  seized  every opportunity  to  develop  this  relationship.  In  doing  so  he  had  willing accomplices. The Times published three of his letters and at a meeting held (in June) at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, a resolution was sent to the  press  and  colonial  office,  which  expressed  horror  at  the  bloodshed  in Jamaica, where since 3 May 1938, no fewer than 11 persons had been killed and a large number wounded in the disturbances which arose from the effort of the Jamaican workers to improve their intolerable conditions. It called on the  British  government,  on  the  basis  of  an  economic  survey  and  a  full enquiry  into  the  political  and  economic  structure  of  the  islands,  to  take immediate active steps to improve the economic condition of the population;  in  particular,  to  ensure  and  protect  a  market  for  West  Indian products  at  reasonable  prices  and  by  redistributing  the  land  so  as  to

establish a large and prosperous peasantry. Moreover, the resolution called upon  the  British  government  to  give  universal  free  education  up  to university  standard  and  to  establish  a  University  of  the  West  Indies;  to ensure that these measures were not thwarted by local vested interests; to grant the people of Jamaica and of all the British West Indian islands the same constitutional rights and the same civil liberties as those enjoyed by the people of Britain, including universal adult suffrage and the removal of the  property  qualification  for  members  of  the  Legislature;  to  form  a Federation of the West Indies with complete self-government, with the hope that on the Commission to be appointed by His Majesty's Government there would be at least two representatives of West Indian labour. 38

When the Royal Commission was appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Moyne,  it contained two representatives of the British labour movement, Walter Citrine and Morgan Jones MP, but no representative for West Indian labour. The Commission's terms of reference were to investigate social and economic conditions in the British West Indies 'and matters connected therewith and to make recommendations'. It was found, however, that political questions were not included nor was the constitutional  issue.  Moody  pointed  this  out  to  Malcolm  Macdonald  who said  that  the  words  'and  matters  connected  therewith',  were  deliberately included  so  that  consideration  of  the  constitutional  or  any  other  aspect should not be excluded.

The League took every opportunity provided by the appointment of this important  Commission  to  further  its  cause.  It  drew  up  and  gave  wide publicity  to  a  document  which  set  out  a  minimum  programme  of  change and development in the West Indies. This attributed the discontent there to the widespread poverty of the people, the failure of the government to take appropriate  steps  to  improve  conditions  and  the  absence  of  machinery through  which  the  people  could  press  their  claim  and  express  their grievances  -  in  other  words,  the  lack  of  constitutional  liberty.  Further,  it stated,  'For  one  people  to  dominate  another  is  unchristian  and  cannot  but have evil results. The time has now come to put an end to this domination, to  remove  the  distinction  between  a  commonwealth  of  free,  prosperous, self-governing peoples and an empire of poverty-stricken vassals.' 39

The League was using strong language and becoming more insistent in its  demands.  In  support  of  these  demands  Moody  received  the  sympathy

and  backing  of  the  Congregational  Union  of  England  and  Wales,  the National Free Church Council and the Fellowship of Reconciliation, among other  bodies.  Moody  himself  travelled  to  all  parts  of  Britain  to  address meetings.

While  Moody  and  the  League  awaited  'radical'  recommendations arising from the Commission's investigation into all aspects of West Indian life, events  in  Europe  took  a  gloomy  turn.  As  Hitler  and  Mussolini dominated  the  political  scene,  Moody  and  the  LCP  monitored  the  antisemitic policy in Germany. Racial persecution disturbed Moody for he well understood that persecution of the Jew and persecution of the African were inseparable matters. Both were wrong for the same reason, namely that they violated and denied the basic natural rights of the human personality.

World-wide  colour  conflict  and  racial  prejudice  kept  Moody  and  the LCP  busy.  In  the  process  of  making  representations,  they  received  wide publicity. Due to the cancellation of the League's Annual Christmas Sale in 1939, its finances were depleted. The League was forced to cut back on its expenditure. Consequently, its work was put on a voluntary basis and the offices were now the home of Moody. In the circumstances, The Keys was suspended and News  Notes , a monthly duplicated 'Newsletter' first appeared in October 1939. In that issue Moody wrote:

In common with other organisations, the League has been badly hit as  a  result  of  the  sudden  and  unfortunate  onset  of  War.  It  is  our fervent hope that it will be of short duration, and that from it will emerge freedom for all people, not only in Europe but also in Africa and Asia. True peace cannot reign over the world until the liberty and freedom of the individual is fully recognised and respected and men  and  nations  acknowledge  God  as  their  supreme  and  only Dictator. In the meanwhile the LCP propose to carry on. 40

Given Marx's view that religion was the opium of the masses, Moody was interestingly prepared to trade in one kind of bondage for another! It is therefore not surprising that the Executive Committee was split between the Moody faction and the radicals who wanted a more materialistic approach in tackling the problems confronting Blacks.

The League's work continued nevertheless, and it was soon evident that the need for such work had not diminished, but increased as the 'colour bar'

was  being  practised  at  the  highest  levels.  The  League  chided  the  British government  for  stipulating  in  its  advertisements  for  all  responsible  and executive  posts  in  the  colonies  that  applicants  must  be  of  European parentage. As  the  Second  World  War  loomed  large,  this  question  was  of central importance in granting commissions in the British Armed Forces. It was felt that a full memorandum on the subject of the 'colour bar' in the forces  and  in  the  civil  administration  should  be  prepared  and  copies circulated to all MPs.

In  spite  of  such  devotion,  changes  in  the  colonies  came  slowly  and grudgingly.  When  the  Colonial  Office  stated  on  19  October  1939  that 'British  subjects  from  the  colonies  and  British  protected  persons  in  this country, including those who are not of European descent, are now eligible for  emergency  commissions  in  His  Majesty's  Forces'  Moody,  although thankful, was not satisfied. He said, 'We do not want it only for the duration of the war we want it for all time. If the principle is accepted now surely it must be accepted for all time.' 41 But clearly, this was only the first step on a long journey.

The new policy was tested and Moody's son, Arundel, was one of the first  to  be  accepted  as  an  Officer-Cadet  in  the  British  Army.  Later,  he became a major in the Royal West Kent Regiment, and Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. He concluded his war service as a major in the Caribbean Regiment, commanding it on the return to Jamaica for demobilisation.

During  the  war  (a  time  of  great  hardship)  Moody  felt  the  League's grievances should be muted. Nonetheless, branches of the League were set up in Jamaica, Sierra Leone and British Guiana. Moody was now seeking the help of everyone. He sought to balance independence with co-operation. Thus white people were admitted as members of the League, but could not serve  in  any  of  its  offices  on  the  Executive  Committee.  At  the  Annual Meeting that year he pointed out that the League's publications were quoted extensively in the overseas press, and that no other 'coloured' organisation in Britain had such wide acceptance. He claimed that the British goverment recognised  it  as  the  main  body  representing  the  needs  of  the  coloured peoples.

Moody  was  right  about  the  League's  prestige.  At  the  request  of  the Secretary of State for the colonies it was given the important responsibility of preparing a memorandum setting out its views of the Recommendations of  the  West  India  Royal  Commission.  While  the  League  commented  on

'certain  aspects  of  social  welfare'  and  was  in  'substantial  agreement'  on education,  public  health,  housing,  industrial  legislation  and  transport,  its emphasis was mainly on economic and political questions. 42

When publication of the Report was withheld on the grounds that the conditions in the West Indies revealed in the Report were such as to have been useful to Germany and her propagandists in her anti-British publicity, the  League  protested  against  this  secrecy,  alleging  that  it  hindered  West Indian progress. Although at the time it was difficult to judge the influence of the League's comments and suggestions on the final recommendations, subsequent events have proved their wisdom.

The use and abuse of black people in Britain and abroad was the focal point of the League's concern. During the war, Moody questioned the use of the  word  'nigger'.  He  wrote  to  the  BBC  in  1940,  after  one  of  their announcers when interpreting some records made use of the offensive term 'nigger'.  'There  is  no  need  for  me  to  remind  you  that  this  is  one  of  the unfortunate  relics  of  the  days  of  slavery,  vexatious  to  the  present  day Africans and West Indians and an evidence of incivility on the part of its user. I hope you will take some steps to repair the damage done.' 43

The  fault  was  acknowledged.  Moody  received  an  apology  and  was assured that everything was being done to prevent a repetition. This incident was particularly relevant since an increasing number of West Indians and Africans were arriving in Britain to render their services in all spheres of the war effort. Yet, a colour bar existed, rearing its ugly head in an incident involving  Learie  Constantine,  the  well-known  West  Indian  cricketer  who was also a welfare officer in the Ministry of Labour. Constantine, his wife and daughter and three friends had booked accommodation at a hotel for four nights. When they arrived they were told bluntly that because of their colour  and  the  fact  that Americans  were  staying  there,  they  could  remain only one night. Needless to say, this infuriated Moody who described the incident  as  a  'gross  insult'. Moody's  calmness  and  moderation  were beginning to run out. He wrote, 'Surely the time has now arrived when we should  ask  our  Government  to  bring  in  suitable  legislation  in  order  to prevent  such  unfortunate  occurrences.  We  have  been  against  legislative action  in  the  past  and  have  relied  on  education,  but  this  process  seems tragically slow in its progress towards the goal if indeed it will ever arrive there.' 44

For  this  comment,  Moody  was  compensated  with  British  press  front page  publicity,  even  in  the  midst  of  the  war.  Indeed,  the  war  was  being fought on two fronts. With black and white troops fighting on the same side against Nazi Germany,  influential British officials were sensitive to Moody's comments, particularly on the colour bar and racial prejudice, both in Britain and abroad. His prominence  among  British  Liberals was undisputed.  One  of  the  many  honours  he  received  was  his  election  as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the London Missionary Society in 1943,  after  being  elected  a  year  earlier  as  Deputy  Chairman.  He  was  the first  black  man  to  hold  this  position.  As  head  of  the  British  Missionary Society  he  was  concerned  with  matters  relating  to  Africa,  India,  China, Madagascar, New Guinea and the islands of the South Pacific Ocean, apart from  the  West  Indies.  In  these  lands,  Moody's  Presidency  brought  great hope. The world's press noted the great satisfaction it gave to Africans and their descendants everywhere.

Following his induction, Moody suggested that the religious bodies of Britain and America should immediately meet to consider in detail a speedy plan  for  the  complete  emancipation  of  Africa,  which  should  include  the educational,  social,  economic  and  political  liberation  of  the  continent  and the rapid emergence of Africa as an equal partner in the family of nations. He appreciated that  such  a  plan  would  demand  nothing  less  than  full  cooperation  from  all  the  governments  concerned.  He  urged  that  immediate steps  should  be  taken  to  form  a  competent  and  responsible  council  of Africans which should act in concert with a similar body of Europeans and Americans  to  define  the  future  of  the  African  peoples.  In  this  grandiose plan,  Moody  aimed  to  achieve  the  unity  of  all  Africans  and  the  fullest development of their country's resources, materially, intellectually, morally and  spiritually.  Since  the  end  of  the  war  in  1945,  events  and  needs  of Britain and Europe had made Africa, in many new ways, the centre of their interest.

Political power had become increasingly a central part of his vision. He was invited  to  serve  as  a  member  of  the  Colonial  Office  Committee,  'To examine the question of training at home and overseas, for nurses who are to serve in Colonial territories and to make recommendations for increased public health activities and for the fostering and development of community welfare'. 45

He  sat  on  many  other  bodies,  making  his  presence  felt.  In  February 1947, he became (at the request of the Colonial Secretary) a member of the Colonial Social Welfare Advisory Committee to consider problems affecting urban and rural communities in the colonies, the training of social welfare  workers  and  related  questions.  (Sadly  he  did  not  live  to  attend  a meeting.) He was also Vice-Chairman of the Child Protection Committee of the Save the Children Fund, bringing to bear his abilities and influence on the cause of unfortunate children in Africa, the West Indies and Britain. He was now in a position to influence policies on colonial matters. But was this to  deflect  his  attention  away  from  a  deeper  commitment  to  the  black community in Britain?

Moody's grasp of world events was quick. Indeed, it had to be for this was a major part of his strategy as leader of the League. Important decisions were being made at a high level. Following the promulgation of the Atlantic Charter, by statesmen at the United Nations, which was intended to outline the form and character of the post-war world, Moody arranged a conference in  London  in  July  1944  to  draft  a  'Charter  for  Coloured  Peoples'.  The Charter called upon the governments of the UN to adopt the following:

- 1. The same economic, educational, legal and political rights should be enjoyed by all persons, male and female, whatever their colour. All discrimination in employment, in places of public entertainment and refreshment, or in other public places shall be illegal and shall be punished.
- 2. Governments  administering  dependent  territories  shall  proclaim  this  acceptance  of  and  give effect to the following:
- (a) that comprehensive plans be made  and put into effect in accordance  with  a  definite  time  schedule  for  the  economic, educational,  social  and  political  development  of  the  dependent regions and their peoples and adequate funds provided;
- (b) that all such development shall be in the interests of the regions concerned;
- (c) that  the  educational  plans  shall  in  the  shortest  possible  time enable the peoples of such territories to play their full part in all spheres and at all levels of activities in their own countries;
- (d) that  the  indigenous  peoples  of  all  independent  territories  shall have immediately a majority on all law-making bodies, and shall be granted full self-government at the earliest possible opportunity;
- (e) that imperial  powers  shall  be  required  to  account  for  their administration  of  dependent  territories  to  an  international  body

with powers of investigation, and to make regular reports on the steps taken towards self-government. 46

This  'revolutionary'  document  was  sent  to  every  government  of  the United  Nations  and  to  almost  every  responsible  leader and  national organisation in church and state in many countries. It was widely publicised in  the  British  press  and  especially  in Africa  and  the West  Indies  where  it was enthusiastically received.

While  the  Charter  achieved  no  immediate  results,  it  kept  attention focused  on  the  needs  and  rights  of  the  coloured  peoples.  In  subsequent years, however, many steps were taken in the direction which the Charter pointed.  A  committee  of  the  League  was  appointed  to  investigate  the influence of school textbooks and teaching on the formation of the attitude of British people to race questions. On his last visit to Jamaica Moody had left a manuscript with the intention that it should be printed and circulated so that the work he had begun would continue. Unfortunately, this pamphlet never  appeared.  On  his  return  voyage,  Moody  wrote  a  full  report  of  his experiences and his observations of the problems in the West Indies for the Colonial  Secretary  and  the  Conference  of  British  Missionary  Societies. Sadly, he could not present or expand on them. In fact, Moody was ill when he arrived in Liverpool. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died on 24 April 1947. 47

Although he had little time for extensive writing, he wrote many letters to The Times and other leading British newspapers, occasional articles for various periodicals and many of his sermons were published. He edited, for extended periods, the League's journal, contributing a lengthy Presidential letter  regularly.  He  was  also  the  author  of  four  booklets, Youth and Race, Christianity  and  Race  Relations,  Freedom  for  All  Men ,  and The  Colour Bar . 48

Moody was a man of thought and deed. He directed the League on the stand  taken  on  various  issues.  As  the  leader  of  the  LCP,  he  was  not accountable to a rank and file, since the League could not be said to have had  such  an  organisation.  In  effect,  he  was  the  League's  motivator  and activist. Through sheer force of personality (his undoubted gifts of oratory and  intellect)  and  religious  conviction,  he  became  'acceptable'  and  from this  pulpit,  he  announced  his  plans  for  'coloured  peoples'  and  the  issues

affecting  them,  on  a  grand  scale,  starting  at  Cardiff.  To  this  extent  he succeeded.  Organisationally,  however,  his  greatest  test  as  a  leader  of  the black  community  was  with  black  leaders  and  groups  in  Cardiff  and elsewhere.

## The Cardiff crisis: local organisations and the LCP

In 1935, following the black seaman's forced registration, during a period of 'extreme depression' in the shipping industry, the union was at it again forcing a bill through Parliament which provided quotas on the number of black seamen who could sail on British ships. In effect, virtually all black seamen  became  unemployed.  So  serious  were  the  effects  of  the  Cardiff Crisis  of  1935  that  it  became  'one  of  the  most  important  events  in  the history of race relations in the British Isles'. 49

In this depression the black community had to rely on its resourcefulness.  The  'Crisis'  itself  attracted  strong  views  from  various interested bodies.  While  the  'Liberal-humanitarians'  and  white  labour leaders called for a check on black immigration and voluntary repatriation of black seamen, the Communists insisted on the right of black seamen to stay in Britain and took the opportunity to argue that race prejudice would not  disappear  from  Britain  until  the  colonies  were  freed.  One  of  the staunchest proponents of this Communist challenge was the Indian activist and  Communist  for  Battersea,  Saklatvala. 50 In the  circumstances,  the question of colour could not be avoided. For the Communists. imperialism was  the  cause  of  the  'colour  bar'.  In  post-war  Britain,  the  CommunistSocialist utopia, in its most extreme form, was represented by members of the Comintern, an organisation devoted to bringing about world revolution. Through  its front organisation, the Seamen's  Minority  Movement,  it championed the cause of the black seamen. Another front organisation in Cardiff at the time was the Colonial Defence Association, formed in 1927. Moreover,  the  League  Against  Imperialism  also  occasionally  fought  the black seamen's cause. 51

Given their strong arguments, the Communists aroused much sympathy and a small following. The spectre of black labour in the port of Cardiff had its 'red' implications. For although difficult to prove, as one observer put it,

'it  is  likely  that  concern  over  the  growth  of  the  Communist  movement among coloured people was one factor in stimulating humanitarian circles to begin action on the colour question in the early 1930s'. 52

While  the  above-mentioned  humanitarian  and  communist  associations interested in race relations were white-controlled, between 1931 and 1937, the LCP became an accepted part of the structure of British race relations. The League advocated a Pan African brand of humanitarianism in carrying out its functions as a social club, housing bureau, pressure group, investigative  agency  and  employment  agency.  Moreover,  it  served  as  a 'middle-class validator' and attempted (without success) to play the role of co-ordinator of all race relations agencies.

Harold Moody, ever vigilant to exploit a situation to the advantage of the  LCP,  became  an  adept  manipulator. As  we  saw,  he  not  only  stressed international co-operation but also called for the unity of the black race. He used Pan African sentiments to engender solidarity in order to achieve LCP objectives.  He  felt  that  black  people  'will  never  be  free  until  they  unite among themselves'. 53 Moody, the 'Race Man', constantly pleaded for the unity of people of African descent everywhere. He saw race pride and race loyalty  as  crucial  to  achieving  racial  solidarity.  Although  Whites  were allowed to become League members, Moody considered the League to be an  essentially  black  organisation  with  'white  allies'.  He  asked,  if  black people who sought the uplift of the race could not reach agreement among themselves, and with 'those English folks who are working on our behalf, how then can we ever hope to obtain our objectives?' 54  And in accordance with  his  objectives,  he  was  able  to  maintain  an  Executive  Board  which always constituted representatives from the United States, the West Indies and occasionally, an Asian. 55

With  the  publication  of The  Keys in  January  1933,  the  Pan  African orientation of the LCP reflected Negro news and personalities; injustices as well as achievements were reported. 56 Through The Keys ,  the  LCP  spoke for  the  race  everywhere.  Moody's  attempt  to  get  unity  was  frustrated  by other  Pan African  organisations  because  of  cultural  differences,  not  only national, tribal  and  ethnic,  but  also  in  economic  and  social  class.  For  one thing, Moody's LCP was essentially a middle-class organisation. Moreover, Africans were suspicious of West Indians, among whom there were interisland rivalries. And within the African group there were further groupings,

such as the West African Students' Union, and the Gold Coast Students. To compound the difficulties of effecting unity, the British-born Blacks were essentially working-class and of lower standing in terms of the social status of the students and professional classes.

Recognising these difficulties, the left-wing black intellectual elite tried to  bring Blacks together in the various Labour and Marxist groups. 57  The 'dictatorial'  Moody  was  saddened  by  the  dissension  in  the  small  black community. 58 The  criticisms  levelled  against  Moody's  leadership  moved him  to  respond  in  various  ways  to  ameliorate  and  threaten  to  resign  or dissolve the League. All these tactical moves helped. Both the League and Moody survived; indeed, he remained President until 1947.

Ladipo  Solanke,  leader  of  the  West  African  Students'  Union,  also wanted to unite Blacks everywhere. Clearly, at least for the first seven years of  the  League's  existence,  WASU  (given  its  radical  student  membership) was  one  of  the  League's  most  serious  rivals.  In  fact,  there  was  much hostility from nationalist organisations in West Africa to the League and its branches. WASU's credibility  was  reflected  in  the  fact  that,  for  a  time,  a fairly successful branch was set up in Sierra Leone.

Moody and Solanke,  unwilling  to  give  ground,  fought  for  the  'moral and financial' support of Blacks in Britain and the colonies. Their differences had become so entrenched that in May 1934, two representatives from the LCP and four from WASU met but failed to reach any agreement. 59 A major bone of contention between the two organisations was Aggrey House, a student hostel, set up by the Colonial Office and the missionary society. WASU proposed that the League should join its boycott of the hostel, stating that failure to agree on this point meant other matters would not be discussed.

In true accommodative fashion, the LCP was prepared 'to go more than half way to meet our sister organisation', but it could not accept the terms of the report. 60 While many  students opposed  Aggrey House  as a paternalistic  gesture  designed  to  monitor  and  control  their  movements, Moody  defended  it.  His  dream,  however,  was  the  establishment  of  a Cultural Centre run by the LCP. 61

The  dispute  over  Aggrey  House  was  a  turning  point  in  the  League's relationship  with  other  groups,  particularly  WASU.  Moody's  religious fervour and success in influencing those in high places, served to alienate

Blacks  who  distrusted  missionaries  and  officials.  In  the  face  of  the  real divide which separated him from so many Blacks, Moody, the 'Accommodative Leader' could do little to effect unity, precisely because he  was  'a  firm  believer  in  the  aristocratic  virtues  and  in  the  essential fairness  of  Britishers  with  breeding'.  Moreover,  he  had  great  faith  in Christianity.  In  the  mid-1930s,  he  tended  occasionally  to  mix  'absolute pacifism' with 'racial messianism'.

For his 'racialism', he received criticism not only from white Christians, but also from the Communists. The Negro Worker , an international monthly magazine,  attacked  the  League.  The  magazine  appealed  to  working  class Blacks  in  Britain  and  was  sold  in  left-wing  bookshops.  In  1931,  the Communist-affiliated, Negro Welfare Association was formed, establishing its headquarters in London. This 'specialised' organisation never acquired a 'mass base'. Indeed, it remained a small group of intellectuals and militant workers  before  it  petered  out  on  the  eve  of  the  Second  World  War.  The continuous propaganda churned out by the NWA and its affiliation with the international Communist  Movement,  brought  pressure  to  bear  on  the accommodative 'race leaders'. The NWA played an active part in organising many large 'Scottsboro' demonstrations in England. 62

Aware  of  the  differences  and  dissension  among  the  black  community leaders, one of the Association's goals was that all organisations should cooperate. Moreover, it attacked the Joint Council to Promote Understanding between  White  and  Coloured  People  in  Britain because  it  failed  to  view race relations in Britain within the imperialist context. The LCP was also taken  to  task  for  not  agitating  for  an  end  to  British  rule.  On  the Aggrey House issue, the NWA joined WASU in denouncing the 'Jim Crow' hostel. On the question of race prejudice in democratic England, The Negro Worker mounted  a  strong  attack  on  Quakers  and  other  pacifists  for  their  lack  of organisation  (among  rank  and  file  workers),  traditionalism  and  lack  of militancy.  Furthermore,  Moody  who  was  always  under  a  strong  Quaker influence,  although  a  Congregationalist,  was  referred  to  as  'Uncle  Tom Moody'. Stung by this jibe, he replied that communism was not the answer. 'We don't want to fight, we are pacifists - but we know what we want.' 63

Between 1929 and 1935 'opposing the colour bar' emerged as the major preoccupation of the various black associations and interested individuals.' 64

## The Cardiff Crisis of 1935 and its consequences

The Cardiff Crisis of 1935 was of major importance. In the face of racial discrimination on the part of the NUS and employers who refused to signon  black  seamen,  an ad  hoc committee  was  formed.  Consequently,  the Communist leader of the Colonial Defence Association was sent to London to seek the support of the LCP for their cause. 65

Already the LCP (under pressure from Communists and Marxists within its own ranks) had been, for two years, discussing the question of aid for the Cardiff  seamen  and  the  overall  condition  of  the  5000  black  people  there. The time had come for the League to act, and it did so with vigour. Apart from its investigative and lobby efforts, as an integral part of their activities, Moody tried to organise a branch in Cardiff, although he and his middleclass  organisation  were  far  removed  (geographically,  economically  and socially) from  the  local Blacks  in Cardiff. Nevertheless,  he  felt his leadership was necessary. Before the 'crisis' he stated that plans were being prepared  by  the  League  to  help  'our  coloured'  working  population,  in Cardiff and throughout the British Isles and would go a long way toward helping to solve the problem of the race. 66

Unfortunately  for  Moody  and  the  LCP,  the  local  leaders  were  not prepared  to  have  a  middle-class  London  organisation  in  control  of  'race relations' in Cardiff. More  emphasis  will  be placed on this crucial relationship between the rank and file workers and the LCP leadership later.

During  and  following  the  Cardiff  Crisis  of  1935  competition  and  cooperation involved individuals representing four main types of organisations: firstly, those with a Christian-humanitarian orientation, composed  mainly  of  white  leaders;  secondly,  those  with  a  Christianhumanitarian  orientation  controlled  by  black  leaders;  thirdly,  Communistinfluenced groups; and fourthly, Pan African groups.

Underlying  these  relationships  however,  even  when  they  were  cooperating, there was 'diffuse tension and latent antagonism'. 67

## Pan Africanism and the Marxists

Pan African sentiments were ever present within the various working class groups  in  Cardiff,  at  this  time.  Such  sentiments  appeared  in  their  most 'extreme'  form  in  the  United  States  in  the  1920s,  with  Marcus  Garvey's 'Back to Africa'  movement,  the  UNIA. 68   Following  the  UNIA's  collapse,

Garvey  was  jailed  in  1925  and  deported  back  to  Jamaica.  Interestingly, Garvey was anti-socialist. In fact, he emphasised the development of black capitalist enterprises. After entering politics in Jamaica, he came to England in  1934.  In  the  hope  of  re-establishing  the  movement,  he  published  a magazine  called The  Black  Man .  In  spite  of  Garvey's  efforts  his  London UNIA had little appeal for black seamen or students. When he died in 1940, there was no branch in existence.

Although Garvey's brand of Pan Africanism declined during the 1930s, Pan African sentiments had become an integral part of black organisations in Britain. One of the most important was a Marxist group led by George Padmore, then a young West Indian intellectual, who edited the Communist journal The Negro Worker . Padmore became disillusioned with the subordination of colonial revolutionary movements to the demands of the Soviet  Union.  Refusal  to  toe  this  line  led  to  his  expulsion  from  the Communist Party in 1935. That same year, when he arrived in London, he joined  forces  with  C.  L.  R.  James,  Ras  Makonnen  and  Jomo  Kenyatta, among  others. Later, they founded the IASB  and  the Pan  African Federation.  And  in  1938,  they  began  to  publish International  African Opinion .

Both  these  organisations  differed  from  the  Liberal-humanitarians  and the Communists. Their goal was the united action of all the organisations in the 'Pan African aggregate'. This meant Pan African solidarity to reinforce the nationalist movements in Africa and the West Indies. These radical Pan Africanists  attacked  the  LCP  'on  principle'.  Moody,  in  true  paternalist fashion, considered them to be 'young and misguided'. As it was, they were anything but misguided. He said, however, they served a useful purpose in raising black consciousness, and thus black protest.

Not surprisingly,  the  attackers  had  themselves  to  face  strong  criticism from the Communists who regarded them as 'renegades and Trotskyists'. 69 In  spite  of  attack  and  counter-attacks,  this  small  group  of  radical  Pan Africanists was in tune with the impatient colonial masses. In effect, they gave voice to Blacks in the Metropole and elsewhere in the Empire.

## The impact of the Second World War

Between the Cardiff Crisis of 1935 and the outbreak of the war, there was closer  co-operation  between  the  League,  a  'wide  segment'  of  the  British Labour  Movement,  and  the  Communist  Party  on  such  issues  as  Spain,

protest against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and racial discrimination in Britain. Significantly, also during this period, the LCP's Cardiff Branch was 'killed off by the opposition, on the one hand, of the Liberal-humanitarian forces and the Communists there, and on the other, by the 'apathy' of the people in the area. Given this position of stalemate there seemed little that anyone (certainly from outside, short of government intervention) could do to  improve  the  black  seamen's  status.  The  prospects  for  their  children seemed graver.

The  depression  of  the  1930s  had  the  effect  of  aggravating  an  already serious  problem  of  colonial  poverty,  disease  and  unemployment.  Not surprisingly, the cumulative effect of these tragedies accelerated the sense of  desperation  among  colonial  peoples.  By  1938,  the  acute  problems  of colonial  workers  led  to  serious  riots  in  the West  Indies, Africa  and  India. Indeed, many of the indigenous labour leaders were also nationalists. Their agitation for self-government (so that the dispossessed masses could at least have  control  of  their  problems)  reflected  the  essential  sentiments  of  Pan African  groups  in  Britain.  Thus,  the  colonial  'disturbances'  became  a rallying point from which the radical Pan Africanists could hammer home their primary demand of black nationalism.

The  League,  through  Moody,  seized  this  opportunity.  Through  its representations a Royal Commission was appointed, and Moody played a part in helping to set the Commission's terms of reference. 70  This was an important step towards achieving other Pan African objectives.

Gradually, the League grew in stature and influence. During the war, it emerged as the most important organisation in British race relations. During the  early  stages  of  the  war,  however,  there  were  important  differences between the LCP and the radical Pan Africanists and the Communists. The advice  given  to  Blacks  by  Pan  Africanists  and  Communists  was  not  to support  the  war  effort  because  they  did  not  have  full  democracy.  More precisely,  when  the  Soviets  were  attacked,  the  Communists  called  upon Blacks  and  colonials  everywhere  to  fight  against  Fascism.  On  the  other hand,  while  the  Pan African  group  gave  'half-hearted'  support  to  the  war effort, the LCP's support was 'whole-hearted'.

In 1943, the LCP had reached the peak of its influence and popularity. The League had also moved to new offices in central London. With its hardwon credibility, Moody the vigilant opportunist, was poised to exploit the war for the benefit of the League. He used a dual strategy, firstly employing

the  soft-soap  technique  of  appealing  to  the  Liberal-humanitarian  'sacred sanctions'; and secondly, by projecting Communism  as  the  dreaded alternative if reforms were not introduced. Moody used the circumstances of the war, for example, the fight against Hitler and Fascism, to highlight his fight against the colour bar. The good behaviour of the black American troops reinforced his arguments.

The war then, brought Pan African activity to a peak. The League had worked closely with a number of black leaders and organisations in spite of their ideological differences.

As the war drew to a close, the LCP concentrated on the problem of the illegitimate  children  of  black  American  soldiers.  When  Moody  died  in 1947, there was a struggle for control between the 'Christian-humanitarian' group  and  a  'more  aggressive'  group.  After  its  successful  Congress,  the radical Pan Africanists had a major influence over the controlling group for about  three  years,  before  the  League  disintegrated.  When  it  was  revived again in 1951, it functioned as a 'very feeble organisation'.

The Pan African Federation also declined. But, it  had  sowed  well  the seeds  of  black  nationalism  in  the  colonies.  During  1947  and  1948,  there were only about 12 organised associations among people of African descent in the London area. One of these groups, a pressure group representing the interests  of  the  black  working  class  (with  a  membership  of  less  than  100 members) was the ambitious Coloured Workers Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Among the other organisations were students' groups (WASU and the East African Students' Association) and a 'rather weak' Caribbean Club, The West African National Secretariat; and of course, the oldest and most influential was the LCP.

On reflection, then, between 1935 and the close of the war, all the major ideological and utopian organisations were concerned with race relations in Britain.  Indeed,  during  the  period  significant  changes  took  place  at  the demographic level. The presence of over 200,000 black American soldiers, and several thousand Africans and West Indians who had come to Britain, meant that more black people than ever before were brought into contact with the British public. 71 This was a rude awakening; a preamble of things to come, as Black and White in a 'world crisis' fought for democracy.

Cardiff's black leaders (1947-48)

During 1947 and 1948, there were three major black leaders in the Cardiff community.  They  were  'Larry'  (also  known  as  'left-wing  leader'),  a Guianese  over  60  years  old.  He  was  Chairman  of  the  Colonial  Defence Association. Jack (also known as Pan African leader), head of the Coloured International Athletic  Club,  was  also  over  60  years  old  and  from  Guiana. The third leader, 'Old Man Jacob' (alias 'Elder Statesman') was president of the United Committee of Coloured and Colonial Peoples Organisations, which was active in 1945 and 1946. A fourth leader, who had suffered a loss of influence was 'Nelson' (the 'Accommodative leader') from Sierra Leone. He  was  president  of  the  Sons  of  Africa. 72 Almost  'hounded  out'  of  the community  (he  lived  outside  Bute  Town),  he  regained  some  of  his  lost influence (though nowhere near enough) by running the Bute Town Social Welfare  Club  in  the  centre  of  the  black  community.  None  of  the  other leaders spoke to him. Each of these men's characters gave an insight as to their role, not as leaders, but as personalities.

Larry came to Cardiff in 1914. He did a 'shore job' during the war, but was basically a seaman who was proud of his affiliation to the Communist Party.  He  seemed obsessed with the 'corruption' of capitalists, the police, public officials, trade union bureaucrats, missionaries, social workers and a few  local  Arab  businessmen.  The  butt  of  many  of  his  jokes  was  the 'corruptness'  of  Islamic  religious  leaders.  A  fierce  protector  of  the  black working class, he was (as were most West Indians) suspicious of Arabs and their collusion with the Colonial Office. For his rivals, the Pan Africanists and  Trotskyites,  his  hatred  was  'uncompromising'.  He  was  particularly critical of Padmore, James and Makonnen. He tagged Padmore a 'Trotskyite', Makonnen, 'a plain racketeer' and James as one of that 'set of renegade Communists'.

Larry founded the Colonial Defence Association in 1927, and during the Crisis between 1927 and 1939, he had become the most popular, aggressive and  vocal  leader  in  the  community.  Later,  in  1947  and  1948,  the  CDA declined. Unfortunately, Larry never gave a full account of the number of dues-paying members in the CDA. Asked what he considered to be the most important  events  during  the  CDA's  existence,  Larry  noted:  the  fight  to restore the nationality of seamen in 1935 and 1936, deputations received by the  Lord  Mayor  protesting  against  differential  relief  allotments  in August 1937, and publicity by the BBC in a broadcast publicising the problems of the people of the Bay in March 1939. 73 According to Larry, the CDA had

never had any salaried officials and its membership fees were one shilling to join and four pence a week dues. He was proud of the several successful compensation claims that the Association made on behalf of its members. At the height of the Crisis, during the 1930s, Larry claimed that the CDA had  a  thousand  cases  on  file.  He  took  the  view  (and  given  the  trend  he seems to be correct) that people respond only when there is an issue that touches them such as the fight for benefits.

Larry's past leadership had brought him respect and admiration from his followers, even among those who resented his 'dogmatic air' and 'tendency to  lay  down  the  line  on  all  issues'.  His  commitment  on  behalf  of  the community was reflected in the number of times he had been arrested. This suffering for the cause elevated him to the status of 'Hero'. His prestige was such  that  although  the  CDA  was  inactive  in  1947  and  1948,  Larry  had around him about five or six men who remained loyal to the Party line.

The other  black  leader  from  Guiana,  Jack,  'The  Pan African  Leader', regarded himself essentially as a race-leader in the Marxist-socialist tradition.  Interestingly,  he  also  held  office  in  the  CDA  and  the  United Committee  of  Coloured  and  Colonial  People's  Organisations.  Formerly  a Communist,  but  still  a  Marxist,  as  one  of  the  officials  of  the  Coloured International Athletic Club (CIAC), he had achieved leadership status.

Occupationally,  Jack  was  involved  in  two  lines  of  business:  as  a salesman of newspapers and running an illegal 'bookie business'. Interestingly, while his illegal business devalued his leadership among some Blacks and all of the white middle-class leaders, it clearly did not weaken his standing among the rank and file in Bute Town. As far as the police was concerned,  Jack  was  cast  again  in  a  dual  role:  that  of  'agitator'  and  'law breaker'. Over the years he had been arrested on several occasions on both counts. Not surprisingly, therefore, he harboured a hatred and suspicion of the police. Few Blacks, certainly among the older men in 'The Bay', would disagree with Jack's hostility towards the police.

Jack's commitment as a Pan Africanist was clear. His intellectual hero was  George  Padmore. And  interestingly  (given  Larry's  antipathy  towards Padmore) Larry labelled Jack a 'Trotskyist'.

Then, there was, in the early 1940s, the Sons of Africa, an association of the Mutual Aid type, which had more than 400 dues-paying members. By 1947 the organisation had disintegrated. Nelson, the founder and president was  blamed. According  to  Nelson  the  club's  decline  began  in  1945.  The

demise of the Sons of Africa led Nelson to found the Bute Town Social and Welfare  Club  which  was  still  functioning  in  1948.  The  social  and  sports activity orientation proved attractive as the Pan African leader, Jack, found after the war when he based his CIAC on members interested in athletics. Nelson placed the emphasis on black youth, particularly the British-born. Music and dancing constituted an integral part of the club's activities.

Unlike  Larry  and  Jack,  Nelson  was  a  conservative,  accommodative leader. While Larry and Jack consistently opposed the colour bar in Britain, Nelson  felt,  'There  is  no  colour  bar  here.  There  is  colour  prejudice  in individuals, but there isn't any colour bar.' He added that although the other black leaders tended to blame the middle and upper classes for prejudice, 'It's only the ordinary people we see in the every day life that don't want us.' 74 Moreover,  Larry  and  Jack  favoured  government  action  to  fight  the colour bar. Nelson disagreed. He felt that the main trouble in The Bay was irresponsible leaders - the 'fools' as he called them.

The last  of  the  notable  community  leaders  during  the  period  was  Old Man  Jacob,  known  as  the  Elder  Statesman.  Unlike  the other black community leaders mentioned Old Man Jacob was a college graduate. In 1945, he had been the head of the United Committee of Coloured Peoples Organisations in Tiger Bay. But hope gave way to disillusionment. He said: 'This is a white man's country, and he may be ever so polite about it, but he lets you know it. No one wanted black engineers in the Valley. There was no colour bar in social intercourse - only some curiosity about the 'blackie' - but to handle important affairs that was different.' 75 To educated Blacks, this  expression  of  race  and  colour  prejudice  would  in  time  become  a recurring and major theme at the workplace.

From the vantage point of holding a number of official posts in every African and West Indian organisation in the community, he summed up the rise and fall of organisations in the Bay thus, 'It's mighty hard to get a host behind you in a place like this.' In 1945, he was the only leader to unite the community. He was chosen Chairman of the United Committee of Coloured and Colonial Peoples Organisations. Unfortunately, the UCCCPO declined. Commenting on this, the Elder Statesman echoed a well-known fact among the black leaders, 'when the pressure is off, we fall apart.'

In effect, the situation during 'normal' times in Tiger Bay was that most people were not members of any associations or in cliques. And leaders had

frequent interaction with each other. On the other hand, during 'crises' in Tiger  Bay,  people  came  together  'around  their  leaders'  and  were  more closely integrated with each other. 76

## The LCP's Cardiff branch

The  Cardiff  Crisis  of  1935  had  brought  together  a  number  of  interested groups, both black and white. Indeed, the local black seamen formed an ad hoc organisation, and the LCP activity supported the seamen. The intention was  that  the  League  should  exploit  the  crisis  by  organising  a  branch  in Cardiff; a deliberate ploy to use the Cardiff Crisis to begin a national fundraising campaign to help the League out of its financial difficulties. Caught in the middle, the black seamen were flanked on the other hand by another organisation  representing  the  local  white  Christian-humanitarian  group. Whatever  the  League's  motivation,  it  was  clear  that  none  of  the  local leaders, black or white, cared for LCP control of race relations in Cardiff. Thus,  the  local  groups  combined  to  get  rid  of  the  London-based  League. Both Larry and Jack took a strong line against the League's opportunism. Moreover, they were keen in competition with the London Square Mission for Coloureds.  This  was  an  on-going  struggle  and  when  the  League intervened Larry gave Moody his support. This gesture of black solidarity was  attacked  by  the  Mission  which  tried  to  weaken  the  newly-organised LCP  branch's  influence.  In  turn,  Larry's  supporters  attempted  to  get  the LCP  branch  leaders  against  the  Mission  and  the  meddling,  troublesome parson.

Moody was in an awkward position. In spite of his need to protect the new branch, as a prominent church leader, he could not pick a fight with the denomination  that  had  financed  the  Nancy  Sharpe  Report  on  the  black community. Surrounded by hostile forces, the new LCP branch leadership turned to the left-wing black leaders for advice.

Public officials were becoming increasingly active. Captain Evans, MP for Cardiff South wrote to the LCP Branch Secretary informing him that Sir John  Harris  of  the  Christian-humanitarian  Anti-Slavery  and  Aborigines Protection  Society  and  the  Africans  in  Europe  Welfare  Fund  was  due  to speak  on  behalf  of  the  seamen  at  the  local  Methodist  Church.  In  the  full knowledge that the black organisations were in need of funds, Evans stated that Sir John's intervention meant that money would be doled out to assist in any ameliorative work connected with the welfare of Blacks in England.

Why England when the Cardiff crisis had become a crying need? It seemed there  was  something  in  the  'Crisis'  for  everyone,  including  several  'very important Englishmen from London' who would 'share the platform'.

Eventually,  the  meeting  did  take  place  and  the  President  reported  to Moody that both Jack and the  Secretary  of  the  Cardiff  LCP  branch  were annoyed  over  the  meeting.  The  President  felt  it  was  a  generally  good meeting in spite of the fact that references made to the LCP were ignored. Non-committal  throughout,  he  ended  feebly,  'The  only  fault  with  the meeting  seems  to  be  the  ignoring  of  the  LCP.  Well,  I  don't  think  I  have more  to  say  except  that  instead  of  expressing  the  opinion  of  various members I have invited them to do so to you themselves, so expect to hear some  more.' 77 Thus,  the  President  had  done  his  bit  following  a  meeting which presented perhaps the greatest threat to the survival of the local LCP Branch.

The  two  black  leaders,  Larry  and  Jack,  participated  in  the  meeting. Generally,  they  were  concerned  with  asking  embarrassing  questions  and they  had  no  intention  of  defending  the  LCP.  More  precisely,  they  were interested  in  exposing  the  link  between  the  church  and  the  shipping interests.

Meanwhile,  a  Cardiff  case  that  was  being  fought  in  London  by  the Communist-affiliated League Against Imperialism moved Moody to get in touch again with the local LCP branch a week later. Following the inquiry as to why the local League branch had not fought the case, he appealed for information.  'I  have  heard  nothing  from  you  recently,'  he  wrote.  On  10 April  1936,  the  branch's  silence  was  broken  when  the  Secretary  wrote  to Moody: 'I am more than sorry that it (the LCP branch) should have gone phut because coloured folks in this town is (sic) in need of organisation and qualified  representation  badly.  But  you  know  better  than  I  do  that  you cannot help a man more than he is willing …' 78

The  inability  of  the  League  to  espouse  causes  that  the  local  black communities  (not  only  in  Cardiff,  but  also  in  London  and  Liverpool) considered  to  be  important  was  a  major  factor  in  the  League's  failure  to mobilise mass support. Here the class aspect of the organisation is clearly reflected. Moreover, the League's financial problems prevented the pursuit of  individual  cases  which,  if  won,  could  well  have  engendered  greater interest. Taken together, these factors, and the combined effect of

competition from the Mission and such leaders as Larry and Jack, put paid to  any  hopes  of  survival  for  the  Cardiff  LCP  branch.  Moreover,  in  time, Moody's 'moderate' approach would be tested as other more radical black groups came into being.

## The League and other black groups

Although during its earlier phase, ideological and philosophical differences separated  the  LCP  from  the  Negro  Workers' Association,  WASU  and  the IASB, on the  issue  of  the  working  class  disturbances  in  the  West  Indies, both Moody and Arthur Lewis showed a willingness to find common cause with other black groups in Britain. Indeed, a number of issues during the 1930s and 1940s led to agitation either jointly or in parallel action.

The  International  African  Service  Bureau  was  organised  in  the  mid1930s by George Padmore, C. L. R. James, Ras Makonnen, Jomo Kenyatta and I. T. A. Wallace. The relationship between the LCP and the IASB was regarded as one of convenience. 79 Although the LCP was recognised as a powerful organisation among Liberals, it had little effect on the IASB since the Bureau had already taken an independent course. The India League ran parallel  with  the  LCP  in  terms  of  its  influential  expatriate  Indian  nucleus which worked closely with Labour Party intellectuals.

The  IASB  emphasised  service  to  the  people  of  African  descent  on educational,  economic,  co-operative  and  political  matters.  Indeed,  the movement towards the founding of the Bureau was the direct result of the Ethiopian crisis. As the movement grew, a rota of Hyde Park Speakers was organised and experts were called in to give an address at one of the many meetings held by the Left. The IASB also published a journal, International African Opinion .

Both  Padmore  and  James  wrote  for  the  journal,  while  Makonnen concentrated on raising money for it. Makonnen was particularly resourceful selling the paper at Halls where leftist and peace meetings were held.  If  his  presence  and  activity  at  these  meetings  meant  embarrassment for the organisers, to him it meant pounds sterling.

Given  the  'convenience'  of  the  relationship,  the  radical  IASB,  led  an attack  on  the  LCP  obstructionists,  who  used  the  balm  of  aid,  and  garden parties  to  seduce  young  men.  WASU  was  also  more  outspoken  than  the

LCP,  providing  a  social  outlet  in  the  form  of  WASU  House,  'a  homely place'  where  one  could  always  get  a  groundnut  chop,  and  where  dances were  held  on  Saturday  nights.  By  comparison,  the  LCP  (now  financially better off) was much more of an administrative centre with two offices on St Andrews  Street,  near  Buckingham  Palace;  a  long  way  from  the  black communities!

An  important  issue  between  the  LCP  and  WASU  was  the  projected Aggrey House which reflected the more suspicious attitudes of WASU to the Colonial Office. About this time, Marcus Garvey was trying to make a come-back  on  the  English  scene,  having  been  expelled  from  the  United States  of  America.  WASU,  particularly  concerned  about  the  need  for  a hostel,  fortunately  received  the  assistance  they  needed.  Indeed  it  was Marcus Garvey 'who made the really generous gift to WASU. He gave that house of theirs  in  Camden Town, and of course this put a number of the more  conservative  members  in  a  difficult  position;  they  were  not  sure whether this rabble-rouser Garvey was an even more dangerous person to associate with than the Colonial Office.' 80 Ladipo Solanke and other more political members  of  the  WASU  Committee  recognised  this  debt  to Garvey. 81

Another black group which related to the LCP was the working class Colonial Seamen's Union. The Union's leader, Chris Jones worked closely with the militant IASB to persuade black seamen to join the union. There was  at  the  time  a  real  fear  among  white  trade  unionists  that  the  Blacks would  act  as  scabs.  This  was  understandable  since  the  victimised  Blacks received no support from the white unions.

The  black  seaman's  position  was  particularly  precarious  in  that  the Union was 'not really a union in the strict sense'. According to Makonnen, the IASB did not want a separate black union. Thus, the CSU functioned more on the lines of a welfare and propaganda grouping in order to bring the  colonial  seamen  together  so  that  they  would  be  persuaded  to  join  the white unions. The intention was to show the weaknesses of remaining ununionised. The  argument  was  that  by  not  joining  the  union  bosses  would always pay lower wages 'and this will separate you from your comrades'.

As leader of the 'Union' Chris Jones was the mouthpiece, representing any  grievances. Apart  from  connections  in  the  LCP  and  the  IASB,  Jones also  had  contacts  in  the  Labour  Party.  Clearly,  his  grass-roots  leadership

was crucial in engendering a sense of confidence among black seamen. On the  question  of  delayed  payment  of  black  seamen's  wages  from  Greek shippers, Jones played the important role of go-between. So impressed was Makonnen by his leadership that he wrote: 'he was looked on as a leader in the same way as some of the outstanding Irish dock leaders in New York.'

Political agitation and economic discontent in the West Indies provided common ground for inter-group co-operation. In particular, the widespread disturbances  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago  (beginning  earlier  with  the  1919 strikes and later with the oilfield 'riots' in 1937, and a series of strikes in Jamaica in 1938) led to united condemnation.

In addition to the LCP's statements, the IASB and the NWA also sent highly  critical  memoranda  to  the  Colonial  Office. 82 They  condemned  the conclusions of the Forster Report. Moreover, both the League and the IASB responded quickly to the strikes in Jamaica and the violence which involved the police and the military.

A further shift in the League's position brought it closer to militancy, as reflected in the radical content of a resolution passed at a meeting held at Memorial  Hall  in  London. 83 Moody  was  particularly  active  at  this  time lobbying  the  Colonial  Office  and  joining  a  deputation  to  see  Sir  Henry Moore.  In  response  to  the  combined  pressure  of  the  LCP,  IASB  and  the NWA,  the  government  appointed  the  Lord  Moyne  Royal  West  India Commission.  This  pressure  was  reinforced  by  the  influential  political, religious and humanitarian contacts of Moody and members of the IASB.

Once  the  Commission  was  set  up,  the  League  concentrated  on  its membership and noted that there was no announcement of any representative of labour on the Commission. One further observation was the 'very serious and significant omission from the terms of reference … of any  provision  for  enquiry  into  the  political  aspect  of  the  life  of  these territories'. 84 Moreover,  the  League's  militancy  was  seen  in  the  firm statement  that  only  when  economic  improvement  is  accompanied  by political freedom 'will the West Indies be freed from the stultification of all progress by those who at present controlling the political machinery prevent even the most elementary change in the lot of the West Indian people'. 85

Further,  the  League  in  conjunction  with  the  IASB  and  the  NWA submitted a joint memorandum to the Moyne Commission. The people on whose behalf these representations were made declared their appreciation,

when Alexander Bustamante (the Labour leader) telegraphed that 'tens of thousands organised Jamaican workers are standing firm behind you'. 86

This  shift  towards  militancy  in  the  League  continued.  When  the  war started,  the  League,  IASB  and  WASU  came  together  on  the  colour  bar issue,  especially  within  the  British Armed  Forces.  They  were  particularly concerned  that  black  citizens of the British Empire  were  not  given commissions as officers.

Significantly, the League had indicated that it could coexist with other groups, in spite of differences in philosophies and ideologies. So much so that  when  Marcus  Garvey  died,  the  LCP Newsletter paid  tribute  to  him, stating 'His work has not been in vain.' 87

During  the  war,  the  League  ceased  to  concern  itself  with  social activities.  From  the  publicity  it  had  received,  increased  support  for  the League came from the West Indian technicians and trainees who came to Britain, and from 'substantial numbers' of Blacks generally who enlisted in the  armed  forces.  Additionally,  there  was  a  massive  presence  of  black American troops.

The  League's next major concern was  discrimination within the Colonial Service. Arthur Lewis noted that 'the League of Coloured Peoples will not rest until this iniquitous system is ended.' 88 Agitation continued. In 1943,  the  League  had  reached  its  'high  water'  mark  of  influence  and effectiveness. As St Clair Drake put it, the League 'was the most important institutional increment in the action-structure oriented toward race relations on the eve of the Second World War', influencing public policy on a wide range of issues involving the West Indies and Africa. 89

Moreover,  by  1943  Moody's  personal  influence  had  grown.  He  was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the London Missionary Society. The League  had  grown  much  stronger  and  had  John  Carter  as  its  full-time Secretary;  and  in  1944,  instead  of  Moody's  home,  new  offices  were established  at  21  Old  Queen  Street  near  St  James's  Park  Underground Station. Most gratifying to Moody was the setting up of two Commissions namely, the Asquith, concerning the development of higher education in the colonies, and the Elliot, to consider the development of Universities in West Africa which included three West Africans in its membership of twelve.

In July 1944 the League convened a conference to draw up a 'charter for  the  League  of  Coloured  Peoples'. Among  its  participants  were Arthur

Creech-Jones. A  year  later,  the  radical  Pan  Africanists  (Padmore,  James, Makonnen and Kenyatta among others) called the historic Fifth Pan African Congress in Manchester. The wide publicity given to the 'Charter' 90 and the arrival of substantial numbers of Africans and West Indians in London, as a direct consequence of the war, moved Moody to find a way of establishing a Colonial Cultural Centre. In spite of his best efforts to raise £50,000, this ambition was never realised.

When  Moody  died  'a  struggle  for  control  broke  out  between  the Christian  humanitarian  group  and  a  more  aggressive  group.  The  Pan African  radicals  exerted  great  influence  on  the  group  for  three  years  and then  the  League  disintegrated,  to  be  revived  in  1951  as  a  very  feeble organisation.' 91 In retrospect this was inevitable for the radical Pan African Federation (incorporating the leaders of the IASB) had grasped the nettle of the post-war colonial situation.

With  Moody's  death  in  1947,  a  'unique'  organisation  and  personality were lost. In one fundamental respect, Moody and Garvey (both Jamaicans) shared a firm belief in the upliftment of the black race. Although Garvey was  a  charismatic  leader,  Moody  was  not.  As  Sam  Morris,  General Secretary  of  the  LCP  from  1945  to  1953  (with  a  short  break),  put  it,  'If Marcus Garvey could be called a visionary, which he was, the name could no  less  be  applied  to  Dr  Moody.'  Indeed,  both  men  possessed  magnetic qualities.  Following  Moody's  death,  many  League  members  continued  to pay  their  subscription,  'not  because  they  were  all  that  interested  in  the League, but because they liked and respected Dr Moody'. In time, this was proven:  the  membership  fell,  enthusiasm  flagged,  and  eventually  the organisation petered out about 1954-55. 92

## Pan Africanists in the twentieth century

Following Celestine Edwards, J. A. Thorne and H. Silvester Williams were the Pan Africanists Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Duse Mohammed Ali and J. R. Archer. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was the son of a medical student from Sierra  Leone  and  a  white  woman.  He  was  taken  care  of  and  raised  by  a white family in Croydon, when his father returned to Africa.

His exceptional gifts as a musician and composer made him famous. By 1900, he was brought into contact with not only cultured but also politically

conscious Blacks. Indeed, he participated in the Pan African Conference in 1900, and was also a member of the Pan African Association. J. R. Archer was also a member of this body.

On his concert  tours  of  the  USA  in  1904,  1906  and  1910,  ColeridgeTaylor  became  more  acquainted  with  the  persecution  and  oppression  of Blacks.  He  valued  highly  the  achievements  of  Blacks.  Moreover,  he  was politically  committed  to  black  self-determination  and  freedom.  He  sided with DuBois's more militant Niagara Movement 93  as opposed to Booker T. Washington's willingness to accept the American racial bias.

Duse  Mohammed Ali,  like  Sylvester  Williams,  also  met  (and  at  least initially)  was  impressed  by  the  Indian  Member  of  Parliament,  Dadabhai Naoroji. Apart from his work on Pan Africanism, he also knew Garvey and worked for the Universal Negro Improvement Association.

Ali was born in Alexandra in 1866 and lived in England between 1883 and 1921. Between 1882 and 1909, he worked as an actor and journalist, and  travelled  widely  to  the  USA,  the  Caribbean,  South  America,  West Africa and, of course, to his native Egypt. 94

While working as a journalist, he became aware of the Indian nationalist Naoroji. In fact, he was glad to meet the first 'coloured' man to be elected to the British House of Commons. As it was, when Naoroji first contested a Parliamentary seat in Holborn in 1886, colour consciousness was evident.

During a period of growing curiosity and questioning of the position of Blacks  in  Britain  and  elsewhere,  Ali,  on  his  doctor's  advice,  sought  to regain  good  health  in  a  warmer  climate.  He  travelled  to  South  America, visiting  Port-of-Spain, Trinidad,  where  he  met  members  of  the  'coloured' middle class, among whom was a group of lawyers. Given that Sylvester Williams was in Trinidad at the time, one might well speculate on a meeting between the man who organised the first Pan African Conference and the African who would later make an important contribution to the development of Pan Africanism.

When the multi-talented Ali returned to Britain, he showed a determination to settle down. He set up in business as a literary agent off Shaftesbury Avenue, London. Gradually, his work as a Pan Africanist took precedence over his theatrical interests. His journalism brought him to the attention of men of influence such as A. R. Orage, editor of the prestigious New Age .  By  then, Ali's  writings  had  already  appeared  alongside  famous

men, and those who were to become so, namely G. B. Shaw, H. G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc and Ezra Pound.

His interest in launching the African Times and Orient Review led him to appeal not only to successful black businessmen, but also to G. B. Shaw, a 'patron of the New Age'. Increasingly, Ali's articles were concerned with the questions of race and colour. He attacked Edwardian racism. Moreover, he sharply criticised British political, religious and social life. 95

An important event in Ali's life was the Universal Races Congress held in London (1911) which symbolised and instilled in him a firm belief that something could and must be done for the black masses. It is this vision that spurred him on to launch his greatest achievements, the African Times and Orient Review and the African and Orient Review published between 1912 and 1920. These reviews, printed in the heart of the Empire, and circulated internationally, had a major influence on the black intelligentsia in Africa, North America and the Caribbean. In spite of financial troubles, the quality of  these  publications  was  'persistently  extremely  high'.  Their  columns supported colonial nationalism and attacked imperialism and racism. Underpinning these themes was the significant call for Afro-Asian solidarity, and more precisely, black economic solidarity or 'economic Pan Africanism'. 96

Moreover,  these  magazines  drew  attention  to Ali's  Fleet  Street  office where many Blacks met in London. It was here in 1912-16 that the young Marcus Garvey had met Duse Mohammed Ali and became conversant with black  politics. 97 The  major  achievement  of  Ali  was  that  in  the  face  of difficulties he had over many years, consistently, through his African Times and Orient Review and African and Orient Review , brought black men and ideas together with far-reaching consequences in developing Pan Africanism and an international black consciousness.

- J. R. Archer was Ali's contemporary, although there is no record of any contact  between  the  two  men. Archer  had  attended  the  1900  Pan African Conference  and,  having  served  as  a  Labour  councillor,  was  elected  as  a London borough mayor in 1913. Archer's career reached its apogee when he  became  first  President  of  the  London-based  Pan  African  Group,  the African Progress Union, in December 1918.

Archer attended both the 1919 and 1921 Pan African Congresses. At the second Congress, he introduced the radical Indian, Shapurji Saklatvala, who

later became the Communist MP for North Battersea. Clearly, Archer who chaired a session of the Congress was involved at a high level in the formal Pan  African movement.  Following  his resignation as Chairman  and President of the APU, Archer was succeeded by Dr Alcindor. 98 Significantly,  thereafter,  Ali  became  one  of  the  members  of  the  new Committee. It is no wonder that Archer and Ali did not get on together, for with Archer's departure, the APU's policy had changed and Ali's economic Pan  Africanism  took  precedence  over  the  Archer-DuBois  emphasis  on political Pan Africanism, 99 at least, in the British context.

By the early 1920s, however, Pan Africanism seemed to have declined and so too did the APU. Up to this point, with few exceptions (if any) it seemed that the Pan Africanists were prepared to work within the imperial framework. Inevitably, as depression set in and the Abyssinian War stirred black militancy, the later 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were to witness a radical change in thinking among Pan Africanists in Britain. This shift in thinking from  the  late  nineteenth  to  the  early  twentieth  century  was  decisive, particularly after the Second World War.

In Britain, while the League of Coloured Peoples had made representations on behalf of black seamen in Cardiff and Liverpool, through the persistent efforts of DuBois, the first Pan African Congress was held in Paris in 1919. 100 Indeed, DuBois was instrumental in planning the first four Congresses,  and  had  a  profound  influence  (through  his  writings)  on  the black movements in Africa, the USA and the West Indies.

Before the fourth PAC was held in 1927, Garvey's Black Zionism had collapsed.  Ideologically,  DuBois  and  Garvey  were  diametrically  opposed. Pan  Africanism,  DuBois  style,  differed  from  Garveyism  in  that  'it  was never  conceived  as  a  Back  to Africa  Movement,  but  rather  as  a  dynamic political  philosophy  and  guide  to  action  for Africans  in Africa  who  were laying  the  foundations  of  national  liberation  organisations'. 101 Another source  of  conflict  between  the  two  men  was  the  concept  each  had  of political philosophies and economic systems. DuBois was against Garvey's Back to Africa movement. Indeed, he opposed transportation of American Blacks  back  to  Africa,  but  was  strongly  in  favour  of  complete  selfgovernment  for  Africans  in  Africa  organised  on  the  basis  of  socialism. Thus, national self-determination, individual liberty and democratic socialism  were  the  essential  elements  of  the  Pan  Africanism  of  DuBois,

while  his  influence  was  exercised  largely  through  his  writings  and  in  the classroom, as a teacher of economics and social history. On the other hand, Garvey, the agitator and organiser had generated mass appeal as an orator. In  spite  of  these  differences,  both  Garvey's  and  DuBois's  Pan Africanism had  become  well-known  in  Africa  and  among  Blacks  in  the  diaspora. However, while Garvey's Back to Africa movement had a meteoric rise and decline,  DuBois  was  at  the  centre  of  the  planning  of  the  first  four Congresses. Garvey had appealed to the black man's emotions, DuBois to his  intellect.  Indeed,  at  this  time,  many  British  intellectuals  sympathised with Pan Africanism. When the Third PAC met in London in 1923, Lord Olivier,  Professor  Harold  Laski  and  H.  G. Wells,  were  among  the  British Socialists  to  address  the  Congress. 102 Moreover,  J.  Ramsay  MacDonald, Chairman of the Labour Party sent his greetings to the Congress. 'Anything I can do to advance the cause of your people on your recommendations', he wrote to DuBois. 'I shall always do gladly.' 103 Unfortunately, the Africans' great  expectations  of  MacDonald  and  of  impending  improvements,  were not fulfilled. It was  clear, however,  that these gestures of goodwill symbolised recognition of the black man's cause.

What was restated at the  fourth  PAC  was  the  right  of Africans  in  the diaspora  to  be  governed  under  the  elective  principle,  thus  giving  them  a voice in government. Indeed, this had been one of the basic demands of the PAC. Significantly, at this Congress representatives of women's organisations constituted the majority of the American delegates. Thereafter, as economic depression engulfed the United States of America, with  devastating  effects  throughout  the  West  Indies,  Africa  and  Asia, Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia engendered greater interest among Africans  in  international  affairs.  Following  Mussolini's  act  of  aggression against  Abyssinia,  the  International  African  Friends  of  Abyssinia  (IAFA) came into being with the central purpose of arousing sympathy and support for the victims of fascism.

Predictably, the Ethiopian war rankled deeply among Africans. Cynicism  towards  the  great  powers  was  aroused  among  black  peoples everywhere. Africans felt they could not rely on Europeans for protection; they had to protect themselves from further aggression.

The  failure  of  the  League  of  Nations  to  respond  to  the  Ethiopian Emperor's appeal for help put the onus on Pan Africanists to renew their

efforts at Pan African organisation. Consequently, the International African Friends of Abyssinia Society joined forces in 1937 with others such as T. R. Makonnen  to  form  the  International  African  Service  Bureau.  The  chief officers of the Bureau were George Padmore, Chairman; Wallace Johnson, General Secretary (also a major West African trade unionist); Chris Jones, Organising  Secretary; C. L. R. James,  Editorial Director; and  Jomo Kenyatta,  Assistant  Secretary.  Makonnen  who  was  Honorary  Treasurer helped to launch the International African Opinion and was also responsible (through  his  business  dealings  as  a  restauranteur)  for  raising  most  of  the funds  in  making  possible  the  Fifth  Pan  African  Congress.  Moreover, Makonnen  established the journal Pan  Africa which constituted the 'principal  medium'  in  furtherance  of  the  ideology  of  Pan  Africanism throughout the black world.

The  years  before  the  outbreak  of  the  Second  World  War  were  most stimulating and constructive in the history of Pan Africanism. In fact, there was  a  growing  tide  of  anti-fascist  feeling.  This  posed  an  ideological challenge  to  the  Pan  African  Congress  of  1945.  It  had  to  meet  the communist  opportunists,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  racist  doctrines  and fascists,  on  the  other.  Moreover,  it  had  to  defend  the  principles  of  Pan Africanism, encapsulated in the fundamental right of black men to be free and independent of those who supported acceptance of the status quo in the interest of power politics.

Coincident with this period, was the emergence of African personalities in colonial nationalist movements. These intellectuals studied and evaluated the  prevailing  doctrines  (liberalism,  socialism,  communism,  anarchism, imperialism,  fascism)  as  they  related  to  the  cause  of  Pan  Africanism. Through  this process, upon  the foundation laid by DuBois  and  his predecessors,  these  leaders  forged  a  programme  of  dynamic  nationalism, constituting 'African traditional forms of organisation with Western political party methods'. 104

By the time of  the  Fifth  Pan African  Congress  held  in  Manchester  in 1945, although DuBois (the 'father' of Pan Africanism) was in the Chair, it was  the  radicals  (Padmore,  James,  Makonnen,  Nkrumah,  Kenyatta,  and Wallace  Johnson,  among  others)  of  the  Pan African  Federation  who  took charge  of  the  Congress.  By  then,  it  had  become  clear  that  a  new  path  to black nationalism was the adoption of an anti-imperialist line. We turn now

to the men and ideas that came together, after the First World War, to assist the development of a black radical ideology.

## 6 The Development of a Black Radical Ideology

## The black intelligentsia in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s

Socialist movements  and  socialist  thought  in  Britain  during  the  late eighteenth and throughout the nineteenth centuries have helped to consolidate  the  English  working  class  and  prepare  them  for  electoral politics in the twentieth century. Increasingly, the British working class had, during the 1920s and 1930s developed strong trade union links.

Marxism,  having  found  expression  in  the  1917  Revolution  in  Russia through Marxist-Leninism, found more ready acceptance among  the English middle-class and upper class liberals and socialists than among the English  working  class.  Class  cleavages  (and  a  native  distrust  of  foreign ideas  and  workers),  deeply  ingrained  in  English  social  values,  prevented widespread working class acceptance of the British Communist movement.

By about 1930, however, British Marxism and British socialism became strong influences in Labour Party and Independent Labour Party politics. In spite  of  these  seemingly  liberal  influences,  entry  of  black Africans,  West Indians  and  Asians  into  Britain  was  difficult.  Indeed,  more  so  than  the

access afforded by France to black French subjects. Thus, many of the black 'ideologues, theorists and activists' who arrived in Britain did so indirectly. For  example,  George  Padmore, Azikiwe,  Nkrumah  and  P.  K.  I.  Seme  of South Africa came to Britain from the United States of America, and Ras Makonnen came via Denmark. 1

If 'reds' were  feared, Blacks who  ventured  outside the colonial elementary school-based education system for higher education and training in  the  Metropole  were  particularly  marked. As  it  was,  most  of  those  who found their way to Britain during this period were from the colonial middle classes. This  included  many  of  the  Pan  Africanists  such  as  Thorne, Sylvester Williams, Duse Ali, Moody, Padmore, Makonnen and James who were among those committed to black politics in Britain.

By  1931,  this  black  intelligentsia  had  achieved  much.  Duse  Ali  had established  his  influential African  Times  and  Orient  Review (with  which Garvey was connected before setting-up his UNIA) and Makonnen had set up  the  Pan  African  Publishing  Company.  Moreover,  between  1900  and 1931,  five  social  and  political  organisations  were  formed:  the  Afro-West Indian Literary Society, the Ethiopian Progressive Association, the Union of Students of African Descent, WASU and the League of Coloured Peoples. Taken together, this initiative prepared them for the events of the 1930s. 2

Of this group, Padmore was involved with the Third International, until 1933; James was 'the most active' black Trotskyist; R. Palme Dutt was the leading  theorist  in  the  Communist  Party  of  Great  Britain  (CPGB).  This black  nucleus  had  left-wing  support  from William  Gallagher  (Communist MP), Fenner Brockway, Reginald Reynolds and Reginald Sorensen of the ILP.

Although  these  Blacks  were  committed  to  the  broad  Left,  the  Third International's disbanding  of  the  International  Trade  Union  of  Negro Workers in 1933 and the Soviet Union's trade in war materials with Italy during the Italian-Ethiopian War brought about serious questioning of their alignment with European Communists. Thus, the black ideologues accepted Pan  Africanism  while  retaining  a  Marxist  approach  in  their  critique  of capitalism and imperialism.

For most of these two decades, the black intelligentsia (who viewed the problem in global terms) intervened on behalf of black workers in Britain and in the colonies. For example, the doctors, barristers and one restaurant

and club-owner, among  them,  provided essential social welfare and professional  services  for  the  black  and  white  working  classes  in  the 'industrial ghettoes'. The intellectuals were aware that these services were being rendered at 'the centre of gravity'. Within the Empire, as this black middle-class  elite  saw  it,  there  were  'two  Englands  -  the  England  of  the colonies and that of the Metropolis'. 3

It was clear that among this black intelligentsia only a few had come for 'larger  political  purposes',  such  as  Makonnen  and  Padmore.  Earlier,  H. Sylvester  Williams  and  later,  C.  L.  R.  James  both  acquired  their  politics while in Britain. These men formed the nucleus 'of that generation of black intellectuals'  who  had  focused  attention  on  Britain.  Their  goals  were decolonisation and black liberation.

Makonnen, with Padmore, was one of the central organisers of the Fifth Pan African Congress held in Manchester in 1945, which brought together DuBois,  Padmore  and  Nkrumah,  the  last  time  they  met  as  'ideologues without power'. Having set up a publishing house which he registered as the Pan African Publishing Company Limited, Makonnen first published a pamphlet by Jomo Kenyatta and later one by Eric Williams, The Negro in the  Caribbean .  He  also  started  a  bookshop  called  the  'Economist'  which catered  for  Manchester  University  students.  While  this  was  not  a  'race bookshop'  Makonnen  sent  many  Oxford  University  Press  publications  to African  countries.  Books  about  Blacks  were  given  a  'big  push'.  For instance,  Kenneth  Little's Negroes  in  Britain , George  Padmore's How Britain Rules Africa and Eric Williams's Capitalism and Slavery . 4

Makonnen  who  came  to  Britain  in  1935  was  aware  of  the  debt  that colonial radicals owed to the radical traditions of the English working class, namely  free  speech  and  a  free  press.  Whether  or  not  he  understood  that these traditions were established by artisans and working classes during the late  eighteenth  and  early  nineteenth  centuries,  he  was  clear  about  the benefits accruing to black radicals such as himself.

James's  English  public-school  upbringing  in  Trinidad  led  to  his  two obsessions of cricket and English literature which, as he later discovered, were  expressions  of  the  same  social  order. As  a  developing  Marxist,  the conjunction (and relationship) of culture, class power  and  economic dominance, as he put it, 'hit me as it would have hit few of the students of society and culture in the international organisation to which I belonged'. 5

Put simply, James understood the relationship between politics and organised games. 6

Whatever were James's preconceptions of English society, his arrival in the  early  1930s  brought  him  face  to  face  with  reality.  For  one  thing,  the English working classes 'had become detached from identifications with the ruling class. English workers were militantly unpersuaded that their future and that of the ruling classes were identical'. Indeed, they would no longer fight imperialist wars. According to Cedric Robinson:

And despite the repeated betrayals of the leaderships of the Labour Party  and  the  trade  union  movement,  the  material  crises  of  world capital and the political incompetence of the ruling classes provided a  basis  for  a  certain  integrity  in  the  working  class  movement. The Labour  Party  in  disgrace  in  1931,  once  again  received  massive support (8½ million votes) from the labouring classes in 1935. The organised  Left,  however,  was  not  to  be  a  beneficiary.  The  CPGB, never  a  mass  party  in  any  sense,  was  further  weakened  by  the Comintern, directly and indirectly. 7

Given  a  left  wing  in  disarray,  according  to  James,  the  radical  black intelligentsia was forced to liberate itself by its own means. Padmore and Makonnen disagreed with  this  view. This  difference  of  opinion  provoked new ideas and new writings. Padmore wrote How Russia Transformed Her Colonial  Empire ,  Eric  Williams, The  Negro  in  the  Caribbean ,  Kenyatta, Kenya -  Land of Conflict ,  and  James, The Black Jacobins .  The first three were  Pan  Africanist  proposals  for  national  independence,  while  James's book,  'a  declaration  of  war  for  liberation',  also  dismissed  'the  need  for trusteeship of either the left or the right'.

Before the 1945 Pan  African Congress, Padmore  had made  an ideological  shift  from  Communism  and  the  'Negro'  to  Pan  Africanism. 8 Garvey's Back to Africa movement in the 1920s received enough support in the  United  States  to  be  able  to  resist  Communist  infiltration.  In  their frustration,  the  Communists  conceived  the  idea  of  a  'Black  Republic'. Padmore saw this 'fantastic scheme' as a cohesive force which could bring together disparate elements within Garvey's movement. 9

By  1930,  Padmore  was  at  the  forefront  of  international  Communist activity. His role was the supervision of the black diaspora. More precisely, he  was  not  only  responsible  for  the  recruitment  of  young  colonials  to Moscow,  but  also  gained  election  to  the  Moscow  Soviet,  participated  in party  work  in  Africa  and  had  been  on  the  reviewing  stand  with  Stalin. Given  this  commitment,  he  was  opposed  to  Garveyism,  Pan Africanism, national  reformism  and  trade  union  reformism. 10 In  effect,  this  meant opposition to DuBois and Garvey, among others.

Padmore was now faced with the major dilemma in the political thought of the colonial intelligentsia. As one commentator observed, 'Padmore had thus begun to rethink the classical theories of Marxism on the problem of working  class  solidarity. He  had  already  begun  to  rebuke  Profintern supporters  and  sections  of  the  'white'  working  class  for  their  failure  to recognise the specificity of the negro problem.' Garveyism, he felt, was the major battle facing Negro workers in America and in the African and West Indian  colonies.  Moreover,  DuBois  and  his  followers  were  dismissed  as 'office-seekers'  and  demagogues'.  In  sum,  Padmore  saw  the  African  as suffering from a major disability in terms of class and race. 11

Given that the failure of the black intelligentsia was, in part, the failure of  Marxism to accommodate the problem of minorities, it is clear that in Marx's writings, 'a separate theory on minorities would have constituted a serious breach with the basic postulate of the primacy of economic factors on the consciousness of man and its concomitant of the 'class' struggle as the motivating factor in history'. 12

Since Marx stated, 'White labour can never be free while black labour is enslaved', Marxists have been unable successfully to integrate 'race' with 'class'. Eventually, the competing issues of 'nationalism' and 'class' led to Padmore's break with the Soviet Union in June 1934, and the beginning of his career as a Pan Africanist. He chose this course rather than accept the call 'to endorse the new diplomatic policy of the Soviet Government, but to put  a  break  upon  the  anti-imperialist  work  of  its  affiliate  sections  and thereby  sacrifice  the  young  national  liberation  movements  in  Asia  and Africa'. 13

The years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Second World War coincided  with  what  was  known  on  the  Left  as  the  'anti-Fascist  Popular Front Period'. According to Padmore,

This period was one of the most stimulating and constructive in the history  of  Pan Africanism.  It  was  then  that  Pan Africanism  had  to meet the ideological challenge from the Communist opportunists on the  one  hand and the racist doctrines of the Fascists, on the other, and  to  defend  the  programme  of  Pan  Africanism  -  namely,  the fundamental right of black men to be free and independent and not be humbugged by those who preached acceptance of the status quo in the interest of power politics.

By the end of the 1930s, after two decades of thought and activity in Britain, the black intelligentsia was poised to take their slowly crystallising ideas of education, organisation and involvement of the masses back to the colonies.  But,  in  order  to  do  this  they  had  to  raise  the  level  of  black consciousness. This  they  attempted  to  do  during  the  1930s  and  1940s.  In fact,  these  decades  constituted  an  important  transitional  period  when  the mood  of  the  small  black  community  moved  from  a  large  measure  of grudging  acceptance  to  rising  consciousness  and  radicalism.  An  integral part  of  this  process  of  a  heightened  awareness  was  the  role  of  London's black press. Among the more important publications were WASU, the Negro Worker, The Keys, The Black Man, The African Sentinel and International African Opinion ,  the LCP's Newsletter, The New Times &amp; Ethiopian News (edited by the Pankhursts) and Pan Africa . 14

This  body  of  writing,  broadly  circulated  during  this  20-year  period, helped to create new attitudes and approaches in the postwar world. Black radicalism  was  in  the  ascendant.  Moreover,  heightened  awareness  of national  identity  clarified  the  fact  that  political  freedom  was  not  enough; economic self-sufficiency was also of primary concern. Furthermore, from this composite  of  approaches  (reflecting  a  multiplicity  of  views)  was crystallised the urgent need to 'educate, organise and involve the masses' towards  achieving  the  ultimate  goal  of self-government  and  national independence.  Freedom  from  colonial  domination  was  the  major  theme. Two of the chief advocates of achieving this goal were Shapurji Saklatvala (the  Indian  nationalist  and  Communist)  and  the  black  radical  George Padmore. First we turn to Indian nationalism and the Home Rule League advocates, particularly Joseph Baptista.

## Indian nationalism

Joseph Baptista: 'father' of the home rule movement in India

Since Raja Rammohun Roy's representations in the nineteenth century there has  been  a  list  of  outstanding  Indians  who  helped  to  engender  a  growing nationalism  among  the  Indian  people.  Among  them  were  Phirozeshah Mehta,  Dadabhai  Naoroji,  Gokhale,  Tilak,  Lala  Lajpatrai,  Surendranath Mbanerji and Shrinivas Shastri Jayakar, who preceded the later champions (Gandhi and Nehru) of Indian nationalism.

Among the  outstanding  men  who  worked  towards  self-government  is the  comparatively  less  well-known  Joseph  Baptista  now  recognised  by some as the 'Father' of the Home Rule Movement in India. Baptista was the link  both  between  different  levels  of  leadership  and  between  India  and England.

The  educated  Indian  elite  which  had  remained  aloof  during  the  1857 mutiny  had  ambiguous  feelings  about  British  rule  in  India.  By  1870, however,  the year of 'famines and  agrarian unrest, trouble between landlords and tenants, between workers and moneylenders', 15 the nationalists criticised the government's failure to reduce wasteful expenditure  and  for  not  acting  to  restore  the  equilibrium  of  the  rural population of India. By contrast, this was a time of literary and intellectual activity  which  helped  to  engender  higher  aspirations  in  the  succeeding generation.

In  the  1870s,  Baptista  belonged  to  a  group  of  people  known  as  the 'angry  young  men'. Among this group of middle-class agitators  were  the 'Moderates'  and  the  'Extremists'.  Their  differences  were  fundamental  in aim and methods. 16 The 'Moderates' claimed social equality and participation  in  the  British  government  in  India,  placing  their  reliance  on English history and English political ideas. They emphasised the need for political apprenticeship under British rule. On the other hand, the 'Extremists'  demanded  social  equality  and  political  emancipation  as  a fundamental  right.  They  rejected  England's  mission  in  India,  and  the constitutional  agitation  of  the  Moderates,  and  stressed  apprenticeship  as being an acceptance of the end of political servitude. Indeed, they called for self-reliance and self-apprenticeship through Swadeshi , boycott and passive resistance. 17

In  1914,  the  Indian  National  Congress  passed  a  resolution  calling  for 'measures as may be necessary for the recognition of India as a component part  of  the  Federated  Empire  in  the  full  and  free  enjoyment  of  the  rights belonging to that status'. Further, speakers and writers helped to spread the message of the liberation movements in the West, for example, the Home Rule  Movement  of  Ireland  and  the  movement  of  Italian  unification  and freedom.  In  June  of  that  same  year,  Tilak  was  released  (after  being incarcerated by the British authorities) and with Baptista's help made efforts to start a mass Home Rule agitation. Tilak's three-point programme was (i) the  Congress compromise; (ii) the reorganisation of the Nationalist Party; and (iii)  the  setting  afoot  of  a  strong  agitation  for  Home  Rule. 18 Baptista proved  to  be  an  able  co-ordinator.  Under  his  presidentship,  nationalists attended a conference in Poona which demanded Home Rule. Consequently,  the  Home  Rule  League  Headquarters  was  established  at Poona.

Both Tilak  (at  that  time  60  years  old)  and  Baptista  started  the  Home Rule League on 23 April 1916, six months before Mrs Annie Besant started hers. Mrs Besant was a tireless worker in support of Indian nationalism. At the  Indian  National  Congress  session  in  1915,  she  had  tried  to  get  the support of the Congress to form her own Home Rule League. In this, she met resistance from Bannerjea who argued that formation of a Home Rule League would 'overlap and weaken the Congress'. A year later, militancy for  Home  Rule  had  increased. At  the  Lucknow  Congress  the  Extremists, Tilak,  Gandhiji,  Mrs  Besant  and  Bipin  Chandra  Pal  won  control  of  the Congress from the Moderates. Tilak voiced the Congress demand 'for India to be a self-governing Dominion in which Indians would have control over the Central Legislative Council and complete Indian control over all matters in the provincial governments'. 19

Significantly,  while  Baptista  and  Besant  were  engaged  in  setting  up their Home Rule Leagues, Gandhi hoped to establish a new socio-economic order in India based on truth and love; a saint-like approach envisaging 'the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth'. In fact, as far as the Home Rulers  were  concerned,  the  atmosphere,  generated  in  the  country  by  the non-violent  movement  launched  by  Gandhi  was  most  unfavourable  to them. 20

Against this background then, Joseph Baptista, (later known as 'Kaka' uncle)  became  one  of  the  foremost  advocates  of  the  Indian  Home  Rule Movement.  He  was  born  on  17  March  1864  in  Bombay's  East  Indian community. He was educated at Bombay and Cambridge Universities, and had taken part in politics in England since 1895. After being called to the bar at Gray's Inn and enrolling as an advocate of the High Court at Bombay in 1899, he became Professor at the Government Law School in Bombay.

On  his  return  to  India  in  1899,  he  quickly  realised  the  political stagnation  in  Bombay  and  gravitated  towards  Sir  Phirozeshah  Mehta  and Tilak.  He  was  particularly  drawn  to  Tilak.  According  to  his  biographer, Baptista  may  be  claimed  to  have  been  the  first  Home  Rule  advocate  in India. In 1900, he suggested to Tilak that a Home Rule League should be formed. Tilak felt the idea was too premature. Both men met again in 1906 at  the  Congress  in  Calcutta.  In  1908, Tilak  was  imprisoned  for  six  years, and  in 1909,  the Morley-Minto  Reforms  were  introduced.  After  the outbreak  of  war  in  1914,  a  series  of  events  stimulated  the  dormant  and latent nationalism of India. Immediately Tilak was released from prison in 1915, he called a Provincial conference at Poona. Baptista was invited to preside  and  took  this  opportunity  to  suggest  again  the  establishment  of  a Home Rule League. This time Tilak agreed, but added, 'Yes, but would it be right to raise the issue of Home Rule now while the war is raging?' Finally, in 1916, the Home  Rule  League  was  inaugurated at the Belgaum Conference, and became the first such body to be established. Baptista was elected President of the League which he led for several years. Indeed, he was the first to see the possibilities of British Labour Party connections in helping to further the cause of Indian nationalist aspirations. Thus, in 1917, he  arrived  in  England,  'as  the  vanguard  of  the  Indian  delegation'.  His appeals  to  the  Labour  Party  were  successful  to  the  extent  that  the  party pledged  itself  to  support  the  principle  of  self-determination. 21 Baptista's confidence in the Labour Party was based on his belief that the party was democratic in principle and in practice.

Moreover, he was encouraged when Annie Besant followed his lead by forming her own Home Rule League. The agitations of both organisations helped to disseminate the idea of Home Rule which spread like wildfire. In 1916  the  Home  Rulers  were  able  to  capture  the  Indian  Congress  at Lucknow. Although Baptista recognised the national status and leadership of Gokhale, his political hero and guru was B. G. Tilak. It is fitting that both

Baptista and Tilak should come to Britain to work as ambassadors of the Indian Home Rule Movement.

In  spite  of  the  growing  awareness  of  nationalist  feeling  in  India, Baptista never lost sight of the importance of support from British Labour. Thus,  at  the  Annual  Conference  of  the  Home  Rule  League  in  1917,  a resolution was passed urging the necessity and urgency of sending a strong deputation of representatives and influential men to England. Tilak's choice was Baptista. 22 About the same time, Annie Besant announced the need for support  for  her  own  Movement  in  England.  Consequently,  Ramswamy Aiyar came to Britain.

Baptista,  the  first  man  to  go  to  England  for  the  noble  cause  of  Home Rule agitation, had the task of making propaganda for Home Rule in India among  the  British  people.  Both  Aiyar  and  Baptista  had  to  explain  the Congress-Home  Rule  Scheme  to  the  English. Among  the  London  Home Rule  League's  prominent  members  who  held  meetings  and  interviewed newspaper editors  were  George  Lansbury,  Lady  Emily  and  Graham  Pole. One  of  Lansbury's  meetings  was  with  Montagu,  Secretary  of  State  for India. He suggested Annie Besant's release from internment. Moreover, the London  branch  of  the  League  also  arranged  meetings  for  Baptista  who spoke for Besant's release.

Soon after arriving in London in September 1917, Baptista made close contacts  with  the  Labour  Party  and  British  working  class  leaders.  He  not only addressed meetings, but also wrote articles for the Herald .  He  wrote regularly to Tilak, informing him in October 1917 that he had accompanied Lansbury to six important centres and had spoken on Home Rule and that he was attending the Annual Conference of the Labour Party as the Indian Home Rule League's representative.

Baptista continued to make good progress. There was a great demand from labour leaders for him to speak. He was aware of 'a splendid feeling in favour of the union of India and the British people', and that there was an inquisitiveness  among  the  English  about  India's  political  problems.  Thus, he again underlined the need for 'half a dozen influential Indian volunteers for propagating the Home Rule movement in England'. 23

With  these despatches, Tilak had grown  even  more  enthusiastic. Simultaneously,  he  placed  much  importance  in  educating  English  voters and on the creation of favourable public opinion for the Indian Home Rule

Movement.  For  this,  the  time  was  right  in  that  the  English  were  already discussing  India's  needs  and  rights.  Having  declared  his  position  as  a foreign  agitator,  it  would  have  been  incredible  if  Baptista's  movements were not monitored by the forces of law and order. He reported to Tilak that the  police  attended  all  his  lectures  and  passed  on  their  reports  to  the government.

Outside London, his lecture tour took him to Glasgow, Dundee, parts of Lancashire  and  Hull,  where  Labour  Party  leaders  passed  a  resolution  in favour  of  Indian  Home  Rule. Although  he  was  confident  that  'when  the Labour Party is on our side …we shall get complete Home Rule', even then he felt that this agitation for Home Rule must continue in England.

Finally, in accordance with Baptista's wishes, it was decided to send a large  deputation  to  England  including Tilak,  Khaparde,  Karandikar,  Bipin Chandra Pal and Kelkar. Much was expected of this deputation. When they arrived in Madras (on their way to England) Annie Besant received them, accompanied by prominent Congressmen and Home Rulers. Tilak addressed the 20,000 people who showed their support. He told them that the deputation was not going to England to appeal to the generosity of the British people, but rather to tell the British to save the Empire by trusting India  instead  of  Japan,  and  granting  her  Home  Rule. When,  however,  the deputation reached Colombo, Tilak was informed that their passports were cancelled. This evoked protests from all parts of India. Tilak, in particular, was black-listed. He was not invited to the War Conference called by the Viceroy at Delhi. The victimisation of the Home Rule Movement leaders, Tilak  and  Besant,  who  were  excluded  from  the  Conference,  resulted  in numerous public meetings throughout India in protest. In response, on 22 April 1918, Tilak, Besant and their followers signed a manifesto which was sent  to  the  British  government,  stating  that  'if  India  is  to  make  great sacrifices for the Empire, it must be as a partner in the Empire and not a Dependency'. 24

Baptista felt  it  was  fortunate  that  he  was  in  England,  'otherwise  there would have been nobody to take India's side'. Later on, however, Tilak was permitted to visit England in connection with the Valentine Chirol case, on the condition that he would not engage in political agitation in England. He arrived in London on 19 October 1918. While in England, Tilak was elected President  of  the  Indian  National  Congress.  He  could  not  accept  this,  but

when  the  delegations  of  the  Home  Rule  League  and  the  Indian  National Congress went to England, Tilak became a member of both.

With Tilak in  England,  Baptista  felt  great  confidence  that  their  Home Rule  mission  could  be  achieved.  Tilak  met  the  British  Prime  Minister, Lloyd George, and got the ban on his political work removed. Moreover, before the elections, he ensured that the British electorate was adequately supplied with important pamphlets on Indian politics. During the election campaign, the Labour Party repeatedly pledged its support for Indian Home Rule. They suffered a landslide defeat, to Baptista and Tilak's disappointment.

Later, when the Montagu-Chelmsford Reform Scheme was announced, Tilak was disappointed. It was not even a close approximation to Swaraj . He  regarded  the  proposals  as  'only  one  more  hesitant  step  in  the  long process toward self-determination'.

What irritated Baptista was the progress by stages approach adopted by the  British  government.  He  reminded British readers that their parliament did not apply it in the case of the abolition of slavery.

Tilak sent Baptista and Karandikar (who had accompanied him) back to India.  Tilak  took  Baptista's  advice  that  closer  friendly  contacts  with  the Labour Party should be developed. For the rest of his stay in England, his concentration on political work, 'one mad rush', was spent largely attending social  functions  and  holding  political  discussions  with  Indian  and  British friends. He returned to India in 1919.

Thus, after doing more substantial work in England (during a period of 20  months)  than  any  of  his  predecessors,  Baptista,  the  President  of  the Home Rule League was back in India. His work with the Labour Party was 'so successful' that the Party was 'now irrevocably committed' to the cause of winning Home Rule for India. His achievement was one of the greatest landmarks in the history of India, and one cannot be too grateful to him for that. The Indians were unanimous in their praise for his work in England.

After Tilak's death, Mahatma Gandhi joined the All India Home Rule League  and  became  President.  Thus  his  splendid  isolation  ended.  He explained that the causes which he wanted to promote through the Home Rule League were Swadeshi , Hindu-Muslim unity with special reference to the Khilafat and linguistic redistribution of the Provinces. He was particularly careful that he should not be misunderstood. Since he belonged to no party, he promised that he would not treat the All India Home Rule

League as a party organisation. Indeed, he was also aware of the League's constitution  but  never  argued  that  he  would  try  to  mould  the  League's policy  to  make  the  Congress  retain  its  national  character.  He  was  most concerned about winning the confidence of League members. But, changes were inevitable. Gandhi felt that the Home Rule League had to match the changed political situation in India. Consequently, a sub-committee, appointed  in  early  September  1920,  to  revise  the  League's  constitution, recommended certain changes which were made on 3 October 1920. The Home  Rule  League  was  re-named Swarajya  Sabha .  Among  those  who opposed this  move  was  M. A.  Jinnah. With  time,  as  the Swarajya Sabha (Home  Rule  League)  lost  its  identity,  it  merged  into  the  Indian  National Congress.  As  the  movement  for  Home  Rule  became  a  spent  force,  the prestige of Baptista also declined. 25

Tilak's  death,  then,  was  an  irreparable  loss  to  Baptista.  The  new leadership  of  Gandhi,  opposed  to  some  aspects  of  the  political  ideal  of Baptista,  led  to  the  rise  of  Gandhi  and  the  eclipse  of  Baptista  in  Indian politics. This was the turning point in Baptista's political career. In the 1924 elections  he  was  elected  for  North  Bombay,  to  the  Bombay  Legislative Council, and in 1926 was elected (uncontested) to the Bombay Legislative Assembly. 26 He remained an advocate of Dominion status and the British connection.  He  dissociated  himself  from  unconstitutional  methods  which were employed in the cause of political progress.

Moreover, Baptista had devoted much time in the service of the Indian trade unions. He was not only President of several unions, but also one of the founders of the All India Trade Union Congress in 1921. Furthermore, in  1924  he  was  the  Labour  delegate  to  the  Geneva  Labour  Conference, under  the  League  of  Nations  constitution.  After  1926,  his  failing  health forced  his  retirement  from  active  politics.  Whatever  influence  he  had  in both  politics  and  civic  affairs  was,  in  the  face  of  rising  militancy  and unconstitutional  methods  in  achieving  the  goal  of Swaraj ,  greatly  at  risk. Nonetheless, as a Home Ruler - indeed, the 'father' of the movement - he had made a major contribution in helping to stir the Indian masses. He died on 18 September 1930, leaving the struggle to others.

One  of  the  most  devoted  and  militant  Indian  nationalists  to  visit England was Shapurji Saklatvala. He was also a tireless worker in the cause of workers everywhere, immersing himself in both trade union and political

struggles, particularly in Britain and India. On both counts, Saklatvala was more  radical  than  either  Baptista  or  Gandhi.  Indeed,  his  work  in  Britain both  as  a  Communist  Member  of  Parliament  and  at  grass-roots  level  far exceeded that of Joseph Baptista or any other Asian, at least before him.

## Shapurji Saklatvala: from capitalism to communism

Saklatvala played a glorious role as one of the pioneers of the international working  class  movement.  If,  as  Lenin  said,  'Capital  is  an  international force.  Its  defeat  requires  an  international  brotherhood', 27 then  Saklatvala symbolised  such  an  international  brotherhood  of  workers.  R.  Palme  Dutt recognised  him  as  a  heroic  figure who  fought  on  many  fronts:  for international communism, for Indian national liberation and for the causes of the British working class movement. 28 Indeed, he became the first Indian to be accepted and loved by British workers.

His  development  from  capitalism  to  Communism  reflects  a  spiritual odyssey.  From  a  wealthy  family  background,  he  was  able  to  make  a passionate  commitment  towards  finding  a  means  to  end  the  poverty  and misery of the masses in India. As he told Palme Dutt, there were four stages in  this  spiritual  odyssey.  First  he  sought  in  religion  the  key  that  would unlock the door to a new awakening and advance of the nation. He realised, however, that instead of providing a solution, religion led only to passivity and a sanctifying of the existing unacceptable order of society. Second, he turned to science as a means of helping the Indian people. After years of scientific studies (and having been an active welfare worker in the plague hospitals  and  slums  of  Bombay)  he  found  that  science  alone  offered  no solution unless it was applied in practice to the economy. Third, he felt that in order to end Indian poverty, industrial development was necessary. This led to the establishment of the Tata iron and steel industry in India. Soon, however, his open advocacy of Indian national liberation ran afoul of the authorities. Consequently,  the  Tata  firm  sent  him  to  Britain  as  their departmental  manager.  Finally,  to  climax  his  spiritual pilgrimage,  he entered the world of the National Liberal Club, but quickly found among its members  a  narrow  outlook  and  snobbish  hypocrisy.  After  confrontation with Morley, then Secretary of State for India, he gravitated towards British working class politics.

Saklatvala was born on 28 March 1874 in Bombay. Since the 1830s the Saklatvala  family  was  a  well-known parsee family  in  Bombay.  He  was

intensely sensitive to human suffering. Thus, in spite of being born with 'a silver spoon in his mouth' he moved inevitably towards the working masses and  a  radical  ideology. After  leaving  college,  he  was  devoted  to  industry and was instrumental in setting up the Tata Iron and Steel works under the guidance of his maternal uncle, J. N. Tata. During this time, there was rising national  consciousness  in  India.  The  Indian  National  Congress,  already established  in  1855,  sought  British  goodwill  in  order  to  redress  Indian grievances.  Saklatvala's  interest  in  politics  which  brought  him  in  conflict with  the  British  authorities,  embarrassed  the  Tatas.  To  forestall  growing militant nationalism in Bengal and elsewhere in India, British force became more repressive. After this transitional period in Indian politics, Saklatvala began his political life in England.

He  interestingly  moved  from  being  a  Liberal  (believing  in  British goodwill)  to  an  'arch-enemy'  of  British  imperialism.  Indeed,  he  bravely held on to this uncompromising commitment and attacked imperialism 'in the  heart  of  its  stronghold'. 29 After  a  brief  spell  of  work  in  the  Tata's Manchester  office,  he  came  to  London  where  his  especially  concerned family made him a life-member of the National Liberal Club. This concern was  essentially  that  Saklatvala  would  become  'respectable'  by  meeting 'friends' of Indian freedom. Among those whom he met was Lord Morley of the Morley-Minto  Reforms  of  1909  (which  arrived  'to  rally the moderates' in the face of militant nationalism) that contributed towards the division of Indian nationalism along communal lines through the introduction of separate Hindu and Muslim electorates.

Saklatvala  saw  this  division  and  its  implications  clearly  and  did  not deviate from his argument, which was further strengthened by his familiarity  with  Liberal  bankruptcy  and  hypocrisy  concerning  the  true interests of the Indians. An argument with 'Honest Jack' Morley, resulted in Saklatvala's resignation and his departure from the liberal 'mausoleum'. In 1910  he  entered  British  working  class  politics  through  the  Independent Labour Party. 30

Involvement in the ILP proved an unsatisfactory experience. Saklatvala was disappointed by the Party's gradual shift from being Marxist to antiMarxist.  He  was  in  fact  in  search  of  a  group  of  true  internationalists. Narrow  nationalism  was  redundant;  he  sought  support  for  the  national liberation  movement  in  India.  Thus,  the  ILP  was  found  wanting  in  that

(though  championing  the  cause  of  British  workers)  it  did  not  attack  the cause of capitalist exploitation and failed to link the British working class with  the  international  working-class  movement.  To  Saklatvala,  India's oppression  was  clearly  linked  to  British  capitalists  and  their  exploitation through British imperialism. This belief received a filip in 1917 when the Russian Revolution stirred his imagination and pointed to the possibilities. According  to  one  biographer,  he  saw  this  as  the  precursor  to  'a  new civilisation - a new social order' which would, in the end, bring liberation to the exploited millions living under the heels of capitalism and imperialism. Alerted to the dangers of the Russian Revolution and its effect on  working  class  and  colonial  national  liberation  movements,  predictably the British imperialists used every means to discredit it. But in the wave of anti-Soviet propaganda, Saklatvala and others tried to present the other side of the story before the British public. He consolidated his position in 1918 by  joining  the  People's  Russian  Information  Bureau,  which  spread  the message of the Russian Revolution.

At  the  war's  end,  the  Russian  Revolution  had  the  beneficial  effect  of engendering  hope  in  British  and  colonial  liberation  movements.  Indeed, colonial working-class  movements  became  more  assertive,  leading  to widespread  disturbances  in  1919.  These  colonial  developments  were  not lost  on  Lenin  who  formed  the  Third  International  in  1919.  Saklatvala's response was that the ILP should be affiliated to the Third International to work towards the unity of the workers of the world. This proposal was not accepted by the ILP. Frustrated, Saklatvala moved irrevocably towards the ideals  of  the  Communist  Party,  which  he  joined  in  1921.  To  his  lasting credit, he remained a Party member to his death. 31

Three years after the Russian Revolution, the Communist Party of Great Britain  was  founded  at  a  time  of  growing  militant  activities  in  the  trade union  movement.  The  central  political  struggle  during  this  new  era  of militant working class struggle in Britain was support for the new Russian Republic. Thus, the Hands Off Russia Committee established in Britain in the  spring  of  1919  inaugurated  a  campaign  against  British  intervention. Moreover, in April 1919, the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party at  a  joint  conference  called  for  the  withdrawal  of  British  troops  from Russia.  Further,  the  British  government's  ultimatum  to  the  Soviet  Union resulted  in  radical  elements  in  the  British  working  class  threatening  a general strike. 32

Both the Amritsar  Massacre  and  suppression  of  the  Egyptian  national liberation  movement  drew  protest  from  the  young  Communist  Party  and from the Labour Left. In the CP Saklatvala found what he was looking for: an  organisation  which  took  a  strong  stand  on  international  solidarity  on national liberation and for ending exploitation.

According to one observer, it is no exaggeration to claim that Saklatvala was a product of the British working-class movement. Indeed, his devotion to  this  movement was undoubted. Historically, this international aspect of working-class  unity  was  a  continuing  theme  of  the  British  working  class movement.  In  the  struggle  for  the  reform  of  Parliament,  the  London Workingmen's Association  was  formed  'to  secure  political  rights  for  the workers after  the  failure  to  win  working-class  representation  in  1832'.  In fact, it was this organisation which in 1838 produced the People's Charter, 33 which  in  turn  became  the  rallying  point  for  a  revolutionary  movement which, at the outset, recognised the working-class struggle as an international one.

Soon after Saklatvala came to England, he took an interest in the trade union movement. After joining the CP he became a keen and active trade union  member. This  involvement  was  noted  by  the Daily  Worker: 'Night after night, year after year, in all parts of Britain he carried out his task of working class agitation, education and organisation. No comrade ever did more of his work so uncomplainingly as comrade Saklatvala … No call was ever made upon [him] to which he did not respond.' 34 In spite of bad health, a  'dicky'  heart,  he  displayed  unusual  vitality.  This  unselfish  commitment was observed by both organisers and workers. He cared about reaching the workers, travelling widely on speaking tours and sleeping rough 'even on the floor of the corridor in a crowded train - certainly never in a first class sleeper'. 35 Soon  this  dedication  brought  him  deserved  recognition  from British  workers.  This  was  evident  when  Saklatvala  was  able  to  draw  a crowd of 1500 people, while one of the Blackshirt 'stars' spoke to a 'small audience'. In fact, as soon as Saklatvala began speaking, the small crowd deserted the Fascist and turned to listen to the Communist.

Saklatvala's  involvement  in  the  trade  union  movement  had  deepened over the years, forming the essential base of his politics. Indeed, he was not only an active member of the General Workers' Union, he also joined the Clerks' Union and the Co-operative Union. Moreover, he was elected as a

delegate by the Trades Union Congress of India to represent them at various trade  union  congresses  in  England.  His  popularity  among  rank  and  file workers had grown enormously.

In  the  General  Election  of  October  1922  he  contested  the  seat  of Battersea  North.  His  candidature  aroused  much  debate  and  discussion. Eventually,  however,  he  received  the  support  of  the  Battersea  Trades  and Labour  Council,  and  the  endorsement  of  the  Labour  Party  NEC.  It  was agreed that Saklatvala should run as a Labour candidate. Indeed, he pledged himself publicly to support the Labour Party's Constitution and policy. In his election address, he wrote:

In spite of desperate and ludicrous efforts on the part of Liberals and Tories  alike  to  split  the  Working  Class  Movement  into  hostile fragments, THE LABOUR PARTY IS TODAY THE ONLY PARTY IN GREAT BRITAIN THAT STANDS SOLIDLY TOGETHER. The scare-cry  of  'Communist'  which  is  sure  to  be  raised  by  eleventhhour  leaflets  will  fortunately  not  frighten  the  electors  of  North Battersea … 36

This  statement  is  understandable,  given  the  fact  that  those  were  the years when the CP was trying to obtain affiliation to the Labour Party. 37 In fact,  at  this  time,  Saklatvala's  statements  and  general  attitude  towards  the Labour  Party  were  fundamentally  in  line  with  Communist  Party  policy. During  this  campaign  he  found  in  Mrs  Charlotte  Despard  a  most  active supporter. Saklatvala won the seat by a clear majority of 2000 votes but lost it  in  the  November  1923  Election  by  a  narrow  margin.  In  the  interval between  the  1923  election  and  that  of  1924,  which  brought  the  first minority Labour Government to an end, the Labour Conference of October 1924 banned Communists  from  standing as Labour candidates, and excluded individual Communists from Labour Party membership. Saklatvala,  who  had  attended  this  conference  as  the  St  Pancras  Labour Party delegate was, in effect, forced to contest the Battersea North seat as a Communist  candidate  in  1924.  With  the  over  whelming  support  of  the Battersea North LP, he narrowly defeated his Liberal opponent to win the seat in the Zinoviev Letter election.

During both terms as an MP, Saklatvala worked closely with the leftwing  Scottish  ILP  members.  With  his  broad  outlook,  he  emphasised  the

connection between the workers' struggle in different parts of the Empire. Naturally,  he  was  concerned  with  the  problems  of  colonial  workers  and peasants,  particularly  those  in  India.  There  were  two  organisations  in Britain which provided connections between the British Labour movement and  India.  There  was,  of  course,  Annie  Besant's  Home  Rule  League. Towards the close of the First World War, the League had aroused support for  its  aims  among  ILP  branches  and  trades  councils  in Yorkshire,  South Wales and in some of the larger industrial towns.

Although  Saklatvala  was  a  member  of  the  Home  Rule  League,  he sought  to  fill  another  need  by  forming  the  Workers'  Welfare  League  in 1916.  Its  original  aim,  to  work  with  Indian  seamen  in  London,  was broadened to include matters affecting the working conditions of all groups of  Indian  workers.  Moreover,  when  the All-India  Trades  Union  Congress (AITUC) was established in 1921, the Workers' Welfare League became its agent in Britain. Apart from  Saklatvala, among  the  WWL's  leading members  during  its  early  years,  were  Arthur  Pugh  (until  about  1924)  J. Potter-Wilson and George Lansbury. Predictably, given Saklatvala's political  perspective,  by  the  mid-1920s  the  WWL  was  identified  with  the Communists and the Left generally. After the political rupture of the 1926 General Strike, the League's shift to the left was viewed with considerable hostility by both the Labour Party leadership and the TUC General Council. If Saklatvala's  activities  in  Britain  were  monitored,  thereafter,  he  was closely watched.

Apart from being a black Communist MP in Britain, his political career had  always  been  controversial.  However,  he  remained  undeterred  in  his passion to end oppression. During this turbulent period, he played a full part in  the  many  industrial  and  political  disputes.  As  an  outsider,  he  was  the perfect  scapegoat.  In  October  1921,  his  home  was  searched;  in  1925, although  appointed  a  member  of  the  British  delegation  to  the  Interparliamentary  Union  Congress  in  Washington,  the American  Secretary  of State revoked his visa; 38 and on the first day of the General Strike (4 May 1926) he was arrested and charged with sedition for a speech he made on May Day urging the Army not to fire on the people. 39 Forty years later, a Sunday Times writer  described  Saklatvala  as  one  of  the  instigators  of  the General  Strike.  In  the  face  of  this  onslaught,  he  remained  unbowed.  He refused to be bound over and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment, which was served in Wormwood Scrubs. Moreover, during the period of his

arrest and trial, his home (and those of other well-known Communists) was again raided, 40 These experiences seemed to have strengthened Saklatvala's resolve. After his release he continued to be active by addressing meetings on behalf of the locked-out miners. His imprisonment in Britain served only to heighten the struggle of workers elsewhere in the Empire.

Since he settled in England, he had been back to India three times: in 1912-13  (a  family  visit),  in  1913-14  by  himself;  and  finally  (after  some difficulty in getting permission to enter the country) he arrived in Bombay on 14 January 1927. On his third visit, he received a hero's welcome from most  sections of the Indian nationalists. Like Gandhi,  he  supported organised labour in South Africa and directed attention to the need for trade union and peasant organisations. Moreover, he attended the AITUC Conference as a fraternal delegate, was officially welcomed by several large municipal corporations, and addressed huge audiences. Whilst the official authorities tried to divide the people, he appealed for communal unity in the essential struggle for an independent India. In this, he urged the left to work within  the  Congress  Party.  His  experience  and  involvement  with  British working-class politics made his appeal to the Indian people more passionate and  memorable.  He  was  fully  aware  of  Gandhi's  presence  and  influence. Before he left India, he published an Open Letter to Gandhi whose policies he severely criticised. In the correspondence between them, Gandhi's reply was published on 17 March 1927 in the Bombay Daily Mail .  More letters passed between them, all of which were published in 1970. During this last visit, Saklatvala spent three months in India.

When  he  returned  to  Britain,  India  became  a  no-go  area  -  it  was excluded  from  the  list  of  countries  for  which  his  passport  was  valid.  He became  so  dangerous  that  he  was  refused  entry  to  Egypt  on  his  way  to India. As he found out, his real enemies, ironically, were Labour members such as Wedgwood  Benn,  Secretary of State for India and  Arthur Henderson, Foreign Secretary, who upheld the ban on his entry into India when the Labour Party was returned to office in 1929. He was also refused admission  into  Belgium  in  1929,  while  on  his  way  to  attend  a  League Against  Imperialism  meeting.  The  League  had  an  important  bearing  on Saklatvala's  politics.  Earlier  in  February  1926,  the  League  was  founded after  meetings  in  Berlin  and  Brussels. Thereafter  the  organisation  became the League Against Imperialism, with George Lansbury as Chairman. After his resignation,  two  months  later,  James  Maxton  replaced  him.  Willi

Munzenberg became one of the two international secretaries, and Jawaharlal Nehru, Saklatvala and Diego Riviera of Mexico were members of  the  Executive  Committee.  Reginald  Bridgeman,  the  former  British Foreign Office diplomat, was secretary of the British section. Clearly, the LAI was not popular with the world's press or the Indian government which banned all its literature. More witch-hunting was to come. In January 1929, Saklatvala, Maxton, Bridgeman, A.J. Cook and Alex Gossip, on their way to  attend  a  meeting  of  the  League  in  Cologne,  arrived  in  Ostend  where Cook and Gossip were allowed to continue their journey, while the other three were arrested and sent back to Britain. Saklatvala, with no illusions, was right about the international conspiracy of capital.

Unfortunately at this  time,  the  political  divisions  on  the  left  had  hit  a new low. Before the Communist International had taken a hard line against reformism  Saklatvala  had  already  been  critical  of  the  Labour  Party.  He argued that since the Party had turned itself into a liberal reformist group, the  CP,  given  that  it  was  the  only  anti-capitalist  party,  should  seek  trade union affiliations. 41 Moreover, at the Sixth World Congress of the Communist International in the summer of 1928, Saklatvala, with R. Palme Dutt  and  Harry  Pollitt,  demanded  a  radical  change  in  policy.  This  was achieved at the eleventh Congress held between November and December 1929 at Leeds. Earlier, in the General Election of 1929, Saklatvala lost his seat  to the  Labour  candidate,  who  polled  twice  as  many  votes.  The following  year,  Saklatvala  stood  again  in  a  by-election  in  Shuttleston, Glasgow, but lost. In 1931, he again contested a Battersea seat, but failed miserably, polling only half the number of votes he had received in 1929. It was a sound victory for the Conservative candidate, and a reflection that the political tide had turned their way.

During the remaining years of his  life,  Saklatvala  kept  up  a  gruelling schedule,  speaking  at  meetings  across  the  country. Among  others  he  was particularly  concerned  with  unemployment,  the  central  issue  at  the  time. Together  with  Reg  Bishop,  his  friend  and  secretary,  he  visited  the  Soviet Union  for  the  third  time.  He  was  impressed  by  the  changes  he  had  seen among the non-Russian peoples in central Asia. A year later, he was again active in electioneering. This time, he campaigned for Harry Pollitt in the Rhondda,  and  Willie  Gallacher  in  West  Fife.  Indeed,  he  continued  to address meetings until two weeks before his death from a heart attack on 16 June 1936.

## The radicalisation of Pan Africanism

George Padmore: from communism to Pan Africanism

Perhaps the most vital advocate of radical Pan Africanism was the globetrotting, black revolutionary George Padmore, who after the first triumph of Pan Africanism, Ghanaian Independence, has remained relatively forgotten. His  wide  travels,  however,  led  eventually  to  the  crucial  years  of  feverish activity and historic organisation in Britain between 1935 and 1957.

George  Padmore  was  the  adopted  name  of  Malcolm  Ivan  Meredith Nurse,  who  was  born  in  the  Arouca  district  of  Tacarigua  in  Trinidad,  in 1902.

One of Malcolm's closest friends at school in Port of Spain was C. L. R. James. His undistinguished school career in Trinidad led to his employment shortly after graduation with the Trinidad Publishing Company as a reporter of  shipping news for the Weekly Guardian .  His  working relationship with the editor, Edward Partridge, an Englishman with an authoritarian approach to  his  staff,  set  the  tone  for  Malcolm  Nurse's  passionate  involvement  in anti-imperialist journalism and politics.

His  desire  to  achieve  higher  education,  such  as  that  gained  by  a  few locals for example the barrister Henry Sylvester Williams (who called the first  Pan  African  Conference)  led  to  travel  abroad.  In  September  1924, given  the  immigration  quota  system,  Nurse  went  to  Fisk  University, Tennessee, with the intention of studying medicine.

When he arrived at Fisk, he changed his mind about studying medicine. Instead, he decided to study law for which he prepared by reading political science.  Journalism  held  a  special  attraction.  He  not  only  joined  the Fisk Herald , the student newspaper, but played a leading part as an exceptionally able speaker who was sought after to speak on colonial questions. Already in 1926 his grasp of international issues was becoming pronounced. He was one of the 75 state-wide delegates attending a conference on 'religion and the  world'  organised  by  the  Student  V olunteer  Movement.  He  shared  the platform with Dr Mordecai Johnson, President of Howard University. The following  year,  he  attended  another  conference.  By  then  he  had  become well-known  and  regarded  by  a  conference  organiser  as  'one  of  the outstanding students in Nashville today'.

From here he established contact with the Nigerian Benjamin Azikiwe who was at Howard University. The idea was to form an African student

organisation to encourage racial consciousness and a spirit of nationalism aimed at protecting the sovereignty of Liberia. The 1920s was a particularly troubled decade at Fisk: student activities were restricted and the Ku Klux Klan looked for scapegoats among  agitators, communists  and 'new negroes'.  In  fact,  there  was  also  a  student  strike.  Whatever  effects  these factors might have had, Malcolm Nurse did not take his degree. However, with a 'first rate record' he arrived in New York where he entered one of the City's  universities.  In  1926,  his  wife  had  joined  him  in  New  York  from Trinidad  and  in  1927,  he  asked Azikiwe  for  help  to  establish  an African student organisation 'to foster racial consciousness and a spirit of nationalism aiming at the protection of the sovereignty of Liberia'. In time, he would become preoccupied with Liberia and the rest of Africa.

His absence at classes and examinations at the Law School of New York University led to his being 'dropped'. He had, however, enrolled at the Law School of  Howard University 'presumably because the Communist Party, which  he  joined  shortly  after  reaching  the  Greenwich  Village  campus, wanted him to do so'.

This  involvement  with  the  Communist  Party  would  have  far-reaching consequences.  At  the  time  a  large  number  of  students  from  the  British colonies  were  concentrated  at  Howard  University.  Of  the  200  foreign students,  150  were  from  British  territories.  Nurse,  under  party  discipline from  mid-1927,  had  by  1928  adopted  the  name  George  Padmore  (a compound of his school friend's surname and his father-in-law's christian name,  George)  while  engaged  in  party  business.  He  wrote:  'You  see,  all revolutionaries  are  compelled  to  adopt  false  names  to  hide  their  identity from the Government.' 42

This double life was quite successful in concealing Nurse's real identity. One of his instructors at Howard University who knew him well, Dr Ralph Bunche, was not aware of his Communist  connection. During this Nurse/Padmore  phase,  Padmore  as  secretary  of  the  International  AntiImperialistic Youth League criticised Sir Esme Howard (who was on a visit to  the  campus)  as  a  representative  of  'history's  most  bloated  Empire'  and for his alleged part in Marcus Garvey's deportation from the United States. At  the  time,  there  was  a  campus  Garvey  Club.  Padmore's  behaviour  was outrageous.  The  institution's  President  Johnson,  who  apologised  for  this embarrassing incident, explained that it was the act of an outsider (one of the  'new  negroes!')  since  an  examination  of  the  record  showed  that  no

George  Padmore  was  registered  at  Howard.  Thus,  the  well-known  young man at Fisk became hugely popular at Howard. His penchant for opposition was  remarkable.  Bunche  recalled  a  speech  Nurse  made  in  the  campus  in which he denounced just about everybody and everything connected with the University in fluent ringing rhetoric. Indeed, he won the admiration of both  the  faculty  and  student  body  achieving  the  honour  of  being  'our favourite speaker'. Thus, in a short space of time, he had achieved unusual prominence both as a student and a youth leader. While American racism troubled him, he was encouraged by the 'new Negro' reaction, the kind of spirit  which he hoped to see more of in Trinidad. Towards the end of the 1920s in America, he was poor, but enthusiastic and 'keen on winning his way in the world'. 43

During that  part  of  the  decade  while  he  was  in America,  he  travelled extensively on party business. His journalistic work, by 1928, was important enough to appear in New York's Daily Worker and collaboration with Richard B. Moore led to editorial work of the Party's Harlem paper Negro  Champion .  Of  note  during  this  period  was  Padmore's  concern  for black workers, as seen in his involvement in the Harlem Workers' Centre and the workers' school connected with the Party. The education of workers would continue to  preoccupy  him  between  his  other  activities  throughout his life.

Moreover, in his work he relied on the new left-wing trade unions. He observed the real problems of inter-racial working class unity and felt that the  distance  between  black  and  white  workers  in  the  southern  states  was equal  to that between  Jews  and  Russian  peasants  under  the  Czarist dispensation. Until that point, he had paid little attention to Africa. Within the CP it was assumed that Afro-Americans would provide the leadership because there were few capable Africans. A generation later, the reverse was assumed: a strong Africa was necessary for the freedom of Afro-Americans. About  this  time,  Nurse,  the  selfless  worker,  had  fully  adopted  the  name George Padmore.

In March 1928, delegates at the Fourth Congress of the Profintern (or Red International of Labour Unions, RILU, the first genuine participation by Africans), called for more activity in Africa and instructed the Executive Bureau to bring together representatives of the Negro workers to work out 'immediate practical measures for carrying into effect the policy laid down in regard to the question of organising Negro workers in the United States

and  in  Africa'. 44 There  was  nothing  new  in  this,  only  a  reiteration  of  a resolution  passed  at  RILU's  Second  Congress  in  1923. 45 At  this  stage, however,  action  was  taken  initially  by  Willi  Munzenberg,  a  German Comintern member which resulted in a conference held in Brussels 10-15 February  1927  to  co-ordinate  anti-colonial  measures  and  to  reconcile  the differences  between  the  antipathetic Amsterdam  (or  Second)  and  Red  (or Moscow)  international  labour  union  bodies. 46 This  successful  conference was attended by 34 delegates from five continents.

As  a  direct  result,  the  League  Against  Imperialism  and  for  National Independence was formed, with Fenner Brockway as General Secretary. 47 Although Brockway resigned, the League remained an important Communist International (Comintern) body until the line changed in 1935.

By  the  time  of  the  Sixth  Congress  of  the  Comintern  (15  July-15 September 1928) with Stalin in control of both the Party and the state, the fundamental  'Negro  Question'  was  raised.  Padmore  thought  that  Stalin's spokesman,  Kuusinen's  (who  had  never  seen  more  than  a  dozen  black people before the Congress) proposal of a 'black republic' was a 'fantastic scheme' intended to secure sections of the Garvey organisation; a peculiar form of 'Negro Zionism which … toys with the aristocratic attributes of a non-existent 'Negro Kingdom''. Hitherto, Padmore's speeches reflected a belief in the Party's aid to the black man in America, not to set him apart from  it.  From  here  on,  he  became  increasingly  preoccupied  with  Africa. Liberia, in particular, was to him a beacon in the dark continent.

According to Hooker, Padmore  did not participate in the Sixth Congress.  He  was,  however,  in  attendance  with  James  W.  Ford  at  the Second Congress of the League Against Imperialism held in Frankfurt 2031 July.  Padmore was elected a member of the organisational committee, and assigned to get together the names  of all West Indian labour organisations. He also wrote articles for the revolutionary press in America and Europe. 48

The Frankfurt Congress was significant, marking Padmore's entry into international  communist  activity  and  brought  to  an  end  his  activities  in America. Indeed, his final contribution to the Party's efforts in the Negro labour struggle was as a delegate to the Trade Union Unity League (TUUL) convention in Cleveland, where he spoke out against white chauvinism and black Uncle Tomism.

Padmore had become an important Party member and had reached the threshold  of  a  great  career  when  he  went  to  Moscow  to  report  on  the Cleveland convention. He  impressed Party officials and became  an important official of Profintern. During 1930, he lectured on colonialism at Kutvu, the University of the Toilers of the East. Although there is doubt as to  whether  he  collaborated  with  Stalin,  it  is  clear  that  he  did  move  in important  circles,  first  as  an  American  specialist,  and  then  as  head  of RILU's Negro Bureau. He also wrote articles on Negro and African affairs to the English language Moscow Daily News .

Moreover, Padmore sat on the Commission which investigated the ultraleft deviationist charges levelled against Li Li-san and Mao Tse-tung. Li-Lisanism was the doctrine which called for the Chinese revolution to be led by the urban proletariat because the rural masses were inert. Interestingly, Padmore agreed with the Commission that the accused was 'fundamentally a  young  romantic  adventurer'. 49 Clearly  Padmore  had  become  'a  top person, one who pulled strings and did not move among lesser fry'.

Padmore was instrumental in planning the First International Conference  of  Negro  Workers  in  Hamburg,  7-9  July  1930.  The  meeting was originally recommended to be held in London, 'the centre of imperial power', but was refused permission by the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald.  While  this  stand  by  the  government  was  understandable  in view  of  the  Labour  Party's  reformism  and  their  paternalistic  views  of colonial  trade  unions,  it  was  hypocritical  that  MacDonald  should  issue  a Circular Despatch urging colonial governments to set up Labour Departments. 50 Of  course,  such  departments  were  designed  to  forestall labour unrest which nonetheless exploded thereafter, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s.

In spite of the restrictions in granting colonials passports, 17 delegates managed  to  attend,  including  a  white  representative  of  black  workers  in South Africa  and  workers  from Trinidad,  Jamaica,  Nigeria,  Sierra  Leone, Gold Coast, the Gambia and the Cameroons. This strong African representation  was  in  contrast  to  the  non-representation  of  the  French, Portuguese  and  Belgian  territories  in Africa  and  the  British  East African territories.

Given  Padmore's  broad  sweep  view  of  the  international  struggle,  he stressed the connection with revolutionary movements of coloured peoples

in  Asia,  and  interestingly,  warned  against  'Garveyism,  Pan  Africanism, national reformism and trade union reformism'. The conference ended with the appointment of a new international commission.

Padmore's  central  role  in  these  revolutionary  developments  had  not gone unnoticed. Fenner Brockway, who was impressed with Padmore when they met later, identified the value of this work as 'encouraging the demand for political independence and stimulating among the native conscripts the idea that when a suitable opportunity came they should fight for their own national freedom'. 51

Moreover,  this  conference  had  an  effect  on  RILU  which  passed  a 'special  Resolution  on  work  among  Negroes  in  the  United  States  and  the colonies', when the Congress met in March 1931. Earlier, RILU had set up a  new  arm,  the  International  Trade  Union  Committee  of  Negro  Workers which  began  the  monthly  publication  of  the Negro  Worker (the  first  two issues  titled  the International  Negro  Workers'  Review) .  It  was  printed  in secrecy in the waterfront district of Hamburg and distributed primarily by black  sailors.  Following  dissolution  of  the  German  CP,  the  missionary society took charge of the house and copies of Negro Worker were, fittingly, bound into religious tracts to escape police notice.

In 1931 the Liberian-American and Liberian-League of Nations dispute led to the editor and secretary of the ITUC-NW denouncing imperialism; he saw the Firestone concession as a new phase of imperialist rivalry. Padmore took  the  opportunity  to  point  out  that  the Americo-Liberians  showed  the weakness of Garvey's view that a black bourgeoisie should be trained. He wrote: 'I have always considered it my special duty to expose and denounce the misrule of the black governing classes in Haiti, Liberia and Abyssinia, while  at  the  same  time  defending  these  semi-colonial  countries  against imperialist aggression.' 52

As  a  principal  spokesman,  it  was  becoming  difficult  for  Padmore  to avoid racial references. He maintained, however, in relation to the ITUCNW that the purpose of the Committee was to build up Negro unions along class rather than race lines. He wrote prolifically and effectively during his first  year  on  the  Committee.  His  output  included  six  of  the  Committee's twenty-five  pamphlets,*  and  many  essays  and  articles.  In  his  writings, Padmore ridiculed Garvey, criticised the 'petit bourgeois Negro intellectual'

DuBois for his anti-communism and attacked Blaise Diagne for supporting French imperialism.

In 1932 Padmore arrived in London and came into contact with C. A. Smith, Chairman of the Independent Labour Party and the Common Wealth Party and editor of Controversy .

A year later, while in Germany, with Hitler in power and the German Communist Party on the defensive, Padmore was jailed and deported. On arrival in England he was met by Special Branch officers who were wary of his presence in Britain.

By mid-1934, Padmore's expulsion notice was served by the Comintern Control  Commission. And by the mid-1930s, anti-colonial  activity  within the Comintern was reduced as the Russians tried to gain greater acceptance in  the West. Earlier, in August 1933, Comintern disbanded the ITUC-NW which was welcome news among Western imperialist powers. This act had a major influence on Padmore who immediately resigned the positions he held.  Thereafter  there  have  been  many  versions  of  his  defection.  But, perhaps  he  should  be  allowed  to  speak  for  himself  as  one  who  had  been holding

a  responsible  position  in  the  higher  councils  of  the  communist international,  which  was  called  upon  not  only  to  endorse  the  new diplomatic policy of the Soviet Government, but to put a break upon the anti-imperialist work  of its affiliate sections and thereby sacrifice  the  young  national  liberation  movements  in  Asia  and Africa.  This  I  considered  to  be  a  betrayal  of  the  fundamental interests  of  my  people,  with  which  I  could  not  identify  myself.  I therefore  had  no  choice  but  to  sever  my  connection  with  the Communist International. I formulated my position quite clearly in a political  statement  which  I  submitted  to  the  Comintern  Executive, and which was subsequently published by the Negro Press, so that my case would be put before my own people. With that the matter was closed as far as I was concerned, and I have never permitted my political objectivity in regard to the Soviet Union to be influenced by my experiences with the Comintern. These are the circumstances in which I resigned from the Communist International, and it is only necessary to add that, in keeping with communist practice, a formal statement of my expulsion followed. But this did not disturb me in

the least, for no one whose disassociation from the communist ranks might give rise to any political embarrassment is allowed to make his exit without vilification. Sometimes you are a 'Trotskyist', other times a 'left-wing deviationist', or a 'right-wing deviationist', depending upon the particular period; but I got away with it lightly, as my sin was merely 'petit bourgeois nationalist deviation'. 53

Thus, Padmore, the 'Top Negro', had descended from the dizzy heights of the CP but he continued to argue for 'Negro Unity' on race rather than on class lines, and attempted an association with DuBois, whom he had earlier attacked. 54 Since  his  expulsion  from  the  Party,  he  remained  silent  under attack  and  refused  (except  occasionally)  to  defend  himself.  Indeed,  he maintained  his  belief  that  only  the  Russians  through  Communism  had succeeded in decolonising and in eliminating racial prejudice. 55

## Black brotherhood in London

In  London  Padmore  became  involved  with  the  West  African  Students' Union. He wrote to DuBois (perhaps the first time he did so) asking for help 'to  create  a  basis  for  unity  among  Negroes  in Africa, America,  the  West Indies and other lands'. 56 Padmore was optimistic about Negro seriousness and cynical about the motives of middle-class Negro Americans, sentiments which were reinforced when Dr Willis Huggins came to London from New York, later in 1935, to raise funds for Ethiopia. Huggins was put in touch with WASU, which, in turn, directed him to C. L. R. James's International African Friends of Ethiopia, which procured the necessary credentials from the Ethiopian Minister in London. Huggins was not heard of again.

DuBois was already keen about the idea of a militant youth movement for  the  world  liberation  of  'coloured  peoples'.  In  fact,  he  had  outlined similar  ideas  at  a  conference  in  New  York  sometime  in  1933  which  was resisted  by  the  older  NAACP  leaders;  a  resistance  which  led  to  DuBois breaking away from that organisation and to a closer involvement with the wider perspective of the 'new-style' Pan Africanists such as Padmore. Thus, by 1934, co-operation between Padmore and DuBois seemed likely. 57

Moreover,  the  LCP  had  called  a  conference  (on  14-15  July)  at  the Albert Hall to consider 'The Negro in the World Today'. The 43 'reformers' headed  by  Moody,  aroused  contempt  from  the  militants.  Occasionally,

however, Padmore and Moody had co-operated, for example in 1938 when the Bledisloe Commission considered the possibility of 'closer association' of the Rhodesias. In general, however, (and this clearly separated both men) Moody preferred to be associated with more respectable groups.

Further interest in the 'Negro  Question'  was  engendered  by  the worsening  of  race  relations  between  Italy  and  Ethiopia  which  resulted  in Italian  aggression  in  1935.  That  year  Padmore  came  to  reside  in  Britain permanently. He contacted James (who led the IAFE, a defence committee in  support  of  Ethiopia)  whom he had not seen for three years. About this time,  Padmore  lived  first  at  the  Vauxhall  Bridge  Road,  then  moved  to Guildford  Street  near  Russell  Square.  He  met  Ras  Makonnen  and  Eric Williams (then a student and later Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago) who 'followed Padmore and James closely but never joined their organisations,  preferring  instead  to  prepare  for  an  Oxford  first'. 58 T.  B. Subasinghe  (later  to  become  the Ambassador  of  Ceylon  in  Russia),  who was  also  close  to  Padmore  during  1935-45,  recalled  that  Padmore  'went through  very  difficult  times  in  that  period.  He  conducted  political  study classes for some colonial students, including myself. Those participating in the study classes made small contributions to pay him for his lectures. But these  were  very  small  sums  of  money'. 59 Padmore  then  met  Fenner Brockway,  F. A.  Ridley  of  the  ILP,  and  Reginald  Reynolds  and  his  wife Ethel Mannin. 60

Padmore, the ex-Comintern member, was not free of the surveillance of British Intelligence agents. A secret circular sent out to the colonies, advised that  'George  Padmore  former  secretary  of  the  International  Trade  Union Committee  of  Negro  Workers  has  now  formed,  in  conjunction  with Tiemeko Garan Kouyate, a prominent French Negro Communist, his own organisation  for  revolutionary  work  in  Africa,  entitled  the  'Pan  African Brotherhood' and already had issued a manifesto on the Ethiopian crisis.' This statement was inaccurate. There was no such organisation in existence, Kouyate was no longer a communist and Padmore was no longer in close contact with him after leaving Paris for London. Nevertheless the Nyasaland  government,  which  had  been  alerted  through  the  editor  of  the Nyasaland Times ,  banned  the Association's  publications. Thus, Padmore's notoriety  had  extended  to  the  colonies.  This  did  not  worry  or  deter  this black  revolutionary  who  had  become,  if  anything,  increasingly  concerned

with the crisis in Ethiopia. His commitment to Africa intensified. This was evident  in  the  fact  that  after  the  ITUC-NW,  though  close  to  the  ILP,  he never joined a non-African organisation. Although close to his friend James, he did not become a Trotskyite and the contempt with which he held the British  CP  was  'boundless'. 61 This  detachment  from  white  organisations marked Padmore's clear preoccupation with essentially African affairs.

Nevertheless,  the  concerns  of  Africa  necessitated  maximum  publicity which  he  found  through  contact  with  white-controlled  organisations  and journals in Britain. Through F. A. Ridley he developed a close relationship with the ILP and frequently wrote for its journal the New Leader which was edited by Brockway. He never joined the ILP, and repeated efforts by the ILP to secure his candidature for Parliamentary election were unsuccessful. 62

His enthusiasm and commitment had not wavered since his early years in the United States; Padmore argued that when Europeans expressed horror at  General  Franco's  use  of  Moorish  troops  they  were  not  only  being inconsistent since substantial numbers of Blacks had been welcomed by the Allies during the World War, but also implicitly racist. Why should they be chilled at the thought of black troops? And did they not see that the black soldiers themselves were a function of imperialism, an aspect of exploited humanity? 63

The publication of his book How Britain Rules Africa in 1936 received generally favourable reviews. He was much respected by other colonials in Britain. That year Padmore  met  K.  D. Kumria, founder of Swaraj (Freedom) House in Percy Street, at an Indian Congress rally. Despite his hostility  towards  the  Congress  during  his  Profintern  phase  of  activity  (he always felt they were moving in the wrong direction), he had 'a high regard for  people  like  Jawaharlal  Nehru  and  Subash  Chandrabose.  But  as  a Marxist,  he  also  pointed  out  the  limitations  of  these  leaders  and  of  the Indian Nationalist Movement which was under the dominant influence of the Indian bourgeoisie'. 64 Padmore had also developed a warm friendship with Krishna Menon. These ties in later years, especially after 1947, led to Swaraj House becoming a venue for protest meetings of African groups.

In 1937, Padmore's third book, Africa and World Peace , was published and the pamphlet The West Indies Today was produced in association with Arthur Lewis, then a young student at the London School of Economics.

That year, Padmore met Dorothy Pizer (an English woman), his 'wife' with whom he lived before they moved to Cranleigh Street, London NW1 and then to Ghana in 1957. Padmore's residence became the 'headquarters' of anti-colonial  agitation  for  many  Africans  during  the  1940s  and  the  early 1950s.  Significantly  also  in  1937,  Padmore  had  founded  the  International African Service Bureau (an essentially West Indian organisation); a reconstitution of what was left of James's IAFE defence committee. There was a tendency among Padmore's close friends to minimise the importance and potential of the IASB  whose  motto was 'Educate, co-operate, emancipate. Neutral in nothing affecting the African people.' Was the IASB too ambitious? One observer wrote that the organisation, formed in March 1937, 'has possibilities for doing constructive work if it limits its field of endeavour,  which  at  present  seems  too  wide  for  effective  work'. 65 In October James went to New York on a speaking engagement and remained in the United States during the war.

Of  the  seven-member  Executive  of  the  IASB,  only  I.  T. A.  WallaceJohnson  and  Jomo  Kenyatta  were  African.  These  men  felt  this  'ginger group' could stimulate publicity to highlight colonial grievances. Fortunately, they had allies such as Brockway who from 1938 placed IASB notices  and  Padmore's  essays  in  the New  Leader .  In  this  respect,  C.  A. Smith helped with Controversy . The Bureau was well favoured by members of the British Left, for example Reginald Sorensen, D. N. Pritt, KC., Sylvia Pankhurst,  Arthur  Creech-Jones  and  Victor  Gollancz.  So  close  was  this association that after leaving their 94 Gray's Inn Road premises, the IASB was allowed to use the offices of the ILP before the outbreak of the war. Indeed, Padmore acted as the 'colonial section' of the party. 66

He was not the only marked man among colonial activists. In a report entitled,  'Wallace-Johnson  and  the  International African  Service  Bureau', British Intelligence thought Wallace-Johnson to be the Bureau's creator. His connection  with  Padmore's  'Pan African  Brotherhood'  further  implicated him.  After  Wallace-Johnson  returned  home,  allegedly  over  a  'money dispute' among executive members, the Bureau was dominated by Padmore until 1944 when it merged with the Pan African Federation.

If  the  threat  of  war  in  Europe  afforded  some  leverage  to  colonial agitators, the IASB was ready to exercise it. In September 1938, the Bureau published  the  manifesto  'Europe's  Difficulty  is Africa's  Opportunity'  and

stressed that this should not be regarded as a racist view, but a realistic one; opposition was  aimed  at  exploitation, rather than the colour of the exploiter's skin. 67

Padmore's services in left-wing circles was in great demand. Raymond Postgate, who was editing the journal Fact at  the  time,  asked  Padmore to write  on  'Negro'  African  Revolt.  Padmore,  fully  occupied  with  IASB's activities,  declined.  Postgate  managed,  however,  to  get  James's  essay  on 'Negro  Slave  Revolts'.  Padmore  was  also  involved  in  the  joint  petition (IASB,  LCP,  NWA)  presented  to  the  Royal  Commission  to  investigate conditions in the West Indies under the chairmanship of Lord Moyne.

When  Padmore  visited  Germany  in  November,  he  reported  on  a mammoth  rally  at  Berlin  University,  observing  a  growing  colonialist sentiment  and  how  such  developments  in  Germany,  tolerantly  viewed  by many, nevertheless raised real fears among colonials. According to Hooker, scholarly opinion pointed to the conclusion that the Chamberlain government  seriously  considered  attempting  to  satisfy  Hitler  with  some African territory. Even if this was exaggerated, he argued, the fundamental point  was  what  in  fact  did  Africans  think.  The  IASB  editorial  secretary, William  Harrison  (a  black  American  student  at  the  LSE),  wrote  that  the growing race prejudice in Britain was disillusioning subject peoples who, increasingly,  were  inclined  to  discount  British  aims.  Further,  the  former editor  of  WASU,  Ohenenana  Cobina  Kessie  of Ashanti,  whose  pamphlet Colonies:  What  Africa  Thinks went  through  two  editions  in  two  weeks, found  white  labour  invariably  racist,  saw  a  European  war  as  being  of  no concern  to Africans  and  strongly  criticised  the  reported  hint  that  Nigeria might  be  transferred  to  the  Germans  to  satisfy  their  African  aspirations. During  the  year,  Padmore  emphasised  labour  matters  in  South  Africa, calling  on  Africans  to  show  greater  race  awareness.  Ever  vigilant,  he condemned  the  likelihood  of  the  three  High  Commission  Protectorates Territories being transferred to South African control. And to forestall such an eventuality the IASB organised a protest meeting in Trafalgar Square. 68

By the turn of 1939, the IASB helped to call a conference at Friends House, Euston, where continental and British Socialists gathered to discuss the popular front and warn colonial peoples of the dangers.

As the war approached, Padmore's movements continued to be closely monitored. By April, the Special Branch discovered more internal troubles

in the IASB. In the absence of Wallace-Johnson, the Bureau's new secretary was Babalola Wilkey, who because of financial difficulties left the IASB to form the Negro Cultural Association which was affiliated to the  National Council  for  Civil  Liberties.  During  the  war,  the  enterprising  Wilkey  had opened a Colonial Peoples Club in Frith Street, Soho. Whatever truth there might have been in these internal troubles, the IASB had moved from Grays Inn  Road to 12A Westbourne Grove, then to the ILP office at St Bride's. Given these hard times, as the police correctly assumed, Padmore virtually ran the ILP Negro affairs. 69

In  June  1939,  Padmore  expounded  his  views  on  military  service,  a touchy  subject,  as  the  war  machine  was  being  set  in  motion.  In  'Why  I oppose  conscription' 70 he  argued  against  support  for  imperialist  war  and against co-operating with capitalism because 'the enemy is at home'. Other concerned black leaders and organisations met at a conference of coloured peoples from 7 to 9 July at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street. Padmore had  to  face  the  Communists  who  attempted  to  control  the  proceedings. Speaking as representative of both the IASB and (Wallace-Johnson's) Sierra Leone Youth League, he objected and during a 'rough session' he impressed one observer as he maintained a dignified bearing 'under fire'. Many who had met Padmore over the years attested to this restraint under attack which was particularly indicative of his attitude to relations with the Communist Party.

In the last days before the war a 'Warning to the Coloured Peoples' was issued,  a final statement  that  Nazis,  fascists  and  democrats  were  all imperialist  bandits  whose  conflict  had  no  heroes  or  villains  as  far  as oppressed colonial people were concerned.

By  the  end  of  1939,  the  'phoney  war'  had  broken  out  and  Padmore wrote in his article 'The British Empire is the Worst Racket yet Invented by Man' that 'if imperialism means a certain racial superiority, suppression of political and economic freedom of other peoples, exploitation of resources of  other  countries  for  the  benefit  of  the  imperialist  countries,  then  I  say those are not characteristic of this country'. Padmore reiterated his request that British workers should cease their tacit support of the Empire. He was, as he had always been, unsparing in his attack on imperialism. He and the ILP were agreed:

We  were  against  Hitler  and  all  he  stood  for  when  he  was  being supported by the City of London and when British merchants were flooding Germany with the war goods and munitions he wanted. We were  always  against  him  and  any  form  of  Totalitarianism  and  the best and only way to beat him and the Nazis was 'to make Britain Socialist now'.

Particularly  galling  was  the  involvement  of  black  colonials  in  the  white imperialist wars.

While Padmore opposed the war, he paradoxically demanded that the colour  bar be removed  from  the  services.  He  refused  to  make  any contribution to the war effort, unlike his friend Jomo Kenyatta who worked as a 'directed labour' farm-hand in Sussex. In October 1943 Padmore told Ernest  Bevin,  Minister  of  Labour,  of  his  refusal  to  undertake  directed employment. Although he was offered a post in the Ministry of Information, he declined. He said he would rather go to prison than 'help in any way the war effort of British Imperialism or any other Imperialism'. 71 Interestingly, Bevin ignored Padmore's stubborn refusal, perhaps because the authorities were determined not to make a martyr of him.

During the early months of the war, Padmore spoke frequently against the capitalist and imperialist war. Moreover, he was alerted to the use of the word  'nigger'  by  a  BBC  broadcaster.  Both  the  IASB  and  the  LCP complained  and  the  Corporation  apologised.  This  issue  led  to  Padmore's brief co-operation with the LCP. He  spoke at their annual general meeting. 72

Events in Africa and the West Indies continued to preoccupy him. He drew a distinction between national independence and freedom in the West Indies and Africa: 'We demand full self-determination not as an end in itself - for we are not narrow nationalists - but as the historic pre-requisite for the free  and  voluntary  co-operation  between  all  nations  and  peoples  and races.' 73

In his repeated protests Padmore received the support of West African students who refused to accept that the Allied war aims did not affect them. Thus WASU organised its second conference on West Africa in the summer of  1942  on  democracy  and  its  application  to  that  area.  The  resolutions demanded self-government now and freedom within five years. Given that

the majority of colonial students in Britain were from the upper and middle classes (the sons and daughters of the native bourgeoisie, professional men, government officials, chiefs and other petty rulers), Padmore regarded that generation of students as a prelude to freedom. However, this evidence of anti-colonial  agitation  encouraged Padmore's hope that after the defeat of fascism,  a  socialist  Africa  might  co-operate  with  a  federated,  socialist Britain and Europe. 74

In 1943, Padmore wrote a number of essays for the New Leader: he saw indirect rule as a fraud, the creation of a Colonial Development and Welfare Fund  as  a  hoax.  Most  of  the  Moyne  Commission  recommendations  had been  shelved  'for  the  duration'  while  the  big  corporations  continued  to exploit the colonial economies and reap huge war-time profits. He predicted a post-war world that would be ready-made for capitalists.

The achievement of Russia in effecting mass education for her people has  had  a  powerful  impact  on  WASU  writers.  Thus,  the  relationship between  Russia  and  colonialism  was  fundamental  to  an  understanding  of Padmore. He was optimistic about the Russian revolutionary achievement which  had  upset  the  social,  economic  and  political  arrangement  between social classes. One of his admirers, Subasinghe, who knew him well wrote:

He often pointed out that a multi-national state like the Soviet Union could  and  would  maintain  its  solidarity  and  hold  out  against  a powerful enemy because of the gains of the people and the manner in which the national question had been solved. This view and his supreme confidence were justified as subsequent events showed. 75

He was aware of the Russian industrial achievement and was impressed by the co-operation between the various races and peoples. He argued strongly that  the  Soviet  Union  had  done  more  to  'liquidate  illiteracy  and  raise  the cultural level of the former subject races of Central Asia within twenty-five years than the British Government has accomplished in India or Africa in two  centuries'.  In  effect,  the  disappearance  of  the  capitalist-imperialist Russian regime meant the disappearance of the oppressor-oppressed relationship between the imperialist metropolis and colonial periphery. 76

In the light of today's problems of multi-racialism, Padmore's views on socialism  and  imperialism  are  worth  noting  at  length:  he  argued  that socialism unites but

Imperialism  divides.  Under  Imperialism,  the  native  races  of  Asia and Africa are being kept as illiterate as possible, for history shows that  as  soon  as  an  educated  minority  emerges  among  such  subject people  it  becomes  the  voice  of  the  national  aspirations  of  the backward  inarticulate  masses.  The  idea  of  national  and  cultural independence  and  political  unity  among  multi-racial  and  national groups  is  possible  only  along  the  lines  of  a  socialised  planned economy. And  that  is  why  we  are  witnessing  today  a  tremendous heroic  stand  of  a  multi-national  state  (which  because  of  its  many, many  different  peoples  cannot  be  called  'Russian')  which  is  the marvel of the whole world. 77

As  an  anti-Stalinist,  Padmore  defended  the  Soviet  Union.  He  insisted that  only  socialists  had  the  right  to  condemn  Stalin.  'We  must  while repudiating Stalin's Finnish adventure, dissociate ourselves from all entanglements  within  the  imperialist  warmongers  and  their  anti-Soviet campaign.' 78 Nevertheless, Padmore regarded Stalin as a 'harsh tyrant', and harboured the fond memory of having spent three years in the Soviet Union and never encountered 'the slightest manifestation of racial chauvinism or colour  bar'.  More  pointedly  one  is  reminded  that  he  sat  on  the  Moscow Soviet,  whereas  he  could  not  have  aspired  to  the  Port  of  Spain  City Council! In spite of Stalin, he argued, he generally followed Lenin's view of the right of self-determination for national minorities. 79

## Towards the Manchester Pan African Congress

The prospect of a real 'British Socialist Common Wealth Federation - white and  coloured'  seemed  dim  to  Padmore  in  October  1944. A  survey  of  the British Socialist scene showed that the ILP lacked a revolutionary basis; the Ernest  Bevin  and  Aneurin  Bevan  conflict  was  a  quarrel  to  be  expected between  socialists  and  trade  union  capitalists  who  controlled  the  Labour Party,  a  reflection  of  Engels'  well-founded  warning  of  the  progressive bourgeoisification of the British working class. 80 And whatever hope there might have been of building a socialist Britain was strangled by the open 'love affair' between the Colonial Office and the trade unions. 81 If this was the case in Britain as the hostilities were coming to an end, what was the future of post-war Africa? American interest in Africa had become evident. The University of Pennsylvania produced the Office of Strategic Services

handbooks to stimulate interest in the continent. And, of course, business magazines  such  as  the  appropriately  named Fortune hoped  for  a  good return. Moreover, the Council on African Affairs organised a conference in April  1944  in  which  Kwame  Nkrumah  played  an  important  part.  The Council was the outcome of a meeting in London before the war between Paul  Robeson  and  Max  Yergan  (a  lecturer  and  one  of  the  sponsors  of Padmore's  IASB).  Their  International  Committee  on African Affairs  was established in New York with a board of directors including Ralph Bunche, Channing  Tobias,  Mordecai  Johnson,  Rene  Maran,  Leonard  Barnes  and, later Alphaeus  Hunton,  who DuBois described as the 'son of the greatest Negro secretary the American YMCA ever had'. 82

During  the  war,  the  number  of  Africans  in  America,  still  small,  was nonetheless influential. The African Students Association of North America was in touch with WASU. Africa House, bought in Harlem in 1942, served as  headquarters  for  visitors  such  as  Nkrumah  who,  in  1943  met  C.  L.  R. James there. Nkrumah was a graduate student and Fante language informant at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania.  James  (in  the  United  States  under  the name  Johnson)  gave  Nkrumah  a  letter  of  introduction  to  Padmore. 83 Subsequently James was deported.

When the Council of African Affairs met in New York on 14 April 1944 two proposals seemed particularly promising: firstly the establishment of an African press centre (put forward by K. A. B. Jones-Quartey of The African Interpreter) and  secondly,  an  international African  development  authority. Interestingly,  at  the  time,  even  the  communists  believed  that  the Africans were unable to rule themselves. One of them, Benjamin Davis felt that most of Africa was 'not ready for self-government, but nothing will teach these people faster than a war for world-wide democracy for which they provide the battleground'. 84

In  post-war  Britain,  African  and  colonial  matters  became  a  central theme among Pan African groups, as Moody convened a conference on the colonial  question. At  this  conference  (the  first  sponsored  by  the  LCP  for some ten years) a background paper was drafted by the National Council for Civil Liberties Overseas Sub-Committee. It cited the colour bar, unjust taxation, restriction of speech and movement, and Wallace-Johnson's case. The  conference  called  for  an  end  to  discrimination  in  Britain  and  that immediate  steps  be  taken  to  ensure  colonial  freedom.  A  'Charter  for

Coloured Peoples' was sent to the Prime Minister who high-handedly felt that  their  concern  was  misplaced.  At  this  point,  it  seemed  that  Moody moved closer to Padmore's position that the Soviet Union had solved the race relations problem. 85

Of major significance to the development of radical Pan Africanism was the formation of the Pan African Federation (the last and most ambitious of the pan bodies he was connected with) late in 1944 by Padmore and others such as Peter Milliard and Makonnen (both from British Guiana) who were based in Manchester.

In effect, the IASB had merged into the Pan African Federation, which became  the  British  section  of  the  Pan African  Congress  Movement.  This merger  took  place  in  1944,  when  representatives  of  black  and  colonial organisations  in  Britain  assembled  in  Manchester  to  form  a  Pan  African united front movement. The objects of the PAF were broadly based on the principles proclaimed at all the earlier Pan African Congresses:

- 1. To  promote  the  well-being  and  unity  of  African  peoples  and  peoples  of  African  descent throughout the world;
- 2. To demand self-determination and independence of African peoples, and other subject races from the domination of powers claiming sovereignty and trusteeship over them;
- 3. To secure equality of civil rights for African peoples and the total abolition of all forms of racial discrimination; and
- 4. To strive to cooperate between African peoples and others who share our aspirations. 86

According to Padmore, by pooling resources and liberating themselves from  the weakening  influence  of doctrinaire Marxism  which  British communists operating through certain Negro fellow travellers were trying to  impose  upon  the  African  national  liberation  movements  in  order  to exercise Stalinist control over them, the Pan African Federation was able to take  an  independent  ideological  position  on  the  colonial  question.  The Federation concerned itself with such theoretical problems as the methods and forms of organisation to be adopted by colonial peoples; the tactics and strategy of the national freedom struggle and the applicability of Gandhian non-violent,  non-co-operative  techniques  to  the  African  situation;  these were all openly discussed and debated in their journal, International African Opinion ,

The  PAF's  publications  branch,  the  Pan African  Institute,  published  a series  of  booklets. At  that  time,  a  young  academic  at  Howard  University, Eric Williams, produced a manuscript The Negro in the Caribbean which

was  thought  to  have  'no  market'  and  Padmore  was  asked  to  help  its publication  in  England.  Padmore's  colleague  Dennis  Dobson  (an  English teacher  involved  in  publishing)  felt  that  the  work  would  be  more  readily intelligible  in  America.  Eventually  Padmore  (conscious  of  the  stops  and starts in publication of his own books) brought out the manuscript himself by persuading the PAF to give the necessary £200.

Early  in  1945,  after  ILO  discussions  in  Philadelphia,  a  meeting  was convened in London to establish a world trades union organisation. The Pan Africanists had not lost sight of their goal -black freedom and independence. Not surprisingly therefore when the conference opened on 5 February in County Hall, London, it quickly became clear that 'peripheral' issues  such  as  colonialism  would  take  precedence.  Wallace-Johnson  was among the seven colonial trade unionists who attended. He explained that he  had  made  the  trip  to  London  because  the  British  recognised  that  the 'years  of  their  oppression  are  numbered'.  During  the  proceedings  there were real differences: the colonial delegates naturally wanted to discuss the peace  settlement  and  the  future  of  colonial  workers,  while  the  British representatives tried to avoid such issues.

When the conference ended on Saturday 17 February, Wallace-Johnson and Ken Hill, the delegate from Jamaica, were asked to stay on to assist in the drafting of a colonial programme for the British TUC. The meeting held on 26 February at Transport House was of major significance, marking the beginning  of  a  new  involvement  of  British  labour  with  colonial  workers. After this, the trade unionists were invited by the IASB and members of the PAF to  Manchester. There,  it  was  suggested  by  Padmore  that  since  there had not been a Pan African Conference since 1927, the time was right for another one to be held that September, perhaps in Paris. Although Padmore had talked about such a meeting in the mid-1950s and DuBois had hoped for  one  since  his  1927  Congress,  according  to  Hooker,  'this  was  the  first proposal for the Fifth Congress'. 87

The  idea  had  caught  Padmore's  imagination  and,  as  usual,  he  acted positively. Two  weeks  after meeting the colonial trade unionists, a 'provisional committee' was set up and a manifesto was drafted (a copy of which  was  sent  to  DuBois)  and  invitations  sent  to  various  organisations scattered around the world. At this point, there was a marked emphasis in Padmore's concentration on African affairs. He spent most of his time with African  and  Afro-Caribbean  students.  He  already  knew  Kenyatta  and

became a friend of Nkrumah who had arrived in London from the United States  with  James's  letter  of  introduction  during  the  war.  According  to Subasinghe:

He  was  becoming  more  and  more  cynical  about  the  role  of  the working  class  and  the  so-called  anti-imperialists  of  imperialist countries. He began to advocate the theory that the liberation of the colonial  peoples  was  their  own  responsibility  and  that  they  had  to rely on their own resources for their emancipation. Following from this he  became  more  and  more  interested  in  the  Pan  African movement  although  he  was  critical  of  some  of  the  early  PanAfricans.  He  held  Professor  DuBois  of  the  United  States  in  great respect and veneration. 88

Next,  an All-Colonial  Peoples'  Conference  organised  by  the  PAF  and the Federation  of  Indian  Associations  in  Britain,  WASU,  the  Ceylon Students' Association and the Burma Association was held on 10 June 1945 in  London.  By  now  colonial  demands  had  become  unanimous:  an  end  to imperialism,  the  application  of  the  Atlantic  Charter  to  the  colonies,  the release of political prisoners, and a universal end to the colour bar, among others. Some delegates felt an All-Negro Conference was necessary and that it  should be held jointly with the NAACP in September. Padmore, having expressed  this  view  earlier  was  optimistic  that  the  outcome  of  such  a meeting  could  lead,  in  the  near  future,  to  a  Pan  African  conference  in Africa. 89 Hitherto,  Paris  and  Africa  were  mentioned  as  possible  venues; London or elsewhere in Britain was not yet in the reckoning.

As it was, attention was turned to the struggle in Africa where Nigerian civil servants and technical workers were on strike against the cost of living and the marked lack of promotion for Africans. The PAF did not hesitate to support the strikers; an act of solidarity for which Chief A. Soyemi Coker of the  Nigerian Trades  Union  Congress  was  grateful.  Moreover,  at  a WASU meeting held in Conway Hall in July, Padmore, as the main speaker, spoke forcefully against the suppression of Azikiwe's newspapers. Later that year, WASU again invited him to address their study group. 90

There  was  a  marked  consolidation  of  Pan  African  brotherhood  and activity. Padmore's growing involvement in African affairs meant a lessening  of  Asian  concerns.  The  'Toilers  of  the  East'  did  not  have  the

immediate importance that the problems of his ancestral home Africa had. According  to  Hooker,  Indian  Independence  had  several  consequences  for those  concerned  with  African  freedom.  With  much  plausibility,  it  was argued that while Indians could devote attention to the cause of independence  elsewhere  in  the  colonial  world,  often  they  were  more concerned  with  their  own  problems  than  with  those  in  Africa.  Indeed, Padmore's  Indian  friend,  Kumria  found  a  steadily  widening  gap  between Indians  and Africans  in  London  after  Indian  Independence  in  1947. And despite  his  long  friendship  with  Brockway's  group,  Padmore  was  almost totally immersed in Gold Coast affairs.

Of the Pan African developments in 1945, the September issue of the LCP newsletter reported on a meeting held at the Pan African Institute at 66 Oxford Road, Manchester, on Sunday 12 August, to discuss preliminaries of a congress to be held in England during the month of October. This meeting of  representatives  of  the  various  'coloured'  organisations  in  Britain  was chaired by Dr Milliard. Padmore, Makonnen, Kenyatta and Peter Abrahams (a South African) were among those on the 'provisional committee' which worked  zealously  in  contacting  'Negro'  organisations  around  the  world, drafting an agenda, making  the  necessary  arrangements  for delegate accommodation and accreditation and in getting publicity.

A  significant  addition  to  this  group  of  organisers  was  Francis  K. Nkrumah  who,  on  his  arrival  in  London  in  May,  with  James's  letter  of recommendation, met Padmore. They liked each other and quickly developed  a  warm,  brotherly  friendship  and  working  relationship.  Soon, Nkrumah  became  Padmore's  'co-political  Secretary'. 91   Thus,  a  14-year working relationship had begun. Although many of Padmore's friends were not as impressed, Padmore almost instantly recognised the singlemindedness  of  purpose  in  Nkrumah's  commitment  to  Africa.  Until  then, Azikiwe  was  Padmore's  man  in Africa.  Now  his  attention  was  shifted  to Nkrumah whose commitment and  activity  in  London-based  organisations offered  real  prospects  of  African  freedom. As  it  was,  Padmore  was  only three  years  older  but  with  a  greater  fund  of  experience  to  draw  from. According  to  Professor  John  Phillips,  Padmore's  influence  was  clearly  a source of help to Nkrumah, but it was not his but Nkrumah's genius that inspired  and  waged  the  fight  for  the  political,  economic  and  spiritual freedom  of Africa. 92 Thus,  George  Padmore  the  elder  had  met  and  soon

began work with the younger revolutionary towards freeing Africa from the stranglehold of imperialism.

According to Immaneul Geiss, DuBois had earlier been in touch with Moody about the prospect of such a Congress, but of course, to be held at a much  later  date. 93 It is  therefore  not  surprising  that  an  LCP  member, Sampson Morris, made the announcement of the Congress by writing in the Defender that the conference would take place in London. This seemed to have  been  the  first  public  statement  that  the  Congress  was  to  be  held  in Britain. DuBois was also trying to organise another Pan African Congress, but was unhappy about the difficulties, namely the transportation problems of bringing together delegates and his reluctance to allow the planning of another  African  meeting  to  overseas  'Negroes'.  In  fact,  WASU  also  had doubts about convening another Pan African conference outside Africa. It came as no surprise then that  when DuBois heard of the British plans of Padmore and his associates,  he  wished  them  well.  Indeed,  it  would  seem that he saw these developments in September 1945 as the forerunner of the Pan African Congress he had in mind for a later date. Thus, he announced on 29 September he was coming to London as the NAACP representative. He was pleased and expected, given his age, 'nothing too spectacular'. He remarked  that  'There  is  no  reason  to  think  that  the  present  Congress  is going to be more 'Pan African' than the others'. Indeed, he considered the Congress  'a preliminary one'. The  composition  of delegates at this conference  represented  a  change  in  emphasis  from  previous  Pan African Congresses. Previously attendance had been overwhelmingly educated and middle-  and  upper-class  Africans,  whereas  now,  invitations  included  a number of African trade unionists who had already spoken eloquently on colonial matters. This coming together of the two groups would test the true character of the Congress. Padmore, in charge of planning may well have perceived  this  likelihood  in  making  the  arrangements  so  that  the  base  of representation  could  be  broadened;  a  necessary  prerequisite  in  mobilising the colonial masses in the struggle for national independence.

Finally, the Pan African conference opened on Monday 15 October in Chorlton Town Hall, Manchester, attended by an estimated 100 delegates. Peter Abrahams disputed this figure claiming twice as many. The flags of Haiti, Liberia and Ethiopia were placed in the hall where Mrs Amy Jacques Garvey (widow of Marcus Garvey) chaired the first session on the colour problem in Britain. By now, the problems were a familiar cry:

unemployment  ashore  and  at  sea,  the  support  of  illegitimate  children fathered  by  black Americans  and  discriminatory  treatment  by  the  police. The Nigerian WASU delegate was forthright in encapsulating the problems of black people in Britain: 'If the British people think they have the right to live in Africa', he said, 'then we have the right to stay here. We have the right to get together and see that something is done for us here.' 94 Another speaker  representing  the Coloured  People's  Association  in  Edinburgh pointed  out  that  the African  'student  class'  in  Britain  had  separated  itself from  the  general  body  of  black  people  in  Britain  and  that  this  made  the struggle 'more difficult'. 95

The Tuesday session was chaired by DuBois whom Padmore introduced.  Nkrumah  was  the  rapporteur.  DuBois  had  been  to  all  five Congresses but was never treated to the kind of speech he was about to hear from Joe Annan, a trade unionist from the Gold Coast who said:

I am here as a workman, a man who wields tools, a man who knows no colour. I want you to feel that nothing we can do here is of any avail  unless  we  are  in  a  position  to  implement  the  resolutions  that we  are  going  to  make.  …  So  I  suggest  that  before  this  Congress breaks  up  on  Sunday  we  set  up  administrative  machinery  to  cope with the difficulties which lie ahead of us. My workers have given me this mandate: to inform you that they are prepared to spend their last  penny  in  order  to  maintain  an  office  in  London.  That  is  a practical issue. 96

This kind of speech struck responses in Nkrumah which he said, 'Shot into  limbo  the  gradualist  aspirations  of  our  African  middle  classes  and intellectuals  and  expressed  the  solid  down-to-earth  will  of  our  workers, trade  unionists,  farmers  and  peasants  who  were  decisively  represented  at Manchester, for independence.'

On the third day, the Congress rescinded the appointment of chairperson for each session and Padmore declared DuBois permanent Chairman 'as a token  of  esteem  and  respect'.  The  Congress  passed  resolutions  on  West Africa, the Congo and North Africa, East Africa, the Union South Africa, the three British Protectorates, the West  Indies (urging West  Indian Federation), another on the problems of black seamen in England, one on race relations in the United Kingdom and one on South Africa. Delegates

were  urged  to  implement  all  Congress  resolutions.  Nkrumah  felt  that  the Congress  was  important  because  'for  the  first  time,  the  delegates  who attended it were practical men of action and not, as was the case at the four previous conferences, merely idealists contenting themselves with writing theses but quite unable or unwilling to take any active part in dealing with the African problem. Like Garveyism, the first four conferences were not born  of  indigenous  African  consciousness.'  Thus,  it  was  this  Fifth  Pan African  Congress  that  provided  the  outlet  for  African  nationalism  and brought about the awakening of an African political consciousness, which became a mass movement of Africa for the Africans.

Significantly  Nkrumah  emphasised  that  the  seizure  of  political  power was the first step, the necessary prerequisite to 'complete social economic and  political  emancipation';  and  that  the  strike  and  boycott  were  the weapons. However, unless colonial intellectuals realised their own responsibilities,  the  masses  would  not  realise  their  strength.  He  added: 'Today there is only one road to effective action - the organisation of the masses. And in that organisation the educated Colonials must join. Colonial and subject Peoples of the World - Unite!' 97

At  the  final  session  of  this  historic  Congress,  DuBois  was  elected International  President  and  Liberia  was  to  be  host  for  a  Sixth  Congress. Having achieved a notable Pan African success, Padmore had not forgotten the toilers of the East. He proposed that greetings be sent to the 'masses in India'  and  a  statement  to  the  peoples  of  Indonesia  and  Vietnam.  DuBois returned  to  the  United  States  convinced  that  he  had  participated  in  an important  event;  there was  a  new  colonial  abroad,  he  wrote  in  the Defender . 98 For  Padmore,  who  had  via  Communism  been  central  in convening  this  successful  Fifth  Pan  African  Congress,  the  end  of  the Congress  marked  the  beginning  of  a  new  dawn  in Africa.  This  post-war turning point deserved a fanfare but significantly, with the exception of the New Leader and the black American press, the white British press ignored the Congress.

After the Congress, the PAF remained in Manchester but the 'Committee' was located in Padmore's London residence. Wallace-Johnson suggested  the  formation  of  a  West  African  Secretariat  which  Nkrumah welcomed. Thus, the West African National Secretariat was established with Nkrumah  as  Secretary.  Based  in  Gray's  Inn  Road,  WANS  published  a

journal New African which was short-lived. At the end of August 1946, a joint conference was called by WASU and WANS. The delegates (including West Africa) reaffirmed the goals of the Fifth Congress and felt that a West African federation was an indispensable first step towards a Pan Africa. It was agreed to call another meeting which never took place. According to Padmore,  their aim was  a United Socialist States of Africa. 99 The conference was not held because Nkrumah was called home to work with the United Gold Coast Convention. 100

During  the  summer  of  1946  Padmore  was  asked  by  the  Free  Indian Press to report on the Paris peace conference. While in Paris he distributed copies  of  his  new  book How  Russia  Transformed  Her  Colonial  Empire . From a  journalistic  viewpoint  he  was  fortunate  in  meeting  Ho  Chi  Minh who gave him a two-hour interview. According to Padmore's nephew, Dr Luke, Padmore had met Ho during his Comintern days. Hooker has argued that although  this may  be  true, Padmore's  references  to Ho  'rather contradict the notion'. However, the connection was close enough: thereafter,  he  became  'the  unofficial  guardian  of  Viet-Minh  interests  in London'. 101 On  the  question  of the peace  conference,  Padmore  had misgivings, in spite of the fact that it was more democratic than the 1919 conference. Overall he saw little hope of serious consideration of African affairs and was concerned with the encroaching threat of American global strategy.

Significantly, the British Centre Against Imperialism came into being in February 1946 - a post-war counterpart to the League Against Imperialism. Padmore  spoke  at  their  first  meeting  on  'Africa  and  the  West  Indies', referring  to  the  Fifth  Pan  African  Congress  as  the  first  step  in  the  long struggle.  A  month  earlier,  he  had  launched  his  newsletter The  Colonial Parliamentary Bulletin: A Monthly Record of the Colonies in Westminister (produced in his Cranleigh Street flat by the African Press Agency for the IASB) which lasted two years. During this period Padmore was optimistic that the second Labour government would combat racial discrimination and tended to blame American troops for racial conflict in Britain. His unusual optimism  was  reflected  in  the  fact  that  he  felt  government  action  would come about directly and largely from the agitations of the PAF. 102

After  the  war,  the  shift  in  Padmore's  thinking  towards  West  African affairs had become more marked. Ever concerned with relating the struggle

in  Britain  to Africa  he  was  again  involved  in  the  joint  sponsorship  of  an anti-colonial  meeting  between  the  LCP  and  the  PAF  in  December  1946. Padmore's  wide  interests  had  brought  him  in  contact  with  many  wellknown  Blacks.  Earlier,  in  1944,  through  membership  of  the  Coloured Writer's Association, Padmore met Richard Wright the American novelist, thus beginning a long friendship and collaboration.

The next year, in May, Padmore, concerned with the growing unrest in East  Africa  attacked  Arthur  Creech-Jones,  the  Colonial  Secretary.  This helped  their  relationship  little.  After  Padmore's  new  alliance  with  Leslie Hale  in  the  House  of  Commons,  Brockway  returned  to  the  House  and 'became  the  very  natural  and  very  distinguished  leader  of  the  group interested  in  colonial  affairs  on  the  labour  back  benches'. 103 That  same month, Harold Moody was buried. Thus ended the uneasy alliance between the  black  'Moderates'  and  the  black  'Radicals'.  Padmore  attended  the funeral  as  the  PAF  representative.  In  effect,  this  was  the  end  of  the  LCP which  had  worked  dedicatedly  for  reforms.  Predictably,  after  Moody's death,  Padmore  had  little  to  do  with  the  LCP,  although  Dorothy  Pizer remained on the editorial committee.

Soon after, when a delegation from the National Council of Nigeria and Cameroons,  led  by  Azikiwe,  arrived  in  London  to  protest  against  the Richards  Constitution  in  Nigeria,  Padmore,  acting  as  Press  Secretary,  put Azikiwe's  group  into  direct  contact  with  Nkrumah's  WANS,  WASU  and PAF.  Nkrumah  was  active  in  all  three.  The  minimal  involvement  of  the NCNC at the Manchester Congress had, through Azikiwe's endorsement of the Congress's aims, a closer involvement.  The  coming  together  of Nkrumah, Azikiwe (Padmore's great African hopes) and other representatives in London,  consolidated  West  African  aspirations  and interests.  It  must  be  remembered  that  in  all  this  Padmore's  role  was essential.

The  major  break  came  for  African  aspirations  when  Nkrumah  was offered the UGCC  Secretaryship. With Padmore's strong approval, Nkrumah accepted. According to Brockway, 'Padmore exerted a considerable influence in getting Nkrumah to go back to Ghana, despite the reactionary leadership of the Gold Coast nationalist movement.' In February 1948 riots had broken out in Accra, marking the beginning of Nkrumah's positive  action  campaign.  Evidently,  Britain's  continued  control  over  the Gold  Coast  was  at risk. Padmore  condemned  the  police  who  were

responsible for the violence, and at a rally in Trafalgar Square he challenged Rees Williams,  the  Colonial  Under-Secretary,  who  argued  that  the  rioters were  not  nationalists  but  communists.  Padmore  argued  that  the  Labour government showed more concern for the United Company of Africa than the  real  needs  of  colonial  peoples.  Padmore's  radical  stance  received  the support  of  the  reformist  LCP,  when  he  argued  that  the  'spectre  of  Pan Africanism  is  haunting  the  'dark  continent''.  The  confrontation  in Accra following Nkrumah's return to the Gold Coast had set in train a process of enlargement  of  Nkrumah's  past.  Already  he  was  being  referred  to  as 'Professor of Philosophy at Pennsylvania University'.

In the summer, Padmore had reported on the Paris Congress of Peoples (an international socialist conference) attended by Brockway, McNair of the ILP,  and  Bob  Edwards  of  the  Chemical  Workers  Union.  Significantly, several delegates attended 'the last international socialist gathering to which Africans were attracted in significant numbers'. 104

Between 1948 and early 1957, Padmore continued to speak and write. After  speaking  at  the  ILP  Summer  Schools  at  Bangor  on  the  topic  'Is Imperialism Dead?' in 1950, he was invited to visit the Gold Coast at a time when Nkrumah felt confident that the Convention Peoples' Party would win the  elections  in  February  1951.  Indeed,  he  wanted  Padmore  to  write  the history  of  the  post-war  events.  During  this  visit,  Padmore  also  went  to Nigeria. He was optimistic that Azikiwe 'could emerge as a truly national figure in the Nkrumah sense only if tribalism were eliminated'. 105 Padmore was  invited back  to  Accra (in August  1951)  to  witness Nkrumah's installation  as  Leader  of  Government  Business  at  the  re-opening  of  the Legislative Council.

On  his  return  to  London  in  early  October,  he  began  work  on  a  new book, The Gold Coast Revolution , which was printed in spring 1953. In the book, Padmore depicted Nkrumah 'as the embodiment of the hopes which international socialists had for renascent Africa and claimed that the Gold Coast colony had gone down a road all Africa would follow'. 106  Another book to consider with Nkrumah's call for a Pan African Congress early in 1955  was  Padmore's  last  and  best  known  work, Pan  Africanism  or Communism?

He regarded Richard Wright's book Black Power as 'a very good book indeed'.  In 1956  Padmore  seemed  preoccupied  with  the  Gold  Coast

elections.  Even  at  that  stage,  he  feared  that  the  tricky  British  imperialists were likely to pull a 'fast one' given the opportunity. 107 Indeed he was ever aware of the dangers, and was one of the first to identify the 'new danger' of neo-colonialism.

Padmore's hectic work-rate had continued. During the summer of 1956, his health had deteriorated to the extent that he had to cancel his summer school  lecture.  He  was  admitted  to  hospital  and  confined  to  bed  with  a severe chill on the bladder.

His friend Dr Clarke recommended a warm climate. In the meantime, his  work Pan-Africanism  or  Communism? was  published  with  a  strong preface  by  Richard  Wright.  And  significantly,  the  radicalisation  of  Pan Africanism had brought about its first triumph in Ghana, the 'Black Star' of Africa.

In  March  1957  Padmore, Dr Clarke and Professor Arthur Lewis were among  the prominent West Indians invited to attend the Ghanaian Independence  ceremonies  in  Accra.  Other  guests  included  his  former teacher, Ralph Bunche. Hugh Smythe wrote in the Crisis that Padmore 'is the  silent  hero  of  Ghana  and  a  figure  venerated  and  respected  throughout black Africa'. By August, although he had started yet another project for the Pan African News Agency , he announced that he was moving to Accra. One of his concerns at that time was the prospects of West Indian Federation and the  role  of  Eric Williams. 108 He  responded to the lies in the British press about Nkrumah by stating that Nkrumah was 'the George Washington, the Father  of  his  country'.  Now  that  Ghana  had  achieved  Independence, Padmore monitored its progress and retained a close interest in Nigeria. He was now fully committed to consolidation in Ghana and liberation in Africa as a whole.

By  the  autumn  of  1957,  he  was  appointed  as  Nkrumah's  adviser  on African  affairs.  Before  he  left  London,  Dr  David  Pitt,  who  was  active  in Labour  Party  politics,  whose  surgery  was  used  as  a  meeting  place  for nationalist groups, organised a small party in November, at which Padmore was surprised with the presentation of a briefcase. 109 Among the guests was C.  L.  R.  James,  the  only  representative  from  the  pre-war  crowd.  Most  of those  present  never  saw  him  again.  In  effect,  Padmore's  days  in  London were over. He had travelled through America, Europe, Asia: now, he was heading 'home' to Africa.

In  Ghana,  he  was  disturbed  to  discover  substantial  opposition  to  his presence. If Padmore was treated this way, one wonders how Garvey and his followers  might  have  been  received  in  Africa.  In  July  1959,  as Nkrumah's personal adviser, Padmore attended a meeting of the heads of state of Liberia, Guinea and Ghana in the village of Saniquelle in Liberia. In this 'miserable location' he contracted dysentery which seriously undermined  his  delicate  health.  By  then,  he  had  already  felt  a  sense  of discouragement at the obstacles in the path of Pan African unity. Overall, he was  sick,  disappointed,  uncomfortable  in  public  life  and  'unhappy  in  his private circumstances'. Moreover, his deteriorating health could no longer be ignored. In September, he took leave and arrived in London for medical examination. Dr Clarke diagnosed a severe liver deterioration and Padmore was  admitted  to  University  College  Hospital  on  Sunday  20  September. Three days later, though he fought for life, he died. In his foreword to Pan Africanism  or  Communism? Wright  wrote  that  Padmore  was  the  greatest living  authority  on  the  African  nationalist  movements,  who  not  only understood  their  leaders'  aims,  structures  and  ideologies,  but  whose  life embodied those movements, aims and ideologies. 110

After  a  funeral  service  at  Golders  Green  Crematorium  on  Monday  28 September, Padmore's ashes, at Nkrumah's request, were flown to Ghana where they were interred at Christianborg Castle on 4 October. Moved by this loss, Nkrumah said:

When I first met George Padmore in London some fifteen years ago, we both realised from the beginning that we thought along the same lines  and  talked  the  same  language. There  existed  between  us  that rare affinity for which one searches for so long but seldom finds in another  human  being.  We  became  friends  at  the  moment  of  our meeting and our friendship developed into the indescribable relationship that existed between two brothers. 111

In death the Ghanaians began to institutionalise Padmore; but the man himself  was  quickly  forgotten.  In  fact  his  entire  pre-1957  career  was  put aside  by  friends  and  enemies  alike  who  preferred  to  concentrate  on  the seemingly  glamorous  last  years  in  Ghanaian  employment.  Padmore,  the 'black  revolutionary',  'father  of  African  emancipation',  was  much  more. According to Hooker, he was 'the expositor of the black man's dignity, the

nagging conscience of a white man's world'. Indeed, for most of his life he moved  in  the  white  man's  world,  traversing  the  physical  and  intellectual Pan  African  quadrangle  and  beyond  in  a  searching  journey  from  the periphery to the centre; from Communism to Pan Africanism. In effect, he had joined the ranks of the Pan Africanists Blyden and Sylvester-Williams, whom he held in such high esteem.

## The place of Pan Africanism in history

Pan  Africanism,  seen  by  one  observer  as  a  twentieth-century  historical phenomenon with nineteenth-century roots  and  precursors,  in  most  cases, involved  small  and  weak  groups  which  came  together  to  form  ephemeral organisations. Their ideas and plans printed in transient journals, to some extent, explain the scarcity of research material and the dearth of historical scholarship on Pan Africanism until recently. Of course, Pan Africanism is also a product of history, particularly in relation to decolonisation in Africa which brought its first successes.

It  has  been  argued  that  a  tendency  to  emotionalism, lack of precision, general lists  of  demands or declamatory statements, a lack of attention to clarification  of  the  movement's  basic  theoretical  principles,  resulted  in  a lack  of  committing  anyone  to  a  specific  course  of  action.  Together,  these factors  contributed  to  the  fundamental  weaknesses  of  Pan  Africanism. Moreover,  instead  of  becoming  the  ideology  of  consistent  modernisation, Pan Africanism, according to Geiss, was either romanticised or merged into the  'lost  paradise'  of  Africa, 112 or  attempts  were  made  to  integrate  both modern and traditional elements.

Geiss,  however,  in  making  a  valid  criticism  of  this  contradiction, neglected the fundamental fact that without an understanding of traditional Africa  and  the  black  man's  history,  it  is  remarkable  that  a  historical movement such as Pan Africanism could begin at all, never mind cope with the problems of modernisation. Therefore, it is no good attacking DuBois's enthusiasm for Liberia in 1923-24 (a brief period given his long life) and Nkrumah's pagan ritual at Aggrey's grave in November 1942, as 'manifestations  of  this  inner  contradiction'.  Indeed,  the  presence  of  this dynamic  was  a  reflection  of  the  historical  shifts  and  flexibility  in  the development  of  Pan  Africanism.  Cut  and  dried  principles,  given  this hazardous course, simply could not be applied. Unfortunately, Geiss chose to ignore the consistent principles within which most Pan  African

organisations  operated.  With  few  exceptions,  the  goal  of  all  of  them  was hardly in doubt; there was a fundamental continuity.

In  spite  of  its  organisational  'weaknesses',  Pan Africanism  has  had  a major impact in bringing about the decolonisation of Africa. Pan Africanism and African nationalism benefited from two basic factors: firstly, the lack among  colonial  powers  of  a  colonial  policy  of  modernisation  in  their colonies;  and  secondly,  the  fear  of  revolt  in  the  colonies  if  African nationalists  became  disillusioned  and  turned  to  Communism. 113   Geiss argued  that  the  suddenness  with  which  post-war  developments  led  to  the long-awaited  triumph  of  Pan  Africanism,  Independence,  also  brought  its post-Independence problems. But, either a short or long period of adjustment would have mattered little in the face of the looming problems of neocolonialism, which troubled Padmore.

Pan  African  leaders  have  also  been  criticised  for  'pushing  ahead  so impatiently'! After a long history of slavery and oppression, how else could they  proceed?  Clearly,  the  Pan African  nationalists  after  1945,  felt  it  was better  to  govern  themselves  badly  than  go  on  being  governed  by  foreign imperialists.  In  concluding  his  study  of  the  Pan African  movement  Geiss wrote:

All 'Pan' movements in the underdeveloped societies face the same basic problem, the clash between the traditional world and modern influences. In trying to solve this conflict, universal to our age, the modernized elites of each country have acted in very different ways, according to their specific historical circumstances. … It offers an approach  to  the  history  of  Africa  and  of  the  Afro-Americans.  It throws light upon new aspects of European racism and colonialism, against which Pan Africanism rose in revolt. 114

But, the essential Pan Africanist Marxist historian and thinker, C. L. R. James  (85  at  the  time  of  writing),  in  his  conclusion  to A  History  of  Pan African  Revolt ,  commenting  on  the  fact  that  Dr  Nyerere  had  broken  to pieces the old system of education and substituted a genuinely socialist and humanist  procedure  for  youth  in  Tanzania,  wrote:  'It  can  fertilise  and reawaken the mortuary that is socialist theory and practice in the advanced countries. 'Marxism is a Humanism' is the exact reverse of the truth. The African builders of a humanist society show that today all humanism finds

itself in close harmony  with the original conceptions and aims of Marxism.' 115

The black radical intelligentsia had, by the late 1950s, left Britain. They returned  to  the  colonies  to  educate,  organise  and  involve  the  masses. As they expected, the post-war colonial world had not changed materially. The problems were of massive proportions: poverty, malnutrition, high unemployment,  low  wages,  deplorable  standards  of  living  and  working conditions enforced by local and foreign capitalists. In Britain, however, the reverse was true.

In the post-war prosperity, Padmore was one of the first to recognise the effects of neo-colonialism. British capital demanded cheap black labour, as the British working class achieved upward occupational mobility and social status. The vacated, low-paid, low-status, dead-end jobs, at the base of the occupational pyramid were filled by black migrant newcomers - the black working class. This substitution would, in time, weaken working class unity and increase the racist tendencies of white workers who formed part of the substantial middle class in post-war Britain.

## 7 Post-war Immigration:

## Racism, Riot and Legislation

The newcomers who arrived in Britain between 1947 and 1962 dispersed to several parts of the country. Although the majority stayed in London, many went to Liverpool, Manchester, Cardiff, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Bradford, Leeds, Leicester, Wolverhampton and other towns and cities. In short,  at  least  initially,  they  joined  family  and  friends  who  had  preceded them.  This  chapter  will  concentrate  essentially  on  the  problems  West Indians  faced  in  Nottingham  and  Notting  Hill  in  London,  where  white racism greeted them, increased and exploded into racial riots. In terms of both  geography  and  time,  the  focus  of  British  racism  had  shifted  from Cardiff  and  Liverpool  to  Nottingham  and  Notting  Hill. And  interestingly, given a larger and growing black presence, the same repeated calls for black repatriation  now  had  a  similar  and  unprecedented  urgency.  Let  us  now examine  the  developments  in  these  specific  areas  and,  most  importantly, how the outcome profoundly affected all black people in Britain and indeed, elsewhere.

The main causes of the migration of West Indians in the post-war period were the pressure of  population  and  the  high  level  of  unemployment  and under-employment.  Furthermore,  low  wages  and  the  lack  of  opportunity

had  caused  West  Indians  to  look  beyond  the  Caribbean  for  economic development.  Moreover,  doors  to  other  countries  were  closed.   The  1952 1 McCarran-Walter  Act,  for  instance,  reduced  considerably  the  number  of West Indians going to the United States.

As British subjects, West Indians naturally turned to the more accessible British prospects. They were brought up in the British tradition, held British values  and  they  had  a  legal  right  of  free  entry  into  the  United  Kingdom. Britain's post-war economic development held real promise. Job opportunities in Britain were clearly greater than in the West Indies. News of  West  Indians  (some  8000  of  them)  who  had  served  in  the  Royal  Air Force and in the munitions factories during the Second World War, became well-known  in  the  Caribbean.  Optimism  was  engendered  by  the  fact  that some West Indians had reached commissioned rank and in spite of evidence of discrimination, the majority of those who served were able to admit 'the absence  of  discrimination  in  the  armed  services'.  Through  their  war-time experiences,  West  Indians  were  introduced  to  an  advanced  industrialised economy.  The  precedent  they  set  made  it  easier  for  their  fellow  West Indians (and indeed some who had returned home) to come to Britain after the war.

By  1950,  West  Indian  immigration  to  Britain  had  already  begun  in  a small  and  unorganised  way.  There  were  no  regular  steamship  services between the Caribbean and Britain. In response to a growing demand, these services soon expanded. Going to Britain became a new line of enterprise for  local  businessmen  and  travel  agents,  which  in  turn  had  a  snowball effect. Moreover,  while  West  Indian  governments  did  not  encourage emigration, most of them permitted it. Indeed, in one case, the government was  actively  involved.  In  view  of  it  having  'the  most  densely  populated territory'  of  the  West  Indies  Federation,  with  'high  unemployment'  and  a long history of emigration, the Barbados government actually gave assistance  to  migrants  and  helped  to  arrange  jobs  and  accommodation  in Britain.  The  number  receiving  such  aid,  however,  was  small.  In  general, West  Indian  migrants  made  their  own  arrangements  to  get  to  Britain. Warnings of housing and employment difficulties did not deter prospective migrants. Those who eventually made the trip were determined to succeed.

On arrival  in  Britain,  the  authorities  did  not  ignore  the  immigrant,  at least initially. Whatever help they received became increasingly politically motivated. The British Caribbean Welfare Service established in 1956 was

one  such  body  designed  to  help  migrants.  Two  years  later,  the  BCWS, granted a 'more definite social status', was renamed the Migrant Services Division  of  the  Commission  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  the  West  Indies, British Guiana and British Honduras. This body (supplied with information from  West  Indian  governments)  increasingly  supervised  the  arrival  of migrants to Britain.

In  the  1950s,  more  West  Indians  came  to  Britain  than  did  Africans, Indians and Pakistanis. According to an official estimate, there were about 210,000 black people, a small minority, less than half of 1 per cent of the total British population.  Though similar to the black population of London 2 in the late eighteenth century (in that it was  relatively small) the circumstances in 1958, in many ways, presented a 'new situation' of a black population  that  was  growing,  that  came  to  Britain  'voluntarily'  and  was 'free'.

Moreover  (with  this  increased  West  Indian  immigration)  during  the 1950s  black  people  became  far  more  visible.  In  recent  times  no  other minority  group  aroused  emotions  and  controversies  of  the  same  intensity and on the same scale as the Blacks. For example, when the Poles migrated to  Britain  during  and  after  the  Second  World  War  (indeed  this  was  a conscious  British  policy  to  avoid  black  settlement)  there  was  far  less interest,  although  the  number  of  Poles  settled  in  Britain  in  1960  was roughly equivalent to that of the West Indians. The difference between the two was that West Indians in Britain were (and are) more visible, by virtue of colour, than the Poles. Whatever truth there is in the argument that the difficulties  of  all  newcomers  to  Britain  are  alike,  it  must  be  remembered that it is also true that the difficulties of black people confront them in an accentuated form. It is futile to argue that they are simply immigrants. As black  migrants  they  were  made  to  feel  alien  in  almost  every  way.  The dilemma  of  colour  prejudice  stalked  black  people  wherever  they  went  in Britain.  White  newcomers,  by  contrast,  had  alternatives:  they  could,  for example,  fade  into  the  rest  of  the  population  and  in  time  lose  the  more obvious  marks  of  foreignness  such  as  accent.  Dark-skinned  migrants, however, could not get rid of their colour, even if they wanted to. Given this fact, black migrants set about making a living in Britain. Firstly, they had to find accommodation and, crucially, the employment for which they came.

In London, through sheer necessity, West Indians tended to concentrate in  six  main  areas,  two  of  which  continue  to  be  of  particular  importance.

Significantly, each contained well over one-fifth of all West Indians in the London  group.  The  first  was  the  West  area  stretching  from  Paddington, through  North  Kensington  and  Notting  Hill  to  Shepherd's  Bush  and Hammersmith.  The  second,  was  the  South  West  area  with  migrants' settlements  in  Brixton,  Stockwell  and  South  Lambeth.  Since  1955,  there have been slight shifts in the importance of these two areas, with more West Indians moving to the South West area. From 1956 to the end of 1958 more migrants  went  to  Brixton  than  to  Notting  Hill,  thus  belying  the  popular assumption  that  Notting  Hill  was  the  main  reception  area  for  black migrants. 3

In  spite  of  the  concentrations  there  were  very  few  dense  geographical clusters of West Indians in London. Indeed, such 'clusters' existed only in a few districts, particularly in and around Brixton and North Kensington. It was estimated that less than one in five of all the migrants in London lived in  these  clusters,  while  over  40  per  cent  lived  in  streets  where  by  1960, there was no indication of multiple West Indian tenancy. According to one observer,  these  dense  concentrations  were  not  'ghettoes'.  Thus,  it  was argued that the images of Notting Hill and Brixton as 'Harlems' in London was far removed from reality, for only a small proportion of Blacks lived in these  places  and  in  most  of  these  districts  it  was  not  black  people  but Whites who were predominant. 4

Be that as it may, these districts were not considered for redevelopment and  would,  in  time,  become  'decaying'  areas.  With  a  substantial  and growing black presence in London, the problems of the inner city (already decaying and depressed) had its effect on the newcomers in such areas as housing, education and the crucial area of employment. Indeed, these were the core problems of settlement and adjustment of a steadily accumulating black working class in Britain.

## Housing

On arrival in Britain, employment and housing were clearly the two crucial problems facing black migrants in London. These were indeed problems of a  personal kind. Whether major or minor, their difficulties were rooted in race  and  colour  prejudice  which  was  (and  still  is)  essentially  the  black experience  in  finding  jobs  and  houses.  Between  1954  and  1958,  housing

was at least as serious a problem as employment. Indeed they were directly related. In fact housing appeared to be the more intractable of the two. The Migrant Services was rarely able to assist the migrants (to their satisfaction) in  finding  accommodation.  Consequently,  mutual  help  within  the  migrant community was the only real alternative.

West Indian newcomers to London initially tended to spend one night at least  with  a  friend  or  relative.  Few  migrants  arrived  without  an  address. Temporary  accommodation  was  found  occasionally  in  Salvation  Army hostels  and  by  welfare  officers  (from  the  Colonial  Office,  the  London County Council and the Red Cross) who met them. Similar arrangements were made for nurses and for those Barbadians who came to Britain under their government's scheme. The West Indian Welfare Officer, employed by the London Transport Executive was charged with finding accommodation for workers recruited by the Executive. Few migrants, however, had been helped in this way. Indeed, the vast majority found accommodation through personal contacts and sheer determination.

Fortunately, the newcomers were not only able to draw on the help of recent migrants, but also from those who had earlier established themselves in London.  In effect, their houses became  'hostels' for newcomers. Unofficial  'reception  centres'  of  this  kind  were  established;  one  in  North Kensington, several in Camber well and Brixton, one in Islington and one in Hampstead.  Outside  London,  two  became  well-known  to  Welfare Officers  as  'Sloobucks'  (Slough,  Berkshire)  and  'Baldockerts'  (Baldock, Hertfordshire). 5

The scattered locations of these 'reception centres' (most within a radius of  six  miles  from  Charing  Cross)  avoided  the  creation  of  a  'coloured quarter'.  Migrants  had,  however,  frequently  tried  to  get  more  permanent accommodation as close to their first bases as possible. The inertia of the islanders was evident in this. 'We're all in the same boat now, boy', West Indians often repeated.

Another factor in the location of these 'first bases' was due to chance, as in the case of West Indian settlement in Brixton. For example, when the first large  group  of  West  Indian  migrants  arrived  in  1948  on  the Empire Windrush , 242  were  temporarily  accommodated  in  Clapham  Common Underground Station which had been used as an air-raid shelter. Blacks who sought a living in Britain presented officials with a problem.

The Colonial Office was now seriously concerned about the Windrush men.  Mr  Creech  Jones  wrote  to  Councillor  Jack  Simpson,  Mayor  of Lambeth,  whose  borough  was  close  to  Clapham  Common,  and  asked  if some welcome could be arranged. Councillor Simpson with an allowance of £600 for the whole year said he could entertain only forty Jamaicans. So, on the  afternoon  of  Wednesday,  3  June,  in  a  room  over  the Astoria  Cinema, Brixton,  a  representative  group  of  Jamaicans  were  invited  to  tea  by  the Mayor.  Local  officers  and  two  MPs  were  also  there.  In  expansive  mood, Colonel Marcus Lipton, Labour Member for Brixton, told the men that they should regard Brixton as their second home. The Mayor offered his good wishes and commented: 'When I heard of your coming here I was moved. A journey like yours does not take place without good reason.' Afterwards, the migrants were treated to a free cinema show. On their return to the airraid  shelter  that  evening  the  forty  men  described  the  reception  to  their friends.  According  to  Joyce  Eggington,  'They  spoke  with  enthusiasm, joyous that a few people had taken the trouble to make them feel welcome. The limited sum of money spent was not important: tea and cakes had been as  effective  as  champagne.  In  the  unknown  and  perplexing  vastness  of England, the Jamaicans now felt they could be sure of one place. Brixton was friendly. In Brixton they would make their homes.' 6

After this welcome most of the men were employed locally which was an  added  incentive  to  stay  in  the  district.  This  was  only  the  beginning  of migrant settlement.

The areas of West Indian settlement in London (North, West and South) had  several  common  features.  These  areas,  by  virtue  of  their  history  and location,  offered  accommodation  (albeit  shabby)  to  the  mass  of  migrants who constituted a low income group. In the main, West Indians could not find accommodation in the working class districts of the East End and the southern riverside boroughs where, because of the stability of the population and tenancies, there was no room for sub-division. The ranks of the white working class were effectively closed. Moreover, the newcomers at that time were not eligible for the new municipal flats and houses built by the LCC and the Metropolitan boroughs. The middle class and upper class districts of Hampstead, Chelsea, Westminster and South Kensington, among others,  were  closed  to  most  of  the  West  Indian  migrants,  except  a  small minority who were more prosperous.

Indeed many old streets and squares became fashionable and expensive, particularly because, in general, the residential capacity of Central London had  been  (and  is  still  being)  depleted.  Office  blocks,  stores  and  hotels competed  with  each  other  for  space  in  central  London.  Meanwhile,  the scarcity of residential accommodation  and  space  was  not  effectively counteracted  by  official  planning  policy.  In  fact,  the  London  planners' objective was not to encourage population but to discourage it; patterns of development had been designed accordingly.

For the West Indian newcomers, such a policy was hardly accommodating.  In  these  circumstances,  they  could  only  be  housed  in restricted areas. They had no choice. Of necessity then, they had to stay as close  to  the  central  London  labour  market  as  possible.  Coralled  into  bad housing,  these  migrants  lived  in  neglected  patches  of  London,  which  had been in the process of 'decline and social downgrading'.

The rooms they inhabited were in a state of decay. Nineteenth century basements, in an advanced stage of deterioriation, clumsy and ugly, became the homes of the migrants. Some accommodation near the Portobello Road and  Paddington  Station  were  'so  forbidding  that  they  were  a  mistaken speculation from the start; they were never, or only briefly occupied by the fairly prosperous families for whom they had been intended'. 7

In spite of these conditions, among the more enterprising West Indians necessity  brought  invention.  Many  applied  themselves  industriously  and soon  the  drab  surroundings  assumed  a  colourful  appearance.  But  for  all their  native  inventiveness  (apart  from  those  which  were  beyond  repair), some  lodgings  could  only  be  temporary  and  as  such,  presented  an  even more depressing prospect.

In the continued expansion of London's commercial centre, it was not unusual  to  see  both  decay  and  rejuvenation  existing  side  by  side.  Such contrasts  were  pronounced  in  North  Kensington  where  the  front  of  the buildings  indicated  that  migrants  might  be  living  there.  Moreover,  the condition of the streets and their surroundings revealed 'an important aspect of the so-called 'colour problem''.

Since  Charles  Booth's New Survey of London Life and Labour in  the 1920s,  there  had  been  a  rapid  deterioration  in  this  area  with  gaps  along streets of terraced housing. According to one observer, the 'missing house seemed to have fallen down'. These were the so-called 'streets of transition'

where  a  large  number  of  West  Indians  found  rooms.  Not  surprisingly bombed out sites formed part of the surroundings. At the periphery of one of these zones of transition are Notting Dale and Kensal New Town, which were in transition in the late nineteenth century. Since then they came to be called 'the rotten parts of the Royal Borough'. 8

These  districts  became  notorious  for  their  poverty,  overcrowding  and crime. In 1924 Kensal New Town presented a dismal picture as one of the worst districts in London. Social workers regarded bad housing in Southam Street  (with  its  nine-roomed  houses  in  which  2500  people  were  living  in 1923, an average of two persons in every room in the street) as surpassing the  Special  Area  of  Notting  Dale.  Some  rooms  were  described  as  'slum basements,  where  rheumatism  and  consumption  and  drink  scribble  their names  on  the  dirty wallpaper'. Not  surprisingly, this part of North Kensington figured weekly in the police news. 9

By  1951  Kensal  New  Town  had  the  highest  rate  of  overcrowding  in London, some five times greater than the average for the London area as a whole.  In  Golbourne  Ward  (which  includes  Kensal  New  Town)  12.7  per cent of the population were living at a density of more than two persons per room at the 1951 Census date. The comparable percentage of overcrowding for the whole area of North Kensington (consisting of four wards) was then 6.8 per cent; that for the borough of Kensington (North and South) 4.6 per cent; while that for the county of London was 2.5 per cent. 10

Growing immigration made the 'zones of transition' denser. Consequently,  housing  conditions  deteriorated  and  rents  increased.  West Indians lived in poor accommodation and paid high rents. Given their low incomes  there  was  no  alternative.  This  led  to  overcrowding.  Several migrants sharing one small room was not uncommon. In the limited living space, they slept, cooked and ate, staying indoors (except when the weather was warm) for most of their free time. Generally,  furniture  was  bare  and simple and washing facilities were shared with others. Under these cramped conditions, West Indians used to the open air, found their accommodation in London suffocating and hard to accept. In their rooms they felt 'home-sick'.

For  such  accommodation  as  they  had,  these  migrants  paid  a  standard rent  ranging  between  £2  to  £2.10 s .  and  £3  per  week.  The  West  Indian writer, Sam Selvon, living in London at the time, coined the phrase, 'a two and  ten  room'. 11 Within  this  rent-band  however,  there  were  a  number  of

variations upwards, never or rarely downwards.  Landlords exploited migrants  mercilessly.  Black  tenants  were  threatened  with  violence  to prevent  them  from  seeking  a  reduction  in  their  rent  from  a  rent  tribunal. These so-called 'shark' landlords plagued migrants exploiting their real and worst fears of homelessness. In spite of overcrowding (how ever unattractive  their  rooms)  many  West  Indians  kept  clean  houses  and  took pride in making their living quarters as comfortable as possible.

In  perspective,  it  was  clear  that  West  Indians  were  pushed  into  a decaying  environment  which  became  their  permanent  homes.  In  effect, prejudice and discrimination limited their opportunities for better accommodation. The migrants' complaints were, in time, echoed by many observers. Thus, the vicious circle became well-known: 'While high rents overcrowding and sharing are in part caused, and certainly accentuated by colour  prejudice,  such  conditions,  in  turn,  create  prejudice.  There  is  thus further deterioration, and more of the same.' This was a classic case with West Indians competing for scarce space and amenities with white tenants who  were  themselves,  for  a  long  time,  badly  housed.  Consequently, physical and social claustrophobia was attributed to the black newcomers. Dissatisfied Whites were hypersensitive. Accordingly, migrants were classified and an image of the black person was built up as an 'intruder' to be  blamed  for  the  frustrated  hopes  of  improvements.  But,  as The  Times reported: 'It is often said that working class white people resent an influx of coloured  neighbours  because  they  'lower'  the  district  with  their  crowded houses,  ignorant  behaviour,  and  rowdy  habits.  This  is  emphatically  not  a satisfactory explanation of the interracial resentment in North Kensington at the present.' 12

Nevertheless, a scapegoat was found and the witch-hunt proceeded. A few  weeks  later  in  July  1959,  the  Chief  Housing  Officer  for  Kensington said: 'Immigration into densely crowded  areas made  people  on  the [housing] waiting list suspicious and sensitive to the colour problem.' 13 The image was stronger where housing conditions were worse, for example in the  old  slums  on  the  periphery  of  the  'zones  of  transition'  or  in  adjacent streets  that  were  in  the  early  stages  of  transition.  Moreover,  noise  was synonymous  with  crowded  rooms.  Taken  together  then,  irritations  were infectious  and  hardship  was  cumulative.  Consequently,  the  disputes  were many  between  black  and  white  tenants  and  landlords.  Strained  relations

became an integral part of the migrant zones. Increasingly, Blacks turned to each other.

But how does a black landlord become one? The money for a house was often raised by a co-operative. Several migrants pooled their savings, thus raising  the  deposit.  Once  acquired,  the  rooms  in  the  house  were  let  to 'relations and  friends', to new  arrivals  and  to  'refugees'  from  other lodgings. Accumulated rent receipts went towards buying another house. In this  way,  a  chain  of  ownership  was  formed.  Naturally,  black  migrants tended to prefer black landlords to white, even though in some cases, the rents (a 'colour tax') charged were higher. White people on the other hand, (especially in North Kensington) blamed their increased rents on the West Indian  influx.  White  landlords  ready  to  exploit  the  new  comers,  bought property in the zones of transition for the specific purpose of 'rack-renting' black tenants who had few alternatives. Indeed, cases were known of such landlords  who  brought  in  West  Indian  tenants  and  encouraged  them  'to behave  in  an  anti-social  way  in  order  to  get  rid  of  sitting  tenants  so  that higher rents can be charged'. 14

Housing  migrants  then  involved  a  maze  of  exploitative  relationships. Within this, discrimination became increasingly pronounced. West Indians were apprehensive when they saw advertisements for vacant rooms such as 'coloured welcome' or 'coloured only'. And rightly so, for such exclusive welcome was not in their experience. They suspected that they could only be  welcomed  because  of  the  inflated  rents  they  would  have  to  pay. As  it was, these 'welcome' advertisements were rare. 'Anti-coloured' advertisements, more frequent, made the migrants even more conscious of their colour and oppressive discrimination.

Discriminatory advertisements seemed to confront them everywhere. A detailed count of the housing advertisements in the Kensington Post showed that in the 13 issues analysed (from 7 November 1958 to 30 January 1959) there  were  a  total  of  3876  advertisements  of  vacant  furnished  rooms  and flats.  Of  these,  1431  were  inserted  by  estate  agents,  most  of  which  were neutral; they said nothing about race, colour or nationality. Ten were 'procoloured' and eight were 'anti-coloured'. Most of the 2445 advertisements inserted by private householders or landlords were also neutral - 2061 were in that group. However, some 322 had an 'anti-coloured' tag; and 62 had a 'pro-coloured' one. The main kinds of 'anti-coloured' statements were nocoloured,  106;  Europeans  only,  142;  white  people  only,  25;  and  English

only,  49.  The  evidence  indicated  a  fairly  wide  range  of  discrimination, expressed crudely and, at times, apologetically.

Numerous as they were, the statistics  on  anti-coloured  advertisements did  not  indicate  the  amount  of  prejudice  which  West  Indian  migrants encountered.  There  were,  in  fact,  more  examples  of  the  kinds  of  overt discrimination  displayed  in  respectable  local  newspapers,  and  also  on  the notice boards at shop windows. It was clear that these published restrictions were  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  which  the  migrants  met  in  their search for lodgings. Most of the neutral advertisements without reference to colour, nationality or social class, were misleading in that most of the estate agents and landlords involved refused to accommodate Blacks. In the black experience, this was an established fact of everyday life. Discrimination in these advertisements was subtle. Landlords also resorted to the introduction of  a  colour  scheme  to  keep  black  men  away  from  calling  at  the  door,  or indeed, from inhabiting one of their shabby rooms.

In the  desperate  struggle  to  find  accommodation,  there  were  few operators  who  could  help  the  black  migrants.  One  manager  of  a  small agency near Piccadilly  Circus  which  did  find  accommodation  for  Blacks, but ceased to operate, said that he had as many as 200 West Indians a week asking for accommodation, but he had only been able to help about seven a week. Such was the magnitude of the problem. Increasingly Blacks were forced  to  rely on  members  of  their  own  exploited  groups.  A Times correspondent wrote: 'Even the most educated coloured people in London normally find flats or houses in London through friends. It is not unknown for  property  companies  to  put  a  stipulation  against  coloured  tenants,  or against foreigners, in leases.' 15 Xenophobia in housing was rampant. What is  more,  those  who  found  unskilled  and  semi-skilled,  low-paid  jobs  were faced with a truly major area of racial disadvantage. Indeed, black migrant labour was important in the designs of British capital.

## Employment

Unlike the situation in housing in which an overt colour bar was advertised, the recruitment of black migrant workers was more disguised. Nevertheless, racial discrimination and racial prejudice in employment were entrenched; the personnel officer was inclined to act in a most personal way. However, once a job was found, it brought about a 'new chain of frictions'.

The  English  workman  had  an  entirely  different  attitude  to  Blacks  as workmates  as  opposed  to  them  as  neighbours  or  prospective  neighbours. For while a white man was prepared to work with a black person, he was still reluctant to accept their living nearby. For 'he is far more likely to be aware  of  their  dark  skin  at  home  than  in  the  factory'. As  workers,  some white  men  were  not  reluctant  to  praise  the  migrants.  'Well,  definitely, there's some good working men amongst them … and I've got some good working men now.' 16  But, for others, the vast majority, the black man was shiftless and  lazy,  living  off  national  assistance  and  off  the  immoral earnings  of  prostitutes.  West  Indians  were  conscious  of  this  ambivalence among their white co-workers. While recognition of 'good working' might have  reduced  the  chance  of  discord  at  the  workplace,  it  certainly  did  not eliminate it where there were black workers. For the immigrant, getting a job was vital; after all he came to Britain essentially for economic reasons. Getting on with white workers was of secondary importance. Employment, and the attendant indignities in securing and enduring it, was therefore the hard  reality  for  the  mass  of  black  workers  who  were  joining  the  British workforce during this period.

In the field of employment, a large number of Barbadian migrants had received help either directly or indirectly from the official agency set up in London for the Barbadian government and for a few British industries. In the  rare  cases  where  migrants  secured  jobs  in  advance,  the  Barbadian government was prepared to lend the passage money. Under this government  scheme,  Barbadians  were  recruited  by  several  British  firms such as the British Transport Commission, the London Transport Executive and  the  British  Hotels  and  Restaurants  Association.  Domestic  work  in hospitals  was  catered  for  by  the  Regional  Hospital  Boards.  The  direct recruitment from Barbados in 1955 came at a time when there was a severe shortage of labour in the transport and catering industries. 17

The  prospect  of  large  numbers  of  black  workers  working  in  British industry  and  its  implications  for  race  relations,  did  not  go  unnoticed.  To avoid  the  black  problem,  the  British  Transport  Commission  proposed  the employment of Italians on the railways, but this was turned down by the National Union of Railway men. 18  Subsequently, the Transport Executive focused its recruiting efforts on Ireland and the Caribbean.

In spite of the economic urgency of the labour problem, much careful thinking had gone into the matter. The Executive had to consider its status as a nationalised industry as it related to the fact that as a mass employer of black workers it might be regarded as reflecting government policy. They need not have bothered, the British government had already reckoned up its labour requirements. Nevertheless, the Executive had previously employed Blacks but not many were in the operating grades. When the decision was taken  to  employ  them  in  these  grades  a  recruiting  team  was  sent  to Barbados in 1956. Thereafter, an elaborate organisation was set up on the island. Thus, via slavery and indentureship the black migrant, deliberately manipulated  by  British  industrial  policy,  came  from  the  bondage  of  the declining  sugar  monoculture  to  labour  in  the  metropolis,  the  centre  of  a declining Empire which now needed workers, not settlers.

The newcomers had travelled to London totally unaware of the realities awaiting them. By the end of 1958, London Transport had employed about 4000 black workers. 19  Some 3000 were recruited in London, while almost 1000  came  directly  from  Barbados.  After  receiving  two  extra  days  of training,  the  West  Indians  (like  other  newcomers  from  other  parts  of  the Commonwealth) started work in the lowest grades, hoping for promotion. By  1960  some  had  become  bus  drivers,  train  guards  and  booking  office clerks  and,  in  a  few  cases,  station  foremen.  Those  in  junior  supervisory posts were in charge of white and black workers, but they were only a token few.  West  Indian  workers  were  good  for  London  Transport  in  that  their turnover of staff was 'exceptionally low'. Thus, black labour was there to be exploited to the hilt and this was done regardless of the consequences.

The employment of migrants by London Transport was exceptional. In other  places  they  were  received  with  hesitation  or  treated  with  antipathy. The  employers'  views  of  black  workers  had  not  changed  fundamentally, although  they  continued  to  vary  marginally.  While  some  gave  good references to West Indian workers, others hesitated, describing them as slow and sloppy workers. The overlap of fact and fiction cannot be discounted, for  although  black  workers  were  not  classified  as  a  separate  group  of workers, colour was significant. Some firms kept an 'unofficial' tag.

The  diversity  of  the  migrants'  backgrounds  and  aspirations,  and  the diversity  of  the  attitudes  and  conditions  which  they  met  in  the  London labour  market,  reflected  a  wide  range  of  experiences.  The  few  success

stories  were  dampened  by  the  more  realistic  hardship  and  failures  of  the majority.

Another aspect of the newcomers' experience was occupational downgrading. In the light of the prejudices direoted against them, at least the outlines of the employment  situation  of  Blacks  were  clear.  The newcomers  found  a  variety  of  low-paid  jobs  in  London.  A  considerable number  were  in  nursing,  some  (male  and  female)  were  employed  as doctors, teachers, journalists or as black-coated workers. Others worked as skilled manual workers or in the field of entertainment. There were also a number  of  barbers,  tailors,  cleaners,  laundrymen,  shopkeepers  and  cafeowners whose establishments were largely patronised by West Indians.

Significantly,  only  a  few West  Indians,  however,  were  in  such  middle class and skilled positions. Most were employed in London as semi-skilled or unskilled labourers. In London the migrant was confronted with the real possibility of doing work which was of lower occupational prestige vis-àvis his  former  position  in  the  West  Indies.  Not  all  newcomers,  however, regretted their downgrading,  for there were  benefits. For some  this downgrading was involuntary, while it was voluntary for others. Financial compensation was the reward for such a change. For example, a man could earn  more  if  he  was  employed  as  a  semi-skilled  manual  worker  than  he could earn as a clerk. 20

Having  said  this,  there  were  many  West  Indians  who  had  to  accept inferior  positions  to  the  'white  collar'  and  skilled  occupations  which  they had  held  before.  In  effect,  this  was  a  step  downwards  to  the  very  lowest rank of the unskilled labourers. Bitter disappointment was the result during a period of adjustment which was long and very painful.

Another explanation for the downgrading experience of so many West Indians and other black workers, at the time, was the fact that they had to take  menial  jobs  because  of  colour  prejudice  and  discrimination.  While some observers agreed that this allegation was difficult to prove, they could not  deny  that  there  were  'colour  bars'  and  often  'colour  quotas'.  Clearly, colour  prejudice  was  a  major  factor  which,  given  the  intricate  web  of circumstances, more or less played its part.

## Newcomers and the trade unions

Paradoxically,  the  growing  grievances  of  black  workers  at  the  workplace, posed a challenge to the Trade Union Movement, and its belief in equality

and  brotherhood.  Indeed,  the  official  trade  union  policy  was  opposed  to discrimination.  This  was  unequivocally  emphasised  in  a  General  Council statement  submitted  at  the  Trades  Union  Congress  (held  soon  after  the disturbances  in  Nottingham  and  Notting  Hill)  in  September  1958,  which read:

The Trade Union Movement has been forthright in its condemnation of every manifestation of racial prejudice and discrimination in any part of the world. Here in Britain, immigrants from many countries have been freely accepted into membership of trade unions and in general have been integrated into industrial life. Satisfactory housing and social integration have been more difficult to achieve. Decent people will  appreciate  that  this  is  a  matter  which  calls  for understanding  and  that  many  immigrants  arrive  in  Britain  with  a limited  knowledge  of  its  social,  and  economic  environment  and pattern of life which is so different from their own, and which they require  to  accustom  themselves.  Here  is  the  field  in  which  joint efforts in local communities can do so much to further tolerance and an appreciation of the difficult problems which are involved. 21

Many  individual  unions  and  branches  submitted  similar  resolutions denouncing  discrimination.  Within  the  trade  union  movement,  however, there  was  a  disparity  of  views  reflected  in  the  approach  of  policy-makers and the attitudes at other levels. Sometimes the gap was very wide indeed. In  fact,  as  the  trade  union  'high  command'  passed  resolutions  deploring colour prejudice, some local branches operated colour quotas. Furthermore, there  was  no  united  approach  on  the  colour  question  among  the  local branches of any one trade union. The  ambiguity  within the labour movement was reflected in this resolution:

The  coloured  people  coming  to  England  are  British  subjects  only seeking a means of existence which is denied them in their place of birth. We implore all trade unionists to do all in their power to help them obtain employment and join their respective trade unions, thus enabling them to work and live as decent human beings.

It  is  time  a  stop  was  put  to  all  foreign  labour  entering  this country: they constitute a danger to the workers of this country. In

the event of a slump occurring, the market would be flooded with cheap foreign labour and a serious deterrent to trade union bargaining power. 22

Here then we see trade unionists asking black workers to join the trade unions but also calling for a ban on black immigration to Britain. Did they not  know  of  the  labour  shortage  in  the  British  economy  (which  was  the issue) rather than the hypothetical, 'In the event of a slump occurring the market  would  be  flooded  with  cheap  foreign  labour'?  This  was  a  thin disguise  for  their  own  colour  prejudice.  In  fact,  black  workers  proved  no serious deterrent to trade union bargaining power. It had been argued that the  attitudes  of  white  workers  and  trade  union  branches  to  the  'colour problem'  was  most  pronounced  in  the  Midlands  and  in  the  North  where memories  of  the  depression  were  still  vivid  and  where  xenophobia  was strong.  They  feared  that  black  workers  would  cut  overtime  earnings  and weaken  agreements,  that  employers  would  use  them  as  a  pool  of  cheap, sweated labour and in the event of strikes, use them as 'blacklegs'. This had been,  and  would  become  a  recurrent  sequence  in  the  white  workers' argument  against  Blacks.  This  time-worn  traditional  British  prejudice towards  the  foreigner  was  real;  it  was  rooted  in  the  fear  of  economic competition and the racist legacy of imperialism and colonialism.

In London, the geographical contrast in attitudes towards the recruitment  of  Blacks  was  highlighted  in  the  public  transport  services. While  in  London  there  were  few  initial  difficulties  when  Blacks  joined London Transport, in several provincial cities, there were unofficial strikes or  threats  of  strikes  when  Indians,  Pakistanis  and  West  Indians  were recruited  for  the  buses.  To  influence  attitudes  towards  black  workers, members of the Birmingham Transport Authority told a BBC interviewer:

We did  face  the  difficulty  that  a  number  of  staff  thought  that  we should  get  so  many  coloured  and  that  they  would  cause  trouble between the black and white … I am pleased to say that we've got positive  proof  in  our  everyday  working  that  those  fears  were  very largely unfounded.  …  And  although  on  the  Birmingham  City Transport at the moment we've got probably more [coloured] people than any  other undertaking  of a similar kind in the country anywhere, we can say with some degree of pride that they are now

working with the white crews, working with the white public, and I think we can almost say that very often they're not even noticed; no one is conscious that it's a coloured driver or a coloured conductor. 23

In  spite  of  these  assurances,  seemingly  'tolerant'  people,  among  them trade unionists, supported discrimination.

During the 1950s relations between Blacks and Whites were distinctly uneasy. There  were  many  cases  of  disharmony  at  the  workplace.  Outside London,  two  in  particular  took  place  in  the  Midland  towns  of  West Bromwich and Wolverhampton in 1955 involving Asian workers. The first dispute  occurred  in  February  1955  when  workers  at  the  West  Bromwich Corporation Transport system started a series of token Saturday strikes in protest against the employment of an Indian trainee conductor. The strikers said the strikes would continue until agreement was reached with management  on  the  question  of  'coloured  labour'.  Paradoxically,  the official  union  policy  was  opposed  to  discrimination  on  the  grounds  of colour,  while  the  management  intended  to  recruit  any  suitable  person regardless of colour.

The strike had aroused much local interest. The Bishops of Birmingham and Lichfield intervened asking the strikers to reconsider their action. They argued that enforcing a colour bar was not reconcilable with Christianity. 24

The General Secretary of the strikers' union (TGWU), Arthur Deakin, argued that the strike was not a question of colour prejudice but rather that the men were conditioned by a fear of unemployment. 25  Be that as it may, the  fact  remains  that  the  Indian  trainees  were  not  white  but  black  and 'foreign'.  Would  they  have  reacted  the  same  way,  had  the  trainees  been white?

In  the  dispute  at  Wolverhampton  which  occurred  a  few  months  later, transport  workers  in  the  Corporation  decided  to  ban  all  overtime  from  1 September in protest against the increase of black recruits. In defence of its action, the Union branch secretary said: 'We are not operating a colour bar. The men have made friends with the coloured men on the job, but we don't intend  to  have  the  platform  staff  made  up  to  its  full  strength  by  coloured people only.' 26

There were 68 black workers employed among a total of over 900. This was  clearly  well  above  the  colour  quota.  The  branch  secretary  said  the union was prepared to accept 52 blacks but the Transport Committee of the Corporation denied giving such a promise.

When the overtime ban ended on 18 September, the men wanted a 5 per cent quota of 'coloured labour' and demanded that there be no recruitment of  Blacks  while  negotiations  were  in  progress.  The  Transport  Committee refused these requests. They argued that if, in fact, the men were not asking for  a  colour  bar,  then  their  opposition  was  simply  an  attempt  to  keep  the department  short-staffed,  thus  maintaining  overtime  earnings.  In  the  end, the men dropped their demand for a 5 per cent quota and a panel was set up to 'consider all recruits'. 27 In this dispute, as in the first, the official union policy was opposed to colour discrimination. This was difficult to accept, when they were in fact practising it.

## Relations between black and white workers

Given this background, relations between white and black workmates, put simply, were strained. One observer concluded that race relations in British industry  were  full  of  ambiguities  and  contradictions.  While  some  white workers opposed the employment of black workers, others protested against the  dismissal  of  black  workers.  These  conflicting  attitudes  contributed substantially to the insecurity of the black migrant's position.

As  black  immigration  to  Britain  proceeded,  white  workers  began  to distinguish between different kinds of immigrants, shifting from the general to the specific. Serious  difficulties  remained  for  some  migrants.  The problems for West Indians, for example, were not so acute as for migrants from  India,  Pakistan  and  Africa.  One  writer  stated  that  the  difference between the previous and the new environment was not so radical for the West Indians as it was for many of the others. By and large the men from the Caribbean territories were already more conditioned for life and work in England than those from Asia and Africa. And, most importantly, they had no major language problem. It was argued that the direct cause of industrial disputes about black people had been more often the employment of Indians and Pakistanis than that of West Indians. This was seen as a reflection of the special problems which the Asian migrants had because of their language difficulties.  While  West  Indians  did  not  speak  'local'  English,  and  their distinct accents  and  phrases  occasionally  caused  misunderstanding  or

mutual  irritation,  there  was  no  greater  barrier  to  communication.  Minor differences in speech and habits however were often even more annoying to both sides than major ones particularly when mutual strangeness was taken for granted. 28

A source of irritation and resentment on the part of English workers was the fact that West Indians, on the whole, in spite of their familiarity with the English  language,  were  not  familiar  with  trade  union  organisation.  The main reason for the West Indian's attitude was the fact that the trade unions in the West Indies were new and 'seditious' organisations. The newcomer to Britain  was  therefore  hesitant  to  apply  for  union  membership.  In  fact,  he was  sometimes  unable  to  do  so  because  he  lacked  the  qualifications necessary to be accepted by a craft union which he wanted to join because of his previous skilled occupation. On the other hand, many West Indians participated in trade union activities in London and the provinces. Some of these activists became shop stewards and a few were elected as secretaries of union branches which questioned the views of white workers about black participation in trade unions.

Moreover,  in  the  relations  between  black  workers  and  white  at  the workplace,  external  factors  played  a  part.  The  West  Indian's  prowess  at sport - cricket, for example - made him well-known and respected by his workmates with an interest in cricket. In much the same way, the folklore of the black man's sexual prowess enters into reactions at the workplace. The tangle  of  sexual  images  about  the  black  man,  and  of  sexual  competition with  him,  was  invariably  transferred  to  the  workplace,  thus  affecting adversely the working relationship.

The Senior and Manley Report of 1955 stated that white workers were much more reluctant to accept black workers in establishments where both men  and  women  were  employed  than  in  those  which  only  men  were working. The Report also said that white workers were more likely to object to  'coloured'  workers  in  job  situations  'where  they  might  be  thrown  into contact with white women' than in others. 29

As late as 1959 the employment of black shop assistants was rare. In fact when one was employed, it was of such outstanding importance that it featured  on  the  front  page  of  the West  Indian Gazette . 30 Colour  was  a crucial factor in employment. Both employers and unions often demanded a

'colour quota'. In view of this their actions were far less noticeable. Thus, the colour quota remained a significant issue among employers.

Given the 'colour quota' and 'colour bar', the galling fact was that the conduct  and  performance  of  black  workers  were  heavily  criticised  quite often  by  firms  which  had  no  experience  (or  very  little)  of  employing Blacks.  In  the  preliminary  unpublished  survey  'On  Integration  of  the Coloured Population of Willesden' some 20 managers of large firms, each employing over 200 workers, were questioned. It was found that among the employers  questioned  all  reported  that  they  had  no  serious  difficulties  in employing  black  workers  from  the  point  of  view  of  racial  relationships. However, management policy on questions of racial intolerance appeared to differ considerably as between one organisation and another. One firm, for instance, had in the past dismissed both black and white workers who had been involved in 'some kind of conflict', and seemed to think that this had not  only  effectively  prevented  any  further  trouble  but  had,  in  their  view, helped  to  improve  relationships  in  the  factory.  Other  firms  were  less confident in their outlook and seemed more susceptible to the complaints of white workers if merited, while others used black labour wholly or mainly on  unskilled  work,  since  they  believed  that  this  seemed  to  placate,  or  to avoid trouble with their white workers. 31

The black worker was always reminded that it was the colour of his skin which exposed him to the prejudices of white workers and employers. This increased the stresses and strains of life which they bore. The contradictions among employers were many. It would seem in given circumstances that they suited themselves. Some said the migrants were not very robust, while others felt they were 'tough'; that some lacked initiative while others were 'ambitious and self-reliant'; that black people were 'slow and lazy' and that they 'work hard and quickly'; that they were 'lethargic' and 'energetic', that they 'cannot adapt themselves' and that they were 'remarkably adaptable'.

Without denying the diverse experiences that a few employers had of black workers, their generalisations revealed more about their own attitudes to  colour  than  about  the  characteristics  of  the  migrants  from  the  West Indies, Africa and Asia.

Overall,  the  adjustment  of  the  migrants  in  the  local  communities  in which  they  concentrated,  and  the  process  of  integration  at  the  workplace presented  the  black  worker  with  innumerable  difficulties,  most  of  which arose  from  the  reactions  of  white  officials,  workers,  trade  unions  and

employers.  Moreover,  since  a  considerable  number  of  West  Indians  who migrated did not belong to the lowest ranks in their society, many of them had never thought of themselves as members of the working class before they arrived in Britain. As it was, men who were employers in Port of Spain had become factory-hands in London; women who had their own servants had become kitchen maids.

Very  quickly  then,  the  migrants  became  disillusioned  with  the  preimmigration  rosy  images  and  notions  of  the  British.  Their  dreams  of economic betterment were shattered in the face of the British stereotyping of black people. Of necessity, and partly because of an innate West Indian characteristic of 'flexibility', the newcomers adapted to the 'new images' of the British, offering resistance all along the way. Although stereotypes on both sides made for an uneasy rapprochement , mutual strangeness was only gradually modified by personal experience. Where  stereotyping was maintained, suspicions became more rigid, thus increasing the difficulties of communication between black and white people.

During the decade of the 1950s, colour prejudice, whether ambiguous, concealed or open, led to discrimination primarily in housing and jobs and tended to be self-perpetuating. This had disastrous effects on the lives of the newcomers  to  Britain.  Yet,  no  serious  consideration  was  given  to  the growing tension that had already accumulated.

## The riots of 1958

## Nottingham

In 1958 an estimated 2000 to 3000 black people were living in Nottingham. A  considerable  number  were  concentrated  in  a  'decaying'  district.  It  was here in The Chase (a public house) on Saturday 23 August 1958 that a fight took  place  between  two  men,  one  black,  the  other  white,  before  closing time. The fighting spread quickly. Several men were stabbed. The attacks led to counterattacks. Dozens of men and women were injured. Reinforcements  were  called  in  to  aid  the  two  or  three  policemen  in pacifying a 1500 hostile crowd which had gathered. The fire brigade was also called in for fear that the 'ugly riotous crowd' would have started fires. And, as was the case in Cardiff in 1919, several black men with cuts and bruises were taken away by police 'for their own safety'. Some 90 minutes

later,  order  was restored and by midnight the crowds were dispersed. The events of this night were not a case of 'spontaneous combustion'. Tension in  the  area  had  been  running  high  for  a  long  time  as  black  people  were molested,  humiliated  and  beaten  up  by  'Teddy  Boys'.  There  were  many cases of violence committed by Whites against Blacks, two weeks before the  Saturday  night  brawls.  The  police  had  been  aware  of  this,  for  they regarded the Saturday night fights as a reprisal for earlier attacks on Blacks. The Assistant Chief Constable of Nottingham confirmed that there had been assaults. He said that two white men were on remand charged with robbery with violence against a coloured man and that the attacks made by 'Teddy Boys'  in  the  previous  15  days  were  responsible  for  the  Saturday  night outbursts.  He  regarded  the  black  community,  apart  from  a  few  isolated cases, as being 'very well behaved'. 32

The disturbances were given wide press coverage. The Times reported that the race clash in Nottingham was alarming. 33 Other national newspapers, less optimistic and less restrained, told the Teddy Boys' story in a distorted form.

It seems clear then that before the fighting broke out, relations between Blacks and Whites in The Chase were tense. And after the fighting more trouble was expected the following Saturday. A large crowd of Teddy Boys and local white people, sightseers and reporters, had assembled where the trouble had taken place the previous Saturday. There were no black people in  the  crowd;  they  were  advised  to  remain  indoors,  while  police  patrols moved the crowd along. In a mood of expectancy, the 'milling mob' had grown to about 4000 during the course of the evening. No black person was in  sight  until,  presumably  unaware  of  the  crowd,  a  car  with  three  West Indians passing through the area was stopped. The crowd went wild. Cries of  'let's  lynch  them',  'Let's  get  at  them',  went  up  as  the  crowd,  many  of them Teddy Boys, poured from public houses and tried to smash their way into the car. Beating on the windows, they tried to overturn it. Finally the police forced a path through them and told the black men in the car to 'go like hell'. They did. 34

After the West Indians had escaped, with the crowd in 'lynching mood', tension remained high; it seemed inevitable there had to be some release. According  to  one  report,  the  trouble  started  when  a  cameraman  lit  a magnesium flare to 'film a scuffle between a small party of youths'. At that

moment,  the  dispersing  crowd  rushed  back,  anticipating  a  fire.  In  the commotion, there was 'great agitation' and shouting. The call was to 'find some niggers'. With no black people in the streets, Whites fought against Whites and the police. Over 50 people were arrested and 24 teenagers and men  were  charged  under  the  Public  Order  Act.  The  next  day  the  Chief Constable said: 'This was not a racial riot. The coloured people behaved in an exemplary way by keeping out of the way. Indeed they were an example to  some  of  the  rougher  elements.  The  people  primarily  concerned  were irresponsible teddy boys and persons who had had a lot to drink.' 35

But,  was  the  violence  attributable  simply  to  drink?  Among  those sentenced  to  three  months'  imprisonment  each,  were  the  'nigger-chasing' men aged between 24 and 45 years. Two Saturdays after the initial trouble, a crowd had again assembled. In the ensuing 'nigger-baiting' incidents, the homes of some black people were besieged. In defence, tenants threw milk bottles from the upper floors while the mob below attacked the houses with a  hail  of  bricks  and  bottles.  In  a  dark  street,  the  mob  chased  black  men assaulting  five  of  them.  The  violence  was  stopped  when  the  police  vans arrived.

Once  again,  colour  prejudice  had  reared  its  head.  Nottingham  was marked by it and, for various reasons, many would not forget it. But even the seriousness of the violence had a ghoulish side. A bus company trying to capitalise on the misfortune of black people, advertised coach tours to see the 'terror spots' of Nottingham. The Sheriff of Nottingham was horrified by  this  latest  development.  He  said:  'It  comes  at  a  time  when  we  are striving to eliminate racial conflict. I understand that chalked notices have been displayed outside  bus  garage  booking  offices  in  Leicester  …  giving full details of the trips. More disturbing, however, was the rumour that the same thing is being done in other cities and towns.'

The police were asked to request that the trips be withdrawn. 36

## The London riots

More serious than the 'riots' in Nottingham was the simultaneous violence in London. Unlike the Nottingham troubles, the riots in London continued uninterruptedly  for  several  days  and  were  also  spread  over  a  wider  area. The  trouble  started  in  Shepherds  Bush  and  adjacent  Notting  Dale  and spread to several areas in Notting Hill, Kensal New Town, Paddington and Maida Vale. The London riots also differed from the Nottingham experience

in  that  it  did  not  occur  in  the  centre  of  a  district  with  a  dense  black population. Indeed, the main explosions occurred outside the black settlements, and the worst offenders were from white housing estates and districts.

While,  as  in  Nottingham,  the  large-scale  London  disturbances  were preceded  by  a  number  of  'sporadic  assaults'  on  black  people,  in  London there  was  no  retaliation  by  black  men  which  started  the  crowd  outbursts, nor was there a definite chain of incidents during the turbulent days. There was no set pattern. As 'nigger hunting' spread, a growing number of people, 'active forces and passive spectators', became involved in several districts. Overall,  an  atmosphere  of  'menace  and  fear'  pervaded  the  area.  Between July  and  early August  1958,  apart  from  fights  between  individuals,  there were many attacks by gangs of white youths on black people.

Shortly after the disturbances in Nottingham,  on  23  August,  the heightened tension had brought about aggression in several places in West London.  Black  people  had  had  the  ugly  experience  of  'one  weekend  of sport' - attempts by drivers of taxi cabs to run them down after nightfall. Fear of this among black people was real. White attitudes were, at the time, reflected  in  such  fascist  slogans  as  'Keep  Britain  White'  and  'People  of Kensington Act Now'. Furthermore, fascist agitators stirred up the racists in and around Notting Hill, where the White Defence League and the Union Movement held meetings and distributed  leaflets.  In  these  circumstances, the racists were poised for violent attacks on black people.

On  Saturday  evening  (23 August)  the  homes  of  several  black  people were attacked and in the small hours of Sunday morning, nine white youths from Shepherds Bush cruised along their and the adjacent districts in a car, intent  on  'nigger  hunting'.  Their  armoury  consisted  of  iron  bars,  starting handles, table legs, pieces of wood and a knife. Their strategy was to attack black persons walking alone, or at most two. After their attacks, five black men  (three  of  them  seriously  injured)  were  admitted  to  hospital.  One  of them,  with  a  chest  wound,  was  taken  into  the  Magistrate's  Court  on  a stretcher  to  give  evidence,  but  was  not  allowed  to  do  so.  The  magistrate said,  'I  have  never  before  seen  a  man  in  that  state  brought  into  a  court.  I don't think he is fit to give evidence.' 37

The case became notorious for its 'nigger-hunting' youths. Later, they were  tried  at  the  Old  Bailey  and  sentenced  to  four  years'  imprisonment each.

Although the Manchester Guardian noted, 'Other Cities Not Perturbed About  Nottingham  It  Could  Happen  Here  Feeling', 38   a  few  days  later, violence did break out, this time on a much larger scale. As previously, the trouble occurred on Bramley Road and the vicinity of Notting Dale, where few black people lived. In the attack on several houses, one was set on fire. An  aggressive  crowd  of  some  200  milled  about  the  streets.  As  fighting broke out, a variety of weapons including iron bars were used. 39 The next day in Bramley Road between 400 and 700 people had gathered. Feelings ran high. The furious fighting was punctuated with the shouts 'We will kill the  blacks  …'  and  'We  will  get  the  blacks'.  This  'lynch  mob'  exchanged blows with black people and the police. In the affray several people were admitted to hospital with injuries and two police cars were damaged. The disturbances had spread to several other places. Under the railway arches near Latimer Road Underground Station a gang of 100 youths with sticks, iron bars and knives, had gathered. 40 There were fights also on the Harrow Road and in Kensal Rise. The rioting continued day and night. Most black people  stayed  at  home.  They  fought  back  as  the  attack  on  their  homes intensified.  By  Monday  and  Tuesday,  1  and  2  September  the  riot  had reached its peak; it had become continuous and widespread.

Thereafter, it ran its course for several days, with 'sporadic outbursts' until  mid-September  in  Notting  Hill,  Notting  Dale  and  Paddington.  By September then, the public was reading sensational headlines in the press. At  the  height  of  the  riots  the  dramatic  impact  of  individual  experiences were  reported. 41 There  were  also  reports  of  incidents  throughout  the affected  areas. According  to The  Times 'a  crowd  of  youths  went  through Oxford  Gardens  …  smashing  windows  in  houses  where  coloured  people live.  'They  didn't  miss  a  house',  said  one  white  resident  …  A  police official  said  earlier:  'There  are  thousands  of  people  milling  around  the Notting Hill area … a black couple took to their heels pursued by the crowd crying 'Let's get the blacks''.' 42

The British public was now fully informed of the drama of Notting Hill. Some initiative had to be taken. George Rogers, MP for North Kensington, appealed  for  common  sense,  decency  and  tolerance  in  race  relations  and asked the people to 'remain calm, to stay indoors in your homes tonight, and to obey the police'. Rogers carried this message on his tour of the area. There was also a 'nigger-hunting' tour undertaken by five white men in a

car  who  drove  around  shouting,  'Stir  them  up'. 43 And  later  that  day,  the Union  Movement  maintained  its  presence  outside the Latimer Road Underground Station. The Movement was active in the district. In fact, on 4 September,  one  of  their  members  was  arrested  for  insulting  behaviour  in Ladbroke Grove, while distributing pamphlets.

Although some black people were militant during this period, most of them  obeyed  the  police  and  stayed  indoors.  But,  this  could  not  last,  for some had to face the public at their peril. Black bus conductors who lived in the  troubled  area  were  given  police  escort  at  the  end  of  their  journeys. Moreover,  black  people  were  subjected  to  vicious  taunts  from  the  racists who  hawked Action (the  Union  Movement  paper)  and  youths  chanting 'Down with the niggers',  'Deport  all  niggers'.  Others  adopted  the  motto: 'Keep Britain White'. 44

On 2 September, when Scotland Yard announced that the Metropolitan police 'will continue to carry out their duty to preserve the Queen's peace without fear, favour or discrimination', at least 55 people were arrested. In spite of the hope that a change in the hot weather would 'damp the trouble', when rain did fall on 3 September, 'after four of the most turbulent days that London had seen for a long time', its effect was to disperse the crowds. It  did  not  'damp  the  trouble'  which  became  'more  localised'. 45 The  next day, hot and tense again, saw the continuation (though on a restricted scale) of petrol bombs being flung into the homes of black people in Notting Hill and  Paddington.  The  anti-nigger  shouts  and  bottle-throwing  had  by  then become commonplace.

News  of  the  riots  travelled  fast.  On  5  September,  two  West  Indian political leaders, Norman Manley, Chief Minister of Jamaica, and Dr Carl LaCorbiniere, the Deputy Prime Minister in the Federal Government of the West Indies, arrived in London. Dr Hugh Cummins, the Prime Minister of Barbados,  followed  them.  They  had  talks  with  the  British  government, addressed meetings of their fellow countrymen in London and visited the troubled  areas  in  London  and  Nottingham. 46 As  fear  decreased,  black people ventured on the streets again. Unfortunately, occasional attacks on black people and their properties in the affected districts and elsewhere in Greater London continued.

On  15  September,  when  the  riots  died  down,  Justice  Salmon  gave judgement on the nine 'nigger-hunting' youths; this 'severe' sentence was

controversial.

Fenner Brockway, having asked the Home Secretary to recommend the exercise  of  the  Royal  Prerogative  to  reduce  the  sentences  said:  'These youths were as much the victims of the hysteria which swept over Notting Hill as the West Indians.' 47 The whole concept of punishment came under review with strong comments from all quarters. The fascist papers referred to  Justice  Salmon  as  that  Jewish  Judge'  who,  according  to  one  report, received a threatening letter.

The youths appealed unsuccessfully. Their local MP raised the question in  the  House  of  Commons  in  February  1960.  He  asked  that  'further consideration  …  be  given  to  a  reduction  in  these  sentences  if  it  is  not possible to quash them altogether'. Although he received support from both sides of the House, the government spokesman replied that he was 'unable to  indicate  a  prospect  that  the  Home  Secretary  will  find  it  possible  to recommend any revision of the sentences which the Court considered right and which were upheld on appeal'. 48

It was hoped the sentence would have a deterrent-effect, which it did for a time. However, in the uneasy truce that ensued, Justice Salmon's words to the charged youths were appropriate:

It  was  you  men  who  started  the  whole  of  this  violence  in  Notting Hill.  You  are  a  minute  and  insignificant  section  of  the  population who have brought shame upon the district in which you lived, and have filled the whole nation with horror, indignation and disgust. I am determined that you and anyone anywhere who may be tempted to follow your example shall clearly understand that crimes such as this will not be tolerated in this country, but will inevitably meet in these courts with the stern punishment  which  they  so justly deserve. 49

In the aftermath of the disorders, the process of identifying the causes began,  and  blame  was  allocated  accordingly.  While  there  was  general agreement  that  a  small  group  of  Teddy  Boys  were  responsible  for  the troubles in Nottingham and Notting Hill, some sections of the press were blamed for 'sensational treatment' of the news which had a snowball effect. There was also the influence of fascist agitators, particularly in Notting Hill. And according to an American columnist in the New York Herald Tribune ,

the disturbances in Nottingham and London were the result of a Communist conspiracy  of  the  same  kind  that  had  accentuated  racial  conflict  in  Little Rock  and  fomented  riots  in  the  southern  United  States.  In  response,  the Manchester Guardian reported that this theory had not occurred even to the most 'Right minded commentators in Fleet Street'. 50

But while all these explanations had relevance, at the heart of the matter was  'the  colour  problem'.  The  number  of  black  migrants,  it  was  argued, determined  the  'quantity  of  friction',  since  there  would  be  no  friction  if there  were  no  Blacks  in  Britain. As  the  debate  gathered  momentum,  and comparison was made with the American experience, it became clear that there  was  no  one  simple  or  single  explanation  as  to  the  causes  of  the disorders. It was clear, however, that, 'The trouble makers of Notting Hill acted  out  tendencies  which  were  latent  in  all  social  strata.  They  were shouting  what  others  were  whispering.'  That  was  the  lesson  of  the  1958 race riots which revealed not two but several nations which were separated from  each  other.  Furthermore,  both  the  riots  and  the  comments  on  them clearly revealed the British ambivalence on the question of colour. The riots also proved that in such a situation the aggressive fringe groups were not insignificant. 51

If government practices and policies had brought about inner city decay and the advent of black immigration, was there a political solution? What were the reactions of responsible officials to the 'race riots'?

## Reactions: prelude to control

The  'colour  problem'  in  Britain  had  become  world-wide  news.  The  first effect, following the riots in August-September 1958, was a flood of reports and comments. This reaction revealed the thinking of official institutions. The  press  unanimously  censured  the  'hooligans  of  Notting  Hill'  and The Times pontificated on 'A Family of Nations'. Race relations was hot news not only in the media but at local and national conferences. Political parties and trade unions felt bound to state their views on black and white people.

But there were voices elsewhere. The British Council of Churches and many ministers denounced the 'dastardly attacks'. Moreover, a host of new organisations were formed and specially prepared pamphlets and memoranda were issued by the Labour Party, the Fabian Society, the Bow

Group,  the  Conservative  Commonwealth  Council  and  Oswald  Mosley's Union  Movement.  The  Labour  Party  stated:  'The  Labour  Party  utterly abhors every manifestation of racial prejudice, and particularly  condemns those  instances  which  have  recently  occurred  in  this  country. 52 The  Bow Group feared comparison with the foreign reputation of the United States as a  result  of  Little  Rock,  while  the  Conservative  Commonwealth  Council warned, 'We cannot retain the integrity or the cohesion of the Commonwealth unless we can solve and eradicate colour prejudice here in Britain.' 53

Apart from some extreme groups, the opinion leaders were agreed that 'racial  discrimination  is  unBritish'.  These  were  the  terms  of  reference within which  further discussion would  follow, at least for a while. Aggressive  racial  prejudice  was  a  fact  in  Britain.  This  startled  some, arousing 'shame and anger'.

During the late 1950s the question of colour was already an internationally sensitive issue, featuring in the daily news from Africa, Asia, the West Indies and  America. Indeed it was of particular political importance to the changing British Commonwealth. Comparisons between Little Rock and Notting Hill caused great concern not only in Britain, but in the United States of America. The American newspapers in the North and South,  gave  prominence  to  the  race  riots  in  Britain.  In  fact,  in  the  deep South,  it was  thought  that  Notting  Hill  had  become  an  'outpost  of Alabama'.

In Britain, white commentators generally sought a balanced appraisal of the  'riots'. George  Rogers,  Labour  MP  for  North  Kensington  (which includes Notting Hill and Notting Dale) said, '… it was wrong to say this trouble had been started by hooligans. It was the reaction of people sorely tried by some sections of the coloured population.' 54

In  the  continuing  debate,  there  emerged  a  polarisation  of  opinion.  On the  one  hand,  there  were  those  who  saw  racial  tension  as  a  British responsibility which required new measures to counteract it, for example, more training  for  low  income  groups,  improved  education  for  citizenship and  legislation  against  racial  discrimination,  among  others.  On  the  other hand, there were  those  who  argued  that  being  essentially a 'colour problem', it was aggravated by the growth of a black immigrant minority which was undesirable. Thus, they demanded  the control of black

immigration  to  Britain  and  that  Commonwealth  migrants  convicted  for criminal offences should be deported.

Among policy makers, the control of Commonwealth immigration was nothing new. It had been debated in the House of Commons before the riots on  3  April  1958.  In  essence,  the  discussion  was  centred  on  'coloured Immigrants'. Speaking for the government Miss Hornsby Smith said:

We cannot ignore the rising potential of this immigration. In view of the size of the populations of the countries from which these people are coming, we have to take stock of the position as it now presents itself, and to realise that it could in the future possibly constitute a very grave burden on this country if the trend were to increase, or if the numbers  arriving  in  this country  were  to  become  out  of proportion to those that the country can reasonably absorb.

She cited rates of employment, sickness and crime among black people in Britain, and argued that 'Although the coloured immigrants are not, on the whole being assimilated into the country', generally, they did not create any 'special' employment, health and police problems. However, there had been discussions with the governments of India and Pakistan to discourage 'unsuitable  immigrants'  and  the  British  government  was  reluctant  'to receive  all  citizens'  who  had  the  status  of  British  subject. 55 Given  these arguments,  India  and  Pakistan  imposed  stricter  control  on  immigration  to Britain.

After  the  Nottingham  disturbances,  two  local  MPs  asked  for  control. Their demand drew sharp criticism from the Manchester Guardian which deplored the fact that they 'should have spoken as though the entire onus rested on the coloured community and talked of restricting immigration to this country as if this might be the prime remedy'. 56 The views of these two MPs, however, received considerable support which was reinforced by the Notting  Hill  riots.  Other  MPs  joined  in  the  chorus  for  an  immigration 'quota'. Together they exerted enough pressure to get a response from the government. 57

Since  the  demand  for  restrictions  referred  not  to  the  immigrants  who were white but to those who were black, immigration control was a polite term for a colour bar. All sorts of measures were being considered to lessen their  numbers in Britain and to keep black people out of Britain. Enough

had  been  said  and  done  towards  the  expression  of  strong  views  by  those who felt the time was right. The Conservative Party Conference in October 1958 resolved to revise the immigration laws 'irrespective of race, colour or creed',  and  the  feeling  was  that  immigrants  convicted  of  serious  criminal offences should be deported. 58

Debating immigration control early in December 1958, the government spokesman concluded: 'Both the Government and, I am glad to record, the opposition Front Bench do not see the necessity for any general control of immigration. The Government are considering very carefully the possibility of legislation to deport criminals but, as I have pointed out, that gives rise to great complexities.' 59

At this stage, it seemed the government's position was to leave 'control' and to concentrate on the deportation of 'undesirable' black people.

The  Conservatives  were  not  the  only  politicians  preoccupied  with immigration control. In fact, the question cut across party lines. There was mixed reaction in each of the parties. The  Labour  Party,  however,  took  a stand: 'We are firmly convinced that any form of British legislation limiting Commonwealth  immigration  to  this  country  would  be  disastrous  to  our status in the Commonwealth and to the confidence of the Commonwealth peoples.' 60

The  Liberal  Party  denounced  racial  discrimination  and  rejected  any restriction of immigration. Even the liberal wing of the Conservatives, the Conservative  Commonwealth  Council,  said  it  would  be  wrong  to  'deny Commonwealth citizens their traditional right to come to Britain [for] if we were  to  legislate  against  colour  we  would  in  the  end  bring  about  the disintegration of the Commonwealth'. 61  But the forces of disintegration had already  been  set  in  motion,  moving  irrevocably  forward.  The  idea  of restrictive legislation was shelved for the time being. Instead, it was decided to  explore  the  possibility  of  informal  agreements  with  Commonwealth countries, since their co-operation was necessary in reducing the numbers. Ultimately,  however,  the  British  government  reserved  its  rights. As  Lord Elton put it, 'We should not seek to exclude, but rather should wish to be able to exercise some power of selection and regulation. And in that way we should not be exposing ourselves to the invidious and everdreaded charge of colour prejudice. …' 62

The possibility of introducing legislation during the late 1940s and early 1950s  to  make  discrimination  a  punishable  offence  was  debated.  Before 1960, no government was prepared to do so. Three main arguments were put forward against it. Firstly, it was unnecessary. It was argued that some of  the  sanctions  implicit  in  existing  common  and  criminal  law  were adequate.  For  example,  in  November  1949  the  Attorney  General  of  the Labour  government,  Sir  Hartley  Shawcross,  felt  it  was  unnecessary  to legislate  against  restrictive  covenants  in  leases  which  exclude  coloured tenants.  He  thought  such  covenants  'may  well  be  void  under  the  existing law  as  being  contrary  to  the  rules  of  public  policy  upheld  by  English Courts'. 63 Secondly,  discrimination  was  not  a  fit  subject  for  legislation because it was difficult to draft an Act, defining the offences, and to enforce it,  without  interfering  with  certain  common  law  privileges  of  individual freedom. And thirdly, and most importantly, discrimination could only be eradicated  through  the  influence  of  'enlightened  public  opinion',  not through the law.

After the 'riots', these arguments were weakened. And as the group of black  immigrants  increased,  there  were  frequent  complaints  of  'colour bars'.  By  the  autumn  of  1958  then,  with  a  growing  body  of  'enlightened public  opinion'  it  was  thought  that  legislation  would  complement  public education and that censure of discrimination should be written into the law. In September 1958, Labour politicians made a commitment:

The Labour Party urges Her Majesty's Government now to introduce legislation making illegal the public practice of discrimination. In any case, it pledges the next Labour Government to  take  an  early  opportunity  of  introducing  such  legislation.  …  It will  use  the  full  weight  of  Government  influence  against  all  such discrimination. 64

The  Conservative  Party  and  the  government  disagreed.  They  warned that discrimination might be increased rather than diminished by a formal prohibition against it.

Regardless of the differences it seemed there was much to be learned from the United States. References were made to state legislation against discriminatory restrictive practices in the northern states. It was assumed (as though the problems in both countries were the same) that such American

law was ineffective and that its experience was not relevant to similar issues in Britain.

Before the riots in April 1958, Fenner Brockway had headed a group of Labour  MPs  in  sponsoring  a  Private  Members  Bill  'to  make  illegal discrimination to the detriment of any person on the grounds of colour, race and  religion  in  the  United  Kingdom'.  Brockway's  Bill  (his  third  attempt, uncannily anticipating trouble) to introduce legislation defined 'discrimination'  thus:  '…  a  person  exercises  discrimination  where  he refuses, witholds from or denies to any other person facilities or advantages on the ground of colour, race or religion of that person'. 65 If enacted the Bill was so designed as to have an educational rather than a punitive purpose. The  Bill  did not get a second  reading  in  the  House  of  Commons. Determined,  the  same  group  of  MPs  introduced  it  once  more,  but  again without success. By the summer of 1959 'anti-colour bar' legislation was still  regarded  as  unnecessary.  Indeed,  the  government  had  not  ratified  the ILO  Convention  'to  pursue  a  national  policy  designed  to  eliminate  any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin in respect to employment or occupation' and to introduce appropriate legislation 'where necessary'. 66

## Racial tension

Political debate on the pros and cons of legislation did nothing to diminish tension in some parts of North Kensington. If anything, the politicians who called  for  control  were  also  legitimising  the  fascist  groups'  race-hate campaign to keep Britain white. In this 'climate of conflict' warnings were given  of  potential  violence.  In  the  build-up,  there  were  a  series  of  minor rows  and  incidents.  Predictably,  'Keep  Britain  White'  was  scrawled  on walls and lamp posts, and offensive and provocative leaflets posted through letter boxes. In addition, there was agitation at street corners, where Mosley meetings  whipped  up  race-hatred.  While  there  was  major  confrontation there were deeper rumblings in an environment of physical decay and social discontent.

The tension exploded on the night of 17 May 1959. Kelso Cochrane, a 32-year-old  West  Indian  carpenter  was  murdered  near  a  street  corner  in Kensal  New  Town,  when  about  five  or  six  white  youths  attacked  him. 67

While the  police  thought  robbery  was  the  motive  for  Cochrane's  murder, black people firmly believed that he was killed because he was black. It was clear, however, that the murder increased 'race tension'. Much of what was submerged now came to the surface. Notting Hill and its environs was again in the spotlight. Notting Hill was headlined and dramatised in the press, and the  White  Defence  League  referred  to  Cochrane  as  'this  manufactured martyr'. 68

In  the  face  of  rising  animosity,  the  vulnerable  black  minority  felt  a profound need to organise and fight. An emergency meeting of representatives of West Indian and African organisations in Britain was held in London. Their open letter to the Prime Minister stated, 'Coloured citizens of the United Kingdom and possibly throughout the Commonwealth have lost  confidence  in  the  ability  of  the  law-enforcing  agencies  to  protect them.' 69 Furthermore,  they  asked  Mr  Harold  Macmillan  to  condemn  the murder of Cochrane publicly, and appealed to the trade unions and churches to denounce the killing. In fact, although Macmillan did not make a public statement he convened a special meeting of ministers. Subsequently, after Cabinet  deliberations, a new  co-ordinating  machinery  on  the  'colour problem' was set up in Whitehall.

Soon after, representatives from the black community with a number of delegates of English  Associations  formed  a  joint  Committee  for  the 'immediate  protection  of  our  persons  and  property'.  They  also  set  up  an 'Inter-Racial Friendship Co-ordinating Council'. 70

Cochrane's  death  was  symbolic  of  the  need  for  black  unity.  The  new council sponsored a memorial meeting for Cochrane, which was attended by  about  40  organisations  from  the  three  major  political  parties.  At Cochrane's funeral, about 800 people marched behind the coffin from the church in Ladbroke Grove to Kensal Green cemetery. Among the members of the congregation were the Prime Minister of the West Indies Federation, the  High  Commissioner  for  Ghana  and  the  Mayor  of  Kensington.  The lesson  was  read  by  the  Bishop  of  Kensington.  Many  ordinary  people watched the procession.

In  the  wake  of  the  murder,  attention  was  centred  on  the  causes  and symptoms of tension,  such  as  the  housing  shortage,  crowding  and  blight, casual employment, the shortage of police, manifestations of social disorder and violence generally, and particularly the promoters  of aggressive

prejudice. Government policy had a lot to answer for. Several aspects were stressed. Firstly, as was the case in the 1940s in Liverpool and in 1958 in Nottingham, it was said on the whole black people did not trust the police; a view  that was  mentioned  by  the  Labour  Secretary  of  the  American Association for the Advancement of Coloured People. 71  This private view was now 'openly' stated by representatives of the black communities. Some of the allegations made were that they knew of instances of police brutality against Blacks, that the police tended to be harsher with Blacks than with Whites. These  public  statements  came  at  a  time  when  there  was  concern about certain aspects of police procedure. In fact, at the time, two detective officers  in  Birmingham,  charged  with  assaulting  a  Jamaican  in  the  CID room  at  the  local  police  station,  were  found  guilty,  fined  and  asked  to resign. Secondly,  there  were  complaints  that  there  were  far  too  few policemen  in  the  back  streets  of  North  Kensington.  The  Inter-Racial Friendship Co-ordinating Council suggested the appointment of 'coloured and white special constables'. 72 And the Socialist Labour League talked of setting  up  'Workers  Defence  Squads'  for  Notting  Hill.  Thirdly,  and  most importantly,  special  attention  was  given  to  organisations  which  stirred  up colour  prejudice  and  race  hatred.  Among  these  were  the  Mosley  Union Movement,  the  National  Labour  Party,  the  White  Defence  League,  the League  of  Empire  Loyalists  and  the  Ku-Klux-Klan  who  used  every opportunity to put their theory into practice.

## Post-riots organisations

## The role of the racist groups

The agitation by the Mosley Union Movement and kindred bodies helped to keep race hatred alive. Indeed their share of responsibility for the troubles could not be dismissed. The TUC commenting on the disturbances stated: 'Evidence is accumulating that elements which propagated racial hatred in Britain  and  Europe  in  pre-war  days  are  once  more  fanning  the  flames  of violence.' 73 In  the  weeks  that  followed  the  disturbances,  although  many local  authorities  refused  to  give  the  Union  Movement  permission  to  hold their meetings in the schools or town halls, in February 1959 this ban began to be relaxed and after the summer of 1959 Mosley held several meetings in town halls, particularly in Kensington Town Hall.

After  the  autumn  riots  in  1958,  Mosley  concentrated  in  the  North Kensington  area.  The  Union  Movement's  first  issue  of  the monthly broadsheet,  the North  Kensington  Leader ,  appeared  in  October  1958.  It called  for  'Action  with  Mosley',  insisting  that  'Now  is  the  Time  to Act'. The  Movement  opened  an  office  and  bookshop  to  serve  its  activities  in North Kensington. On his return from South Africa, Mosley was adopted at a 'greatly packed historic' meeting early in April 1959 as the Movement's candidate for North Kensington. In a no-nonsense speech, Mosley predictably  said,  'he  would  send  all  coloured  immigrants  back  to  their homelands'. 74   He  described  the  Union  Movement  as  'quite  a  go-homeparty'.

Also in  existence,  before  and  after  the  disturbances,  was  the  National Labour Party. The NLP published a journal, Combat , the first issue of which appeared in the autumn of 1958 when tension was high. The Party exploited the situation by holding three open air meetings in 10 days at Notting Hill Gate. 75 Another organisation, The White Defence League, circulated racist literature. Its newsheet Black and White News was sold in North Kensington during the outbreak of violence. Its headlines were provocative: 'Blacks Seek White Women', 'Blacks Milk the Assistance Board', 'America Pouring Negro Troops into Britain'. 76

The White Defence League, closely associated with the National Labour Party,  made  every  effort  to  distribute  and  display  their  racist  propaganda. These groups were publicly expressing the private fears of white residents. The  propaganda  they  had  been  circulating  and  the  racial  hatred  they preached  was,  to  say  the  least,  dangerous.  And  before  Cochrane  was murdered,  some  organisations  expressed  anxiety  over  the  'Keep  Britain White' groups. Among them were the British-Caribbean Association and the Conservative Commonwealth Council. But relying on the police to stamp out  fascist  activity  was  no  solution.  In  fact,  the  black  community  was apprehensive of both the police and fascist elements.

## Two kinds of organisation

Between  1958  and  1959,  among  the  fascists  there  was  a  'division  of labour'. On the one hand, there was the Union Movement which aspired to join,  or  work  with,  the  existing  body  politic  (although  they  condemned party politics for making Britain 'the dustbin of the world'). On the other hand, there was the National Labour Party, the White Defence League and

the  Ku-Klux-Klan  among  others  who  regarded  themselves  as  'outsiders'. They took an inflexible, extreme and uninhibited stand. They welcomed the label  'fascist'.  They  agreed  with  Colin  Jordan,  National  Organiser  of  the White Defence League, who said, 'If  a  Fascist  is  a  person  who  wants  to Keep Britain White, then I am a Fascist and proud of it.' 77

In  contrast  with  this  kind  of  unbridled  racist  language,  the  Union Movement  used  'emotive  innuendo  and  insinuation'  before  the  General Election in 1959. The Movement's policy called for 'the establishment of a Europe-Africa economic, cultural and military force to stand between the state  capitalism  of  Russia  and  the  almighty  dollar-worshipping  United States of America'. 78 It also sentimentalised the so-called bullying of white women, calling  for  the  housing  of  Britons  first  and  alerted  its  readers  of Action to a 'Big Coloured Threat To Britain's Health'. The Movement also put forward a three point policy:

- 1. send the coloured immigrants home, with their passage paid by the people who brought them here;
- 2. send them home to good jobs in their own countries, which can be secured by giving them the guaranteed market in Britain for which they have always asked. Give them this market, not for the 10 years they originally suggested, but on a permanent basis;
- 3. give  Britain  at  the  same  time  the  same  rights  as  the  British  Dominions  which  have  long exercised the right to choose which immigrants shall be allowed through their ports. The right of entry for students coming here for a definite period, after which time they would go back to their own countries.

Under this policy the minority of crooks among them would be expelled because of their habits. The majority of decent people among them would be sent home to good jobs among their own families. 79

The  National  Labour  Party  (and  the  White  Defence  League)  was, however,  more  openly  offensive  than  the  Union  Movement.  The  NLP's Combat quoted from Hitler's Mein Kampf and asked 'Was Hitler really our enemy?' The Party's paper described as 'The Voice of British Nationalism' was enough to confuse those who had lost dear ones as Britain fought off Nazi  aggression.  The  Party's  leader,  John  Bean,  was  also  the  Party's Director  of  Policy  and  editor  of Combat . Its President  was  Andrew Fountaine, a Norfolk landowner.

The Party's 'principles' were:

A  new  union  of  the  Dominions  of  British  blood  in  place  of  the Coloured  Commonwealth. An  alliance  with  our  racial  kinsmen  of Western Europe. This, in essence, is the alternative that the National Labour  Party  offers  to  both  Communism  and  Liberal  Democracy, fighting its last rearguard action.

Moreover, the Party was anti-semitic and haunted by Blacks, arguing that black immigration must be stopped for it not only aggravated the housing problem  and  constituted  a  serious  threat  to  workers'  living  standards  in view  of  increasing  unemployment  but,  most  important,  it  would  turn  our nation into 'a race of mongrels'. 80

For the Party's President, race mixing meant the end of 'our race and our culture'. On this premise, he argued, 'If it is Fascist to try to stop that, then  Fascism  is  a  bloody  good  thing.'  In  effect,  they  could  not  align themselves  with  any  group  whose  racial  views  were  not  'sufficiently extreme'. 81

After Cochrane's death, the White Citizen's League (which had the full approval and support of the NLP) implied that the West Indian was killed in order  to  turn  public  opinion  against  white  resistance  organisations  in Notting Hill. The League joined the NLP in a protest meeting in Trafalgar Square, where the cry was: 'Stop the Coloured Invasion! … The nation is being Mongrelised …'

The  other  of  the  'Keep  Britain  White'  groups,  the  Ku-Klux-Klan (denounced by the President of the NLP as a 'Communist organisation') did not  meet  in  Trafalgar  Square  -  they  operated  less  openly.  They  were  the dangerous introverts among the racist groups. 'Secrecy is our defence', they said, 'against those who desire to mongrelise our proud heritage.' Again we see eighteenth century racist arguments of white superiority being repeated. Underlying the slogans in 1958 were insistent threats. Five days before the violence erupted in Nottingham in 1958, they sent a letter to the editor of the West Indian Gazette which read:

## My Dear Mr B. Ape,

Kindly  post  two  copies  of  your  paper  to  the  above  address  every month until ordered to cease.

Possibly  you  are  wondering  why  we  have  so-far  failed  to  pay attention  to  your  audacity  in  setting  up  this  filthy  hack-trash  of  a

paper? Pray good Sir, We, The Aryan Knights miss nothing, close attention has been paid to every issue of this rag, and I do sincerely assure you, the information gleaned has proven of great value to the Klan.

May  we  take  this  opportunity  to  wish  your  …  …  paper  every success whilst you are able to continue printing it.

Aryan regards, A. Whiteman 82

## The General Election

As the General Election of October 1959 approached, Mosley kept up the anti-black propaganda. The other contestants from among the major parties for the North Kensington constituency were George Rogers (Labour), Bob Bulbrook (Conservatives) and Michael Hyndelman for the Liberals. A fifth candidate,  Dhanaraj  Nandawar,  an  Indian  restaurant  owner  stood  as  an Independent  candidate  to  oppose  Mosley  so  that  the  people  of  North Kensington  would  have  the  chance  to  vote  for  racial  integration.  He withdrew his nomination just before the election 'in the interest of unity and the fight against racialism'. 83

The  election  contest  became  well  known  as  the  'ugly'  election,  with Mosley  making  an  unpleasant  address.  While  Blacks  and  'nigger  lovers' and 'Jews' were attacked in North Kensington, the White Defence League and the NLP were active elsewhere as the election drew near. They agitated to  'Keep  Hampstead  White'  because  a  black  local  doctor,  Dr  David  Pitt, was the Labour Party candidate. While Pitt was speaking at a meeting in Hampstead Town  Hall  he  was  heckled  by  a  small  group  shouting  'Keep Britain White'. Two MPs connected with the British Caribbean Association protested in a letter to The Times . 84 Colin Jordan, the National Organiser of the  WDL,  replied  that  'better  race  relations  is  a  euphemism  for  racial treason'. During his campaign Pitt was subjected to much racial abuse. He received insulting telephone calls and his election posters were defaced.

When  the  votes  were  counted,  the  Labour  candidate,  George  Rogers was re-elected in North Kensington. David Pitt, however, lost in Hampstead.  Several  thousand  people  had  cast  their  votes  for  the  fascist organisations, the Union Movement and the NLP. Mosley, however, felt this

was  not  enough.  His  petition  to  the  High  Court  as  'the  first  legal  step towards  obtaining  a  judicial  inquiry'  into  the  conduct  and  validity  of  the North Kensington election was dismissed.

## Liberal groups

While  the  extremist  organisations  with  strident  voices  preached  racial hatred, there was some activity devoted to integration of the black minority through the 'Keep Britain Tolerant' groups. Following the events of 1958, social, educational and welfare activities continued to grow.

## Social activities

Naturally, some West Indians (in general a friendly people) became friends with  their  neighbours.  Many  black  people  also  joined  churches,  political parties,  trade  unions,  student  organisations,  sports,  jazz  and  social  clubs. Throughout  London  there  were  branches  of  the  International  Friendship League. There was also the Overseas Social Centre, the All Nations Social Club  and  the  Linguists  Club.  The  programmes  of  these  clubs,  reflecting their cosmopolitan and inter-racial nature, included dances, socials, lectures and tuition.

Given the discord aroused by the pre-and post-riot events and murder, harmony was the keynote. Thus social organisations were formed, particularly  after  the  disturbances  of  1958,  to  assist  in  the  process  of integration of black people. In the existing frosty atmosphere, some came into being enthusiastically, flickered and died quickly. For example, Harmony Club (the mixed youth club) which started well lasted only six weeks.  Among  those  who  set  up  organisations  were  the  Quakers,  the Methodists and the young socialists. The more persistent of these organisations  were  those  based  on  inter-racial  social  activities.  Most  of these were found in South London. In Brixton, the Racial Brotherhood (one of  the  best  known)  was  formed  by  a  member  of  the  Society  of  Friends. Further,  the  meetings  and  socials  in  Lambeth  Town  Hall,  initiated  years before by the Mayor to bring Blacks and Whites together continued.

There  were  also  clubs  intended  primarily  for  black  people.  It  was assumed  that  'the  newcomers  are  often  too  shy  to  join  clubs  because organised social activities are not a feature of West Indian society, and that they need therefore a period of initiation by themselves'. 85 In this context,

the churches became involved, holding services and organising meetings for West  Indians.  Local  associations  were  also  involved.  For  example,  the Paddington Overseas Students and Workers Committee which was associated with the London Council of Social Service opened an afternoon club  for  West  Indian  mothers. Apart  from  this  direct,  self-help  approach, there  were  other  organisations.  Some  acted  in  an  advisory  and  welfare capacity and some were largely concerned with educating the public, while others concentrated on holding social functions.

## Education and welfare

The education and welfare organisations operated at various levels. At the local level, the Colonial Advisory Panel of the St Pancras Borough Council was  resurrected  after  the  'riots'.  In  Willesden,  early  in  1959,  the  Mayor formed  an  International  Frendship  Committee  'to  undertake  the  work  of helping the newcomers'. One of its practical functions was that assistance was  given  by  members  of  this  Committee  who  investigated  disputes between black landlords  and  white  tenants.  In  Kensington,  a West  Indian social worker was appointed in the autumn of 1958 and the Mayor set up a 'Racial Integration Co-ordinating Committee' which was representative of local organisations and churches, and white and coloured 'public persons'. The Committee was meant to promote harmony locally.

The work being done was important, but limited. Co-ordination of their various activities was vital to effectiveness. Unfortunately, these organisations were little known and stability was lacking, except in a few cases.  One  such  case  was  the  Universities  and  Left  Review  Club  which organised  the  'Notting  Hill  Project'.  They  were  interested  in  local  youth (black and white) 'inter-racial in theory but hardly in practice'; in assisting tenants with their rent and housing problems; and with the establishment of a Residents' Association. 86

Another attempt at co-ordination was a federal body, the 'Committee for Inter-Racial Unity in West London' which was launched by a Conference held in July 1959.

In  attendance  were  100  delegates  from  local  branches  of  the  Labour Party,  the  Co-operative Movement, trade unions, trade councils and black organisations.  The  Conference  resolved  to  'carry  out  activities  against racialism in all its forms and in support of greater inter-racial unity in West London', to 'Co-ordinate  a  drive  of  watchful  pressure  and  propaganda  to

improve  welfare  services  and  housing  policies in areas of changing population, and to ensure that local authorities use to the full, the powers that  they  already  possess.'  A  'Unity'  leaflet  was  published,  followed  by another conference a few months later. Indeed there was a multiplicity of conferences, committees,  associations, all providing advice (all wellmeaning) to promote inter-racial harmony. As it was, there were 'far more organisations  and  resolutions  in  North  Kensington  than  concrete  efforts'. This  had  begun  to  cause  some  embarrassment.  Their  effectiveness  was questioned. In theory there was no problem, but how practical were they? Thus one local newspaper asked 'Will Too Many Do-Gooders Pave the Path to Notting HELL?' 87

In  this  Kensington  borough,  local  organisations  proved  inadequate. Much was dependent on other organisations in the wider society of London. There were many enthusiastic organisers whose attentions had been focused on  the  events  in  Kensington.  Among  these  groups  was  the  Advisory Committee on the Welfare of West Indians in London. It was established in 1956 by the London Council of Social Service to help and to co-ordinate the  work  of  the  various  bodies  dealing  with  West  Indian  immigrants  in London. Also in existence was the Metropolitan Coloured Peoples Housing Association, formed in 1957, to alleviate the housing difficulties of black immigrants and their  families  in  London. The  purpose  of  the Association was  to  buy  and  convert  houses  into  flats  to  be  let  to  black  people  at 'reasonable rents'. By doing so, the Association hoped 'to assist in the real integration  of  newcomers  from  overseas  into  the  whole  of  London'.  By 1960, very little progress was made in this direction. Only one house, with five flats, had been opened in Hackney - a long way from Notting Hill but equally depressed. 88

Much  more  successful  was  the  Race  Relations  Committee  of  the Society  of  Friends  whose  function  was  essentially  educational.  It  advised Quakers  to  participate  in  inter-racial  clubs.  In  turn,  a  Quaker  group  gave practical  assistance  (scrubbing  and  painting  houses)  in  the  'miserable' Kensal New Town district.

There were many other groups which showed general concern for race relations  in  Britain.  Among  these  were  the  Institute  of  Race  Relations. Unlike other organisations which pronounced, and indeed campaigned for, the  active  disapproval  of  intolerance,  'the  Institute  is  precluded  by  the

Memorandum of articles of its incorporation from expressing an opinion on any aspect of the relations between races'. There was also the Council of Christians and Jews, the National Council for Civil Liberties, the Haldane Society, the Movement for Colonial Freedom, the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination in Sport, and the Stars Campaign for Inter-Racial Friendship.  At  the  national  level,  the  British  Caribbean  Association  was formed during the riots of 1958 in order firstly, 'To develop and increase friendship  and  understanding  between  the  people  of  the  West  Indies (including  British  Guiana  and  British  Honduras)  and  the  people  of  the United Kingdom', and secondly, 'To stimulate and encourage all forms of mutual aid between the West Indies and Great Britain.'

## West Indian and Asian organisations

If there was a lack of the sense of 'community' among Blacks after the riots and Cochrane's murder, there was every reason for them to form their own organisations.  Yet,  it  was  doubtful  whether  the  migrants  would,  or  could develop their own organisations on a large scale. It was argued that only a minority of West Indians who were living in Britain took an active part in organisations  though  all  were  more  familiar  with  the  concept  of  formal association  than  the  newcomers  were.  And  also  that  the  duality  of  West Indian  attitudes  (should  they  take  part  in  separate  or  in  joint  'integrated' organisations?) presented a problem. But this 'duality' was not peculiar to West Indians  in  view  of  the  ambiguity  and  diversity  of  English  attitudes. Not  yet  used  to  being  'organisation  men'  it  was  not  necessary  for  West Indians  to  be  organised  to  express  their  sociability.  Indeed  they  brought with  them  a  talent  for  spontaneous,  informal  social  contact.  Thus,  the pattern of West Indian social organisations was not clearly defined. In fact, they were 'unstable'.

Informal  contacts  were  made  through  meetings  held  in  rooms,  in basements,  street  corners,  markets,  cafes  and  barber  shops.  The  barber shops,  in  particular,  served  as  community  centres  where  West  Indian newspapers were read and discussed, where all the latest news was heard, where  one  could  get  information  about  new  arrivals,  about  possible vacancies for jobs and accommodation, about threats of unemployment, and the  announcements of meetings and dances. Apart from the barber shops, migrants (particularly newcomers) met in their own licensed clubs and in

shopping  centres  such  as  Brixton  Market,  Camden  Town  and  Portobello Road.

## Formal associations

The formal social links among West Indians were less widespread than the informal ones. There were four main types of organisations: student groups, church groups, 'harmony' clubs (which stressed integration); and associations primarily concerned with the rights of black people in Britain and their liberation in other parts of the Commonwealth.

West Indian students joined various organisations - those in their own colleges  and  universities,  those  concerned  with  all  overseas  students  in London, and the West Indian Students' Union. Generally, it seemed, there was  a  clear  separation  between  the  students  and  working-class  migrants. The  majority  of  students  belonged  to  a  different  social  group.  Their  stay was not only more limited, but generally more comfortable and hopeful. In short  (and  in  effect)  black  students  posed  no  threat  whatsoever  to  British society.

Religious  groups  reflected  the  social  and  cultural  diversity  among newcomers.  In  London,  there  were  about  eight  gospel  halls  with  West Indian  congregations  whose  services  were  essentially  evangelical.  These services contrasted sharply to the more austere atmosphere of the established church in Britain.

The Harmony Clubs and the Associations which emerged in response to the disturbances of 1958 gained new support after Kelso Cochrane's murder in  1959.  Official  West  Indian  policy  favoured  the  Harmony  Clubs  rather than separate associations. When  Norman  Manley  visited  Britain in September  1958  he  felt  there  was  a  need  for  a  full-scale  programme  of integration;  a  'Grassroots  Plan'.  He  wanted  a  better  community  spirit, integration  and  inter-racial  harmony,  to  be  effected  through  a  network  of British and West Indian committees working together in every community in Britain. 89

In the new trend which followed, inter-racial clubs were established by West Indians themselves. The Blacks had come through their phase of fear and were extending friendship to Whites. Thus, the Harmonist Movement was founded by MacDonald Stanley (a black West Indian) to bring about 'inter-racial harmony amongst all peoples of the world'. The first Harmonist  Club  was  opened  in  November  1958  in  a  church  hall  in

Stamford  Hill  where  social  evenings  were  held  on  Saturday  nights.  The Movement also issued a newsheet, The Harmonist .

The Clapham  Club, another inter-racial club, was founded after Cochrane's murder by a Jamaican post-office worker who had served in the RAF. The Club aimed 'to promote good will between peoples of all races: to foster and encourage a spirit of mutual understanding and respect … by study  of  their  backgrounds  -  social,  cultural,  historical'.  With  a  total membership of 70 there was said to be an equal number of white and black members. 90  As a model, this was success indeed.

Most  of  the  organisers  of  inter-racial  clubs  were  also  active  in  the associations,  primarily  for  Blacks  committed  to  promoting  their  specific interests.  This  dual  participation  was  inevitable  for  those  concerned  with race  relations  in  London. Very  quickly,  these  organisers  found  that  it  was necessary to operate at both levels.

Although small, the various black organisations were 'alert, active and well-connected'  to  exercise some  influence.  Among  the  organisations strengthened after August 1958 were the Association for the Advancement of  Coloured  People,  the  Coloured  People's  Progressive  Association,  the United  Kingdom  Coloured  Citizens  Association  and  a  branch  of  the People's National Movement (the Party then - and still - in government in Trinidad and Tobago). Although membership was open to Whites (indeed white people were among their officers) these organisations were founded and run essentially by black people, mainly West Indians.

The AACP was, however, in some respects in a category apart. It was presided  over  by  Mrs  Amy  Dashwood  Garvey,  the  widow  of  Marcus Garvey. She ran a hostel and club in North Kensington. This was a case in point  where  one  leader  worked  at  several  levels.  There  were  also  several groups primarily established by and for Africans.

The  CPPA,  on  the  other  hand,  had  a  list  of  about  500  members.  Its motto  was  'United  We  Stand  -  Divided  We  Fall'.  Its  objects  were  'To protect the rights and privileges of its members as citizens; to strive for their social, economic  and  political advancement;  to work  for inter-racial understanding'. 91

This Association's officers were also connected with other organisations furthering  the  interests  of  black  people.  In  order  to  lead,  the  black  leader

had to co-ordinate a number of activities in order to get a perspective and direction.

A great  deal  depended  on  leadership.  Many West  Indian  leaders  were involved in essentially black or 'integrated' organisations of various kinds. This  group  of  black  leaders,  particularly  West  Indian  leaders  in  London, was drawn from the ranks of workers, clergymen, intellectuals, professional politicians  and  welfare  workers,  among  others.  Most  of  them  were  in  the 30-40  age  group  and  had  already  lived  in  Britain  for  some  time. As  the network  of  interrelationships  between  organisations  grew,  West  Indian leaders assumed increasing importance which, unfortunately, did not reflect the strength of the individual organisations which they represented.

In order to bring together newcomers and to cement this multiplicity of small,  unstable  black  organisations,  it  was  necessary  to  have  a  two-way flow of communication between the leaders and the mass of migrants. The importance  of  a  journal  reflecting  essentially  the  black  experience  (to identify the major problems and views) was grasped by Claudia Jones, the editor of the West Indies Gazette . In its first issue, which appeared in March 1958,  the  monthly Gazette stated  that  West  Indians  in  Britain  'form  a community with its own special wants and problems which our own paper alone  would  allow  us  to  meet'.  In  the  summer  of  1957,  a  group  of  West Indians,  concerned  with  problems  of  unemployment,  housing  and  colour prejudice spoke to some 2000 West Indians in their homes, at dances and at socials. They found that the migrants 'wanted an organisation to represent their  interests'  and  'welcomed  efforts  to  unite  and  further  British-West Indian unity'. As a result and for this purpose, the West Indian Gazette came into being. By  1960  the Gazette had  established itself with  a total circulation  of  15,000  copies.  (Another  monthly, Link ,  first  published  in November  1958  was  less  successful  and  was  discontinued  after  a  few issues. Encouraged, a year later, in November 1959, one of the people who had been concerned with the production of Link brought out a new monthly, the Anglo-Caribbean News.) 92

The Gazette carried  news  about  race  relations  in  Britain,  focusing  on questions  such  as  prejudice  and  discrimination,  reports  of  the  existing, relevant organisations and on the personal successes and hardships of black people.

In  spite  of  the  fact  that  England  'is  no  bed  of  roses',  migration continued at an increased rate because  of population and  economic

pressures in the Caribbean territories. Moreover, the Gazette informed the black community in Britain of developments in the West Indies, the United States and Africa and on general political issues in Britain. Its advertisements included the announcements of meetings, of steamship lines to  the  Caribbean,  of  West  Indian  shops,  clubs  and  restaurants  in  London. Indeed, it was the West Indian Gazette which organised the first 'Caribbean Carnival' in London in January 1959. Through this event, it was hoped to bind West Indians in the United Kingdom together as never before. In its carnival brochure, the Gazette said that it stood for an 'Independent United Democratic State of West Indians in the British Commonwealth' and 'For unity  of  West  Indians  and  other  coloured  people  in  the  United  Kingdom. For friendship with the British people, based on equality and human dignity for  peoples,  irrespective  of  race,  colour  or  origin.'  Further,  the Gazette intended  to  assist  in  the  payment  of  fines  of  'black  and  white'  youths involved in the Notting Hill events.

During the  1950s,  the  need  to  assert  the  solidarity  of  black  people  in Britain  had  been  increasingly  stressed  as  the  horizon  of  'community' expanded. This was reflected  in  the  'Anglo-Caribbean  Diary'  of  the West Indian  Gazette .  But  with  a  growing  influx  of  Asians  and  Africans,  this feature was renamed the 'Afro-Asian-Caribbean-UK Unity Diary'. 93 Broadening  the  scope  of  the  column  was  timely,  as  immigration  control became, once again, the major issue in British politics.

## The door is shut

After the Conservative Party won the election in 1959 with a large majority, the 'restrictionist lobby' which courted stringent control of black immigration became active. This instilled fear among immigrants who sent word to their families, relatives and friends that the door was likely to be shut. Thus, more black settlers came to Britain. This 'unarmed invasion' in which the number of West Indian immigrants jumped from 16,400 in 1959 to  49,000  in  1960,  provided  the  anti-immigration  lobby  with  a  stronger argument. 94

In  historical  perspective,  the  black  presence  has  always  raised  fears among white racists in Britain. Deportation and repatriation of black people

from Britain was, of course, nothing new. The issue of black immigration had been a constant preoccupation in Britain. By 1958 it had recurred.

The  Commonwealth  was  essentially  'The  White  Man's  Club'. As  the conflict  between  the  exploited  labourer  and  his  white  oppressor  escalated after the Second World War, the British Labour Party and the Trade Union Movement sent out their 'labour missionaries' to advise colonial governments on bringing about industrial peace. The Labour Party worked closely with the TUC in fostering the development of colonial trade unions. The concept of 'the Brotherhood of Man', strong in the Labour Party, led after  Indian  Independence  in  1947,  to  the  Party's  anxiety  to  keep  India within the British Commonwealth. This resulted in the British Nationality Act of 1948, which received the support of both the Labour and Conservative  Parties.  The  Act  provided  citizens  of  a  Commonwealth country  with  the  common  status  of  being  British  subjects.  In  effect,  this meant  that  Indian  nationals  retained  their  status  as  British  subjects,  even when India became a republic. This constitutional change in the relationship between  Britain  and  India  and  Pakistan,  however,  did  not  change  British attitudes to the non-white colonies.

During  the  1950s,  as  head  of  the  new  Commonwealth,  'a  multiracial society', Britain set the pace as moral leader of the world. This was a time of  'high  idealism'.  British  leaders  were,  on  the  whole,  pleased  with  their international  standing.  Indeed  it  was  felt  that  all  Commonwealth  citizens should have the opportunity to enter and leave the mother country freely. Any  limitation to this right therefore was  seen  as undermining  the foundation  of  the  new  Commonwealth  and  would  thus  call  into  question Britain's moral leadership.

As yet, black immigration was still largely an issue contained in London and  the  Midlands.  While  some  questions  were  asked  in  the  House  of Commons,  the  subject  had  not  entered  the  national  mind.  However,  the 1958  race  riots  changed  this.  Public  awareness  was  alerted  to  the  black migrant's  presence.  In  effect,  the  black  migrant  predictably  became  the scapegoat for deficient housing and existing and potential unemployment. Thus, there was a 'colour problem' in Britain. As fear was encouraged by white racists, politicians saw the solution to the 'colour problem' in a ban or severe restriction of black immigration from the Commonwealth countries. George Rogers, Labour MP  for North Kensington demanded early legislation  to  halt  'the  tremendous  influx',  while  Alec  Douglas-Home,

Junior Minister for Commonwealth Relations was in no doubt that 'curbs will have to be put on the unrestricted flow of immigrants to Britain from the West Indies'. Moreover, the Conservative Party Conference (aware of the public mood) added its support for control of black immigration. One public  opinion  poll  showed  that  75  per  cent  of  those  questioned  were  in favour of control. Thus, immigration and race entered British politics. The ideal of free entry of black people into Britain was called into question. On this  issue  the  Commonwealth  Relations  Office  and  the  Colonial  Office stood opposed to the Home Office.

Moreover,  the  British  government  was  faced  with  the  problem  of administration in the event of control, since the majority of black migrants, at  the  time,  were  from  the West  Indies,  and  as  such  were  citizens  of  'the United Kingdom and Colonies'. Any legal redefinition of British citizenship would have courted the charge of racialism by the affected Commonwealth countries.  To  further  complicate  matters,  the  process  of  Federation  in  the West Indies was already underway. Once federated, the British government hoped  that,  like  India  and  Pakistan,  West  Indian  emigration  would  be controlled at source.

Taken  together  then,  these  considerations  led  to  the  government's rejection of Sir Cyril Osborne's call for immigration control. The debate on Osborne's motion revealed the racist fears of some MPs from both parties. Martin Lindsay, the Tory MP felt that 'A question which affects the future of our own race and breed is not one we should merely leave to chance.' 95 And Frank Tomney, the Labour MP warned that 'The coloured races will exceed the white races in a few years by no less than five to one. This will be  a  formidable  problem  for  the  diminishing  members  of  the  white  races throughout the world.' 96

Although the government and the parties had sensed the public mood, they were content to bide their time. But not for long. Several months later, at  the  General  Election,  the  'unpleasant  and  controversial'  issue  of  black immigration  was  revived  in  July  1960  with  R.  A.  Butler,  then  Home Secretary, saying, 'It is very unlikely that this country will turn away from her  traditional  policy  of  free  entry.' 97 Not  surprisingly,  Sir  Cyril  Osborne continued  his  campaign  for  control,  actively  supported  by  a  few  working class  and  lower-middle  class  Tory  MPs.  Support  for  them  grew  with  the formation of the Birmingham Immigration Control Association.

To many,  black immigration control was  a foregone conclusion. Inevitably,  the  private  views  of  the  policy-makers  had  started  to  become public. A departmental committee was set up to reexamine the mechanics of immigration control. 98 The  Committee recommended control on the basis of  the  availability  of  jobs  in  Britain.  When  the  details  were  leaked  to  the press in January  1961  to  test  the  temperature  of  the  electorate, the Birmingham Evening Mail and The Observer were confident that Commonwealth immigration would be controlled. 99

Six  months  later,  a  Gallup  Poll  showed  67  per  cent  in  favour  of restrictions,  6  per  cent  for  a  total  ban  and  21  per  cent  for  continued  free entry. The Tories were in no doubt that the time was right to take action. The  Party  Conference  favoured  immigration  control  which  was  then inserted in to the Queen's Speech. Subsequently a Bill was published on 17 November, and on 27 February 1962 the Bill was passed by 107 votes. The Act, which took effect from 1 July 1962, restricted entry to Commonwealth citizens  who  held  current  work  vouchers  issued  by  the  then  Ministry  of Labour. The actual scheme of control was left out of the Act; thus changes could be made without the approval of Parliament. 100

If the Tory Party policy on black immigration was predictable, how did the  Labour  Party  with  its  commitment  to  the  socialist  doctrine  'The Brotherhood of Man' approach and deal with the issue? In the 1950s and the  1960s,  the  Labour  Party  consistently  opposed  restrictions.  In  the  end, however, with its sights set on forming a government, the Party accepted 'public opinion'. A number of reasons have been given for this change in position. When the Party was formed in 1900 it immediately identified itself with the exploited masses in the British colonies. It took a stand on Home Rule  in  India.  In  Africa  and  the  West  Indies  it  sought  to  ameliorate  the conditions of the oppressed working classes. Indeed, the new Commonwealth was the brainchild of the post-war Labour government. The Party  favoured  a  multi-racial  Commonwealth  and  had  no  doubt  that  the immigration  problem  was  'based  on  colour'. After  the  1958  riots,  it  was also  aware  that  'any  form  of  British  legislation  limiting  Commonwealth immigration  into  this  country  would  be  disastrous  to  our  status  in  the Commonwealth and to the confidence of Commonwealth people'. But some of  the  Labour  Party's  ideals,  such  as  'The  Brotherhood  of  Man'  became highly  questionable.  The  electoral  irrelevance  of  such  ideals  became  an

electoral liability as shown by the results of the 1959 General Election and in  the  by-election  in  Birmingham  which  was  won  by  the  Birmingham Control Association's candidate who received twice as many votes as the Labour candidate.

Even  at  this  stage,  in spite of its electoral liability, the national leadership  of  the  Party  remained  committed  to  the  'open  door'  policy. A moral principle was at stake and was admirably upheld by Hugh Gaitskell. But  while  the  Party  declined  a  second  reading  of  the  Commonwealth Immigrants Bill in November 1961 (because the Bill introduced control and because 'it was widely held to introduce a colour bar into the legislation', the  question  still  remained:  how  long  could  the  Labour  Party  disregard popular  opinion?  The  short  answer  was  not  very  long  since  there  was  a fundamental conflict within the Party between a moral ideal and practical reality. Sooner rather than later, the Party had to take a public stand. After making  a  passionate  speech  against  the  Immigration  Bill  in  Parliament, Patrick Gordon Walker, the Shadow Foreign Secretary and Labour MP for Smethwick,  had  to  face  the  strong  disapproval  of  many  of  his  white constituents.  He  took  note  of  their  feelings.  He  did  not  criticise  the  Bill when it was finally debated in February 1962. In fact, he did not vote for or against the Bill. This episode of Labour representation was the thin end of the wedge.

The  Labour  Party  had  begun  to  move  towards  the  control  advocates. The shift was, however, not complete. In true British tradition a compromise  was  reached.  After  saying  'We  do  not  contest  the  need  for control of immigration into this country', Harold Wilson offered not to vote against  renewal  of  the Act,  if  the  government  initiated  consultations  with Commonwealth governments to control immigration from their  end. This offer was not accepted, and the Labour Party voted against the Act. 101  By doing so Labour supporters felt estranged.

By October 1964, however, the Labour Party manifesto for the election stated: 'Labour accepts that the number of immigrants entering the United Kingdom must be limited. Until satisfactory agreement covering this can be negotiated  with  the  Commonwealth,  a  Labour  government  will  retain immigration  control.' 102 By  that  time  the  pendulum  had  swung  the  other way.  Some  Labour  candidates,  during  the  election  campaign,  blamed  the Tories  for  'the  whole  wave  of  immigration'.  In  Southall,  the  Labour

candidate said 'Labour has not been in power for thirteen years to control the flow of immigrants, and before that Southall had not been in difficulties.' 103 The Labour candidate for Wandsworth Central had issued a leaflet entitled: 'Things About Immigration the Tories Want You To Forget' which  said,  'Large-scale  immigration  has  occurred  only  under  this  Tory Government.' 104 But  this  dramatic  change  in  the  Party's  stand  on  black immigrant control was not enough. For, it seemed that aligning themselves with the Blacks would ensure their come-uppance. Although the Smethick Labour Party campaign leaflet for Gordon Walker proclaimed: 'Immigrants only arrived in Smethick in large numbers during the past ten years - while the  Tory  government  was  in  power',  the  Smethwick  voters  refused  to forgive  him  for  his  earlier  stand  against  control.  He  lost  his  seat  in  a dramatic way. He received 5754 votes less than when he was elected and the  tag  of  'Nigger  Lover'. 105 There  was  fierce  opposition  to  people  like Gordon  Walker  and  he  was  made  to  feel  the  displeasure  of  those  who disagreed  with  him  when  he  contested  a  safe  Labour  seat  in  Leyton, London. His defeat reduced the Labour government's majority to three.

Given  that  another  poll  had  showed  that  95  per  cent  of  the  voters wanted  'stringent  control',  the  Labour  government  was  faced  with  the prospect  of  tighter  immigration  control.  In  March  1965,  according  to Harold  Wilson,  since  the  Act  was  not  working  as  intended  because  of 'evasions'  a  fresh  examination  of  the  whole  problem  was  necessary. Furthermore Richard Crossman criticised the 'completely ineffective controls,' of the Tories. 106 It was claimed that during 1963 and 1964, some of the 10,255 citizens from the new  Commonwealth  had  'evaded' immigration  controls.  As  usual  the  numbers  game  was  played.  Sheila Patterson  observed  that,  'The  so-called  'evidence'  has  been  presented selectively  to  create  public  alarm  about  evasion  by  coloured  immigrants alone.'  By  constant  repetition,  she  added,  the  government's  estimates  of 'evasions' had acquired the status of fact. 107 Thus racism through a Labour government was becoming more institutionalised, and would have profound consequences on the black community.

The presentation of a White Paper to Parliament in August 1965 which, among  other  things,  authorised  the  immigration  officer  to  make  police registration  a  condition  for  entry  if  he  doubted  the  entrant's  genuineness, began a process of growing hostility between migrants long settled here and

the police. The White Paper proposed work vouchers for 8500 a year. The age of entry of dependent children was lowered from 18 to 16. The British public welcomed these strictures; 88 per cent of the population supported the White Paper. At last the government was being representative of public feelings on control of black migrants, while Irish and European immigration 'continued unabated'.

While criticism of the White Paper came from the National Council for Civil Liberties, the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination and the Young Fabians,  the  TUC  avoided  the  issue.  At  the  Labour  Party  Conference,  a motion  asking  the  government  to  withdraw  the  White  Paper  was  lost  in spite  of  the  block  votes  from  the  Transport  and  General  Workers'  Union. The  Economist commented:  'The  representatives  of  the  British  working man faithfully reflected his aversion to any spirit of universal brotherhood which touched him too closely.' 108

Predictably,  Harold  Wilson  defended  the  White  Paper  and  repudiated 'the  libel that  government  policy  is  based  either  on  colour  or  racial prejudice'. In effect by resenting and repudiating the libel of racialism, he was  doing  precisely  what  Tory  leaders  had  done  at  the  time  of  the  1961 Commonwealth  Immigrants  Bill.  According  to  William  Deedes  (then Minister without Portfolio) the Bill was designed to 'restrict the influx of coloured  immigrants'  but  'we  were  reluctant  to  say  so  openly'. 109 No wonder  the  Labour  Party's  White  Paper  received  the  full  support  of  the Tories.

As  the  'open  door'  policy  on  Commonwealth  immigration  became threatened,  more  attention  was  paid  to  the  settlement  of  Blacks.  But settlement  was,  and  continued  to  prove,  uncomfortable  for  the  black migrant, particularly in view of Sir Cyril Osborne's statement that 'This is a white man's country, and I want it to remain so', 110 and John Hallows's (a reporter  of  black  settlers'  reactions  to  the  1961  Immigration  Bill)  finding that  'No one with a dark face is grinning anymore. … Now they feel the Immigration Bill controversy will make them less acceptable'. 111

The fear of control triggered an increase in the number of migrants and their  dependants  when  the  Immigration Act  took  effect  in  July  1962.  For those who had beaten the 'ban', the process of setting up homes, in short, of settlement, had begun. The semi-skilled and unskilled workers formed the nucleus of the black working class in Britain. But why immigration control?

To better understand this 'control', black migrant labour must be viewed in the context of capitalism and class.

The Black Working Class (1962-1986)

## 8 Capitalism, Class, Black Workers and Racial Disadvantage

After  1962,  in  view  of  the  decreasing  numbers  of  black  workers  allowed into Britain, black migrant labour had become part of the British working class, at least in theory. Given this broad categorisation, it is necessary to locate  black  workers  more  specifically  within  the  class  politics  of  British capitalism.

To get a clearer perspective of how black migrant workers came to hold their position within the working class, they must be viewed as essentially migrant  labour  within  the  economic  and  political  framework  of  British capitalism. The concepts, capitalism and class then, are directly related to black  migrant  labour.  Marx's  definition  of  the  classes  in  relation  to production  states  that,  in  the  capitalist  mode  of  production,  there  are  two main classes: the bourgeoisie and the working class. This formulation has come under heavy attack. However, given that Britain is a capitalist social formation,  according  to  one  writer,  class  relations  can  be  understood  in terms  of  three  processes  underlying  the  social  relations  of  production: control of labour power, control of the physical means of production, and

control of investment and resources. 1 Control of all three processes is in the hands of  the  capitalist  class,  while  the  working  class  has  no  control  over investment or the means of production. Indeed, the worker's labour power (both mental and manual) is sold for a wage. Moreover, the worker has no control  over  the  labour  power  of  others.   Thus,  the  capitalist  mode  of 2 production 'produces and reproduces two unambiguous classes, the bourgeoisie  and  the  working  class,  and  certain  contradictory  locations between these classes'.

In relating this class structure to Britain, Westergaard and Resler found that 'The continuing predominance of capital makes for deep fissures in the social structure. The economic order draws major lines of cleavage between people whose life circumstances and share in influence contrast, however they themselves may see their position and respond to it.'  As it is, and ever 3 has  been  (under  capitalism)  the  ownership  and  control  of  capital  remain firmly  in  the  hands  of  a  very  small  proportion  of  the  population.  The majority,  who  can  only  sell  their  labour  power  are  at  the  mercy  of  the 'swings and roundabouts' inherent in capitalism. Historically, these classes have, in general, tended to reproduce themselves.

Within the working class, however, there are class fractions. Miles and Phizaclea have used the concept of fraction to refer to an objective position within a class boundary which is, in turn, determined by both economic and politico-ideological  relations.  Thus,  the  structure  of  class  determination simultaneously  defines  the  position  of  one  class vis-à-vis another  and cleavages  within  a  class.   They  argue  that  all  classes  are  objectively 4 fractionalised.  Indeed,  a  class  can  be  said  to  have  objective  interests  in relation to that other class with which it shares an antagonistic relation but in  any  given  social  formation  class  relations  are  simultaneously  relations between class  fractions  and  this  applies  both  within  and  between  classes. Moreover, they contend that the precise nature and effect of these relations between fractions of classes (and hence between classes and classes) is a 'historical and conjunctional' question.

Since 1945 then there have been important changes in the British labour market. For example, decline in the staple heavy industries was offset by expansion in the service sector and white-collar employment.  By the mid5 1970s, it was in these expanding sectors that half the female wage labour force  was  employed,  compared  to  only  a  quarter  in  the  manufacturing

industries.  Increasingly, women were employed in industries that paid low 6 wages. As women, they were paid women's rates so that the sexual division of labour within the family was  repeated  in waged  work.  In  time, 'industrialised  housework'  were  the  types  of  jobs  done  by  women  in  the public and private sectors of the economy. The more 'female' a job became, the more it was devalued. Clerical work, for example, became low status, low wage occupations, when compared with skilled manual work. 7

Thus,  the  married  woman's  objective  of  alleviating  the  economic distress at home by doing wage-work was frustrated. This need to work was reflected  in  the  fact  that  the  number  of  married  women  in  the  workforce doubled in the twenty years from 1951 to 1971. 8  Moreover, always ready to exploit labour, employers (aided and abetted by the state) viewed women as playing  a  dual  role.  Their  primary  function  was  as  domestic  labourers, while of secondary and temporary importance, was the wage work for the employer.  This  duality  armed  their  employers  with  a  number  of  reasons why  their  opportunities  for  training  and  promotion  (never  mind  higher wages) should be reduced. It is not surprising, therefore, that with all the demands  made  on  their  time,  some  two-thirds  of  women  wage  labourers were  part-time  workers.  Thus,  their  already  vulnerable  position  became even more so.

Given the low status and low pay of these women, a distinction must be made between black labour and white female labour. Before moving on, a further distinction seems necessary. One survey showed that among black workers there was a lower incidence of discrimination among black women who had applied for jobs in comparison with black men.

Of major significance in the field of female employment for those aged between  16  and  54  years,  it  was  found  that  75  per  cent  of  West  Indian women were working compared with 55 per cent of all women. 9  This is not surprising  in  view  of  the  larger  families  among West  Indians.  Indeed,  the difference  in  the  proportion  of  West  Indian,  as  compared  to  all  women engaged  in  wage  labour  is  highest  during  child-bearing  years.  Therefore, that  dual  role  in  production  was  (and  is)  more  likely  to  be  performed  by black women in Britain taken as a whole.

Overall then, as an actual or potential domestic labourer, a woman's role was,  (and  is)  used  ideologically  against  her,  in  the  form  of  sexism.  This kind  of  discrimination  helps  to  determine  her  subordinate  position  as  a

wage  labourer.  Thus,  sexism,  like  racism,  refers  to  a  process  of  social categorisation. Women have therefore come to occupy a particular position in terms  of  economic,  political  and  ideological  relations  in  order  to constitute a class fraction, within the working class.

## Migrant labour and capitalism in Western Europe

While migrant labour is geographically mobile in order to satisfy individual advancement, it simultaneously satisfies the demands of capital where there is a shortage  of  labour. Historically, migrant  labour  has  either  been intranational (or internal) or international (or external). The former involves movement within a national boundary, while the latter involves movement across  national  boundaries.  Furthermore,  international  migrant  labour  can either be colonial or proximate in form. Whereas in both instances there is an economic relationship between the two nations of dominant/dependent, the  nature  of  the  related  politico-ideological  domination/dependence  is different. For one of the features of the process of colonisation is the direct politico-ideological  domination  of  the  colonised  social  formation  to  the extent of direct or indirect political rule and the development of an ideology based on the inferiority of the subjected people. An example of this form of international migration is migration from the West Indies to Britain.

On the other hand, in international migrant labour, there is generally no direct politico-ideological domination of the economically dependent nation.  Migration  from  Greece  and  Turkey  to  Germany  is  an  example  of this  form  of  international  migrant  labour. 10 Thus,  there  is  an  international exploitation  of  labour  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  capitalist  mode  of production. In many Western European countries migrant labour is directly recruited  to  low  grade  jobs.  This  economic  subordination  is  accompanied by  disadvantage  in  housing,  education  and  in  political  rights.  It  has  been argued that migrant workers should be seen in the context of this common social  and  economic  situation,  and  that  this  objective  division  within  the class is also accompanied  by  a  subjective  division,  namely  that  the indigenous  working  class,  because  of  its  authoritarianism,  'a  product  of repressive  socialisation'  and  a  fear  of  competition,  is  highly  prejudiced towards  migrant  workers.  In  turn,  this  leads  to  division  in  the  labour movement, giving the advantage to the dominant class. 11  Thus, the specific

economic and social circumstances do not change the class determination of migrant labour. Hence, migrant labour constitutes a distinct fraction of the working class.

Moreover, migrant labour as a class fraction is better understood when set against the backdrop of post-war economic growth and accumulation of capital.  The  expansion  of  service  industries  and  the  emergence  of  new industries attracted labour away from the undesirable low wage jobs. This labour shortage, in the context of full employment until the late 1960s, was filled  by  the  internationalisation  of  the  labour  market.  In  other  words,  by migrant  labour.  But,  there  were  alternatives  to  this  option.  For  example, higher  wages  could  have  been  paid  to  attract  labour  into  the  low-wage jobs. 12 However,  this  alternative  ignores  the  fact  that  some  sections  of capital depended  upon  migrant  labour  'as  a  source  of  excess  profit necessary to compensate for their below average rate of profit'. 13

Further, capital was able to draw on female labour. This option however would have been cumbersome and costly in terms of child care and other social facilities. Thus, the contract labour system was preferred in Germany, France and Switzerland, and migrant labour from the New Commonwealth was  used  in  Britain.  The  British  case  is  particularly  interesting  in  that migrant labour involved almost no expenditure on social capital. Therefore in  retrospect, it  has  become abundantly clear that many of the 'problems' that arose from migration had little or nothing to do with the character of the migrants themselves, but rather to the failure of the British authorities to provide adequate housing, social and welfare facilities. 14

The migrant labour 'solution' in Western European capitalist economies generally has a self-generating process, producing such effects as tending to occupy a specific economic position within the broader category of wage labour (for example, it is not contained within the manual working class but extended  to  the  semi  -  and  unskilled  sectors  of  the  working  class)  and occupying a distinct position in political and ideological relations. Migrant labour occupies a subordinate legal position. For example, it has effectively been denied participation in the political process. Indeed in some Western European countries migrant labour has been denied the right of permanent residence, prevented and/or discouraged from  being accompanied  by families, and denied access to some institutions and services. 15

Moreover, in ideological relations, the subordinate position of migrant labour is evident in that they have become the object of agitation by rightwing  and  neo-Nazi  political parties. Thus,  the physical and  cultural characteristics  have  been  used  to  justify  discriminatory  action  against migrant  labour.  As  'guest'  workers,  on  contract,  both  capital  and  labour have, in certain circumstances, agreed that it is in their mutual interests to restrict migrant  labour  to  certain  sections  of  the  labour  market.  And interestingly,  as  a  consequence,  both  capital  and  labour  have  tended  to ascribe inferior characteristics to migrant labour to justify their actions.

## Black migrant labour: the British experience

In  Britain,  however,  migrant  labour  differs  from  those  of  the  Western European countries in a number of ways. British capitalism made good its labour shortage, beginning in the mid-1950s, through its continuing relationship with the British Empire Commonwealth. This 'legal legacy' is central  to  black  migrant  labour  in  Britain  in  that  Commonwealth  citizens shared  with  citizens  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  colonies  the  right  to live and  work  in  Britain.  Therefore,  it  was  comparatively  easier  for Commonwealth citizens to sell their labour power in Britain than for Turks and  Greeks,  for  example,  who  were  not  only  'alien',  but  needed  work permits.  Coincidental  with  this  labour  shortage  were  certain  factors  in Commonwealth countries which encouraged black migration to Britain for economic reasons. Indeed in the context of the Caribbean it has been argued powerfully that the trends in migration are governed by factors external to the West Indies? 16

In  the  early  1950s  then,  an  economic  migration  from  the  West  Indies was  followed  by  migration  from  the  Indian  sub-continent. 17 When  this migration  of  labour  to  Britain  is  compared  with  migrant  labour  to  other capitalist countries in Western Europe, certain similarities and dissimilarities emerge. There were similarities, firstly in that their countries of  origin  were  subordinate  in  terms  of  the  world  capitalist  economy;  and secondly, at least, at the beginning of the migration process, the majority of migrant workers were considered to be 'target workers'.

But, in the context of black migrant workers and labour relations, there were important dissimilarities which refer to the politico-ideological relations. Given that most of the migrant labour to Britain came from the New Commonwealth between 1950 and 1968, it is important to note that

the  populations  of  these  countries  were  predominantly  black.  And,  apart from this,  at  least  initially,  migrant  labour  from  the  New  Commonwealth countries  were  not  as  officially  organised  and  recruited  selectively  (with perhaps the exception of the recruitment office set up by London Transport in  Barbados) 18 on  a  contract  basis  as  in  most  of  the  European  Economic Community  countries.  Related  to  this  feature  is  the  fact  that  the  1962 Immigration Act effectively restricted free entry of the New Commonwealth  citizen  from  the  right to live and work  in Britain. Gradually, these rights have been removed to the extent that, since the 1971 Immigration Act, Britain had a contract labour system in line with those of the EEC capitalist formations which has come into effect. 19

This  meant  that  migrants  already  here  in  Britain  before  the  1962 Act were  separated  from  their  dependants  who  did  not  have  the  right  to  live with them in Britain. 20 However, New Commonwealth migrants to Britain during the 1950s and 1960s could, and have settled in Britain. Thus, given its  specificity as a fraction of the working class, it is reproducing itself as part  of  the  working  class,  not  as  migrant  labour,  but  as  black  indigenous labour. 21 Moreover, unlike migrant labour elsewhere in western capitalism, New Commonwealth migrant labour has, theoretically at least, the right of full political participation in electoral politics.

A  closer  look,  however,  is  more  revealing.  Firstly,  there  has  been  a continuing trend of substantial discrimination against black workers in the vital and related areas of employment, housing and services. Indeed, until 1966  discriminators  had  no  legal  constraints.  Thus  legally  disadvantaged black migrant workers were not able to change their subordinate position. There was some attempt through the 1966 and 1968 Race Relations Acts to change this situation, but it was the 1976 Act, on the other hand, which was most effective. 22 Furthermore, evidence suggests that black migrant workers and their children occupy second class status in the process of law enforcement. This refers particularly to section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824 under  which  black  youths  were  prosecuted  on  'Sus'  charges.  Therefore, although  black  migrant  labour  in  Britain  does  not  formally  occupy  a subordinate legal-political situation, it does so in a de facto sense. 23

Economic  aspects  of  black  migrant  labour Among  male  black  workers (excluding African Asians) a 1976 Political and Economic Planning study

found that 42 per cent were in semi - or unskilled jobs, with a further 45 per cent  in  skilled  manual  jobs.  By  comparison,  the  figures  for  male  white workers were 18 and 42 per cent respectively. 24  Among black women 63.5 per cent were engaged in manual work, compared with 45 per cent of white women.

Three  basic  economic  points  need  to  be  made  about  black  migrant labour:

First, not only were black migrants predominantly manual workers, but also  more  than  two-fifths  of  them  were  concentrated  in  semi-skilled  and unskilled jobs. 25

Second,  black  migrant  workers,  apart  from  being  disproportionately concentrated  in  manufacturing  industries,  were  also  in  certain  types  of manufacturing  industry.  Smith  found  that  of  his  sample,  47  per  cent  of black  male  migrants  and  36  per  cent  of  black  women  were  employed  in manufacturing industries, compared with 33 per cent of white males and 25 per  cent  of  white  women. 26 And  within  manufacturing  one  also  found disproportionate numbers of black migrants in shipbuilding, vehicle production,  textiles,  construction  and  food  manufacture. 27 An  analysis  of the  regional  data  showed  a  substantial,  disproportionate  concentration  of black  migrants  in  the  textile  industry  in  Yorkshire  and  Lancashire  and  a lesser concentration in metal manufacture in the Midlands. 28 Further, where black migrants were employed in the service sector of the economy, they were  disproportionately represented in transport and  communications, hotels and catering and the National Health Service, precisely those sectors in which semi - and unskilled labour predominate. 29

Third, those manufacturing industries and services where black migrants  were  concentrated  share  several  (if  not  all)  of  the  following characteristics:  shortage  of  labour,  shift  working,  unsocial  hours,  low  pay and an unpleasant working environment. 30 This list reveals a selfperpetuating situation in that there is a shortage of labour because the work involves unsocial hours, low pay and an unpleasant environment.

Faced  with  a  labour  shortage  then,  employers  in  these  sectors  of  the economy were willing to employ black migrant labour. Thus, in the context of  full  employment  during  the  1950s  and  the  early  1960s,  black  labour served as replacement labour for socially undesirable jobs vacated by white indigenous labour. And finally, there was evidence that the concentration of

black  labour  in  the  manual  working  class  was  being  reproduced  in  part because  of  racial  discrimination.  By  1977,  Smith  was  able  to  show  that there  was  considerable  discrimination  in  both  unskilled  manual  and  nonmanual jobs and also in promotion. The prospects then, as now, are grim. Smith  concluded,  'There  is  little  evidence  that  racial  inequalities  in  the employment field will be quickly corrected by upward mobility of Asians and West Indians.' 31

To  compound  the  problems  of  black  workers,  black  children  born  in Britain and who have completed higher education experience considerable discrimination. In fact, black graduates tend to find jobs commensurate with their qualifications only when there are no well-qualified Whites competing with them. 32 Consequently, it is significant that with limited opportunities, the black working class include not only a substantial proportion of black migrants  with  degrees  obtained  abroad, 33 but  also  the  black  British  who hold  degrees  from  British  universities.  Given  their  economic  position  in Britain,  the  black  working  class,  then  as  now,  clearly  constitute  a  class fraction.

Black  migrant  labour:  racial  categorisation In  addition  to  being  a  class fraction  in  political  and  economic  relations,  black  migrant  labour  also constitutes a class fraction in ideological relations. Historically, the concept of 'race' has tended to come into use when classification of people is made in terms of their physical appearance. Nevertheless following the arrival of black workers in Britain, politicians alerted the public to the 'problem' of the 'races' relating to each other. Thus, 'race relations' has been a thriving concern since the 1950s.

Of  importance  is  the  fact  that  the  significance  attached  to  physical differentiation  could  be  either  positive  or  negative.  Historically,  however, the evidence shows that this significance has been negative for those groups that  were  the  object  of  racial  categorisation.  This,  in  turn,  leads  us  to 'racism' which in this context is used to refer to those negative beliefs of one  group  which  first  identify  and  then  set  apart  another  by  attaching significance 'to some biological or other inherent characteristic(s) which it is said to possess, and which deterministically associate that characteristic(s) with some other (negatively valued) feature(s) or action(s). The possession of these supposed characteristics is then used as justification

for denying that group equal access to material and other resources and/or political rights'. 34

Although racist beliefs can be held about certain groups which are not distinguishable  by  colour,  for  example,  the  hostile  sentiment  in  Britain about  Irish  migrant  workers  and  Jewish  refugees,  one  cannot  ignore  the significance of skin colour to racist beliefs. Indeed, the question of colour formed the basis of the racism articulated from within all classes in Britain since  the  1950s.  Thus,  it  is  the  question  of  'race'  and  the  articulation  of racism  in  Britain  which  places  black  workers  in  a  special  position  in ideological relations. Indeed, the evidence shows that governments, politicians,  neo-fascist  political  organisations,  the  mass  media,  employers, institutions  representing  the  labour  movement  and  sections  of  the  British working class have all acted upon and articulated racist beliefs. In doing so, they have identified black workers as an excluded racial category. 35

Given  then,  that  black  migrant  labour  in  Britain  is  a  fraction  of  the working class, this fraction (which many argue is a sub-class) must be seen in  the  context  that  Britain  is  a  capitalist  social  formation,  which  needed migrant  labour  to  solve  the  labour  shortage  in  certain  sectors  of  the economy. It is against this background that black migrant workers (and their children) have been racially categorised. The first Commonwealth Immigration Act  of  1962  confirmed  this.  Thus  located,  a  whole  range  of racially-biased  forces  came  into  play  in  the  making  of  the  black  working class community.

## The black community: urban deprivation

To a large extent, then, the current size and social characteristics of Britain's black population has been structured by the British government's immigration  legislation.  In  response  to  the  evolution  of  this  socially constructed community, accumulative evidence about racial discrimination and  racial  disadvantage  has  led  governments  to  introduce  not  only  antidiscrimination  legislation,  but  also  a  number  of  initiatives  to  tackle  the steadily  deteriorating  position  of  black  workers  bounded  by  the  decaying urban environment where their homes are located.

Urban deprivation

Between 1961 and 1966 the Census data on employment showed that the main conurbation centres in Britain had very similar industrial structures, and that the changes that were occurring in these industrial structures were very  similar.  This  suggests  that  identical  forces  were  at  work  in  all  the conurbations.  Indeed,  the  similarities  in  the  changes  suggests  that  in searching for theories and explanations, it would be correct to apply these to cities generally rather than treat each city as being unique. 36

In  their  analysis,  Cameron  and  Evans  conclude  that  there  has  been  a tendency in the past for each city to be treated in isolation. This has been particularly  true  of  London.  They  also  suggest  that  the  same  economic forces  had  been  at  work  in  shaping  the  pattern  of  the  central  area  of employment in all conurbations whether they are situated in the prosperous areas  of  England  or  in  the  depressed  areas  of  Scotland  and  the  North  of England.  Further,  the  analysis  showed  that  even  over  the  short  period  of five  years,  employment  in  aggregate  and  in  most  productive  sectors  had been decentralising rapidly from the core of the conurbation and, to a lesser extent, from the central cities to the outer conurbation areas.

In effect, there had been a decline in the working population in all the central  urban  areas  following  a  reduction  in  the  number  employed  in manufacturing industry and the distributive trades. This reflected a general shift  to  tertiary  employment  nationally,  as  well  as  a  decentralisation  of manufacturing industry.

However, in spite of these characteristics in all urban areas, they were not of the same magnitude, nor were they moving at the same pace. In fact, of all these urban areas, London showed the most dramatic contrast. This is reflected in the largest absolute increase in employment in the inner London area in the 1950s, and the largest absolute decrease in the 1960s, while the metropolitan outer ring showed the largest absolute growth in both decades.

This  decline  is  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  between  1966  and  1974, London's total population fell by 9.4 per cent, although the decline in inner boroughs  was  much  greater  at  17.3  per  cent  than  in  the  outer  boroughs. During the same period there was a decline in manufacturing employment of  27  per  cent. 37 It  has  been  argued  that  permanent  factory  closure  and relocation is a more explanatory factor than relocation in London's decline.

Among the reasons put forward for factory closure and relocation were lack  of  space  for  expansion,  large  increases  in  rates  and  rent  and  wage

costs, a shortage of certain types of labour, the impact of the rationalisation of  capital,  nationally  and  internationally,  leading  to  mergers  and  factory closures in order to maintain and improve profitability, and finally government policy which encouraged closure and relocations. 38

This decline seriously affected patterns of unemployment, disadvantage in housing and housing relocation, education, youth service provision and social services of Blacks in the urban centres. Employment is vital to the black workers' fight for survival. Indeed, it is the very reason that the mass of black workers migrated to Britain. Comparison between the migrant and indigenous  population's  patterns  of  employment  illustrate  the  extent  of urban deprivation. 39

The  age  distribution  and  economic  activity  rates  of  ethnic  minorities compared  with  the  rest  of  the  population  clearly  reveal  that  the  ethnic minorities  from  the  New  Commonwealth  are  virtually  absent  among  the retired population of the country. While black workers were fully represented  among  those  employed  above  the  age  of  29,  in  every  age category, they tended to be 'over-represented' among the unemployed.

When employment and unemployment as it affected males and females among  the  ethnic  minority  groups  is compared  with  the  indigenous population, the 1971 Census showed clearly a tendency for both sexes of the ethnic minority workforce to be more economically active than one was led  to  presume,  through  their  representation  in  the  total  population. 40 However, when employment and unemployment are taken into account the over-representation  of  black  workers  is  seen  more  clearly.  For  example, while  both  sexes  were  overrepresented  among  the  employed  and  the unemployed, there was a clear tendency that women were more affected by unemployment  than  men.  This  position  was  worsened  by  the  recession which has had dire consequences for the economy since 1975.

Whatever generalisations have been made so far must now be qualified, since the overall rates for 'ethnic minority' workers  compared  with indigenous workers hide variations between different ethnic groups. Indeed, after considering such variations, a number of differences emerge, reflecting both  the  varying  composition  of  these  groups  in  relation  to  the  total population  and  also  a  tendency  for  some  groups  to  be  more  affected  by unemployment than others.

New Commonwealth-born males tend to be overrepresented among all active males in employment (except in the case of Africans and those from other countries) and West Indian females were overrepresented among all females in employment.  Pakistani women,  on  the  other hand, were underrepresented. Moreover, West Indian women were most overrepresented  among  all  females  in  employment.  Indeed,  they  were highly prone to unemployment; being twice as likely to be out of a job as to be  in  one.  Unemployment,  then,  not  only  tended  to  hit  the  West  Indians harder than any other ethnic group, it also hit the West Indian woman harder than other women workers. 41  Thus, on the question of activity rates, a clear and  systematic  difference  emerged  between  ethnic  minority  workers  as  a group and the indigenous population. In effect, black workers experienced a 'systematic pattern of disadvantage' in employment in that they were (and are)  significantly  more likely to be unemployed than their counterparts in the indigenous population.

However, while these national figures were likely to underestimate the activity rates and the unemployment rates which ethnic minorities experience  in  different  regions  (because  of  uneven  distribution  of  its population),  ethnic  minority  workers  tended  to  concentrate  at  or  near  the centres  of  employment  in  the  urban  areas.  Cross  observed  that  when  this uneven  pattern  of  ethnic  minority  settlement  is  taken  into  account,  the impact of their activity rates and their unemployment rates is exacerbated. Consideration of the settlement patterns and activity rates in conurbations such as Tyneside, West Yorkshire, Merseyside, South East Lancashire, West Midlands, Greater London, Outer Metropolitan Area and Scotland showed that while New Commonwealth-born persons accounted for 2.1 per cent of the total population of Britain, they constituted much larger proportions in some conurbations than in others. Indeed, they constituted 6.4 per cent of the population of Greater London and only 0.6 per cent of the population of Scotland.  Further,  when  the  uneven  distribution  was  compared  to  their activity  rates,  their  unemployment rates in such conurbations (i.e. Greater London, West Midlands and West  Yorkshire) contrast sharply. This suggested a pattern of disadvantage in unemployment which affects ethnic minorities in some conurbations to a greater extent than is reflected in the total populations in these areas. In fact, Greater London, West Midlands and West Yorkshire  figured  among  the  worst  conurbations  for  unemployment among the ethnic minority groups. 42

## Disadvantage in housing and housing allocation

On the question of housing size and dependants, the size of the household is crucial  in  determining  the  kind  of  family  dwelling.  The  1971  Census showed there was a significant difference between the average household size for ethnic minority communities and that of the indigenous population. For  example,  the  average  household  size  for  the  general  population  in England  and  Wales  was  2.8  people.  On  the  other  hand,  the  General Household  Survey  showed  an  average  household  size  of  3.71  for  ethnic minority  communities.  Moreover,  the  PEP  Survey  on  Racial  Minorities (1975) showed 'even larger average figures'. This showed that the average household size for West Indians and Asians was 4.76 but for West Indians the average household size was below this figure (at 4.31) whereas all Asian groups had an average household size of 5.19 persons. 43

Such large families were attributable to two basic factors: firstly that the majority  of  the  ethnic  minority  groups  are  in  the  reproductive  phase. Consequently  there  were  more  children  in  each  household  than  in  the indigenous population. And secondly, these large families were due to the number of  adults  within  them. According  to  the  1971  Census  there  were 2.25  adults  in  each  household.  This  number  was  exceeded  among Asian groups. Few of these adults, however, were over 60 years of age.

The  relatively  lower  levels  of  gross  earnings  among  ethnic  minority workers  reflected  their  marked  concentration  in  low-paid  manual  jobs  as opposed to the better-paid white collar jobs. In this sense, minority workers were (and are) at a clear disadvantage in competing for housing in the open market,  because  this  competition  is  fundamentally  dependent  on  their earnings.

In  1974  poor  black  people  were  in  worse  housing  than  poor  white people.  By  1978,  it  was  clear  that  a  larger  proportion  of  Asians  were borrowing money to buy their houses, and their use of council housing was only one-third of the national average, with very few owning their houses outright. In the changing situation, council renting was decreasing. In fact, the PEP report showed the proportion of West Indian households in council housing as 26 per cent and for Asians as 4 per cent, compared with the 1978 National  Dwelling  and  Housing  Survey  figures  of  45  and  10  per  cent. 44 Indeed, contrary to the claims that black workers take up all 'our' council houses,  it  was  clear  that  neither  West  Indians  nor Asians  were  occupying

council  housing  to  the  extent  that  members  of  the  indigenous  population were.

Home ownership: the financing of owner-occupation A further disadvantage that  black  people face is in obtaining loans to buy their own home. Once again, their disadvantage was (and is) reflected in the fact that Blacks were generally  poorer  than  Whites  and  were  therefore  in  'a  worse  position  to make  the  best  choice'.  Additionally,  Blacks  and  Whites  had  to  face  the policy of 'red-lining' practised by some building societies. In effect, this did not allow mortgages on houses in specified inner city areas, regardless of the  quality  of  the  houses  or  the  ability  to  pay  of  the  mortgage  applicant. While Whites often turned to the local council for a mortgage, most Asians tended to seek a bank loan, which was quicker to get, but involved much higher interest rates. Through this process, Asians were quite often able to buy  houses  with  cash,  thus  arousing  complaints  from  Whites  who  were involved in a much slower process in the housing market.

Council  housing The  1975  Runnymede  Trust  report  showed  that  black people were underrepresented in council housing and that black tenants of the Greater London Council were far more likely to be in pre-war flats in central  London,  while  white  tenants  were  more  likely  to  be  in  the  newer cottage estates. 45

The GLC explained that the report's findings were not that discrimination  had  taken  place  but  that  the  allocation  procedures  were working against rather than for the disadvantaged and the black tenants. In fact, today the homeless (numbering more Blacks than Whites) are in more urgent  need  of  housing;  therefore  they  tend  to  accept  offers  (indeed  the procedures  restrict  the  number  of  rejections  allowed  relative  to  other prospective tenants) forcing them to the 'more available' but 'less desirable' accommodation.  Moreover,  housing  managers,  though  denying  that  they purposely discriminate, admit that, in the interests of speed, white people are often not offered accommodation  on  estates  where  black  people predominate, on the assumption that they will refuse. 46 In effect, the report destroyed  the  myth  that  black  council  tenants  choose  to  congregate  by showing  that  only  about  half  of  GLC  tenants  (black  or  white)  were allocated to the area of their choice.

Another  interesting  aspect  was  the  location  of  housing  for  Britain's black population which was not evenly distributed throughout the country, but  tends  to  be  concentrated  in  many  of  the  large  cities  in  the  major industrial areas. This uneven distribution of the black population was also to be found within cities. The position remains unchanged, if not worse today.

Indeed it is undesirable for any particular group to be concentrated in poor  quality  housing  in  areas  lacking  social  amenities.  A  Department  of Environment  report  showed  that  10  per  cent  of  the  census  enumeration districts housed 70 per cent of the black population. 47 In fact, black people concentrated in certain areas of the cities which are often the poorest ones. Why? It has been argued that some segregation of groups of people was the result  of  the  sort  of  jobs  they  do. An  illustration  of  this  is  that  if  a  large proportion of black people are manual workers, then obviously black people will tend to live in the same areas.

In short, the economic position of Britain's black population is reflected in their housing. Given that they tend to occupy the lower end of the labour market,  black  migrants  could  only  afford  accommodation  which  was relatively  inexpensive.  Thus,  their  housing  was  of  a  poorer  quality  and located  in  less  desirable  'ghetto'  areas.  Underpinning  this  situation  is  the economic position in which black people are placed in British society. This forces an association between them and low standards of housing.

Further, concentrations of black people in rundown areas of the major cities  has  the  effect  of  heaping  blame  on  Blacks  themselves.  Thus  they came to be seen as a cause for the decline in these areas, rather than what in fact  they  were:  the  victims  of  it. 48 To  say  that  black  immigrants  are  the cause of inner city decay is nonsense.

A  number  of  general  programmes  and  policies  were  put  forward  to ameliorate these problems. One policy intended to provide help for black people  through  general  improvements  was  expressed  in  the  1975  White Paper,  'Race  Relations  and  Housing'. 49 Here  no  distinction  was  made  on the  lines  of  colour.  In  the  1977  consultative  document Housing  Policy it was  hoped  that  black  people  would  continue  to  benefit  from  policies designed  to  help  those  in  housing  need. 50 The  document  recognised  that black  people  face  'extra  problems'  in  gaining  access  to  local  authority housing, such as the inability to meet residential qualifications and the size of families not matching the available accommodation.  Further, the

government  acknowledged  that  homelessness  amongst  black  youth  was  a severe  problem  in  the  inner  cities.  Moreover,  it  was  suggested  that  direct involvement  of  the  black  population  (through  self-help  groups)  would  be more likely to achieve success than solutions 'imposed from above'.

Discrimination Commenting  on  a  number  of  reports  that  have  made recommendations about how housing authorities can fulfil their obligation under the 1976 Race Relations Act, the Runnymede Trust and the Radical Statistics Race Group conclude:

One of the more general points to be made from this is that equality cannot  be  guaranteed  simply  by  treating  everyone  in  the  same manner.  Unless  a  housing  authority  considers  the  differences  in needs and circumstances of those on its housing list it will inevitably discriminate against certain groups. Thus in order to ensure equality the  particular  needs  of  black  people  must  be  taken  into  account together with those of other members of the community for whom the authority is responsible. 51

One attempt in redressing the balance was made by Lambeth Council in January  1979  by  announcing  a  target  proportion  of  30  per  cent  of  the housing  on  new  estates  and  modernised  properties  should  be  allocated  to black people on the waiting list.

Incredibly,  keeping  records  of  the  ethnic  origin  of  council  tenants, though strongly advocated, was only recently adopted. Indeed, one of the main reasons for keeping such records was to provide information on how existing  housing  allocation  procedures  do  not  benefit  black  people  to  the same extent as Whites. In fact, indirect discrimination means that Blacks do not benefit as much as Whites because of the characteristics of the criteria itself. The residency requirement, for example, means that unless a person has been resident in the area for a period of time, they cannot register on the housing list. Consequently, black people, particularly Indians and Pakistanis, are less likely to fulfil this requirement, and are thus less likely to  get  council  accommodation.  In  effect,  the  rule  provided  the  means  for this kind of discrimination.

Education

Policy  issues  concerning  ethnic  minority  and  indigenous  pupils  in  school have emerged gradually. Four policy issues have aroused enough concern to indicate  the  extent  of  disadvantage  in  education  among  ethnic  minority groups, compared with the indigenous pupils. These were identified as (i) the issue of the numbers of ethnic minority pupils and their concentrations in  schools;  (ii)  their  language  needs;  (iii)  their  achievement  patterns  and ESN  school placement; and (iv) the impact of the socio-economic background.

Cross  found  that  while  these  issues  have  been  significant  in  policy considerations on a national level, they have not all been equally significant in  every  local  education  authority  area.  Furthermore,  in  the  cases  where some have been significant,  the  degree  of  significance  attributed  to  them varied with the migrant composition of the area. The issue of 'bussing', for instance, although a significant issue nationally was not significant in every local education  authority  because  some  authorities  did  not  adopt  the principle of dispersal by 'bussing'.

Cross  summarises  his  findings  to  conclude  that  the  concentration  of immigrant children in inner city schools is still  a  significant  issue  among decision-makers  and  'bussing'  is  disliked  by  parents  because  of  the  long journey their children have to make to schools far away from their homes. Also of particular concern to decision-makers was that contact between the home and school was inadequate. Parents did not visit the school to discuss the problems of their children with teachers.

It  was also found that among decision-makers there was opposition to changes  in  the  curriculum  designed  to  provide  instruction  in  mother tongues, black studies, single-sex schools and the appointment of black staff as a special consideration of the educational needs of black school children. This  was  in  contrast  to  the parents' wishes,  which  favoured  studies reflecting their cultural and religious backgrounds, and instruction in their mother  tongues.  They  argued  that  teachers  who  shared  their  cultural background would be better able to provide the kinds of instruction required and would also be able to understand the children better. Of course, those who belonged to the assimilationist school would not accept this, adopting the  'when  in  Rome  do  as  the  Romans  do'  approach.  Most  black  parents, however,  were  relatively  satisfied  (47  per  cent)  with  their  children's education,  but  only  10  per  cent  'positively  approved'  of  the  schools

attended by their children, in the main because of the neglected aspects of education in these schools. 52

There is little evidence that government or local authorities anticipated that changes might be required in the education system, following the entry of the children of migrants into British schools. In fact, these children were entering  an  education  system  organised  on  the  assumption  of  cultural homogeneity.  Therefore,  it  was  staffed  by  persons  without  any  training which might prepare them to teach children either born outside Britain, or in Britain, of parents with a distinct culture.

Moreover, the education system, in terms of its staff and many of the books  used,  tended  to  reflect  the  racist  ideology  within  British  society which is essentially a product of Britain's colonial and imperial past. Taken together, these factors have played an important part in creating educational disadvantage  amongst  black  children  greater  than  that  faced  by  white children  in  similar  economic  circumstances.  On  these  grounds  there  is sufficient reason to be concerned.

The  view  that  the  entry  of  black  children  into  British  schools  is  an 'immigrant'  problem  is  clearly  redundant.  Some  40  per  cent  of  the  black population in Britain are British-born. Moreover, the problem lay not with the  children  but  with  the  education  system's  failure  to  react  quickly  and 'intelligently' to a new situation of cultural diversity which was clearly set against  a  background  of  widespread  racial  discrimination.  In  spite  of  the real  problems  arising  from  the  fact  that  the  British  school  population includes children of a different culture, recognition has been slow and little effort has been made to solve these problems.

By 1976, however, some moves were being made. Both the Report of the  Select  Committee  on  Race  Relations  and  Immigration  on  the  West Indian community in 1976 and the Green Paper 'Education in Schools: A Consultative  Document  1977'  have  emphasised  the  need  for  statistical monitoring of pupils, students and teachers. Earlier in 1971, 3.3 per cent of all  pupils  in  maintained  primary  and  secondary  schools  in  England  and Wales were immigrant pupils. More recently, only indirect estimates have been  made  based  on  the  number  of  births  to  women  born  in  the  New Commonwealth and Pakistan. Through this rough guide, the black school population was estimated at 7 per cent of all births by the end of the 1970s. Given  the  uneven  distribution  of  the  black  population,  the  proportion  of black births to indigenous births varied to such an extent that in some areas

black  children  constituted  a  significant  element  in  the  school  population. Surely, this cannot be ignored. Moreover it is essential that the authorities, as policymakers, bear in mind that while people from the New Commonwealth and Pakistan are categorised 'black', they nonetheless have different cultural backgrounds and they also have different experiences and needs.

## The language problem

The hope that black children would learn English through interaction with the indigenous pupils did not materialise. Indeed, as this became increasingly apparent, extra language tuition became a necessity. Even so, the further assumption was made that only children of Indian or Pakistani descent required this tuition. West Indian children, on the other hand, were regarded as having an adequate command of the English language. Thus, the emphasis was placed on teaching English mainly to Asian children.

Although  language  tuition  facilities  were  provided  since  the  early 1960s,  there  was  (and  still  is)  an  acute  shortage  of  skilled  teachers  in English as a second language and of teaching materials. Further, the scale of provision  seemed  to  be  closely  related  neither  to  the  size  of  the  black population, nor to the extent of need. This follows a common trend in both employment and housing. The most common arrangements have been the 'reception  classes'  recommended  in  the  pamphlet English  for  Immigrants by  the  Ministry  of  Education.  According  to  the  Runnymede  Trust,  this method had the advantage of combining intensive training without separation  from  the  school,  so  much  so  that  in  some  schools  the  classes have grown into special English departments.

One area of real concern has been the education of West Indian children. The  patois  spoken  by  West  Indians  in  Britain  (including  those  born  in Britain)  'varies  along  a  patois-standard  English  continuum,  the  balance between  the  two  being  determined  by  the  social  situation'. According  to Edwards (and others) an increasing proportion of West Indian children in Britain  (particularly  teenagers)  are  using  a  form  of  Jamaican  patois  much more exclusively as a response to their feelings of rejection and alienation. 53 Moreover, the argument is maintained that because there is a continuum  between  standard  English  and  patois,  there  is a constant interplay or 'interference' between the two elements. Therefore, this places West Indian children in a disadvantageous position when educated through

the medium of standard English. Thus disadvantages arise because teachers are commonly  unsympathetic  to  the  problems  of  comprehension  and production of standard English faced by West Indian children, often to the extent  that  use  of  patois  is  believed  to  indicate  low  academic  ability. Consequently,  a  process  of  low  teacher  expectation  leading  to  low  pupil performance is set in motion.

## Racism in schools

One effect of the entry of black children into British schools has been to expose the ethnocentric and racist bias in the curriculum and importantly in the  textbooks. 54 For  example,  black  children  are  taught  the  history  and culture of a white society by a white teacher, learning little or nothing of the society  and  culture  from  which  they  and  their  parents  originate.  This implies an 'inferiority' or 'backwardness' of their cultural background. By favouring the teaching of British history without its black contribution, the British  Empire is  legitimised,  thus  maintaining  racist  stereotypes  of  black people.

Through such a curriculum and books, racist ideas are reinforced among white  children,  leading  to  a  negative  self-concept  and  lower  self-esteem among black children. 55  To eliminate this dual effect, a curriculum change is necessary in educating both black and white children.

Teachers' attitude Obviously most teachers in Britain are white. According to  the  Caribbean  Teachers'  Association  by  1979,  0.15  per  cent  of  all teachers were of Caribbean origin. In the mid-1970s, a study of 102 black teachers in London  by  the  Society  for  Immigrant  Teachers  reported discrimination against black teachers. They found that black teachers were concentrated in the 'ghetto areas' and kept on the lowest pay scales. 56

What is equally disturbing is that many educationalists believe teacher expectations can seriously affect their pupils' performance. One study found that although teachers have a positive attitude toward Asian children, they tend to see West Indian children as a problem, particularly in the way they behave  in  the  classroom. 57 Moreover,  the  use  of  patois  leads  teachers  to have  low  expectations  of  West  Indian  pupils.  Further,  not  only  do  some teachers  believe  in  racist  stereotypes,  they  also  'incorrectly'  believe  that white pupils do not hold racist beliefs. Consequently, they are incapable of making an explicit effort to challenge racist beliefs at school.

Underachievement? The  issue  of  underachievement  or  'low  performance' of black children in British schools brings together the issues of language, curriculum and teachers' attitudes. 'Underachievement' has been identified and  linked  primarily  with  West  Indian  children  which  implies  that Asian children are not 'underachieving'.

Apart from reading ability, there is evidence on such issues as school placement  and  examination  results  which  show  the  disadvantage  of  West Indian children in the British education system. This evidence relates to the numbers and proportions of West Indian children assigned to the educationally subnormal schools. In 1972 West Indian children accounted for  1.1  per  cent  of  all  children  in  state  schools  and  4.9  per  cent  of  all children in ESN schools. 58

Of major importance is the fact that educational underachievement and overrepresentation  in  ESN  schools  have  wider  implications  that  vitally affect  the  black  working  class.  The  evidence  shows  that  the  material  and emotional  circumstances  of  family/home  life  which  are  dependent  on  the level  of  income  (among  other  things)  substantially  affect  the  educational achievement of black children. 59 It follows then, that as the parents of black children are disadvantaged in the jobs they do and the quality of housing they occupy, there is also a tendency for their children to be disadvantaged within  the  educational  system  because  of  these  factors.  Thus,  material disadvantage  is  compounded  by  the  insistent  effects  of  racism  and  racial discrimination.

Given that material disadvantages are also shared relatively by the rest of the British working class, West Indian families are particularly disadvantaged in terms of nursery provisions.

While the shortage of provision for the nursery and day care facilities for  the  under-fives  has  been  a  recurrent  problem  for  most  parents,  those living in the most deprived areas are particularly affected. Working mothers and single parents are among the most needy.

All the evidence amassed and the arguments put forward led to certain government  responses  towards  the  education  of  black  children.  The  first official  response  was  educational  advice  in  1963  through  a  Ministry  of Education  pamphlet 60   pointing  out  the  need  for  an  intensive  course  of teaching English as a second language at primary and secondary schools, at a time when there were virtually no trained teachers in English as a second

language,  nor  were  there teaching materials. 61 Further, the pamphlet generally advised on educational arrangements for immigrant pupils.

Circular 1/65 was  issued in 1965  inviting local authorities with substantial  numbers  of  immigrant  pupils  to  apply  for  increases  in  their teacher quota.

Another  Circular  (7/65,  issued  in  June  1965)  recommended  that  the proportion of immigrant pupils in any one school should not exceed 30 per cent of the total. Government support reflected thinking which had nothing to do with a multi-racial society. The government felt that an increase in the proportion  of  immigrant  children  in  a  school  or  class  increased  the problems  and  would  become  more  difficult  to  solve,  and  the  chances  of assimilation  would  become  more  remote.  In  spite  of  the  argument  for 'dispersal' based on educational need, it was mainly black pupils who were dispersed,  thus  incurring  a  further  disadvantage!  Later  that  year,  a  White Paper Immigration  from  the  Commonwealth put  forward  a  multi-purpose policy, which it hoped would integrate immigrant children, both to prevent a fall in school standards and to assist in the organisation of special English classes.

Thus a contradiction resulted between the pamphlet English for Immigrants and  Circular  7/65  and  the  White  Paper Immigration  from the Commonwealth . While  the  first  aimed  at  bringing  together  immigrant children for English classes in one school, the White Paper suggested that although the teaching of English was a goal, 'such arrangements can more easily be made, and the integration of the immigrants more easily achieved, if the proportion of the immigrant children in a school is not allowed to rise too high'. 62 The significance of this contradiction was stressed rather than the pressing language need. Thus, it was correctly argued that the bogey had not  been  discrimination  -  less  favourable  treatment  -  but  concentration. This  brought  condemnation  not  because  it  might  lead  to  less  favourable treatment,  but  more  often  than  not  because  it  was  perceived  as  the development of 'foreign enclaves within British culture and society'. 63

So, it was on the grounds of origin rather than educational need that the Department  of  Education  and  Science  emphasised  the  policy  of  dispersal which  led  to  six  local  authorities  (Ealing,  Bradford,  West  Bromwich, Halifax, Huddersfield and Hounslow) implementing dispersal by 'bussing' black children to other schools. Such authorities as the ILEA  and

Birmingham  rejected  it,  while  others,  who  found  it  impractical  to  keep within the suggested 30 per cent limit, abandoned the idea.

In addition to the government machinery, independent organisations and pressure groups have been set up. For example, the National Association for Multi-Racial  Education  (NAME)  established  in  1965,  initially  concerned with the needs of black school children, broadened its concern to include the educational needs of British children as a whole. This essential thrust of the  organisation  was  to  campaign  for  changes  in  the  educational  system which will facilitate the development of a multi-ethnic society. 64

## Youth Service provision

Sir John Maude defended the formal objective of the Youth Service thus:

To offer individual young people in their leisure time opportunities of various kinds, complementary to those of home, formal education and work, to discover and develop their personal resources of body, mind and spirit and thus to better equip themselves to live the life of mature creative and responsible members of a free society. 65

These  were  very  high  ideals.  Indeed,  'to  live  the  life  of  a  mature, creative and responsible member of a free society' brings into sharp relief reports about the community and delinquency of young people in general, but  particularly  black  youth.  In  fact,  the  politics  of  'mugging'  is  the backdrop against which the disadvantages of ethnic minority adolescents in terms of youth service provision can be illustrated.

If the demand for youth facilities is partly a function of the proportions of  adolescents  in  the  country  aged  between  14  and  20  years,  then  it  is necessary  to  consider  the  major  disparities  between  the  proportions  of indigenous adolescents in this age group and those of the ethnic minority communities.  These  disparities  influence  their  relative  'need'  for  youth facilities, apart from the question as to whether this need is adequately met.

The  children  of  ethnic  minority  people  constitute  3.0  per  cent  of  all those  in  the  total  population  between  the  ages  of  11-20  years.  From  the evidence, these children are almost three times as likely to fall within the age-group  compared  to  those  of  UK  parentage.  Having  considered  the figures,  Cross  argued  that  the  logic  would  suggest  that  three  adolescents from ethnic  minority  groups  should  be  making  use  of  youth  facilities  for

every one indigenous youth who does so, 'all things being equal'. Indeed, the proportion of those who  require such facilities and who  were (statistically speaking) more likely to use them was nonetheless still large at 9.4  per  cent. 66 But,  to  what  extent  do  they  use  them?  In  spite  of  the difficulty with data, the indications available from a few surveys suggests that fewer ethnic minority adolescents were involved in youth facilities than their  statistical  representation  in  the  age  categories  of  14-20  years  would lead  one  to  expect.  In  Bradford,  for  example,  in  1966  relatively  few adolescents from ethnic minorities were involved in youth club activities. In fact, the few that were members attended regularly and participated in club activities in much the same way as other club members. Clearly, the youth service holds little appeal for most adolescents today. In effect, it has failed to appeal to ethnic minority groups.

One of the reasons advanced for its failure concerns the nature of the immigrant  communities  themselves  and  their  cultural  patterns  of  control over  their  adolescent  children.  For  example,  Asian  parents  are  not  only strict about participation of girls in mixed activities, but also impose dietary and  other  restrictions  to  both  sexes.  Moreover,  the  strong  family  ties pressurise  some  Asian  adolescents  to  seek  social  and  leisure  activities within their own group, in spite of their fluency of English.

Even  among West  Indians  (though  they  are  less  inclined  to  object  to their  daughters  being  involved  in  mixed  youth  clubs)  there  has  been  a tendency  to  maintain  strong  discipline  over  the  activities  of  girls  and  the hours they spend from home. Interestingly there has been greater success in the  recruitment  of  ethnic  minorities  by  such  youth  organisations  as  the Junior  Red  Cross,  Boy  Scouts,  Girl  Guides,  Boys  Brigade  and  church groups involving, in the main, West Indian youth. This is due partly to their parents'  familiarity  with  these  organisations  before  arrival  in  Britain,  and partly  because  of  the  appeal  of  the  uniforms  and  ideologies  of  these organisations. West Indian church organisations have also been particularly successful in recruiting West Indian youth.

Another  factor  in  explaining  why  adolescents  from  minority  groups have not used the youth service as much as their numbers would lead one to expect  concerns  their  changing  demographic  characteristics  before  1966 and between 1966 and 1971. Before 1966 the proportions of ethnic minority adolescents  falling  into  the  14-20-year-old  group  was  smaller  than  it  has become since. According to the Hunt report estimate, they constituted some

2 per cent of those who were between 14 and 20 years of age in 1966. As this proportion increased to 3 per cent it became a matter of some concern to policy-makers following publication of the Hunt report and the Circular 8/67 which followed it. 67

## Health and social services

According to the Runnymede Trust and the Radical Statistics Race Group there appears to be some evidence that the black population, particularly the Asian  population  does  have  special  needs. 67 These  are  mainly  concerned with diseases and conditions associated with dietary deficiencies and child health.

Additionally, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research study  concluded  that  'largely  because  of  their  age  structure,  immigrant families make smaller demands on the Health Services than other families, and this is likely to hold true for some time to come'. 68

A  number  of  areas  of  disadvantage  facing  black  people  in  their relationship with the social services have been identified by the Community Relations  Commission.  Firstly,  there  is  the  problem  of  communication. Language  differences  and  proficiency  have  serious  implications  for  the dissemination of information by social services and health departments. Yet, it is argued, the language barrier has not been acknowledged constructively. 69 Secondly,  there is the question of children in care. Considerable evidence supports the fact that a disproportionate number of children  in  care  are  black.  A  London  Borough  of  Wandsworth  survey carried out in 1973-74 showed that 48 per cent of all children received into care were of West Indian origin. Moreover, they tended to be younger than white children in care. 70 Accompanying this high number of black children in care is a shortage of foster parents, particularly black foster parents.

In dealing  with  this  problem,  nine  London  boroughs  initiated  an experimental  fostering  campaign  in  1975-76  of  black  parents  for  black children. The campaign was aimed at playing an educative role in informing black people of the difficulties of black children in care and in helping to bridge  the  gap  between  black  people  and  social  work  agencies. 71 These initiatives, however, were not the norm.

Further, elderly black people have special problems. While the number and  proportion  of  elderly  black  people  is  gradually  increasing,  a  report

produced by Age Concern in 1974 found that while the needs of the black elderly were similar to those of the general population, they have additional needs resulting from racial discrimination, differences in culture, insecurity in an alien environment, remoteness from friends and relatives and a sense of isolation. 72 Further, these factors have implication for the services which local authorities provide; for example, day centres, meals on wheels and old people's  homes,  among  others.  Justifiably,  the  complaint  is  made  that special  provisions  are  rarely  made.  Indeed,  one  local  authority  refused  to support  an  Urban  Aid  application  to  provide  for  elderly  Asians,  on  the grounds that separate provisions were not compatible with their policy. 73

Finally,  urgent  consideration needs to be given to one-parent families. The West Indian population has a particularly high incidence of one-parent families. In fact, the General Household Survey 1972 reported that 13 per cent  of West Indian households were comprised of single-parent families, compared with  9  per  cent  in  the  general  population. Apart  from  this,  the extent of full-time female employment in minority groups probably leads to a greater demand  for pre-school day-care provision from the black population than from the general population.

Taken together then, it is suggested that certain groups of black people are  disproportionately  represented  or  pose  new  issues  within  the  existing traditional  categories  of  need  used  by  the  social  services.  Overall,  the available  evidence  points  to  the  fact  that  'the  response  of  social  service departments  to  the  existence  of  multiracial  communities  has  been  patchy, piecemeal and lacking in strategy'. 74

## 9 The Black Workers' Industrial Struggle

## Industrial relations: the colonial context

By the time that British immigration control began with legislation in 1962, a  number  of  colonial  trade  unions  had  emerged  to  lead  the  struggle  for national independence. Given the violent mass demonstrations by exploited, low paid colonial workers, the colonial government found it necessary to channel  labour  protest  into  a  viable  and  acceptable  organisation  which would not disrupt the continued exploitation of the agricultural, mineral and labour  resources  of  these  colonies.  In  the  interest  of  capital  then,  British Colonial  Office  policy  was  geared  towards  passing  legislation  to  legalise workers'  organisations through  the formation  of trade unions  in the colonies,  based  essentially  on  the  British  model.  Guidelines  were  sought from the more developed and sophisticated parts of the Empire. Although the territories of European settlements, namely Australia and Canada, were 'far  too  different'  from  the  poorer  tropical  territories,  much  attention  was focused on the codes of law and administrative practices developed in India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka), which went into the making of model legislation for the dependencies.

The social tensions arising from exploitation of native colonial labour, not  surprisingly,  progressively  gave  cause  for  concern  to  the  Colonial Office. It saw the need for reforms, through labour legislation, in order to forestall disruptions  to  the  smooth  flow  of  production  in  the  mines, plantations  and  communications  network,  owned  and  controlled  by  the major  multinational  corporations.  Thinking  in  the  Colonial  Office  was regarded as being 'more advanced' and 'more progressive' than in colonial governments and among the local vested interests.

The view of Empire of the stalwart trade unionist and Foreign Minister, Ernest  Bevin,  among  others  was,  in  fact,  well  known.  Not  surprisingly, therefore, the development of trade unions in the colonies was a typical part of the process of the 'transmission of institutions'.

In varying degrees then, trade unionism was introduced to the colonies, some of which were becoming less purely agricultural and more a complex of agricultural/industrial economies. This led to a certain amount of labour displacement  which  became  largely  redundant.  Given  the  ownership  and control  of the major  plantations  and  mines,  for  example,  by  British American, Canadian and South African companies, it was imperative that a system of industrial relations should develop. Indeed, this is precisely what happened. According to one expert the evolution of industrial relations in the  tropical  territories  was  closely  related  to  the  development  of  the dominant form of employment. Since there was no one type of employment, in most cases different kinds of employers co-existed. Firstly, there  was  the  government  official,  the  settler  and  native  farmer,  hotelkeeper,  tailor  and  craftsman,  among  others,  who  employed  a  number  of workers. Secondly, large plantations offered employment in some territories drawing  on  migrant  workers.  And  thirdly,  government  services  offered clerical employment. 1

Prior to the emergence  of  trade  unions, workers  expressed  their discontent by producing less, through absenteeism, high turnover rates and occasionally  by  spontaneous,  and  at  times,  violent  demonstrations  of protest. Usually such demonstrations resulted in a quick and hostile colonial response to put down such protests, but did nothing to deal with the factors underlying the essential discontent.

This  phase  of  industrial  relations  was  experienced  by  all  colonial territories before trade unions received recognition as providing the necessary machinery to deal with workers' grievances. Clearly, the imperial

government could not ignore the spontaneous, mass demonstrations of low wage-earners labouring under deplorable conditions throughout the colonial Empire.  Before  trade  unionism  then,  mass  demonstrations  often  led  to 'riots',  and of course, the well-known British official response of a Royal Commission  to  investigate  the  causes  and  make  recommendations.  In effect,  this  was  to  do  little  or  nothing  to  remove  the  fundamental  causes. With the outbreak of labour unrest in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s (prior to independence in most of these territories) generally unsympathetic employers heaped the blame of unrest on 'agitators' and 'political adventurers', carefully excluding themselves from all responsibility.

Amidst  growing  discontent,  by  1950,  attempts  were  made  to  set  up consultative  machinery,  through  joint  consultation.  During  this  decade collective bargaining was also evident in some territories in East and West Africa.  Government  intrusion  had  made  industrial  relations  particularly 'stormy'. Security forces, deployed to maintain law and order, were more concerned  with  protecting  the  lives  and  property  of  the  vested  interests, namely the employers. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, the West Indian, Asian and African territories were all beset by this partisanship.

A  change  in  the  crude  pattern  of  industrial  relations  came  with  the growth  in the working  population, increasing urbanisation, industrial development,  advancing  education,  the  rising  political  consciousness  of workers  and  an  intense  growth  of  nationalist  movements.  The  combined effect  of  these  factors  provided  the  stimulus  for  the  adoption  of  laws regulating industrial relations on the British model. A fundamental requirement was the statutory setting up of a Labour Department.

As  employers,  colonial  governments  were  asked  to  (and  took)  the initiative by setting up Whitley Councils and where there was no collective bargaining, with advice from London, passed protective legislation, including acts to regulate recruiting, contracts of service, payments in kind, the  hours  of  work  of  women  and  children,  workmen's  compensation  and minimum  legislation.  During  the  Second  World  War,  minimum  wage machinery was especially necessary to counteract the steadily rising cost of living.  The  Labour  Departments  were  charged  with  the  major  role  of administering these policies initiated in London.  Moreover,  in  some colonies,  Joint  Industrial  Councils  were  established  on  the  British  model with the object of promoting good relations between antagonistic employers

and  the  emergent  trade  unions.  Further,  labour  advisory  committees  were set up. 2

Collective  bargaining  was  also  introduced  between  1950  and  1962  as part  of  the  developing  industrial  relations.  Although  it  was  difficult  to determine  the  proportion  of  the  workforce  in  every  territory  covered  by collective agreements, in some territories such as Barbados and a number of other  West  Indian  colonies  most  wage-earners  worked  under  conditions established by collective bargaining. In African territories and in Mauritius, working conditions were also determined by collective bargaining.

The  scope  and  content  of  these  collective  agreements  reflect  some measure of the development of the industrial relations system in the tropical Commonwealth territories. Union recognition, initially refused by employers,  gradually  became  a  common  practice  as  employers,  albeit reluctantly,  agreed  to  accept  trade  union  membership  as  a  right  of  the employees to be written into a collective agreement. Bargaining, however, differed  from  the  United  Kingdom  experience,  in  that  the  granting  of bargaining rights to one union for the entire labour force in a firm, or an industry (the normal practice in the United States) was practised in many cases.

Although agricultural workers have been difficult to organise, collective bargaining  has  nonetheless  been  in  operation  for  many  years  between unions and employers on the sugar plantations in the West Indies, the rubber plantations  in  Malaya  and  the  banana  plantations  in  West  Africa.  Trade union rights were confined however. Indeed, the right of union officials to enter estates for the purpose of organising the workers employed had been a major  point  of  contention.  In  spite  of  access  agreements,  the  prerogative remained with the employer.

Employers  sometimes  found  it  expedient  to  agree  to  closed  shop agreements with the union, as was the case between the Grenada Seamen and Waterfront Workers Union and Geest Industries Ltd.  This agreement 3 brought the union into collaboration with the company for the appointment of  the  chief  stevedore,  whose  duties  included  engaging  labour  for  the loading and discharge of ships, and the organisation of this work.

Another form of departure from the British practice of trade unions (the collection  of  their  own  contributions  by  a  branch  officer)  was  the  'check

off' system, which followed the American practice. This system entailed the deduction of union contributions from the pay packets of employees.

Redundancy agreements (predictably new to collective bargaining) had become  endemic  in  colonial  terms  of  employment.  This  facilitated  the designs  of  the  expatriate  owners,  the  multinational  barons  whose  cost effective  criteria  led  to  hiring  and  firing  at  will.  However  phased  these payments were (always of course to alleviate the labourers' distress) the fact remained that the worker had become redundant.

Employers were unwilling to concede more to the trade unions than was necessary.  Indeed,  capital  was  aided  by  the  fact  that  the  unions  were,  in most  cases,  inefficiently  organised.  The  divide  and  rule  strategy  created tribal, racial and political divisions among the mass of workers.

Local labour and nationalist organisations used the emergence of trade unions as a means through which they could further assert (at least legally) their demands for independence. Prior to political independence, low wages were seen as the by-product of colonial rule. With the end of crown colony government,  working  class  expectations  were  unduly  raised,  only  to  be faced with the stark realities of neo-colonialism.

The growing impoverishment of the former colonial dependencies (in the neo-colonial era) has led to growing economic dependence on Britain. High unemployment provided the necessary cheap source of labour for the British  economy. As  a  result,  black  workers  entered  the  lower  end  of  the occupational hierarchy in Britain. 4

## Racial disadvantage in employment

The popular stereotypes of black workers as being shiftless, lazy, and living off social security must be challenged. For far from being 'work shy', it was argued  that  minorities  in  Britain  have  been,  in  general,  'more  industrious than  white  people'.  In  fact,  apart  from  the  single  exception  of  Moslem women  (many  of  whom  were  prevented  from  going  to  work  by  cultural factors) the proportion at work, by 1977, was the same or higher among all minority groups than among comparable white groups. 5

In  this  comparison,  the  age  factor  is  important  since  far  more  whites than the minorities are above retiring age. Moreover, there were far more black working mothers than white. In addition, full-time rather than part-

time work was more the norm among Asian and West Indian women than among women generally.

On  the  question  of  black  unemployment,  it  was  found  that  as  total unemployment rises, the minorities tend to make up a greater proportion of this  total.  More  particularly,  one  survey  has  shown  'very  high  levels'  of unemployment among young people and women within the Asian and West Indian communities. 6

The  job  levels  of  Blacks  were  also  affected  with  those  of  Asian  and West Indian men being substantially lower than those of white men. In fact, the gap between Pakistanis and Whites was the widest, followed by West Indians  and  Indians.  Indeed,  Pakistanis  were  particularly  disadvantaged. 7 Significantly, it was  found that the minority groups had penetrated comparatively  little  into  non-manual  jobs  such  as  the  professional  or management  positions.  Generally,  however,  all  the  minority  groups  were more concentrated than Whites in semi-skilled and unskilled manual jobs. Pakistanis  were  poorly  placed  in  that  20  per  cent  of  them  were  in  the poorest, unskilled manual jobs, compared with 6 per cent of Whites.

Commenting  on  minority  men  with  qualifications  to  degree  standard, Smith  found  that  79  per  cent  of  the  white  men  were  in  professional  or management positions compared to only 31 per cent of minority men, and that 21 per cent of minority men with degree-standard qualifications were doing  manual  jobs,  whereas  none  of  the  white  men  with  equivalent qualifications were doing manual jobs of any kind. 8 Put simply, Asians and West Indians faced the greatest difficulties in trying to enter the better nonmanual jobs. The explanation that inadequate English is responsible for the low  job  levels  of  Asian  men  is  unfounded  for  'there  is  a  very  strong relationship  between  fluency  in  English  and  academic  qualifications  -  so strong, in fact, that nearly all Asian men with degree-equivalent qualifications speak English fluently. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of them are doing manual jobs'. 9  Furthermore, among West Indian, Indian and African Asian women, job levels were lower than for white women. It was  also  found  that  in  regions  containing  the  main  concentrations  of Pakistanis (Yorkshire, Humberside and the North-West) there were comparatively high proportions of minority men doing unskilled or semiskilled manual  jobs  and  comparatively  low  proportions  doing  skilled manual jobs.

## Shift work and earnings

Not  surprisingly,  black  workers  had  to  do  shift  work  as  the  only  means through which low basic earnings could be supplemented. It was found that 15  per  cent  of  white  men  worked  shifts  often  hours  or  more  per  week, compared with 31 per cent of minority men. Shift work was most common among Pakistanis, African Asians, West Indians and Indians. In the textile industry, for example, Pakistanis were engaged in a 'very high level' of shift working. Thus, because of their economically weak position and language difficulties, employers exploited Asians to the hilt, using them particularly to do jobs involving unsocial hours.

Given  that  the  job  levels  of  the  minority  groups  were  (and  are) substantially lower than those of the white population, how low were their earnings from those jobs? Comparing white and minority men at each job level,  it  was  found  that  at  the  higher  level,  Whites  earned  'substantially more'  than  the  minorities;  at  the  middle  levels,  they  earned  'about  the same'; and at the lower levels, the minorities earned 'more' than Whites. 10

In  sum  then,  the  earnings  of  minority  men  were  lower  than  those  of Whites. Indeed, the use of Asians and West Indians for unskilled and semiskilled  shiftwork  was  a  form  of  exploitation.  Moreover,  while  academic qualifications were actually of little value to Blacks in enabling them to get better  jobs,  they  were  extremely  valuable  to  Whites.  Further,  while  the earnings of minority and white women were much the same, there was an enormous disparity between the sexes. 11

## Employment and recruitment

In relating the gap between the minorities and Whites, at the workplace, it is vital to look at the policies and practices of employers. Before examining these  policies  and  practices,  however,  we  should  look  briefly  at  the distribution of the minority workforce by type of industry.

Between the indigenous population and the minority groups, there were marked differences in the types of industry in which they worked. How did the minorities come to work in certain industries? Although the process is complex, a few basic assumptions can be made.

According  to  Smith,  one  of  the  main  features  by  1977,  was  that  a relatively high proportion of the minority groups worked in manufacturing industry (47 per cent of minority men, compared with 33 per cent of white

men), probably because this  industry  used  a  relatively  high  proportion  of unskilled  and  semi-skilled  labour  and  the  minorities  were  concentrated  in this kind  of  job.  Transport  and  communications  was  the  one  service industry  with  a  relatively  high  proportion  of  workers  from  the  minority groups - some 13 per cent of minority men compared with 9 per cent of all men. Transport  and  communications  was  one  of  the  service  industries  in which semi-skilled and unskilled labour was concentrated.

The  minorities  tended  to  work  in  those  industries  where  there  was  a high demand for cheap, unskilled or semi-skilled labour. Indeed, a relatively high proportion of black workers were to be found in vehicle manufacture and  transport  and  communications.  By  contrast,  there  were  fewer  black workers in agriculture and in paper and printing and publishing, where the demand for labour was relatively low.

Furthermore,  there  was  a  high  concentration  of  Asians  (particularly Pakistanis) in the textile industry, in spite of the fact that agriculture was the main area of employment in their country of origin. While Pakistanis were concentrated in the textile industry (62 per cent of Pakistanis in Yorkshire and Humberside, compared with only 6 per cent of Whites and in the NorthWest  52  per  cent  of  Pakistanis  compared  to  5  per  cent  of  the  white population)  both  Indians  and  Pakistanis  constituted  a  high  proportion  of those  employed  in  vehicle  manufacture  -  12  per  cent  in  each  case, compared with 4 per cent of the white population. More particularly, Sikhs predominated, constituting 16 per cent. On  the other hand, a high proportion  of  West  Indians  were  working  in  professional  and  scientific services; many were employed in secretarial and other white-collar jobs in the National Health Service.

Among Asians, the facts do not bear out the popular view of them as shopkeepers. Apart from African Asians, the proportion of all the minority groups working in the distributive trades was relatively low by 1977. The African Asian accounted for 15 per cent, compared with 13 per cent of the whole workforce. Further it was found to be untrue that a high proportion of Asians  were  controlling  small  businesses  of  various  kinds,  such  as  shops and restaurants. While self-employed white men accounted for 12 per cent of  the  working  population,  the  proportion  was lower among  the  minority groups: 8 per cent of Asian working men and 6 per cent of West Indian were self-employed. 12

## Concentrations within particular plants

While it is fairly predictable that concentration of minorities will tend to be higher among plants in high concentration areas than in the low concentration areas, nevertheless, within each group of areas, there was still a  wide  spread  of  plants  with  different  concentrations.  In  fact,  in  the  high density  areas,  where  the average concentration  of  minority  workers  was over 13 per cent, 19 per cent of plants employed only Whites, and a total of 38  per  cent  employed  less  than  4  per  cent.  Conversely,  even  in  the  low density  areas,  where  the  average  concentration  of  minority  workers  was 4.36 per cent, 12 per cent of plants had workforces which accounted for at least 10 per cent from minority groups. 13

Thus,  the  evidence  reflected  a  polarisation  between  those  plants  that employed and those that did not employ minority workers. Interestingly, in the  majority  of  cases,  the  plants  that  had  employed  few  or  no  minority workers had not employed any significant number of them in the past.

In  effect,  then,  there  were  many  all-white  plants  and  many  with  high concentration of Asians and West Indians. Given this uneven distribution of black  workers  across  plants,  what  role  did  these  plants  play?  And  what policies and practices did they adopt?

The number of minority job applicants received by plants had been used to  define  this  role.  The  basic  finding  showed  that  plants  generally  tended very strongly to give preference to white applicants. Moreover, it was found that Asians and West Indians had to make about twice as many applications as  a  white  applicant  before  employment.  Asians  and  West  Indians  fared worst at both ends of the employment scale, when applying for both nonskilled and non-manual jobs.

## Racial discrimination in employment

Given that the minority groups are more vulnerable to unemployment than the white population (for a number of reasons) 14 they have to make twice as many applications as Whites before finding a job. Indeed, it was found that racial discrimination is an important factor in the situation.

The  PEP  Report  of  1977  demonstrated  very  clearly  the  existence  of 'very  substantial  racial  discrimination  against  Asians  and  West  Indians when seeking manual jobs and that discrimination is worse for non-skilled

than  for  skilled  job  applicants'. 15 This  discrimination  was  based  on  a 'general  colour  prejudice'  which  does  not  distinguish  between  people  of different racial groups with different religions, speaking different languages and coming from different countries. They tended to be all lumped together as 'coloured people'. 16

The  results  of  correspondence  testing  showed  that  Asian  and  West Indian applicants for white-collar jobs were discriminated against in 30 per cent of cases, compared with only 10 per cent for Italian applicants.

Bearing  in  mind  that  the  method  employed  identified  discrimination only at the screening stage, a level of 30 per cent is very substantial. Smith argued that if nearly one-third of Asian and West Indian applicants failed to get  an  interview  because  of  discrimination,  we  should  expect  an  even higher proportion to fall by the wayside, as a result of unfair treatment by the time a selection is finally made. Indeed, the very much lower figure for Italian  applicants  showed  that  discrimination  in  manual  jobs  was  based largely on colour prejudice.

## The black workers' experience of discrimination

Among  white  working  men  76  per  cent  thought  that  at  least  some employers discriminate unfairly against minority job applicants. Similarly, 74  per  cent  of  West  Indian  men  held  the  same  view. Among Asian  men, however,  the  proportion  was  markedly  lower  at  47  per  cent.  Clearly, discrimination in recruitment was (and is) widespread, pointing up the fact that awareness of discrimination generally was actually higher among white men (and West Indians) than among some of the affected Asians; while a smaller proportion of Asian women  believed that some employers discriminated  (31  per  cent),  it  was  found  that  West  Indian  women  held similar views to their menfolk. 17 In effect, then, the 'passive or compliant' attitude among Asian women was not present among West Indian women.

On a personal level, the proportion claiming discrimination in recruitment was low among West Indians and Asian men, ranging between 14  and  16  per  cent,  and  very  low  among  Asian  women,  3  per  cent. Significantly,  this  reinforces  the  point  that  those  who  were  discriminated against were not usually aware of it.

What  had  emerged  clearly  from  the  findings  was  a  reflection  of  the general attitude and orientation of the Asian and West Indian communities

(given that West Indians were no more aware of discrimination than Whites, and Asians even less aware of it) which instead of being over-sensitive to any signs of unfair treatment and resentful of their position in relation to the host  community  and  militant  for  change,  the  minority  groups  were  often very slow to recognise an injustice which affected them most closely.

Clearly  then,  the existence  of  racial discrimination  was  generally recognised by the white population. Thus, it was argued, public opinion was ready to accept the relevance of policies to doubt discrimination, in spite of the  fact  that  people  may  have  regarded  this  as  either  a  low  priority  or believed that discrimination was (and is) inevitable or necessary.

People's  awareness  of  discrimination,  it  was  reported,  was  strongly influenced by their general attitudes and way of life. Indeed, the culturally enclosed Asians provided the clearest example of this in that those who do not speak English well, 'are much less aware of discrimination, and claim less personal experience of it, than the more  outgoing  middle-class element'. Therefore, culturally enclosed Asians were less alive to personal discrimination  (since  they  ventured  little  outside  their  communities)  and were  less  concerned  about  it  because  their  orientation  was  with  other Asians, rather than with Whites.

In effect then, racial discrimination reinforced this cultural confinement, by discouraging contacts outside the communities. Paradoxically, however, discrimination had the effect of encouraging a pattern of life among Asians which  made  them  unaware  of  the  central  significance  of  discrimination itself.

Among both Asians and West Indian informants who had been refused a job because of race or colour, it was found that in a substantial proportion of cases, the applicant had reasonable grounds for thinking that discrimination had  occurred.  Interestingly,  it  was  found  that  among  Asians  and  West Indians who believed that employers discriminated, only a minority could relate  a  personal  experience  of  discrimination.  Indeed,  although  direct evidence  was  hard  to  come  by,  they  had  'good  general  reasons'  for believing there was discrimination.

Any comparison of awareness and experience of discrimination, must take  into  consideration  that  any  change  of  opinion  does  not  refer  to  the same  set  of  ethnic  minority  people.  In  fact,  earlier  and  later  arrivals  of immigrants have different  opinions.  For  example,  among Asian  and West Indian men who arrived in Britain from 1970 onwards, only 37 per cent felt

that  some  employers  discriminated.  In  contrast,  63  per  cent  of  those  who came  up  to  June  1962,  believed  this  to  be  the  case. 18 Both  waves  of immigrants  reflected  different  experiences.  Those  long-settled  immigrants faced 'open and accepted' discrimination, while recent arrivals (without this experience) were less likely to be aware of the true extent of discrimination.

## Policies and practices of employers

A survey of employers showed that policies to combat discrimination were least common in those plants that employed few minority group workers, or none at all. Moreover, plants with 500 or more workers were twice as likely as smaller ones to have taken steps to prevent discrimination. The general feeling among employers was that there was no need for a policy because it was assumed that there was no discrimination.

The majority of management informants (64 per cent) thought the 1968 Race Relations Act had made  little difference to race relations in employment, while 19 per cent felt it had good effect and 16 per cent a bad effect. Moreover, while a substantial proportion of informants (40 per cent) thought the minorities were better off as a result of the Act, only 3 per cent thought  they  were  actually  worse  off.  The  remainder  thought  that  the legislation made no difference.

Furthermore, only 5 per cent of plants had changed their policies and practices because of the Act, while 19 per cent of the large plants with at least 500  employees  had  made  changes. 19   A  more  difficult  problem concerned employee relations and the nature of white resistance. Employers may be reluctant to prevent discrimination in recruitment because they fear the  consequences  of  a  large  number  of Asians  and  West  Indians  in  their workforce. Indeed, such factors may be based on the racial prejudices of the employers or managers themselves.

Overall,  the  effect  on  industrial  relations  of  employing  members  of minority  groups  into  the  workforce  was  'slight'  and  did  not  provide reasonable ground for the reluctance of employers to introduce policies of equal opportunity. Indeed, this trend was in line with the existing state of industrial relations. In fact, the fear among  white  employees  of  the employment of Asians and West Indians and equal opportunity policy was also a reason given by trade unions for not adopting more positive policies.

Moreover,  it  was  found  that  a  high  proportion  of  large  plants  had complaints from white workers, and complaints were more often than not

made where Asians rather than West Indians constituted the main minority group.  This  latter  point  is  important  in  reflecting  the  cultural  disparity between  Asians  and  Whites.  The  general  conclusion  however,  was  that resistance from white workers to the employment of racial minorities was 'not particularly common'. 20 Nevertheless, the resistance that did occur in a substantial minority of cases most emphatically cannot be ignored. Indeed, this problem can be compounded when strong views about Asians and West Indians are expressed by some managers.

## Job mobility, job satisfaction, promotion and supervision

It  was found that the firms which had already employed large numbers of Asians and West Indians received more applications from these groups than other firms. This resulted in a concentration of minorities which tended to increase in those firms employing them. Significantly, also, one is reminded of the fact that minorities tended to avoid firms that did not employ people from  their  own  group.  Indeed,  most Asian  and  West  Indian  men  (58  per cent)  had  never  applied  for  a  job  without  prior  knowledge  that  the  firm employed Asians and West Indians.

Between white workers and minorities, the important difference in jobseeking  was  that  Asian  and  West  Indian  manual  workers,  seeking  semiskilled and unskilled jobs, applied directly to the factory gate, rather than reply  to  an  advertisement.  This  approach  was  adopted  by  47  per  cent  of minority men, compared with only 20 per cent of white workers who found their jobs by direct application.

Given  the  above  findings,  one  would  suppose  that  Asians  and  West Indians would  be  dissatisfied with their jobs, become  impatient  for promotion and be constantly on the look out for a better position. On the contrary, the evidence, at the time, showed that they accepted their position with 'equanimity'.

One  explanation  was  that  this  was  a  reflection  of  the  informants' expectations  as  much  as  the  nature  of  the  job.  The  boring  and  repetitive nature  of  the  jobs  has  had  an  overall  depressing  effect  on  the  ethnic minorities  who  felt  their  chances  of  a  better  job  were  slim.  Therefore, (although  the  desire  was  strong)  they  had  no  grand  schemes  to  become Chairman of the Board or indeed, making it to one of the line manager's positions. The hard reality of their lives, under oppressive racial discrimination, had engendered this unhappy existence.

According to Smith, the minorities 'are not actively discontented, and there  is  no  dynamic,  at  present,  for  a  strong  political  movement'.  He reasoned  that  it  may  be  that  most  adult Asian  and  West  Indian  migrants, having achieved a substantial improvement in their standard of living since they arrived in Britain become  'satisfied' with their dead-end jobs, particularly by comparing their position in Britain with that in their country of origin. Indeed, the majority of migrants who arrived in Britain during the 1950s and early 1960s were strongly influenced by the idea of an eventual return  home.  We  must  not  however  assume  that  the  immigrants  were satisfied. In 1977, Smith has argued that 'the more they come into contact with the white majority, the more they will tend to see themselves as part of the  mainstream;  this  will  lead  to  a  shift  of  their  point  of  reference,  to  a change of attitude, and to a new kind of evaluation of their own position in Britain.'  Seven  years  later,  in  1984,  this  'new  kind  of  evaluation  of  their own  position  in  Britain'  has  clearly  led  to  a  'change  of  attitude'  but certainly not 'as part of the mainstream'.

Nevertheless, the evidence showed  that, of the minority groups, Pakistanis who did the least desirable jobs for the worst pay, still showed the highest level of job satisfaction. This had been attributed to them being the  'most  culturally  enclosed'  group,  adopting  the  'narrowest  frame  of reference'. 21

It is as well to remind ourselves at this stage, that most Asians and West Indians were satisfied with their jobs and that a majority also believed that many employers practised  racial  discrimination. Against  this  background, how did they see themselves in relation to promotion and supervision?

Among minority men 29 per cent would like to have been promoted, compared  with  22  per  cent  of  white  men.  But  how  did Asians  and  West Indians rate their chances of promotion? Thirty-eight per cent of minority men considered their prospects of promotion as good, compared to 42 per cent of white men.

As was the case in job satisfaction, both the desire for promotion and the  expectation  of  getting  it  were  least  strong  among  Pakistanis.  In  fact, only  19  per  cent  thought  their  promotion  prospects  were  good  compared with 39 per cent of the other minority groups combined. More particularly Indians and African Asians were most likely not to want promotion, but also to consider their prospects as 'good'. Further, poor English speakers neither wanted nor expected to get promotion. This was in line with the thinking of

Pakistanis  confirming  the  view  that  culturally  enclosed  Asians  took  a narrow frame of reference.

An inhibiting factor in the promotion of Asians and West Indians was (and still is) the feeling among employers that it was dangerous to promote minority  workers  to  positions  which  necessitate  supervision  of  white workers. Put simply, although the gap between the minority and Whites was substantial, nevertheless there were minority workers in supervisory posts with responsibility for white and minority workers.

Among  the  few  employers  who  appointed  Asian  or  West  Indian supervisors, there had been remarkably few difficulties. In fact, only 5 per cent said this led to any problems; 95 per cent definitely stated that it had not. While 3 per cent thought it impossible that white workers would adjust to  this  situation,  the  majority  (60  per  cent)  thought  the  adjustment  was immediate and the remainder said it took a few weeks (32 per cent) or a year (5 per cent). In spite of these encouraging developments, the stark fact was that the majority of plants (78 per cent) had yet to take this step. These plants  were  inhibited  by  the  belief  that  the  appointment  of  minority supervisors would create problems.

Overall, the evidence reflected a distinct contrast between the extent of the problems actually experienced by plants with minority group supervisors and the problems expected by those not employing them. Only 31 per cent of those with none thought that they would be resisted by white workers. 22 While  these  findings  relate  to  supervision  of  manual  workers, exactly  the  same  conclusion  was  reached  following  a  similar  set  of questions about supervision of white-collar workers.

Given the similarity of the job levels of those who came to Britain up to 1962 and afterwards - the earlier arrivals tended to be West Indians and to be less qualified than the more recent arrivals who tended to be Asians - it is likely that the earlier arrivals may have moved up the job scale to some extent  since  coming  to  Britain.  If  indeed  this  was  the  case,  they  are  still doing substantially  poorer  jobs  than Whites,  even  after  a  degree  of  token 'upward mobility'. The concentration of the minorities to 'dead-end' jobs is not  a  temporary  phenomenon.  On  the  contrary,  those  who  had  been  in Britain for twelve years, and considerably longer, were (and still are) doing jobs substantially inferior to those of Whites.

## The struggle against the employers and trade unions

## Strikes

According to Knowles, 'one cannot agitate successfully without widespread grievances'. 23 For black workers in British industry during the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, there certainly was no shortage of grievances. These years constituted a period  of rapid changes  in  industrial organisation.  The growing size and complexity of production units and their greater interdependence (through multinational corporations) and the rate of technological change demands planning and co-ordination from the centre. Thus,  the  tensions  generated  by  strikes  between  groups  of  workers,  shop stewards  and  formal  trade  union  machinery  resulting  in  strikes  (be  they unofficial  or  unconstitutional),  though  essentially  a  management  problem, is, in the last analysis, very much a government problem. It was within this context  that  black  workers  took  action  during  the  period.  Many  of  these strikes  revealed  the  entrenched  positions  adopted  by  employers,  white workers  and  the  trade  unions  towards  black  workers.  In  effect,  black workers'  grievances  challenged  the  unrealistic  containment  of  conflict  in certain  industries.  Moreover  they  challenged  (and  in  some  cases  proved) racism at all levels of the industrial structure.

## The strike at Courtaulds

Some firms openly practised discrimination against black workers. Others (the  more 'enlightened' managements) adopted the 'soft glove' technique. Both, however, inevitably had to face the problem of increasing productivity  and  profit,  and  the  resistance  of  black  workers  who  were drawn into devious schemes to achieve these targets. Prolonged exploitation led to inevitable reaction.

In May 1965 one of the first important 'immigrant' strikes took place at Courtaulds Red Scar Mill in Preston over management's decision to force Asian workers (who were crammed with a few West Indians, into one area of the labour process) to man more machines for proportionately less pay. This  first  skirmish  has  become  a  landmark  in  black  labour  history  in Britain. The weaving firm, Red Scar, used chemical processes in making its products. Workers in the Tyre Cord Spinning Department supervised a bank

of spindles on a machine. Not surprisingly, throughout 1964 Courtaulds was seeking improved productivity from its plants and in the person representing management at Red Scar duly negotiated (without consultation with the workers) a deal with the regional organiser of the Transport and General Workers' Union. Thus, a devious deal was struck. After signing an agreement, the union official told the shop stewards (only one of whom was Asian) to convene a meeting and get the workers to accept supervision of one and a half machines instead of the existing one. The financial reward for  this  was  a  ten  shilling  bonus  a  week.  Incensed  by  this,  the  workers called  a  meeting  with  the  union's  regional  organiser  who  was  asked  to explain his 'agreement' with Red Scar management. His attempt to explain his  indefensible  action  was  jeered.  The  workers  drew  his  attention  to  the fact that the agreement meant a 50 per cent increase in output for a 3 per cent increase in their wage! 24

Needless  to  say,  they  voted  against  the  new  proposals.  Consequently, the plan to increase productivity at the expense of disproportionate wages, an unviable proposition in the face of unanimous black workers' resistance, was shelved for a month.

This brief respite was ominous. The ever resourceful capitalist cunning was put into operation. Without warning, the workers on the afternoon shift were  suddenly  confronted  with  new  work  allocations.  The  line  managers moved in  with  red  paint  and  brushes  and  drew  boundary  lines  along  the machines  dividing  them  into  halves.  Each  worker  was  now  allocated  the supervision of 1 ½ machines. The men promptly refused and staged a sit-in to  management's  astonishment.  This  action  resulted  in  machines  being clogged. There was chaos for 17 hours. In their final act of solidarity that day, the black workers, most of them Indians and Pakistanis, walked out.

They went on strike for three days. Predictably, the TGWU Chairman at the  factory,  Richard  Roberts,  immediately  began  a  campaign  to  get  the strikers back to work, before any negotiations could begin. Clearly he was sympathetic  to  management's  threat  that  they  would  not  negotiate  under duress. After all, he was the link man, the mediator, the 'responsible' trade union leader. He could not therefore be seen to be disruptive of the smooth operation of the firm's policy objectives. In short, the trade union officials had to be experts at man-management (for example, keeping workers within the  established  norms  of  productivity),  an  approach  welcomed  by  the employer who saw human beings only in terms of labour cost.

Revealing his, and clearly the trade union hierarchy's position, Roberts told the press that the strike was 'unofficial' and 'racial'. He told Paul Foot, the journalist, 'I could have said it was 'tribal' but that might have been a bit unfair.' 25 Playing 'unfair' then was not outside the bounds of possibility in  official  trade  union  thinking.  Uncharacteristic  of  a  'responsible'  trade unionist, one might add.

Regardless of his and the union's views, the strikers had been through a painful experience.  Though  disorganised  (and  lacking  in  trade  union experience)  they  were  resolute,  staying  out  until  mid-June.  During  this period,  with  no  'precept  or  precedent'  they  made  attempts  to  organise themselves. They were further disadvantaged by the fact that they had 'no recourse  to  a  black  movement  equipped  to  mobilise  the  assistance  they needed to win'. In disarray, and vulnerable, the pressures were indeed great. Early in June, the 120 West Indians involved in the action returned to work after  a  'pep  talk'  about  'responsible  behaviour'  by  representatives  of  the West Indian High Commission who  had called a 'strike meeting'. Ultimately,  the  strike  failed  but  not  before  it  had  exposed  the  active collaboration of the white workers and the union with management.

The strike at Red Scar nevertheless was significant. For the first time in the industrial struggle of Asian workers, the black movement made a well publicised  intervention  during  which  Roy  Sawh  and  Michael  de  Freitas (Michael  X)  of  the  Racial  Adjustment  Action  Society  (RAAS)  made statements. While Sawh called for a separate union of Blacks, De Freitas later said that although he was against white people 'he was not for separate unions'.  In  spite  of  the  publicity  focused  on  the  dispute  because  of  the intervention of the two RAAS speakers, the workers listened to these two militant West Indians, applauded their spirit and laughed at their anti-white jokes, 'but couldn't take them or their organisation as serious channels of industrial struggle. It was apparent to the workers from the beginning, that Michael X would bring them publicity in the quality Sunday papers, but no more.  RAAS  had  no  experience  with  mobilising  an  independent  black revolutionary force in Britain, and didn't seem to the workers as capable of analysing the issue of the strike, let alone mobilising national or international support for it.' 26

When the Red Scar strike had ended, there was no shortage of views from reporters. John Torode advocated an educational drive by the union of

their  Asian  workforces  in  order  to  avoid  strikes. 27 But  would  this  alone alleviate the workers plight? Paul Foot, the socialist, felt 'If the Red Scar strike shocks management and unions into greater care over communication with and promotion of immigrant workers its consequences may not be as disastrous as they once threatened to be.' 28

What is revealing is the fact that although the strike was fought by the immigrant workers (with the crucial support of the Asian community and in particular, the Indian Workers Association) they failed to win against their oppressive employers, because of the lack of official union support.

## The Imperial Typewriters strike

By 1974 a clear pattern had emerged. Indeed, the 'apotheosis of racism' and the 'resistance to it' was reached during the strike at Imperial Typewriters in Leicester.  Significantly,  this  firm  was  a  subsidiary  of  the  multinational Litton Industries. 29

The  trade  union's  position  in  this  strike  was  revealed  by  the  TGWU negotiator, George Bromley, a JP, 'stalwart of the Leicester Labour Party', and one of the 'lieutenants of capital'.

The workers have not followed the proper disputes procedure. They have no legitimate grievances and it's difficult  to  know  what  they want. I think there are racial tensions, but they are not between the whites and coloureds. The tensions are between those Asians from the  sub-continent  and  those  from  Africa.  This  is  not  an  isolated incident, these things will continue for many years to come. But in a civilised society, the majority view will prevail. Some people must learn how things are done … 30

In referring to the tensions between African and Indian Asians, Bromley totally ignored the racial tensions that already existed between the Whites and Blacks as a direct result of a large National Front presence in Leicester. Indeed the NF had polled 9000 votes in the previous elections. They were concerned about Communists as was Bromley who felt the strike was being led  by  professional  agitators.  He  argued  that  they  wanted  a  change  in society, to take over and control the union machinery. But since they could not do it from outside, they were being supported by Chinese Communist

money. 'I've had reports of money,' he said, 'of £5 notes changing hands on the picket line …' 31

Bromley's comments reflected a greater readiness to understand management's desire to  maintain  exploitation  of  the  predominantly Asian workforce at the existing level. His lame excuse that these Asian members of his union had 'no legitimate grievances and it's difficult to know what they want', was copping out of his official responsibility. Whose side was Bromley really on in this major industrial dispute involving Asian workers? Was he unaware of the ownership and control of Imperial Typewriters? A little background to this company is necessary in order to set this dispute in its proper context.

Established  in  1908,  Imperial  Typewriters  had  by  1960  achieved  an annual profit of £571,000. Its Leicester base was extended to premises in Hull.  However,  profits  were  not  maintained  at  this  level  throughout  the 1960s.  In  fact,  there  was  a  down-turn  through  the  decade  because  of 'foreign competition'. In 1965, for example, annual profit fell to £360,000 and  by  1966  it  was  down  to  £267,000.  The  company's  shares  at  a  book value of 23/- in 1960 dropped to 16/3 in 1966. The prosperity of the small firm throughout the 1950s was now a thing of the past. The international depredations of monopoly capital had made their impact.

The  growing  and  expanding  multinational  Litton  industries,  based  in Delaware  in  the  United  States,  sought  access  to  ever  cheaper  labour  and new markets. The growing difficulties of the British firm made it easy for take over. Consequently Litton industries moved in on the British scene in 1961  dealing  in  London  office  machinery.  By  1966,  as  a  producer  of 'Royal'  typewriters  in  the  United  States,  it  was  poised  to  move  into  the British typewriter market. During the year, Litton made a bid for Imperial Typewriters, at a share price of 16/3. Eventually, for a total price of £1.9 million,  Litton  bought  100  per  cent  control  of  a  business  whose  property assets  alone  were  valued  at  £1.7  million.  Given  a  growing  pool  of  cheap East African Asian labour there was reason to be optimistic.

At  the  time,  Litton  International  was  the  second  largest  typewriter company  in  the  world,  with  a  controlling  interest  in  Olympic  business machines, and Triumph and Adler typewriters. In 1972, the company owned 267 major manufacturing plants and laboratories and 1393 factories in 31 countries.  Its  interests  extended  to  building  the  navigation  and  control

systems of the United States Army, Air Force and Navy. Also in 1972, the company's annual turnover was $2,476,623,000.

It was  therefore,  not  surprising  that  Litton's  control  over  Imperial Typewriters  had  wider  implications.  Soon  much  of  its  production  was moved to Europe. Having installed new machinery and generally updated its  production  operations  in  Leicester  and  Hull,  the  number  of  workers employed by IT doubled, from 1,900 in 1968 to 3,800 in 1972. Interestingly, until 1968, Imperial's employees were all white. Thereafter, it was  noticeable  that  recruitment  was  centred  largely  on  Asian  workers. Productivity of these migrant workers brought about a turnover which more than trebled between 1968 and 1972 from £3,346,000 to £10,762,000. The surplus value per worker during this period reached more than 50 per cent, and since 1972, although productivity 'increased enormously' bonus levels were  re-negotiated  downwards. 32   To  further  reduce  labour  costs,  more women were employed. Black workers had made a fundamental contribution to the firm's success, yet their grievances were ignored. After all,  Asian  women  workers  were  regarded  by  multinational  employers  as passive.

When  the  Asian  workers  turned  to  their  union  for  help,  they  soon realised  the  true  nature  of  the  union's  role.  They  were  reminded  by  their union negotiator of the need to keep the company as a going concern. He wrote to the strikers: 'You are ill-led and have done nothing but harm to the company, the union and yourselves.' 33

The  strategy  of  using  fear  of  unemployment  was  resorted  to  at  every opportunity  to  keep  these  workers  in  passive  servitude.  Of  the  1600 employed at the Leicester factory, approximately 1100 were Asians. As they became impatient with their grievances being ignored, it became clear that there  was  an  unholy  alliance  between  the  union  full-time  official  and  the employers' representative.

As the politics of Litton International was being played out, the Asian labour force, bought on the cheap, were pawns in the game. Even so, there was a limit to depression.

The  rumblings  came  to  a  head  on  May  Day  (the  day  of  international working class solidarity) when workers from four firms in Leicester took action.  The  walkout  involved  300  workers  at  the  British  United  Shoe Machinery; 300 at the Bentley Group, 200 at the General Electric Company

factory  in  Whetstone,  and  39  Asian  workers  who  left  section  61  of Imperial's factory. The substantial numbers engaged in the walkout action from  the  first  three  firms  soon  walked  back  to  work.  In  spite  of  this psychological disadvantage the majority of those workers who walked out from Imperial's factory stayed out, and managed to bring out a further 500 workers with them. This withdrawal of labour had the desired effect: within a few days production fell to 50 per cent of normal and fell much further as the strike entered its fifth week. 34

The Asian workers had struck because of a deep feeling; the cumulative effect over a long period of 'economic wrong doing' and racial exploitation. At the beginning of the strike, the main issues were about bonus rates and producing progressively, first 16, 18, 20 then 22 machines every day for the same wages. But, as the strike evolved, a host of related grievances became integral. Moreover, the strike was about racism reflected in the election of shop stewards and the preferential treatment for white workers who could clock in their mates, while Asians were not allowed to do so. Further, the strike was about the 'dignity of human beings, the right to go to the doctor when they were ill or to take time off to look after their children'. 35

The  strikers  demanded  their  own  shop  steward  to  be  elected  by  their section,  who  would  not  just  negotiate  on  the  question  of  production  and bonuses, but also on all the important restrictions that made up their daily working  lives  compared  to  those  of  white  workers  -  washing  time,  tea breaks, lunch breaks, toilet breaks, and so on.

In  the  course  of  their  demands  to  Reg  Weaver,  the  TGWU  factory convenor,  they  found  out  that  although  they  were  being  paid  bonus  on  a target  of  200  or  more,  they  were  in  fact  entitled  to  bonus  on  168  (an agreement which dated back to 1972, and would have meant an extra £4 per week). 36 It  was this discovery, heaped on top of management's oppressive organisation of production, that sparked-off their revolt.

Having  walked  out,  the  manner  in  which  the  strikers  picketed  and conducted themselves, and the strategies and creativity they brought to bear on  the  struggle  were  instructive.  It  seemed  clear  to  them  that  traditional, hidebound  British  trade  unionism  could  not  cope  with  their  legitimate workplace problems. As the strike escalated into a major industrial dispute, the Asian workers from East Africa brought, as one commentator put it, 'a vivacity and style to it that makes it unique'.

Between 50 to 200 workers manned the picket line continuously. 37  The women workers played a central role. They engaged in a 'fearful howling and hollering', whenever a scab or representative of management appeared. Tremendous noise (echoing down the street) was an outstanding characteristic and an effective factor in the picketing. The myth of the Asian woman's  passivity  was  debunked  as  her  presence  was  not  only  felt,  but heard. These women showed great courage. In the midst of their isolation, the odds against them seemed even greater.

In  spite  of  the  ubiquitous  presence  of  the  police,  the  immovable unsupportive position of the union (in refusing to make the strike official) and  the  hostility  of  the  employer  and  the  indigenous  working  class,  the Asian strikers on the picket line remained undaunted. As the struggle wore on, Asian youth increasingly became a part of the strike scene. Others took an  intermediate  position.  One  East African Asian  served  as  a  go-between (interpreter) between the Asian strikers and his fellow-policemen. Needless to say, he was taunted and made the target, especially of Asian youths. As the struggle gathered momentum, there were other spin-offs.

The emergence of Asian youths in  the  struggle  worried  state  officials who  were  already  faced  with  controlling  West  Indian  youth.  Later  this would have implications on social policy. Together, these youths, with no background of employment experience and no real work prospects in the foreseeable future had little to lose by demonstrating the plight of the black working  class.  Their  parents'  struggle  had,  in  effect  become  theirs,  a family/communal affair.

By the third day of the strike, the strikers from section 61, who had been led by women workers announced that Hasmukh Khetani and N. C. Patel were  their  unofficial  leaders.  The  women  leafletted  and  picketed  the relevant sections of the factory and were joined by 500 other workers for a meeting in Spinney Hill Park at which the original strikers demanded that 'their  bonus,  out  of  which  they  had  been  fiddled,  should  be  backdated  to January 1973, and that new rates should now be negotiated on the basis of their present position'.

As  the  strikers  gained  more  support  from  people  in  the  factory,  their collective power and resolve grew. Thus fortified, they demanded an end to the  use  of  racialism  by  management  to  divide  workers;  they  called  for democratic  elections  in  the  trade  union  and  reiterated  their  demand  for backdated bonus payments. Sensing the strikers' implacable resistance to its

malpractices,  the  company's  response  was  positive  and  predictable.  The original  strikers  were  notified  that  they  would  be  sacked  if  they  did  not return  to  work.  In  the  ensuing  deadlock  third  parties  intervened.  Tom Bradley,  the  local  MP  and  President  of  the  Transport  Salaried  Staffs Association tried to get the workers back to work. He said: 'I told the strike leaders they were getting nowhere by walking the streets and urged them to adopt the proper procedure by returning to work and resuming discussions under an independent Chairman.' 38  This was trite nonsense, for after many months  of  complaining,  their  reasonable  'discussions'  through  the  proper procedure got 'nowhere' in the factory.

Bradley, however, was not alone. He was supported by Reg Weaver, the local  TGWU  convenor.  Predictably,  these  gestures  were  rejected  by  the strikers,  who  stood  by  their  demands. They  would  not  be  tricked  back  to work. In fact, they injected a broader perspective in the struggle, by calling on 'all workers, men and women, black and white'. Indeed, all who worked at Imperial.

By the end of the first week of the strike, on 7 May, the effectiveness of the strike was evident. The factory was down to 50 per cent of its normal production, and more than 500 workers were on strike. In this unprecedented action, the workers were out on a limb. But, they were free from  the  bureaucratic  trappings  (rules  and  regulations  which  had  not anticipated  or  considered  their  introduction  into  the  British  workforce)  of trade union organisation. Freed from these trammels, the workers invented new ways and means of achieving a more effective strike organisation to further  their  cause.  Thus,  the  'grievance  meeting',  a  mass  meeting  of  the strikers  came  into  being.  Individuals  expressed  their  grievances  and  the salient issues arising from these taped interviews were co-ordinated into a series of demands by the central Strike Committee. Thus, a close bond was forged between the strikers and their leadership. As the confidence of the rank and file grew, so too did the number of militants.

Nine days after the strike started, the company sacked 75 of the original strikers.  In  protest  against  this  action,  the  workers  refused  their  cards. Instead, they sent them back. Was this cheekiness on their part? Or was the initial act of dismissal an insult to their integrity? Moreover, they formulated a list of demands to be negotiated with the company. Although the  company was 'willing to talk', Reg Weaver, feeling that his authority had been undermined, hindered the process. He said he was not ready to

talk  to  any  but  the  strikers'  leaders.  In  his  diligence  to  undermine  the strikers, Bromley conveniently discovered a TGWU rule to the effect that workers could not be elected as shop stewards until they had been at the factory  for  two  years.  While  this  kind  of  shop  floor  democracy  was  later repudiated by Jack Jones, the Union's General Secretary, it never occurred to Weaver that perhaps a change in the rule (or more accurately, facing trade union racism) might be necessary.

As  the  mass  picketings  and  demonstrations  intensified,  police  were called in. But things had already gone too far. Aware of the task confronting them, the strikers appealed to workers in other factories represented by the same branch of the TGWU. Four factories with large Asian memberships aided the strikers with donations to the strike fund and pledged a 24-hour stoppage at their factories 'if and when needed'. Significantly, at that point in the struggle, 'race and a sense of community' constituted the vital power base  of  the  strikers.  Still,  the  rest  of  the  Leicester  white  working  class remained  unmoved.  The  strikers  were  determined  to  demonstrate  their commitment and sense of solidarity in the hope of winning crucial support from other workers.

On Sunday 19 May, the Strike Committee called a mass meeting and 2000 people demonstrated through Highfield. Three weeks after the strike, factory production had 'slowed to a trickle', and six workers faced fines of £315 for obstruction and assault on the police. With little positive support from  the  labour  movement,  the  Race  Relations  Board  intervened.  They were  invited  by  Benny  Bunsee,  a  South  African  Asian  who  had  helped Asian workers in an earlier strike. But although the Board's intention was to carry  out  a  preliminary  investigation,  which  was  welcomed  by  the  union officials  and  factory  management,  the  strikers  were  sceptical.  Given  the urgency of their demands, they felt this intervention would lapse into a slow and  tardy  process,  and  more  importantly,  it  was  unlikely  to  meet  their demands.

The  Board's  intervention  came  as  no  surprise.  George  Bromley  had been a founder member of the East Midlands Conciliation Committee on the  Board.  According  to  one  report,  he  had  resigned  due  to  pressure  of work. The Board's intervention, however, was timely. By the end of May the  strike  had  begun  to  take  its  toll.  Most  of  the  strikers  were  officially sacked  by  Imperial  Typewriters  and  were  therefore  ineligible  for  social security. In these circumstances, a long drawn out inquiry was the last thing

these  courageous Asians needed. As far as they were concerned the Race Relations Board was 'a toothless Bulldog'. However, attempts at intervention to end the strike continued. At that point, David Stephens's (of the  Runnymede Trust) proposal of the intervention of Michael Foot (then Minister  of  Employment)  was  also  ignored. 39 Fundamentally,  the  strike continued. The picketing was maintained and the grievance meetings were held  regularly.  Individual  grievances  were  voiced  and  the  nuances  of discontent shored up the central issues which remained in the foreground of the strikers' minds, thus maintaining the strike's momentum.

As  the  strike  entered  its  tenth  week,  forced  by  the  creativity  and solidarity  of  the  Asian  workforce,  Bromley  retreated  from  a  'position  of rational collaboration with capital into the realms of social fantasy'.

The amateurs were now regarded as 'professional agitators'. As far as Bromley  was  concerned,  the  strikers  should  go  back  to  work  and  reach some  agreement  according  to  the  rule  book.  For  the  strikers,  however, having endured a wageless 10-week struggle (during which substantial hire purchase debts were defaulted) there would be no return without victory.

The preposterous idea of Chinese Communist money was regarded as a sick joke. In fact, the strikers were desperate for money. On this question of money, support came from the community and political organisations and meetings. For example, the Birmingham Sikh Temple contributed £125, the Southall IWA  £50,  the  Birmingham  Anti-Racist  Committee  £14,  the European  Immigrant  Workers  Action  Committee  £12  and  the  Edinburgh Women's Conference £40. While the needs of the strikers were amounting to large sums of money weekly, such contributions as were made came to them in 'dribs and drabs'. 40

Heaped  on  the  financial problem  was  the  combined  pressure  of management  manipulation,  alleged  union  collaboration  with  them,  and  a constant  barrage  of  racist  propaganda  from  the  Leicester  branch  of  the National Front. In the face of all this, the strikers stayed out.

This  was  an  extraordinary  strike.  Whereas  an  'ordinary  strike'  would have  collapsed  within  days  because  of  an  initial  lack  of  commitment  by workers  or  a  lack  of  union  support,  or  both,  the  strikers  at  Imperial Typewriters responded with a strength and creativity which would help to shape  the  future  of  the  black  working  class  struggle.  Free  from  the unprogressive  traditions  of  British  trade  union  bureaucracy,  and  newly

proletarianised after leaving East Africa, and the Indian sub-continent, the Asian strikers brought certain notable qualities to their struggle: a spirit, an approach  and  a  willingness  to  try  any  tactic.  This  experience  of  migrant workers  provided  lessons,  particularly  for  the  trade  unions  and  the  wider labour movement.

The TGWU, supposedly an organisation of the working class in fighting against  capital,  was  exposed  as  a  vehicle  for  the  further  accumulation  of capital.  Indeed  this  had  been  the  case  in  earlier  disputes;  for  example, Woolf's and Rock ware Glass in West London in 1965, Malmic Lace, E. E. Jaffe, Jones Stroud, British Celanese and Harwood Cash in 1973, Perivale Gutterman, and Coventry Art Castings.

Interestingly,  the  black  migrant  workers  chose  to  remain  within  the framework of the union (in spite of alleged 'communist' infiltration) in the hope of getting union support for their demands. Instead, the union set up an inquiry to look into the conduct of Bromley and Weaver, and their role in Litton International's dealings. No strike and no ex-officio payments were forthcoming. Still hopeful the strikers welcomed the union inquiry. While the  inquiry  was  being  conducted,  mindful  of  the  role  of  colonial  Royal Commissioners, the strikers became disenchanted. Put simply, their positive feelings were to 'Throw the bastards out'.

One  of  the  outstanding  problems  to  be  settled  was  the  question  of strikers'  leader,  Benny  Bunsee,  the  'outsider'  labelled  by  Bromley  as  an agitator.  The  strikers  were  opposed  to  the  dumping  of  Bunsee.  Brian Mather, one of the members of the inquiry team told a reporter, 'Its purely an industrial issue, but there are forces at work trying to escalate it such as the National Front. … There is a language problem of course. And George Bromley,  the  local  officer  has  been  personally  and  perhaps  emotionally involved.' 41

One of the most significant factors to emerge from the strike was the fact that in spite of the shabby treatment of these Asian workers over many weeks, they continued to defend the union. 'We have a high regard for what the union can achieve once it is determined to flex its muscles and to take up the genuine grievances of the workers. But for this to happen the trade union  officials must  be  responsive  to  the  genuine  grievances  of  the members.'

This became a recurrent theme among black working class organisers. As the strike dragged on, the central power base increasingly became the independent  intervention  of  Asian  women.  Of  vital  importance  to  this strike, and others (and underlying it all), was the question of the role of the union and the common experiences of the vast majority of black workers in Britain. This raises many important questions. For instance, when the IWA unionises a complete foundry and then hands over the membership to the TGWU, is that really the best way forward for black workers? And why the dichotomy between black and white members of the union and Bromley's role  in  it;  and  more  fundamentally  was  there  a  racist  ramp  among  white workers on the shop floor and elsewhere in British society?

When the  Imperial  Typewriter  factory  closed  for  two  weeks'  holiday, picketing was suspended. However, the struggle continued with the strikers maintaining contact with each other, essentially through lectures, discussion groups  and  two  evening  concerts. They  persisted  in  seeking TGWU  rank and file support nationally, sending letters to branches all over the country. Furthermore, they called for a national solidarity committee, coordinated by Race Today , 'to collect money, to circulate information, to organise pickets on Litton's branches across the globe, to support the pickets and to involve Asian workers and all workers in active support for the struggle'.

But foremost in their mind at all stages in the strike was the hope that the TGWU would make the strike official. This was a vain hope. Finally they lost their  jobs  as  Litton  industries  decided  to  close  down  the  factory rather  than  make  even  the  minimum  concession  to  the  strikers'  demands. And  since  the  union  did  little  to  prevent  this,  it  must  be  implicated  as contributing to this end. Indeed, race emerged as the major divisive issue within the British working class.

In the aftermath, the strike's casualties were counted. By the end of July 1974, management issued notices sacking most of the strikers. Nine arrests were made on the picket line and the struggle was directed to London where 200  workers  lobbied  Transport  House  (the  Labour  Party  headquarters)  to make the strike official. Instead of badly needed support, they got a promise of an inquiry by Jack Jones and Moss Evans of the TGWU. In effect, the disowned strikers were left to struggle on their own. The wider trade union and  labour  movement  remained  largely  deaf  to  the  appeals  of  the  Asian workers.

Lessons  of  the  strike This  strike  showed  (i)  how  the  Imperial  Typewriter factory  at  Leicester,  a  'cog  in  the  multinational  corporation  wheel',  was used as a meeting point of cheap labour and access to markets; (ii) how the prevailing rate of pay for men was £14 below the national average, while the women workers' pay was £6 below; (iii) that cheaper sources of labour were sought from white female workers and Asians from both the Indian sub-continent and from East Africa; and (iv) how the union collaborated in this  international  scheme  of  things,  acting  as  the  'lieutenants'  of  capital, more concerned with people  'learning  how  things  are  done  in  a  civilised society' than mobilising sections of the class for political change.

Of fundamental importance in this strike was the move away from the trade  union  directives  which  was  a  source  of  political  strength.  In  effect, this  meant  control  of  the  action  of  the  rank  and  file.  Thus  the  'grievance meetings' of the entire strike force became the organisational focus.

Significantly, the power of the women came not only from their being half of the strike force, but from their position as mothers and housewives in the community. Not only did they see capital giving them a low wage, they  saw  it  snatched  back  by  inflation.  In  the  past,  Asian  women  fully supported the industrial demands of their menfolk. Given low wages, they had no choice. The alternative was scabbing. This strike was unique in that the women had the collective power to make their demand for equal pay a priority. They were the latest section of the working class to fall into factory production. As younger and more recent recruits to factory employment in Britain,  their  acute  awareness  of  the  problems  made  them  less  willing  to take the horrors. Their militancy on the picket lines, their forcefulness at the grievance  meetings  and  their  determination  to  fight  till  the  end  were  all proof of this. Later, the Asian workforce would be tried and tested again, in the epic struggle at Grunwick.

## The epic Grunwick strike

If  black  migrant  workers  had  been  exploited  in  small  firms  and  factories because trades unions were either weak or simply not allowed to exist, then the Grunwick strike proved most revealing. It became an historic dispute. Indeed, it was a record-breaking strike; the most militant in British history, undertaken by a white-collar union, resulting in some 550 arrests, hitherto more  than  any  dispute  since  the  General  Strike  of  1926.  Incredibly,  this strike forced the government to set up a Court of Inquiry and made post-war

history  by  bringing  together  500  MPs  in  the  House  of  Commons  on  a Friday afternoon. 42 Further, this dispute not only attracted national, but also international  interest  and  support.  Why? Apart  from  the  anti-union  stand taken  by  Managing  Director,  George  Ward  of  the  Grunwick  Processing Laboratories  Ltd,  a  number  of  related  questions  were  raised,  as  'high politics' became increasingly involved.

The firm, founded by A. Grundy, George Ward and John Hickey, which first began processing (developing and printing) black and white films for photographers in 1965, prospered and grew as more expensive colour film was being used. By 1972, new premises was required off Cobbold Road, Willesden, and in 1973, Grunwick merged with Cooper Pearson, located in Chapter  Road,  Willesden.  Further  progress,  particularly  in  the  mail-order side of the enterprise, resulted in the need for more space to accommodate the rapid expansion. Thus, in 1974 it rented the thirteenth floor of Station House in Wembley, where a computer was installed.

Predictably,  hot  summers  meant  a  rapid  increase  in  photographs  and more  orders  for  Grunwick.  The  increased  workload  in  the  summer  was partly dealt with by employing students. There was nothing unusual about this,  since  Grunwick  had  consistently  done  so  and  found  it  a  workable system.

In  1976,  the  modernised  premises  at  Chapter  Road  accommodated  a busy mail-order department. By  August 1976, the vast majority of Grunwick's staff of 480 were at the Cobbold Road and Chapter Road sites. In fact, about 100  of the 160-170  workers  were  in  the  mail-order department. 43 This department was  not only of vital importance to Grunwick, but also of central concern to the strike and strikers.

By August  1976,  nearly  all  the  workers  engaged  in  mail-order  were migrants  from  East  Africa  who  spoke  predominantly  Gujarati.  A  large number of women formed this group, some wearing saris (their traditional dress); others wore European clothes. Traditionally, and in the popular mind of  the  British  people,  among  others,  these  women  were  passive,  always obedient and subservient to their husbands. There were a number of East African students. In fact, from a total workforce of 429 in August 1976, 140 were  students,  some  of  whom  worked  in  the  mail-order  department. Together, this migrant workforce laboured to procure the increasing profits of the firm. To profit, however, is to exploit. To what degree this is done is

largely dependent on the level of contentment among  the workers. Grunwick  was  no  different  from  other  sweatshops.  In  spite  of  Managing Director  Ward's  complacency,  the  workers'  grievances  were  more  deepseated than he cared to admit.

Among many workers, therefore, it was not surprising when a 19-yearold  worker  (not  a  student)  Devshi  Bhudia,  unhappy  with  pay  conditions, decided to take action on Friday 20 August 1976. That morning, as he put it, he  argued  with  the  mail  order  department  manager,  Malcolm Alden,  who tried to get him to supervise the students in his work area. A 'good worker', Bhudia would only undertake this responsibility, if given more money. The strict  disciplinarian,  Alden,  ordered  Bhudia  to  get  on  with  his  work  and promised a rise later.

That  same  day,  Bhudia  was  given  13  crates  of  new  work,  a  'difficult target'. 44 Given their earlier confrontation, and the task before him, Bhudia expected the worst from the tough 'sacking manager'  Alden. Past discontentment  and  the  'bullying  tactics'  of  management  had  prepared Bhudia  to  expect  the  sack.  Indeed  he  was  ready  to  leave  that  day  as  an individual expression of protest. He was not alone in feeling this way.

If some were aware but cowed by gratefulness to have a job (especially at a time of high unemployment), others were more sensitive and outspoken about  the  grievances.  One  of  the  grievances  was  Alden's  'aggressive manner'  by  pressurising  slower  workers  with  dismissals  and  threats  of dismissals. Some evidence of this was reflected in the high labour turnover in the  mail  order  department  which,  in  1976  (albeit  a  time  of  high unemployment) was about 'one hundred per cent as an annual rate'. 45

In time, fear of dismissal became a fundamental grievance at Grunwick. Another grievance more deeply felt was the nature of compulsory overtime. Although  Ward  argued  that  this was  written into their contracts of employment,  the  theory  bore  no  resemblance  to  working  practice  which entailed  long  hours  imposed  at  short  notice,  thus  disrupting  the  workers' private  lives.  One  woman  who  had  worked  65  hours  per  week  in  the summer,  in  evidence  to  the  Scarman  Inquiry,  said  she  had  accepted 'compulsory overtime', but not 'till 10 o'clock at night'.

Alden,  an  excellent  enforcer  of  compulsory  overtime  at  short  notice, had become unpopular among workers in his department. Bhudia, for one, was  particularly  concerned  about  this  grievance.  Other  irritants  to  the

workers  were  close  surveillance  through  glass-fronted  offices  and  the suffocating heat. Taken together, these grievances led to a certain amount of unity  of  thought  and  action.  Devshi  Bhudia  and  three  of  his  workmates were not thinking of trade unions when they decided that Friday afternoon to work slowly in anticipation of dismissal. They anticipated that if one of them was given the sack, the other three would walk out in protest. Surely this reasoning was a reflection of the frustration and despair of four young workers  who  were  acutely  aware  of  having  no  machinery  through  which they  could  channel  their  grievances.  Since  they  could  not  change  things through the process of negotiations within Grunwick, they were prepared to vote  with  their  feet! As  it  was,  the  13  crates,  still  unsorted,  led  to  a  row between Bhudia and Alden, following which Bhudia was sacked. His three work-mates  told  Alden  the  dismissal  was  'unfair',  before  resigning  in protest.

The  four  workmates  stood  outside  the  Chapter  Road  gate  arguing. Whether  or  not  they  discussed  trade  unions  was  by  the  by.  What  was important is that they stayed at the gate, instead of going home. These four young Asians standing at the Chapter Road gate was the beginning of a long and  bruising  presence  on  a  picket  line  that  would  have  far-reaching consequences  for  British  industrial  relations.  Thus,  the  historic  Grunwick Strike had begun.

While the four men stood outside, Jayaben Desai, a middle-aged Indian woman, four feet ten inches tall and slightly built, was packing up work to go  home.  Unlike  most  of  the  Grunwick  employees,  she  was  born  in  the Gujarat. Although physically small, passive obedience was not her pattern of  behaviour.  While  at  school  during  the  time  of  Indian  independence, though young, she was already independent-minded in her views. She was aware of the imprisonment of Gandhi (who was also a Gujarati) and Nehru, by the British in India, and had listened to Gandhi's lectures on philosophy which were broadcast on Indian radio, after he was assassinated in 1948. This  was  all  a  long  time  ago,  but  it  was  not  lost  on  her.  Her  Gandhian background would serve her well during the desperate weeks of struggle in the summer weather which came and went, and in the cold and wet streets that  led  to  and  from  Grunwick.  This  frail  figure  came  to  symbolise  the determination of the strikers to win. How did she come to Britain?

Jayaben married Suryakant Desai, a Gujarati from Tanzania. She lived for  many years in Tanzania where her husband managed a tyre company.

Earlier, to maintain British supremacy in Africa, thousands of Gujaratis and other East Indians were imported to build railways. Although many of the original workers returned to India, after the railways were built those who stayed constituted the artisans, craftsmen and shopkeepers, the middle-class of  East  Africa,  acting  as  a  buffer  between  the  Whites  (landowners  and administrators) and the unskilled black African masses. Needless to say, this remained a source of discontentment among Africans. The British Imperial strategy of divide and rule helped matters little. Nevertheless, when Kenya, Uganda  and  Tanzania  gained  independence  early  in  the  1960s,  the  East African Asians hoped to be assimilated. But the closed Gujarati community, which had supported the white rulers so well in the past opted to keep their British  passports.  Thus,  in  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s,  East  African Asians were forced to leave.

Many  of  the  thousands  who  arrived  in  Britain  settled  in  the  London borough  of  Brent  and  elsewhere  in  Britain.  Moreover,  they  have  had  to accept  a  'lower  standard  of  living'.  Unlike  the  earlier  waves  of  migrants, the East African Asians were forced to settle in Britain. Their dilemma was that  they  were  caught  between  the  humiliation  of  expulsion  (particularly during President  Amin's regime) and the Conservative government's Immigration  Act  of  1971  and  the  provocative  race-speeches  of  Enoch Powell. Animosity greeted them in Britain as the neo-fascist National Front stirred  race-hatred.  The  Ugandan Asians  came  in  for  a  particularly  chilly British reception.

The East African Asians then were also unlike other black migrants in that  of  all  the  migrant  groups  in  Britain,  although  they  possessed  better educational qualification, they received the lowest average earnings. 46 The cumulative effect of these circumstances led to great disillusionment. As it was,  this  middle-class  group  were  forced  to  do  largely  semi-skilled  and unskilled work. Taken together, the effect of all these factors was accentuated by the powerful impact of work-a-day slights to their dignity and self-respect at Grunwick, among other workplaces in Britain.

In dealing with racists, Mrs Desai was understanding, even forgiving to those  who  had  'no  knowledge  of  history'.  When  she  and  her  husband arrived  in  Britain  in  1969,  they  had  to  start  a  new  life.  He  worked  for Desoutter  Engineering  in  Wembley  as  an  unskilled  labourer,  while  she laboured on a sewing machine in Harlesden. Given her husband's improved earnings,  she  was  able  to  attend  to  the  affairs  of  the  home  and  their  two

children. This period, as a full-time housewife, was, however, short-lived. The need for money forced her to seek part-time employment at Grunwick, working during the evenings between 5 and 10 pm. Rising unemployment nationally  led  to  her  accepting  full-time  employment  at  the  company  in September 1974.

Almost two years later (during which time she tolerated many indignities), as she was about to leave her workplace, a supervisor barked at her,  'Who  told  you  to  pack  up?'  This  hostile  approach  reactivated  strong feelings  against  management's  imposition  of  compulsory  overtime  which the  abrupt  question  inevitably  implied. Although  she  had  not  objected  to compulsory overtime as part of her contract, the short notice given and the 'atmosphere of fear' concerning overtime had become too much. Following the question, new work was given to her which meant working until after 7pm. She had not worked past this hour before at Chapter Road and was angry now that management was ordering her to do so. Fear of management in the mail order department seemed all-pervasive. The spectre of dismissal was the particular fear in Mrs Desai's mind. Indeed, this proved decisive. Confronted by Alden alone (and anticipating the sack) she said to him (as she explained to the Court of Inquiry): 'If you are prepared to listen to me I am prepared to listen to you as well, but if you shout like that to me I am not talking to you.' Alden's words, 'I warn you', alarmed her into making the  pre-emptive  statement,  'Anybody,  anytime,  we  expect  our  sack  … Look, I do not want to work for you. I do not want your warning … Please give me my cards straight away.'

Before  leaving,  she  told  the  workers  in  Gujarati  that  hers  was  a voluntary decision. 'My friends', she said, 'listen to this. What is happening to  me  today  will  happen  to  you  tomorrow.  This  man  wouldn't  speak  to white workers like he speaks to us. He says he is giving me the sack but I am  leaving  myself.  I  do  not  want  to  be  given  his  sack.'  Realising  her position  was  now  beyond  recall,  for  good  measure,  she  addressed  the workers  nearest  to  her:  'I  am  asking  this  in  front  of  Mr Alden  and  I  am asking him why he is not employing any white girls in this department.' 47 This  privately  well-understood  discrepancy  was  now  given  a  bold,  public airing. As hard-working people with 'small money' she felt Grunwick was 'taking hard work from us'. Once and for all, she wanted it to be understood that,  'I  am  leaving  myself  and  you  have  to  understand  that  I  am  here  to clear it that I am leaving myself. Do not understand he sacked me. That is

why I am asking him in front of you: 'Please give me my cards''. With her son Sunil, at her side, they both 'harangued' the workforce. According to the Morning Star , her final words to the 'sacking manager' Malcolm Alden were: 'What you are running here is not a factory, it is a zoo. But in a zoo there  are  many  types  of  animals.  Some  are  monkeys  who  dance  on  your finger tips, others are lions who can bite your head off. We are those lions, Mr Manager.'

At the gates, Jayaben Desai and her son Sunil found a 'picket line' of the  four  men  who,  earlier  that  day,  had  started  the  Grunwick  Strike. Together, their discussions triggered-off forms of protest, one of which was trade unionism. This Mrs Desai pondered and discussed with her husband. 48 At that stage, it seemed, trade unionism was a means of protest against their grievances and not designed to win recognition (of the union to be formed) and  reinstatement.  Nevertheless,  Mrs  Desai  grasped  the  trade  union  idea fervently, a commitment she was ready to take to its bitter end.

That weekend, the search for a trade union was initiated by Sunil Desai who  prepared  a  petition  for  Grunwick  management  and  placards  'for  a strike that did not exist'. Thus prepared, that Monday morning Grunwick's directors found  pickets  at  their gate  on  Chapter  Road.  The  strikers' campaign for support for trade unionism by signing a petition resulted in the support of 'nearly every' member of the mail order department. 49

After  advice  from  the  Citizens  Advice  Bureau,  contact  with  Jack Dromey, Secretary of the Brent Trades Council, and advice from the TUC., APEX was approached as the 'appropriate' union for the strikers. Given that it  was  almost  impossible  to  organise  anything  inside  the  factory  without management's  interference,  the  strikers  decided  to  call  for  an  immediate walkout that Monday afternoon of those in favour of joining a union. To the surprise of Alden and his line-manager Duffy, over 50 workers walked out at  3  pm  from  the  Chapter  Road  site  and  assembled  at  the  gate  with  the original 'pickets'.

As Dromey rightly stated, 'even now the Grunwick Strike was still not really off the ground. It was still only a walkout from Chapter Road.' The walkout had its own dynamic: a 'liberating effect' on the workers as all the past grievances were voiced and publicly endorsed by their assembly and placards, a show of solidarity.

The  strikers  who  had  remained  more  or  less  at  Chapter  Road  were joined  by  'seven  or  eight'  from  Cobbold  Road.  Thus  strengthened,  the revolt  gathered  momentum.  The  seed  of  trade  unionism  had  been  truly planted. That day Alden was told his offer of reinstatement would only be accepted if they could have a trade union. Alden was firm: he would only have them back as 'individuals' (the great cornerstone of the firm), not as a union. The idea of a combination of individuals - a union - was anathema, even at that embryonic stage.

The next day, the strikers leafleted the Chapter Road and Cobbold Road buildings calling for a mass meeting of the Grunwick workforce to be held that lunchtime in the car park of the White Hart pub. By now, professional help was to hand in the form of Jack Dromey and local APEX members. Increasingly, Dromey became involved. These developments aroused deep concern  among  the  directors  of  Grunwick.  Indeed,  that  Tuesday,  John Hickey,  a  38-year-old  founder-director  (in  the  absence  of  George  Ward, Managing Director of Grunwick) used fear again to prevent an exodus of his labour force to join the strikers on the picket line. He warned that any walkout by those then employed was futile, since a trade union would never be accepted by Grunwick. The message, reflecting Grunwick's philosophy, was clear.

The company was so anti-union that it emphasised it would rather close down than recognise a trade union. So dismissive of trade unionism (and indeed  of  industrial  relations)  was  Grunwick's  management  that  when cross-examined at the Court of Inquiry, Hickey could not define 'collective bargaining'.  The  fact  that  they  did  not  care  for  industrial  relations  might have been forgivable, but this was a British firm, operating at a sophisticated level in the twentieth century. But this, as the Judges argued, was no grounds to victimise the freedom of a small, committed anti-union employer  who  instilled  fear  among  his  workforce. At  least  he  should  be allowed the freedom to exploit that!

That Tuesday, whatever chances there might have been of a compromise between  the  company  and  the  strikers  vanished.  After  it  was  formally decided to join a union through Dromey and an APEX representative on the Brent Trades Council, 60 strikers who met at the Brent Trades Hall, joined the union and elected a delegation to meet Len Gristey, an APEX official. The  formation  of  a  union  was  welcomed  by  many  members  of  the workforce at Cobbold Road who began walking out at about 11 o'clock on

Wednesday  morning.  Noorali  Valliani  (a  Pakistani  technician  with  some trade  union  experience)  and  Vipin  Magdani  (who  had  none)  led  the walkout.

At  this  stage,  management  was  still  interested  in  getting  the  strikers back to work. George Ward, still holidaying in Ireland, reiterated that on no account would he allow a trade union in his company. What was he afraid of?  Many  workers  began  to  question  their  position vis-à-vis a  union. Increasingly, workers drifted out of the factory to join the strike. By Friday the number of strikers was 137 out of a total workforce of 480, and a total weekly paid workforce of 430 (176 male, 254 female). Of the 137 on strike, 46 were students. Clearly, this was not a student-led revolt.

Representing this solid, militant backing, the first letter from APEX was sent  to  the  Grunwick  management  on  Friday  27  August.  The  company directors acted promptly by seeking legal advice. Although these directors (largely ignorant of industrial relations procedures) did not know it at the time, it was to be their saving grace.

On the same day that the Grunwick board of directors met, APEX made the  strike  official  by  announcing  that  strike  pay  would  be  given  to  the strikers. The emphasis of this decision was, however, lessened as Grunwick hit  back  hard.  The  company  despatched  dismissal  notices  to  the  strikers. Not  only  were  the  137  workers  who  walked  out  sacked  (for  breach  of contract)  Hickey  also  rejected  APEX's  claim  for  recognition.  In  fact, dismissal had become inevitable once the workers had joined the union. 50 From this point onwards, it was argued that the labour movement rallied to the cause of the strikers as a 'recognition issue', bearing in mind that the strike  was  not  started  by  trade  unionists.  Frustration,  built  up  over  a  long period, because they could not give vent to their grievances for 'fear', found full and liberating expression in the spontaneous demand for a trade union. As  immigrant  workers,  they  were  at  a  particularly  severe  disadvantage. Indeed, the PEP report found East African Asians to be greatly disadvantaged  in  terms  of  employment.  Having  come  from  middle-class backgrounds and having been occupationally downgraded, their self-respect was at stake in view of Grunwick's disregard for the human sensibilities of their workers. In fact, the company regarded its workforce simply as cost in a balance sheet that must show a profit. This was, indeed, the raison d'être of the company. There was no need for human values. Len Murray, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, caught the stikers' mood

accurately when he told them that trade unionism meant self-respect, 'the right to answer the gaffer back'. Clearly such self-respect had no place in George Ward's 'Fort Grunwick'. And, as he was to prove, the Judges' law was on his side.

Grunwick  had  grown  and  expanded  continuously. Its mail order business had prospered so much that, although strike-bound, it was still the 'most efficient' and 'least expensive' of all film-processing companies. Just before the walkout in August 1976, the prospects looked distinctly good for Grunwick;  its  pre-tax  profits  rose  from  £13,500  in  1969  to  £126,719  in 1973-74 and then to £210,687 in 1975-76. Ward was cock-a-hoop that his 'sweatshop' was  one  'happy  family'. In fact, with his relatives, he controlled  51  per  cent  of  'GP  Combined'. 51 Moreover,  the  firm  was fortunate  in  not  having  experienced  labour  unrest  since  1973.  His  profits rose rapidly because, to a large extent, his company was strike-free. He was able to maintain  this strike-free position by  instilling fear among  a vulnerable  immigrant  workforce,  who  knew  little  or  nothing  about  trade unionism. The question remained: what were the causes of the walkout and strike in August 1976?

While low pay, racism and the oppression of women were contributory factors, the main cause of the Grunwick strike was the 'conditions of work'. Of  these  conditions,  compulsory  overtime  was  of  primary  concern.  Even the  concession  of  leaving  work  (during  the  slack  period  in  winter)  a  half hour  or  an  hour  earlier  was  not  enough  to  compensate  for  the  long  extra hours worked during the summer.

Holiday entitlement was another source of discontentment. After 1974, as  Grunwick increased its immigrant labour force it decreased its holiday entitlement. Though honourable by Ward's standards, the intention here was clear,  particularly  since  the  two-week  holiday  entitlement,  if  requested  in the  summer,  could  only  be  granted  at  management's  discretion. This  was insufferable for people from the tropics to take their holiday (except in few cases)  annually  during  the  winter.  Given  low  pay,  saving  for  a  holiday abroad during the winter months was unrealistic. And furthermore, for those who had managed to save enough to visit relatives or friends abroad, two weeks  was  much  too  short  a  time  to  make  such  a  journey  (holiday) worthwhile.  Naturally  then,  these  'sweatshop'  conditions  either  had  to change or lead to inevitable rebellion.

Underpinning  these conditions were  the insistent dictates of bad management. Although management varied from department to department, in the mail order department, management was somehow able to create an atmosphere  of  real  fear  among  those  who  were  'expecting  our  sack'. Management's failure was reflected in the fact that labour turnover was 100 per cent; bonuses and rises were given at the discretion of the manager; and most significantly Grunwick's directors like Hickey and Alden (self-made men) had read little and understood little about the art of management and, in particular, industrial relations.

Although there was a works committee, there was a distinct lack of any mechanism for dealing with workers' grievances which were significantly numerous and specific to immigrant workers. As for the works committee, many workers such as Devshi Bhudia and his friends were not aware of it. George  Ward,  however,  argued  that  there  had  been  an  elected  works committee  at  Grunwick  since  1973,  which  was  'not  designed  as  an alternative  to  direct  contact  between  workers  and  management,  but  as  a supplement to it'. 52 The only direct contact between workers and management it seemed was when managers such as Alden, with an arrogant and severe tone, barked orders of work.

It seems that the manager of the mail order department, Malcolm Alden, was  particularly  hard  on  his  workers.  Whatever  personality  traits  he  had brought to bear (such as his bullying tactics) in getting the work done, they were  never  publicly  disowned  by  Ward.  Efficiency  in  both  Alden  and Ward's mind meant getting the job done. Those who back-pedalled under the pressure would be sacked. In the East African Asians, Ward picked on the  wrong  group  of  migrants.  Unlike  earlier  black  migrants  they  did  not come to Britain for 'economic' reasons. Therefore, their treatment by their employer was high on their list of priorities for a good management.

Grunwick's  problems  were  a  reflection  of  similar  problems  of  small firms elsewhere  in Britain. Though  they  were  small,  their workers' problems  were  no  less  real  or  significant.  In  fact,  at  the  time  of  the Grunwick strike there was an estimated 800,000 small and medium firms in Britain, employing 3.2 million workers. 53 Indeed, the publicity received by Grunwick  workers  led  to  a  growing  demand  for  information  about  trade unions from the Brent Trades Hall.

An important  aspect  which  went  into  the  taking  of  this  initial  step  to walk out and join a union was the sense of community of those who went on  strike.  Increasingly,  some  myths  were  shattered  in  that  the  'passive' Asian  women at  Grunwick  proved  to  be  as  militant,  if  not  more  militant than the men. They came out to challenge their oppressive employer, at a time when the trade union movement was in retreat.

Support for the strike from sections of the British labour movement was quick and widespread. As it happened, about two weeks after the walkout on Monday 6 September 1976, the Trades Union Congress met. Encouraged by the strong commitment of the strikers for trade union recognition, both APEX and the local Brent Trades Council became involved.

APEX, a 'right-wing', white-collar union, was founded in 1890, and by 1976 had a membership of 142,000 half of whom were women. The union's positive response to the Grunwick strikers' call for help was exemplary in that within three days it accepted the strikers as members of the union and within only eight days on 17 September, they began to receive strike pay of £8  per  week  backdated  to  31  August.  Moreover,  this  strike  pay  was increased to £12 per week supplemented by payments of between £2.50 and £6 to individual strikers. This benefit had the effect of welding the strikers firmly together as winter approached.

The  General  Secretary  of  APEX,  Roy  Grantham,  was  a  shrewd  and extremely capable trade unionist. Whatever else Ward might have thought of him for coming to the strikers' aid so quickly and positively, Grantham was  no  radical.  Indeed,  he  was  a  moderate  trade  unionist  whose  union supported  entry  into  the  European  Common  Market,  the  government's Social Contract and insisted that candidates for office should declare their political affiliations. 54

The  need  of  the  strikers  and  the  attitude  of  Grunwick's  management towards  trade  unions  had  touched-off  his  own  deep  commitment  to  trade unionism. In this spirit, he mounted the rostrum of the TUC on 7 September to deliver a powerful speech on behalf of his new Grunwick members. He maintained  that  the  Grunwick  management  had  gone  over  the  top  in exploiting black immigrant workers. His impassioned plea met the approval of  Tom  Jackson,  General  Secretary  of  the  Union  of  Post  Office  Workers, which promised help. In the meantime, the company was silent. Anticipating  resistance  from  the  Grunwick  management,  after  writing  to

Jackson for the official support of the post office workers, Grantham also wrote to Len Murray calling for the support of the TUC.

Grantham's  strategy  was  first  to  seek  the  reinstatement  of  the  137 sacked members. As Dromey put it, Grantham's argument was based upon custom: 'It was not without precedent in Britain for strike action to precede union membership but it was unusual for workers on strike to be sacked and stay sacked. Most peace settlements where strikers had been sacked started with the reinstatement of those dismissed. Recognition and the tackling of the grievances of the strikers came second in the list of objectives.' 55

In effect, the Grunwick members became part of the Hythe Road branch of  APEX  in  Brent  of  which  Gristey  was  in  charge.  Gristey,  'a  hearty individual', was faced with the task of organising the Grunwick members who were 'as green as cooking apples'. After an earlier attempt in August, he  tried  again  to  open  negotiations  with  Grunwick  management  on  8 September. He was rejected. Grunwick remained ominously silent. Gristey and Grantham, having drawn a blank thus far (unusual for them), had begun to  consider  the  prospect  of  a  hard  battle  for  which,  at  that  stage,  they seemed to be prepared. In spite of his charms, as the front-man during the dispute,  at  the  beginning  he  found  it  difficult  to  communicate  with  the workers.  However,  unlike  so  many  trade  union  officials,  he  tried  smiling through. But smiles from a trade union official representing black workers in  Britain  was  clearly  not  enough.  By  November  1976,  when  asked  by  a striker  at  a  mass  meeting  if  there  was  really  any  hope  of  victory,  Gristey assured  the  strikers,  'I  promise  you  that  no  power  in  Christendom  will defeat you.' 56

Apart from APEX union officials, the strikers were in close contact with Dromey  and  the  local  Trades  Council.  His  role  in  the  dispute  cannot  be denied. As  the  local  representative  of  the  TUC  in  Brent,  he  was  in  close liaison with the strikers. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Council generously made available its Labour Hall which was used as the strikers 'headquarters'.

Gristey  and  the  Council  advised  the  strikers  who  elected  a  Strike Committee which started issuing strike bulletins. The first Secretary of the Committee was Sunil Desai and the Treasurer was his mother, Mrs Desai. Noorali Valliani was elected Chairman (later replaced by Kamlesh Gandhi) and Mahmood Ahmed succeeded Sunil who had to continue his studies. The

Strike Committee of 15 members, with Gristey and Dromey as non-voting members, was the cultural focus of the strikers, and their bulletins reflected the  progression  of  their  feelings,  hopes  and  fears  as  the  strike  developed into  national  (and  international)  proportions.  During  the  first  months,  the Strike Committee  was  highly  effective holding committee  and  mass meetings in the Trades Hall daily for the first six weeks.

George  Ward  was  no  friend of the Trades Council. Predictably, therefore, as the Council actively supported the strikers, Ward singled out Dromey (Secretary of the Council) as 'the key adviser' 57 to the strikers, one of the prime 'stirrers' in the Brent area, the 'moving spirit' behind the Strike Committee as fabricating the strike. While the 'virgin' strikers knew little about trade unions, like 'chickens out of a coop', 58 Ward denied the strikers their  individuality  and  the  ability  to  determine  what  they  wanted.  Their walkout was not proof enough. Rather he saw the strikers (a reflection of his  attitude  towards  them  as  an  employer)  as  putty  in  the  hands  of  Jack Dromey. It was clear he personally disliked Dromey, who was trying to use his position to get a 'political platform'. Indeed, he was reported as saying, 'I'll  make  him  a  political  eunuch  before  I'm  finished',  and  wrote  that Dromey said to him during picketing, 'We're going to close you, Ward.' 'I am  not  an  aggressive  man',  said  Ward,  'but  I  could  not  refrain  from replying, 'I think you're going to be a failed revolutionary - we're going to trim your beard.' ' 59 Further, in his personal battle with Dromey, he stated that  Dromey's  'propaganda  served  to  stiffen  our  resolve', 60 and  later boasted  that  Dromey  'continually  underestimated  our  determination  to resist and our resourcefulness. We were able to outmanoeuvre him at every turn.' 61

From  these  statements,  it  seemed  that  the  focus  of  the  dispute  had shifted to Dromey  and  his  left-wing  politics,  relegating  the  strikers' demands  (for  the  time  being  at  least)  as  being  of  secondary  importance. This personal conflict would lead Ward, the supreme egoist, to go to any lengths to reinforce his commitment against trade unionism at Grunwick.

Another  leading  figure,  Tom  Durkin,  Chairman  of  the  Brent  Trades Council, a staunch supporter of trade union rights (who was involved in an earlier  dispute  with  Grunwick  in  1973),  only  confirmed Ward's  do  or  die approach. It had become clear by the autumn of 1976 that polar opposites faced each other in a war of attrition. Necessarily, therefore, both sides had

to prepare for the struggle. Thus, the 'virgin' migrant strikers were thrown into  the  maelstrom  of  trade  unionism,  industrial  relations  and  into  the essential nature of British politics of the hard Left and the hard Right. In the middle,  there  were  the  Liberals  and  moderate  Labour  leaders  with  high ideals  and  the  rhetoric  of  the  'brotherhood  of  man'.  Increasingly  strong words and positive action in support of the strikers gave no indication as to the outcome when faced with the acid test: a full-scale confrontation.

Already  by  the  autumn.  Dromey  was  complaining  that  the  Grunwick Strike,  'increasingly consumed the energies of the Trades Council'. 62 The people  of  Brent,  however,  responded  magnificently  with  donations  from Mulliner  Park  Wards/Rolls  Royce  Works  Committee,  Express  Dairies, Associated  Automation  (GEC),  TGWU,  the  UPW  Cricklewood  Office Branch and a Miners Lodge in South Wales. 63

Through the Trades Council's initiating efforts, the Strike Committee's weekly bulletins were published. This proved to be a vital communication link in arousing widespread support for the strike. They were, with the help of  the  Liaison  Committee  for  the  Defence  of  Trades  Unions,  distributed throughout  the  country.  Paul  Vig  and  Sunil  Desai,  the  first  writers  of  the bulletin, now put forward their case to a wide audience. Regular socials and meetings canvassed further support. Each day, each week, the strikers found new supporters, but they also spent less time with their close knit families. 'Sari Power' and marches meant less time with, and disruptions to family life. Anticipating this the strikers and  the  Trades Council  called an unprecedented  meeting  of  husbands  and  relatives  of  the  Asian  women strikers. This highly imaginative and practical development was absolutely necessary  to  reassure  families  and  thus  sustain  the  effects  of  the  struggle they  were  in.  British  trade  unionism  had  known  little  or  nothing  of  this strategy before. Now it was being proved that, in spite of a different social and cultural pattern, militant migrant workers can be accommodated within the  system  of  industrial  relations  if  some  of  the  trade  unions  employing black  workers  were  not  so  hidebound  by  tradition  and  racism.  In  fact,  if industrial  relations  was  a  changing  system,  then  'Sari  Power'  should  be accepted as part of this framework and indeed of the industrial scene. After a march of 400 people from Grunwick's Cobbold Road to its Chapter Road site on 1 October 1976, it was observed that,

… outside the factory gates of Willesden the High Road suddenly exploded  into  a  blaze  of  colour.  Down  the  road,  banners  flying, swept  hundreds  of  demonstrators,  led  by  Indian  workers.  In  the vanguard,  saris  swirling,  were  the  Indian  women.  Not  submissive housebound  women  but  Grunwick  strikers  -  fists  raised  in  anger. Not  the  inarticulate  immigrant  women  we  are  often  told  about. Hardly.  For  at  every  building  they  passed,  they  shouted  their  one resounding slogan: 'Union! Union! We want union!' 64

The Indian women involved shouted 'Union!' with the full support of their  husbands.  By  early  October  1976,  together  the  Strike  Committee, APEX and  the  Trades  Council  brought  pressure  to  bear  on  Grunwick  to enter  negotiations.  In  addition,  individuals  and  organisations  within  the Indian community and local MPs were asked for support. Ward stated that several people, claiming membership of the Brent Indian Workers' Association,  had  put  pressure  on  the  relatives  of  one  of  his  workers,  and that his small company was subjected to a 'tremendous propaganda barrage, sniped at by MPs and union chiefs who had never set foot inside the firm'. In  spite  of  the  growing  pressure  to  negotiate  and  conclude  a  peaceful settlement, he dug his heels in. Having sunk 'our life savings' and 'many years of our lives' in the company, since Grunwick had always 'led from the front' to secure the jobs of its workers, Ward wrote, 'We were determined to guarantee their livelihoods, whatever the cost.' 65

Whatever the pressure then Ward had shifted the anti-union emphasis to show  his  magnanimity  in  putting  the  interest  of  his  workforce  first. Unfortunately,  the  favourable  image  of  a  caring  and  good  employer  was contradicted  by  a  statement  he  made  at  the  outset  of  his  book  which revealed the real basis of his stand. He wrote that he had grown fairly thickskinned  about  being  tagged  a  'reactionary  employer'  and  an  'inflexible, hardline,  anti-trade  unionist'.  He  then  made  it  abundantly  clear,  'I  don't much care what people think of me; I care what   think of me.' 66  Bearing I this in mind, he explained his position vis-à-vis the trade unions thus:

The pickets have said that they are besieging Grunwick because we will not permit our workers to join a trade union. This is a complete fabrication  …  I  have  never  dismissed  an  employee  for  joining  a union, and there are a number of union members still working in the

company. But this is different from granting an official status to the union  by  'recognition',  giving  it  the  contractual  right  to  negotiate with the company. 67

He feared that in practice this would mean that the union was likely to seek to negotiate not just for its own members but for the whole workforce and eventually try to impose a 'closed shop', excluding from employment all  those  who  refused  to  join.  Moreover,  he  was  not  prepared  to  accept APEX's  other  major  demand,  reinstatement  of  the  strikers  who  were lawfully  dismissed  for  'breach  of  contract  and  industrial  misconduct'. Indeed, given the impasse between the company and APEX, the directors were not prepared 'to let Grunwick move one inch in the direction of the closed shop'. 68 The  gap  between  the  two  sides  was  clear. And  during  the autumn months of 1976 there was no reasonable grounds for compromise. Ward  was  prepared  for  all  or  nothing.  Indeed,  he  was  prepared  to  'close down  the  business'  rather  than  agree  to  conduct  it  on  the  terms  of 'organised bullies'. 69

The strikers, APEX and Brent Trades Council, did not know of these entrenched  views  of  them  held  by  Ward  and  his  associates.  In  fact,  in October 1976 they were optimistic, hoping for a speedy settlement. Early in the month, in view of Ward's intransigence, Grantham led a delegation of strikers to press the Secretary of State for Employment, Albert Booth, for a Court  of  Inquiry  into  the  dispute.  This  was  not  granted.  Instead  Booth referred to the Employment Protection Act (1975) which provided machinery for  the  resolution  of  the  dispute.  Under  section  11  of  the Act, ACAS was allowed to investigate the union's claim for recognition.

ACAS  was  the  outcome  of  the  Report  of  the  Royal  Commission  on Trade Unions, known  as the Donovan  Commission  Report.  ACAS, constituted  by  the  Conservative  government  of  1970-74,  had  its  terms  of reference enlarged by the Labour government of 1974. With the dismantling of  the  National  Industrial  Relations  Court,  a  'consensus  approach'  to  the resolution  of  problems  was  embodied  in ACAS. The  Service's  governing Council  comprised  three  TUC  representatives,  three  Confederation  of British  Industries  representatives  and  three  academics.  Charged  with  the duty  'of  encouraging  the  extension  of  collective  bargaining',  ACAS  is 'independent'  of  the  government.  However,  ACAS  had  no  powers  to

enforce  its  decisions.  The  whole  object  of  this  tripartite  exercise  was  to persuade the parties involved, not to compel them.

Given these limited powers and Ward's continuing refusal to negotiate, according to Dromey, Grantham reluctantly referred the deadlock to ACAS. On  1 November  when  the Union of Post Office Workers blacked Grunwick's  mail,  the  police  arrested  nine  pickets.  The  blacking  action cheered  the  strikers,  their  families  and  their  supporters.  Indeed,  they  felt victory would be theirs. On the other hand, Ward, alarmed by the blacking, 'a  threat  to  our  jugular', 70 turned  to  John  Gorst,  the  Conservative MP for Barnet and Hendon North, for advice. This led to Ward's agreement to meet ACAS. He was not impressed. 'It seemed to me', he said, 'that the rules [of ACAS]  were  made  up  as  you  went  along.'  He  insisted  that  the  proper subject for any ACAS inquiry was 'the opinion of our workers'. ACAS, on the  other  hand,  insisted  that  views  of  the  sacked  workers  had  to  be  taken into account. Resisting outside interferences in 'his business', Ward made perhaps  the  most  important  move  that  had  far-reaching  consequences, beyond a local dispute, and ultimately affecting the outcome of the dispute: he  turned  to  the  lawyers.  From  here  on  Ward's  reluctance  to  negotiate, incited  intense  and  widespread  feelings  among  trade  unionists,  left-wing groups, labour leaders and politicians. The strike at Grunwick was national news daily as the strikers' action received unprecedented publicity. Given the proportions  which  the  dispute  assumed,  the  political  implications necessarily came into focus.

On  4  November  1976,  Grunwick  was  debated  in  Parliament.  Earlier, Ward had enlisted the support of John Gouriet and the right-wing National Association  for  Freedom  (NAFF)  which  brought  pressure  to  bear  on  the blacking of Grunwick. During the debate, Albert Booth announced that the UPW  had  agreed  to  suspend  its  blacking  of  Grunwick  on  receiving  an assurance that the company would co-operate with ACAS. On the face of it, it seemed  only  a  matter  of  time  before  the  dispute  was  settled.  But encouraged by the lifting of the blacking, Ward was boastful. He felt that the  UPW  blacking  was  called  off  because  of  the  combined  effect  of  the threat  of  legal  action  and  Parliamentary  pressure. 71 Increasingly,  law  and order  and  politics  would  enter  the  debate  on  the  central  issues  of  union recognition and reinstatement of the strikers.

Given  the  possibility  of  a  ballot  of  his  existing  workforce,  Ward  and company increased the wages of their workforce by 15 per cent towards the end  of  November.  This  incentive  had  the  desired  effect  of  getting  the workforce to back the company in the event of a ballot. The strikers, faced with wintry weather, had the support of Len Murray who spoke to them and their supporters at Brent Trades Hall. Towards the end of December, ACAS had  become  wary  of  its  attempts  to  win  Grunwick's  co-operation  for  a ballot of its workers. Delaying tactics was Grunwick's strategy. Efforts to get Grunwick to another meeting with ACAS had failed by Christmas. At this  point,  ACAS  felt  justified  in  sending  out  110  questionnaires  on  29 December to a list of Grunwick's employees (supplied in the absence of the company's  co-operation)  by  APEX.  Of  these  questionnaires,  the  93  that were returned all voted 'yes' to trade union recognition at Grunwick.

By the turn  of  the  year  (in  fact,  several  weeks  into  the  New Year)  in February 1977, Grunwick, with enough time to respond to the outcome of the  ballot,  countered  with  its  own  ballot.  The  company  employed  the Market  Opinion  Research  Insitute  (MORI)  which  found  that  the  weeklypaid staff of 153 workers voted against having a trade union and 21 voted for.  APEX  felt  that  the  137  workers  who  walked  out  should  have  been included in this  poll.  Moreover,  the  vote  was  undertaken  in  conditions  of duress  -  both  the  recent  pay  rise  and  the  'fear'  of  losing  their  jobs  were coercive elements in the 'yes' vote. Indeed, the truth in this statement was reflected in the fact that a few months later in June and July, more workers joined the strike. 72

While Ward was jubilant following the MORI result of his workforce, ACAS  was  not  impressed  by  his  image  of  being  a  good  employer  and decided to produce a preliminary report which would be sent to APEX and Grunwick for comment. Later, a full report would be made. Needless to say, if  Ward  did  not  look  forward  to  the  report,  the  battle-weary  strikers  were eagerly hoping for a favourable one, particularly since February and March brought  no  victory,  only  'setbacks  and  defeats'  which  had  begun  to  take their toll.

NAFF's continuing anti-union strategy in getting an injunction preventing the blacking of Grunwick mail, which was contained in the High Court and upheld on appeal, momentarily dealt a real blow to the strikers' morale. The victory they had expected to come quickly was still elusive. On 10 March 1977, however, the final ACAS report was published. NAFF and

Grunwick  fared  badly. ACAS's  recommendation  of  recognition  of APEX also received the support of James  Prior, the Shadow  Minister  for Employment  in  the  Conservative  Party.  As  far as the strikers were concerned, this was a victory. But how real was it in terms of meeting their demands? NAFF's 'legal' strategy, having caused havoc in the past, was to do  so  again:  Grunwick's  threat  to  take ACAS  to  court  to  have  its  report declared invalid became a fact when on 19 April Grunwick served a High Court writ on ACAS which asked that the report be invalidated because it was  limited  to  Grunwick's  'former  employees'  -  the  strikers.  In  effect, Ward  had  taken  NAFF's  advice  and  acted.  This  'insolence'  angered  the trade union movement. Dromey commented, 'Grunwick was taking ACAS to court for not carrying out a survey which Grunwick itself had refused to allow.' 73

In doing so, Ward felt confident that he had secured the support of his existing workforce which was awarded another pay increase of 10 per cent on 1 April. 74 A week before this, on 23 March, the General Council of the TUC  had  turned  down  APEX's  request  for  the  blacking  of  essential services.  And  on  the  same  day,  an  Industrial  Tribunal  ruled  it  had  'no jurisdiction' to say whether the strikers were sacked fairly or unfairly.

If  the  spring  had  brought  setbacks,  defeats  and  despair  to  the  strikers, the summer of 1977 called forth a dramatic increase in support from trade unionists  and  sympathisers  on  the  one  hand,  and  a  quick  response  of  a massive  police  presence  on  the  other.  On  27  April,  over  1400  people marched through Willesden in support of the strike. Police harassment of the Grunwick pickets through the winter months of 1976-77 had become a matter of serious concern as some chanted 'Company police'. 75  Indeed on 3 May the Middlesex Crown Court found arrested pickets innocent. Moreover, the Willesden police were vigorously condemned and ordered to pay costs. 76 Dromey, arrested for chanting 'Company police', was acquitted. As the police presence grew, the relationship between them and the  pickets  became  an  important  issue,  particularly  because  of  the  use  of violence. The experience of Kantilal Patel, who was, in a rare moment, left alone  on  the  picket  line  during  a  change  of  duty,  was  cause  for  serious concern.  When  his  colleagues  returned,  they  found  him  'beaten  up  and bleeding  from  the  lip  and  cheek,  his  face  badly  bruised'. Although  there were no witnesses to prove who actually committed the act, when the police

were called in, it was alleged, although they were stationed less than a mile away,  'they  did  not  hurry'.  When  they  eventually  arrived,  'One  large policeman towered over Kanti and told him that he deserved what he got.' 77 The  relationship  between  the  police  and  the  immigrant  community  had deteriorated  so  much  that  Brent  Community Relations Council suspended all its formal links with the police.

Although no arrests were made in the month of May, on the 19th three government  ministers  had  joined  the  picket  line.  This,  however,  was  the calm  before  the  storm.  On  1  June,  Mrs  Jayaben  Desai  was  arrested  for 'assault' and 'exchanges' with George Ward and Malcolm Alden her former bosses. Later, following an appeal, she won her case.

So far the strikers had no reason to believe that they would get justice from  the  police.  They  felt  they  were  'up  against  the  police',  and  on  this basis, they called on the trade union movement to support a mass picket, for one week only, from 13 to 17 June. 78 The  strikers  had  experienced  many moments of disappointment particularly in that the trade union movement did not act swiftly and decisively to confront Grunwick when it flouted the ACAS report. Now in June 1977, over ten months since the strike began, they felt an urgent need for support, for the kind of solidarity reflected in Tom Durkin's words to the Brent Trades Council earlier in the year: 'there has been no struggle in Brent more glorious, none more courageous, than that  of  the  Grunwick  strikers  since  the  General  Strike  of  1926. The  trade union movement cannot afford their defeat.' 79

If May was a relatively calm and trouble-free month, in terms of police harassment and violence on the picket line, it also had the effect of arousing suspicions  and  doubts  as  to  the  outcome  of  their  struggle.  Two  of  the strikers made their feelings abundantly clear. Reflecting creeping bitterness, on 3 April, Mahmood Ahmed, Chairman of the Strike Committee, told 2000 trade unionists at the British Leyland Convenors' Conference in Birmingham  Town  Hall  that  TUC  promises  could  not  compensate  for effective action. Indeed, the TUC should approach the strikers, asking how they  could  help  rather  than  the  other  way  round.  He  added  finally,  what many  felt,  'If  the  British  trade  union  movement  wants  to  recruit  Asian workers, then it has to do better than this.' 80 Already real fears had set in, but the struggle continued.

The  mass  picket was  to bring home  via  television screens, the unforgettable scenes of the Grunwick Strike. Given the foregoing developments in the dispute by June 1977, the Strike had already become widely known in Britain. The Strike Committee's bulletins put forward this summary of the issues involved:

## IF THE STRIKE IS LOST

- 1. The right to organise will have been made a mockery of.
- 2. ACAS will have been discredited and the Employment Protection Act.
- 3. Millions  of  unorganised  workers  at  other  Grunwicks  will  be  discouraged  from  joining  a union.
- 4. The confidence of Asian and West Indian workers in our movement will be severely affected.
- 5. 'Sweat Shop' employers up and down the country will take heart. 81

Moreover, both the union and the strikers saw the necessity of a mass picket  to  stem  the  blows  dealt  to  the  working-class  movement.  For  the pattern of counter-attack had become clear in that whenever normal trade union pressures such as blacking and picketing were applied 'some upper class twit' appeared on television 'with a court writ in his hand'. Some felt the NAFF was making a nonsense of British industrial relations, and getting away with it.

Another important reason for calling a mass picket in June was because some two-thirds of Grunwick's business was carried out between June and September.  A  mass  picket  during  this  period  was  expected  to  cause disruption  to  this  trade.  One  of  the  aims  of  the  mass  picket  was  to  win support  from  the  blacklegs. The  summer  months  then  were  crucial  in  the joint strategy of the union, the Strike Committee and the Trades Council to bring about a speedy and peaceful settlement to the dispute. The language used by both sides during the dispute conjures up the image of battle lines being  drawn  for  an  inevitable  confrontation.  Indeed  'Blockading'  'Fort Grunwick'  were  common  expressions.  Clearly  they  were  not  'playing cricket'.  There  was  genuine  anger  and  outrage  among  members  of  the labour  movement.  Equally,  in  the  company  and  its  advisers  and  NAFF, there  was  animosity  and  contempt  for  the  strikers,  the  idea  of  trade unionism and their supporters on the picket line. Yet  'peaceful  picketing' was the intention.

The original and main aim of the mass picket was to get the maximum publicity for the strikers' cause. According to Dromey, the idea of a mass picket was that 'two hundred people would man the gates daily throughout the week from Monday 13 June, in a show of strength to demand action, particularly on essential services'. 82

The employer and the forces of law and order saw the intimidation of the blacklegs as a declaration of war by the presence of a mass picket. Fort Grunwick  had  to  be  fortified,  before  the  siege!  As  both  sides  made

preparations,  on  the  basis  of  past  experience,  they  were  surprised  by  the size  of  the  escalation  that  began  on  Monday  13  June,  the  first  day  of  the mass  picket. A  number  of  organisations  (including  women's  groups)  sent representatives  to  join  the  pickets  which  started  at  6am  at  Chapter  Road. Half  an  hour  later,  there  were  60  people.  These  movements  were  closely monitored.

In no nonsense 'mood' and in defence of the 'Fort', police chief Sadler demanded that the pickets  be  reduced  to  six  only. 83 This  had  no  basis  in law,  the  strikers  argued.  Once  again,  the  police  were  denying  the  strikers their rights.

The  police  moved  in,  'whiplashing  into  the  pickets  on  the  pavement' and arrested 84 pickets on that first day. According to one observer, there was 'no resistance' from the pickets. However, the police allegedly pulled, 'prodded  their  victims  on  with  kicks  and  punches,  irrespective  of  age  or sex'. Some policemen used this as the ideal opportunity to vent their racism and sexism.

On Tuesday  a  bus  was  used  to  drive  the  'loyal  workers'  through  the picket line. By the end of the day 11 of the 'loyal workers' had joined the strikers. Even two pay increases in six months and the might of the law to protect  them  could  not  maintain  their  loyalty  to  George  Ward  and  his company. That same day, the Special Patrol Group entered, for the first time in  British  labour  relations  history,  a  picket  line.  This  heavy  squad  further reinforced protection of the 'Fort'. Predictably, it called forth deep questioning among pickets. As one trade unionist put it: 'We're not bloody terrorists.' 84

On  Wednesday  that  week,  the Cricklewood  sorters launched the unofficial blacking of Grunwick mail on the advice of the UPW's London District Council. Support for the strikers came from some TGWU drivers, working for the police on contract (they refused to drive them to Chapter Road), and from the National Union of Bank Employees. And significantly, more 'loyal' Grunwick workers joined the strike. The next day, Grantham ready  to  seize  any  opportunity  for  negotiation  with  Grunwick  agreed  to meet Ward at Grunwick to 'exchange views'. This afternoon meeting turned out to be a meeting with the 'loyal workers' with whom Grantham tried to reason.  He  was  abused  and  his  presence  at  the  meeting  was  filmed. 85

According to one of the workers who later joined the strikers in July, Ward had plied his staff with alcoholic drinks. 86

On Friday morning 17 June, the last day of the mass picket, outraged trade  unionists  came  out  in  full  force.  Some  1500  had  gathered  near  the Chapter Road site. The picketing grew to outnumber, for the first time, the 700-strong police force. It was, perhaps, opportune that Dromey, on behalf of the Strike Committee, announced to the crowd that mass picketing would be extended for another week. The crowd approved.

The  strikers  had  come  through  a  battering  from  the  police  but  were nevertheless in buoyant mood. Mrs Desai's soreness and sadness gave way to  optimism  as  she  beheld  the  trade  union  banners  behind  which  a  solid mass  of  British  working  men  and  women  marched  in  support  of  the strikers'  struggle.  'When  they  talked  of  the  power  of  the  trade  union movement', she said, 'I listened but I didn't really believe. Now I see that power.'  What  Mrs  Desai  did  not  know  is  that  only  very  rarely  has  the British trade union movement come out en masse to demonstrate solidarity for a cause. This turnout made the Grunwick dispute special; an important event in British labour history. For the ruling class who predictably had to believe  in  law  and  order  to  protect  their  property,  this  massive  crowd  (a powerful  statement  in  opposition  to  an  oppressive  employer  and  police violence)  represented  a  real  threat  to  the  status  quo.  'Fort  Grunwick', symbolic  of  vested  interests,  had  to  be  protected.  Given  this  perspective, one  begins  to  understand  the  presence  of  the  SPG  that  Friday  morning which  sliced  through  the  crowds  'like  a  knife  through  butter'. 87 Their ferocious charges seemed unbelievable to eyewitnesses. Noticeably, as was the  case  on  Monday, the first day of the mass picket, the SPG seemed to single  out  only  women,  'rushing  us  like  animals',  as  one  woman  put  it. Although  Grunwick  had  made  even  bolder  headlines,  the  media  played down this attack on women. The next day, another 40 arrests were made.

The 'war' resumed on Monday 20 June, at the beginning of the second week  with  1200  pickets  at  Grunwick's  gates.  This  encouragement  to  the strikers was accentuated by a miners' vote to join the picket line, later in the week.  Monday  passed  with  relative  calm.  But,  on  Tuesday,  there  was violence again. There to witness the 'most violent scenes on the picket line so far', were Tribune MPs led by Ian Mikardo. After the bus delivering the 'loyal workers' had entered and left, a policeman allegedly laid hands on a

black man. According to Mikardo who witnessed the incident, it was likely that  the  man's  colour made him an easy and identifiable target. Whatever the provocation, this man was viciously attacked by three policemen. Soon more  policemen  charged  into  the  crowd  and  a  full-scale  confrontation ensued. Comparing this with the Cable Street battle in the 1930s, Mikardo said, 'At no one time during the course of the morning did we [the MPs] see anybody offer violence to the police of any sort. Nor did we see anything that could be called provocation other than vocal provocation.' 88 It seemed what constituted 'vocal provocation' was left to the discretion of individual police  officers,  as  indeed,  were  matters  to  do  with  the  'loyal  workers' decided at the discretion of Grunwick's managers. Thus, MP Audrey Wise's comment  to  a policeman who  was  dragging  a woman  picket, was interpreted as an arrestable offence.

Apart from the recklessness of the police, the high speed at which the workers'  bus  was  driven  through  the  factory  gates,  aroused  concern.  On Wednesday,  two  leading  Communists,  Mick  McGahey  (leader  of  the Scottish miners) and Gordon McLennan, General Secretary of the Communist  Party  in  Britain,  were  present  on  the  picket  line.  McLennan presented Mrs Desai with a £288 cheque, and McGahey,  after an enthusiastic  welcome,  addressed  the  'smallest'  crowd  of  the  week  with  a 'powerful speech'. George Ward was irked by McGahey's call to 'close the place  [Grunwick]  up  and  stop  that  industrial  hooligan  Mr  Ward  in  his tracks'. 89 He  went  on  to  assure  the  courageous  strikers:  'You  will  win  as night  follows  day  …  the  whole  of  the  Scottish  miners  will  come  here  if necessary.' Conscious of the escalation of the dispute into high politics, and the silence of certain organisations, he voiced a widespread feeling, 'I want to  see  marching  down  Chapter  Road  the  General  Council  of  the  TUC. Behind them I want to see the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. And behind them, the Parliamentary Labour Party led by the Prime Minister.'  The  crowd  applauded.  Confrontation  involving  the  people  was one  thing,  but  confrontation  involving  those  with  power  was  another. McGahey had put his finger on it: what was vitally necessary in the dispute, given all that had gone before, was confrontation; action from the strikers' supporters, no more words.

The  next  day  the  Yorkshire  miners  led  by Arthur  Scargill  responded. They came to Cooper Road and joined the 2000 pickets which was also the estimated number on the picket line on the following day. In anticipation of

the miners, the 'toughest' and 'most militant' section of the British working class,  the  police  and  SPG forces were ready for confrontation. In spite of the outrage at their behaviour during the first three days, the SPG charged into  the  crowd  again.  Scargill  and  many  of  his  colleagues  were  arrested. The  miners  were  taken  by  surprise.  As  one  of  them  put  it,  'This  is  not traditional British policemen  we  have  here.  These  here  are  thugs  in uniform.' 90

During the day's violence, PC Trevor Wilson was hit by a bottle. This, in spite of the Strike Committee's sympathy (Mrs Desai visited the injured policeman)  and  its  condemnation  of  violence  on  both  sides,  was  a  major setback  for  the  strikers  as  the  media  and  right-wingers,  advising  and supporting  Ward  blamed  'red  fascists'  and  painted  a  picture  of  an  allpowerful trade union movement which had driven poor George Ward to a secret destination, because he was 'suffering from exhaustion'. 91

Not all journalists  were  caught  up  in  'union-bashing'. Although  much damage was done, one journalist wrote: 'As usual it was not until there was violence that  the  BBC  or  ITN  or  most  newspapers  bothered  to  report  the issue.' 92

On  Friday  of  the  second  week  of  the  mass  picket,  there  were  an estimated 1,521 police. During this week, it had become clear to many that there was more 'calculation and premeditation' behind this presence. What was  this  'force'  designed  to  achieve?  Roy  Edwards,  Assistant  General Secretary of APEX, a 'moderate', offered his view. He felt that the violence was caused by the police who waded into the crowd with their fists, knees and boots and used their helmets and truncheons. '… I have seen action on picket lines many many times but I have never seen such brutality. It was unprovoked  and  I  think  it  was  planned  in  advance  to  discredit  the pickets.' 93

The two weeks of mass picketing provided the politicians with two pegs on which they hung their arguments - picketing and law and order. Merlyn Rees, who had earlier said, 'this kind of activity [violence against police] I know, has no place in responsible trade unionism', after visiting the scene on  Monday  27  June,  defended  this  policy  of  policing  which  led  to  the violence thus: 'I learnt this in Northern Ireland: operational control must be in the hands of the police.' 94

As far as the strikers were concerned, neither the Strike Committee, the Trades Council nor APEX could have predicted the massive support they received or what had happened on the picket lines. Neither were they to be blamed. 'The union, we are satisfied', the Scarman Court of Inquiry stated, 'had no intention of provoking violence and disorder by calling for the mass picket.' 95 It  was  on  the  last  day  of  that  historic  month  that Albert  Booth announced this Court of Inquiry.

What  did  the  mass  picket  in  June  achieve?  Firstly,  the  mass  support mobilised  helped  to  get  more  of  Grunwick's  'loyal  workers'  to  join  the strikers;  secondly,  it  brought  about  an  unselfish  act  of  solidarity  amongst postal workers to boycott Grunwick's mail; and thirdly, it helped to bring into being the Scarman Court of Inquiry into the dispute.

With the support of NAFF, Ward was able to mount 'Operation Pony Express'  and  get  round  the  blacking  of  the  company's  mail  by  the Cricklewood sorters who continued their action, in spite of suspension by their union. Significantly, since the strike started, this small group of postal workers had done more in directly affecting the Grunwick business than the 20,000 pickets at the gate.

The  'Operation'  (a  classic  strike-breaking  exercise)  consisted  of  a strange little convoy of a 40-foot container lorry, two cars, a large box lorry and  a  mini-bus  with  about  25  volunteers  on  board.  An  hour  after  they arrived at lam on Saturday 9 July, Grunwick's backlog of mail was safely out of its premises. Proudly, Ward quoted one of his supporters saying, 'It was the best thing since Entebbe.' 96

Given  the  mounting  support  and  interest  in  their  cause,  in  order  to maintain the momentum, the Strike Committee called for a 'day of action' on  11  July.  That  day  a  'super-picket'  of  20,000  people  had  assembled  to demonstrate  against  the  company.  And  significantly,  seven  more  'loyal workers'  joined  the  strikers.  The  'day  of  action'  was  supported  by  the Yorkshire miners. Again in a gesture of solidarity they joined the strikers. As Scargill said, 'We haven't fought for trade union rights for two centuries to  give  them  away  in  the  back  streets  of  Willesden.' 97 The  spectacular march with brilliant trade union banners and the meeting that followed in Roundwood Park, involved relatively little or no violence. However, there was  a  mood  of  anger  among  many  in  the  crowd  that  the  speakers  who addressed  them  did  not  include  members  of  the  Strike  Committee,  the

Trades Council or the Union of Post Office Workers. Only after shouts for Desai, Dromey and Durkin did Dromey tell the thousands 'The mass picket must go on'. 98

The media was again disappointed by this extraordinary demonstration against a small company. They attacked the pickets as 'mobsters' inciting 'mob rule' and singled out 'megalomaniacal Mr Scargill'. 99

The  following  day,  Lord  Widgery  gave  the  High  Court  judgement  in favour of ACAS against Grunwick. Widgery felt that ACAS was correct in regarding the strikers as workers whose views should have been taken into account  on  the  issue  of  union  recognition  and  that  ACAS  had  sought through every means possible to get the views of Grunwick's employees, but this was frustrated by refusal to provide their names and addresses. In the light of this judgement, the Prime Minister asked both sides to accept the High Court ruling. George Ward might have been down, but not out. He replied, 'We shall go to the Court of Appeal and on legal advice if necessary to the Lords.' 100

Friday  29  July  was  indeed  'Black  Friday'.  Firstly,  the  postal  workers voted to end their blacking, secondly the Grunwick strikers voted to call off their 8 August mass picket, and thirdly, Lord Denning ruled that the Appeal Court should allow Grunwick's appeal against the earlier High Court ruling of 12 July, thus invalidating the ACAS report. 101

The long, hard struggle of the migrant trade unionists had begun to take its  toll.  The  earlier  support  of  the  two  unions, APEX  and  the  UPW,  was faltering.  Jayaben  Desai  wept  outside  the  Brent  Trades  Hall.  After  '49 weeks, rain and snow', and being dragged by her hair by a policeman, she asked, 'was it for this?' She commented  on  Grantham,  the lapsed 'moderate' who after the euphoria of the earlier weeks, became again a true catholic:  he  threatened  to  'cut  off  our  strike  pay'.  There  was  also  bitter disappointment  from  members  of  the  UPW  Cricklewood  Branch  whose Chairman, Colin Maloney said, 'our union leadership has done something that George Ward, John Gorst and the NAFF failed to do. They forced us back.'

At the beginning of August, the Brent Trades Council responded to this clear slackening of support for the strikers. They accused the government and trade union leadership of forcing a retreat on the Strike Committee and the Cricklewood postmen. The rank and file was being dictated to by their

executive  and  the  gap  was  widening  between  the  Strike  Committee  and APEX.  When  the  postmen  unwillingly  returned  to  Work  the  next  day, ACAS announced that they would challenge the High Court decision in the Lords.  And  in  the  continuing  unpredictability  of  official  trade  union support,  the  following  week,  the  TUC  adopted  a  resolution  calling  for increased financial and political aid for the strikers.

Already  the  strikers'  disillusionment  was  becoming  evident.  Hitherto they  had  fought  and  lost  many  battles,  yet,  they  were  hopeful.  On  25 August,  the  Scarman  Report  was  published.  The  report  called  for  union recognition  and  reinstatement  while  criticising  the  mass  picket  and  the postal blacking. This was seen as a victory by APEX who had listed five background issues to the strike: (i) low pay; (ii) long hours with compulsory overtime;  (iii)  petty  restrictions  on  workers;  (iv)  management's  attitude towards supervision; and (v) frequent dismissals.

In  essence,  the  report  emphasised  belief  in  the  British  tradition  of compromise  through  collective  bargaining  and  the  need  for  workers  and employers  to  act reasonably. Scarman  commented  on  the  vulnerable immigrant  workforce  who  were  'particularly  at  risk'  in  that  they  were employed  in  fiercely  competitive  businesses  where  low  prices  and  rapid service brought  great rewards. 102 He  also  felt the genuine  sense  of discontent  and  grievances  could  not  be  dealt  with  since  there  was  no effective machinery through which this could be done. Grunwick's Works Committee was woefully inadequate for dealing with these grievances. He felt  that  Malcolm Alden's  attitude  towards  workers  was  a  real  source  of discontent in the mail order department. Indeed, in this context, he became, as  Dromey put it, 'advocate, judge, jury and hangman in his own cause'. Grunwick according to Scarman,

by dismissing all the strikers, refusing to reconsider the reinstatement of any of them, refusing to seek a negotiated settlement  to  the  strike  and  rejecting ACAS  offers  of  conciliation, has acted within the letter but outside the spirit of the law. Further, such  action  on  the  part  of  the  company  was  unreasonable  when judged  by  the  norms  of  good  industrial  relations  practice.  The company  has  thus  added  to  the  bitterness  of  the  dispute,  and contributed to its development into a threat of civil disorder. 103

In his balancing act, on the other hand, Scarman also criticised the mass picketing  and  the  unofficial  boycott.  Overall  then,  the  Scarman  Report findings, broadly in favour of the union, were welcomed by APEX, but a harder  line  was  taken  by  the  Strike  Committee  and  the  Trades  Council. Indeed, it was hoped it would provide the basis for a negotiated settlement, that the question of recognition would not be allowed to drag on. 104 Ahmed, Desai,  Gandhi  and  Dromey  were  all  pleased  at  the  vindication  of  their stand, but were acutely aware that the strike was not yet over. Furthermore they were concerned that Scarman's recommendation concerning a government  review  of  the  law  on  picketing  might  lead  to  further  legal restriction on the right to picket. At that moment, Ward was the only real threat  to  a  quick  and  peaceful  settlement.  Wary  of  the  NAFF  and Ward's response, the strikers in a letter to the union Executive Committee warned: 'We  are  firmly  convinced  that  it  would  be  a  major  mistake  to  lose  this golden  opportunity  and  to  allow  Ward  to  think  that,  in  our  anxiety  for  a negotiated settlement, we might be weakening.' 105 Dromey supported this view.

As many had predicted on 31 August, Grunwick rejected the Scarman Report. The NAFF dismissed it as having 'no legal force' and after APEX's 'olive branch' Ward responded on 1 September with his 'Counter Scarman Report' which was published in The Times and the Telegraph .

Never  under  any  circumstances  will  the  company  reinstate  those who were, very properly,  dismissed. The  suggestion  is  completely impracticable as the existing reinstatement would be a surrender to rampant illegality, brute force, and the coercive power of a mighty vested interest that seeks not to reason but to compel. 106

Hours later, he received the support of Sir Keith Joseph who condemned the Scarman Report.

Time  was  running  out,  and  the  strikers  felt  the  moment  had  come  to have  a  showdown  with  their  union  officials.  Indeed,  when  they  met Grantham and Deputy General Secretary, Tudor Thomas, 'bitter exchanges' marked a long meeting. The strikers argued for a motion on the question of action in essential services to be moved at the TUC Conference, a few days later. The strikers' optimism of the result of such a meeting came to grief as Grantham  announced  that  the  motion  had  already  been  sent  to  the  TUC

General  Secretary  in  Blackpool.  In  effect,  it  was  now  much  too  late  to discuss  essential  services  and  of  course  (conveniently  or  not)  he  did  not have a copy with him. He assured the Strike Committee, however, that in lieu of reference to essential services the unions would be asked to increase their  'financial  and  practical  support'.  Grantham,  the  'moderate'  trade unionist was behaving true to form and in doing so, had effectively denied the strikers any degree of real success in the strike. According to Dromey, a leading TUC  General  Council  member,  who  could  not  'understand' Grantham, said: 'The motion is as weak as piss. He could have asked for the moon and Congress would have given it to him.' Instead, he assured the strikers  that  action  would  be  taken after Congress  had  met,  to  affect essential services to the company. 107

What could explain this incredible behaviour of Grantham following the Scarman Report. Dromey was accurate in stating that 'the Court of Inquiry did precisely what the Government set it up to achieve and what suited the majority of the TUC General Council: the battle was moved off the streets, the mass picketing was brought under control and the 'illegal' blacking of Grunwick's mail was ended'. 108

Indeed, neither Tom Jackson (UPW) or Frank Chapple of the EETPU were interested in taking action on essential services. In fact, one observer wrote: 'The mood among trade unionists at Blackpool was of embarrassment  at  getting dragged  into battle. …  The  principal  preoccupation in TUC minds now is how to get out of the affair gracefully and with the minimum loss of face. The same is true of Ministers and Labour MPs, who have become noticeably reluctant to comment or get involved in the past few weeks.' 109

In  a  last  desperate  attempt  to  win TUC  support,  the  strikers  leafletted delegates at the 109th Annual Congress in September 1977. After the TUC General  Council's  failure  to  act  on  essential  services,  the  strikers,  not relishing  the  prospect  of  returning  to  the  streets  and  the  impact  on  local residents,  unanimously  agreed  to  a  resumption  of  the  mass  picketing  on Monday 17 October. It was hoped that the mass picket would put pressure on  the  company  and  arouse  interest  and  support  for  action  on  essential services.  On  Monday  17  October  some  5000  pickets  assembled  outside Grunwick. In mounting its last desperate battle, the Strike Committee called for another day of action on Monday, 7 November. After 14 months their

energy had not flagged: they believed in trade unionism and were guided in this belief by left-wing trade unionists. As the Strike Committee saw it, they had two choices: to sit it out until the Lords' decision or to pursue action on essential services. 110

Three days before the 'Day of Reckoning' seven MPs, Neil Kinnock, Audrey Wise, Ron Thomas, Jo Richardson, Martin Flannery, Ian Mikardo and Dennis Skinner, joined the pickets at Chapter Road. As the interest and support for the strikers intensified during the weekend prior to the 'day of action',  Mahmood Ahmad said 'even in the event of winning, there is no legal way of getting our jobs back'. 111

By the afternoon of the 'Day of Reckoning' 8000 pickets had assembled to demonstrate their support for the strikers' cause; a 'magnificent tribute' to the trade union movement after 63 weeks, said the Strike Committee. The day  was  marred,  however,  by  'one  of  the  worst  attacks  upon  pickets  in living  memory.'  Two  hundred  and  forty-three  pickets  received  injuries inflicted  by  the  police  and  113  were  arrested. 112 Police  brutality  was 'organised and indiscriminate'. This policy of 'unbridled savagery' involved an attack 'from behind by several hundred policemen'. 113

The Strike Committee wondered how  much  more  violence was necessary before the TUC and the unions providing essential services would take action to force recognition and reinstatement. Winter had come again and  another  Day  of  Action  was  called  for  early  December.  The  Strike Committee appealed to APEX for support. But APEX had grown weary of the long battle and the strikers had failed to win the support of their own union and the EEPTU, GMWU and the UPW.

The frail Mrs Desai had not bargained for this physically, mentally and spiritually  demanding  struggle  when  she  walked  out  of  Grunwick's  mail order department on 20 August 1976. After a tortuous 15-month picket in all weathers, facing police hatred and violence, victory seemed as far away as ever.

On  21  November,  as  a  final  act  of  protest  in  line  with  the  Gandhian technique, she was joined by Vipin Magdani, Johnny Patel and Yasu Patel on hunger strike on the steps of TUC Headquarters on Great Russell Street. This  hunger  strike  met  the  displeasure  of  APEX  and  the  TUC.,  not  the support they had hoped for. And for good measure, Mahmood and Gandhi who  had  joined  the  hunger  strikers,  had  their  membership  in APEX  and

strike pay withdrawn. In effect, they were, at that stage, non-union members powerless  to  act.  Suddenly  their  struggle  for  trade  union  recognition  had become  a  bitterly  disappointing  exercise;  they  were  disciplined  by  their employer, the police, and now incredibly by their own union!

For the strikers, more disappointment was on the way. On 14 December, the House of Lords supported Denning's defence of Grunwick in the ACAS appeal. Christmas 1977 was not a happy time. The winter and the turn of the  New Year  were  bleak. An  attempt  by  the  Strike  Committee  to  renew mass  picketing  in April  1978  failed.  Moreover,  the  strikers  were  bitterly disappointed that the union's annual conference held in May 1978 refused to  take  industrial  action.  Instead,  it  was  agreed  to  call-off  the  dispute  if ACAS did not within five weeks again recommend recognition. The strikers and their union had drifted further apart. After George Ward had dismissed ACAS as the 'Association for the Advancement of Socialism', in May, on 14 July, the Strike Committee, nearly two years after it began, announced the bitter end of the Grunwick Strike.

## The bitter lessons

The lessons of the earlier strikes (fundamentally that black workers needed to rally the community behind them and from that base force the unions to their side) had been unlearnt by workers who had not had the benefit of that tradition.  On  the  other  hand,  the  persistence  and  courageousness of Asian women  in  maintaining  the  picket  lines,  month  after  month,  against  the pressure of some members of their community, the deception of the union and attacks of the SPG, with support from the white women's group, had established the strength of the emerging black women's movement.

The Grunwick Strike, viewed as part of the history of Asian workers' struggles  in  Britain,  had  some  significant  distinguishing  features.  Earlier struggles by these workers came to fruition in this strike in that hitherto, it showed  the  determination  to  abolish  the  relationship  between  sweated labour and sweatshop owners; a cause which had been spotlighted nationally.  The  dispute  was  historic  in  that  the  small Asian  workforce  on strike was able to win massive support from various sections of the white working class.

But, in spite of the massive publicity and trade union support throughout  Britain,  the  Grunwick  Strike  demonstrated  that  a  victory  (for example,  a  path  out  of  the  deadlock  between  the  strikers,  the  union  and management)  was  only  possible  if  the  lessons  of  the  earlier  struggles  by black workers in the previous ten years was unlearnt. Given the circumstances,  this  could  only  be  effected  through  the  emergence  of  an 'autonomous leadership', capable of an international appeal, free from the 'traps  inherent  in  unionism'.  Thus  the  celebrated  Grunwick  Strike  taught the black working class bitter lessons.

It is therefore necessary to focus on the central question in the dispute, 'The  right  to  join a union',  and  the  strategy  adopted  by  the  Strike Committee. The newly proletarianised East African Asians, eager to redress their workplace grievances, wanted to be unionised. They sought the help of experienced trade unionists. Indeed, from the first day of the walkout, the strategies adopted by the strikers were led and dominated by Jack Dromey and the Brent Trades Council. Dromey was from the Left of the trade union movement.  He  believed  the  trade  unions  could  be  used  as  vehicles  for positive action. Thus placing the Asian workers' trust in the union, a Strike

Committee  was  formed  and  an  attack  on  three  fronts  was  launched.  But why did these attacks fail?

Firstly, although widespread support was received through the appeal of the 'fundamental right of unionisation' the leadership of the strike chose to use this  support  on  the  picket  line  as  a  publicity  weapon  rather  than  as  a force  to  stop  the  bus  carrying  blacklegs  into  the  factory.  In  effect,  while mass confrontation took place between the police and the pickets outside the  factory,  inside  it  there  was  business  as  usual  for  Grunwick  Film Processing  Laboratories.  Secondly,  the  Strike  Committee's  strategy  of seeking support from the rank and file and particularly of trade unionists in other  trades,  left  much  to  be  desired.  And  thirdly,  the  Strike  Committee agreed  to  use  the  machinery  of  state  to  settle  their  dispute  with  George Ward of the Grunwick Company. 114

On  reflection,  the  strike  revealed  that  the  power  of  Asian  workers, accumulated through years of shopfloor battles against opposition from the white union power structure and management treachery, had been defused in the potentially explosive Grunwick confrontation. The Grunwick workers, like their predecessors in sweatshops elsewhere in Britain did not walk  out  of  the  job  primarily  on  the  issue  of  union  entry.  Indeed,  they walked out because they were prepared to tolerate no longer the abuse, the exploitation,  low  wages  and  unbearable  conditions  (heavily  overlaid  with fear) at their workplace.

In 1974 workers at Imperial Typewriters were fighting 'the slavery of it all'. One of the leading lights among the Grunwick strikers, Jayaben Desai, said,  'The  treatment  we  got  was  worse  than  the  slaves  in Roots .'  These workers  were  echoing  a  common  historical  experience.  Moreover,  the Grunwick  strike  clearly  showed  that  this  rank  and  file  militancy  was  at cross-purposes with the trade union spokesmen. As Race Today commented: 'What we are witnessing is a takeover bid for the independent movement  of  Asian  workers  by  the  left-wing  of  the  labour  movement, whose immediate interest is to keep the union kite flying.' 115

Trade union activists such as Arthur Scargill and Jack Dromey saw the Grunwick struggle as being symbolic of the fundamental right of a worker to belong to a trade union. In this respect, the Grunwick strikers have been likened  to  the  Tolpuddle  Martyrs  and  the  East  End  Match  Girls.  But,  of course, this was not the tradition from which the Grunwick workers came.

The emotional appeal to defend unionism succeeded in getting the support of thousands of white workers to the Grunwick picket lines. However, this did not mean that the white workers were there to support a strike by black workers.  Indeed  given  the  experience  of  black  workers  in  earlier  strikes, this had yet to happen. The white workers were there simply on the issue of 'defending the trade union movement'.

In  effect  then,  the  strategy  that  the  Grunwick  strikers  had  subsumed themselves to was a complete denial of their own history. From the outset of the Grunwick  walkout,  the  strikers  had  been  led  to  believe  that mobilising white workers had to be their prime purpose. Fourteen months later, with no victory in sight, the strikers appealed to black workers in other parts of the country  for support  by  issuing  a  leaflet as part of its mobilisation for the 'Day of Reckoning' on 7 November. This appeal to all Asian  workers  stated  that  the  dispute  was  of  vital  importance  'for  our community and the whole trades union movement. If Ward and the National Association  for  'Freedom'  defeat  us,  then  immigrant  workers  will  have been denied the right to join a trade union.' 116

Not surprisingly, this appeal was ignored. The history of black workers and their experience of trade unions in Britian have forced them to create their own methods and means of struggle. As all previous black movements had  done,  at  one  point  or  another  (and  certainly  within  the  10  years preceding the strike), the movement of Blacks internally and the activities of young Blacks and black workers in Britain had thrown up race into the forefront of the struggle (as a daily lived experience) and thus laid the basis for  a  powerful  national  and  international  linkage  of  black  struggles.  This source remained untapped during the Grunwick dispute.

The  central  lesson  of  the  Grunwick  dispute  then  was  that  in  spite  of years of demonstrated strength to sections of the white working class, trade unionism  was  found  inadequate  to  deal  with  their  wider  and  special problems. The issue was not simply 'trade union recognition'; in fact, it was an issue based on race and class. The absence of a trade union or even a modicum of grievance machinery in the Grunwick factory was a reflection of this. Also of crucial significance to the black community was the fact that both  the  Grunwick,  Imperial  Typewriters  and  earlier  strikes  had  smashed forever the myth of the passive Asian woman.

The foregoing strikes  involved  mainly Asian  workers.  Simultaneously their 'sisters' from the Caribbean were also waging a hard struggle against

the National Health Service and other employers.

## Black Caribbean women: nurses and ancillary workers

To many black Caribbean women, migration to Britain meant some change in  terms  of  status.  Among  rural  Jamaican  women  who  had  migrated  to Britain,  of  particular  importance  to  the  changes  in  their  lives  were  the patterns of work and the control of economic resources. In fact, work has in many cases played the positive role of providing the economic support for women's independence. In London, for example, isolation  from  relatives, loneliness and boredom at home is alleviated at work, which provides the opportunity  to  meet  other  people,  to  socialise  and  perhaps  to  learn  new skills.  Moreover, this economic underpinning, it was argued could disrupt close-knit networks, thus engendering a greater sense of independence. 117

In 1974 for the first time nurses came out on strike in support of their demands for more money. Earlier, in 1972, auxiliary workers were among the first in bringing the strike weapon to the hospital. In doing so, they had acted in opposition to the myth that women administering to the sick, the young and the old should not behave in this 'unprofessional' way. Seen in historical perspective, this strike was but a manifestation of a long struggle.

Nursing, the 'caring profession' nurtured in the traditions of the family and  in  waged  employment  in  Britain  and  her  former  colonies,  brought generations  of  black  women  conditioned  to  think  in  this  way  into  British hospitals. There is  then  a  historical  connection  between  nationalisation  of the  British  Health  Service  in  1948  and  the  migration  of  hospital  workers with this tradition. 118

A health service covering the whole working class (and not just those who  could  afford  it)  meant  a  massive  recruitment  of  low-wage  workers whose conditions of service could not seriously be challenged. But in the 20 years leading up to this first nurses' strike, the class composition of nursing had changed. In 1874, this was said of nurses: 'Many gentlewomen were recruited  because  it  is  the  belief  that  this  type  of  nursing  required  the highest type of women who were well educated.' One hundred years later, this was clearly not the case, and clearly did not reflect the recruiting policy of  the  National  Health  Service.  In  fact,  what  used  to  be  a  vocation  for

women of  the  middle  class  in  the  nineteenth  century  was  now  a job for women  of  the  working  class,  particularly  for  black  and  other  migrant women. Black women were responsive to the idea of service, regardless of the circumstances. Interestingly unlike the high-brow status which nursing had enjoyed in the nineteenth century, in recent years, black nurses found it to be a job that few Englishwomen wanted.

Overseas student nurses had been a major source of cheap labour for the British Health Service. The number of these nurses increased rapidly each year. In 1959 some 6000 arrived; by 1970 there were 19,000. 119  They came mainly from the Caribbean, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Malaysia (and Ireland). Their desire to train as nurses was not always the paramount reason for their decision  to  come  to  Britain.  However,  once  here  they  were  contracted  to work for the NHS for at least five years. In a new country and hopeful, they were willing to work hard and tolerate initial exploitation and harassment in the hope that things would get better. Indeed (unknown to them) many were deliberately  directed  to  take  the  (SEN)  State  Enrolled  Nurse  training  and qualification, instead of the SRN, the State Registered Nurse qualification. As it was, the SEN qualification was of no use to them outside Britain. At best,  however,  it  guaranteed  a  trained,  low-paid  workforce  on  the  ward floor.  One  way  in  which  women  from  overseas  were  directed  into  SEN training  was  by  demanding  educational  qualifications  for  the  SRN  which they were not likely to possess.

Moreover, during their stay in Britain, they had to renew their permits through the hospital every six months. In addition they undertook to stay in Britain  for  a  stipulated  period  of  time  after  their  training,  so  that  Britain could benefit from 'the training she has paid for'. Throughout her training, it was abundantly clear that the SEN pupil nurse repaid for her training 'a million times over by the cheap labour she provided'. Understandably, there was  no  deviation  from  this  policy  which  was  fully  implemented  and reflected  by  the  fact  that  in  1972  only  120  qualified  nurses  were  allowed into Britain.

But  how  was  this  labour  allocated  (stratified)  in  the  National  Health Service? Labour in the hospital was divided according to sex, race and age. Different jobs were done by people in different uniforms, getting different wages  and  having  different  degrees  of  power.  Significantly,  though  (as black  workers  have  come  to  expect),  those  who  worked  hardest  had  the least status and the least wages. During training as an SEN, a pupil nurse

aged 21 during the first year of training, received an allowance of £1065 out of  which  a  lodging  charge  of  £120  was  deducted.  The  salary  scales  for qualified SENs were: Enrolled Nurse, £1203-1455 with a lodging charge of £162; a Senior Enrolled Nurse, £1380-£1755 with a lodging charge of £192. The  next  and  lowest  grade  was  the  unqualified  nursing  staff,  the  nursing auxiliaries.  These  workers  at  the  age  of  21  received  a  yearly  income  of £1053-£1293 and had to pay a lodging charge of £120. 120  Given that the prospects  for  promotion  for  these  two  grades  were  virtually  nil,  the exploitation becomes even more oppressive.

These  divisions  within  the  hierarchy  were  reinforced  by  the  division between the 'professionals' and those who were not. While in theory every one had a chance of promotion, in practice very few got one promotion and fewer still  more  than  one. There  were  two  types  of  training. There  was  a two-year course leading to an SEN qualification which, in effect, could not lead to promotion. A large number of Asians, Irish and West Indians were deliberately directed to become SENs.

For  the  unsuspecting  new  trainee,  the  trap  was  carefully  laid.  'When you are interviewed', said one nurse, 'they ask you if you want to do the course in two years or three, and all of us said we would like to do the two year course. It's only when you get here that you realise that if you do two years, you will be an SEN.' 121 The SRN, on the other hand, goes through a three-year training and it is this qualification that gives a nurse the potential for promotion.

Black women are predominantly employed in the lower grades, serving doctors,  'professional'  nurses  and  patients.  Indeed,  so  discouraging  were their  promotion  chances  that  few  black  nurses  entered  the  NHS  as  a vocation in the hope of becoming a matron. For the ever hopefuls who did, it  very  soon  became  clear  that  'this  is  not  what  they  have  been  recruited for'.  For  black  women  nursing  is  essentially  a  job,  nothing  more.  By refusing to treat it as a vocation they were not only exposing the real nature of nursing in the health services, but were undermining the hierarchy which is  so  dependent  on  their  'wanting  to  be  part  of  it'.  For  many  nurses,  the stark realism has led to despair.

Together, black nurses and ancillary workers have laboured in the NHS in large numbers for more than a generation. Their cumulative experiences led to justified resentment and the dire need for change.

## Agency nurses

Given low pay, bad working conditions and unsociable hours of work, the disgruntled black nurses sought alternatives. Thus, agency nursing became an  attractive  proposition  and  'a  force  for  change  in  the  National  Health Service'.  The  switch  to  agency  nursing  was  dramatic.  Between  1972  and 1974, the number of nursing agencies and nurses 'mushroomed'. For those who were married, agency work provided a flexible alternative to working in the Health Service. Agency work was especially concentrated in London where  the  teaching  hospitals'  demand  relied  heavily  on  agency  supply  to ease their labour problems. The DHSS figures showed that on 30 September 1971  'the  equivalent  of  2720  agency  nurses  and  midwives  working  the whole time were being employed in the area of central London and the four Metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards … 54 per cent were employed in the teaching hospitals which employed only 11 per cent of NHS nursing and midwifery staff'. 122

Having found an alternative to the deplorable conditions and treatment of the NHS, agency nurses were made a focus for attack. According to one report this attack came from within the 'profession'. For example, from the union executive of COHSE, and from 'so-called revolutionary organisations'. They were all united that NHS nurses should refuse to work with agency nurses. By August 1974 COHSE was adamant that its ban on working with agency nurses should remain permanent. Further support was given by the National Rank and File Organising Committee whose journal Hospital Worker also called for a complete end to the use of agency nurses. In addition, Women's Voice (paper of International Socialist Women) said: 'At  our  first  meeting  we  decided  that  the  best  action  would  be  to  ban working with agency nurses. There's 300 in King's [Hospital] and £12,500 a  week  is  spent  on  them  -  the  hospital  would  collapse  without  them.  Of course it's hard on them, but if they're bothered about the state of nursing they should be in the NHS fighting with us.' 123

Fortunately the black nurses would not be drawn by this facile catch-all argument  of  workers'  solidarity  within  the  NHS.  In  their  experience,  the 'labour aristocracy' within the labour movement worked against the lower grades.  Without  a  complete  separation,  in  other  words  an  autonomous organisation  of  black  workers,  they  realised  their  case  could  not  be  fully represented. A  break  from  the  NHS  by  black  nurses  was  predictably  not

appreciated by those who were dependent on them. Indeed those who called on  black  agency  nurses  to  fight  with  them  within  the  NHS  failed  to appreciate the black nurses' dilemma.

By  1971,  the  reality  was  that  the  National  Health  Service  wage  rose with  seniority  from  grade  to  grade.  If  a  nurse  broke  her  service,  for example, by having children, she lost all seniority and the wage that went with it. When she rejoined she had to begin again working her way up the scale.  Because  this  kind  of  penalisation  excluded  almost  all  black  nurses from rejoining, increasingly they turned to agency work since they had no choice.  Furthermore,  black  nurses  with  children,  because  of  inadequate child care facilities at a price which they could afford, were forced in many cases  to  work  the  night-shift  in  order  to  care  for  their  children  and  get through their housework during daytime.

The money earned by black agency nurses aroused wild exaggeration. In fact, even in this kind of nursing there was colour discrimination. Some agencies operated a pay scale for white nurses and a lower one for black nurses. A  black  nurse,  told  never  to  discuss  her  wages,  said,  'I  did  and  I discovered  that  Australian  nurses  were  getting  more.'  Yet,  black  nurses found  agency  work  more  acceptable  than  employment  in  the  NHS.  A Jamaican nurse who started as a nursing auxiliary and later  trained  as  an SEN explained why she was doing agency work:

Most  of  the  night  staff  are  black.  Night  nurses  are  black  because they have children and it's more convenient for them to be at home in  the  days  to  see  after  the  children.  If  you  work  days  you're  not there  to  send  them  off  to  school,  you're  not  there  to  receive  them when they come back, and you have to get somebody to look after them. With nights, you can actually put them off to bed before going to work. I support the strike wholeheartedly. Nurses are saying they won't  work  with  agency  nurses  and  I  think  they're  being  silly, because number one, they should find out why nurses have to go to the  agency,  because  in  my  case  it's  not  because  I  wanted  to  but because I was forced to … I can't do without working …

On the question of the money earned by black agency nurses there had been wild exaggeration by the NHS  lobby.  In  fact, as many  have complained,  there  was  colour  discrimination  in  this  kind  of  nursing.  The

divide  and  rule  strategy  was  nothing  new  to  black  workers.  Interestingly, among women workers, a black/white  distinction  was  made.  Racism  and sexism were brought into play in creating schisms and outright divisions to maintain  the  profitability  of  capital.  The  Black  Women's  Group  saw  the struggle of black members as related to the NHS and agency nursing thus:

The  nursing  workforce appears to  be  divided  by  different  unions and professional bodies, but they are not. In this case the divisions between unions need not divide workers, and may even be helpful since  nurses  are  getting  together  across  trade  union  barriers.  Nontrade union workers (and that includes Agency nurses) are therefore not excluded by the workers' own way of organising. The divisions that are dangerous are between first, nursing and non-nursing staff, and  second,  NHS  and  agency  nurses  -  divisions  among  hospital workers. They  must  come  together  and  refuse  these  divisions  that the  government, unions and the Left are trying to deepen. Racism and  sexism  are  not  about  whether  you  take  position  with  black women, agency or non-agency, auxiliary, SRN or SEN. 124

They argued that the agency nurse was the first to refuse being tied to the  hospital  hierarchy,  thereby  confronting  the  blackmail  that  faced  all nurses. For example, that they were caring 'professionals' and not workers; that  the  issues,  which  created  the  agency  nurse  were  fundamental  to  all nurses and in fact, to all women. Here the unity necessary to make a fight was expected to come only when NHS nurses joined with agency nurses to raise these issues. Moreover, they stated that black nurses had been accused of  not  participating  militantly  in  the  struggle.  Indeed,  accusations  against agency nurses were based on the racism inherent in the hospital hierarchy.

## Black women and the black community

In  1971  for  the  first  time,  the  night  cleaners  came  out  on  strike.  In  their protracted  struggle  they  demanded  more  money,  shorter  hours  of  work, modern  equipment  and  the  right  to  have  their own union.  Of  major importance, this workforce comprised a large number of immigrant women of  whom West Indians formed a large percentage. According to the 1971 Census, in the West Indian community women outnumbered men (130,300

to 127,300), 125 yet  by  1975, little had been said about the quality of their lives in relation to British capital and their resistance to it.

In 1975 five black women auxiliaries (hospital ancillary workers) were elected by their fellow workers to represent them on the negotiating team which  had  talks  with  the  government  during  the  'pay-beds'  dispute  at Westminster  Hospital,  London.  Racist  elements  in  British  society  were quick to respond with hundreds of abusive letters and a bomb. 126

This representation marked a new stage in the struggle of West Indian women in Britain. Indeed, it smashed the myth (a gross over-simplification) that West Indian women of that generation were non-participants in militant action. One of five women on the negotiating team had this to say about the dispute:

The dispute arose when, because of a shortage of staff, management decided to close 48 beds in NHS wards while all the private wards remained  open.  We  auxiliaries  went  on  a  work  to  rule  in  protest against that decision. … My first experience of strike action was in 1972. We did not stay out very long. We wanted more money. At that  time  we  worked  in  the  hospital  scrubbing  and  cleaning.  You came to work at 7.00am and went home at midday, back again at 2.00pm and left at 7.00pm and at the end of the week you had £10 in your hand.

It was  a wonderful experience striking. We  marched  and shouted. From 1972 to today we have had to fight for everything we have since won. Now we no longer work the split shift but we work harder  than  before  because  after  1974  they  introduced  the  bonus system - where before there were four of us to a ward now there are only two. 127

One  of  her  major  complaints  concerned  the  problems  black  workers faced with patients and doctors alike.

These women were representatives of that section of West Indians who came to Britain during the early years of immigration. As part of a 'defeated and demoralised' section of the Caribbean working class, they arrived in a 'hostile'  country,  to  be  employed  in  the  worst  jobs  with  the  lowest  wage. They were crucial in laying the foundations of the black community as we know it today. They showed patience and also a capacity to fight which 'is

not  a  phenomenon  new  to  their  presence  in  Britain'.  In  fact,  it  was  a continuation  of  their  struggle  in  the  Caribbean.  For  many  years  their rebellion in the British workforce (particularly in the NHS) has been muted, underplayed and ignored. This tendency was rooted in the past.

In the anti-colonial struggles in the Caribbean, women threw themselves into the Independence movements whose leaders promised a brighter future for everyone, if they were voted into power. In defeating British colonialism, the activities of women helped to bring working class leaders to power: for example, Bustamante in Jamaica and Eric Gairy in Grenada. Indeed, women were the 'organisational backbone' of the political parties, forming  their  own  sections  within  them  and  shouldering  a  considerable amount of administrative work. Furthermore women  were used as spokespersons  to  win  the  support  of  other  sections.  In  Trinidad,  for example, in the early 1950s the women's auxiliary of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union was formed, and women took advantage of the fact that they were  free  to  speak  out  against  employers  on  behalf  of  the  workers  who could not. 128

After the British were driven out and local leaders took power, their true 'political complexion' became clear. Many of these leaders formed British and American alliances to further exploit their national resources of bauxite, oil,  sugar,  asphalt  and  local  labour. Thus,  neo-colonialism  brought  with  it large-scale unemployment and exploitation. None felt this betrayal as much as  the  women.  The  administrative  jobs  after  the  departure  of  the  British were filled by middle class men and a few women. Those new industries, primarily assembly and clothing, that sprung up were woefully inadequate. They were never on a scale large enough to absorb the mass of women who were the main source of labour for this kind of work. For those who were employed,  wages  were  kept  very  low  because  of  intense  competition. Significantly  though,  service  work  was  familiar  to  almost  every  black woman.  Thus  the  migration  of  working  class  women  and  men  was  an extension of the work they did as domestics in the kitchens of the colonial white  and  black  middle  class.  Thousands  arrived  in  Britain,  with  nothing but their labour to offer in the hope that they would be able to help their families left behind. They brought, however, the tradition of 'rebellion and resistance'. For most women it was their first experience of wage labour in a  modern  industrial  economy,  and  it  turned  out  to  be  a  bitter  one.  Dirty, boring,  low  pay,  low  status  jobs  was  their  common  experience.  They

received an average wage of about £6 per week which was used to maintain themselves  (and  the  children  with  them)  and  also  their  children  and relatives in the Caribbean. An estimated 98 per cent of children of Jamaican women  were  left  behind  when  they  came  to  England.  During  1961-3 approximately  £22  million  was  sent  back  to  Jamaica.  By  1965,  a  survey taken in Nottingham showed that 85 per cent of West Indian women were sending money back home.

## The 'second generation'

Young black women upheld the tradition of resistance and rebellion of their colonial  forebears.  During  the  late  1960s  hundreds  of  young  women participated  in  the  Black  Power  organisations  in  Britain.  This  rebellion burst forth irrevocably. It was characterised by open confrontation with the police, against school authorities and employers, and also within their own families, all of whom were unable to restrain them. The bitterness of a sense of defeat, a common experience, rankled giving rise to their boldness.

Inevitably, within the black community, violent clashes between mothers and daughters occurred as the push for independence pointed up the conflict between the conservatism of parents and the aspirations of their children. Consequently, hundreds of young black women were accommodated in hostels provided by the state. Sociologists, psychologists, the  police  and  community  relations  workers  were  quick  to  blame  black mothers  for  'not  caring'  enough.  This  was  a  superficial  and  unwarranted attack  for  it  was  a  denial  of  the  essential  fact  that  the  black  mother  'has always had to carry the burden of the black family' from slavery, through colonialism and the racism and sexism inherent in wage slavery in Britain.

However, what distinguishes this rebellion of young black women from their mothers is the fact that they know what is available now in Britain and want it 'without having to be wage slaves'. They demand better jobs and in general a better deal.

The question at issue is not simply concern over young people refusing to  do  the  work  their  parents  were  forced  to  do.  Rather  they  oppose  the alternative activity practised by the youth because it makes them vulnerable to the police. However, what parents failed to see was that the refusal to do traditional immigrant jobs meant that there was less competition for the jobs they were doing and, therefore, they had the power to demand a better wage and  negotiate  better  working  conditions.  To  undermine  this  situation,  the

ever vigilant hospitals began recruiting cheap labour from southern Europe and the Philippines. The weakness of young black women stems from the fact that they lack a regular wage and the discipline that goes with getting one. To compound their problems the fact that many of these women had young children meant they suffered also from the powerlessness of being a housewife.  Not  surprisingly,  many  became  desperate,  and,  it  was  argued, occasionally getting involved in mugging and shoplifting - manifestations of their powerlessness.

The transition from receiving no wage at all in the West Indies (or at best a woefully inadequate and irregular one) to receiving a regular wage under the discipline of a modern industrial economy in the metropolis had given to older West Indian women 'an access to power previously denied to them'.

And although by 1975 the West Indian community was still relatively new,  about  a  generation  old,  the  black  women  on  the  National  Union  of Public Employees negotiating team had shown they were ready to have a say in exercising that power.

## Health workers after the strike

In the remaining years of the 1970s the 'power and significance' of black women since their arrival  some  30  years  before  had  grown.  By  the  early 1980s,  their  circumstances  had  changed  dramatically,  for  the  worse,  of course. Norman  Fowler, Secretary of State for the Social Services announced  the  government's  proposals  that  ancillary  work  in  the  NHS should  be  taken  over  by  private  companies.  This  directly  affected  an estimated  70,000  black  workers  (mainly  women)  'a  third  of  the  total workforce'  in  catering,  portering,  washing  up,  cleaning  jobs  and  laundry jobs. 129 Doing the 'unwanted' jobs was in itself no guarantee that these jobs were  safe.  In  fact,  the  threat  to  them  had  come.  Black  women  had  had enough. It was time to act.

For nine months these women were on strike. They picketed and voiced their  opinions forcefully. Their tenacious struggle won them support from thousands  of  workers,  black  and  white.  Some  powerful  unions  showed concern and even the TUC gave its backing. But what at one point seemed like certain victory ended in defeat.

Three months after the strike, some black women ancillary workers at Dulwich and St Giles hospitals spoke out. At Dulwich 60 out of 774 NUPE

members  were  black  women  and  at  St  Giles  hospital  half  the  workforce were black women. During the 33-week dispute they demanded a 12 per cent wage rise, against wages assessed at half the 'average wage' and below the  'poverty  line'.  Their  struggle  was  crucial  since  in  many  cases  black women  were the only wage-earners in their families. One worker complained bitterly. 'How can someone live on £45/47 a week. Rent is £30 and you have three children to look after, its disgusting.' 130

This  situation  was  particularly  trying  for  those  one-parent  families which relied on a take-home pay of £72 after working a six-day week. The situation  was  so  deplorable  that  when  the  strike  happened  these  women were optimistic. They all believed that they would win the 12 per cent pay rise. 131 In this belief, they stayed out on strike, picketed and demonstrated for months. This protracted struggle had called forth all their reserves. For many of them,  it  was  the  first  time  they  had  ever  been  involved  in  such action. Indeed, it was the first time they had directly confronted the public with their plight or taken action with their fellow workers, black and white. They  were  positive,  readily  taking  part  in  any  union  decision  for  action, thus dispelling the myth of the passive black woman.

With  solidarity  among  health  workers  and  widespread  support  as  the strike  raged  on,  it  was  not  surprising  that  these  ancillary  workers  showed optimism. Indeed it seemed impossible that they would lose. The workforce was united, morale was high, public opinion and moral authority were on their side. As the strike gathered momentum, more nurses joined the strike. Of crucial importance was the militant support of sections of workers with national stoppages by, among others, miners and print workers. And on 22 September 1982 when over 120,000 workers marched through London, the interests  of  the  nurses  and  ancillary  workers  appeared  to  be  the  same. Solidarity  was  evident.  The Financial  Times commented  'NHS  unions would  resist  attempts  to  split  nurses  from  other  health  workers.'  But,  in spite  of  this  massive  following,  all  was  not  as  well  as  it  seemed.  By November,  the  Royal  College  of  Nursing  had  accepted  the  government's two-year settlement and agreed to call off the dispute. The result was 7.5 per cent for the nurses, 6 per cent for ancillary workers with 4 per cent in 1984. The TUC which had assumed the leadership of the strike then gave in.  For  the  hopeful  black  women,  it  was  all  over.  Once  again,  in  their representation  of  black  workers,  the  unions  took  a  tangential  course, revealing  their  true  intentions  and  serious  limitations.  Confederation  of

Health  Service  Employees,  aware  of  its  members'  mood,  offered  militant gestures (role playing) by refusing to accept the deal. Needless to say, the ancillary workers were furious. The moral authority and public support at the height of the strike was allowed to be dissipated by the leadership. For historic reasons there were devious elements at work behind the facade of solidarity between the ancillary workers and nurses. The ancillary workers felt betrayed by the TUC and the nurses. 132

In  the  aftermath,  the  ancillary  workers  showed  their  anger  over  the TUC's and the union's handling of the dispute. In short, they were disgusted with the way they were sold out.

The defeat was measured in terms of a 'meagre increase'. Moreover, the employers  demanded  their  pound  of  flesh.  The  ancillary  workers  were unanimous that they had to work harder when they returned to work after the strike. As one worker put it, 'The two of you have to do three people's work.' 133 The philosophical comments, 'we'll just have to cope with it' and 'you  just  have  to  carry  on',  acknowledged  the  fact  that  the  combined pressure  of  the  NHS  hierarchy,  the  government  and  the  anything-for-aneasy-life unions,  had  had  the  desired  effect  of  bludgeoning  (at  least temporarily)  the  ancillary  workers  into  acceptance  of  an  inadequate  pay offer  and  to  bearing  the  brunt  of  the  NHS.  The  exploitation  of  black Caribbean women  engendered and reflected a rising militancy and solidarity  with  other  sections  of  Britain's  black  workforce,  caught  in struggles in the motor and textile industries.

## The struggle at Ford's in the early 1980s

In  Ford's  assembly  plants,  a  major  area  of  industrial  production  in  the British economy, both Asian and West Indian workers came together as an act  of  solidarity  in  the  shopfloor  struggle.  Ford  workers  have  earned  a reputation for militancy. In 1981, there were unprecedented uprisings in the streets  of  Britain's  inner  cities  as  black  and  white  youths  rebelled  against their oppressors. Given their militancy, Ford workers were able to channel into their industry, the momentum of the uprisings in the streets of Brixton, Southall and Moss Side during the spring and summer of 1981. Indeed three Ford  plant  locations  had  connections  with  the  troubled  areas:  Halewood with  Toxteth,  the  Langley  truck  plant  with  Southall  (where  many  Asian

workers  live)  and  the  Dagenham  plant  whose  many  workers  came  from Brixton and other London areas affected by the summer revolt.

The uprisings were directly related to these workers. In this unprecedented action, 'there were Ford workers who played their part'.

Following  the  uprisings  the  question  of  pay  once  again  came  into contention.  Nationally,  workers  at  British  Leyland,  in  the  coal  mines  and public  sector,  were  opposed  to  the  government.  Ford  workers  took  the initiative. They demanded a £20 pay increase, a 35-hour working week and better  pensions. 134 The  central  figure  in  drawing  up  this  claim  was  the union's  chief  negotiator  Ron  Todd,  then  the  National  Organiser  of  the Transport and General Workers' Union. By the time the first meeting with Ford  management  was  held  (on  30  October  1981)  workers  at  British Leyland had struck over the government's pay ceiling. Anticipating a low offer  from Ford's, it seemed likely that Ford workers would join Leyland workers on strike. But when the offer of a 4.5 per cent bonus to be paid only when each factory  achieved  'satisfactory'  efficiency  was  announced,  Ron Todd went on television and condemned the idea that Ford workers might join Leyland workers on strike. This, however, was not the end of the story. Negotiations  were  still  in  progress.  By  December  the  company  yielded some ground, offering a miserable 7.4 per cent together with the introduction of a 39-hour week in 1983. Moreover, they continued to insist on 'efficiency measures' to be monitored by none other than a panel of fulltime union officials.

Aware  of the militant mood  of  the workers, Todd  rejected this proposition. Again  he  appeared  on  television  to  explain  to  the  public  the implications  of  the  efficiency  measures  advocated  by  Ford  management. The union membership was leafletted. Todd wrote: 'The trade unions were not  prepared  to  enter  into  an  agreement  that  would  make  Ford  workers poorer  and  worsen  their  working  conditions.'  Ultimately  the  deal  was overwhelmingly rejected in all but three of Ford's 23 factories. Strike action was scheduled to take effect after Christmas. The two crucial issues in this dispute were the inadequate pay offer, (which meant yet another real fall in living standards) and the 'efficiencies'.

No one wanted a long strike during the recession, particularly the Ford company and the government. Amidst rising unemployment, the government  was  concerned  that  the  strike  at  Ford's  might  spread  among miners and railwaymen. Political risks had to be minimised. And so for the

'first  time'  government  arbitrators  intervened  in  a  Ford  dispute.  Pressure was brought to bear on the workers through their union. Almost suddenly, the pay question, central to the strike, seemed secondary. On 30 December 1981, Todd listed the union's priorities: 'All we're saying to the company is give us a good deal on pensions, give us a good deal on shorter hours and we'll meet all your requirements on efficiency.'

Thus the sell-out began. Furthermore, Todd was quoted as saying that he  would  accept  the  pay  offer  and  efficiencies. All  he  really  wanted  was 'more radical movement' on hours of work and pensions. But, the pièce de résistance was yet to come.

On the day before the strike began, Todd called an emergency meeting of London convenors and delivered his bombshell. He told them that Ford's had improved their offer: better pensions in August, a 39-hour week in June, but no more money and no concession on efficiencies. In view of this, he added,  the  union  would  not  support  strike  action  and  there  would  be  no strike pay. There was uproar at the meeting. The union's decision to call off the strike brought anger and confusion in the factories. Although workers at Halewood walked out immediately and those at Swansea the next day, after mass meetings, it was decided by a vote of 29,000 for and 25,000 against to accept  the  offer.  Thus  the  militant  workers  at  Halewood  and  Swansea reluctantly called off their strike. The turning point in this sell-out has been attributed  to  the  defeat  of  the  Leyland  strike. The  fact  that  the  right-wing union leaders of the Engineering Union had withdrawn their support for the Leyland strike brought a lack of confidence to many moderates at Ford's. Thereafter  Todd  was  in  'full  control'. Again,  the  defeat  at  Leyland's  had organisational  repercussions  bringing  changes  in  the  motor  industry.  The most important change was that from piecework to the Measured Day Work system of payment. The effect of this change on shopfloor organisation (and on social and political life in Britain) has been dramatic.

The piecework system had established a real understanding between the shop stewards and the workers in their section, resulting in strong shopfloor organisation. Under this system it was the steward who bargained the rate for the job for each worker. Together with overtime, earnings were 'pushed up'. Of course this gain in wage levels meant less profits. The solution to this intolerable trend was a shift to the MDW system. Under this system a set  amount  of  work  was  allocated  to  each  worker.  This  left  no  scope  for greater earnings. The real significance of this shift was to reduce the power

of the local shop stewards. As it was, under the MDW, the hourly rate for each grade of the five or six grades of manual workers was negotiated by national union leaders who it seemed were far removed from the shopfloor realities. Indeed it had a beneficial effect to trade union officialdom in that it  was  accompanied  by  strict  disciplinary  agreements  between  union  and management.  Thus  the  shop  steward  no  longer  had  an  important  role  in wage  bargaining  under  the  MDW.  His  relationship  to  his  section  was therefore weaker and so too was shopfloor organisation. These fundamental changes  in  the  motor  industry  had  the  effect  of  reinforcing  the  MDW system at Ford's where, according to one worker, 'the workers had never been on piecework'. Consequently, wages at Ford's were the 'lowest' in the motor  industry  until  the  mid-1970s. 135 Furthermore,  their  factories  were located  in  areas  of  high  unemployment  (for  example,  Halewood  and Swansea) and significantly they employed large numbers of black, immigrant workers, a source of cheap labour. Indeed the large majority of Asian and West Indian workers occupied the lowest unskilled grades. Few black workers achieved Grade C status.

Divisions  also  existed  within  sections  on  the  assembly  lines  where  in the  'bottom  section',  the  majority  of  workers  were Asians  with  'only  the occasional white and West Indian worker'. The 'middle section' (involving slightly more skilled work) was less arduous. Here there were fewer Blacks and  more Whites.  Finally,  in  the  'top  section'  (the  repair  area)  where  the pace  of  work  is  slower  and  the  'most  overtime'  worked,  white  workers predominated. 136

In recent years, at the southern plants, the Ford method of discipline and control has met with strong working class resistance. These were 'hidden' struggles,  not  well  documented  or  publicly  known.  The  most  potent  of these, especially in the mid-70s, was the workers' refusal to tolerate low pay and intolerable working conditions. Indeed, the turnover of workers on the assembly lines was estimated at over 65 per cent as late as 1978. For most of the 1970s, lineworkers were involved in daily disputes on such issues as 'grading  and  wash  up  time;  time  to  prepare  for  work,  wash  before  meal breaks, and time to wash and change in the evening before clocking off'. 137

Simultaneously  there  was  a  general  insubordination  on  the  shopfloor. Foremen's  orders  were  disregarded,  cars  and  machinery  were,  at  times, sabotaged,  and  there  were  'slowdowns'  and  disputes.  At  the  time,  the

situation  at  Ford's  was  verging  on  an  almost  'total  disintegration  of  the workforce'. Ford's retaliated with layoffs which resulted in two big riots in August and September 1973, which were repeated in 1976.

Partly because of the recession and because of the concerted attempt by the  unions  to  assert  their  authority  on  the  shopfloor,  these  struggles  have subsided. The unions have been accused of allowing militants to be sacked and  in  1977,  for  smashing  a  major  strike  and  occupation  at  Dagenham, against  unpaid  lay-offs.  In  spite  of  the  pressures,  the  'hidden'  struggles continued mainly in the form of 'sabotage'.

## Internal union conflict

Although these struggles were (and are) kept from the full glare of publicity their  cumulative  effect  was  reflected  in  the  growing  conflict  with  the unions. For example, under MDW, the unions were largely involved in the process of discipline and control. Furthermore, there is strong pressure on convenors and senior stewards from national union leaders to ensure that 'members  carry  out  their  side  of  the  agreements  we  enter  into  with  the Company'. The message to the rank and file was accept Ford's discipline. This does not reflect the interest of 'lineworkers' and thus makes redundant the  'representative'  role  of  convenors  and  senior  stewards.  Moreover, although more than half of the workforce in Ford's southern plants were by mid-1982 Asian or West Indian, there were only four West Indian stewards and one Asian out of a total workforce of 138 senior stewards. The Asian steward was a token gesture.

Nevertheless the force for change from below was insistent. As a result of  these  struggles  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the  number  of Asian  and West  Indian  stewards  representing  lineworkers.  Given  the  nature  of  their tasks and their position in the union hierarchy, their voice will no doubt be heard at the workplace. But their effect is still ultimately largely dependent on their union's structure. For many this was clearly unacceptable.

## The textile industry

Into the 1980s  with  rising  unemployment  among  black  youth,  black workers  were  still  largely  employed  to  do  'shit  work'.  Inevitably,  their struggles were many. Of particular interest was their struggle in the textile industry  where  thousands  of Asians  were  employed:  'dirty  jobs'  and  bad

working conditions prevailed. In the wool textile industry in Bradford, they provided cheap labour. According to Yusuf Ahmat, the racist attitudes of the union ensured a divided and malleable workforce as a whole. Given that the financial  structure  of  the  industry  was  changing  throughout  the  period, many small firms were driven out of business, unable or unwilling (because of profitable alternatives) to keep up with the pace of technological change required of them to survive the competition. A lot of smaller firms either closed or amalgamated  with the larger firms. In addition chemical multinationals such as Imperial Chemical  Industries and Courtaulds, wishing to exploit the potential of mixing wool with synthetic fibres, moved into the industry.

In spite of these strategies, few jobs were saved. Jobs were clearly being lost as a result of changes in the level of productivity in a situation of falling consumer  demand.  In  just  two  years  between  1970  and  1972  output  per head  rose  by  50  per  cent.  This  figure  is  no  doubt  much  higher  now  as  a result of more recent changes in technology. 138 With government assistance, firms have been encouraged to implement programmes of drastic closures and  amalgamations  resulting  in  massive  redundancies.  Rationalisation, amalgamation  and  new  technology  have  not  provided  any  answer  to  the employment  problems  of  the  wool  textile  industry.  It  was  argued  that 'Demands for increased productivity are being made in those firms where no  new  technology  has  been  introduced,  meaning  a  constant  pressure  on those who are still at work.'

In effect, technology meant more work but fewer workers. The massive decline  in  jobs  throughout  the  late  1970s  increased  dramatically  into  the 1980s. The introduction of new machinery and techniques have resulted not only  in  speeding  up  processes.  Those  who  continue  to  be  employed  are under  the  pressure  of  increased  workloads,  implemented  by  and  largely because of the threat of redundancies and lack of effective union resistance. The implications of new technology were essentially permanent job losses, brought  about  by  increased  productivity.  The  apparent  ease  with  which redundancies  have  been  accepted  is  symptomatic  of  the  nature  of  worker organisation in the factory. The unions involved were the textiles section of the  General  Municipal Workers'  Union  and  what  used  to  be  the  National Union  of  Dyers  and  Bleachers,  recently  absorbed  by  the  Transport  and General Workers' Union. Significant proportions of the workforce, however, are non-unionised. It was argued that traditionally, these 'bosses'

unions' were more interested in representing particular craft sections to the detriment  of  all  others.  The  bureaucratic  structure  of  these  unions  was therefore in conflict with the participation of any workers - black or white. Their  leadership  has  tended  to  be  self-perpetuating  oligarchies  who  have not exactly been known to represent the interests of their membership, and have  often  worked  against  their  interest,  particularly  that  of  the  Asian members. 139

The experience of the Asian workers involved in the unions has been an unfortunate story of betrayal and sell-outs. Asian workers have repeatedly had to defend themselves at work, without help from either the unions or their white  co-workers.  In  spite  of all this, the number  of  disputes (unofficial)  that  involved Asian  workers  had  increased  by  the  turn  of  the 1980s.

Overall,  as  the  confidence  of  black  workers  grew,  through  struggles both  at  the  workplace  and  in  the  black  communities,  many  of  them  were (and  are) moving  towards  independent  organisation.  Their  experience points logically in this direction.

## Black workers and the trade unions

## Colonial background: the emergence of trade unionism

Colonial Office policy decisions and Colonial Office advice were often the strongest  of  the  many  pressures  to  which  a  colonial  government  was subjected. Labour developments in colonial territories was a vital consideration  for  metropolitan  investment.  Thus,  a  knowledge  of  the  raw material and labour resources inevitably meant an exchange of information and ideas between the governors of the dependent territories and the British government. This was most important in formulating policy and in reaching agreement on changes in the territories themselves.

In general, British colonial administration was, in certain respects, one of flexibility and diversity, reflecting the differences in social and economic conditions in the various colonies, the different views and personalities of the  Governors  and  the  different  historical  developments  and  stages  of constitutional  advance.  However,  there  was  some  unity  on  policy  matters concerning  human  rights  and  social  policy,  a  unity  co-ordinated  by  the Colonial Office.

Labour  policies  then,  and  especially  the  policies  concerning  trade unions  and  industrial  relations,  must  also  be  viewed  in  relation  to  the Colonial Office.

Before the First World War, the Colonial Office had no general labour policy.  In  fact,  it  played  no  role  in  formulating  or  implementing  general policy  on  any  question  during  that  period.  In  effect,  this  meant  that considerable powers on these matters were invested in the Governor and his advisers.

Despite  mounting  agitation  for  constitutional  advance  to  full  suffrage and local representation in the colonies, the colonial legislatures remained unrepresentative, did not reflect a full range of opinion and often tended to be reactionary and against social progress.

It was only with the loss of some of their power to political parties and elected bodies that the traditional local leaders had to change their attitude towards the activities  of  trade  unions.  For  example,  the  owners  of  mines, plantation managers and settlers who fiercely protected what they considered to be their right to a steady supply of cheap labour were strong supporters of traditional authority and firmly opposed to any manifestation of  trade  unionism.  When  the  First  World  War  broke  out  the  scarcity  of labour  and  the  need  to  improve  and  control  the  system  of  recruitment, contracting and discipline of labour were already emergent issues. The war itself stimulated interest in the colonies and brought new responsibilities to the  Colonial  Office.  More  particularly,  it  focused  attention  on  labour problems. After the war, the International Labour Organisation was created (in  1919)  and  labour  standards  in  the  non-self-governing  territories  for which ILO member states were responsible began to receive increasingly more attention. 140

## Emergence of Colonial Office labour policy

In  the  1920s  labour  problems  in  the  colonies  received  growing  attention from  the  Colonial  Office.  Early  in  the  decade,  labour  conditions  in  East Africa  were  discussed  in  Parliament,  petitions  were  presented  to  the government  and  several  despatches  were  sent  to  the  Governor  of  Kenya. During  these  years,  there  was  a  rapid  growth  of  trade  unions  in  India, accompanied by an increase in the number of strikes. This rising militancy was largely attributable  to  the  activity  of  Indian  and  British  Communists,

who saw the development of Indian trade unions as an opportunity for the promotion of revolutionary political doctrines.

As a result of monitoring events in India and other parts of the Colonial Empire, the Labour Party, on its return to power in 1924 and 1929, quite naturally devoted more attention to labour matters than previous governments, concentrating on changes in policy. Consequently, when the East African Royal Commission was appointed to visit Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland,  Kenya,  Uganda  and  Tanganyika  in  July  1924,  it  was  asked, among other things, to report on: (i) the action necessary to ameliorate the social  conditions  of  the  natives  of  East Africa,  including  improvement  of health and economic development; and (ii) the economic relations between natives and non-natives with special reference to labour contracts, care of labourers, certificates of identification and the employment of women and children.

The  Commission's  report,  however,  concentrated  on  constitutional matters, rather than on labour and social matters. Subsequently, communication between the British government and colonial administrations grew in importance.

The  Labour  government  that  took  office  in  1929  attached  much importance to colonial problems. The Labour Party and the TUC favoured the formation of trade unions in the colonies. In 1930 the Colonial Office Labour Committee was established to deal, over a projected 12-year period, with the basic formulation of Colonial Office labour policy, the drafting of model  laws  and  the  effects  on  dependencies  of  some  of  the  international labour conventions of the period.

Colonial  Office  policy  was  designed  to  direct  the  colonised  peoples away  from economic  and political discontent and to provide some opportunities for 'progress'. Apparently, it was easier for a government to deal with an organised body such as a trade union than with a number of 'irresponsible'  individuals.  In  this  context,  the  success  of  co-operative societies augured well for the future success of trade unions. This, then, was a clear statement of policy by the new Labour government.

The Colonial Office was now prepared to begin formulating a policy for the  improvement  of  labour  and  social  conditions.  While  this  move  was recognised, there remained considerable doubts about the readiness of the colonial  governments  to  accept  such  institutional  developments  as  trade unions. However, the Secretary of State was in little doubt as to the need for

more  positive  action.  Consequently,  the  Colonial  Office  conference  was followed by a circular despatch in September  1930  to all colonial governments  advocating the passage of trade union legislation. The despatch  portrayed  the  formation  of  trade  unions  as  being  a  natural  and legitimate  development  in  the  colonial  territories  as  social  and  industrial progress  took  place.  It  also  suggested  that  where  no  unions  had  yet  been established simple legislation should be passed incorporating the principles of  the  1871  British  Trade  Union Act  which  exempted  trade  unions  from liability to prosecution and to civil action on the grounds that their objects or activities were in restraint of trade. Further, the despatch recommended the compulsory registration of all trade unions. The justification for this was that the idea of combining together for economic purposes (because of its novelty in most  territories) meant  that 'sympathetic supervision and guidance' would be necessary.

As far as Colonial Office policy was concerned, the despatch reflected and formalised a change that had been pending since the end of the First World War. On the other hand, to the majority of colonial governments, the effect of the despatch was minimal. It met with much resistance and apathy in the various territories, and little or no action was taken for more than ten years in certain cases.

After  a  further  despatch  two  years  later  in  which  model  workmen's compensation provisions were circulated to African colonies, again little or no  immediate  action  resulted.  In  effect,  the  financial  difficulties  of  the decade  meant  that  labour  conditions  in  the  colonies  were  neglected. Meanwhile the deterioriating conditions increased working-class discontent and  brought  mounting  tension.  In  1935,  a  strike  in  the  copper  mines  of Northern  Rhodesia  ended  in  death  for  some  workers  when  the  police opened fire. About this time, Malcolm MacDonald was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies. And, in November 1935, a despatch was sent to all colonial governments, asking for a revision of their arrangements for the supervision  of  employment  conditions.  The  despatch,  having  set  out  the duties  of  a  Labour  Department  emphasised  the  function  of  enforcing legislation, thus forestalling complaints, rather than taking action on them as they happened. 141

The impact of colonial industrial unrest was to lead to the MacDonald despatch  of  1935.  And  it  was  the  colonial  industrial  unrest  during  1937 (particularly in the Caribbean) which led to some concentration on labour

matters in Parliamentary colonial debates in which the above factors were cited. Following these developments the Colonial Secretary was encouraged to  send  yet  another  circular  despatch  in August  1937.  Urgent  action  was stressed  and  colonial  governments  were  reminded  of  the  terms  of  the MacDonald  despatch  of  1935.  While  the  despatch  reiterated  that  the establishment  of  labour  departments  should  be  the  'ultimate  aim'  in  the larger  dependencies,  it  again  left  a  wide  margin  of  discretion  to  each government. In effect, this 1937 despatch had a greater impact than earlier Colonial  Office  communications.  It  evoked  a  more  favourable  response from the colonial governments because of a growing realisation (forcefully brought about by events) that labour unrest would continue if the changes advocated by the Colonial Office were not followed. 142

## Black workers and the trade unions: the British experience

A  black  worker  when  asked  whether  he  had  taken  his  case  of  alleged discrimination  to  the  union,  said,  'The  union?  Man,  that's  for  white people.' 143 The  vast  majority  of  black  workers  in  Britain  will  agree  with this.

On  the  other  hand,  the  unions,  essentially  defensive  working  class organisations, used their full official  powers to defend themselves against criticism  from  black  workers.  But  having  put  in  perspective  the  general struggle  of  black  workers,  how  do  the  essentially  white  unions  and  black workers  see  each  other?  There  are  no  straightforward  answers  in  the complex interrelationship between the various groups of black workers and their  unions.  Pakistani  workers,  for  example,  posed  special  difficulties. Questions  as  to  what  their  attitude  to  unions  were  and  their  reasons  for joining  or  not  joining  were  put  to  187  Pakistanis,  the  majority  of  whom were employed in the textile industry, with a smaller number in transport and engineering.

The  result  of  the  interviews  taken  during  a  survey  conducted  by  the Runnymede  Trust (1970) showed  that Pakistanis joined unions less frequently  than  their  English  counterparts.  Of  the  187  employed  only  27 were  union  members.  It  is  necessary  to  look  behind  these  figures  at  the work situation of those involved and their behaviour over a long period.

When asked what they thought of British trade unions, only 14 per cent of the Pakistanis were convinced enough to join. By comparison, the overall figure for all immigrants was 6.2 per cent, while that for English workers was  46  per  cent.  Furthermore,  just  over  half  the  Pakistani  workers  (96) thought  that  trade  unions  were  helpful.  The  other  91  thought  the  unions were not. Provoked into further response, 30 out of the 96 explained firstly that  the  unions  were  helpful  'but  we  don't  take  any  interest  -  we  should make them realise our presence - we do not co-operate'. Secondly, 40 out of  the  96  were  of  the  view  that  'We  can  get  experience  from  them  and secure better working conditions, religious holidays, etc'; and thirdly, out of the  91  that  took  a  negative  view  of  the  unions,  23  said  'They  don't  do anything to help us', while 11 felt that 'They don't want to include us - they are prejudiced and seek to exploit us.'

In  sum then, a large number believed in the power of the unions. For example,  in  their  ability  to  get  things  done.  They  were  hopeful  that  the unions would get things done for them. Indeed, many of these immigrants blamed themselves for the lack of success of their unions. But the statement also showed that some Pakistanis held out little hope of being helped by the unions. They spoke of 'prejudice and discrimination'. 144

Did  these  workers  expect  special  treatment  from  the  unions?  When asked to explain in what ways they thought a trade union or shop steward could  be  helpful  to  them,  76  out  of  the  187  pointed  to  their  needs  as industrial  workers,  while  only  12  referred  to  cultural  needs,  for  example, religious holidays, prayer time, etc.

Moreover,  out  of  the  76  the  majority  called  for  direct  representation through officials who happen to be immigrants but elected in the 'normal way' rather than through special liaison officials or 'go-betweens'. Indeed, the Pakistanis felt they had the same needs as their English colleagues. Of the  36  who  could  think  of  no  way  in  which  the  union  could  help,  one thought  that  'they  are  English  trade  unions  …  they  must  represent  us instead of sowing seeds of disunity among us'. Another immigrant referred to  the  unions  as  'frauds'  which  only  'confuse  us'.  'They  are  English',  he added,  'and  unless  they  give  us  representation  it  is  useless  to  expect anything sensible from them.' The alienation reflected here was abundantly clear. Significantly the majority of migrants in this group spoke little or no English. Equally important was the fact that generally, speaking ability in

English  appeared  to  have  had  little  connection  with  whether  immigrants thought of unions as helpful or not.

Finally  the  question  of  the  role  of  these  Pakistani  workers  in  union affairs  was  posed.  Like  the  majority  of  trade  unionists  in  Britain,  after paying the union subscriptions, the Pakistani worker played little part in the union. Of the 27 union members, 22 had never been to a union meeting, and 'only 5 attended some time over the period of the previous year'.

At times what the Pakistani worker believed to be the union's obligation remained unfulfilled. In one case involving an accident, a Pakistani worker left  the  union  when  the  union  failed  to  get  him  compensation.  Wrongful dismissal  was  another  bone  of  contention  between  the  immigrant  worker and  the  union's  desire  or  ability  to  help.  The  frequent  occurrence  of accidents and wrongful dismissals had a cumulative effect of disenchantment. However, one reason advanced for the low union membership among Pakistani workers in the textile  industry  was  the  fact that  only  about  40  per  cent  knew  that  a  union  existed!  In  the  case  of  the engineering industry, the figure was 50 per cent. Matters were helped little by the fact that 'weak' unions saw their role as keeping things as they were, maintaining the customary wage differentials and not going out of their way to  recruit  new  members.  This  attitude  on  the  part  of  the  union  led  to inevitable misunderstandings.

Another  factor  which  determined  whether  men  and  women  joined  a union was the union's 'image'. This was crucial to the alienated Pakistanis who said they would be unwilling to join a union which they perceived to be 'too much with management'. 145

In general, the problems of the Pakistani workers were symptomatic of the  relations  of  immigrant  workers  as  a  whole.  These  non-white  workers posed a challenge to the predominantly white trade unionists. This raised many questions. Firstly, why was the immigrant worker under-represented? The percentage between immigrants and English workers in such industries as textiles, printing, building, engineering, service industries, transport and the public service showed that white workers were more likely to be union members than  immigrants. The  evidence  also  revealed  that  the  degree  of union membership among immigrants in one particular industry follows the same pattern as that of the white workers in that industry. This meant that in a weaker  union  both  immigrant  and  English  union  members  will  be relatively few. But the fact that large numbers of immigrant workers were

concentrated in such unions (in the textile industry, for instance, which had traditionally had weak unions) the misleading impression was created that they were not really interested in the unions. A major factor in organising immigrant  workers  was  that  they  came  from  different  countries  with different backgrounds. One study showed that, on the whole, West Indian workers were more highly organised than Pakistanis. West Indians did not have  English  language  problems  which  the  Indians  and  Pakistanis  were faced with when they came to England. Indians, however, were helped by the  Indian  Workers  Association  which  was  well  organised  by  Sikhs  in Bradford.

Taken  as  a  group,  among  immigrants  as  a  whole,  in  1970,  union membership in the printing, engineering and transport industries respectively,  were:  Pakistanis  -  100%,  41%  and  89.8%;  Indians  -  100%, 44%  and  100%;  while  West  Indians  -  0%,  66.6%  and  87.5%. 146 Given these membership concentrations, why did immigrant members not play a more active  part  in  the  unions?  Clearly  they  were  under-represented  as  a group. In fact only in a few cases (before 1970) were they active members in  the  trade  unions.  One  argument  advanced  for  this  was  the  fact  that immigrants who knew little English were not in a position to become union officials.  But  why  since  there  were  many  who  spoke  and  wrote  English well, were they so under-represented?

Before  1970  there  were  only  13  immigrant  part-time  union  officials. Two of these were branch committee members in the transport sector; three were shop stewards and eight were collectors in the textile industry. They were  chiefly  concerned  with  immigrant  workers  in  the  unions,  especially where there were language problems. But 'language' problems was obviously much too limited an area of trade union involvement, especially where there was blatant discrimination in pay and working conditions and promotion.

Another question of vital importance in the relationship between black workers  and  the  trade  unions  was:  were  they  'workers'  or  'immigrants'? This question was posed particularly because union officials tended to stress the differences (cultural and otherwise) between immigrant workers and the others.  Union  officials  said  the  difficulties  were  caused  by  the  language barrier; immigrants joining and then becoming disillusioned by the lack of effectiveness of the union, immigrants' distrust of the union, and frequent

job  changes,  lack  of  understanding  of  the  purpose  of  unions,  apathy  and objections to political levy.

These 'causes', as the union officials saw them, were flawed. In fact, a number of  these  reasons  were  based  on  misinformation  as  in  the  case  of 'frequent  job  changes,  lack  of  understanding  of  the  purpose  of  unions, apathy and objections to a political levy'. On this point, there was 'little to show  that  immigrants  do  in  fact  change  jobs  frequently'.  Further,  taken together, the reasons advanced by the officials heaped all the blame on the immigrants themselves. Were the unions themselves that blameless?

One could not escape the all-pervasive prejudices which understandably existed.  Indeed  there  was  a  widespread  belief  (shared  by  a  few  union officials)  that  Pakistani  workers  in  Bradford  -  as  other  immigrants  else where-worked long hours and enjoyed doing so. In fact, by far the largest proportion worked 'no overtime at all'. Many of the Pakistanis interviewed said  that  they  preferred  not  to  work  long  hours,  for  health  reasons. Thus, immigrant  union  membership  became  confused  with  the  question  of overtime and long hours. Indeed, these matters reflected the union's failure to improve adequately its members' standard of living.

In  explaining  low  membership  and  under-representation,  it  might  also be  easily  misconstrued  that  because  it  was  assumed  that  the  immigrants were 'already earning good money' they did not feel union membership was necessary.  In  fact,  the  average  weekly  wage  of  those  interviewed  was £16.16 . By comparison the national average around that time (1967) was s £20.12 . for men over 21. 147 s Moreover, there was little evidence to support the generally held view that the longer time a job was held the more likely a man was to become unionised.

More importantly,  when  asked  how  they  were  recruited,  it  was  found that immigrant workers had usually been asked to join by their friends, and not by the shop steward. It is clear then that the question of communication played some part in whether immigrants held a favourable opinion of the unions or not.

According to the figures, however, it must not be assumed that simply improving communication between immigrants and unions would solve all problems.  The  rhetoric  of  trade  union  officialdom  tended  to  project  this view. In fact, the Bradford study showed that immigrants faced much the same difficulties as English workers when at work.

There  is also the question of the union's failure to act on the immigrant's  behalf.  The  implication  of  this  failure  was  that  immigrant workers on the shopfloor were likely to act collectively themselves. In one case, a group of Pakistani workers involved in a dispute with management over bonus payments sent one of their number to put forward as spokesman their problem to the management. When the 'spokesman' was sacked, the group of 25 walked out of the shift in protest against what they considered an act of victimisation. They made a powerful statement as to their lack of trade union involvement and under-representation and untended grievances. Indeed, when  they walked  out in protest at the dismissal of their representative they were, of course, using trade union methods but this was outside the accepted union framework.

The conclusions  of  the  study  carried  out  in  Bradford  revealed  clearly that  trade  union  officials  knew  and  cared  very  little  about  immigrant workers. In particular, they often stressed, sometimes unwittingly, cultural differences  rather  than  the  similarities  in  the  work  situation  of  all  trade union members. For example, some officials said that few immigrants join unions, while others expressed their belief that immigrants join unions as readily as English workers. Significantly, few of those questioned appeared to  distinguish  between  the  various  nationalities  of  immigrants;  Pakistanis, Indians and West Indians tended to get 'lumped together'.

Moreover, although some immigrants mentioned cultural and linguistic differences, on the whole they saw themselves as workers who wanted to improve  their  industrial  position  like  other  workers.  Further,  the  study showed  that  some  unions  made  little  effort  to  encourage  immigrants  to join. 148 Thus,  even  when they joined, they rarely played an active part in their union. Emphasis was placed in the disillusionment of many immigrants, and showed how discrimination (real or apparent) by a trade union could give rise to mistrust. Finally in the extreme circumstances (a not  unusual  situation  for  immigrants)  unilateral  action  by  immigrants themselves  acting  outside  the  trade  union  framework  was  always  a  real possibility.

On  the  question  of  economic  status  and  occupations,  despite  high economic activity rates, recent studies and surveys showed that unemployment  among  young  West  Indians,  in  particular,  was  a  problem causing mounting concern. The 1971 Census showed that 16.2 per cent of persons aged 16-20 born in the West Indies were unemployed, compared

with  8.1  per  cent  of  all  youth  aged  16-20  in  Great  Britain,  and  other researchers had suggested even higher proportions. 149  Alienation from the culture of the host society and low educational attainment were only two of the factors  creating  this  problem.  Additional  factors  such  as  unequal opportunity and discrimination on the basis of colour had been highlighted by  two  PEP  reports, The Extent  of  Racial  Discrimination (October  1974) and Racial Disadvantage in Employment (June 1974). The findings of the latter  report  supplement  and  reinforce  the  findings  of  the  former  which states that a substantial level of discrimination was found even at the level of recruitment for unskilled manual jobs (46 per cent met discrimination): and that 30 per cent of Indian and West Indian applicants were discriminated  against  at  the  earliest  stage  of  recruitment  (the  written application stage) in a broad range of white collar jobs. 150 The authors of this  carefully  designed  research  stated  that  the  findings  in  all  the  tests strengthened  the  conclusion  that  it was  prejudice  over  colour  which underlay most of the discrimination shown.

There was one area in which it was possible to reach reasonably firm conclusions,  and  that  was  in  the  net  cost  to  the  economy  of  the  social services  absorbed  by  immigrants.  Here  it  seemed  clear  that  immigrant workers,  a  predominantly  working  age  population  with  (originally)  a relatively  low  number  of  children  and  dependants  and  a  relatively  small population of retirement age, made a substantial once-for-all net contribution to the economy. A careful study by members of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, concluded that taking 'all social security expenditure and public expenditure on health and welfare benefits together, the average immigrant received about 80 per cent as much as the average member of the indigenous population in 1961 and the figure seems likely to be 85 to 90 per cent by 1981'. 151

## Trade union membership and participation

By  1975,  apart  from  the  'Bradford  Study',  there  was  unfortunately  very little  research  material  available  on  the  extent  of  trade  union  membership among black and other migrant workers. What there was suggests firstly, that  overall  trade  union  membership  was  proportionately  lower  for  black migrant workers, and secondly, that in well-organised factories and industries  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  level  of  trade  union membership of the two groups.

The major reason for  lower  proportionate  membership  was  that  black and immigrant workers were over-represented both in industries and service where trade union organisation was low (for example, catering and hotels, building  and  textiles)  and  in  plants,  factories  and  workshops  employing relatively few workers in which it was in general more difficult to organise and  maintain  membership.  Other  factors  cited,  though  relatively  less important,  included  the  failure  of  the  movement  to  develop  recruitment techniques which take account of both language and cultural differences.

With  regard  to  participation,  the  evidence  by  1975  was  even  scantier and measuring criteria was difficult to establish. There were forces at work which made it difficult for Blacks to play their full part in the movement. These included such factors as language differences, shift working, ethnic work groups, and lack of trade union experience. To involve rank and file workers was a general problem, though not one peculiar to black workers. But where there were special difficulties for these workers, there was the need for flexibility in approach regarding, for example, communication and time and place of meetings. It was clear, however, that black workers were under-represented  at  every  level  of  trade  union  activity.  This  was  so whether  it  be  full-time  official  level,  attendance  as  delegates  to  policymaking bodies, at branch or at shop floor level.

One  kind  of  solution,  so  far  as  appointed  officials  were  concerned, might be the deliberate adoption of targets for the appointment of certain numbers of people, from ethnic minority groups, particularly in the unions with a substantial black membership (actual or potential). According to the Runnymede Trust, a different  kind  of  solution  would  be  to  seek,  through traditional trade union democracy in the labour movement, the removal of all  barriers to participation, so that immigrant workers were offered every assistance and encouragement in their trade union activity. 152

One  barrier  to  participation  exists  in  some  relatively  undemocratic union  structures.  In  spite  of  a  very  healthy  movement  in  recent  years towards  greater  shopfloor  participation  and  the  development  of  much improved shop steward representation (both in quality and quantity), it was no surprise that this development had been uneven and that there were still large areas of 'backwaters'. In the two most bitter disputes involving black workers (up to that time) the question of democratic rights and representation  in  the  union  was  a  major  issue,  as  for  example,  in  the Mansfield Hosiery Mills dispute and at Imperial Typewriters. Where union

rules  and  practices  effectively  discriminated  against  newcomers  (as  at Imperial  Typewriters,  or  against  the  unskilled,  as  at  Mansfield  Hosiery Mills) they had a particularly powerful impact on immigrant workers.

## Special services for black immigrant workers

There has often been resistance to the development of special services for particular groups of trade union members; for example, women, youths and most  recently,  migrant  workers.  It  has  been  argued  that  such  practices perpetuate  divisions,  draw  attention  to  differences  and  therefore  hinder unity. On the other hand, where workers had specific problems and needs, it was the job of the movement to develop ways and means of dealing with them. It was this latter argument which gained ground in recent years, and which  had  in  the  case  of  both  women  and  young  workers  been  largely accepted.

The creation of conditions for greater unity was emphasised. Indeed, it was recognised that language and cultural differences could create misunderstandings; it was argued, for example, that some migrant workers could  not  play  a  full  part  in  the  movement  because  their  command  of English was rudimentary or nonexistent. Lack of knowledge of trade union procedures and the context of collective agreements also led to misunderstandings  and  frustration.  Some  groups  with  strong  religious  or cultural traditions, said the Runnymede Trust, may want some changes in holiday arrangements, or canteen diets, to represent what could be seen as a normal union function. To cope with the difficulties, it was further argued that provision should be made to make available a much needed trade union service to a group of members such as will assist greater unity of action. 153

While language remained a problem, in one area at least, a trade union was  directly  involved  in  language  training  for  its  members.  The  Southall District Committee of the TGWU provided specialist language classes for Asian union members. But perhaps the most interesting development, at the time,  was  the  formation  of  the  TGWU  International  Workers'  Branch. Indeed, developments within the TGWU's London region was regarded as constituting  the  most  creative  attempt  to  overcome  some  of  the  many problems outlined above. For example, hotel and catering workers of many nationalities were organised into a Catering Workers Branch, which, at the time, was open to all workers in the industry and the area. Unfortunately,

even while these encouraging developments were taking place, discrimination against black workers was being widely practised.

## The general problem

Two  factors  were  present  in  the  Imperial  Typewriters  case  which  have characterised all the  disputes  mentioned  above:  the  tremendous  unity  and solidarity  of  the  black  workers  during  long  and  bitter  struggles  and  the failure to build unity of all workers, black and white, around the strikers' demands.

It might be tempting, despite isolated though  important disputes involving black workers during the 1960s such as Courtaulds, Woolf's and Birmid  Qualcast,  to  conclude  that  it  was  the  Mansfield  Hosiery  Mills dispute  which  in  1972  really  convinced  black  workers  of  the  value  of militant  action.  But  other  factors  were  almost  certainly  involved.  Firstly, there was the general increase in trade union militancy which, as we have seen, had involved many black workers; secondly, black workers themselves had settled in, became accustomed to the stresses and strains of industrial life, and reconciled themselves to the idea that instead of going back home to start a new life, they were here to stay. In this climate they had  become  a  lot  less  tolerant  of  the  injustices  of  race  discrimination.  In fact, they had begun to think of their future in Britain and they looked both for support and ways of improving their position in Britain. As workers they looked to the trade union movement for support and chose traditional trade union methods of struggle. The outstanding victory of the Asian workers at Mansfield  Hosiery,  in  the  teeth  of  opposition  from  their  union,  employer and white workmates, gave force and confidence to a developing movement.

Apart from the rise in militancy among black workers, there had been the continuing discrimination against black people in Britain; discrimination  which  rests  on  a  strong  current  of  racialist  ideas.  In  this environment  it  is  perhaps  not  surprising  that  disputes  such  as  those mentioned above should lead to the bitterness and frustration exemplified in the events at Imperial Typewriters.

The union inquiry report was clear that the strength of emotional feeling on both sides created disharmony to a point where the industrial issues were submerged. Moreover, in both the Mansfield and Imperial disputes, management was able to exploit racial divisions and win support from local

trade union leaders for agreements which were against the interests of black workers (indeed all workers) and their trade unions. At Loughborough, for example, a productivity deal which had been successfully resisted for two years,  was  negotiated  during  the  strike  by  skilled  white  workers. And  at Imperial the Union Branch and the District Committee backed management's attempts to victimise the strike leaders.

The  crucial  problem  facing  the  strike  leaders,  shopfloor  and  national union leaders had been that of uniting the workforce. Strikes are difficult to win  without  solidarity;  where  workers  are  divided,  the  situation  becomes almost  impossible.  In  all  these  disputes  the  strike  leaders  and  the  factory leadership  were  at  loggerheads.  Moreover,  the  task  of  uniting  them  was dependent upon top union officials who were far removed from the black workers'  problems.  Where  divisions  were  wide  and  bedevilled  by  race prejudice this was no easy task.

While there was harmony in some workplaces, black workers' demands for greater participation in union affairs, at all levels, were generally a direct challenge  to  some  of  the  relatively  undemocratic  structures  that  existed. Given  that  the  trade  union  movement  exists  to  protect  and  advance  the interests  of  all  working  people,  it  was  argued  that  in  this  role  it  cannot tolerate discriminatory practices which were based on criteria such as race and colour. Indeed, in cases where the movement had failed to apply such basic  trade  union  principles,  a  price  had  been  paid,  not  only  by  those discriminated against, but by those who had been party to the discrimination.  While  race  prejudice  remains  widespread,  trade  union actions  to  end  discrimination  will  be  that  much  more  difficult.  This highlights  the  need  for  'race  relations'  education  within  the  trade  union movement which could play a central role in undermining blatant prejudice.

In  a  case  study  of  a  Midlands  building  site,  a  black  worker  was discriminated against; a case in which, once again, the question of colour was  significant.  Generally,  the  white  workers  did  not  mind  working  with black  workers,  who  they  thought  were  not  as  good  as  white  workers. Amidst mounting tension on the building site, a West Indian carpenter was dismissed. It was said he told the foreman to f*** off when asked to move a ladder. The West Indian denied this was the real reason for his dismissal. While  admitting  that  the  incident  may  have  occurred,  he  said  the  real problem  arose  from  the  bad  relationship  which  had  developed  between himself and the foreman. He attributed this to the foreman's willingness to

talk about the sexual behaviour of black people. He concluded that from his experience people who wanted to know about the sex lives of black people were  usually  racialist.  Consequently,  he  told  the  foreman  that  the  only conversation he wanted was strictly about work. It was after this that he had been dismissed. 154

## Race, sex discrimination and the British trade unions

One researcher found that when black workers first entered the labour force in large numbers in the early 1980s, many trade unionists were afraid that they would act as a source of cheap labour and, as competitors, force down the wages of white workers. The stoppage of labour into Britain during the past decade has meant, however, that most black migrants were receiving the  'same'  wage  for  a  job  as  would  a  white  man. 155 Moreover,  the researcher concluded: 'Where some had expected me to discover a picture drawn in black and white, my investigation of six weeks indicates a scene painted with a most varied palette. Instances of overt discrimination are to be found in the labour movement. But for the national trade unions, local branches and the colonial immigrant, the problems of communication seem to be greater.' 156

In spite of these findings, a few years later, interest in racial discrimination had grown. In December 1970 a Conference on 'The Trade Union  Movement  and  Discrimination'  was  convened  by  Ruskin  College, Oxford. The Conference grappled with two problems: 'how far is there a special problem?  and 'how  far should things be left to look after themselves?' Further, the Conference was not concerned simply with race relations in isolation, but with  the wider  issues  and  implications  of discrimination in general. While the academic institutions were conscious of the problems, there was a general feeling among trade unionists that if the problems were left alone, they would in time, solve themselves. 'But', as  H.  D.  Hughes,  Principal  of  Ruskin  College  put  it,  'the  emergence  of Powellism  means  that  the  problems  can  no  longer  be  left  to  solve themselves.' He added, 'The trade unions have tended to take the view that a  worker  is  a  worker  is  a  worker;  all  workers  should  be  treated  equally. When trade unions were asked how far immigrant workers participated in education programmes, most unions replied that they could not say because as a matter of principle, they took no steps to find out.' 157

Trade unions were concerned with the capacities of individuals and with their  needs,  and  neither  needs  nor  capacities  depend  essentially  on  sex, colour,  race  or  religion.  Furthermore,  as  experience  has  shown  the  trade union movement can be weakened if workers are divided as instanced in the dichotomy  between  white  workers  who  isolated  themselves  from  black workers. Employers, of course, would not hesitate to exploit such divisions. Also to be borne in mind, is the fact that the history of trade unionism in Britain shows that there had been a constant need to overcome difficulties which  arose from  prejudice and shortsightedness and to extend the boundaries of trade unionism effectively to include groups which initially had not been within them. In this context, it was essential to bring into full participation groups which had linguistic and cultural differences.

## Comparative trade union membership

By 1976, there were significant findings on the relationship between black workers  and  the  trade  unions. Asians  and  West  Indians  arrived  in  Britain from  countries  with  a  different  structure  of  industrial  relations,  but  they nonetheless readily joined the British trade union movement. Significantly, by the mid-1970s, trade union membership among these black workers was 'higher' among the minority groups than the white population.

Among male members of these groups in employment, 61 per cent were trade union members compared with 47 per cent of white males. There were however  some  differences  between  minority  groups,  with  African  and Asians  being  the  group  with  the  'lowest'  membership.  For  them,  the Grunwick strike was both an historic beginning and a bitter failure of trade unionism. Taken together, however, these minority groups still had a higher level of union membership among each group taken separately than among Whites. Disadvantaged women (except Moslem working women, comparatively  low  with  an  18  per  cent  membership)  reflected  a  different picture in that about one in three working women from the minority groups were  union  members,  which  was  about  the  'same  level'  as  the  union membership of white women.

Whether or not Asians and West Indians made a positive choice to join unions, or just happened to be working in certain kinds of jobs in certain types of industries or plants which were unionised, their high membership needs  further  explanation.  A  study  of  the  job  level  analysis  showed  that among  non-manual  and  skilled  manual  workers,  the  levels  of  union

membership were about the same for the Whites and the minorities. Among the semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers, however, membership was 'distinctly higher' for Asians and West Indians than for Whites. 158

Although there was a tendency for the minorities to work in unionised industries, as Smith points out, this only partially explained the differences between the minorities and Whites. In fact, even confinement of an analysis to  unionised plants still revealed that in these plants both Asian and West Indian men at each job level (including non-manual and skilled levels) were more likely to join a trade union than was the case with white men. Even so, contrary to the expectations that an 'incompletely adapted minority' group would  show  a  low  level  of  union  membership,  the  findings  showed  the opposite to be true.

Clearly  then,  black  workers  had  not  been  reluctant  to  become  trade union  members.  This  must  have  surprised  white  working  class  trade unionists who, while arguing that cultural and language factors would pose problems of integration, found Asians who did not (at least during the early years of immigration) speak fluent English (and who were isolated from the mainstream of British life) but had joined unions in large numbers. In fact, it was found that among Asian men who spoke no English at all 60 per cent were  union  members.  Moreover,  while  those  who  had  arrived  in  Britain earlier were  considered to be the most  likely candidates for union membership,  it  was  also  found  that  among  the  most  recent  arrivals  (for example, those who came to Britain from 1970 onwards) the level of union membership was no lower than it was among Whites. In fact, at 47 per cent it was 'exactly the same'. 159

Union policy The foregoing findings clearly show then that Asians and West Indians  who  came  to  Britain  (essentially  for  economic  reasons)  had  a marked  degree  of  confidence  in  trade  unions  to  uphold  their  rights  and privileges and to protect theirs and the interests of all workers. Undoubtedly, this was the acid test of the British working class movement to implement  its  'brotherhood  of  man'  ideal.  Indeed,  historically  the attempts of distressed colonial workers to form trade unions have received support  through  resolutions  and  letters  of  encouragement  from  individual unions  and  trades  councils  in  Britain.  Now  that  the  ravages  of  colonial poverty led colonial workers to seek jobs in Britain, it seemed natural that they should join the trade union movement. Thus, the British trade union

movement was faced with practising what it had for so long been preaching. The  common  purpose  of  mixed  workforces  was  clear  to  trade  unionists. Thus, the framework within which black workers were to be accommodated was encapsulated at  the Trades  Union  Congress  in  1955  in  the  following resolution condemning racial discrimination:

This Congress condemns all manifestations of racial discrimination or colour prejudices whether by Governments, employers or workers. It urges the General Council to lose no opportunity to make the  trade  union  attitude  on  this  issue  perfectly  clear  and  to  give special attention to the problems emerging in this country from the influx  of  fellow  workers  of  other  races  with  a  view  to  removing causes of friction.

The  problem  of  such  worthy  policy  is  its  practical  result.  Were  the unions desirous of being seen to be doing something or were they genuine initiators  of  change  among union officials? Further, was it indeed another instance of official  trade  union  rhetoric? The  General  Secretary  of  one  of the largest unions had no doubt: 'It's the same with this as with so many other union matters', he said, 'the bullshit beats the brains everytime.'

This failure to confront the problem squarely at the outset would cause havoc within the movement in years to come. But how did the unions deal in  practice  with  the TUC resolution? The condemnation of discrimination implied four kinds of action: (i) steps to deal with any cases that come to light where trade unionists were discriminating; (ii) energetic representation of any workers from minority groups who were being discriminated against by management; (iii) steps to ensure that union grievance procedures were adopted  to  take  care  of  complaints  with  a  racial  element,  that  the  racial minorities understand the procedures and that they use them to the full; and (iv) that steps be taken to ensure a rapid feed-back of information to higher union levels about cases of alleged discrimination and situations where it might be likely to develop. 160

Furthermore, in response to giving 'special problems' emerging in the hope of 'removing causes of friction and preventing exploitation', the PEP report recommended further action such as: arrangements for the induction of new members from the minority groups into the theory and practice of trade unions, the inclusion of information and discussion on race relations

in  training  courses  for  shop  stewards  and  other  union  officials,  active encouragement  to  members  of  the  minority  groups  to  take  part  in  the movement  as shop stewards, convenors and full-time officials, and discussions with management and joint policies to improve race relations in industry.

Contact with management Following the TUC resolution, contact between the  unions  and  management  on  racial  issues  was  necessary.  Among  the employers  asked  whether  they  had  had  any  contact  with  trade  unions  on race relations policy, only 8 per cent said they had and even the plants with at  least  5  per  cent  from  minority  groups  said  this  figure  was  only  10  per cent. There was also evidence that formal opposition from the union to the employment  of  racial  minorities  was  rare.  Indeed  only  3  per  cent  of  the plants  surveyed  said  that  a  union  had  any  disagreement  with  their  policy. Moreover, the percentage was no higher among plants with high concentrations  of  minorities.  Further,  generally  managers  did  not  feel  the trade unions tended to resist the introduction of minority workers. In fact, only 3 per cent of plants thought they did so. On the other hand, 5 per cent felt that they supported it and 52 per cent thought that they just accepted it. The balance of 40 per cent had no opinion. However, 25 per cent of plants said that there were complaints from white workers when minority workers were employed, complaints rarely formalised by the trade unions. The two conclusions  drawn  from  these  findings  were  that  although  there  were notable cases of formal confrontation between unions and management over racial  issues,  this  was  an  unusual  situation;  and  secondly,  that  unions  at local level were reluctant to make representations to management on behalf of minority workers on racial matters or to suggest positive policies.

The survey also found that there was very little evidence of any contact between  senior  management  and  trade  union  representatives  on  racial issues.  The  exceptions  were  situations  where  racial  conflicts  had  been serious enough to force some attention from Board members. Even in these cases, however, generally discussions were conducted with union officers at local or district level, thus forestalling a top-level meeting between senior management and the union leaders. 161

Overall then, on race issues, there was little contact between management  and  unions.  In  effect,  while  the  unions  have  rarely  made

formal  representations  against  racial  minorities,  they  had  seldom  made positive representations.

The situation at the plant According to the PEP report, there were situations which  fell  into  two  groups  where  the  trade  union  at  local  level  was  not acting  within  the  framework  of  official  TUC  policy.  Firstly,  there  were instances where the local union was encouraging discrimination rather than counteracting it; and secondly, while the union was not directly involved in discriminatory practices, nevertheless situations had developed partly because of inadequate representation. 162 The first case of union involvement in discriminatory practices, implicated a district official of the TGWU. According to the Asian Branch Secretary of the union there was collusion  between  the  management  and  the  district  official  to  prevent Asians  from  being  promoted  to  bus  inspector.  The  PEP  report  stated  that there were 'strong reasons' for thinking that the allegation was justified, and that  'While  this  particular  case  could  not  be  proved  in  law,  the  general reasons which we have given for thinking that discrimination is occurring are powerful ones.'

In  another  case  of  union  involvement  the  plant  management  admitted that while they had previously excluded minority workers altogether, they had first decided to change this policy before the 1968 Race Relations Act. The  union,  however,  argued  that  it  was  the Act  which  brought  about  the change. Nonetheless, once the decision was  taken management  had meetings  with  trade  union  representatives  to  get  their  reactions  to  the introduction of racial minorities. The union representatives told management that there would be 'strong opposition'. 163 When asked if they themselves had any objection, they said they were expressing the views of their membership. Lucky for them, there was no real disagreement with the white 'brothers and sisters' in the union.

Whatever the opposition of the white workforce to the employment of Blacks, the shortage of labour prompted the employment of a small number of black workers, mainly Asians. By the time they had accounted for 5 per cent of the workforce, conflict emerged. Both the AUEW shop steward and the TGWU convenor agreed that white workers resented the Asian workers and  that  social  contact  between  them  was  minimal.  Basically,  the  white workers  feared  that  the  plant  would,  in  time,  become  Asian  dominated. Thus they resisted Asian entry strongly. Whatever prior feelings

management  had for their Asian workers, pressure from the white workforce  aroused  little  enthusiasm  for  employing  more  black  workers. But,  of  course,  there  was  the  essential  pressure  of  a  labour  shortage  to consider. How they wished there was no such shortage. Eventually, the fear of  white  resistance  won  through,  although  there  had  been  'no  formal discussions'  between  the  two  sides.  Indeed  there  had  been  no  intra-union discussion because the shop steward and convenor were 'too embarrassed' to raise the matter at union meetings.

In  one  case  the  attitudes  of  both  union  representatives  were  most revealing.  The  AUEW  shop  steward  was  frank.  He  regarded  'coloured' people as 'dirt'. Although he was barely tolerant of an Italian or Pole living next door, he said if a Pakistani came to live next door, 'I would spit'. 164 On the other hand, the TGWU convenor was 'liberal-minded' and 'conciliatory'  in  his  approach.  Thus,  by  not  discussing  and  raising  racial issues at higher union levels, the union's negative attitudes helped to justify any racially discriminatory policy adopted by management. More damning than the attitude of the local union representation is the fact that there were cases where the full-time union officials had not acted because the workers were  Asians.  In  this  kind  of  situation,  the  union  would  normally  be expected to deal with the situation as a matter of course, if the workers were white. But they chose to act differently by ignoring black workers and not making any 'special efforts', 'with a view to preventing exploitation' in line with the TUC resolution.

Apart from showing that the unions at local level have sometimes been involved in discriminatory practices, the above examples more importantly question whether the minority workers have fully entered into the mainstream  of  the  trade  union  movement,  and  whether  (given  their  faith and confidence as union members) they are able to contribute to, or benefit from it to the same extent as white workers. Of course, there were the rare cases where things were marginally better, as in the case of a plant which had  a  workforce  of  which  over  90  per  cent  belonged  to  minority  groups. Predictably (and the clue was 'little' white labour) the work was repetitive, mostly  unskilled  and  was  done  in  'very  bad  conditions'.  The  TGWU membership was high. This was entirely due to the efforts of a West Indian convenor. As representative of a predominantly black workforce, it was not surprising  that  his  complaints  and  accusations  against  management  were 'comprehensive'. Most of his specific complaints, however, were found to

be unjustified because his arguments, it seemed, were based on 'anti-White' prejudice.  Nonetheless,  the  downright  bad  physical  working  conditions  in the plant were only improved because of union pressure. As the PEP report stated: 'This is a case where the benefits of trade unionism are being felt by a largely West Indian workforce, and where a West Indian has been able to channel his energies through the movement, but without special encouragement from higher levels in the union.' 165

On balance, the cases where individual union officials have represented the  cause  of  racial  minorities  are  far  outweighed  by  the  cases  where  the trade  union  has  failed  to  give  adequate  representation  or  where  it  was directly involved in discriminatory practices.

Action from the centre Interviews with eight of the largest unions at head office  level  showed  that  there  was  little  evidence  of  any  definite  action taken by the centre. Indeed, most unions avoided matters that were likely to lead to specific action because they feared that white members might think that minorities were being given special treatment. Moreover, this approach was sometimes justified by stating that the action specifically on behalf of minority groups would be discriminatory.

Furthermore,  none  of  the  eight  unions  knew  how  many  of  their members belonged  to  minority  groups,  and  none  could  give  more  than  a rough  estimate  of  the  number  of  part-time  officers  from  these  groups.  In fact, (at the time of the PEP report) there were virtually no full-time officers from  minority  groups.  Although  the  unions  were  aware  of  this,  none  of them proposed to do anything about it.

While  there  were  an  unspecified  (indeed  they  recorded  just  about everything else) number of shop stewards from minority groups elected by mixed workforces, senior trade unionists felt that the minorities representation was woefully inadequate. Given that 'you have to be a nut case' to want to be a shop steward, and that no special encouragement had been  given,  it  is  surprising  that  a  number  of  black  shop  stewards  have emerged.  Justifying  their  passive,  non-caring  attitude,  trade  union  leaders insisted that it would be wrong to interfere with the democratic process; an attitude  that  was  dangerously  close  to  saying  that  any  show  of  initiative from the leadership would be undemocratic! 166

Although  the  TGWU  took  on  its  first  black  full-time  official  the minority groups remained well outside the higher levels of the trade unions.

In this, as in other major unions with a large black membership, there was no  systematic  policy  of  inducting  part-time  officials  in  race  relations problems. In open discussion of the issues in this vital area of day-to-day relationships,  the  unions  remained  unmoved.  They  did  little  to  educate minority  groups  in  the  history,  purposes  and  practices  of  the  trade  union movement. And in spite of grievance procedures, head office either did not care or did not want to know of complaints of racial discrimination within the union.

In sum, the evidence showed that few positive initiatives called for in the TUC resolution had been taken from the centre; and that in the known cases,  there  had  been  no  action  to  combat  discrimination.  The  main argument used by trade union leaders for not taking positive action was that they had to take account of the views of the membership and could not go too far ahead of them. More explicitly, this argument is that the unions are democratic, that they could therefore only act in accordance with the wishes of the majority of their members and that the membership was not ready to accept specific policies of equal opportunity.

## In principle: TUC policy and resolutions

The TUC., black workers and immigration (1955-73)

Before 1955, there was no reference either in the General Council report to Congress or during the Conference proceedings, to 'race relations', racial discrimination or immigration in relation to Britain. As the TUC saw it, the arrival of New Commonwealth immigrants (particularly West Indians) was not cause for undue concern. This period, however, did see the emergence of an 'attitude' to immigration.

In 1954 the General Council was consulted by the Minister of Labour about  a  code  to  be  signed  by  members  of  the  Organisation  for  European Economic Co-operation which would deal with the admission of citizens of other  countries  for  employment  purposes. According  to  the  Council,  'the policies  underlying  the  code  were  in  conformity  with  current  British practice,  namely  that  full  regard  must  be  taken  of  the  interests  of  British workers before permits are granted to workers from the OEEC countries. Permits were not given if this would result in displacing British workers.

There must be no under-cutting of British standards and the views of trade unions and employers organisations in the industry must be respected.' 167

This argument of 'economic nationalism' (relevant to the mass unemployment of the 1930s, in the 1970s and now in the 1980s) was by the mid-1960s,  not  the  'main  plank'  of  opposition  to  New  Commonwealth immigration. The Council's opposition was based on the immigrant's failure to  'integrate'  rather  than  the  argument  that  they  were  taking  the  jobs  of British workers. In 1955, however, the latter view was an implicit concern on occasions. By 1955, 'Immigration from the Commonwealth amounted to no more than a paragraph in the report to the 1955 TUC which referred to the withdrawal of a resolution by the Ministry of Labour Staff Association from  the  1954  Agenda,  so  that  the  General  Council  might  consider  the subject.' After  this  decision,  the  MLSA  submitted  a  memorandum  to  the Council concerning black workers and immigration. 168

In  response  to  this  memorandum,  the  General  Council  requested  a meeting with the Minister of Labour. They stressed two points: (i) the need for the government to formulate an immigration policy for people from the Commonwealth and that 'colour' should be excluded from this policy; and (ii)  that  since  it  was  the  reponsibility  of  the  government  to  maintain  full employment  it  should  necessarily  have  a  policy  to  ensure  immigration control.  This  was  explicit  enough.  In  effect,  the  TUC  was  calling  for immigration control as far back as 1955. Thus the TUC 'implicitly defined' New Commonwealth immigration as a problem. 169

In  the  context  of  this  general  'problem',  the  following  motion  was moved by T.J. O'Dea at the 1955 Congress by the Civil Service Clerical Association:

This Congress condemns all manifestations of racial discrimination or colour prejudice whether by governments, employers or workers. It urges the General Council to lose no opportunity to make the trade union  attitude  on  this  issue  perfectly  clear  and  to  give  special attention to the problems emerging in this country from the influx of fellow workers of other races with the view to removing causes of friction and preventing exploitation. 170

This motion was strengthened by a similar motion on 'racial discrimination' from the Association of Cinematograph and Allied Technicians. 171 Both  motions  were  formally  seconded  and  carried.  It  was well-known among General Council members that employers were practising  discrimination.  In  his  speech,  although  he  suggested  that  the Council had certain responsibilities, the mover of the CSCA motion did not see  the  need  for  action  by  affiliated  trade  union  leaders  or  rank  and  file members.  The  mover  of  the  CSCA  motion,  aware  of  working  class prejudice and friction, did not feel that the TUC and the trade unions should oppose the reactions of white workers. Instead, he was concerned that black workers might become a pool of cheap labour.

The  1955  Congress  was  therefore  instructive.  While  in  principle,  it condemned  racial discrimination or colour prejudice, it nevertheless 'implicitly accepted' that the 'problem' was not the expression of prejudice or discriminatory  practice  by  white  employers  and  workers,  but  was attributable to the very presence of immigrants from the West Indies. This was reflected by the General Council's view of immigration control and the failure  of  Congress  even  to  consider  (never  mind  taking  positive  action) against the prejudice and discrimination practised by white workers.

Between  1956  and  1957,  there  seemed  to  have  been  little  interest  in immigration  and  race  relations  at  the  Congress.  However,  in  the  General Council's report to the 1956 Congress there was a paragraph on 'Immigration from the Commonwealth'. This suggested that Commonwealth  immigration  had  taken  precedence  over  the  issues  of prejudice and discrimination, issues on which the TUC continued to pay lip service and little else. Of course, no one can deny their good intentions and broad statements of principle.

The National Union of Railwaymen had contacted the General Council and  declared  its  support  for  some  form  of  immigration  control.  It  was therefore  not  surprising  that  in reporting  the  suggestion  that  conflict between  black  and  white  workers  should  be  monitored  by  the  General Council in tandem with the National Union of Railwaymen's demand for immigration  control,  the  Council  was  yet  again,  'indirectly  linking  the negative reaction of white workers to the arrival of West Indian workers and suggesting that this would be best dealt with by immigration control'. 172

By the end of 1957 then, there was no clear and positive response from the TUC to the claim that black workers were subjected to the prejudice and discrimination of white workers. Furthermore the monitoring of 'instances of friction' seemed to have been shelved.

During 1958, the year of the race riots in Nottingham and Notting Hill, the TUC General Council still viewed immigration as 'the problem'. On the other  hand,  they  did  not  see  racism  as  part  of  their  responsibility.  In  the cases where racism was admitted to exist, trade unionists were not among those  to  be  blamed.  Instead  attention  was  deflected  to  the  resurgence  of fascist  and  racist  political  organisations.  What  they  forgot  to  take  into consideration in such calculations was the fact that trade unionists were also political activists. Given these self-imposed limitations, the area of action to be taken by the TUC was narrowed. Thus the view prevailed that it was the responsibility  of  the  New  Commonwealth  immigrants  themselves  to  take action. In effect, it was up to them to adjust, as best they could, to their new and hostile environment.

The effect of the 1958 race riots was to highlight the problems of black people  in  Britain.  As  a  national  body,  the  TUC.,  concerned  with  the 'brotherhood of man' was forced to respond. When the 1958 Congress met after  the  riots,  a  delegate  from  the  Clerical  and  Administrative  Workers Union reflected a new-found sense of urgency. He stated that 'the problem' of racial discrimination was now 'on our doorsteps' and argued that it was not only a matter for the police and the magistrates: 'As one of the most powerful organisations in the community we should undertake our responsibilities and give what leadership and guidance we can in order to try to help.' 173

He  concluded  that  trade  unionists  should  take  every  opportunity  to oppose cases of prejudice. Moreover, they should assist in the process of 'integration' and that the General Council should consider positive action in order to prevent a recurrence of violence. These statements were historic. Not only was it the first open recognition at Congress that there was racial prejudice in Britain, it was also the first time an argument was put forward to suggest that because the trade unions had a direct responsibility to deal with racial prejudice they should adopt a programme of action.

The question of immigration in fact appeared in the General Council's report  to  the  1958  Congress.  Concern  was  expressed  over  the  lack  of control of immigration from the Commonwealth (with the permit system to

regulate  foreign  workers)  and  on  the  distinction  between  Commonwealth immigrants who were passport-holders and those who were not, particularly in relation to Pakistani immigrants. Finally, the Report, leaving no room for ambiguity, concluded:

It was suggested to the Minister of Labour that controls adopted by other  self-governing  Commonwealth  countries  should  be  studied and that it would be suitable for Britain to adopt some measures of control over would-be immigrants for whom no job is waiting or is likely to be available. It was  also suggested that a medical examination should be included within these immigration controls.

Here  then  we  have  a  turn  up  for  the  books.  The  so-called  pro-labour movement people were demanding immigration control while the Conservative Minister of Labour stated that the government was 'unwilling to contemplate a departure from the traditional readiness of this country to receive citizens of British status'. 174

On reflection, therefore, in his speech, TUC General Secretary, Vincent Tewson,  was  not  so  much  expressing  a  personal  opinion  on  immigration control, as also reiterating the General Council's position. The Tories could not  have  been  happier.  Indeed  these  views  assisted  the  Conservative government  in  preserving  the  'traditional  readiness  of  this  country  to receive citizens of British status', while controlling 'coloured' immigration. A  year  later,  in  1959,  the  Council  was  pleased  with  the  'overwhelming support'  it  had  received  from  the  trade  union  movement  on  immigration control. Exuding self-satisfaction, the General Council also included in its report to Congress, discussions with West Indian government officials about the  problems of housing and the question of 'learning to live together' in Britain.  The  rhetoric  continued  with  the  Council  determined  to  keep  'the problem' under continuous review. 175

But although 'the anything for an easy life' approach won through, the thorn in their side (the Clerical and Administrative Workers Union) had its say. This union's position was clearly at variance with that adopted by the General Council. Referring to this section of the report, the CAWU delegate Ms  J.  Mellors  reminded  delegates  of  the  gap  between  the  passage  of Conference resolutions and the actual day-to-day practice on the shopfloor. Surely there was more to be done in dealing with racial prejudice. 176

This direct demand for urgent action on the shopfloor was counteracted and,  as  it  were,  floored  by  a  more  'acceptable'  (and  typically  rhetorical evasion  by  shifting  the  emphasis  from  the  present  to  some  future  time) motion  moved  by  the  Chemical  Workers'  Union.  This  tactical  motion deplored 'the racial violence' of the race riots and in calling for legislation to prevent racial discrimination, qualified this legal measure by stating that the  law  had  only  limited  usefulness,  and  as  such,  'the  hope  for  racial tolerance  lies  with  the  younger  generation'. 177 Although  the  motion  was carried,  strong  dissent  was  expressed  by  the  Transport  Salaried  Staff Association who called for immediate action, the mover adding 'I say that nobody  has  any  greater  responsibility  at  the  present  time  than  our  great Trade  Union  Movement.' 178 In  spite  of  the  arguments  put  forward,  the Trade Union Movement was still not clear what action could be taken. As it was, the situation prevailed for the next sixteen years.

The  issues  of  immigration  and  race  relations  were  not  debated  at Congress for the next five years. The relevance of the race riots to the TUC 'faded away' after reference to it in the 1960 Congress Report. 179  During this  period,  however,  there  was  a  change  in  emphasis  regarding  black workers. The General Council began to campaign for a policy of 'integration' and opposition to any special provision for black workers. In other  words,  they  were  hoping  to  achieve  parity  regardless  of  racial disadvantage.

Between  1960  and  1964  the  Council's  main  preoccupation  was  the Commonwealth  Immigration Bill which it decided to oppose in a statement. 180 The  statement  itself,  however,  did  not  oppose  immigration control in principle. In fact, the statement implied that immigration should be  limited  by  the  country  of  origin,  reflecting  the  view  expressed  by Tewson at the 1958 Congress. In essence, there was no real contradiction between the General Council's position on immigration as stated in 1955 and 1958, and that expressed in opposing the Commonwealth Immigration Bill  in  1962.  Interestingly  there  was  also  no  debate  at  Congress  of  the Council's Report in 1964. 181

The themes of 'integration' and opposition to any special provision for black  workers  became  a  fundamental  part  of  the  TUC's  discussions  and representations. They remained silent on racial prejudice and discrimination,  which  was  spreading  and  becoming  more  entrenched  as

reflected in disputes at the workplace. The problem was much too pervasive and hit at the very root of the trade union movement. Thus, not surprisingly, the above themes provided the rationale for the TUC's failure to act.

It was  clear,  then,  that  the  trade  union  movement  had  no  special obligations towards black workers. Learning 'British ways' and joining the trade unions were all the black worker needed to do, as it were, to put right the wrongs. In fact, doing these things was precisely 'the problem' for the black migrants. Indeed, except for the token gesture, it has been shown that those  who  suffered  most  from  racial  discrimination  were  those  most integrated. In effect, for so long as the immigrants toed the TUC line, there was no necessity to make special provision.

The  TUC's  vague  position  became  somewhat  more  positive  between 1965  and  1966  following  the  Labour  government's  line  by  supporting legislative control of immigration. As far as the majority of trade unionists were  concerned,  racial  discrimination  was  not  a  reality  and  urgent  trade union action to eliminate it was therefore not necessary.

But why did the General Council come out in the open for immigration control? According to the 1965 Congress Report, two changed circumstances  led  to  a  reappraisal  of  its  opposition  to  immigration  as expressed  in  1961.  The  first  of  these  changes  was  'the  growth  of  the proportion  of  Commonwealth immigrants lacking an adequate knowledge of English and of British customs'; the second was the arrival of the wives and children of earlier immigrants which put into perspective the fact that whereas  many  immigrants  were  becoming  settled  with  their  families  in sufficient numbers to require access to the full range of opportunity at every level of British life, progress towards their integration was in some aspects being  reversed  as  the  numbers  became  large  enough  to  constitute  an extension  of  their  previous  environments.  Moreover,  it  was  feared  this would lead towards their settlement 'as a series of communities, differentiated from themselves as from the main body of the population'. 182

One  of  the  General  Council's  particular  concerns,  among  others,  was that  the  existing  system  handed  over  considerable  control  of  immigration policy to immigration officials at the expense of 'interested bodies such as the  TUC',  which  was  not  invited  to  comment.  Again  in  the  General Council's 1966 Report to Congress, the TUC showed concern over being consulted about immigration control. To this effect, they had corresponded with the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour. In the latter case, they

felt  'it  was  desirable  to  recruit  workers  who  would  adapt  themselves'. 183 They were also concerned about the position the Commonwealth immigrant was placed in concerning the possibility of permanent residence in Britain compared to the alien. As it was the black immigrant worker was already a victim of increasing alienation. The message was clear enough; adaptability was the pre-requisite for permanent residence.

Indeed  the  General  Council's  change  of  policy  was  shaped  most significantly by the increasing number of immigrants from the Indian subcontinent who were strict adherents to their social and cultural backgrounds. In  fact  they  did  not  follow  'British  ways'  and  intended  to  maintain  their distinctive  life  style.  This  was  precisely  what  the  General  Council  was afraid of. To 'integrate' and 'adapt' were the dominant themes. Consequently,  they  supported  immigration  control  so  long  as  it  did  not distinguish  between  alien  and  Commonwealth  immigrants.  To  surrender one's racial characteristics in a racist society was to commit double-suicide, something  most  immigrants  were  unwilling  to  do.  Many  members  of  the British working class regarded themselves as tolerant. By implication they were not prejudiced and did not discriminate. They were therefore not part of 'the problem'. Thus the blame was shifted, and 'the problem' became the beliefs and behaviour of the immigrants themselves. Thus, controlling the numbers was imperative. It was necessary that the number of immigrants should  not  'become  large  enough  to  constitute  an  extension  of  their previous  environments'.  The  consequence  of  this  was  that  immigration from  these  countries  with  undesirable  'social  and  cultural  norms  and values'  should  either  be  reduced  or  stopped  altogether.  This  policy  of integration  by  the  TUC  must  be  related  to  the  Labour  government's approach  to  immigration  from  the  Commonwealth.  With  the  1965  White Paper,  'integration  began  to  assume  the  proportions  of  a  philosophy'. 184 The Labour government's strategy was to bring together (and they knew the problems of racial discrimination very well) the worsening problem of race relations with immigration control. Thus, it was hoped that by introducing legislation in the form of the Race Relations Act 1965, the problems arising from black immigration could be dealt with, thus reinforcing the argument for control.

The influence of the Labour Party on the General Council was evident by the time of the 1966 Congress. During the Congress the TUC and the Labour Party were agreed on policy. This was the 'top down' perspective

with the - black workers' experience being totally ignored. Thereafter, the TUC became increasingly 'integrated' in the process of government. TUC representatives  sat  on  various  statutory  bodies  set  up  by  the  Labour government.  Trade  union  approval  was  of  course  important  in  carrying through Labour Party policies while in government. However, the TUC did oppose both Labour and Conservative government policy on the question of the extent of anti-discriminatory legislation, until 1973.

At  the  98th  Congress,  in  a  motion  moved  by  the  National  Union  of Journalists,  the  TUC  re-affirmed  its  opposition  to  all  forms  of  racial discrimination. 185

The period 1967-8 was significant. In 1967 the PEP report on the extent of  racial  discrimination  was  published  and  the  government  had  plans  to include  employment  within  the  new  Race  Relations  Act.  The  General Council argued that the report dealing with discrimination only at one given point in time failed to establish the 'extent or speed' of 'integration' and as a consequence,  did  not  draw  a  'clear  distinction  between  problems  arising with  new  immigrants  and  those  which  might  be  characteristic  of  a  fully settled population, nor could the report relate changes in the situation to the extent of union organisation or action'. 186 The TUC's  'integration' argument  was  beginning  to  assume  a  hidebound  quality.  The  General Council was not pleased with the findings of the PEP report; thus it became irrelevant.

The General Council came round to thinking that the existing voluntary procedures might not be sufficient. It was able to convince the Confederation  of  British  Industry  of  this  and  together  they  issued  a  joint statement in June 1967, calling for 'a new central body with an independent Chairman which would receive complaints and refer them to the appropriate industrial machinery or deal directly with them if there was no absence of voluntary arbitration at the local level'. This modification of the General  Council's  view  led  it  to  reluctantly  agree  that  legislation  might have a role to play, after all. Thereafter, the Council was more preoccupied with details of the legislation rather than the principle and practical use of the law in industrial relations.

The 1968 Race Relations Act did not get the full support of the Council. However, during the 1968 Congress, the activities among the rank and file delegates were yet again (the Council's views were 'seriously challenged' in

1967)  to  put  the  General  Council  to  the  test.  Racial  discrimination  was emphasised,  not  'integration'.  The British  Actor's Equity  Association delegate moved this motion:

This Congress notes with concern that there are social and Working Men's Clubs which practise racial discrimination in regard both to admission  to  the  clubs  and  to  the  engagement  of  performers. Congress  endorses  the  action  taken  by  the  performer's  unions  in instructing their members to refuse engagements in such clubs and asks the General Council to call upon all affiliated unions to support the performers' unions in this matter by any means open to them. 187

The motion seconded by the Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers received the support of the delegates from the National Union of Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers and the Musicians' Union. During the debate reference was made to discrimination in working men's clubs  and  the  double-standards  of  the  trade  union  movement.  Then  the Musicians'  Union  delegate  delved  deeper.  He  argued,  it  was  time  'to  get past  the  concern  stage  and  on  to  the  support  stage'.  In  short,  he  felt  the motion demanded strike action. He spoke of 'direct action' and demanded that  each  union  should  commit  itself  by  making  a  clear  statement  to  its members;  and  that  it  should  consider  the  extent  to  which  it  could  act  in concert  with,  or  even  initiate,  industrial  action.  These  were  more  than militant  gestures. They  were  a  rallying  cry  to  take  a  stand. The  Congress delegates  responded.  The  motion  was  carried.  The  General  Council  now faced  the  challenge  of  taking  positive  action  against  racial  discrimination crucially within  the trade union  movement  itself.  Clearly,  top-heavy, authoritarian  directives  were  no  longer  viable.  How  then  would  the  TUC act?

The  years  1969-73  marked  the  General  Council's  involvement  in established  government  machinery  dealing  with  race  relations.  By  all accounts,  the  General  Council  was  more  concerned  with  integration  and immigration. Therefore, except in cases of racial discrimination in working men's clubs, it  did  not  initiate  any  'racial  discrimination'  moves.  Instead, the  Council  clung  to  its  integration  position  stubbornly,  until  1973  when delegates  from  the  floor  of  Congress  organised  another  attack  on  its position.

Opposition came from the Civil and Public Services Association which moved a lengthy motion criticising the government 'for refusing to allow an amnesty for illegal immigrants subject to the retroactive provisions of the 1971 Act and for use of the officers of the Department of Health and Social Security  as  part  of  the  law  enforcement  process'.  Finally,  the  motion requested that the next Labour government repeal the Act. The motion was supported  by  the  AEUW  delegate  who  believed  that  'the  basic  cause  of insecurity in the black and immigrant communities is the Act itself. 188

Significantly, no  delegate  spoke  against  the  motion.  The  General Council was stunned into awkward silence. The motion was carried. This was a historic victory for the rank and file. It was, in fact, the first time that a  motion  from  the  floor  during  a  Congress  had  changed  the  General Council's policy on either race relations or immigration. More importantly, it  marked  the  turning  point  in  the  TUC's  policy  toward  black  workers  in Britain.

## The TUC and black workers: the 1970s and 1980s

After  reaping  the  benefits  of  the  Keynesian  theory  of  full  employment, trade  union  power,  in  the  wake  of  the  'wild-cat'  strikes  during  the  1960s first threatened the government (a Labour government at the time) through its inquiry into the unions and industrial relations in the document 'In Place of Strife'. This was followed soon after by the Conservative Party study 'A Fair Deal At Work'.

Since 1944 governments of both parties had consulted and sought the advice  of  the  TUC  in  formulating  economic  policy.  The  growing  shop steward militancy had however  brought  criticism and needed  to be stemmed. Thus,  'In  Place  of  Strife'  was  the  first  attempt  to  restore  trade union  control  back  to  the  national  union  leadership.  Further,  the  'formal' and 'informal' systems of industrial relations revealed a major weakness in the TUC's ability to exercise control within the movement. 189  Faced with this dilemma, the TUC's advice, support and consultation in the formulation of national policy could not be relied upon if government was to carry out its policies.

As it  was,  economic  recession  had  brought  economic  paralysis  to  the British  economy  and  a  further  weakening  of  the  trade  union  movement. After  the  'winter  of  discontent'  (1978-9)  and  the  advent  of  the  Thatcher government  (and  its  monetarist  policies  which  dramatically  increased  the

number unemployed) the trade union movement was further weakened, to the dismay of trade union leaders. This weakness was reflected in the lack of TUC influence on government policy-making into the 1980s.

The Select Committee on Race Relations and Immigration stated: 'The record of the TUC is similar to that of the CBI, in that both organisations have  declared  their  opposition  to  racial  discrimination  but  have  taken wholly  inadequate  steps  to  ensure  that  their  members  work  effectively  to eradicate  it.'  Criticism  was  also  directed  to  the  TUC  from  within  its constituent unions: 'The evidence shows that positive initiatives of the kind called for in the TUC  resolution have not been taken to combat discrimination that is known to occur.' 190

In spite of these condemnations, no attempt was made to consider the policy and practice of the TUC  over the entire period of New Commonwealth immigration. The conflict between the General Council and sections of Congress on the link between the question of immigration with that of the relations between black and white workers during the period of New  Commonwealth  immigration showed that New  Commonwealth immigration and race relations had been 'consistently muddled together' by the General Council as a consequence of which it eventually came to hold the  position  that  black  immigrants  were  a  'problem'  and  their  arrival  in Britain should therefore be controlled. 191

In  fact,  the  period  1954-73  showed  that  the TUC's  failure  to  act  was consistent with the way in which it had chosen to perceive the situation in Britain.  This  period  included  the  main  period  of  New  Commonwealth immigration to Britain and the latter date marks the time when a change in TUC policy began to become evident.

The written reports of the TUC were revealing. Firstly, they indicated that the General Council failed to acknowledge that there was 'considerable hostility' towards black workers among white trade unionists, and increasingly  came  to  adopt  the  position  that  the  problems  arose  from  the immigrants' refusal to integrate; secondly, that although the TUC stated its opposition  to  racial  discrimination  on  several  occasions,  those  manual unions  which  organised  the  vast  majority  of  black  workers  had  failed  to speak openly in favour of such motions; and thirdly, the reports indicated that, in spite of its 'principled' opposition to racial discrimination, the TUC

between 1968 and 1973, 'eventually came to accept at least implicitly that immigration should be controlled on a racial basis'.

Miles and Phizacklea have argued that

given the structural position of trade unions in the present stage of British  capitalist  development,  the  most  probable  reaction  of  the trade  unions  to  immigration  and  immigrant  workers  is  one  of hostility. In contrast to earlier immigrations,  TUC  hostility  to immigration  from  the  New  Commonwealth  was  principally  on social rather than economic grounds because in the 1950s and 1960s immigrant  workers  posed  no  direct  threat  to  the  jobs  of  British workers and 'integration', which had become the hallowed philosophy  of  successive  governments,  was  in  turn  uncritically adopted by the TUC. 192

As we have seen, the policy and practice of the TUC between 1954 and 1973 showed that the TUC failed to act positively because of the way in which  it  chose  to  define  the  position  of  black  workers  in  Britain,  and perhaps more particularly because of constraints placed on its initiatives by individual unions. They perceived a more serious problem in the unwillingness of black immigrants to 'integrate', thus transferring the onus for action on black workers. (In fact, black workers with no alternative and no  real  trade  union  support,  struck  in  several  intolerable  workplaces.) Moreover, the largest unions representing manual workers (the TGWU, for example) made no contributions to debates on 'race' and failed consistently to make a contribution to anti-discrimination motions. Further, the General Council was especially concerned with immigration from the New Commonwealth. However, although they consistently declared themselves opposed  to  any  form  of  racially  based  immigration  control,  they  did  not oppose the 1971 Immigration Act on these grounds until 1973.

Since  1974,  however,  new  TUC  policy  and  initiatives  have  emerged. Events, both internal and external to the trade union movement, had forced the TUC to re-evaluate its past policy and practice. Three developments had forced this re-evaluation. Firstly, a number of industrial disputes in the early 1970s  were  distinguished  by  (amongst  other  grievances)  complaints  by black workers of discrimination practised by trade union officials. Consequently, there was public criticism of both the trade unions involved

and  TUC  policy  and  practice.  Secondly,  since  the  1950s,  the  hidebound values of trade unionism in the face of a grievance-ridden black workforce had brought mounting criticism at Annual TUC Congresses which received added thrust following these 'disputes'. And thirdly the growing support for the National Front heightened trade union concern. 193

## TUC policy 1974-76

In 1974 the TUC General Council reported to Congress 194  the submission of  a  memorandum  and  oral  evidence  to  the  Select  Committee  on  Race Relations and Immigration. To see the TUC memorandum in perspective, it should be related to the oral evidence presented to the Select Committee by representatives of the General Council. 195 The two dominant themes were firstly,  responding  to  a  specific  question,  the  TUC  representative  replied that, although white workers might refuse to work with black workers, such action was never sanctioned by the national and regional officials. 196 This meant,  after  all,  a  recognition  that  white  trade  unionists  do  engage  in discriminatory practice. And secondly, in response to a question concerning the  TUC's  view  of  the  need  for  an  equal  opportunity  policy  in  union agreements, the TUC representative said that this indicated their belief that the situation was serious.

The Select Committee Report marked a 'watershed' in the history of the TUC's policy and practice concerning black workers. The arguments from the floor of the 1958 Congress (echoed by an official House of Commons Committee) were raised yet again at the 1974 Congress. In response to the General Council's report on its memorandum to the Select Committee, the Association  of  Scientific  Technical  and  Managerial  Staff's  delegate,  S. Jefferson, welcomed 'an important shift in the General Council's approach to  the  struggle  against  racial  discrimination'.  He  believed,  however,  the statement did not go far enough: 'What is needed is a determined attack by the trade union movement on racial discrimination, the development of antidiscrimination  trade  union  education  and  the  development  of  specialist trade union services to the section of our black and immigrant membership who have problems such as language difficulties.' 197 At the same Congress there  was  also  concern  about  the  General  Council's  attitude  to  the  1971 Immigration Act. On reflection, the ASTMS delegate argued that since the Council had not seriously pressed the government to remove the Act from

the statute book, it should now do so on the grounds that it was racist and anti-union.

Unfortunately, the great expectations of such delegates were  not satisfied at the 1975 Congress. The Report of this Congress did not indicate that  any  further  consideration  of  policy  was  being  undertaken  concerning black workers. 198 However, the TUC seemed proud to report that a model clause  on  equal  opportunities  had  been  drawn  up  and  circulated  to  union officials and representatives involved in negotiations at all levels.

By October 1974, following the House of Lords decision that Preston Dockers'  Labour  Club  were  not  guilty  of  unlawful  discrimination,  the General Council sent a letter to the Home Secretary stating their opposition to discrimination in working men's clubs on the grounds of colour, race or origin.  So  concerned  was  the TUC  on  this  issue  that  a  meeting  was  held with the Executive Committee of the Club and Institute Union to explore ways of ensuring the non-practice of discrimination in clubs.

Although the report of the 1975 Congress did not hold out much hope as far  as  policy-making  related  to  black  workers  was  concerned,  unusually, things  happened  quickly  thereafter.  In  October  of  that  year,  'a  major initiative' was taken by the General Council. 199 In  effect,  this  meant a reorganisation of existing arrangements to accommodate this new development.  Race  relations  and  discrimination,  the  responsibility  of  the International Committee was reallocated to become part of the Organisational and Industrial Relations Department. This change meant that the TUC felt the need to monitor these questions more effectively. To this end, it also proposed the setting-up of a new sub-committee of the General Council, the Equal Rights Committee. In December 1975, the ERC's terms of reference were put before the General Council for ratification. The focus of the Committee's work was on 'those fields where special and cumulative advantage  exists, for particular groups  linked  with  discrimination  on arbitrary  grounds  (such  as  race,  sex  or  religion)  and  generally  to  develop 'positive policies to promote equal opportunities'. In so doing, the ERC's task was to press for government legislation against arbitrary discrimination to  monitor  the  results  of  such  legislation.  The  Committee  also  had  to examine and monitor the policies of the TUC and affiliated unions on the question  of  equal  opportunity  and  to  approach  the  government  and  other

relevant bodies to act in accordance with the special needs of disadvantaged groups.

On the question of 'race relations' the General Council acknowledged the  need  for  special  consideration  and  accordingly  set  up,  in  December 1975, the Race Relations Advisory Committee. The ERC and RRAC were both expected to complement each other. The RRAC was composed of 13 members: 4  General  Council  members  and  9  trade  union  representatives, some  of  whom  were  also  members  of  minority  groups.  Tom  Jackson, General Secretary of the Union of Post Office Workers acted as Chairman of both the ERC and the RRAC. 200

After  setting  up  these  two  Committees,  the  General  Council  issued  a press release in July 1976 endorsing the work of these bodies. The Council stated: 'Much  needs  to  be  done  to  eliminate  the  discrimination  and disadvantage facing ethnic minorities and for their part the General Council are  advising  affiliated  unions  about  steps  they  should  take  to  strengthen trade  union  organisation  among  immigrant  and  black  workers  and  unity between  work  people.'  The  press  release  having  deplored  the  racialist activities  of  the  National  Front,  and  attempts  to  blame  unemployment  on black workers, also made its 'first mention' of a proposed campaign against racialism; a campaign that would also involve the Labour Party.

As it  was,  the  press  release  foreshadowed  what  was  to  happen  at  the 1976 Congress. The TUC's procrastination during earlier years now seemed irrelevant as it put forward a clear denunciation of racialism and the racist activities  of  the  National  Front  and  the  National  Party.  Overall,  the  mood was one of optimism. A motion on racialism, moved by Bill Keys, General Secretary  of  the  Society  of  Graphic  and Allied  Trades,  condemned  racist propaganda and called for a government ban on the National Front and the National Party. He also pointed to the danger posed by racialism to working class  unity  which  detracted  from  the  provision  of  equal  opportunities  for black and white workers and called upon the General Council to 'organise and invite' a national campaign against racialism.

Moreover,  referring  to  the  National  Front,  Keys  argued  that  'These people  who  peddle  race  hatred  are  no  different  from  the  people  who peddled the hatred in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s which led to the last war.' 201

Notable support came from Maurice Styles of the UPW who argued that the  roots  of  racialism  were  buried  in  everyone  and  as  a  consequence  it should  be  recognised  that  'earlier'  immigrants  were  becoming  today's citizens.  David  Basnett  (GMWU)  denounced  racialism  as  abhorrent  on moral, ethical and trade union grounds; and Jarvis Mahoney (British Actors Equity  Association),  one  of  the  few  black  delegates  at  Congress,  and interestingly one of the few to speak during this debate, called for action to stem rising unemployment and the alienation of black youth and argued in favour  of  'integrated  acting'  in  the  media.  Other  speakers  included  the delegate  from  NALGO  and  the  National  Union  of  Teachers,  the  latter arguing  for  positive  discrimination  in  favour  of  ethnic  minority  members for full-time  and  elected  posts. 202 The  debate  reflected  a  widespread feeling. The resolution was carried unanimously.

Thus  between  the  Congresses  of  1975  and  1976  the  General  Council and TUC policy and practice changed. Firstly, the General Council openly admitted that black workers faced disadvantage and discrimination, and that the serious problem of racialism should be strenuously opposed. Secondly, it was  clearly  recognised  that  the  trade  unions  should  actively  oppose racialism  within  their  own  ranks  (racialism  within  the  British  workforce) and should openly oppose racialist and fascist organisations. Thirdly (and reflecting a clear shift in emphasis), the stated issues requiring action were not  'integration'  of  the  immigrants,  but  racialism  and  the  activities  of  the National Front and the National Party; fourthly the General Council was in favour of giving special attention to 'race relations' through new organisational arrangements and by actively working towards equal opportunity;  and  fifthly,  apart  from  the  General  Council's  willingness  to speak out over the problems and dangers of racialism, it was also concerned with mobilising the labour movement in a campaign against it.

On  reflection,  by  1976,  the  General  Council  had  come  a  'long  way' since  its  policy  and  Memorandum  to  the  Select  Committee  in  1974  and dramatically since its policy and debates in the 1950s and 1960s. How did this change  come  about?  Three  developments  have  been  cited:  black workers  and  industrial conflict; the General  Council  critics, and  the National Front.

Black workers and industrial conflict

During  the  early  1970s,  black  workers  were  involved  in  a  number  of industrial disputes in which allegations of discrimination practised by white trade unionists were  made. 203   As Miles  and  Phizacklea  have  argued elsewhere,  the  General  Council  was,  at  least  up  until  1973,  unwilling  to accept publicly that white trade unionists engaged  in discriminatory practices.  In  fact,  this  position  had  been  flatly  contradicted  by  Mansfield Hosiery  Mills  and  Imperial  Typewriters  disputes,  among  others.  The weakness of the TUC's policy was therefore revealed and criticism came not only from black workers and a group of trade unionists opposed to the General Council's position, but also from official bodies.

Thus,  both  disputes  were  characterised  by  conflict  on  the  one  hand, between  Asian workers and management,  and  between  Asian  union members  and  union  officials,  on  the  other. Although  such  three-cornered disputes were not uncommon occurrences in the black workers' industrial experience  in  Britain,  in  the  cases  cited  above,  there  was  the  added dimension  of  allegations  of  racial  discrimination  by  Asian  workers  on strike, against both employer and union. And although the 'media led bias' had had some effect, what was abundantly clear in these two disputes was the fact that rank-and-file trade unionists and trade union officials 'could be guilty of discriminatory practice'.

Apart from the media criticism of the union's practice, the governmentsponsored  CIR  was,  as  already  shown,  seriously  concerned  about  the union's role vis-à-vis black workers. The CIR's view, publicly aired, flew in the face of the General Council's earlier argument that the problem was one of integration ('them' adopting 'our' ways) and immigration, and not that of the extent of discriminatory practice amongst white workers. Understandably, the Council was careful not to refer to these disputes at the Annual Congress.

In relating these disputes to the trade union movement and in particular to the TUC., it is necessary to consider the responses of senior trade union leaders. There was consensus on two points. Firstly, that the disputes had no immediate  or  direct  effect  on  the  General  Council  of  the  TUC;  and secondly, by contrast, that they did have a significant effect on the national leadership  of  the  unions  involved,  and  particularly,  the  TGWU.  This reflected  the  divide  between  the  unions  and  the  TUC.  It  was  argued  that because  trade  union  officials  were  extremely  busy,  and  in  the  absence  of

specific  events  to  jolt  their  consciousness  'there  was  little  reason  for considering the position and problems of black workers'.

## The General Council critics

The General Council's 'internally contradictory' policy since the mid-1950s has  often  been  challenged  by  delegates  at  Congress,  most  significantly  at the 1967 Congress by a motion moved by the Association of Cinematograph  Television  and  Allied  Technicians  in response  to the General Council's report on its opposition to the government's intention of extending  the  legislative  control  of  racial  discrimination  to  the  field  of employment. While re-affirming the TUC's condemnation of racial discrimination,  the  motion  expressing  concern  about  the  extent  of  racial discrimination  as  revealed  by  the  1967  PEP  study,  called  for  trade  union action to prevent discrimination, and endorsed the government's intentions to  make  racial  discrimination  in  employment  an  offence. 204 In  effect,  the motion  attempted  to  reverse  the  Council's  policy.  This  'most  significant challenge' to the Council's policy (though not the only one) indicated that a 'substantial  proportion'  of  trade  unionists  were  of  the  view  that  the  TUC should take positive action against racial discrimination.

Further evidence of the existence of opposition to the General Council policy was contained in the memorandum  submitted to the Select Committee  in  1974  by  the  Midland  Region  Trade  Union  Conference  to Combat  Racial  Discrimination.  The  memorandum's  argument  was  that white  workers  were  prejudiced  against  black  workers  on  the  grounds  of colour,  and  feared  that  it  would  continue  to  exist  in  future  generations.  It was particularly concerned that widespread discrimination was encouraged by  the  passive  role  adopted  by  Parliament,  employers  and  trade  unions. Moreover, it pointed out that no employer or trade union had established a special department to assist the black worker to overcome disadvantage in employment. 205   This  Committee  had  organised  a  Conference  attended  by over  100  delegates  from  the  Midlands  in  January  1974. A  resolution  was passed  calling  for  an  active  campaign  against  racist  ideology  and  racial discrimination.  Moreover,  it  urged  the  TUC  to  appoint  a  full-time  officer with  responsibility  for  'advising  affiliated  unions  on  all  aspects  of  race relations'. 206

Further, other locally-based committees were set up by trade unionists in  London,  the  Midlands  and  in  the  North  of  England  in  the  1970s  to

combat discrimination and to attempt to change their respective unions and TUC  policy.  In  addition,  Trades  Councils  organised  conferences  and campaigns, expressing concern about racist ideology and racial discrimination within the labour movement and in British society generally. For  example,  the  Black  Coventry  Trades  Council  Conference  of  1974 passed a resolution which called on its members to bring pressure to bear on union district committees to appoint a delegate essentially concerned with 'racialist  problems',  to  initiate  recruiting  campaigns  among  immigrant workers  (using  literature  which  was  printed  in  their  own  languages)  to demand  an  end  to  police  harassment  of  black  workers  and  ensuring  that known  racialists  did  not  hold  trade  union  office.  A  year  later,  in  1975, following  a  trade  union  conference  on  the  problems  of  racialism;  a delegation from Warley Trades Council met local councillors, after which Warley  Council  agreed  that  a  person  of  'immigrant  origin'  should  be employed  to  deal  with  such  matters  as  language,  form  filling  and  other problems relating to the Council, and to make representations to constituency bodies to discuss the repeal of the 'patrial clauses' in the 1971 Immigration Act which were 'racial in intent and effect'. 207

It  is  not  easy  to  assess the meaning or effect of the resolutions passed by,  and  the  actions  of,  these  locally-based  committees  and  conferences  in the early 1970s. Some of the trade unionists who initiated or took part in them  were  members  of  political  organisations  to  the  left  of  the  Labour Party, but far from all participants were politically committed in this way. Nevertheless,  these  forums  indicated  a  current  of  opposition  at  the  local level to the official TUC policy and were able to pose as representing the trade  union  principles  on  racism  and  discrimination  in  their  areas  of influence.

Opposition  to  the  TUC  policy  has  not  been  confined  to  the  floor  of Congress or the grass-roots level. Interviews with trade union officials have revealed  that  many  full-time  officials  tried  to  develop  a  more  positive policy. To them, the many industrial disputes during the early 1970s were evidence of the weakness of TUC policy. But, even if the TUC leadership wanted to, it was hamstrung by its obligation to listen increasingly and act upon  the  dictates  of  its  member  unions  whose  representatives  sat  on  the General Council.

By the mid-1970s, then, the situation within the TUC was one in which certain  trade  union  leaders,  as  a  result  of  particular  events,  were  re-

evaluating TUC policy. Moreover, within the trade union movement there were  a  few  trade  unionists  who  wanted  the  adoption  of  a  more  positive policy by the TUC. And what seemed also necessary was 'a broadening of the concern' in the General Council and the TUC., as a result of the racial abuse and attacks (and increasing public awareness) of the National Front.

Union  officials  interviewed  were  asked  about  the  reasons  for  the  reevaluation of TUC policy and about National Front activity amongst their own  members. All  of  them  said  that  the  Front  was  active  and  had  some support amongst their members. Four of them specifically referred to it as a fascist  organisation;  two  officials  drew  parallels  between  the  NF  and  the rise  of  National  Socialism  in  Germany,  pointing  to  the  current  economic crisis and high level of unemployment. Although two officials also pointed out that the current influence of the National Front should not be overstated, there was concern about its activity and future potential amongst all union officials interviewed. Three of the five officials, including a member of the TUC General Council, also stated that the emergence of the National Front had necessitated a new policy from the TUC. The General Council member, Tom  Jackson,  referred  to  the  'casual  attitude  of  the  TUC  to  the  'race question' prior to 1975', saying that the members of the General Council believed that there was no real cause for concern or felt that they 'did not want to lift the stone'. However, when the NF intervened in 'a big way' by putting  up  a  large  number  of  candidates,  he  and  one  or  two  Council members,  including  Jack  Jones  (TGWU)  and  David  Basnett  (GMWU), made calls for action.

A  further  dimension  to  this  was  that  Jackson  also  claimed  that  the National  Front's  intervention  in  1974  gave  the  Left  in  the  trade  union movement  a  good  reason  to  act  on  the  'race  issue'.  In  presenting  their interpretation to this, Miles and Phizacklea argued that trade unionists who had  wanted  a  more  positive  policy  towards  the  issues  posed  by  black immigrant  workers  have  had  to  contend  with  the  racism  of  white  trade unionists,  but  after  1974  it  became  possible  for  them  to  argue  that  the National  Front  as  a  neo-fascist  party,  was  the  'enemy'  of  the  trade  union movement.  Thus  identifying  the  NF,  they  were  now  prepared  openly  to demand support for a policy of opposition to racialism. Therefore it seemed that the effect of the NF's activities was to force the General Council and the TUC to act in relation to the 'race issue' between 1970 and 1973.

By comparison, little had been done through the combined activities of the internal critics at the annual Congresses and the left-wing organisations and  rank-and-file  trade  union  groupings  over  the  preceding  25  years. Although the latter served to needle the General Council continually with the exception of the motion passed at the 1973 Congress opposing the 1971 Immigration Act, it had no fundamental and decisive impact.

By the end of the 1970s, however, there was no doubt as to the NF's provocative  racist  marches.  The  murder  of  a  young  Asian,  in  1976,  the growing concern over racist policemen at the Grunwick picket lines (and within the black communities) and violence on Blacks in several parts of the country, highlighted the need for anti-racist support in fighting NF-led racism.

## Conclusion

The focus then of TUC action and speeches by General Council members since  1974  had  been  to  combat  racism  and  racialist  practices  within  the white working class. If, however, Maurice Styles was correct in arguing that the  roots  of  racialism  are  buried  deep  in  everyone  and  are  derived  from Britain's  imperial  depredations  then  in  the  absence  of  evidence  to  the contrary,  one  must  doubt  whether  a  propaganda  campaign  lasting  a  few months, and of very uneven intensity, was adequate to the task. Certainly, some of the trade union officials interviewed were cynical about the extent of  the  influence  of  the  campaign  on  shopfloor  practice,  although  all believed that union representatives at all levels were fully aware of union policy and were likely to act in opposition to it.

The  General  Council  had,  by  comparison,  placed  less  emphasis  upon dealing with the material disadvantage  of  black workers.  Instead, it followed  a  two-pronged  policy:  first,  to  press  all  affiliated  unions  to negotiate  acceptance  by  employers,  of  equal  opportunity  clauses  and, secondly, to press both government and the CBI to pursue equal opportunity policies. This strategy achieved little.

Between  1976  and  1979  although  race  relations,  equal  rights,  the Grunwick  dispute  and  racialism  had  consistently  been  on  the  Annual Congress agenda, polarisation between the black and white sections of the British  working  class  had  increased.  The  ASTMS  delegate's  words  in moving  his  motion  on  the  'Select  Committee  on  Race  Relations'  at  the 106th Annual Congress had a particularly hard ring: 'If racialism is to be

checked  and  then  eradicated,  if  black  workers  are  not  to  be  tempted  by separationist  solutions  or  simply  opt  out  of  the  Movement  then  solidarity must be forthcoming. There have been too many instances recently when black workers have had to struggle alone. They must be given the support of the whole trade union movement.' 208

Indeed,  into  the  1980s  with  the  passage  of  the  Nationality  Bill,  that 'support'  was  clearly  not  forthcoming.  Thus,  'separationist  solutions'  and opting  out  of  the  movement  seemed  the  only  alternative  as  the  TUC.,  in desperation, took initiatives to fight rampant racism.

## TUC initiatives: workbook on racism

By the end of 1983, faced with high unemployment and a determination by the  Thatcher  regime  to  crush  the  trade  unions,  the  TUC.,  aware  of  the divisiveness of the government's policies, felt the need to stem the racism among rank-and-file trade unionists. Of course, they had all along known of the racist attacks on black workers both at the workplace and in the black communities. Thus, the TUC took the step (following the earlier TUC Black Workers' Charter) of stating its position in the TUC Workbook on Racism .

No longer could the TUC ignore the evidence of racism which had at last filtered up to the General Council. Given that attacks on black workers has  taken  such  forms  as  verbal  abuse  and  physical  violence,  to  unfair treatment in pay and working conditions, the TUC felt that if these attacks (which came from employers, government and fellow trade unionists) are not opposed, all workers will suffer. Indeed, racism will continue to be used to divide worker against worker. Hence the value of their Workbook to  all trade  unionists.  This  statement  on  racism  was  intended  to  help  build confidence  and  skills  in  four  main  ways:  to  understand  racism  and  its effects  on  working  people;  to  present  the  arguments  against  racism;  to improve organisation to overcome divisions at work and in the union; and to develop bargaining aims to win equality at work. 209

It was hoped that this instructive Workbook (covering such work-related aspects as 'the issues', roots of racism, racism at work, the law and union action, among others) would be used on trade union and TUC courses.

For its part (given that in 1977, 61 per cent of the employed black males belonged to trade unions but only 47 per cent of employed white males), the TUC  posed  the  question:  why  tackle  racism?  After  years  of  Annual Conference  debates,  the  TUC  was  now  able  to  admit  that  because  black

workers experience discrimination it was the unions' job to do something about it. Indeed they could no longer afford to ignore the issues raised by racism  stating:  'Once  trade  unionists  start  picking  and  choosing  between different  groups  of  workers,  segregating  one  from  another,  we  are  on  a slippery slope towards our own destruction.' 210

The TUC pointed out that black workers have been hit harder by the economic  crisis  than  the  majority  of  white  workers  and  reiterated  what earlier reports had found, that the black community experiences high levels of unemployment and are employed in low paid, unskilled work with few or no real  opportunities  for  promotion. And,  remarkably,  the TUC  unlike  its earlier phase of reluctance and ambiguity (to put it mildly) in dealing with race and immigration was now, in response to repeated government attacks, ready to state boldly that the background to these problems lies in Britain's colonial  past  and  the  willingness  of  governments  and  employers  to  see black workers as a source of cheap labour.

Moreover, the TUC admitted (in self-criticism) that trade unionists have also tended to side-step the issues raised by racism because they have often been concerned not to upset white members by challenging racist attitudes. Indeed,  it  was  felt  that  in  the  changing  situation  forced  by  a  recession, racism was most likely to be used to destroy union organisation, particularly at  a  time  when  trade  union  unity  was  most  needed  to  defend  jobs  and services.

## In practice: the disillusionment of black workers (alternative organisations)

In  spite  of  the  TUC's  directives,  black  workers  were  (and  are)  wholly dissatisfied. In effect, no real progress was made. After the miners' strike in the  early  1970s  dealt  the  Conservative  government  a  crushing  blow  and inflation  rose  rapidly,  wage  restraint  in  the  form  of  a  'Social  Contract' became the Labour government's policy. At the back of the pay queue were black workers, women  and  pensioners. By 1973, there was strong resentment and disillusionment among black workers. In their relationship with, and experience of, the trade unions, two basic questions were asked: Are the British trade unions in their relations with black workers 'too much part of the problem to be any part of the solution?' Or should black workers,

whatever  their  criticisms  of  the  unions,  act  in  the  belief  that  there  is  no prospect  for  success  if  they  wage  their  fight  for  justice  outside  the  union structure? Of the 24 million people at work in Britain it was estimated that only 9 million belonged to a trade union. 211 When asked what their policy and practice on race relations was some of the major unions' answers varied widely. Although the NUR, NUPE, USDAW, TGWU, ASLEF, GMWU and the AEUW were opposed to racism, few of them signed the 'TRJ' letter to The Times ,  and more importantly, none of them (certainly during the early 1970s) had black full-time officials. Furthermore, the GMWU felt that 'race relations are another dimension of industrial activity and that the problems of  black  workers  are  those  of  workers  in  general'.  Therefore  they  were opposed to any organisation that set itself up in opposition to the official trade  union  movement.  More  specifically,  they  felt  the  idea  of  a  black caucus within the trade union movement should be viewed with suspicion. Apart from three black trade unionists (Bill Morris, National Secretary of the Transport and General Passenger Transport Group, Robert Walker, the first  West  Indian  to  be  elected  to  the  posts  of  Branch  Secretary  and Chairman  of  a  group  within  ASLEF,  and  the  author  who  was  the  first secretary of the Whitley Council elected from the trade union side when the British Library was formed in 1973), the odds were clearly stacked against black trade unionists achieving positions of prominence within their unions. The democratic principle of majority rule militated against it. Not surprisingly,  there  was  deep  disillusionment  with  the  quality  of  black workers' representation in the trades union movement. As one commentator put  it:  'There  is  a  cold,  hard  logic  in  the  unions'  democratically  proper refusal to let the interests of a minority override those of the majority. But this short-sighted easy option has contributed much to the deeply ingrained, seemingly insoluble problems of today.' 212

When  at  the  height  of  their  wealth  and  power  during  the  1950s  and 1960s the  unions  had  enormous  potential  for  effecting  radical  change  for the benefit of Britain's working class as a whole, they failed to accept the challenge on behalf of their black members. While it was understandable, it was nonetheless unforgiveable.

Capitalism and curbs on discrimination

Concern  for  the  ending  of  racial  discrimination  at  work  is  not  always disinterested argued Ian Macdonald, 'sometimes the motive is simply profit, or  a  desire  to  buy  social  peace  at  the  expense  of  justice'. 213 Indeed,  the recent strikes of black workers sounded a warning that they were no longer prepared to tolerate the discrimination practised against them in the form of low wages, bad working conditions and no promotion opportunities. They could not be left to form separate organisations. Macdonald concludes, 'It is their  action  which has created liberal sentiment among important sections of industry, trade unions and government, and has forced them to develop further strategies for dealing with discrimination. It has also, I suggest, been responsible for the wave of liberal sentiment over the deportation of illegal immigrants and the calls for an amnesty.' 214

Yet in spite of the liberal slogan 'White labour can't be free while black labour is in chains', the black working class has remained firmly shackled under  the  pressure  exerted  from  all  sides  within  the  British  capitalist system.

## The black workers' response

In spite of the real problems they face, some militant black trade unionists have concentrated on workplace oriented organisations. Forging links with black fellow workers had become a necessity. To wage their own struggle (given  the  trade  unions'  racism  and  backpedalling  tactics)  black  workers formed  their  own  combinations.  For  example,  the  Black  Workers  Coordinating  Committee,  Black  Unity  and  Freedom  Party  and  the  Croydon Collective.

Links were indeed forged with the Black Workers' Alliance in an effort to  agitate  and  struggle  against  racism  at  all  levels.  It  was  argued  that  the alliance must incorporate those organisations in our black communities that are equipped to participate in the struggle at the highest level. Together they must strive to develop the right political ideology among the black working class, so that it can be applied to black workers' problems, and subsequently arrive at the right conclusions and the right tactical methods with which to tackle  the  stranglehold  of  state-instituted  poverty  and  oppression.  It  was therefore necessary to understand the methods of the race-ridden capitalist state machinery, as all forms of oppression are interrelated.

Finally, it was argued that the only alternative was the seizing of state power by the working class and the establishment of scientific socialism, not only on a national level but internationally. Their recommendations to the Conference on Trade Unions and Racism were:

- 1. The formation of a Black Workers' Alliance to co-ordinate our struggle with the trade union movement.
- 2. The re-introduction of the periodical issuing leaflets that point out to workers the importance of a trade union that truly represents the interests of workers.
- 3. For  the  Black  Workers'  Alliance  to  help  black  workers  outside  the  organised  industrial framework to organise themselves in protection of their interests.
- 4. To take the Black people's case, in relation to racism, as one of priority.
- 5. The Alliance must further develop the working class ideology of revolutionary and scientific socialism amongst all workers especially black workers.

(FORMULATED  BY:  Black  Workers  Co-ordinating  Committee  (BWCC),  Black  Unity  and Freedom Party (BUFP) and Croydon Collective.) 215

One is reminded of what Vic Feather (a former General Secretary of the TUC)  said  in  the  Westminster  Trinity  Lecture  in  1970:  'The  trade  union movement is concerned with a man or a woman as a worker. The colour of a man's skin has no relevance whatever to his work.' 216  If only this were true!

Another  black  workers'  organisation,  the  'Black  Workers'  Movement' distributed a paper at the Conference on Trade unions and Racism called by the Mansfield Hosiery Strike Committee.  The  Movement  posed  the question: How can we translate our experience into unity of the whole black working class to make our demands?' In answer, it stated,

Our experience has indicated the forms of strategy around which we can organise to make our demands.

- 1. Mobilising the strength of the whole black class in the community and in the factory
- 2. Seeking to talk directly to the white workers and demanding they support our struggles (as we give ours) in their own class interest. But refusing to concede to racist hostility if they refuse.
- 3. Internationalising our struggle wherever possible. 217

The  aim  was  to  show  how  black  workers  organising  themselves  can bridge the gap between the fight in industry and the struggle of communities.  It  is  this  diversion  that  black  workers  have  brought  to  the working class movement in Britain.

The  Black  Workers'  Movement  (BWM)  believed  that  in  order  to formulate  demands  within  industry,  black  workers  needed  a  coordinating front  which  could  be  called  'Black Workers Against  Racism  in  Industry'. The BWM pointed out that this was not a call for a new black organisation. Indeed,  the  struggle  in  Britain  had  given  birth  to  many  such  groups, including the Black Peoples' National Action Collective of which the BWM was a part. The primary task was to document a thorough investigation into the situation of black workers firstly, in industry generally, and secondly, in the trade unions. Out of this investigation, demands were to be made on the government,  on  their  unions  and  on  employers.  Moreover,  they  believed that such an investigation must deal with apprenticeships, a minimum wage for  all  workers,  employed  and  unemployed,  equal  pay  for  all,  including equal pay for women workers inside the home and in the factory, an end to classification  of  skills,  and  the  effects  of  the  Immigration  Act  on  black workers.

Finally the BWM believed that the platform of demands that emerged must speak for the needs of the whole black working class. They believed that within the black community there was ample experience and willingness to make a front of Black Workers Against Racism in Industry a serious political force for unity and struggle within the black working class.

The organisation called the Black People's Freedom Movement (and the BWM)  both  belonged  to  the  Black  Peoples'  National  Action  Collective. Their  statements  do  not  differ  greatly  in  analysis.  However,  under  the heading  'Mobilising  Our  Community'  the  BPFM  made  the  following demands:

pressure should be put on unions to recognise racism, as opposed to sweeping it under the carpet. Steps should be taken by the unions to see  that  black  workers  have  the  same  rights  as  white  ones. Black caucuses .  We  see  the  formation  of  black  caucuses,  especially  in subsidiaries  of  the  same  firm,  as  a  necessity.  Black  workers  must recognise  the  failings  of  the  trade  unions  and  seek  to  be  selfsufficient within them - organising and creating conditions whereby they ally themselves to the white progressive workers to make the necessary demands. Moreover, it was necessary to forge links with our fellow workers, wherever they may be employed with the aim of forming a broad politically-based 'Black Workers' Alliance', which

would ally itself with the just struggle of black working class people everywhere.  218

Furthermore, the IWA Southall declared that the trade unions were the only avenues open to black workers through which they can fight against racial  prejudice. They did not dispute the fact that there was considerable racial discrimination even in the trade union movement but felt it was the duty  of  the  leaders  of  the  trade  unions  to  inform  the  members  of  their unions  about  the  sinister  policies  of  the  ruling  classes  to  divide  and  rule. Conscious  of  their  own  disunity,  they  commented  that  the  'present  split' was only beneficial to the bosses who could exploit it for their own ends. Moreover  they  argued  that  'by  active  participation  of  the  immigrant community  in  the  Trade  Union  Movement  we  can  reduce  the  prevailing racial  prejudice among the workers. Finally, Trade Unions should employ more  full  time  immigrant  officials  in  order  to  win  the  confidence  of  the immigrant community.' 219

These were the themes being emphasised by the leading black organisations.  Although  they  were  disenchanted  with  the  white  trade unions,  towards  the  end  of  the  1970s  the  immediacy  of  black  workers' problems,  in  spite  of  Sivanandan's  call,  'Put  Politics  in  Command'  drew them closer to the workplace where at the end of the day, it really mattered.

In December 1981, a group of black trade union activists (Asians and West  Indians)  founded  the  Black  Trade  Unionists  Solidarity  Movement. They  came  together  'to  begin  a  united  movement  of  all  black  people  in Britain,  to  pressurise  the  existing  institutions,  and  fight  for  our  rights'. Membership was open to people of Asian, African and Caribbean descent, employed  or  unemployed.  The  BTUSM  founders  declared  that  as  Black Trade  Unionists  they  were  concerned  at  the  extent  of  racism  in  British society and particularly in the trades unions and labour movement.

The disturbances in Brixton, Southall and other parts of London showed that  black  people  are  no  longer  prepared  to  accept  unemployment,  bad housing,  police  provocation  and  the  institutional  and  individual  racism inherent in British society.

BTUSM was strongly opposed to continuing political trends in the area of  race  relations,  e.g.  the  Nationality  Bill,  the  Circular  issued  by  the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) on overseas patients, the refusal of the DHSS to pay benefits to people who do not speak English,

passport checks and immigration 'fishing raids', and calls for the repatriation  of  Blacks,  among  others. These  measures,  they  argued  are  an exacerbation of previous racist policies and practices.

As  trade  unionists,  they  felt  the  day-to-day  racism  at  the  workplace must be of primary concern. Moreover, they were aware that unemployment, short time working, redundancy and other forms of direct and indirect discrimination affect black people more than any other section within  British  society.  Indeed,  their  duty  was  to  organise  black  workers within the trade unions and labour movement to combat racism in such a way that they could promote and protect the interests of black people in the trade unions and labour movement.

Thus  they  pledged  themselves  to:  firstly,  organise  a  London-based Conference  of  Black  Trade  Unionists  to  discuss  a  programme  of  action; secondly, make links with other black workers' organisations with a view to launching a National Black Trade Unionists Solidarity Movement; thirdly, work to improve the increasing participation  of  black  people  at  all  levels within  the  trade  unions  and  labour  movement  and,  fourthly,  to  work  for changes  within  the  trade  union  and  labour  movement  to  restore  the confidence of black people. 220

In  its  first  factsheet  issued  at  the  price  of  10p,  the  focus  was  on  such articles  as  'We Are  Our  Own  Liberators',  'Racism  in  NALGO  Exposed', and 'Why We Need BTUSM?'. Furthermore, under the heading 'Norman Tebbit  Rides  on  Grunwick's  Grave'  it  was  argued  that  the  foundation  for Tebbitt's  anti-union  laws  can  be  traced  back  to  the  unheeded  lessons  of Grunwick. The BTUSM  writers criticised the present Consevative government which was reaping the benefit of the TUC's lack of courage in not going the whole way. They argued that the TUC's lack of leadership in opposing  secondary  picketing  and  the  closed  shop,  for  example,  allowed Tebbitt  to  tighten  the  noose  round  the  trade  unions.  Disillusionment, widespread among black workers, was increasingly being channelled into organisation and action. Moreover, the factsheet quoted Mrs Jayaben Desai who,  having  started  a  hunger  strike  outside  Congress  House,  said  to  Len Murray, TUC General Secretary, 'I will not remove my hunger strike from your  doorstep.  The  problem  is  you,  and  I  want  to  expose  you  to  the world.' 221

After  several  months  of  advertising  its  aims  and  objectives,  BTUSM called  its  first  Conference,  in  accordance  with  its  first  pledge,  which  was held  on  4-5  June  1983  at  County  Hall,  London.  Notably,  the  Conference organisers had made arrangements for the accommodation of the disabled among the delegates and guests, and facilities for those with children. This Conference was a decisive move by black trade unionists; disenchantment and anger had given way to organisation and putting together a programme of  action.  Significantly,  BTUSM  has  made  it  abundantly  clear  that  they would work for changes within the trade union movement.

The interesting thing about this development is that many militant black trade  unionists  see  clearly  the  link  between  their  workplace  struggle  and their community struggle. Thus, they have clearly stated their intention to organise and work within the trade union movement. In other words, they want white workers to recognise and act on the real, day-to-day problems of racism  and  sexism,  so  that  together  they  can  work  effectively.  So  far however, the black initiative has met with only marginal response. Historically,  the  vast  majority  of  trade  unionists  have  been  complacent about  black  workers  and  slow  to  act.  The  annual  reports  of  the  Trades Union Congress confirm this.

## From Pan Africanism to Black Power

Over  a  long  period  stretching  back  to  the  late  eighteenth  century,  a  few members of the small black community in Britain had initiated and, with the sympathy and co-operation of indigenous liberals and radicals, gradually developed an ideology on which to build its organisations in the face of racism and overt hostility in an alien land - the home of their rulers.

The departure of the radical Pan African leaders from Britain, following the Fifth Pan African Congress, to lead the nationalist movements in Africa and the West Indies, left a vacuum of black militant leadership, in Britain, during the 1950s and for most of the 1960s.

In  the  main,  apart  from  Claudia  Jones  and Amanyu  Manchanda,  such leadership as there was  during  these  decades,  was  middle-class  and conservative. Not only did this contrast sharply to the radical Pan Africanists, it essentially misled black migrants, at least for the first decade and  a  half,  into  believing  that  multi-racial  organisation  and  integrationist arguments were the best means for improving their disadvantaged positions.

In short, as the black migrant's status as 'second-class' citizens deteriorated (and the prospects for their children appeared particularly depressing) they sought a way out of their dilemma.

Unlike  the  Pan  Africanists,  potential  and  actual  black  leaders  had  to wrestle with the problems of a permanent and growing black community. Indeed  (as  racial  discrimination  ran  'riot')  such  leaders  faced  the  task  of confronting  the  racists,  the  fascists,  the  trade  unions  and  government,  or settle for going through the motions of leadership and do nothing about the root of the problem: white racism. Although some were willing to delude themselves,  others had  no  illusions: they were  acutely conscious  of representing a minority in a racist society, and the oppression and suffering emanating from the depredations of individual and institutionalised racism.

Nonetheless,  many  attempts  to  organise  and  integrate  black  migrants were made, but time and again, they were refused entry into many areas of British  social  life.  Increasingly,  they  paid  attention  to  the  decaying  inner city  environment,  as  they  witnessed  on  television  screens  and  read  in  the newspapers of a different historical, but parallel experience of Blacks in the inner  city  ghettoes  of  the  United  States  of  America.  Black  nationalism, which  the  Pan  Africanists  had  preached  to  end  colonialism  abroad,  had evolved  into  Black  Power,  a  cry  from  the  'colonised' American  ghettoes, which had strong echoes among Blacks in Britain by the close of the 1960s. Black  Power  and  black  autonomy  were  increasingly  being  applied  to  the struggle of the black community 'colonised' in the metropole.

Generally,  black  organisations  from  1950  to  1984  can  be  divided  into two periods. Firstly,  between 1950 and the mid-1960s, they were tolerant and accommodationist, reflecting to a large extent, their leaders' attitudes; and  secondly,  from  the  mid-1960s,  the  'wind  of  change'  had  introduced greater  militancy  as  reflected  in  the  industrial  struggles  (resulting  in  the formation  of  strike  committees,  for  example)  and  community-oriented social and cultural organisations created to fight racism and fascism during the 1970s and 1980s. In fact racism had reached a disturbing level during the 1970s and 1980s, as the black community mounted many campaigns in response to repeated attacks by racists and fascists. As it was, 1980 saw the return  to  Britain  of  the  extraordinary  radical  Pan  Africanist  and  Marxist historian, C. L. R. James. To commemorate his eightieth birthday he gave a series of lectures. Since 1938 he had been one of the chief black advocates of  autonomous  organisation.  Soon  after  these  lectures,  many  of  James's

writings  were  republished,  including  his  famous  book Black  Jacobins .  A new militant readership was now able to either re-read or be initiated into Jamesiana.  As  it was, the very year that he delivered his lectures, 'spontaneous crowd violence' erupted in Bristol. This change from 'integrationist' to greater emphasis on 'independent' black organisation can be directly related to the acceptance of Black Power by Britain's enlarged post-war black community.

## The ideology of Black Power: 'from Black Power back to Pan Africanism'

Gold Coast Independence in 1957 was the first example of 'Black Power' in Africa. This was an example of the black man's right and ability to govern himself. In effect, he was, at least politically, free of foreign occupation.

When  Kwame  Nkrumah  (the  first  Black  African  Prime  Minister) assumed the leadership of the Gold Coast, black Americans, 'colonised' for some 400 years, took note. Pan Africanism had brought organisation in the black colonies and Black Power in the United States. Indeed, the foremost Black  Power  advocate  by  the  mid-1960s,  Stokely  Carmichael  (who  was born under the British colonial system in Trinidad), had caught the essence of  a  two-way  flow  of  ideas  and  identity  when  he  wrote  in  1965, Black Power Back to Pan Africanism .

Marcus Garvey who had taught the black man to see 'beauty in himself had  been  in  contact  with  many  Pan  Africanists,  although  there  were differences  between  them. The  phenomenal  growth  in  membership  of  his Universal Negro Improvement Association in the United States spread the idea  and  real  possibility  of  this  'Black  Moses'  leading  oppressed  black people out of American back to their African fatherland. This vision struck deep responses among his disciples. One such disciple was Earl Little, the father of Malcolm X. Little's black radicalism led to him being lynched by white  racists. 1 Malcolm  could  not  and  did  not  want  to  forget  his  father's commitment  and  the  manner  of  his  death.  In  turn,  he  also  committed himself to the cause of Blacks in America by joining the Black Muslims. His forceful messages of black separation and black autonomy exceeded the limits imposed by the black Muslims' leader Elijah Muhammad. Differences  of  opinion  led  to  Malcolm  X's  suspension.  Nonetheless  he continued to preach black separation.  Later, in 1965, he was shot dead. 2

By  the  time  of  his  death,  he  had  become  a  figure  of  national  and international importance. His passing, which raised a number of questions, stunned thousands of black people and created a vacuum of black militant leadership. Urban deprivation, in terms of unemployment, housing, education and welfare, to some extent, reflected parallels in British cities. Clearly, radicalism was most appealing in these circumstances.

In 1966, after the famous Meredith Mississippi March, Stokely Carmichael  and  the  concept  of  Black  Power  (as  we  understand  it  today) affected the lives of thousands of black people throughout the United States. In  line  with  the  black  leaders  who  had  preceded  him,  he  too  was  most conscious of Africa. On the subject of 'Power and Racism' he wrote: 'This is  one  reason Africa  has  such  importance:  the  reality  of  black  men  ruling their  own nations gives blacks elsewhere a sense of possibility, of power, which they do not now have.' 3

Between 1965 and 1971, a crucial period for black struggle, both in the United States and in Britain, Carmichael's articles and speeches record his consistent growth and development as a revolutionary activist and theoretician. He saw the civil rights movement of Dr Martin Luther King as a sort of 'buffer zone' between the liberal Whites and angry young Blacks. Predictably, the words Black Power were met with decided white hostility. Conscious  of  this,  Carmichael  explained  that  an  organisation  such  as  the Student  Nonviolent  Co-ordinating  Committee  which  claimed  to  speak  for the needs of a community must speak in the tone of that community, not as somebody else's buffer zone. This is the significance of Black Power as a slogan, he argued. Applying this to the situation in Britain, how right he was about  the  crop  of  accommodationist  black  leaders  at  that  time.  He  added that such  an  organisation  as  the  SNCC  'must  work  to  provide  that community with a position of strength from which to make its voice heard. This is the significance of Black Power beyond the slogan.' 4

Carmichael felt that the economic foundations of the United States had to be shaken if black people were to take control of their lives. He had no doubt that the colonies, 'the black ghettoes' in the United States, had to be liberated. For racism to die, a totally different America must be born.

On the question of integration, Carmichael said that 'integration speaks not at all to the problem of poverty - only to the problem of blackness'. 5 Recognising  his  radical  responses,  he  stated  that  the  reconstruction  of

American society, 'if at all possible, is basically the responsibility of whites -  not  blacks'. 6 He  saw  as  one  of  the  major  tasks  of  Black  Power,  the necessity of reclaiming black history and black identity from the 'cultural terrorism and depredation of self-justifying white guilt'. 7

Moreover,  he  was  careful  to  emphasise  the  concept  of  independent organisation  within  the  Black  Power  programme.  For  it  is  only  when  the black community is able to control local offices, and negotiate with other groups  from  a  position  of  strength  that  the  possibility  of  meaningful political alliances on specific issues will be increased.  He warned that the 8 'inner city' in most urban areas was already predominantly 'Negro' and that these areas

can become concentration camps with a bitter and volatile population, whose only power is the power to destroy, or organised and powerful communities able to make constructive contributions to the total society. Without the power to control their lives and their communities, without effective political  institutions  through  which to  relate  to  the  total  society,  these  communities  will  exist  in  a constant state of insurrection. This is a choice that the country will have to make. 9

Speaking to students at Berkeley in 1966, Carmichael said, 'What we have  in  SNCC  is  anti-racist  racism.  We  are  against  racists.  If  everybody who's white sees himself as racist and sees us against him, he's speaking from his own guilt.' 10 And at Morgan State College he said the trouble with black students is that they do not read enough. 'If we could get books like we could boogaloo we would be uptight.' 11  Later in his speech he said only by eradicating the cause could rebellion be stopped. 'It is time for you to stop  running  away  from  being  black',  he  said,  and  urged  the  college students, to think, to begin to understand that, 'as the growing intellectuals, the black intellectuals in this country, must begin to define beauty for black people.' 12 He  was  re-stating  Garvey's  message.  Further,  he  criticised 'individualism' as being unviable; indeed, it was time to think as a people and as a group and work towards the advance of that group.

Speaking on the Dialectics of Liberation in London on 18 July 1967, he said he had 'something against England' because of all the rot he read as a

young  man  about  how  good  England  was  to  Trinidad.  He  expressed amazement to read that England had decided to give independence to the West  Indies.  'You  cannot  grant  anybody  independence',  he  argued,  'they just  take  it;  and  that  is  what  white  America  is  going  to  learn.  No  white liberal can give me anything. The only thing a white liberal can do for me is to help civilise the whites, because they need to be civilised.' 13 Moreover, he argued, given that capitalism and racism 'go hand in hand' it is necessary to  understand that the SNCC's analysis of United States and international capitalism begins in race. Indeed colour and culture were, and are, the key to black oppression; therefore the SNCC's historical and economic analysis is necessarily rooted in these concepts.

He also argued that the glorious American Constitution guaranteed 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness', for white men only. In fact, the black person was counted only as three-fifths of  a  person. The enslavement and colonisation of black people abroad and in the United States had laid the base and framework of institutionalised racism in America. Thus the cheap labour of Third World workers benefit the American working class. Given the double-exploitation of black people at home and abroad, the SNCC was committed to increase the revolutionary consciousness of black people in America to join with the Third World. 'We are fighting a political warfare', said  Carmichael.  'Politics  is  war  without  violence.  War  is  politics  with violence.' 14 He was careful to point out that Black Power must be seen (and understood by Blacks) as a part of a new force, sometimes called the Third World. Thus, the black struggle in the United States was closely related to the  liberation  struggles  around  the  world.  He  pointed  to  the  fact  that American cities (and indeed British cities) are populated by people from the Third  World.  Although  these  cities  were  the  heart  of  commercial  trade, black people who lived there had no control over their resources. In fact, they did not control the land, the houses, or the stores. All these were owned by  Whites  who  lived  outside  the  community.  Thus,  the  cry  of  rebellions since  1966  has  been  Black  Power;  a  cry  rooted  in  an  ideology  which  the masses identify with instinctively. Because Blacks are powerless, they are oppressed. In effect, Black Power was an attack on racism and exploitation.

Carmichael argued that because colour has been used to oppress black people, they must now use colour (as other people have used nationality) as a  weapon  of  liberation.  But,  he  warned,  even  if  racism  was  destroyed,

exploitation would not necessarily mean the end of racism. They must both be destroyed. 15

In  a  speech  given  at  the  birthday  benefit  party  for  Brother  Huey  P. Newton (Minister of Defence of the Black Panther Party for Self Defence) in  Oakland  California,  on  7  February  1968,  Carmichael  said  it  was  most important to understand that 'for black people the question of community is not a question of geography, it is a question of colour. … We have brothers in Latin America, we have brothers all over the world. And once we begin to  understand  that  the  concept  of  'community'  is  simply  one  of  'our people', it makes no difference where we are - we are with our people and therefore we are home.' He also pointed out that while poor Whites have their culture, their values and their institutions, 'ours have been completely destroyed'.  Therefore,  it  was  necessary  for  Blacks  in  America  to  form alliances with people who are trying to rebuild their culture, history, dignity and honour. 16

Further,  he  focused  on  the  ideologies  of  Communism  and  socialism which concerned the class structure and its endemic oppression. He pointed out that much more than exploitation was at stake. Indeed Blacks were the victims of racism. And underlining Padmore's argument, he felt, given their 'present form', neither Communism nor socialism spoke to the problem of racism.  He  elaborated:  'If  you  were  exploited  by  other  black  people,  it would be a question of how we divide the profits. It is not that for us. It is a question of how we regain our humanity and begin to live as a people. We do  not  do  that  because  of  the  effects  of  racism  in  this  country.  We  must therefore consciously strive for an ideology which deals with racism first, and if we do that we recognize the necessity of hooking up with the 900 million black people in the world today.' 17

Again, he reminded his audience (including Rap Brown, Jim Forman, Chico Neblett, Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver, Alprentice Carter and Ron Williams) of the black diaspora, and that the Black Power struggle was an international  political  struggle  not  a  national  one.  He  said  the  world  was heading for a 'colour clash' and the only means of survival for the black community was by organising them and orienting them towards an African ideology that speaks 'to our blackness - nothing else.' 18 Thus, black youth must be organised with a revolutionary prospectus, stating that Blacks were fighting a war of liberation.

But  to  do  so,  an  ideology  of  nationalism  was  necessary. Although  he specified  that  black  nationalism  'must  be  our  ideology',  he  argued  that while blackness was necessary, it was not sufficient. Therefore, there must be a conscious move to organise the black communities. 19

In  true  revolutionary  fashion,  Carmichael  stated  in  'The  Pitfalls  of Liberalism':

So whether the liberal likes it or not, he finds himself being lumped, by the oppressed, with the oppressor - of course he is part of that group.  The  final  confrontation,  when  it  does  come  about,  will  of course include the liberal on the side of the oppressor. Therefore if the oppressed really wants a revolutionary change, he has no choice but to rid himself of those liberals in his rank. 20

Carmichael had left the United States, taking the Black Power message far  and  wide. At  the  opening  of  the  Malcolm  X  Liberation  University  in October 1969, his 'Message from Guinea' was delivered, in his absence, by Howard  Fuller.  He  regarded  the  MXLU  as  'one  of  the  most  fruitful  and promising institutions' in the United States and fully supported the underlying concepts that had guided and directed such efforts. Ultimately, he felt that all African people must work toward the unification of Africa in other words, the concept of Pan Africanism. 21

From Africa, he reflected on the ten years of struggle from civil rights to Black  Power,  such  as  sit-ins,  freedom  rides,  freedom  schools,  freedom organisations and community control just to develop political consciousness in black people and to point up the contradictions in American society.

For Carmichael 'Back to Africa' was not to be 'just a dream' but 'it will be  a  reality'.  Indeed  for  him  this  became  true.  He  now  lives  in  Africa. Having  formed  the  first  Black  Panther  Party  in  1965,  and  later  resigned, Carmichael had learned the lesson of the study of history from Malcolm X, of  confrontation,  and  the  mobilisation  of  the  masses  taught  by  Dr  Martin Luther King. In April 1970 he reminded his audience in Atlanta, Georgia, that when Malcolm X got 'offed', 'we did nothing'. But when Dr King was 'offed', 'we tore up the country'. This change he interpreted as an historical development  of  the  people;  from  inaction  to  confrontation  and  armed

struggle. 22 What  was  vitally  important  in  bringing  black  people  together was a common ideology.

Carmichael  was  aware  that  although  many  people  had  accepted  the slogan Black Power there were others who 'tried to make it mean what they want it to mean'. Further, he argued that the highest political expression of Black Power is Pan Africanism. In effect 'Black Power meant that all Black people should come together, organise themselves and form a power base to fight for their liberation. That's Black Power.' For Carmichael then, since it was necessary to have a land base in a revolution, black people must move logically to Pan Africanism. 23

Given Lenin's view that imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism and Nkrumah's view that neo-colonialism is the last stage of imperialism, Carmichael  regarded  Nkrumahism  as  the  'highest  political  expression  of Pan Africanism'. Finally,  Carmichael argued in 'Back to Pan Africanism' that  although  advocates  of  Pan  Africanism  have  assured  Africans  in  the diaspora that Pan Africanism does not mean returning to Africa, 'I refuse to do so.' 24

Given  the  conditions  (social,  political  and  economic  problems)  that create  dynamite  to  set  ablaze  the  ghettoes  of American  cities,  the  goal  of black  self-determination  and  black  self-identity  -  Black  Power  -  is  full participation  in  the  decision-making  process  affecting  the  lives  of  black people. In searching for 'New Forms' Carmichael regarded a political party that sought only to 'manage conflict' as being hopelessly inadequate to the needs of a growing body of alienated black people. Uppermost in his mind, at that time, was an educational system which crippled, each year, hundreds of thousands of black children. New mechanisms of control and management  were  urgently  necessary.  In  fact,  it  was  clear  to  the  Black Power advocates that the initiative for such changes could only come from the  black  community.  Carmichael  argued  that  black  people  should  not expect white Americans to move forcefully on these problems, unless and until black Americans begin to move.

In  effect,  this  meant  that  black  people  had  to  organise  themselves  in new  ways  because  the  traditional  approaches  had  failed.  Black  Power would not be realised until black people organised independently to exert power; they should concentrate on forming independent political parties and not waste time trying to reform or convert the racist parties. Moreover, he

emphasised  that  black  visibility  (token  Blacks  in  office)  was  not  Black Power.

Overall  then,  what  was  necessary  was  a  new  consciousness  among black people. Growing  disillusionment in the American  government, particularly among educated Blacks in the inner cities bred a new militancy.

## Liverpool: 'Negro' associations

## The 'Negro' settlement in 1952

The estimated 'Negro' population in Liverpool of 4000-5000 in 1919 had increased to 5550 adult male 'Negroes' by 1950. 25 Although the Chinese, Indians, Arabs and Malays were not included in this estimate, they made up a large proportion of the total non-European population.

Since there were no reliable figures available concerning the volume of African migration during 1951 and 1952, it must be admitted that no one really knew how many 'Negroes' lived in Liverpool at this time. However, in 1952-3 the numbers of 'colonials' were 'unlikely to be greatly in excess of 1500'. 26

This section of the black population settled in a district near the south end docks, the 'coloured quarter', from which one could walk to the docks in about half an hour. Adjacent to this quarter was a settlement of Chinese. Arabs  and  Indians  lived  interspersed  among  the  'Negroes',  but  tended  to congregate closer to the docks.

This typical urban 'slum' close to the commercial and business centres and in a zone of deteriorating houses, attracted seamen of all races. They arrived  at  the  port  with  food,  margarine  and  'ganja',  and  engaged  in  an illicit  trade  which  gave  the  district  a  shady  reputation  in  the  public  mind. While  the  great  majority  of  the  white  and  coloured  residents  had  no connection with these rackets, one 'Negro' complained, 'we all get classed together'.  Nevertheless,  the  alarming  rate  of  anti-social  behaviour  was attributed to high rates of unemployment and sub-standard living conditions which  had  existed  in  the  district  for  a  very  long  time.  Thus,  the  'Negro' colony  or  the  'coloured  quarter'  possessed  a  distinct  identity  of  its  own, generally recognised by both Whites and Blacks.

The 'Negro' population's  position  in  the  economic  life  of  Merseyside can  be  best  seen  by  comparing  its  occupational  distribution  with  that  of Merseyside  as  a  whole.  In  the  following  categories,  the  percentages  for coloured workers and the populations as a whole are set out respectively: professional  and  administrative,  1  and  2  per  cent;  intermediate  (owners, managers, professionals), 6 and 13 per cent; skilled workers, 18 and 52 per cent; and semi-skilled and unskilled workers, 75 and 33 per cent. 27

'Negroes' were therefore largely engaged in unskilled work, while the majority  of  Whites  were  employed  in  some  skilled  occupation.  This concentration of black workers at the bottom of the economic scale 'must have  been  greater  before  the  last  war  brought  numbers  of  skilled  black workers  into  Merseyside'.  Moreover,  according  to  Maddox,  the  Anglocoloured were also mainly engaged in semi-skilled and unskilled work. A few 'Negroes', however, were clerks in public transport, particularly on the railway;  a  number  of  women  did  clerical  work  for  Littlewoods  Football Pool  Company  and  a  few  were  nurses. 28 D.  R.  Manley,  who  was  in Liverpool in 1952 said, as far as he knew there were 'no Negroes employed in  secretarial  work, no shop assistants and no professional people such as lawyers, doctors, teachers or accountants', although Maddox mentioned one doctor.

The exceptional cases were a number of 'Negroes' who owned property in  the  form  of  houses.  Some  of  these  property-owners  ran  'shebeens'. Nevertheless,  most  Blacks  lived  in  cramped  conditions,  impoverished. Unemployment and general deprivation led to dope-peddling in marijuana and prostitution. On  the whole, the West Indian and West  African immigrants, as wage earners, were concentrated at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale.

## Unemployment

Although it was difficult to estimate the rate of unemployment among the Liverpool 'Negro' population (and even more so in the case of the Africans since even less is known about immigration from Africa than was known about  the  inflow  from  the  Caribbean)  if  one  assumed  that  the  1953  adult population was approximately 1500, about 15 per cent was unemployed. If, however,  the  population  had  remained  stationary  since  the  1951  Census, then the rate would be about 41 per cent. It was suggested that unemployment  among  Africans  'may  be  even  higher  than  among  West

Indians'.  Furthermore,  unemployment  rates  appeared  to  be  lower  among black women than among black men. In July 1953, for example, there were no  unemployed  'Anglo  coloured'  women  in  contrast  to  31  men.  It  must however be borne  in  mind  that  not  all  West  Indian  women  were  seeking work;  some  were  students  or  housewives,  while  others  managed  their husbands' lodging houses.

The large difference between the figures for Anglo-coloured males and females  suggested  very  powerfully  the  differences  in  the  employment opportunities between the two sexes. Most of the 'coloured' women were employed  in  Littlewoods  Pools,  in  the  Dunlop  Rubber  factory  and  in clothing  factories.  This  sex  difference  was  attributed  to  the  structure  of Liverpool's economy, in which there were 'greater employment opportunities for girls than boys'. It was also, in part, due to the fact that immigrant women encountered less resistance than did the men. 29

The  greater  unemployment  among  'Negroes'  than  among  Whites  was due  to  the  former's  lack  of  skill  and  to  discrimination  against  them.  The socio-economic  position  of  the  'Negro'  group  was,  therefore,  one  of  low status, relatively little skill and high unemployment.

## Sub-groups within the 'Negro' population: regional and tribal groups

Within the 'Negro' population there were many sub-divisions. Yet the white attitude to this population was to treat all 'Negro' groups in more or less the same  way.  Needless  to  say,  this  had  important  influences  upon  'Negro' social organisation. The 'Negro' population was extremely heterogeneous in cultural background. The Census showed three main groups: West African, West  Indian  and  locally-born  Anglo-coloured.  There  was  also  a  much smaller group of East African Somalis.

The West African migrants from all four British West African territories could be further subdivided into a number of tribal sub-groups, such as Tiv, Ibo,  Ijaw, Yoruba,  Ga,  Ewo,  Fanti, Asante,  Kru,  Mende  and  a  number  of Freetown  creoles  amongst  others.  This  West  African  community  was therefore composed of a large number of small, distinct ethnic sub-groups loosely linked by racial feeling.

On the other hand, the West Indian group was composed of immigrants from various territories in the British Caribbean with Jamaicans forming the largest single  group.  Finally,  the  Anglo-coloureds  were  originally  the

offspring of 'Negro' migrants and local white women. In 1952 there, was a fairly  large  adult  population  of  locally-born  'coloured'  people  who  intermarried among themselves. The numbers increased as the group reproduced itself  and  received  the  children  of  'Negro-White'  and  immigrant  'Anglocoloured' children as well.

The  distinction  between  West  Africans  and  West  Indians  was  not difficult to understand. Although racially allied they were however culturally  'very  different'.  As  far  as  the  West  Indians  were  concerned, slavery had disrupted the culture of the West African slaves. What remained of  this  culture  was  heavily  overlaid  by  the  customs  of  Western  Europe. Consequently,  the  culture  of  the  West  Indians  became  closely  identified with Europe rather than Africa.

For  the  Anglo-coloured,  their  physical  appearance  served  to  prevent their  acceptance  by  Whites  on  the  one  hand,  while  on  the  other,  cultural differences  distinguished  them  from  the  immigrants.  The  result  was  the distinct locally-born group usually called 'the half-caste'.

These  three  divisions  among  the  'Negro'  population  was  of  great importance in understanding the group's social structure. The first important consequence arising out of these culturally determined divisions could be seen in the formation of informal cliques of friends and in the organisation of various  voluntary  associations  within  the  'Negro'  community.  The immigrants may have rejected many aspects of their traditional culture, but had  not  necessarily  rejected  the  whole  of  their  background.  Indeed,  they still  thought  of  themselves  as  primarily  Fanti  or  Gold  Coasters,  as  Ibo  or Nigerians,  as  Jamaicans  or  West  Indians.  Thus,  the  newcomers  firstly identified themselves with their own tribal or home group.

The West African Eru tribe occupied a special position. This group from Liberia  had  'offshoots'  in  Sierra  Leone  and  several  West  African  ports. More often than not, they were employed as seamen along the West African coast. Most other Africans regarded them with some hostility because they were prepared to do the dirtiest work for the lowest wages, thus undercutting  everybody  else.  In  purely  cultural  terms  then,  the  most noticeable  characteristic  of  the  'Negro'  community  in  general,  was  its highly segmented character.

Intergroup relations

Relations between these various sub-groups of the 'Negro' community were characterised  by  a  certain  amount  of  friction.  This  was  clearly  expressed between  the  three  main  sections  of  the  group  -  the  West Africans,  West Indians and Anglo-coloured. The West Africans frequently complained that the West Indians 'think they are better than us'; that they were aggressive and inclined to throw their weight around. The Anglo-coloured complained that West Indians would never give money to support anything, they never worked but lived 'on women and the dole' and would 'come to the party and eat up everything'. Interestingly, West Indians themselves occasionally made  similar  statements  about  their  compatriots. 30 Such  statements  were made by ambitious 'upward mobile' West Indians who feared that the group was 'getting a bad name'.

However, it must not be assumed that these two groups were imbued with  a  sense  of  hostility  towards  each  other.  They  could  not  afford  such hostility, since the indigenous  white  population  did not make  many distinctions between West Indians and Africans. Nevertheless, West Indians and Africans faced common problems in housing, employment and social life.  In  these  circumstances they had no alternative but to co-operate with each other. Consequently, a feeling that all 'Negroes' should unite began to emerge.  Race  consciousness  among  politically  active  West  Indians  made them critical of Africans on the grounds that anything tending to perpetuate the division  between  the  two  groups  should  be  eliminated.  A  'raceconscious' West Indian analysed African-West Indian relations in Liverpool thus: 'The West Indian is ashamed of the African because he is backward, but at the same time he is filled with a burning desire that this were not so. So he will admire and put on a pedestal an African who can achieve a lot. Look how many people admire Nkrumah.' 31

Two sets  of  factors  influenced  this  rising  'race  feeling'.  Firstly,  there was the sense of hostility to Whites which many immigrants seemed to have brought to Britain, in either overt or latent form, and which had increased as a result of experiences in Britain; and secondly, the fact that 'Negroes' had penetrated to some  extent  into the social and  economic  life  of the community. In 1952 there was a strong feeling that all 'Negro' groups must co-operate'.

Formal associations

The formal associations organised by African and West Indians in Liverpool can be broadly classified in terms of cultural and national differences. Six associations were identified: tribal associations, national associations, racial associations,  inter-racial  associations,  religious  associations,  and  defunct and  abortive  associations.  Of  primary  importance  were  the  Tribal  and National Associations. Among the defunct and abortive associations in 1952 were the Colonial Defence Committee, the Anglo-Coloured Association, the Convention People's Party and the Central Council of Social Services. 32

A reasonable average membership for these associations was 40-50. 33 All,  including  the  tribal  associations,  were  organised  with  a  chairman, secretary and executive committee. Attendance at meetings of these 'Negro' associations was irregular and few people came except on special occasions.  It  was  therefore  left  to  those  who  attended  regularly  to  run things.

Tribal  and  National  associations The  proceedings  of  the  meetings  of  the tribal  associations  were  conducted  in  the  tribal  language.  In  this  'closed' organisation, outsiders seeking information could only acquire it at secondhand  from  members  of  these  groups.  Broadly  speaking,  the  tribal  unions functioned as mutual benefit societies. They provided members with help when  difficulties  arose  and  assisted  newcomers  to  Liverpool  in  finding lodgings and in registering at the Employment Exchange. Moreover, they occasionally opposed cases of racial discrimination involving one of their members  and  held  socials  and  lectures.  Among  them  there  was  a  great desire for educational self-improvement. The fundamental activity of these tribal unions was the administration of a benevolent fund to help members in times of crisis such as sickness or a funeral.

These African tribal associations varied considerably in their ability to carry out their activities. Generally, however, the insurance and mutual aid functions  predominated  and  were  likely  to  be  most  successful  among groups with a continuous culture (little disrupted by western influences) in which  in-group  feeling  was  strong.  In  an  emergency,  these  groups  called upon each other for assistance.

There  were,  at  the  time,  four  National  Associations  in  existence: Nigerian, Sierra Leone, Somali and West Indian.

At the outset, it must be pointed out that the activities and goals of the national  associations  were  very  different  from  those  of  the  tribal  unions.

Apart from the usual social activities and lectures, there was strong interest in political activities at home. In particular, these activities were associated with the Independence movement. Further, the mutual aid schemes (unlike the  tribal  associations'  insurance  schemes)  were  protest  activities  oriented to fight racial discrimination in Britain.

The  development  of  'Negro'  associations  until  1953 Among  the  major Negro associations existing in Liverpool at the time were the Merseyside West  Indian  Association,  the  Colonial  Peoples  Defence  Association,  the African  Social  and  Technical  Society,  The  Convention  People's  Party, Stanley House (the community centre), the African Churches Mission, the Inter-racial Committee, and the Colonial Defence Committee. 34

The Merseyside West Indian Association In  1951  a  small  group  of  skilled workers  in  an  ordinance  factory  founded  the  Merseyside  West  Indian Association. They were motivated by a deep sense of insecurity and the real fear  of  redundancy.  They  were  distrustful  of  the  English  workers  in  the factory and felt they could not rely on the trade union or on 'working class solidarity'.  The  dismissal  of  several  West  Indians  had  moved  them  to organise.

In  essence,  these  men  organised  themselves  as  representing  a  'special interest'  group  of  workers  because  they  had  no  confidence  in  the  trade union  leadership.  The  group  became  a  National  Association  with  the following main objectives:

- 1. To foster closer co-operation among West Indians in Merseyside;
- 2. To promote the political and economic welfare of the West Indies;
- 3. To work with all existing  organisations  in  the West  Indies  and  Britain  that  are  fighting  on similar issues;
- 4. To create facilities for the furthering of the cultural development of the West Indies;
- 5. To tackle local issues affecting West Indians. 35

In July 1952, the MWIA sent a representative to a conference (organised by a local clergyman with the assistance of another black organisation the Colonial Peoples' Defence Association, CPDA) on the colour question and sent delegates to a conference on race problems  in Kenya.  It was represented  at  a  meeting  in  London  to  organise  a  British  delegation  to  a Peace  Festival  in  Budapest,  and  to  the  Manchester  Peace  Conference  in 1953. 36 Also in 1952, it supported the Caribbean Labour Congress (London

Branch)  in  a  dispute  with  the  Union  of  Post  Office  Workers  over  the question of promotion for 'Negro' postal workers in London. In this matter, support was confined to passing a resolution endorsing the stand taken by the CLC and sending it a copy.

The Association was particularly concerned with progressive organisations in the West Indies. The Association protested to the Colonial Office  against  the  Trinidad  and  Tobago  government's  refusal  to  permit  a Jamaican representative of the CLC entering the country. It was alleged that this  'representative'  was  endeavouring  to  win  popular  support  for  Seretse Khama, the African leader.

More  directly,  the  Association  attempted  to  establish  contact  with various organisations in the West Indies.

These activities showed that 'pseudo-political protest' was an important part of the Association's programme. It was clear therefore that purely local problems were only part of the Association's concerns. Equally obvious was the  fact  that  the Association  had  virtually  no  contact  with  white  political institutions.

Little practical benefit accrued from their activities. The leadership was primarily  concerned  with  bringing  the  grievances  to  the  attention  of  the authorities, and left them to take whatever action they saw fit. Needless to say, the Association was never able to influence the authorities one way or the other.

White participation and conflict General interest, stimulated by the increase in social activity, had the effect of changing the Association's structure. The membership was broadened to include women, some of whom sat on the Social  Committee.  Many  of  these  women  were  the  white  wives  of  West Indian members.

Nearly all the active members were 'newcomers' and the majority were Jamaicans.  Moreover,  a  large  proportion  of  this  membership  were  skilled workers. While there was unity at certain levels within the Association there was also considerable rivalry arising from differences in outlook between them on questions of policy and on the most appropriate way certain issues ought to be handled.

In  spite  of  their  opposing  views,  the  radicals  and  moderate  factions within the MWIA did not operate as rival groups in any formal organised sense.  Instead  they  reflected  differences  in  temperament  and  outlook.

Clearly  there  was  a  fear,  either  real  or  imagined,  among  the  moderate leaders of 'progressive' elements (for example, the radicals in the Association).  To  them  progressive  was  synonymous  with  communist. Indeed,  following  the  attempt  to  make  contact  with  the  CLC  in  the  West Indies, a few moderates including the chairman, felt that the choice of the left-wing  Congress  was  unfortunate,  'but  could  not  raise  the  issue  of Communism  for  fear  of  provoking  an  open  clash  with  the  Radicals  and perhaps  splitting  the  Association'. 37 While  this  seemed  admirable  and responsible,  the  moderates  went  on  to  criticise  the  radicals'  'emotional attack' on the Colonial Office. Thus, the moderates revealed their primary allegiance to the status quo in a racially divided society.

The Colonial People's Defence Association The Colonial People's Defence Association founded in October 1950 was the 'heir' of an earlier organisation, the Colonial Defence Committee which had come into being following the inter-racial disturbances of 1948. Following the disturbances, arrangements  had  to  be  made  for  the  legal  defence  of  the  arrested 'Negroes'. Contributing towards this were two notable black organisations outside  Liverpool,  namely  the  League  of  Coloured  Peoples  and  the  Pan African League with headquarters in Manchester. Both organisations helped to  raise  funds  for  the  men's  defence.  In  addition,  public  meetings  and conferences  were  held  bringing  together  black  leaders  and  'sympathetic whites'. The links forged through these meetings led to the formation of the CDC. Although the most immediate objective was the legal defence of the arrested  men  none  of  these  organisers  wanted  a  repeat  performance. Therefore,  they  had  intended  that  after  the  trials  the  Committee  should continue to function by promoting better race relations in the city. After the prisoners  were  defended  and  the  Committee  was  formed  it  seemed  the organisers were either too busy to care, or at a loss as to what to do next.

Formation of the CPDA After the war, unemployment was the only reward for the black men who had risked their lives by serving in British and Allied ships. In peacetime these men had become a 'problem'. It was hoped that they  would  be  employed  ashore.  However,  many  of  those  in  their  forties and fifties, did not relish the type of work that might be available.

In 1947, the Colonial Office set up an Advisory Committee to deal with migrant  unemployment  in  Liverpool.  Three  years  later,  the  Committee

expressed  regret  that  there  were  in  Liverpool  about  250  unestablished colonial  seamen  ashore.  More  significantly,  they  feared  the  possibility  of large  numbers  being  discharged  from  the  merchant  navy  establishment. Were they concerned with the unemployment problem or with the prospect of a growing black presence in the city?

Before taking action to deal with these men, a case against them had to be carefully constructed and so the Committee requested what seemed like a  harmless  inquiry.  The  recommendations  emphasised  that  a  restricted number  of  black  men  be  employed  in  accordance  with  merchant  navy requirements and more  importantly, repatriation. Further, the inquiry recommended  that  'To  be  effective  repatriation  arrangements  should  be completed  with  a  minimum  of  delay.' 38   Only  about  200  men  chose repatriation instead of shore work. They had earlier sensed the repatriation designs of the inquiry and now that it became explicit, between 75 and 100 men  were  prepared  to  accept  offers  of  shore  work  instead.  In  short,  the repatriation idea had outraged the black seamen. And justifiably, they feared its compulsory  enforcement.  Only  prompt  action  they  believed  could forestall the real and impending threat to their position in the city. Unlike the CDC in which a large black group was led by a racially mixed group of leaders a new black group was formed under an all black leadership. They wanted to  succeed  the  CDC  and  therefore  wished  to  be  linked  with  it,  if only,  partially,  in  name.  Consequently,  the  Colonial  People's  Defence Association was formed:

To foster unity among the various sections of the coloured race; To protect individual and collective interests of the coloured race; To bring about the abolition of all forms of social discrimination; To provide better understanding between Negro and other races in the city; To provide facilities for mental and racial recreation among members. 39

All  'coloured'  people  including  the  Anglo-coloured  were  eligible  for membership. Soon after its formation, the Association's representatives met members  of  the Advisory  Committee  and  petitioned  the  Colonial  Office, requesting that the recommendations  of  the  Advisory  Committee  be rejected.

The  Colonial  Office  assured  the  CPDA  that  no  seaman  would  be repatriated  against  his  will.  Subsequently,  two  ships  were  manned  by colonial  crews.  Was  this  result  due  to  CPDA  opposition?  Clearly,  CPDA members  felt  that  their  organised  protest  activities  had  exerted  some influence upon the trend of events.

In  March  1951  when  the  Labour  Councillors  on  the  City  Council proposed  that  the  City  Corporations  should  accept  black  workers  as municipal  workers,  the  CPDA  welcomed  the  proposals.  Members  of  the Association were informed that the two trade union representatives on the Council (from the GMWU  and  the  TGWU)  were  mounting  strong opposition to the scheme, on the grounds that they feared an unfavourable reaction on the part of the union membership.

Later,  in  August  that  same  year,  the  CPDA  was  invited  to  attend  a meeting  of  the  sub-committee  of  the  Labour  Party  to  discuss  problems affecting  black  people.  The  sub-committee  promised  to  recommend  that some  of  the  existing  vacancies  in  the  nationalised  industries  should  be allocated to black workers; that the City Council should be further pressed to  employ  black  workers;  and  that  a  serious  attempt  should  be  made  to make it an offence to refuse employment because of racial origin. 40

The effect of this Labour Party initiative had some influence. After the meeting,  the  Trades  Council  wrote  to  all  the  trade  unions  in  Merseyside, informing  them  that  they  should  report  to  the  Council  any  case  of  an employer  who  refused  employment  to  black  workers.  This  monitoring  of racial discrimination  in  employment,  crucially  important  to  the  black community,  was  clearly  an  act  of  solidarity.  For  this,  the  CPDA  was grateful. Indeed, they regarded  the  Trades  Council's  action  as 'very significant', particularly because it was an admission that racial discrimination was being practised by employers, to the extent that it had seriously  affected  the  rate  of  employment  among  black  workers.  This encouraged  the  CPDA  application  for  affiliation  to  the  Trades  Council. Unfortunately affiliation was only open to national associations. Nevertheless, the CPDA had achieved recognition by the Labour Party and the local Trades Council.

Having gained in confidence, the Association sought the co-operation of other  organisations  to  further  the  interests  of  its  members.  It  established

contact with the local Co-operative Party in 1952 and with the Communist Party. 41

In addition to these two political parties, the CPDA also had contact (of an 'informal nature') with specific trade unions. A number of Association members, themselves active trade unionists, performed the role of 'informal liaison officers'. They  drew  the  unions'  attention  to  cases  of  colour discrimination  and  appealed  for  their  active  support  of  the  CPDA.  Here then  was  an  example,  however  fleeting,  of  inter-racial  working  class  cooperation.

Moreover, between 1952 and 1953, the Association dealt with a number of  individual  cases  involving  colour  prejudice.  And  significantly,  it  cooperated with the MWIA in protesting against the closing of the Liverpool Branch  of  the  Colonial  Office,  and  in  passing  resolutions  endorsing  the CLC's stand in the Postal Workers Union dispute. Other activities included finding jobs for the unemployed, accommodation for newcomers to the city, and  providing  legal  advice  for  those  in  need  of  it.  Moreover,  the  CPDA helped to organise a Conference in 1952. The need for closer co-operation between  the  black  and  white  communities  was  highlighted.  The  CPDA's representatives  argued  that  the  'most  sensible  course  of  action'  was  in reorganisation of the Executive Committee to include representatives from other  Negro  associations.  Thus,  it  should  be  recognised  as  the  'official agency' representing the black population.

Having embarked on an educational programme, the CPDA's most loyal social  workers  were  women  who  were  integrated  in  an ad  hoc way.  This practice was stopped and all its social activities were organised by a special committee, the 'General Council of Women'.

This Council had far-reaching consequences for the CPDA. The entirely male-oriented organisation was broken in March 1952, when the GCW was formed. In effect, membership was open to 'all coloured women' and to the white  wives  of  black  men.  Three  women,  two  of  them  white,  sat  on  the Executive  Committee  and  an  'Anglo-coloured'  woman  held  the  post  of Vice-Chairman  of  the  CPDA. 42 The  introduction  of  women  was  fully accepted. Indeed, they had 'enriched' the institutional life of the Association,  essentially  by  their  ability  to  organise  'social  activities'. Significantly, no white men became members.

The African Social and Technical Society The press reports in 1952 of largescale  economic  development  in Africa,  particularly  the  Gold  Coast  V olta River Project, aroused great interest among Blacks in Liverpool. The skilled workers among them were most keen and hopeful of employment.

Amidst  the  rumour  in  September  1952,  a  small  group  of  'Negroes' formed  an Association  with  the  object  of  finding  employment  for  skilled black workers in the Gold Coast and elsewhere in Africa. The aims of the African Social and Technical Society were

- 1. To promote cultural, educational and technical knowledge;
- 2. To foster and promote liaison between all governments that may show interest in our aims;
- 3. To encourage all Africans and peoples of African descent in Merseyside and United Kingdom in general into various Civil Services of any Government that shows interest;
- 4. To  cultivate  and  promote  friendliness  among  all  nations  and  in  particular  the  British Commonwealth  where  possible  and  to  seek  such  aids  for  technical  skill  and  other  vital occupations as may be needed;
- 5. To assist all charitable organisations where and when possible;
- 6. To exhibit from time to time and where permissible the old African plays, dances and other forms of physical education;
- 7. To give moral support to members and where possible render financial aid;
- 8. To  express  sympathy  with  all  such  organisations  or  bodies  that  are  keenly  interested  in helping Africa;
- 9. To do all such things which are permissible by law and which will bring honour and glory to our race. 43

The  ASTS's  Constitution  allowed  it  to  carry  out  a  wide  range  of activities,  except  taking  part  in  political  protest  activities.  Moreover,  the Society became increasingly mutual aid oriented.

On  the  question  of  white  participation,  the  Society's  Constitution expressly provided that anyone irrespective of race, colour or creed could be  enrolled  as  an  associate  member.  Accordingly,  a  dozen  white  women were  accepted  as  'associate  members'. 44 They  consisted  of  wives  and women friends of members. As was the case with the MWIA, no white man ever became a member.

Although there was provision in the Constitution, some men could not overcome their suspicion of Whites. African critics  were  equally  divided: some were willing to accept the membership of white women, while some believed that  their  kind  of  Society  was  'not  women's  business';  therefore they should be excluded. Fortunately this was a minority view reflecting a deep prejudice against women.

In spite of the fact that 'associate member' was not precisely defined, generally these white women expected to participate in the running of social activities and 'not interfere in other matters'. In practice, however, some of them attended general meetings and voted on any motion that happened to come before a meeting. Indeed, their main activity was the organisation of socials.

The ASTS like the MWIA,  sought to establish contacts with organisations  in  the  British  colonies.  Their  petition  to  the  Gold  Coast  for example, had served to make known the Society's existence. Consequently, a list of organisations, prepared by the Executive Committee, showed that most of these organisations were in the West Indies.

In  addition  to  personal  conflicts,  initially  between  the  Chairman  and various members of the Association, there were also serious differences of opinion with the Secretary and both men had to be restrained from coming to blows. Thereafter, confidence in the organisation as a whole, was shaken.

Once the Chairman's leadership was challenged and defeated, the whole structure  collapsed.  It  was  no  wonder  then,  that  the  community  identified the society with the personality of its leader. The inevitable consequence of his disgrace was its collapse.

The Community Centre The Community Centre (or Stanley House) founded in 1946  was  situated  in  an  area  of  'heavy  'Negro'  settlement'.  The interesting thing about this organisation is that it was first launched in 1943 by a group of prominent Whites. 45

The membership (reaching 285 in 1954) 46 made the Centre the largest 'Negro' Association  in  the  city.  In  an  effort  to  attract  more  members  the management  relaxed  its  regulations.  This  resulted  in  a  larger  number  of non-members patronising the Centre than members. The consensus within the  community  was  that  the  Centre,  instead  of  being  segregated  (thus running the risk of becoming a 'Little Harlem'), should be run on general inter-racial lines. But how did the Centre relate to other 'Negro' groups in the community? In fact, it had had little contact with other 'Negro' groups.

The African Churches Mission The African Churches Mission was the only church  in  the  city,  at  the  time,  being  run  by  'Negroes'.  Located  near  the docks, in 1930 it was described as containing a larger proportion of Negroes than any other part of the city. The Mission occupied a building which was

in a state of 'extreme disrepair', and the Pastor and his close associates gave the general impression of 'extreme poverty'. Sunday services were usually attended  by  a  small  congregation  of  about  twelve  people  which  included members  from  all  three  black  groups  -  the  MWIA,  ASTS  and  the Community Centre. West Africans were its main supporters.

Like  the  previous  leaders  mentioned,  the  Pastor  too  was  subjected  to severe criticism. Two things worked against him: firstly, due to advanced age and a reputation for being difficult to work with, the Pastor no longer took an active part in the various protest activities of the 'Negro' groups; secondly, he did not have much prestige among the younger better educated men who led the protest action.

The allegation that black people had been discouraged from attending white  churches  raised  real  doubts  as  to  the  value  of  Christianity  in  the minds of black people. Recalling their upbringing in the Christian churches in their respective colonial homelands, many continued to maintain a more or less conventional life-style with an emotion-charged content, particularly in view of their economic, social and political deprivation. By contrast, in Britain, the approach to religion was tinged with doubt; they were sceptical and restrained. Many became disillusioned. Most West Africans in the city had been educated in Mission schools through which they formulated their initial  conceptions  of  life  in  Britain.  However,  they  quickly  realised  that Christianity was associated with the ruling class. Therefore, it was not easy for  them  to  reconcile  the  doctrine  of  'love  thy  neighbour'  with  their  hard experiences of life in a modern British industrial slum. For another thing, they did not fail to observe the fact that most white people did not attend church services, and for many of those who did, attendance was irregular. Many Blacks interpreted this as a lack of faith.

To add to their scepticism, the newcomers especially were not attracted to the image of the poverty-striken Mission with its aged, poorly educated Pastor. Generally then, it seemed that most of these 'colonised' newcomers with  strong  religious  beliefs  attended  a  white  church  in  preference  to  the Mission. Most of the rest attended church erratically, and some not at all. In effect, the  black/white  schism,  revealed  in  both  secular  and  religious organisations, remained a complex pattern.

The People's Convention Party The idea of forming a branch of the Gold Coast Convention People's Party was given expression in 1952 by a man (a

former  law  student  who  failed  to  qualify)  reputed  to  be  'a  relative  of Kwame Nkrumah.' 47   This  individual,  'considerably  better  educated'  than the  great  majority  of  black  people  was  unpopular  with  another  section  of the  African  community  which  accused  him  of  'living  on  his  wits'  and exploiting the people who turned to him for advice and help. Some were so distrustful of him that he was even regarded as a 'police informer'.

When he returned to Liverpool in 1952 after a trip to the Gold Coast, he announced that the leaders of the CPP had commissioned him to organise a branch of the Party in Liverpool. In spite of opposition, he began organising activities.  After  a  few  weeks  of  regular  meetings,  there  were  serious disagreements. Quarrels, and his 'dubious reputation' had a harmful effect on the organisation. 48 As the situation deterioriated, the CPP itself gave no assistance  to  its  new  British  branch.  This  lack  of  support  did  not  go unremarked  among  the  leader's  enemies  who  said  that  he  had  not  really been given a mandate to organise the branch of the Party, but was simply 'working  on  his  own'.  Since  he  had  no  real  proof,  this  remained  the fundamental  issue  of  contention.  Clearly  the  organisation  had  failed  to attract and hold the loyalty of the marjority of members although a 'small nucleus' continued to hold occasional meetings which were largely directed to the organisation's nationalistic aspirations.

Other  Organisations Among  the  more  important  of  the  other  'Negro' organisations in Liverpool in 1952 were the Inter-racial Committee and the Anglo-Coloured  Association.  The  main  result  of  the  Conference  held  in July 1952 was the proposal to set up a special Committee to represent the 'coloured population'. Although by 1953, no such Committee was created, the proposal resulted in a great deal of activity, which not surprisingly was disrupted by disagreements among the various groups.

The main differences of opinion were in respect to the structure of the new  Committee.  Eventually,  the  Blacks,  impatient  of  waiting  for  white approval, went ahead with their own discussions and efforts to organise the Committee.

The  wide  differences of opinion concerning  the structure of the Committee reflected  the  differences  inherent  in  the  structure  of  the  black community. It was clear that some people wished to retain their tribal and national  identities,  while  others  advocated  group  representation  merely because they believed that co-operation would be difficult to achieve on any

other basis. Others, impatient with internal divisions within the community, wished to ignore them and to organise on a purely 'racial' basis. Although several meetings were held, no synthesis of the various viewpoints was ever achieved.  Consequently,  the  project  of  an  Inter-racial  Committee  was abandoned.

The  other  organisation,  the  Anglo-Coloured  Association  (founded  in Liverpool by a black American) was designed to provide employment for the membership by developing 'Negro'-operated shops and other undertakings. When the founder, obviously the leading light, left Liverpool, the ACA disintegrated without having achieved any of its objectives.

Associations in Africa and the West Indies Regarding associations in Africa and the West Indies, one is mainly concerned with their development in the urban  areas  of  these  territories,  since  they  were  relevant  to  the  essential urban conditions in which most 'Negroes' lived in Liverpool and the rest of Britain.  Indeed,  one  was  concerned  with  associations  such  as  the  major political parties or the larger colonial trade unions to a limited degree, since 'Negroes' in Britain during the early 1950s lacked the numbers to organise and run successfully organisations of this type. As it was, in Liverpool at least, they had not attempted to do so.

Among the African associations there is an abundance of evidence that the urbanisation of Africa had been accompanied by the formation of a large number  of  voluntary  associations  of  very  varied  character  such  as  tribal unions, friendly societies, occupational associations and recreational associations. Perhaps the most notable feature of these associations was the great variety of their functions, but there is some evidence that many of the new types of associations (for example, those identified as 'nontraditional') were  frequently unstable and  in some  areas  even  tribal groupings had not long survived the impact of modern life.

It seemed therefore that the background of West African immigrants to Liverpool was rich in associational activities. However, a high proportion of these organisations were themselves the result of urban living and were not established in the sense of having a long history and traditions of their own.

In the West Indian context, one is particularly concerned with associations which recruited members largely from the lower class. These have  been  divided  into  two  broad  categories:  (i)  associations  composed mainly  of  lower  class  members  with  a  proportion  of  members  of  higher

status levels, who hold most of the offices and run the organisation; and (ii) exclusively lower class associations. The large and influential professional and  social  organisations  such  as  the  Jamaican  Union  of  Teachers  or  the Kingston Club, related to status and did not on the whole contribute to the West Indian population of Liverpool. Associations functioning in the urban areas were the churches of the major religious denominations, political and trade union groups, friendly societies and ratepayers' associations. Friendly societies  were  particularly  interesting  in  that  they  appeared  both  in  urban and rural areas and were widespread through the Caribbean. In 1946 there were 161 in Barbados and 317 in Trinidad with a total membership of over 97,000 in the former and 121,000 in the latter.

In  general  aim  and  details  of  structure,  these  societies  resembled  the English Friendly Societies. For example, they provided benefits at death, in sickness  and  in  old  age,  and  made  loans.  Moreover,  in  some  cases  they owned property and profits were distributed to members. In spite of these secular  matters,  the  activities  of  many  of  these  societies  had  a  strong religious flavour.

Most of these associations were to be found in towns. In the rural areas, most group activities involving economic objectives or mutual aid, tended to be  organised  informally  between  relatives,  friends  and  neighbours. 'Lower class' organisations had much bearing on the West Indian working class. The most characteristic type of associations created by them were the religious  cults  such  as  Pocomania  (and  other  revivalist  sects  in  Jamaica), Shouters in the Eastern Caribbean, and Shango in Trinidad. In addition to their  religious  activities,  some  of  these  groups  performed  functions  of mutual aid. Some go much further. The Ras Tafari cult in Jamaica must be considered  politico-religious  for  the  members  believe  that  Haile  Selassie was the living God who would one day arrange their return to Africa, and that one day 'Negroes' will dominate Whites. While the Pocomania and Ras Tafari  cults  have  been  in  existence  for  years  and  continue  to  flourish, specific groups of both types dissolved and coalesced with great rapidity. It is clear then that West Indian migrants to Britain came from a background less  rich  in  associational  structures  than  do  West  Africans.  There  is  an accent on informality which does appear to be characteristic of Africans.

Characteristics of the 'Negro' group One of the main characteristics of the 'Negro'  group  as  a  whole  was  its  'highly  segmented  structure'.  The  sub-

groups were further divided in terms of status and 'style of life' regarding length of residence in the city.

Within  the  'Negro'  community  there  was  no  basic  homogeneity  in outlook,  manner  of  thought  and  personal  habits  to  develop  an  integrated community life of their own. In fact, the concept of a 'Negro community' was  misleading.  Indeed,  one  was  better  able  to  understand  the  social structure of the so-called 'Liverpool Negro Community' if one regarded it as consisting initially of an agglomeration of small groups which increased in  numbers  as  a  result  of  immigration.  Basically,  these  small  groups  had little  in  common,  other  than  an  awareness  of  their  racial  similarity,  as distinct  from  the  members  of  the  host  society.  By  1952  the  'Negro' community in Liverpool could only be considered for historical reasons, as a  community  only  in  a  very  crude  sense.  Most  'Negroes'  had  closer relations with  each  other  than  with  other  ethnic  groups.  The  closest relationships  of  an  individual  however  were  likely  to  be  within  his  own tribal  or  national  group.  The  'Negro'  population  as  a  whole  lacked  the organisation of the institutions which were usually associated with a highly developed  community  life.  Thus  the  'Negro'  population  comprised  a number of  sub-groups.  In  Liverpool,  they  had  not  reached  a  stage  where they  felt  as  'one  people'.  Indeed,  the  ties  linking  the  various  tribes  and national  organisations  were  tenuous  and  mutual  jealousy  was  still  strong. The racial  feeling  upon  which  'Negro'  (as  distinct  from  tribal  or  national identifications)  group  feeling  partly  rests,  was  neither  a  new  nor  a  local phenomenon, but merely one manifestation of a more widespread development which resulted  in  the  organisation  of  conferences  to  discuss the  problems  of  the  'Negro'.  There  was  also  the  attempt  to  build  a permanent  organisation  dedicated  to  the  ideals  of  'Negro'  unity  and  cooperation. In 1952 co-operation between 'Negro' groups was achieved only with great difficulty. It was, however, even more difficult to maintain, never mind increase, that co-operation. Once a crisis was over, the old divisions reappeared and co-operation petered out, leaving in some cases, the group leaders without followers.

Among those factors that  contributed  to  the  formation  of  associations and  which  determined  their  main  characteristics  were  traditional  forms, feelings of insecurity and the need to emphasise group solidarity, assimilative drives, the degree of concentration of the group, and incidents which precipitate activity. The associations themselves fell into categories

which had been described as tribal and national, for example. They could also  be  classified  in  terms  of  the  main  orientation  towards  the  members' country of origin or towards life in Liverpool. The two types of orientation were labelled 'traditionalist' and 'modern'. 49

As  it  was,  the  'Negro'  migrants  lacked  the  formation  of  institutions which  were  culturally  uniform  groups.  But  it  was  evident  that  traditional tribal divisions were still an important element in the total social situation since many of them were largely tribal in composition. Indeed, the largest and most successful associations appeared to be purely tribal in character. But  what  was  the  'Negro'  associations'  role  in  the  context  of  inter-group relations?

The voluntary associations of all  important  minority  groups  tended  to have  certain  basic  functions,  but  in  addition  they  were  likely  to  acquire special characteristics resulting from  the contact situation. Thus, the adjustment  of  Liverpool  'Negro'  migrants  and  the  role  of  their  voluntary associations in the total contact situation forms a part of the wider pattern of race relations in Britain. Associations with similar characteristics occurred in  other  parts  of  the  country  such  as  the  League  of  Coloured  Peoples  in London, and the Pan African League in Manchester. Similarly, there were the  tribal  organisations  in  East  London, 50 the  defunct  Afro-West  Indian Friendly  Society  in  dockland  and,  since  the  volume  of  West  Indian migration  increased,  similar  associations  had  been  formed  in  the  'Negro' communities  of  the  Midlands.  The  League  of  Coloured  Peoples  was  the only  association  which  could  be  said  to  have  had  more  than  purely  local influence and it is noteworthy that in this case, much of the leadership was of a 'traditional' West Indian type in the sense that the founder and leader of the organisation possessed personal attributes and the status to play a role which the West Indian migrants regarded, to some degree, as appropriate. Thus  'Negro'  associational  activities  in  Liverpool  were  similar  in  most aspects to their counterparts in other parts of Britain. The chief difference was that in 1952 there were more voluntary associations in Liverpool than in most other communities.

On the question of leadership, it was pointed out that immigrant groups adjusted  most  successfully  and  were  likely  to  assimilate  most  rapidly  if traditional  and  accepted  leaders  were  present,  provided  the  goals  of  the leaders were compatible with the demands of the host society. There was no

traditional elite in Liverpool and in any case the ethnic composition of the 'Negro' population was so complex that the presence of a number of leaders of the traditional type might have exerted a divisive influence. A new elite had not as yet arisen in a form that was acceptable to the group as a whole, or  to  a  major  part  of  it,  and  the  contact  situation  tended  to  increase difficulties of leadership on this level. The chief effect of this situation was that individuals who presented themselves as leaders tended to be regarded as self-seeking upstarts.

In  general,  Liverpool  'Negro'  associations  were  similar  to  equivalent organisations among other ethnic groups in Britain at the time, in that they sought to maintain group solidarity, maintain contact with the past, and aid in the adjustment to new conditions.

## Asian workers' associations

## Pre-1969 developments

Immigrants from the Indian sub-continent living in Britain formed various associations which fell within two broad categories. First, there were those who sought to provide the cultural activities of the regional society in India, and secondly, those associations which were organised to deal directly with problems arising out of the new relationship with British society. Moreover, the  first  was  concerned  with  the  immigrants  who  operated  as  part  of  the internal structure of the immigrant community. In effect, it existed to make cultural activities possible. On  the other hand, the second type of association  was  primarily  political  in that it sought  to  represent  the immigrant community as a whole in its relations to the host society. Both types of associations provided opportunities for leadership and the exercise of  authority  -  'activities  which  are  denied  to,  and  refused  by,  Indian immigrants in the social organisation of the host society'. 51

In  October  1959  the Bharatiya Mandala (the  Indian Association)  was founded in Bradford by a student immigrant, formerly a high-school teacher in Gujarat. He and his friends began by organising a meeting to celebrate Divali  (the  most  important  festival  in  the  Gujarat  Calendar).  A  cultural programme  was  arranged  and  all  Gujaratis  in  the  area  were  invited  to attend. The aim was to form a permanent cultural association which would, among other things, provide a library with Gujarati books, periodicals and

newspapers,  a  recreational  club  where  local  Gujarati  families  could  meet and an educational centre for children to learn to read and write Gujarati and for adults to learn the English language. Significantly, the Association had no 'political' aims.

In  contrast  to  this  organisation,  there  was  the  Indian  Society  of  Great Britain,  established  in  Birmingham.  This  organisation  was  a  failure.  Its primary object of uniting the Indian community in the area was frustrated by  prolonged  wrangles  arising  from  factional  loyalty. 52 In short, the difference  between  the  Bradford  and  Birmingham  Associations  was  the basic unity in the former and its absence in the latter. However, it must be remembered  that  unity,  to  some  degree,  existed  in  Bradford  before  the Association, and indeed, independently of it.

Film  societies In  towns  in  the  Midlands  and  elsewhere  in  the  United Kingdom where the Indo-Pakistanis resided in sufficient numbers (before videos became popular) local cinemas showed Indian and Pakistani films at weekends and on holidays. These shows, usually run by film societies, were also run by private enterprises and sometimes by cultural associations. The film  societies  were  regarded  as  friendly  societies.  In  fact,  many  film societies (in spite of legal impediments) were private business concerns. A privately-owned  film  society  could  not  obtain  tax  exemption  and  other benefits if it did not register as a friendly society. Hence all film societies appeared to be democratically organised and managed friendly societies.

The  Eastern  Film  Society  was  founded  in  January  1956  in  the  West Midlands  where  approximately  10,000  Indo-Pakistani  immigrants  lived. 53 The  founders  and  members  of  the  first  Executive  were  Punjabi-speaking Sikhs from the Jullundur district in India, most of whom knew each other. The  Society  hired  films  from  the  Indian  Film  Society  in  London  which, apart from showing films in London also rented its films to provincial film societies.

In  promoting  one  of  its  aims  of  fostering  education  in  English,  the Society  made  donations  to  the  Commonwealth  Centre  and  to  the  West Bromwich Education Department 'for equipment for Indian and Pakistani children classes' and bought linguaphone records in English and Hindustani. Understandably, the ability to speak and write English fluently, was a major preoccupation among members of the Asian community.

By  1961,  business  had  grown.  There  were  four  film  societies  in  the Birmingham area. Competition for more or less the same audience led to conflict.  To  sum  up,  film  societies  brought  together,  in  an  essentially cultural context, Indians and Pakistanis from the various immigrant communities.  The  formal  structure  of  the  film  societies  reflected  in  their executive  body,  linguistic  and  regional  isolation.  On  the  other  hand,  the political association differed from others in that one expressed purpose was to regulate relationships between Indian immigrants and the host society.

The Indian Workers' Association: leaders and their supporters For the vast majority of immigrants from India and Pakistan, their inability to speak or write  the  English  language  posed  a  difficult  problem  in  their  daily  life  in dealing  with  the  British  bureaucratic  machine.  For  those  who  could,  they felt  duty-bound to help their fellow villagers in the tasks of letter writing and form-filling, endemic in British life.

In the early 1950s there were not many immigrants capable of helping themselves, never mind assisting their compatriots in such time-consuming assistance.

Manmohan Singh Basra, who had come to Britain in 1953 felt the full impact  of  this  need  among  his  fellow-immigrants  to  the  extent  that  'he hardly  had  a  moment  to  relax'.  The  size  of  the  problem  required  the assistance of a formal organisation working systematically. Basra and a few 'socially active' Indians decided to establish such an organisation. Thus, in 1956, they founded the Indian Workers' Association in South Staffordshire. Soon after they were able to claim 150 members. 54  This name was derived from an earlier organisation.

In  1938  three  Indian  workers,  Udham  Singh  (a  trade  union  activist  in the  Electrical  Trade  union,  and  a  delegate  to  the  local  Trades  Council), Ujjager Singh, and Akbar Ali Khan formed the Indian Workers' Association in Coventry. 55 This name was carefully chosen in order to avoid confusion with the middle-class India League  (formed in 1929 and primarily concerned with Indian Independence) and the Birmingham Indian Association,  with  a  student  and  doctor  membership.  The  IWA's  members were Punjabi pedlars from the Midlands and factory workers in Coventry. A similar  group  was  organised  in  London.  Middle-class  Indians,  such  as Gujarati doctors, who were scattered all over the country, joined local India Leagues  which  included  many  English  sympathisers  with  the  cause  of

Independence.  Both  organisations  worked  for  the  cause  and  co-operated with Indian students and intellectuals in London.  Quite often these intellectuals provided  leadership  for  both  the  Leagues  and  the  IWA. However,  the  IWA  was  essentially  trade  union-oriented  while  the  India League concentrated on politics. After playing a significant role, following Indian Independence in 1947, these Associations declined.

In  effect,  the  IWAs  were  essentially  voluntary  associations  concerned both with Indians in Britain and with the continuing ties which immigrants have  with  India.  However,  the  IWAs  were  primarily  welfare  and  social organisations.  Membership  was  open  to  any  Indian  in  Britain.  Although they did not, in practice, represent all Indians in Britain they had the support of most Punjabis. Until about 1967, the exceptions were a few pedlars.

There were signs between 1966  and 1967  that the IWAs  were weakening. New organisations had been formed. Moreover, some Punjabis won posts in prominent British organisations, and the IWAs in many areas were split. Furthermore, some IWAs found new roles while others declined in prominence.

Nevertheless by 1965 the IWAs were the most important organisations in  the  Punjabi  communities.  Interest  had  been  intense  at  election  time. Every  two  years  each  Punjabi  community  held  local  IWA  elections.  The campaigns of these Indian 'politicians' were elaborate.

Ilaqa groupings Among the Indians in Britain during the 1950s and 1960s, village  and  kinship  ties  were  all-important.  Usually,  IWAs  consisted  of immigrants from a group of adjacent villages called a 'village-kin group' because they were linked by a combination of village and kin ties. Some IWAs, however, were coalitions of two or more village-kin groups. 56

Ilaqa (or area) ties were therefore of importance for two reasons: firstly, the pattern of friendship among the immigrants and secondly, the rules of behaviour towards those to whom one was indebted, and with whom one lived. Within each Ilaqa group a few men were influential. Family influence back in the Punjab was important. However, most leaders won popularity within their Ilaqa group through their activities in Britain. Many immigrants saved a great deal of money, some of which they sent home to support their families. Others invested in shops and/or houses in Britain. A man who owned many houses was able to win control over the votes of a

large number of migrants who were his tenants. Thus a politically-oriented landlord was assured of support during the IWA elections.

Another kind of influence was derived through friendly relations with English  foremen  in  factories.  Those  who  spoke  English  fluently  were among  those  who  got  jobs  for  their  friends  and  had,  in  some  cases, influence  in  the  allocation  of  overtime.  In  addition,  some  men  found  a shorter  road  to  positions  of  influence.  They  began  as  political  activists. Such  men  spent  much  time  forming  friendships  in  public  houses  and engaged  in  speaking  at  public  meetings  and  generally  made  themselves known by collecting IWA memberships and organising social functions, or classes  to  teach  English  to  immigrants.  These  'activists'  however,  were under enormous pressure to compromise with the influential men from their Ilaqas and from others. 57

Within  the  IWAs  there  were  groups  and  quasi-groups.  While  social activities  brought  Indian  migrants  from  the  various Ilaqas together  there were other more important forces at work to break down the unity of these groups.  One  such  force  was  the  rise  of  men  who  did  'large  numbers  of favours'  for  immigrants.  These  'social  workers'  were  at  a  premium  since few migrants had the time to do social work.

Doing social work was a recognised means of winning influence within one's Ilaqa group. In time, these social workers had a growing influence on migrants to the extent that they began doing favours for men outside their Ilaqa group.  Thus  a  few  men  with  no Ilaqa support  were  able  to  build  a following based on their social work. Two such types whose jobs allowed them to spend a great deal of time doing social work were insurance agents and shopkeepers. Moreover, those who organised Indian film shows often became outstanding social workers.

Gradually, Ilaqa groups  began  to  lose  their  political  unity  as  the activities  of  social  workers  forged  new  ties  which  cut  across Ilaqa lines. Simultaneously, many Ilaqa groups  were  losing  their  social  cohesiveness. Hitherto, there were few women in Punjabi settlements. Consequently, the men lived in lodging houses. The arrival of wives and other women in the early 1960s shifted the social life in the Punjabi communities from lodging houses and pubs to private homes. 58 Thus, the shift from lodging houses to family  homes not only increased but coincided with the decline of social groups composed largely of men from nearby villages.

Nevertheless,  some Ilaqas maintained  their  social  unity  since  in  each Punjabi settlement there were a few Ilaqas which were represented by a few closely related families. The kinship ties cemented relations between these families. However, in their new environment, the pattern began to change and the larger groups of village-mates could only maintain their social unity when they were able to find a social focus. In many cases, where men from adjacent villages lived in the same Punjabi settlement, they were referred to as  a  'quasi-group'.  The  simple  distinction  between  the  'group'  and  the 'quasi-group' was made because it was becoming increasingly clear that the village-mates were no longer acting together in IWA politics. Indeed, their support  was  not  influenced  by  any  consideration  of  loyalty  to  the  group. Nonetheless,  the  leader's  role  remained  crucial.  He  would  often  mobilise his  village-mates'  support  on  the  basis  of  personal  loyalties  to  him  for without his guidance, the villagers tended to back different candidates.

Another element in the IWA political scene was the 'action-set' used for specific  occasions.  The  action-set  was  the  complex  of  ties,  individual  or family, clique or work-group, and quasi-group, which surrounded an IWA politician.  Moreover,  action-sets  were  not  confined  to  politicians. 59 Other men  were  able  to  set  themselves  up  as  opinion  leaders.  However,  the changing  pattern  of  association  had  become  clear-cut  -  the  village-mates were  no  longer  a  social  or  political  group.  Some  were  likely  to  become quasi-groups. 60 Although  some  questioned  village  loyalties  as  not  being 'progressive', on balance the great majority of migrants remained loyal to their Ilaqa politicians.

Overall,  in  the  relationship  between  the  leaders  and  their  followers, essentially,  the  ordinary  Indian  immigrants  joined  the  IWAs  and  voted  in elections because the leaders asked them to do so. Group solidarity in terms of kinship and obligation was very much in evidence. 61

Leaders and elections in IWA politics Within  the  Punjabi  communities,  it was  clear  that  many  leaders  had  independent  power  bases. And  although loyalties based on personal obligation were rooted in kinship ties and past favours, it is equally clear that a leader could change his position (forging alliances and breaking them) 'without losing very many of his followers'. Until  1965,  at  least,  it  was  particularly  noticeable  that  almost  all  these 'independent' leaders in the Punjabi communities participated in the same local IWA.

Two  main  reasons  had  been  advanced  for  the  involvement  of  all influential  Punjabis  in  IWA  politics.  Firstly,  there  was  a  strong  feeling among the  migrants  that  the  Punjabi  community  should  be  united.  Unity came naturally to the proud Sikhs who placed a high value on it. Secondly, their  common appearance and uniform ensured easy recognition. One can easily  spot  a  true  Sikh  in  a  crowd.  Lastly  a  common  uniform  fosters brotherhood and a sense of unity in the community. Historically, the rituals of the Sikhs were prescribed not only to preserve the corporate life of the community,  but  also  to  remind  the  Sikh  to  play  his  part  as  a  unit  of  the Panth (Community of Sikhs). 62

Religious devotion was fused with loyalty to the community. Proud of their community, the bond of brotherhood unites them.

The second reason for the involvement of Punjabis in IWA politics was the  homogeneity  of  the  Punjabi  immigrant  community. According  to  one estimate,  an  overwhelming  majority,  some  90  per  cent  were  of  the  same caste. 63 In addition, they came from a small area, having done similar work which they left for similar reasons. In Britain, they found similar jobs, and earned  more  or  less  the  same  wages.  In  effect,  they  faced  common problems.  It  followed  that  this  homogeneity  of  experience  could  best  be understood, and a campaign mobilised to tackle their problems in Britain, through  one  organisation.  Hence  their  united  front  within  the  culturally based IWA.

The high value of unity demanded organisation and, it seemed, the one reinforced the other. Thus it was usual to find in Punjabi communities an organised  group  of  members  working  towards  unity.  This  group  was composed of Indian members of the Communist Party in Great Britain. For Indians so inclined, this was a real opportunity not to be missed, given the fact that few of those immigrants had been Party members in India where joining the Communist Party was very difficult. According to the migrants, it  involved  a  great  deal  of  party  work  and  a  probationary  period  of  about two years before admission. By comparison, as one immigrant put it, 'You can join the Party in this country just by filling in a blank in the Morning Star ', whereas in the Punjab it was 'easier to get into the IAS (India's elite Civil Service Corps) than into the Communist Party. 64

Once  in  the  CPGB  though,  there  were  other  problems.  For  example, they  could  not  speak  English  to  the  extent  of  participating  in  the  party

meetings. Therefore with the blessings of the CPGB they were allowed to meet separately. Thus, until  1966,  in  the  large  Punjabi  communities  there were two separate branches of the CPGB. In the main, these Indian CPGB branches ignored British politics. Indeed, until recently, they had few ideas about what should be done on race relations in Britain. On the other hand, the CPGB seemed too preoccupied to offer much guidance. Inevitably, the Indian Communists were more involved in the politics of India.

Apart  from  these  pursuits,  these  Communists  worked  towards  unity, organising  Indian  migrant  associations  on  the  basis  of  class  interests.  In time,  they  established  a  strong  foothold  in  the  IWAs. As  social  workers, they were particularly active. The Communist branches included both men of  influence  within  large Ilaqa groups  and  quasi-groups  which  cut  across Ilaqa lines.  The  Communists'  willingness  to  work  with  influential  nonCommunists  meant  a  large  IWA  membership,  whenever  the  Communists and other allies were in power. In effect then, whether in or out of power the Communists were assured of wide-based support which contributed towards uniting the Punjabi community.

As mentioned earlier many influential migrants in the Punjabi communities became politicians while others, equally drawn into leadership positions,  were  either  powers  behind  the  scenes  or  opinion  leaders. Thus, the  competition  for  influence  and  prestige  became  structured  in  terms  of IWA policies.

The IWA group structure During membership drives and the first weeks of an  election  campaign,  two  alliances  or  'groups'  tended  to  emerge.  The Indian branch of the local Communist Party formed the core of one group. The other  alliance  was  known  by  the  name  of  the  Presidential  candidate. This candidate was rarely a man of great influence within the alliance since the men wielding real power did not want any challenge from that office.

Internal  dissensions  within  both  alliances  led  to  divisions  into  rival cliques. Nevertheless both groups struggled to achieve cohesiveness. In the Communist group there were ideological and personal conflicts. The basic flaw in the non-Communist groups was their ad hoc nature. Not surprisingly,  between elections they lacked unity, essentially because they were composed of several 'cliques of politicians' who were not interested in an alliance with the Communist Party.

In a few communities the core of the non-Communist alliance was the office-holders  of  the  local gurdwaras which  were  administered  by  a Granthi (priest).

The position that officers of a gurdwara held within a non-Communist alliance was not unlike the position of the Communists' branch within the Communist alliance. The bond that held gurdwara officers was not formal discipline but friendship resulting from  working  together within the gurdwara .

Gurdwaras were an integral part of IWA politics. Indeed it was rare for them  to  stay  aloof  or  withdraw.  Where  the gurdwara was  large  and economically viable (indeed few achieved this) their internal politics tended to  be  an  extension  of  IWA  politics. Gurdwara elections  were  open  to  all Sikhs (by birth at least) who lived in the local community. Not surprisingly, in  many  instances  the  same  politicians  fought  both gurdwara and  IWA elections.

The most important features of IWA politics - the Ilaqa groupings, the 'social workers' and the continuous struggles for prestige - had parallels in the  experience  of  other  migrant  groups.  But  among  the  Punjabis  each  of these institutions had a character which was quite unique.

Between 1965 and 1967 however, IWA politics including these essential features,  had  begun  to  change  significantly  reflecting,  in  part,  political trends  in  India.  They  also  reflected  the  impact  of  life  in  Britain  on immigrants.  There  were  four  aspects  of  this  influence  which  were  very important for  IWA politics:  (i),  the  immigrant  settlements  were  becoming permanent  communities  composed  largely  of  families;  (ii),  individual migrants  were  learning  how  to  get  along  in  daily  life  without  their comrades' help; (iii), the Punjabi communities were becoming differentiated  along  caste,  religious,  class  and  educational  lines;  and  (iv), the migrants were increasingly aware of their low status in British society. 65

Punjabi  immigrant  politics The  political  situations  in  Southall,  Coventry and Birmingham were dissimilar. At one time, the Coventry Punjabis were the  only  community  without  a  splinter  IWA.  This  unity,  however,  was shattered and by the summer of 1967, there were two IWAs in Coventry and there  seemed  little  hope  of  reconciliation.  Both  organisations  continued with such activities as social work, campaigning during Indian elections and holding celebrations. 66

In  Birmingham,  there  were  indications  that  the  Punjabi  communities would develop organisations which were essentially concerned with combating racial discrimination in Britain. In Birmingham also there was a split which put one of the IWAs out of action for several months. The other IWA, the IWA-GB-Birmingham remained active. This group had 'sophisticated  leaders'  who  took  a  militant  stand  on  race  relations.  The branch  condemned  the  Labour  government's  policy  on  immigration  as 'racialist' and refused to participate in the National Committee  for Commonwealth  Immigrants.  These  leaders  wanted  a  concerted  effort  to build  support  for  their  position  among  the  Punjabis  in  the  Midlands.  In doing  so,  they  organised  protest  meetings  and  marches.  This  last  method was radical - a clear shift from traditional methods.

The  situation  in  Southall  was,  however,  different.  The  alliances  there had, by 1968, split into at least eight small cliques, all competing for control of  the  same  IWA. 67 In  addition,  the  minority  castes  and  religious  groups formed their own associations. Their officials, however, competed in IWA elections as new 'groups'. Furthermore, in Southall there were other formal organisations including a literary society and a number of gurdwaras ,  and caste  associations. Apart  from  one  very  large gurdwara ,  almost  all  of  the activists in Southall were involved in IWA politics in one way or another. It was not difficult to see why. The Southall Punjabi community was one of the  largest  in  the  country,  and  it  was  more  concentrated  in  terms  of  area than the other large Punjabi communities. For many years the IWA Southall was  alone  in  running  Indian  film  shows  in  Southall,  shows  which  were profitable. Indeed, at that time, the Southall IWA was the only IWA which owned an office as well as a cinema. In effect, the IWA-Southall towered over  the  rival  associations,  reducing  them  to  playing  a  supporting  role  in terms of power and influence.

Generally,  in  towns  where  the  IWA  had  no  control  over  a  cinema  or church,  the  local  associations  were  likely  to  go  the  way  of  the  Coventry IWA.  A  few  were  also  likely  to  follow  in  the  militant  footsteps  of  the Birmingham  IWA-GB.  Looking  ahead,  the  number  that  were  likely  to follow  the  Birmingham  pattern  was  dependent  on  the  extent  of  racial discrimination and the course this was likely to follow.

Relations  with  British  organisations During  the  sixties,  the  IWA  leaders faced  many  difficulties  when  they  became  involved  in  trade  unions,

constituency Labour Parties, or inter-racial committees such as the Voluntary Liaison Committees supported by the NCCI.

As a result of the British government's concern with black immigrants (and  immigration)  by  giving  financial  support  to  the  V oluntary  Liaison Committees  (VLCs),  Punjabi  leaders  had  more  opportunities  to  serve  on such  bodies.  The  willingness  of  these  immigrant  leaders  to  participate, reflected the growing pressure and concern over racial discrimination in the immigrant community. Their participation, however, was effectively contained by these British-dominated organisations. This was the dilemma facing the IWA leaders who were involved in three kinds of associations, namely  the  trade unions, constituency Labour  Parties and  interracial committees.

The  IWAs  and  trade  unions The  trade  unions  had,  above  all  British institutions, the closest contacts with the largest number of adult Punjabis. As  workers,  the  Punjabis  came  face  to  face  with  British  working  class values  and  patterns  of  behaviour.  In  the  uneasy  relationship  between  the unions and the immigrants the occasional Indian shop steward was pivotal; a double-liaison. He not only had to be a workmate and leader within his work  group,  but  he  also  had  to  come  to  terms  with  white  trade  union officials  and  foremen  and  with  his  role  as  shop  steward.  Inevitably,  there were conflicts, and the IWA had a role to play in relating to its members as workers and shop stewards, and with white trade unionists.

Punjabi workers were engaged in two kinds of work situation: working with Whites as bus drivers, conductors and factory workers and working in shops which included only migrants. Some of these shops employed only Punjabis.  Most  of  these  all-immigrant  shops  fell  into  one  of  two  further classes. The workers were either members of the TGWU or were left at the mercy of a padrone system. 68 Under this system the foreman exacted bribes with the co-operation of the informal leaders of the workers.

A commonly held view at the time was that IWAs had organised trade unions in shops where there were none, thus resisting the padrone system. But, according to De Witt, 'These claims must be taken with a grain of salt.' Clearly,  an  attempt  at  union  organisation  could  only  be  successful  if  the workers were united and willing to take strike action. This unity of action could not be achieved without the support of the workers' informal leaders.

IWA politicians were particularly hampered in trying to organise unions, since a move in this direction was likely to be viewed as a leader trying to gain prestige within the community. Naturally, a rival would block such an attempt. Ultimately, a pro-union organiser was laid open to the charge that he was not interested in the union itself but in making a personal challenge to the padrones .

Race relations and IWA politics In the summer of 1967, a debate within the Punjabi communities led, on the one hand, by the officers of the IWA-GB Birmingham and, on the other, by the officers of the IWA-Southall, resulted in  disagreement  on  two  related  questions:  who  were  the  enemies  of  the migrants? and what role should the IWAs play in the process of acceptance?

The leaders of the two IWAs agreed that the migrants were threatened by 'racialists' who were to be found not only in extremist movements but also  in  the  Labour  and  Conservative  Parties.  They  also  agreed  that  many 'respectable  politicians'  had  not  done  enough  to  oppose  the  racialists  and cited  the  Commonwealth  Immigration Acts  and  the  Labour  government's White Paper on immigration as examples. They regarded both as racialist documents.  While  both  groups  of  leaders  recognised  that  they  were  also white sympathisers, in the trade union movement and in the VLCs, and felt that  the  Punjabis  should  co-operate  with  them,  they  disagreed  over  the fundamental attitude of the Labour government, and over the stand taken towards the Government, the NCCI and the Labour Party.

The IWA-Southall, though critical of the Labour government, had given loyal  support  to  Labour  candidates  in  elections.  In  1966,  for  example,  its officers advised Punjabis in Southall to vote for the Labour Party candidate but cautioned: 'We ask you (to vote for Labour) despite the deeply critical feelings  most  migrants  hold,  and  which  we  share,  of  some  of  the  Labour government's  legislation.  This  is  particularly  so  in  regards  to  the  White Paper which is racially biased, and which we will fight to get withdrawn.' 69

Moreover, the Southall leaders supported the NCCI  and  CARD (Campaign  Against  Racial Discrimination). In the summer  of  1967, members  of  the  Southall  Executive  Committee  had  begun  to  serve  on Committees of both these organisations, and the IWA-Southall was finally affiliated to CARD. Earlier in the summer of 1966, the IWA-Southall and CARD  were  co-sponsors  of  a  project  which  brought  several  university students to the Southall Punjabi community for several weeks. (More of this

kind of movement towards the grass-roots was sadly lacking in the CARD organisation.)

By contrast, the leaders of the IWA-GB Birmingham Branch, condemned  both  the  Labour  government's  anti-immigration  policy  and racialist foreign policy, stating:

In  July  1962,  the  Government  enacted  legislation  known  as  the Commonwealth Immigrants Act as a measure supposedly designed to  control  immigration,  but  which  in  fact  laid  the  blame  for  the government's failing housing and employment policies at the door of coloured immigrants.

Since  the  racialist  Commonwealth  Immigrant's  Act  had  been enforced race relations in Britain have deteriorated. Racial discrimination has been intensified and racialist organisations have been  encouraged.  Racialism  has  been  used  to  attract  the  voters  in local  and  the  last  two  General  Elections  and  coloured  immigrants have been made the scapegoats. …

The attempts made to improve race relations in Britain were in fact  aimed  at  whitewashing  the  Government's  anti-colour  policy. Under pressure the Race Relations Act was watered down and the freedom to discriminate still remained.

The  setting  up  of  the  NCCI  was  an  attempt  to  misdirect  the activities of many well meaning people. It has attempted to pacify the national minorities 'and their allies' resistance to racialism.

From  a  leaflet  announcing  a  protest  march  and  rally  against  the Commonwealth  Immigrants  Act  in  Birmingham  on  2  July  1967,  the sponsors of the rally were listed as: 'IWA-GB (Birmingham, Coventry and Leamington  branches),  Akali  Party  JK;  CCARD;  CND  West  Midlands Region; Association of Indian Communists GB; Pakistani Workers Association; Pakistani Welfare Association; West Indian WA.'

The meeting was chaired by the Secretary of the IWA-GB, Birmingham branch and most of the audience was Punjabi. 70

Pursuing  this  militant  line,  the  General  Secretary  of  the  Birmingham branch  refused  an  invitation  to  serve  on  a  panel  (subcommittee)  of  the NCCI. Further, the Branch refused to endorse two Labour candidates in the 1966 General Elections and moreover the IWA publicly stated that in the

last  general  election  they  supported  the  Labour  Party  in  the  belief  that,  if elected, they would  remove  the racial basis of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act  of  1962.  But  all  such  hopes  had  been  dashed.  However, they had met two local Labour MPs and questioned them on their present positions vis-à-vis the  assurances  they  gave  before  the  last  election. They were particularly concerned that Roy Hattersley was honest about completely  'changing  his  mind'  and  that  Brian  Walden  was  honest  in admitting the desertion of principles by his Party, but was not prepared to vote against his government. 71

The main area of disagreement then between the IWA-Southall and the IWA-GB, Birmingham was on how best to influence the British to accept the migrants and to eliminate racial discrimination. At least until the end of 1967, the Southall leaders trusted the NCCI and CARD to bring pressure to bear  on  the  government  to  pass  anti-discrimination  legislation.  But  the Birmingham leaders had foreseen the difficulty in this, since by introducing such legislation the Labour Party would run the electoral risk of seeming to favour the migrants. Black migrants and immigration control were the key issues in British politics at the time. In this political climate all parties were likely to shift the blame (as indeed some were actively doing) for Britain's economic difficulties to black migrants. Thus, sympathetic British organisations  and  individuals  paled  into  insignificance  as  the  migrants intensified their own efforts to deal with racial discrimination. In so doing, there were internal problems to overcome.

The Southall leaders criticised this approach of the IWA-GB Birmingham  for  two  reasons:  that it ignored the real possibility of influencing the Labour government through the NCCI and CARD and that by  insisting  on  militancy  it  alienated  many  prominent  Punjabis  and  thus split the Punjabi communities.

In  reply,  the  Birmingham  leaders  interpreted  the  Southall  leaders' arguments as the excuses of opportunists concerned with securing prestigious posts for themselves on inter-racial committees. By doing this, they were ignoring the real interests of the migrants and thereby dividing the Punjabis.

Since both groups were concerned with Punjabi unity, perhaps the best way  to  reflect  their  differences  was  to  categorise  them  as  'militants'  and 'moderates'. Not surprisingly, this neat division was contested by some of the Southall leaders who argued that there was no difference between their

militancy  and  that  of  the  Birmingham  leaders,  but  that  theirs  was  not directed  towards  friendly  Whites.  While  clear-cut  militant  and  moderate positions  had  developed,  there  was  as  yet  no  national  polarisation  along these lines.

By the end of 1967, it was obvious that the IWA-GB, Birmingham was the  only  IWA  in  Britain  to  have  taken  all  these  militant  positions.  One reason  advanced  for  this  militancy  was  the  possibility  that  race  relations was worse in the Birmingham area than anywhere else in Britain. 72

Given the stage of development reached between 1967 and 1968, it was not clear whether the Birmingham leaders would be able to build a national militant movement. While most Punjabis recognised that racial discrimination existed (indeed they were the victims) they had managed to ignore  it.  The  cumulative  effect  of  unexpressed  resentment  was  building into  a  highly  combustible  element  in  British  industrial  relations,  as  racial disadvantage at work became increasingly unbearable. Thus, much of the attention of Asian workers shifted to their common problems (as a group), from  the gurdwaras and  the  IWAs  as  the  major  organisations  of  Punjabi workers until 1967, to the struggles of the Asian workers' experience which brought  about  a  greater  degree  of  militancy  among Asian  workers  as  the 1960s  ended  and  the  1970s  began.  Generally,  the  IWAs  retained  their insular role of 'social work' and personal influences were being superseded as young militant workers became the vanguard of the struggle; a struggle focused  on  the  workplace  where  Indian,  Pakistani  and  African  Asian workers took an unprecedented and militant stand.

## The Asian workers' struggle and the IWAs, 19681981

## New perspectives on the Asian struggle: the 1970s

It is an established fact that the migrants from India and Pakistan who came to Britain in the late 1950s and early 1960s laboured where the work was tedious,  dangerous,  low  paid  and  quite  hopeless  for  any  person  with initiative  or  talent.  For  example,  at  the  Courtaulds  Red  Scar  Mills  in Preston, a rayon spinning mill, Asians first sought and got jobs in 1956. By 1964,  a  third  of  all  the  workers  at  the  mill  were  Asians.  In  fact,  two

departments were manned entirely by immigrants organised in ethnic work teams under white supervisors.

In Southall, West London, the 350 Asians in 1951 had increased by the mid-1960s  to  12  per  cent  of  the  area's  population.  This Asian  workforce was  in  the  main  employed  in  four  factories.  By  1965,  90  per  cent  of  all unskilled labour at Woolfs' factory was Punjabi Sikh. 73 The introduction of Asian workers in these factories had far-reaching consequences for British industrial relations. At Courtaulds in Preston, and at Woolfs in Southall, the confrontations  between  workers  and  employers  became  significant  in  the history of immigrant labour in Britain. The battles fought in these factories were repeated elsewhere. In time, the pattern of industrial struggle of the Asian workforce was clear. The arrival  of Asian  immigrants  from Africa, during  the  second  phase  of  immigration  in  the  early  1970s  inevitably intensified  the  industrial  conflict  at  these  flashpoints.  At  the  Mansfield Hosiery  Mills  in Loughborough  in  1972,  at  Imperial  Typewriters  in Leicester  in  1974,  and  at  Grunwick  in  1978, Asian  workers,  largely  from African backgrounds (Kenya and Uganda) came out in open rebellion. In effect, they organised against their oppressive employers.

Predictably, profits depended upon long working hours, overtime, low wages, and on constant strategies to step-up production. While profits have always been made from surplus labour value, in the Asian workers' case, this  surplus  of  profits  was  extracted  with  a  ruthlessness  which  the  white labour force would not tolerate. In fact, the Asians went where there was a shortage of white labour willing to accept unduly long hours of work.

This separation of black workers  into the lower  paid and  more demanding  jobs  was  an  integral  part  of  the  'colonial  relationship'  which British  industry  had  established  with  its  new  workforce.  Because  of  this strategy,  in  many  factories  Asian  workers  had  to  contend  with  a  lack  of promotion. In the 1960s, very few Asians found promotion to supervisory posts.  In  many  factories  they  worked  in  gangs  under  the  control  of  one white charge-hand who allocated work, dispensed overtime, recommended the hire and fire of migrant workers and, in many cases, he was prone to take bribes. It is therefore not difficult to imagine the real power he had in playing  off  one  migrant  worker  against  another.  This  'ghettoisation'  of labour  also  led  to  lumping  all Asian  workers  together  regardless  of  their qualifications or background.

It was after the first wave of industrial unrest that the distinctions were created. A separation was made between the 'militants' and the 'moderates'. (Note the separation of the militants in the Birmingham/Midlands area, and the  moderates  in  Southall,  and  between  the  political  activists  and  their followers.) This was being clearly reflected in the IWAs' politics of the late 1960s.  Indeed,  it  was  in  the  industrial  struggle  that  management  realised that  Pakistanis  and  Indians  had  political  allegiances  which  may  keep  one section working while the other was on strike.

## The IWAs in the 1970s and 1980s

During the 1960s, the IWAs played an instrumental part especially in the early  years  of  the  struggle.  In  many  instances,  it  supported  shopfloor revolts, and pronounced and demonstrated on issues affecting the immigrant Asian population. However, its intervention as a positive force in the newly emerging independent movement of black workers was severely restricted in  that  its  mass  base  was  confined  to  Punjabi  workers.  Moreover,  the inherent  splits  in  its  political  allegiances,  along  lines  of  fracture  in  the Indian political scene, made it an unacceptable vehicle for the struggles of Asians  from  the African  continent  who  had  entered  the  British  industrial scene in the 1970s. Furthermore, it was unacceptable to the young Asians who were born or were growing up in Britain.

The IWA had been unable to accommodate the demands of Asian youth in Britain. As a political and industrial force, the IWAs peaked in the mid and  late  1960s.  In  the  1970s,  it  inevitably  began  to  degenerate  into  the position of mediator and into 'downright conservative leadership - seeking reaction'. 74 Because of the essential nature of its activities, there was hardly any need to apply foresight to establishing an independent Asian struggle in Britain.  Instead,  the  main  associations  tended  to  hark  back  to  India, ignoring the immediate problems of Asian workers in Britain.

As the  number  of  strikes  in  the  Birmingham  area  increased,  the  IWA (Marast-Lerninists)  led  by  Jagmohan  Joshi  were  called  upon  to  provide leadership  in  the  industrial  struggle.  In  doing  so,  these  radicals  'out  of courage, vision and necessity' were able to incorporate the emerging Black Power  ideology  that  was  generating  militant  revolutionary  organisation among young West Indians and Africans. 75  For some of the IWA activists, Black Power was somewhat difficult to accept. This was surprising since their leadership seemed to champion it. There were, however, connections

between the IWA and the Black Panther Movement, the Black Unity and Freedom Party and other black groups.

In 1971 when the Black Panther Movement  called a National Conference on the Rights of Black People at Alexandra Palace in London, the  IWA  sent  a  'grudging  delegation'  which  arrived  in  a  coach  from Birmingham.

The disappointed delegation returned to Birmingham. As an essentially Asian organisation, they were willing to co-operate with West Indians under the  political  label  'black',  but  since  there  was  no  analysis  of  imperialism and  no  ideological  denunciation  of  the  Soviet  Union,  they  could  not participate. Indeed, they had the confidence of having organised a conference of militants from the factories in the Midlands who had been on strike during the previous two years. After this, they did not make common cause  with  the  West  Indian  organisations  for  some  time  except  when delegations  from  both  communities  met  to  demonstrate  against  the  antiimmigration legislations in London in 1968 and in 1970. By the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, however, Afro-Asian solidarity was much  in  evidence.  On  these  occasions  the  solidarity  was  impressive: coaches came from Birmingham and contingents set out from Brixton and Notting  Hill  to  denounce  the  Wilson  government  as  racist.  The  most massive of these demonstrations was against the Kenyan Asian Bill which was passed by the Labour government in record time.

Elsewhere, in Leicester 4000 marched against Callaghan's Bill. Indeed, the  IWA  (predominantly  the  CP  Marxist  wing)  was  the  motive  force mobilising  the  Asian  community  and  bringing  together  the  student  and organised  left-wing  sections  of  white  society.  The  Whites  marched  under the  banners  of  the  Communist  Party,  the  International  Socialists  and  as trade  union  officials,  obviously  not  reflecting  rank  and  file  feeling.  The West Indians, in a minority, followed the Black Power groups. Finally, in the  demonstrations,  the Asians  forming  the  largest  community  groupings from Birmingham, Southall, Leamington Spa, Derby, Coventry and Leicester, followed the banners of the IWA.

Historically, the IWA (in spite of supportive action) was never the prime moving militant force in any industrial struggle. For example, in the 1960s only after workers had initiated action to confront management by joining their trade  unions  (and  demanding  representation)  did  the  IWA  offer assistance.  By  the  1970s,  with  the  settlement  of  the  African  Asians,  on

whose  behalf  the  IWA  had  demonstrated  and  agitated,  a  new  force confronted and challenged them. In fact, the IWA gave this new workforce minimal  support,  and  in a few  cases, 'blundered  into opposing  the impatience and independence of this new battalion on the Asian industrial front'. 76

## The struggle of African Asians

Most African Asians  who  arrived  in  Britain  became  labourers  in  British factories  and  in  a  few  years  of  militant  action  changed  the  course  of  the Asian  workers'  struggle.  Although  new  to  the  discipline  of  factory  shift work, through their heightened awareness of exploitation and racial injustice, they carried through the industrial struggles of Mansfield Hosiery Mills in Loughborough in 1973, the Imperial Typewriters strike in Leicester in 1974 and the Grunwick strike in Willesden during 1976-1977.

A  significant  feature  of  these  struggles  was  that  large  numbers  of women who had not previously done a day's paid labour outside the home were forced by economic necessity to seek employment in factories. They filled  the  labour-vacuum  created  in  jobs  abandoned  by  white  workers.  In these struggles, the Asian workers initiated the action and then approached their unions for official help. Their causes posed many challenges to British working class solidarity.

## The Standing Conference of West Indian Organisations

The  West  Indian  Standing  Conference  (hereafter  referred  to  as  Standing Conference or Conference) was formed as a result of the impetus of the race 'riots'  in  Nottingham  and  in  Notting  Hill  in  1958.  These  disturbances brought to the fore the fact that race relations in Britain were deteriorating and prejudice and discrimination were widespread. This had repercussions on the High Commission of the newly Federated Government of the West Indies.  The  Migrant  Services  Division  of  the  Commission,  through  its Community  Development  Section  felt  that  West  Indians  in  London  and throughout  Britain,  faced  general  problems  requiring  collective  action. Accordingly, two Community Development officers (Edward Burke and Ms Gregory) came to London  from the West Indies. They worked in

conjunction with officers of the Migrant Services Division to bring together leaders  of  West  Indian  social,  religious  and  cultural  groups,  to  start 'Standing Conference'. 77

In  1959  Standing  Conference  under  the  control  of  High  Commission officers met.  Thereafter, its work  was  'inspired'  by  the  help  of  the Community Development officers. By the end of that year, a constitution was prepared and representatives from the constituent unions elected their leaders.

The  aims  and  objects as provided in the constitution were  that Conference was established to be a channel of communication between the existing West Indian organisations in the London region and between these organisations and the High Commission; to develop leadership among the West  Indian  community  and  to  help  these  leaders  with  organisational problems,  and  to  foster  integration  and  improve  relations  between  the races. 78

Each  organisation affiliated to Standing Conference  had  its own constitution, functions, executive committee and sources of revenue. By the middle of 1961, eighteen organisations had affiliated to Standing Conference. 79

During the early years, however, some tension had existed between the leaders of Standing Conference and the members of the High Commission. The  fact that Burke  and  Gregory  no  longer worked  with  Standing Conference led to misunderstandings between the civil servants in the MSD and  the  Conference  officers.  A  feeling  of  unease  arose  from  a  lack  of recognition  of  the  'independence'  of  Standing  Conference  as  the  High Commission tried to exercise control over the member groups. This factor would continue to preoccupy Conference leaders.

Two events in 1962 caused a significant shift in Conference's position. They were the break-up of the West Indies Federation (after the September 1961  referendum  in  Jamaica  resulting  in  a  move  to  seek  Independence), which  made  redundant  the  High  Commission  and  its  subordinate  bodies, and  the  passage  of  the  Commonwealth  Immigration  Act  which  severely reduced West Indian immigration to Britain. Confronted with these developments,  Conference  was  forced  to  adopt  a  new  programme  of independent action to unite the West Indian community in London.

Whatever belief there was among Standing Conference members in the goodwill  of  British  society  was  weakened  by  both  the  passage  of  the Commonwealth  Immigration  Bill  and  attacks by racialist spokesmen Oswald Mosley and Cyril Osborne. Prejudice and discrimination had to be counteracted, and if 'integration' was to take place it had to be on terms of 'equal partnership'.

This change of mood came after 1962. A few Conference leaders were suspicious,  distrustful  and  angry.  This  generated  increased  pride  among some of Conference's officers, especially Laidlow, Crawford and Maxwell. 80

These  leaders  were  committed  to  making  Conference  an  independent organisation,  free  of  white  participation  on  the  Executive  Committee. Historically,  in  1959,  two  out  of  six  EC  members  were  white.  This  had increased to three out of nine in 1960 when more positions were created; and to four out of nine in 1961 and 1962. The white members had come from the multi-racial organisations affiliated to Conference, during its early life.  At  that  time,  the  inter-racial  aspect  of  Conference  was  considered important. However,  given the changed  mood  of  Conference, white members on the EC thought it best to leave, and after 1963, no 'European' members sat on the Executive Committee.

Furthermore, in this mood of independence, although the new constitution  (rewritten  after  the  collapse  of  the  West  Indian  Federation) urged co-operation with the MSDs  of  all the various West Indian governments, in practice, contact was irregular.

Research work on West Indian immigrants (a thriving industry) aroused suspicion and distrust. Standing Conference fought shy of such observers as those working on the Institute of Race Relations 'Survey of Race Relations' and sharply criticised Sheila Patterson's study of Brixton. 81

Together, the new mood, the different approach to the High Commission and the antipathy towards research formed the background for approaching 'integration' differently. After Notting Hill, the 'tea and bun' approach was no  longer viable. Inter-racial gatherings were  no  substitute for 'real opportunities'.  For  Maxwell  'Integration  must  of  necessity  be  a  game  for two …  each  respecting the other's dignity as a human  being  and recognising merit where it exists - with no reservations'. 82

In  achieving  'equal  partnership',  as  a  basis  for  'integration'  it  was important that  the West  Indian  community  should  develop  its  self-respect and  self-sufficiency.  Tolerance  and  goodwill,  so  far  as  these  went,  were woefully inadequate. Economic development was vital. Towards this end, Maxwell suggested that credit unions, consumer co-operatives, investment societies, housing and business associations should be developed. Politically,  he  urged  West  Indians  to  exert  their  group  influence.  And culturally, development of a sense of 'negritude' was the pre-condition for 'cultural independence'.

One of the major problems facing Standing Conference was inherent in its  structure:  its  dependence  upon  the  affiliated  groups  for  support  and active  participation.  In  effect,  this  placed  constraint  on  decisive  action  by the 'new breed' of Standing Conference officers. These mixed groups had black  and  white  members  and  also  engaged  in  a  range  of  activity.  In  the spring of 1967, six of the fifteen affiliated organisations in 1966 had multiracial membership.  83 Four were regarded as having a mixed membership ranging between 'middle class' and 'working class'; one was 'middle class'; and the rest as 'working class'.

Many of the leading officers were also active in the churches. Indeed, Christian  fellowship  and  worship  constituted  an  integral  part  of  the  West Indian  community.  Thus,  informal  welfare  work  was  accepted  as  part  of their leadership role. They made representations on behalf of individuals, to authorities, landlords and employers. Politics, however, was kept at a safe distance. Although there was a good deal of political discussion, significantly, there was no involvement in voter registration or canvassing.

In  spite  of  the  pronouncements  of  Conference  leaders,  by  1967,  there was little community development or the desired cohesion of organisations for  co-operative  action.  For  example,  the  development  of  economic  goals was  attempted  by  only  three  groups,  and  co-operation  through  antidiscrimination work at regional level was yet to be established. Moreover, these groups showed  no  interest in local council and parliamentary elections, and made little or no effort to register voters or lobby Parliament. They did, however, press for extension of the Race Relations Act.

Given  the  increasing  incidence  of  police  harassment  and  widespread discrimination  in  housing,  it  was  not  surprising  that  Conference  leaders devoted much time attending to individual cases involving the police and landlords. While  their representations were  useful, Conference  could

perform  only  limited  functions; it lacked  a strong organisation with premises  of  its  own,  money  and  a  secretariat.  Consequently,  internal development  of  the  organisation  and  crucial  anti-discrimination work evolved haphazardly.

## Problems of organisation and leadership

A  few  of  Standing  Conference's  leaders  were  acutely  aware  of  the organisational  problems,  due  to  the  federal  structure  of  the  organisation which undermined the group. The lack of commitment  to advance Conference  activities  was  pronounced  and  meant  that  the  predominant groups, essentially 'social in nature', were reluctant to follow the Conference  leaders.  Many  group  leaders  were  reluctant  to  re-orient  their leadership and their groups to problems common to all West Indians.

The dilemma for the Standing Conference leadership was the fact that these  leaders  were  invested  with  the  ultimate  authority  of  Conference. Given the multiplicity of interests of the constituent groups, when Conference was faced with taking action on an important issue such as the union with the Birmingham Conference, it was difficult to reach unanimity.

Apart  from  organising  the  constituent  groups,  Conference  faced  the more general problem of organising West Indians in Britain. Reluctant to admit  the  problem  to  non-West  Indians,  nevertheless  among  themselves they were critical of West Indian apathy. Regional and island conflicts, class and status orientations were especially divisive. 84 In general, these explanations for West  Indian  organisational difficulties suggested  the patterns which frustrated the leaders of Standing Conference. In spite of the historical  difficulties  that  Conference  faced,  the  more  politically-oriented officers were deeply concerned. A number of traits had to be combatted.

Maxwell cited 'The Problems of Individualism'. He argued that it was necessary  to  voluntarily  surrender  'a  little  part  of  one's  freedom  and resources for the preservation and  progress of the whole'. Standing Conference represented in embryo the making of a truly great organisation, but  needed  the  participation  of  the  whole  community. 85 On  'apathy  and leadership' he pinpointed a rejection of leadership and a refusal to support those who were willing to lead.

Maxwell, especially concerned about the 'general low level of organisation  among  West  Indians',  put  forward  several  reasons  for  'this woeful disorganisation'. Firstly, he felt that 'bread and butter issues' took

precedence over people's lives. Consequently, they had little time for group work; secondly, there was a 'lack of awareness of the benefits that can be derived  from  an  organised  community'.  He  attributed  this,  in  part,  to  the narrow  vision  and  the  complacent  attitude  that  (despite  the  difficulties  in Britain) the standard of living might still be slightly higher than in the West Indies.  Far  more  serious,  however,  was  the  'individualism'  or  selfishness with  which  the  West  Indian  was  richly  endowed.  He  made  the  important observation  that  this  'individualism'  had  been  due  to  cynicism  about  the value  of  leaders  and  groups. 86 Moreover,  there  was  a  lack  of  national consciousness.

These traits, fully understood by a few of Conference leaders, became a source  of  frustration.  Clearly  these  leaders  had  to  overcome  formidable obstacles:  to  encourage  self-pride  in  an  oppressed  people  and  develop economic  and  social  strengths.  According  to  Maxwell,  leadership  of  the West  Indian  community  (and  particularly  'Negro  leadership')  at  both national  and  local  levels  required  such  qualities  as  'foresight,  enterprise, tact,  patience,  the  art  of  persuading  others  and  an  absolute  dedication  to Negritude'. 87 More  importantly,  he  added,  leaders  needed  two  special qualities:  independence  of  thought  and  action  and  the  ability  to  identify completely with rank and file West Indians.

The trend of disorganisation had become a central theme consistent with the  theme  of  'Independence'  which  was  always  seen  by  Conference  as  a desirable state, though its implications remained unexplored. The message was  clear:  not  only  would  West  Indians  as  immigrants  have  to  adjust  as strangers to a new society, but at the same time they would have to preserve their self-respect and develop a complex configuration of attitudes, values and beliefs  by  which  they  could  preserve  their  own  individuality. Yet  the problem  for  Conference  leaders  was  to  reach  a  large  number  of  West Indians. However, while 'Negritude' and 'Africanism' suggested a general orientation, it did not directly relate to all West  Indians  in  Britain. Moreover, achieving 'cultural' independence underlined the obvious difficulties  of  eventual  'assimilation'  through  integration.  A  major  factor which inhibited West Indian organisational development in Britain was the duality of West Indian attitudes; that is, should they take part in separate or 'joint' integrated organisations? 88

The problem for Conference was whether West Indians would gain an 'equal place in society' through independence or cooperation with British organisations.  This  remained  unresolved,  reflecting  an  ambivalence  or seriously conflicting views among the officers of Conference. Undoubtedly, it seemed that most of Standing Conference executive committee, from the most active and political to the more conservative, wanted their organisation to be recognised by Englishmen. More than that they wanted to be  independent.  Their  isolation  and  powerlessness  led  to  frustration  and anger.  Thus  what  seemed  like  extreme  behaviour  was  counteracted  by some.  The  less  active  Conference  members  allied  themselves  to  British organisations, hoping to gain acceptance. This dual approach split the ranks and  leadership  of  the  Conference.  The  debilitating  effect  of  this  became evident  when  the  more  active  leaders  of  Conference  joined  the  other immigrant groups to oppose the NCCI while both the Conference executive and  the  delegates'  meeting  voted  to  recognise  the  NCCI.  Therein  lay  the paradox of the powerlessness of Standing Conference.

## Organisation from the top: CARD

## 'The organisation of organisations'

In December  1964  the  Campaign  Against  Racial  Discrimination  was founded 'to speak for a social and political movement that did not exist'. 89 It was designed to bring together disparate black migrant groups in order to press for changes in national policy. Furthermore, CARD was expected to persuade those in power to act in such a way that would benefit those who were  powerless.  CARD's  predecessor,  The  League  of  Coloured  Peoples, had  attempted  to  unify  'coloured'  citizens  in  Britain  before  and  after  the Second  World  War.  Indeed,  it  was  largely  concerned  with  fighting  the colour bar and altering the colonial system.

The  one  million  black  immigrant  population  in  Britain  by  the  mid1960s was divided into three main nationality groups: Indian, Pakistani and West Indian. Their lives were commonly affected by racial discrimination. Many individuals (journalists, academics and MPs) showed concern, but no political organisation or pressure group existed to represent the three main nationalities  to  those  in  power.  The  commonality  of  experience,  and  allpervasive discrimination, the founders of CARD  hoped  would  draw

together Indians, Pakistanis and West Indians to form a strong organisation. CARD would try to change the pattern of public policy at both national and local levels by

eliminating discriminatory legislation (regarding immigration controls); insuring equal opportunity in vital areas like employment and  housing  through  passage  of  an  anti-discrimination  legislation; pressing for broad social and economic policies that would promote social equality for all people in lower income classes; policing the administration of existing social and economic programmes to make sure that immigrants were not adversely affected by them.

Moreover, CARD tried to mobilise, organise and represent immigrants and their children. Thus, CARD had two broad sets of relationships; with those in the immigrant communities and within the immigrant organisations that it wanted to mobilise and with those who had the power necessary for the  alteration  of  public  policy.  In  a  sense,  CARD  attempted  to  become  a 'pressure group'.

Given  that  immigrants  suffered  from  problems  of  race  and  class, CARD's  aims  were  to  defend  the  interest  of  black  immigrants  and  their children against discrimination and to promote the cause of 'general social reconstruction and social equality in Britain by emphasising the need for the public  and  private  sectors  to  provide  better  housing,  jobs,  education, medical care, and other social services for a number of British citizens; not just immigrants'. It was hoped that by advancing the cause of greater social equality  CARD  would  be  able  at  least  to  counter  some  of  the  causes  of discrimination, if not remove them.

In  trying  both  to  promote  a  cause  and  to  represent  an  interest,  CARD was  to  be  a  coalition,  a  union  of  nationalities,  races,  classes,  languages, cultures, religions, and political beliefs. They faced many difficulties. In the formative  period,  the  outline  of  the  organisation  was  by  no  means  clear. However, two things were obvious: legislation against discrimination was necessary  and  organising  and  involving  the  immigrant  in  the  CARD structure  were  imperative.  These  were  the  guidelines  for  the  Campaign Against Racial Discrimination.

Origins

Powerless,  Blacks  in  Britain  continued  to  seek,  through  organisation, redress for their basic grievances. The arrival of Dr Martin Luther King, Jnr. in  London  on  5  December  1964  was  a  significant  event.  On  his  way  to Stockholm  to  receive  the  Nobel  Peace  Prize  for  leadership  of  the  Civil Rights movement in the United States, King preached at St Paul's cathedral and  was  widely  quoted  in  the  British  press.  At  a  meeting  organised  by Canon  John  Collins  of  Christian  Action,  he  spoke  on  American  race relations.  He  warned  of  Britain's  racial  problems  becoming  'tragic  and intractable' if they were not publicised and dealt with.

While in London, he also met 30 Commonwealth immigrants and a few white  sympathisers.  Encouraged,  following  his  departure,  this  immigrant group decided to form an organisation to speak on behalf of all coloured people in Britain. Incidentally, the League of Coloured Peoples founded by the middle-class doctor, Harold Moody in 1933 also had this aim, but it did not  have  a  mass  rank  and  file  following.  This  was  its  weakness.  Would CARD learn from this mistake? In fact, many of the founder members of CARD were of middle class backgrounds whose commitment to the black working  class  was  undoubted.  It  was  understood  that  the  setting  up  of CARD had to  be  initially  a  job  for  professionals  and  intellectuals;  those socially  and  politically  committed  to  the  cause  of  redressing  inequality inherent in the structured racism of British society.

Clearly,  King's  visit  acted  as  a  catalyst,  but  the  impetus  for  the  then unnamed organisation did not emanate from King. In fact, this came from a West Indian, Ms Marion Glean, who was not only a member of the Society of Friends Race Relations Committee, and warden of William Penn House, but also founder of Multi-Racial Britain.

As a Quaker, Glean believed in non-violent direct action. Yet she was not passive. Indeed, she was active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament  and  the  Committee  of  100  and  was  also  concerned  with aspects of British race relations, and the need to build a strong immigrant organisation to combat racial prejudice and discrimination. 90 In this she had the support of the editor of Peace News .

After  the  General  Election,  Glean  saw  Patrick  Walker's  defeat  in Smethwick as a body blow for good race relations and decided to act. She contacted Alan Lovell and Michael Randle (both pacifists and also firmly involved in the Committee of 100) who were interested in helping to found an exclusive organisation. She then contacted several friends: Ranjana Ash

(an active member of the Movement for Colonial Freedom), C. L. R. James (the  distinguished  West  Indian  historian)  and  Barry  Reckord  (the  West Indian playwright and actor). Together, Blacks and Whites, they constituted the informal group called Multi-Racial Britain.

Of crucial significance to MRB was the fact that none of the members were directly connected with the rank and file of the immigrant communities,  through  immigrant  organisations.  However,  Glean, Ash  and James were on friendly terms with many immigrant leaders. In effect, MRB was  essentially  a  'forum  of  debate'.  Indeed,  discussions  at  meetings  and seminars were regular. It was not all talk however. MRB was active through a 'hurriedly organised' lobby of Parliament to oppose the extension of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1962. This failure was instructive to the black members of MRB who felt that contacts made by Lovell and Randle with the CND and the Committee of 100 were not transferable to another group. In fact, it was abundantly clear that Blacks had to organise and act for  themselves;  self-determination  within  the  black  immigrant  community was the most potent way of influencing British politics.

Against this background, Bayard Rustin the black American arrived in London  in  November  1964  to  help  plan  King's  visit.  Through  Michael Randle  of  the  British  Peace  Movement,  Rustin  was  able  to  meet  Marion Glean. They agreed on the need for a broad-based British antidiscrimination  organisation  and  that  King  should  be  used  to  meet  with 'black  faces'  in  promoting  this  end.  Rustin,  Glean,  Randle  and  Roszak agreed that the 'new movement' should be in the hands of immigrants with, of course, the necessary support of Whites.

Unfortunately, plans for the meeting were not put into motion because it was  not  clear  who  was  responsible  for  inviting  immigrants.  Thus,  when King arrived in London on 5 December, it was Glean's responsibility to get a group of people together for a Monday morning discussion. In spite of the short notice given, MRB was able to call together several organisations to attend  its  first  'mass'  meeting.  The  organisations  represented  were  CND, the  Committee  of  100,  the  Movement  for  Colonial  Freedom,  the  Indian Workers' Association  (Southall),  the  Standing  Conference  of  West  Indian Organisations  (London  Region),  the  West  Indian  Students'  Union,  the British  Caribbean Association, Anti-Apartheid,  the  National  Federation  of Pakistani  Associations,  and  the  Council  of  African  Organisations.  Also present was a 'prominent immigrant' Dr David Pitt.

At  the  meeting,  held  at  the  Hilton  Hotel,  King  and  Rustin  urged  the assembled group to fight discriminatory legislation and to bring pressure to bear on the government by uniting in protest. In a BBC interview, the next day, King said:

I think it is necessary for the coloured population in Great Britain to organise  and  work  through  meaningful  non-violent  direct  action approaches to bring these issues to the forefront of the conscience of the nation wherever they exist. You can never get rid of a problem as long as you hide the problem, as long as you complacently adjust yourself to it. 91

King's evangelical style during the meeting had the desired crusading effect as  far  as  Marion  Glean  was  concerned.  Thereafter,  an ad  hoc committee was  set  up  to  serve  as  a  'nucleus'  for  an  'umbrella'  organisation  to  coordinate the anti-discrimination efforts of immigrant organisations representing their communities. This 'nucleus' avoided organisations on the militant civil rights model. The militancy alluded to was in the context of a group willing to protest through direct action.

A  second  formal  meeting  of  the  CARD  'nucleus'  was  held  on  20 December  at  Glean's  house.  Of  the  eighteen  people  attending,  Michael Randle  was  the  only  white  person  -  a  non-immigrant.  The  meeting established  two  sub-committees  for  policy  finances  and  the  legislative campaign. In view of the need for legislation and because the government was planning to introduce a Bill of its own, the task of the legislative subcommittee was vital.

At  another  meeting,  held  on  10  January  1965,  attended  by  33  people (about  one-third  representing  immigrant  groups)  the  name  'Campaign Against Racial Discrimination' was officially adopted. There was a dominant  London  presence  among  those  attending  the  meeting.  One estimate put the number of Whites at 'about a sixth', among whom was the Englishman Anthony Lester, a young barrister. His expertise and experience was invaluable.  Fortuitously  he  sat  on  a  Society  of  Labour  Lawyers  subcommittee  concerned  with  drafting  anti-discrimination  legislation  for  the Labour Party's National Executive.

One of the meeting's main tasks was to formulate and adopt the aims and objects of CARD and to choose an Executive Committee pro tem . After

the votes for the Executive Committee were counted, David Pitt and Marion Glean emerged at the top. During this crucial meeting, the sharp debate was on  the  fundamental  question  of  how  far  the  new  organisation  should  cooperate with existing organisations and institutions in Britain. What emerged  was  'general  distrust'  of  the  Labour  Party  because  it  failed  to clarify  the  need  for  strong  anti-discriminatory  legislation.  Marion  Glean argued  strongly  against  'working  closely'  with  the  Labour  Party  and  the trade unions. And David Pitt (a staunch Labour Party supporter) asked for the  'enlistment  of  allies  among  the  more  sympathetic  elements  of  British society'. Following this debate, a set of aims and objects were adopted. 92

It was proposed that a national founding Convention should be held in July  1965. The  idea  was  that  CARD  'must  prove  itself  through  activities before  seeking  formal  recognition  from  Commonwealth  immigrants  and British sympathisers'. During the early days CARD developed haphazardly around  the  idea  of  opposition  to  racial  discrimination  in  Great  Britain. Clearly,  CARD  had  to  learn  from  similar  organisations  and  civil  rights groups,  both  in  Britain  and  the  United  States.  While  there  were  many disagreements among those involved, CARD lacked a clear programme.

## Working towards an organisation

The Executive Committee's role was crucial in the history of CARD. Those elected  were  David  Pitt  as  chairman;  Victor  Page  (a  West  Indian  dentist who  had  been  co-opted)  as  treasurer;  Ranjana  Ash,  recording  secretary; Selma James, organising secretary; Richard Small, press officer; Anthony Lester, chairman of the legal sub-committee.

In  the  following  weeks,  the  Executive  Committee  was  increased  by seven  members:  a  place  reserved  for  the  Standing  Conference  of  West Indian Organisations was taken by the group's vice-chairman, Mrs Frances Ezzreco; another, reserved for a Pakistani representative Alam Ir Kabir. In addition, there were five co-options. Page, Hamza Alavi (a businessman and member  of  the  National  Federation  of  Pakistani  Associations)  and  Kojo Amoo-Gottfried  (past  president  of  the  Council  of  African  Organisations) were  immigrants.  In  an  attempt  to  broaden  CARD's  appeal  to  liberal Englishmen,  at  Pitt's  suggestion,  Nicholas  Deakin  (then  Director  of  the 'Survey of Race Relations' and Roy Shaw (business executive and former manager of Pitt's Hampstead election campaign) were also included. 93

After  CARD  became  operational,  the  legal  sub-committee  (which included  Lester)  and  two  West  Indian  law  students,  Small  and  Fitzroy Bryant,  formulated  legislative  proposals.  These  proposals  were  met  with 'sharp  disagreement'  among  members  of  the  Executive.  Ultimately  the question was put to the full CARD membership. During this time, CARD held  a  series  of  monthly  meetings  at  Conway  Hall,  London.  At  the membership meeting of 27 June, of the 95 in attendance 90 were from the London area. Clearly at this stage, CARD was essentially a London-based organisation. This imbalance did not detract from the focus of the debate.

In February 1965, it was resolved that 'CARD is opposed to all forms of racial discrimination and calls for legislation as one means of fighting it'. 94 Later,  a  public  meeting  held  on  20  February  called  for  support  for  broad anti-discrimination  laws  and  to  launch  CARD  into  British  politics.  The main formal record of the developing conception of organisation was found in  a  series  of  'Statements  of  Future  Work'  prepared  in  April  by  Selma James,  Marion  Glean,  Ranjana  Ash  and  Nicholas  Deakin;  also  in  three different  drafts  of  a  'Summary  of  Future  Work'  statement  which  was distributed at the Founding Convention in July, and an essay on the CARD constitution prepared by Hamza Alavi.

According to Heineman, each of the various memoranda was characterised  by  an  awareness  of  the  need  for  conceptual  clarity  and stressed the lack of information. And each mentioned the need for careful planning  and  careful  thought  to  deal  with  complex  problems  and  manyfaceted communities.

Marion Glean emphasised that CARD should not become so concerned with  legal  problems  that  it  lost  sight  of  creating  a  strong  organisation. Citing the experience of Blacks in the United States she argued:

CORE  [the  Congress  of  Racial  Equality]  and  SNICK  [sic]  [The Student Non-Violent Co-ordinating Committee] were revolts against the old coloured, legalistic bourgeoisie of the NAACP [the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People]… It would be a pity if CARD became the NAACP equivalent in Britain. 95

Most of these writers of various memoranda, clearly outraged by discrimination  in  Britain,  were  not  experienced  rank-and-file  organisers. They  were  aware  of  the  distance  between  themselves  and  immigrant

workers, the local communities and many immigrant organisations. There were, however, two exceptions. Ranjana Ash and Selma James were closely in  touch  with  the  Indian  Workers'  Association-Great  Britain  and  with Standing Conference, London Region, respectively. They both wanted these organisations  to  join  CARD.  However,  the  elitists  among  the  Executive Committee (feeling a shade threatened) came out in the open. Hamza Alavi felt  that  it  was  perhaps  'too  early  to  hope  that  an  organisation  can  be brought into  existence  in  which  the  entire  rank  and  file  of  the  immigrant communities  take  part  directly'.  The  multiplicity  of  'images'  that  were conjured up did not systematically develop into strategies for 'joining the immigrants or gaining power'. Indeed, none were used as a premise from which  a  coherent  conception  of  CARD  could  be  developed.  In  this imprecise way the organisation limped on.

Among  the  activities  engaged  in  was  the  Parliamentary  lobby.  The concurrent  discussions  about  the  development  of  CARD  and  about  its activities  were  both  characterised  by  an  uneasy  consensus.  Significantly, between  the  adoption  of  the  name  CARD  on  10  January  1965  and  the Founding  Convention  in  late  July,  CARD  was  active  in  two  areas  only: lobbying  for  amendments  to  the  Race  Relations  Bill  and  building  up  the organisation. The Bill was not introduced until 7 April, but CARD members had  correctly  predicted  that  it  would  not  be  adequate  in  two  important respects:  scope  and  means  of  enforcement.  The  proposals  approved  by CARD urged extension of the law to housing, employment, insurance and credit facilities and asked for a change in the method of enforcement so that criminal sanctions would be based only as a last resort following conciliation efforts, a civil action, and a contempt order from the final court.

Throughout the founding period, Pitt  and  Lester,  the  legal  Committee members and Small as press officer, spent much time in putting CARD's views to  the  government  and  the  public.  In  addition,  a  petition  campaign was  started  to  'muster  enough  support  to  convince  the  government  to amend  their  proposals  to  our  requirements'.  Accordingly,  20,000  forms were printed and a target of one million signatures was set. The petition was essentially  Pitt's  idea.  He  felt  it  would  serve  two  functions:  it  would  be palpable pressure in support of CARD's legislative proposals and it would allow CARD to canvass at local level and make itself known to immigrants.

The  petition,  a  failure,  was  never  presented  to  the  government,  as intended.  This  failure  was  attributable  in  part,  to  the  'lukewarm'  CARD

leadership  and  partly,  because  the  CARD  office  was  not  efficient  in  coordinating the efforts of the inherently weak immigrant organisations. This unfruitful  relationship  between  CARD  and  the  immigrant  groups  it  was intended to help, was a portent of things to come.

CARD's other activities did not require major policy decisions. Money was raised and the membership drive continued sporadically. By June 1965, 400  people  had  joined  and  28  organisations  had  affiliated  and  agreed  to support  CARD's  aims  and  objects.  CARD  also  supported  striking  Indian and Pakistani workers at Courtaulds Preston plant, submitted a memorandum on 'Racial Discrimination in Great Britain' specially for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in June, laid plans for the July Founding Convention, and had written and discussed CARD's constitution. 96 Significantly, there was little concern over the allocation of CARD's inadequate resources.

A verbal war ensued concerning the 'issues'. The first six months from January to June 1965 developed into a 'nightmare situation' with meetings and  discussions  marked  by  severe  factionalism  and  bitter  in-fighting. Personal attacks hampered the Executive Committee, while mass meetings often  resulted  in  'embarrassing  acrimony'  between  Executive  Committee members. There were endless doctrinal battles as accusations and counteraccusations  were  made.  So  much  so  that  a  month  before  the  Founding Convention, the organisation was stationary. The tensions revealed a clear picture: the organisation was split into two factions, the effective working majority  and  the  dissidents.  The  working  majority  included  Pitt,  Lester, Deakin,  Shaw,  Singh,  Alavi  and  Page.  The  dissidents  were  Small,  Ash, James, Glean and Ezzreco. Glean had left CARD in February 1965 to work in Paris for the United Nations. Except for Small, the core of the dissident group  were  women. As  the  working  majority  saw  it,  CARD  was  divided into 'realists' and 'romantics', while the dissidents saw this division as one between  'militants'  and  'moderates'.  Thus,  there  was  an  ongoing  conflict between the left-wing and those in the left of centre of British politics. On balance,  both  groups  had  little to do  with  the  reality of organising immigrants. In effect, they used some of the arguments in CARD to grind their own axes.

Paradoxically,  although  there  were  deep  divisions  within  CARD  in terms of style, rhetoric and political beliefs, 'these differences were never directly manifested in divisions over specific, explicit proposals for action'.

However, both factions were agreed on establishing CARD  in  the immigrant  communities  and  to  amend  the  proposed  Race  Relations  Bill. Each  faction  became  identified  with  one  of  these  issues.  The  dissidents concentrated on developing CARD as a group, while the working majority was  associated  with  the  government's  proposed  legislation.  There  was, however, a 'fundamental confusion' in both groups as to what type of power CARD should have and how it would go about gaining that power.

Although they were essentially middle class in terms of occupation and education, the dissidents were emphatic in establishing an essentially rank and file organisation of immigrants which would be 'strong and independent' and in control without the domination of Whites or by middle class.  On  the  other  hand,  the  working  majority  had  more  immediate concerns. They wanted a strong CARD organisation, but were conscious of their  lack  of  power  and  the  need  for  allies.  To  them,  amending  the  Race Relations Bill was a first step in shaping race relations in Britain.

Moreover,  the  two  groups  were  separated  by  other  issues  such  as whether  immigrants  should  not  politely  show  they  were  for  equality,  but angrily  oppose  discrimination.  In  addition,  there  was  bitter  debate  during the  early  days  as  to  whether  CARD's  first  aim  and  object  should  express opposition to prejudice and discrimination directed at all minority groups or just prejudice and discrimination practised on the basis of colour. This was an extremely important issue for the dissidents who feared that Whites and moderates would play down the need to combat colour discrimination for fear of alienating liberal opinion.

Another  issue  disputed  by  the  two  factions  was  the  Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. The two issues involved on this question were firstly, whether CARD should state its aims and objects in opposition to the Act and  express  a  desire  for  its  repeal;  and  secondly,  whether  a  resolution should also be approved criticising the 1962 Act. The left-wing group felt that  CARD,  as  an  organisation  founded  to  combat  racial  discrimination should  publicly  oppose  this  discriminatory Act  and  demand  its  repeal.  In striking  contrast,  Pitt,  Lester,  and  Deakin  felt  opposition  to  the  Act  in January 1965 was pointless. They had a point, for race was not a flexible issue  in  British  politics.  Indeed  it  had  become  an  entrenched  part  of  the British state control and would so reveal itself as time wore on. Therefore the  government  was  unlikely  to  change  its  policy  on  immigration  lightly.

Thus, the three moderates felt that CARD  should press for antidiscrimination legislation instead.

The  division  between  the  militants  and  moderates  in  CARD  was  a distinction  relevant  only  in  terms  of  the  desire  of  one  group  to  appear militant,  and  of  the  other  group  to  appear  moderate  or,  more  accurately, reasonable, technically proficient, knowledgeable,  responsible. 97 These differences  were  based  on  differing  immediate  goals  (for  example,  to organise and to amend legislation) and on the expectations that each group had about people who were central to the achievement of these objectives.

To  compound  CARD's  problems  there  was  no  individual  leader  who could  command  individual  respect.  Moreover,  the  debate  on  how  to organise never really developed, and foundered on the stark fact that neither group had much, if any, experience in organising at grass-roots level or in building a strong organisation among  the people. Clearly, CARD's formative  period  was  bedevilled  by  division,  polarisation  and  paralysis which had particularly destructive effects. The period of sharp disagreement demonstrated that in a multi-racial, multi-nationality coalition, debilitating factionalism could obstruct the work of the organisation even before such work began to reveal divisions based on real choices about the present. But as  the  'verbal  war'  raged,  drawing  the  energies  and  concentration  of  the participants,  attention  was  deflected  from  the  main  issue  facing  CARD. Thus  the  central question  of power  was  avoided  in  a  confusion  of promotional  and  sectional  roles.  In  their  frustration,  attacking  each  other forcefully was easier for both factions than tackling the essential problems of developing influence and facing the reality of powerlessness. 98

## Constitution and convention

Not  surprisingly,  the  constitution  was  symbolic  of  the  confusions  and contradictions with which CARD struggled during the formative period. In essence,  the  constitution's  authors  attempted  to  combine  provisions  for  a federal structure ('an organisation of organisations') with a role for individual mass membership, not necessarily based on the membership of immigrant organisations. It also tried to reconcile the idea of central control with the need for membership participation in the organisation, and hoped that  a  large  measure  of  support  would  come from organisations that were themselves directly involved in the same field of work.

The Annual Conference was to have two types of delegate: representatives from affiliated organisations (the number depending on the size  of  the  organisation);  and  individual  members.  The Annual  Delegates Conference was presumably the highest policy-making body in CARD. The Conference's  main  functions  were  to  elect  a  Chairman  and  a  National Council.

The CARD chairman was head of the National Council, the members of which elected a vice-chairman, secretary and treasurer, all of whom sat with the  chairman  on  the  Executive  Committee.  It  also  selected  the  Executive Committee's other 10 members from within its own ranks.

To function properly CARD had to have an elaborate bureaucracy. The Executive  Committee  would  effectively  run  the  organisation,  since  the National  Council  would  meet  only  four  times  a  year.  Significantly,  the participation  of  individual  members  of  the  immigrant  communities  was made  'extremely  difficult'.  The  structure  was  such  that  it  would  be cumbersome  to  call  area  conferences  and  send  delegates  to  the  Annual Conference. The number of such delegates was limited. Individual delegates were eligible for election only to 15 of the 45 National Council seats.

While the dissidents had shown their displeasure, they themselves were unclear  as  to  how  'immigrants  were  going  to  be  mobilised  on  their  own behalf'. Thus, given their commitment to the existing immigrant organisations  and  the  active  participation  of  individual  immigrants,  they were unhappy about the constitution, but sadly they did not know how to amend or reconstruct it. Thus, when the National Founding Convention was held in Conway Hall on 24-25 July 1965, there was very little attempt to change the tentative structure suggested by the constitution committee and approved  by  the  Executive  Committee.  The  Convention  was  attended  by 230  individual  CARD  members  and  100  delegates  or  observers  from affiliated organisations. After six months in existence, CARD claimed 400 individual members and 31 affiliated organisations. Any paid member was eligible to vote. Attendance at the two-day Convention fluctuated between 200 and 300. And while there were no precise figures, it was estimated that roughly half of those present were black and half white. The constitutional structure was accepted without much trouble and a number of resolutions were passed.

After  the  Convention  the  dissidents  departed  and  Pitt,  the  Chairman supreme,  was  unrivalled  as  the  leading  immigrant  in  CARD.  He  had become the leading black spokesman in Britain. There was a sense of relief with  the election of a New  National  Council  and  a  new  Executive Committee that was less divided. 99  On balance, the general description of CARD's Executive Committee as 'middle class', 'intellectual' and 'professional' held as well with the second EC as with the first. The main change was that divisions did not arise  in  discussions  with  the  frequency that characterised the meetings during the formative period. It seemed that the  work  of  the  organisation  would  be  able  to  continue  without  the  bitter feuding,  and  that  the  essential  anti-discrimination  work  and  organisationbuilding was about to begin.

Was CARD a parliamentary pressure group? Soon after the Founding Convention in August 1965, the Labour government introduced its policy statement,  a  White  Paper  on  immigration  from  the  Commonwealth.  This White  Paper  discussed  future  immigration  control  policy.  In  essence,  it proposed a tightening of the existing discriminatory measures written into the  Commonwealth  Immigration  Act  1962.  Predictably,  this  was  bitterly attacked  for  continuing  and  strengthening  the  existing  measures  and  for introducing  new  powers  of  detainment  and  deportation. This  was  seen  as giving  the  government  dangerous  arbitrary  authority. 100 The  government gave its blessings on the work of the Commonwealth Immigrants Advisory Council and the NCCI; bodies which could not be said to have helped the process of better race relations.  Like  the  Royal  Commissions which were set up to look into colonial matters (usually after working class unrest in the colonies)  these  official  bodies  were  essentially  concerned  with  enquiry. Whereas the Royal Commissions reported on the workers in the colonies, the CIAC now reported on them as immigrants, 'colonised' in Britain.

The  White  Paper  posed  two  problems  for  CARD.  Firstly,  because CARD had  failed  to  amend  the  Race  Relations  Bill  and  was  anxious  to work towards a further extension of anti-discrimination laws, it was forced to  turn  its  attention  to  preventing  the  proposed  tightening  of  immigration controls.  Secondly,  the  setting  up  of  the  NCCI  meant  a  broadening  of  its membership base; thus CARD had to decide whether or not to co-operate with  this  semi-official  body.  Not  surprisingly  therefore,  before  there  was any  discussion,  a  decision  was  taken  for  CARD.  David  Pitt  and  Hamza Alavi announced their acceptance of invitations from the Prime Minister to

become members of the NCCI. The result was renewed 'recriminations and disputes' within CARD. The organisation was confronted with two crucial issues:  should  members  of  CARD  co-operate  with  and  participate  in  a committee  established  by  a  document  which  approved  (and  proposed  to extend) discriminatory immigration policy? Moreover, should CARD Executive  Committee  members  make  such  important  decisions  without referring back to the National Council for advice?

In defence Pitt and  Alavi argued that although the NCCI  was reconstituted in a document which perpetuated a discriminatory government policy, nonetheless the Committee's functions were geared towards improving  race  relations  and  formulating  a  more  enlightened  internal policy. Both men argued that they were joining the NCCI in their 'personal capacities';  therefore  there  was  no  need  to  consult  the  National  Council. One might well ask: would they have been invited to sit on the National Committee if they were not influential members of CARD? The fears of the dissidents were realised.

Unfortunately,  a  new  and  bitter  argument  engulfed  CARD  as  new dissidents  and  new  alliances  emerged.  Although  the  debate  lasted  for several months, CARD's final position towards the NCCI was postponed. Given this breathing space, Pitt and Alavi began attending meetings; and a number of CARD Executive Committee members joined specialist panels of the NCCI. Thus drawn into government machinery, CARD's subsequent role was predictable. CARD's fight for 'independence' had ended with the dissidents  in  disarray.  The  organisation  was  now  increasingly  concerned with the formation of public policy, within government guidelines.

Thus,  the  formative  period  had  ended,  and  CARD  began  routine operations under its new constitution. In a promotional sense, the 'national pressure group' idea took precedence.

## The collapse of CARD

## The withdrawal of Standing Conference

The decision taken by Pitt and Alavi to join the NCCI had profound effects not only within CARD's Executive but also resulting in the withdrawal of Standing Conference of West  Indian Organisations from the CARD structure.  (Hereafter,  Standing  Conference  would  refer  to  the  London

regional  organisation,  not  the  Standing  Conference  for  the  Birmingham region.)

In October, the Standing Conference Executive Committee decided that either Pitt and Alavi should resign from the NCCI or Standing Conference would disaffiliate from CARD. Given CARD's public commitment to the NCCI, Conference's stand was an effective announcement of disaffiliation. This formal step was confirmed in Feburary 1966 in a vote of the general monthly meeting of Standing Conference. 101

The withdrawal of the West Indian organisation, symbolised the failure of the 'organisation of organisations' idea (cherished by Pitt) to be binding and to exist as a successful strategy through which CARD could unite those groups in a campaign against racial discrimination. This dual focus of the idea was to bring in all British organisations sympathetically disposed to the immigrants'  cause,  and  to  bring  in  all  existing  immigrant  organisations. This second function, considered by far the most important task by many CARD members, had failed from the start.

The  organisation  of  organisations  idea  envisioned  that  CARD  would have three types of relationship with the existing groups. Firstly, it would co-ordinate  efforts  already  launched  against  discrimination;  secondly,  it would  act  as  a  clearing  house  for  information;  and  thirdly,  it  would participate in organising and initiating further efforts to eradicate discrimination.

Clearly, both at national and local level CARD needed to mobilise and develop  organised  power.  Members  of  the  CARD  Executive  Committee were  aware  that  the  immigrant  communities  were  not  particularly  well organised  and,  more  importantly,  that  immigrants  were  not  involved  in groups dedicated to improving their life in Britain.

To achieve cohesion, it was hoped that the 'consent and participation' of the  Pakistanis,  Indian  and  West  Indian  national  group  structures  (for example, the IWA, the NFPA and Standing Conference) would help local development  and  increase  participation  and  organisation  building  at  that level.  Thus,  through  these  developments,  CARD  would  amalgamate  and strengthen the concentration of immigrant organisations.

This strategy failed both to indicate the kinds of difficulty that CARD had  in  developing  as  an  organisation  and  to  explain  the  nature  of  the

internal constraints which hindered CARD's effective operation as a force against discrimination.

CARD's relationship  with  Standing  Conference  and  the  difficulties  in establishing  relations  with  the  Indian  Workers'  Association'Great  Britain and  the  National  Federation  of  Pakistani  Associations  during  the  period 1965-7 was revealing.

## CARD and the Standing Conference of West Indian Organisations

Although the Standing Conference of West Indian Organisations' London Region  was  among  the  first  groups  to  affiliate  with  CARD,  it  did  so reluctantly.  There  was  deep  concern  among  members  of  the  Conference Executive (Vernon Laidlow, chairman; Mrs Frances Ezzreco, vicechairman; Jeff Crawford, secretary; and Neville Maxwell, welfare officer) about  the  implications  of  joining  the  newly  formed  anti-discrimination group. They were, however, keenly interested in the possibilities of CARD. Members of Standing Conference attended all CARD meetings after King's visit to London. At the 10 January 1965 organisational meeting, Crawford was asked to serve on the CARD Executive protem . He declined this offer not only because he lacked the time but also because he had serious doubts about  CARD. So concerned was Crawford that he and other members of Conference discussed these matters with Pitt at  a  special  meeting  held  in February at Pitt's surgery in Gower Street, London. 102

The Standing Conference delegation wanted assurances from Pitt  that individual  membership  would  not  be  allowed  to  outweigh  (for  example, outvote) the membership of the affiliated organisations. Further, Conference needed assurances that CARD would not be 'white-dominated'. Indeed they could only accept a CARD run and controlled by immigrants. Pitt did not concede  this,  but  explained  that  Whites  had  a  useful  role  to  play  in  the organisation. Eventually, after discussing the nature of white involvement, Standing Conference and Pitt agreed that, in general, Whites would not run the  organisation  but  should  play  a  supporting  role  in  the  fight  against discrimination.  Finally,  Ezzreco,  Crawford,  Maxwell  and  Laidlow  asked that CARD be 'militant' in publicly opposing discriminatory practices and in  its  efforts  to  counter  them. They  also  insisted  that  CARD should in no way be tied to the Labour Party.

For some eight months, Standing Conference was formally associated with CARD, but interestingly it had little involvement in the activities of

the organisation. Of the two places offered to Conference on the Executive Committee, only one was filled by Frances Ezzreco, whose attendance at Executive meetings was  irregular. Nevertheless, Standing Conference supported CARD's proposals to amend the Race Relations Bill and attended conferences before and after the National Founding Convention to discuss the aims and objects of CARD. In spite of this show of concern, a place for it  on  the  committee  drafting  the  constitution  remained  vacant.  Standing Conference was not particularly interested in helping CARD. In this sense, the Conference members, Crawford, Maxwell, Laidlow and Ezzreco, were fundamentally  different from  their colleagues in CARD,  namely  the 'dissidents', Small, Glean, Ash, and Selma James. For a number of reasons, some of which they shared with the dissidents, Conference members were extremely suspicious of CARD. Given that they were uncertain of their role within CARD, this wariness was understandable.

Bitter  personal  attacks  at  pre-Founding  Convention  meetings  on  the dissidents led to a strong dislike of CARD among Conference members so that by the time of the National Founding Convention this bitterness within CARD was already well-known among Conference leadership who saw the new organisations as being 'middle class, white-dominated, moderate and controlled by the Labour Party'. This was in line with the thinking of the CARD dissidents.

One of the most outspoken dissidents, Selma James, was the Conference's  closest  ally.  When  she  failed  to  be  elected  to  the  Executive Committee by the National Council, following the Convention, Conference became suspicious and thus further alienated. They felt that David Pitt was wheeling and dealing behind the scenes. For them, the last straw was Pitt's and Alavi's acceptance of positions on the NCCI. Standing Conference then decided to leave the 'organisation of organisations'.

In effect, the withdrawal of Standing Conference was much more than a militant black working-class organisation leaving one which was moderate, middle class, white-run and gradualist. 103

The  Standing  Conference  had  made  its  mind  up  about  CARD  fairly quickly.  Indeed  Conference  members  made  no  forceful  attempts  to  push CARD  in  any  direction.  While  personal  tensions  existed,  their  meetings were  not  frequent  enough  to  parallel  the  personal  breakdown  which  had occurred in the CARD Executive Committee. Perhaps the most significant aspect of Conference's ambivalence (or confusion) was reflected in the fact

that it could have made a significant contribution to CARD's development. Attesting  to  this,  members  of  both  the  dissident  group  and  the  working majority agreed that if Standing Conference had wanted to, given that the constitution was  weighted  in favour of organisations, it could have 'effectively controlled CARD'.  Selma  James  regretted their lack of commitment.  She  said,  'They  would  not  come  in  and  say  'Conference wants  A,  B,  and  C'  and  insist  on  getting  it.  I  think  they  would  have won.' 104

So unsure was Conference of its direction that soon after it disaffiliated from CARD, it decided to affiliate to the NCCI, thus trivialising criticism of Pitt  and  Alavi.  This  'peculiar  shift'  in  image  seemed  at  variance  with  a 'militant'  black  organisation. Yet  the  Standing  Conference  of West  Indian Organisations  during  the  first  years  of  CARD's  existence  was  both  a 'militant' black organisation and a talking shop. More fundamental, and the essential reason for its withdrawal from CARD,  was  its quest for 'independence' as an essentially working-class and middle-class organisation.

The richness of African culture and colour consciousness was a part of this independence. Although for men like Maxwell and Crawford, negritude and  a  distrust  of  multi-racialism  were  contributory  factors  towards  the development  of  a  militant  posture,  they  were  not  militant  or  isolationist enough. Thus, apart from being a form of gaining recognition, this posture also reflected discontentment over their powerlessness.

## David Pitt and Standing Conference

Central  to  the  CARD-Standing  Conference  split  was  the  personality  and career  of  the  CARD  Chairman,  David  Pitt. As  a  West  Indian  of  unusual achievement  in  British  public  life  (and,  indeed,  what  he  represented  to Standing  Conference  leaders)  Pitt  must  be  regarded  as  a  key  figure.  To many,  he  was  one  of  the  most  prominent  spokesmen  for  West  Indians  in Britain. His view of himself was quite different, however. According to one commentator,  he  thought  of  himself  as  an  Englishman  and  regarded  his birthplace as irrelevant. His renunciation of the West Indies, and willingness to  embrace  English  norms,  alienated  Conference  spokesmen.  They  were angry  and  resentful  that  a  member  of  their  own  more  representative organisation was not regarded as presenting a truer picture of West Indians in Britain.

If the Conference leaders were little known in Britain, Pitt, in contrast was well established. His middle-class origins in the West Indies had served him in good stead. In Britain, he became a man of many parts - a medical doctor,  a  Greater  London  Councillor  and  a  Labour  Party  candidate  for Parliament. More recently, he has become a member of the House of Lords. A well-educated, professional man, he moved easily in British society. Why was  Pitt  so  acceptable?  One  observer  commented:  'He  had  conventional status  in  British  terms  that  many  members  of  the  Conference  leadership structure did not have.' 105 What apparently differentiated him most clearly from Conference leaders was the fact that he did not identify with the rankand-file West Indian.

Pitt  was  involved  in  a  number  of  British  organisations,  and  what  was particularly galling to politically conscious West Indians was the fact that he took  no  special  interest  in  working  with  Standing  Conference.  More  than that, he was at times 'positively contemptuous of its efforts'. He was more concerned with mobilising white opinion in support of anti-discrimination work and to this  end  he  made  contact  with  many  people  in  British  party politics. He  was  no  novice. Indeed, he knew  conventional political techniques from his experience in West Indian politics. Born in Grenada, he became  active  in  politics  in  Trinidad,  helping  to  found  the  West  Indian National Party there. Both he and Conference members were in favour of a united West Indies.

As a politician, he urged West Indians in Britain to join political parties -  especially  the  Labour  Party,  even  though  the  Labour  Party  persisted  in extending the discriminatory immigration policy of the Conservatives. This action convinced Conference leaders of the futility of attempts to influence the party structure by working within it. Thus, when Pitt joined the NCCI and  made  'no  protest'  against  the  White  Paper,  this  was  interpreted  by Conference as acceptance of the government's immigration policy by Pitt.

Whatever personal rivalry there had been (although some advanced this as a cause for the CARD-Conference split) it was clear that Crawford had never attempted to challenge Pitt for the CARD leadership. However, both Crawford and Maxwell would have welcomed recognition as the spokesman for West Indians in Britain.

CARD and the National Federation of Pakistani Associations

CARD's  efforts  to  co-ordinate  effectively  the  work  of  the  Indians  and Pakistani  groups  in  Britain  were  no  more  successful  than  the  attempts  to attract the West Indians. The Indian Workers' Association, Great Britain was never  formally  affiliated  to  CARD,  while  the  National  Federation  of Pakistani  Associations  in  Great  Britain  was  barely  functioning  in  1967. Moreover, it had little contact with CARD.

The NFPA, representing local Pakistani societies and welfare associations,  decided  to  affiliate  to  CARD  in  March  1965,  a  few  months before  the  National  Founding  Convention.  Tussaduq  Ahmed,  a  London restauranteur and leader of London's Pakistani community, played a central role in the formation of the Federation in 1963 and also in the move to join CARD. Ahmed's aim was to bring the Pakistani community out from its isolation and orient it to participate in British life. Equal respect and equal status were important and desired goals.

Breaking out into the wider society is always a tentative and difficult process for immigrants. Not surprisingly therefore the Federation's leaders were  reluctant  to  join  the  embryonic  CARD  organisation.  They  felt  that Pakistani  immigrants  should  co-operate  with  sympathetic  members  of  the host society in order to establish channels of communication. They felt that CARD might become an 'all coloured' organisation, thus realising their fear of immigrant isolation.

Significantly in November  1965,  the  Federation  had  joined with Standing Conference and the Indian Workers' Association, Great Britain, to oppose the government's White Paper. A boycott was promised. 106  In early October, a letter signed by Nurul Islam was sent on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Federation asking for the resignations of Pitt and Alavi; Alavi, they said did not in 'any capacity' represent the Pakistani community.

The militancy of the Federation's leadership had led to a deterioration in its  relations  with  CARD.  By  early  1967,  there  was  little  communication between the organisations. In fact, the Pakistani community in Britain as a whole had no real links with CARD. By June 1967, there was no Pakistani representative on the CARD Executive and the places reserved for Pakistani organisations on CARD's  National Council were unfilled. Tussaduq Ahmed, the original Pakistani supporter of CARD remained on the National Council as a co-opted member.

This  lack  of  involvement  of  the  NFPA  with  CARD  reflected  internal disorganisation. The NFPA was founded in April 1963 by the leaders of the various Pakistani associations in Britain. Twenty-three organisations formally  launched  the  Federation  on  14 April  1963.  They  represented  21 localities and an estimated 15,000 members. 107 The Federation also adopted several aims and objects among which were to try to inculcate the spirit of organised and disciplined life among the overseas Pakistani community in general, and their organisations in particular; to provide a national platform for  the  Pakistani  Associations  in  Great  Britain,  and  in  this  regard  the Federation was to be the national spokesman of all the affiliated associations; and to be responsible for directing and executing all measures aimed at prompting on a national level, the social, cultural, economic and religious interests of the overseas Pakistani community. 108

The  constituent  organisations  came  together  in  the  Federation  to  deal with  the  specific  problem  of  getting  the  best  value  for  foreign  currency (pounds  for  example)  that  immigrants  were  remitting  to  Pakistan.  They were  also  concerned  with  the  security  of  life,  property  and  jobs.  More specifically, the Federation's leaders who felt that it was more profitable for Pakistanis in Britain to convert their earnings on the black market than to send  them  through  government  channels,  wanted  the  Pakistani  High Commission to press their government to either alter the exchange rate or provide  bonuses  for  people  sending  money  home.  After  resolving  this problem, the Federation (a 'proper organisation' which had only provided a base for an 'assiduous lobby' of the High Commission) suffered a series of factional  disputes  as  various  Association  leaders  jostled  for  positions  of influence.

In essence,  the  associations  which  constituted  the  Federation  had developed over a period of 15 years. Their activities were centred around issues that related to Pakistanis as a nationality group and not as 'coloured' immigrants in a foreign country. These groups were broadly concerned with social, cultural, religious and welfare issues relating to Pakistan.

In general terms, the Pakistani community, in a given area in 1967, was considered to be divided in three parts: students of middle class origin who planned  to  return  to  academic,  business,  political  or  professional  life  in Pakistan; middle-class multi-occupational entrepreneurs who ran the internal economies  of  the  communities;  and  workers  (many  of  them

unmarried)  who  were  in  Britain  temporarily  and  who  lived  in  dwellings with other Pakistanis. 109

At factory level, there was leadership within the working class, but this was  subsumed  by  organisation  at  a  more  communal  level  by  those  with higher economic  status; for example, the owners  of grocery shops, restaurants, travel agencies and other property. Thus workers seeking social contact out of loneliness and isolation joined the local association. Moreover, through their  village  or  regional  links  in  Pakistan  and  through the voluntary help they offered, the leaders gained the workers' support.

Often there were keen contests for positions within the associations, as rival leaders fought not so much to fulfil a desire to help the working people in the community, but essentially to satisfy a personal need for power and prestige.  Thus,  they  mobilised  people  not  on  the  issues  but  because  of 'obligations  and  territorial  alliances'.  It  was  clear  then  that  while  few workers  took  an  active  part  in  the  associations,  fewer  still  aspired  to leadership positions. A prerequisite for leadership was 'free time and a good education'.  Students  and  businessmen  were  the  front-runners  constituting the main groups engaged in the power contest.

Given this power structure, reflecting the divide between the rank and file workers and the Federation's leadership, it was clear that CARD would not  use  the  Federation  to  co-ordinate  the  efforts  of  the  local  associations against  discrimination.  Furthermore  CARD  as  a  multi-racial  organisation could  not  effectively  bring  together  the  various  associations  for  either concerted action or common statements. Indeed, if anti-discrimination work was to be done locally, the fact remained that a 'difficult reorientation' was necessary  among  the  associations  and  among  Pakistani  workers  whose isolation was bounded by attitudes of religion, language and culture.

## The Indian Workers' Association, Great Britain and CARD

The  politics  and  factional  divisions  which  characterised  the  IWA  during 1965-7 were complex and problematic. 110  Since the first IWA was founded in the 1930s to support the Indian Independence movement and to establish solidarity with British workers, the waves of Indian immigrants which came in the 1950s altered the nature, function and aims of the groups. In 1965, they  claimed  to  be  more  concerned  with  anti-discrimination  activities ranging  from  lobbying  to  demonstrations.  Even  as  far  back  as  1958,  the IWA was explicitly in opposition to discrimination on colour, creed or sex.

They were willing to co-operate with other organisations for the same ends: equal human rights and social and economic opportunities. This was in  contrast  to  the  vague  more  generalised  aim  of  Standing  Conference which called for understanding between the races and for integration.

The two foremost leaders of the IWA-GB in 1967, were Rattan Singh, President,  and  Jagmohan  Joshi,  General  Secretary,  who  were  regarded  by those  involved  in  British  race  relations  as  pro-Peking  communists.  IWA leaders in Birmingham were divided into three categories: those who held prestige within their village-kin group; entrepreneurs who ran the internal economy  of  the  community  and  the  university  educated  members  with experience and/or understanding of Indian politics. Moreover, 'Most members of the third group hold left-wing political views and some of them were members of left-wing parties in India.' 111

However,  in  1963,  as  the  Commonwealth  Immigrants Act  was  being debated, Joshi helped to found the Co-ordinating Committee Against Racial Discrimination  (CCARD),  a  federation  of  immigrant  organisations  and sympathetic British groups in Birmingham which was to oppose discrimination from a broader base.

At about the same time, complex strains were developing between the IWA-GB  and  the  Southall  Indian  community.  For  example,  different political approaches and ideologies; rivalry between Singh (President of the London IWA branch) and H. S. Ruprah, a leader of the IWA, Southall; a factional  struggle  for  control  of  the  Sikh  temple  in  Shepherds  Bush, resulting  in  Southall  breaking  away  from  the  IW A-GB  and  establishing itself as an independent Indian Workers' Association.

The IWA-GB had no formal contact with CARD during its formative stage  in  the  spring  of  1965  and  refused  to  affiliate.  Southall  IWA,  on  the other hand, agreed to support CARD. The reluctance of the national IWA to work with CARD was more clearly based on sharp differences in ideology than  in  the  case  of  CARD  and  Standing  Conference  or  the  Federation  of Pakistani Association. Approaches by Ranjana Ash, whose political sympathies were close to Joshi's, to persuade the IWA-GB to join CARD did not materialise. Fundamental political differences persisted. CARD was characterised  by  IWA-GB  leaders  as  a  front  organisation  for  the  Labour Party, a platform for careerists and as being dominated by the middle class.

Here again, a comparison could be made with Standing Conference. The dislike of CARD as an organisation associated with the Labour Party was different for the IWA-GB than it was for Standing Conference. For whereas Conference disliked the Labour Party because it had gone back on its word and had perpetuated discriminatory policies, the IWA-GB's critique, while including the Conference viewpoint, was also based on a broad conception of the proper nature of a 'Labour' Party.

The leaders of the IWA-GB, generally committed to the development of a  strong,  exclusively  working  class  movement  united  on  colour,  were  not opposed to the concept of a multi-racial organisation. Indeed, they were far less concerned about the influence of Whites than the West Indians. In fact, they were obviously sensitive to the 'strategic' value of British citizens in their  attempts  to  counteract  discrimination,  as  the  formation  of  CARD demonstrated.  They  felt  that  the  CARD  leadership  did  not  have  enough contact  with  black  workers  and  therefore  could  not  possibly  provide  the leadership against discrimination which they envisaged.

Apart from its relations with the Southall IWA, CARD's contacts with local Indian associations were rare and weak. There were branches of the IWA in Birmingham, Bradford, Coventry, Derby, Erith, Glasgow, Gravesend,  Huddersfield,  Leamington  Spa,  Leeds,  Leicester,  Nottingham, Southampton  and  Wolverhampton.  However,  only  the  IWAs  in  Bradford, Glasgow, Leamington Spa and Leeds were in touch with the local CARD groups  at  various  times. 112 In fact, the  Southall  IWA  was  'the  only immigrant group of a single nationality which had close relations with the national CARD structure.'

## Reaching for the grass roots

The WISC., IWAs and the NFPA were far removed from the representations of the CARD leadership. By June 1967, the 'organisation of organisations' idea had become untenable. In effect, CARD had failed to co-ordinate the efforts  of  other  groups  active  in  anti-discrimination  work,  to  act  as  a 'clearing house' for information and to help other interested organisations to campaign against discrimination.

Of  the  local  groups  affiliated  to  Standing  Conference,  only  one  (the multi-racial, all-party British Caribbean Association) was formally involved with CARD. And of the local groups affiliated to the Federation of Pakistan Associations  none  were  affiliated  to  CARD.  Finally,  none  of  the  local

branches of the IWA-GB had formal contact with CARD. Moreover, of the sympathetic  British  organisations,  only  the  National  Council  of  Civil Liberties  was  affiliated  to  CARD.  And  of  the  multi-racial  organisations there were two sub-categories, namely the voluntary liaison committees and the  local  anti-discrimination  groups.  Of  these  committees,  which  by  June 1967  had  increased  to  over  30,  only  the  Oxford  Committee  for  Racial Integration was an affiliate of CARD. Further, of the multi-racial local antidiscrimination groups two were affiliated - the Cardiff Inter-racial Council and the Leicester Campaign for Racial Equality.

Clearly, CARD had failed to involve the existing immigrant organisations. The reasons involved the usual problems that beset voluntary organisations  -  the  lack  of  time,  money  and  personnel.  While  there  was some truth in this, it might be more precise to state that the weaknesses of the CARD organisations were reinforcing in that an organisation cannot be built  because  there  is  no  money;  there  is  no  money  because  there  is  no organisation. Obviously, given greater support for CARD, a self-generating process was likely to bring about an efficient and strong organisation. The lack  of  organisation  was  therefore  both  a  cause  and  effect  of  CARD's failure to involve immigrants either individually or in groups.

The percentage of groups that could have been affiliated and in fact did so  was  extremely  small,  no  matter  how  one  calculates  'immigrant'  and 'sympathetic' organisations. The fact that no Pakistani organisations, only one  Indian  group,  just  two  West  Indian  organisations,  and  no  local  trade unions had affiliated indicates the low order of magnitude. Given that local association leaders, at least in the case of Standing Conference organisations  in  the  London  area,  and  possibly  the  Pakistani  associations, tended  not  to  be  actively  engaged  in  'political'  matters,  there  was  little enthusiasm about supporting a national umbrella organisation.

Thus there was no communication flow between these local groups and CARD whereby,  for  example,  CARD  could  ask  that  a  local  branch  of  a national  firm  be  tested  for  practising  discrimination,  or  the  immigrant organisation could ask national CARD to intercede on its behalf with the government in London.

By 1967, among those members of the CARD executive who were most interested in organising  locally,  there  was  a  general  wariness  of  the immigrant  associations  and  a  belief  that,  as  Ahmed  suggested  about Pakistanis,  it  was  necessary  to  go  directly  to  the  individual  immigrant  to

build  up  an  organisation. And  for  such  factors  as  the  immigrants'  status, their  patterns  of  behaviour  as  conditioned  by  life  in  their  homeland,  and their  reasons  for  coming  to  Britain,  they  could  not  generally  be  oriented towards  a  multiracial  group  (at  either  national  or  local  level)  engaged  in British politics. Obviously, CARD had to organise the communities if it was to gain the support.

Thus, many of the assumptions held by the founders of CARD in 1965 were proven wrong within two years. Individual immigrants did not come willingly into CARD assuming that they were reached. The organisation did not develop as planned since the fundamental problems of motivating and uniting newcomers of three different nationalities proved more complicated and  difficult  than  had  been  envisaged.  In  1967,  aware  of  immigrants' problems, CARD approached Jack Jones, General Secretary of the TGWU to ask if the union would put out a pamphlet in conjunction with CARD on discrimination in employment and affiliate formally with CARD. Significantly, the reply to both questions was negative. 113

The enigma of how to develop political consciousness among immigrants and how to secure their active participation in an organisation to oppose racial discrimination eluded and perplexed CARD officials at every step of the way during the two years of the organisation's existence.

The  factional  battles  within  CARD  raged  on,  steadily  weakening  it before the organisation finally lost all credibility. It was abundantly evident by  spring  1967  that  CARD  was  in  a  state  of  limbo,  detached  from  the political structure and from the immigrant communities. While the so-called 'Nandyites'  within  the  EC  hoped  for  the  passage  of  an  extended  antidiscrimination law during the summer of 1967, simultaneously a different group within the EC was laying plans for a different future. The immediate goal was not pressure for legislation, but rather a take-over of the CARD organisation.

Thus,  before  CARD  finally  collapsed,  a  new  mood  of  militancy  had stirred race relations in the summer.  On  26  July,  Roy  Jenkins  had announced the government's intention to extend the Race Relations Act of 1965  in  housing,  employment,  insurance  and  credit  facilities. Yet,  on  the same  day,  he  banned  American  Black  Power  leader  Stokely  Carmichael from Britain. While in London, however, Carmichael had made speeches at rallies in Notting  Hill  and  Brixton,  appeared  on  BBC  television  and

attended meetings of Islington CARD and the Standing Conference of West Indian Organisations.

In Britain, Carmichael preached the tenets of the Black Power movement initiated in the United States. Prominent coverage of rioting in several cities in the United States was given by the British press. In Britain, where only 2 per cent of  the  population  was  black,  'race  relations'  again surfaced as an explosive and fundamental issue.

Furthermore,  in  July  1967,  Michael  Abdul  Malik  (known  also  as Michael X or Michael de Freitas), the leader of the separatist Racial Action Adjustment Society, was arrested on charges of violating the public order provisions  of  the  Race  Relations  Act  1965.  Malik's  arrest  aroused  deep resentment among black immigrants who felt that Duncan Sandys should be indicted for stating the day after Malik's arrest that race riots in Britain were inevitable if black immigration was not stopped. Sandys suggested that the government pay the fares of all those immigrants who wished to return to their homelands. He also deplored the growing number of mixed marriages: 'The  breeding  of  half-caste  children',  he  said,  'would  merely  produce  a generation of misfits and create increased tension.' 114 No public censure of Sandys was made by the government.

Moreover, as Black Power activity increased, Nigerian playwright and poet, Obi Egbuna founded Britain's first Black Power group, the Universal Coloured People's Association. Thus violence, colour consciousness, Black Power  with  all  its  connotations  in  the  context  of  a  world-wide  black struggle, emerged from the fringes of Britain's racial minorities in the inner cities,  to  counteract  and  challenge  'the  concepts  of  integration,  multiracialism  and  anti-discriminatory  legalisms  upon  which  CARD  had  been built'.

Moreover, implicit criticism of CARD came from the Joint Council for the Welfare  of  Immigrants. The  limited  aims  of  the  organisation  were:  to help immigrants entering Britain by providing case-workers and establishing liaison with government officials at the ports and airports. In effect, those  refused  entry  could  approach  the  organisation  for  help. Although  the  scope  of  the  JCWI  was  'relatively  narrow',  it  received widespread support. By September 1967, more than 100 people representing  74  voluntary  organisations  met  at  the  Dominion  cinema ('bailiwick of the IWA Southall') and agreed to accept the constitution of the  JCWI.  Within  a  few  weeks,  115  immigrant  organisations,  from  the

'militant' IWA-GB to the 'mildest' West Indian cultural and social club, had become part of the JCWI. Thus, the formation of the JCWI invalidated the government excuse that there was no spokesman for the immigrant interest, at  least  on  immigration  procedures.  Given  these  developments  during  the months  leading  up  to  the  1967  Convention,  tensions  within  CARD  were mounting. The National Council had ceased to function and the Executive Committee  was  made  impotent  not  by  inertia,  but  by  division.  In  the developing  schism,  the  West  Indians  became  increasingly  isolated  and opposed what was referred to as the 'Anglo-Asian axis'.

Thus, three years after Martin Luther King had met immigrant leaders in  London  and  served  as  a  catalyst  for  a  new  organisation,  the  need  for strong, outspoken leadership, remained to be tackled realistically. Essentially,  immigrants  were  still  without  power.  CARD,  as  a  potentially united  front for all immigrants,  had  split  and  finally  collapsed.  The immigrant  community  was  left  to  devise  new  forms  of  organisation  and leadership. Some  had  already  begun;  others  would  make  transitional adjustments where their predecessors had failed.

## West Indian organisations in Moss Side and Easton

In June 1965, there were nine formal West Indian organisations in existence in  Moss  Side  (Manchester)  or  its  immediate  vicinity.  They  were:  The Colonial  Sports  Club,  The  Caribbean  Federal  Association,  The  Jamaican Circle,  The  Trinidad  and  Tobago  Society,  The  Jamaican Association,  The Leeward  Islands  Peoples' Association,  The  British  Coloured Association, The West Indian National Association, and The British Society for Coloured Welfare.

By  themselves,  these  associations  (as  their  leaders  were  well  aware) could  only  perform  limited  functions.  An  umbrella  organisation,  a  real necessity,  was  first  suggested  in  June  1965  in  a  letter  addressed  to  the various  West  Indian  associations'  leaders,  by  a  Tobago  economist  doing research at Manchester  University.  He  emphasised  that  the  proposed organisation was not intended to replace associations, but rather to serve as a point of contact between them.

When the leaders of the associations eventually met on 8 July, an ad hoc committee was set up. A list of recommendations was drawn up when the Committee met on 20 August. Indeed, it was suggested that the proposed organisation should take the form of a co-ordinating committee of bona fide organisations,  each  being  given  equal  representation  by  an  official  who would  act  on  its  behalf.  Moreover,  it  was  suggested  that  the  Committee should  co-opt  a  limited  number  of  persons  who  could  make  important contributions to the Committee's work. Furthermore, it was suggested that the Committee should have three purposes: (i) to co-ordinate the activities of  member  organisations  and  to  bring  about  closer  relationships  between them; (ii) to help the member organisations to strengthen themselves and to broaden the base of their activities; and (iii) to channel opinions between the  West  Indian  population  and  English  society  on  social  and  communal matters. When the ad hoc Committee met again on 26 September, it was unanimously agreed to set up the Co-ordinating Committee for Caribbean organisations. This body was later re-named the West Indian Co-ordinating Committee.

The  WICC  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  Committee)  represented  10 organisations - (the nine mentioned above, excluding the British Society for Coloured Welfare)  and  two  new  organisations,  the  West  Indian  Students' Association and the Bolton West Indian Sports Club. By 17 October when the  Committee  next  met,  the  number  of  organisations  it  represented  was reduced  to  six  and  then  to  five  (the  Colonial  Sports  Club;  The  Jamaican Association,  The  Caribbean  Federal  Association;  The  Leeward  Islands Peoples' Association and Cheetham Hill Social Club) at the meeting held on 7 November. Thereafter, the 'backbone' of the Committee was made up of representatives from five associations: the CSP, CFA, JA, LIA, the Trinidad and Tobago Association and three co-opted members. 115

## Aims and objectives

The  five constituent associations of the Committee  promoted  social activities  (dances  and  socials)  for  their  members.  All,  except  the  CSC., included educational and commercial activities and stressed the importance of co-operation with other West Indian organisations, primarily within the framework of the Committee.

A  comparison  of  the  activities  of  the  five  associations  showed  an important distinction between the Jamaican and non-Jamaican

organisations.  The  Trinidad  and  Tobago  Society  and  Leeward  Islands Peoples' Association, both engaged in activities other than social, attempted to  reach  West  Indians  in  other  associations  to  attend  a  debate  or  public lecture. The three Jamaican associations, on the other hand, did very little other than hold dances and routine meetings.

One reason suggested for the difference (between the T&amp;TS, the LIA and the Jamaican associations) was the quality of leadership in the T&amp;TS and  the  LIA,  which  was  young,  professional  and  had  not  been  long  in England, and the middle-aged, long-established and lower status in terms of jobs, of the Jamaican leaders. This distinction, it was argued, may indicate a division of the West Indian population in Moss Side along socio-economic lines. 116 The fact that no Jamaican students or professional individuals took an active interest partly explained the lack of harmony within the Jamaican Associations.

Nevertheless,  in  times  of  need,  these  associations  also  performed  a function for non-members. For instance, towards the end of 1967 and the early  part  of  1968,  as  the  police  intensified  their  campaign  against  West Indian  cellar  parties  or  shebeens  (characterised  by  loud  'bluebeat'  music and the sale of liquor) a number of cases of alleged police brutality had to be investigated. 117 The associations were helpful in directing the defendants to lawyers and solicitors. In a sense, this adversity (a rapid deterioriation of the  racial  situation)  brought  a  semblance  of  solidarity  to  an  essentially disorganised  community.  In  fact,  unlike  the  Pentacostalists,  most  of  the ordinary members of the associations experienced all their social relationships with their fellow members.

## The Co-ordinating Committee

Since  its  formation,  the  leaders  of  the  Co-ordinating  Committee  were dominated by younger West Indians (in their early thirties) from the T&amp;TS and  the  LIA.  They  were  in  direct  contrast  to  the  Jamaican  Association leaders. 118 Their authority was based more on personal charisma than was the case with the Jamaican leaders, and they were also more administratively capable.

Not  surprisingly,  friction  within  the  Committee  sometimes  exploded into bitter quarrels which developed between the 'lower class' and 'middle class'  Jamaican  representatives,  and  as  a  result  of  the  ethnic  and  class

differences that existed between the leadership and the majority of the West Indian population. 119

A major cause of conflict within the Committee was the socio-economic gap and the difference in ethnic origin which existed between the leadership and the West Indian population. Given growing concern that the executive of the Committee was not representing the real interests of the black man in Moss Side, the issue reached a head during the 'police brutality phase'.

The Committee's first two years of existence was a time of relative calm vis-à-vis the  racial  situation in Manchester, with multi-racial organisations establishing  themselves  and  incorporating  the  West  Indian  leaders  of  the different  organisations. 120 In  September  1967,  however,  race  and  colour became  major  issues  following  intensification  of  the  police  campaign against  illicit  drinking  and  all-night  cellar  parties.  Any  hope  of  racial harmony  vanished  with  a  spate  of  arrests.  The  police  were  accused  of brutality. The rapid deterioriation of the racial situation had repercussions within  the  Committee,  reflected  in  a  polarisation  of  attitudes.  Inevitably, there were calls for greater militancy.

Significantly,  the  situation  threw  up  a  new,  radical  working  class association, the West Indian United Association (WIUA) formed by young Jamaicans  in  Moss  Side  who  suffered  at  the  hands  of  the  police.  The Association's leaders were the 'informal leaders' of the 'bluebeat society' namely those who patronised the cellar parties, the cafes and the bettingshops. These leaders, aged under 40, who lived in Moss Side and worked in the  factories  (or  were  unemployed)  and  had  large  families  with  young children, were in direct contrast to the suburb-based leaders of the Jamaican Associations. 121 These  rank-and-file  leaders  knew  the  problems  of  West Indians  at  first  hand  and  were  able  to  command  the  support  of  large numbers of West Indians,  for  short  periods,  at  least.  Indeed,  having  been directly  affected  by  the  police,  they  carried  through  their  vigil  outside Manchester Town Hall and advocated protest and radical action against the police. The Committee members, on the other hand, who were not directly affected  by  the  actions  of  the  police,  favoured  'reasoned  consultations' between themselves as 'mouthpiece' for West Indians and the police.

CARD also  became  involved  during  the  police  campaign  against  the cellar  parties,  by  organising  a  protest  march  against  police  brutality.  The Dean of Manchester (Chairman of the Manchester Council for Community

Relations) and the Chairman of CARD managed to get the organisers to call off  the  march  because  the  Chief  Constable  promised  to  appoint  a  police liaison officer! This deal aroused the wrath of the few CARD radicals who felt  that  it  would  do  nothing  to  reduce  tension  or  cases  of  alleged  police brutality since the liaison officer was powerless to intervene once an arrest was made.

Interestingly, this group of radicals was predominantly of white students who were members of the Manchester International Socialist group. There was only  one West  Indian  involved.  He  was  an  informal  leader  who  had attended Committee meetings and was a member of the WIUA. Through his concern and efforts, the police brutality issue became a major issue in the Committee. Indeed, much of the criticism of the Committee's leaders came from him and his supporters.

A  split  within  the  West  Indian  community  was  evident.  The  CARD radicals  had  exerted  a  strong  influence  over  the  informal  leaders  of  the WIUA.  These  leaders  opposed  the  Committee,  who  gave  overwhelming support  to  the  Dean  and  the  Chairman  of  CARD.  For  a  time,  Committee meetings were exercises in confrontation between the informal leaders of the WIUA and the Committee's Executive.

Before the confrontation, the working-class Jamaicans, non-joiners and their  informal  leaders  were  inactive  in  inter-racial  activity  which  was dominated by the Committee and the Manchester Council for Community Relations.  However,  the'police  brutality  phase'  forced  the  Committee  to come to grips with the real problem reflected in the rank-and-file activity of an essentially Jamaican population which was clearly antagonistic towards their leadership; a leadership which was seen to be ethnically and socially separated from the grass roots. Indeed, the police issue showed a divergence of attitudes between  the  various  social groupings  represented  in  the Committee,  with  the  non-Jamaican  and  'middle-class'  Jamaican  leaders adopting  an  accommodative  approach,  while  the  informal  leaders  of  the WIUA and the Colonial Sports Club advocated a radical approach. In effect, there was, at the time, open conflict between young Jamaican activists and the accommodative leaders of the Committee. 122

The police raids on black working-class social activity in Moss Side had engendered a new mood of hostility towards the host society, as a whole. This hostility reflected an accumulation of disappointments, the result of the discrepancy between the West Indians' expectations and the extent to which

they  were  realised.  For  example,  the  expectations  of  being  accepted  as  a social equal and gaining well-paid employment to facilitate a return to the West  Indies  economically  secure  were  unrealised.  Thus,  the  migrant's perception  of  rejection  compounded  by  police  harassment,  resulted  in hostility and  bitterness  towards  Whites.  Simultaneously,  there  was  an increasing  commitment  to  settlement  in  Britain,  through  mortgage  debts and the  education  of  their  children.  Significantly,  there  was  no  change  in personal acceptance by members of the host society.

The new militant mood was conditioned by two 'external imperatives': the emergence of Black Power in the United States of America and Enoch Powell's  speeches  on  immigration.  The  Black  Power  influence  was  best seen during and after the 'police brutality phase'. Police brutality in Moss Side had attuned the West Indian working class to a new militancy which was encouraged by reports of the American racial situation.

Moreover, Powell's inflammatory speeches on black immigration aroused considerable anti-white feelings. The majority of West Indians felt that  Powell  more  or  less  reflected  the  views  of  the  majority  of  British society.  Furthermore,  and  significantly,  they  did  not  expect  the  racial situation to improve. More importantly, unsatisfactory inter-racial relationships were exacerbated by the nature of the employment market. As manual  workers,  West  Indians  were  particularly  vulnerable  in  times  of economic  recession; the prospects for their children were a deeply disturbing cause for concern.

## Black youth

Teenage  West  Indians  faced  problems  not  only  with  the  host  society  but also  with  their  parents  and  older  West  Indians.  There  was,  for  example, considerable inter-generational discontinuity between the immigrant teenagers and their parents.

The  adults  who  adopted  a  disciplinarian  approach  tended  to  relate  to youths simply in terms of superordination and subordination, displaying an unwillingness to get to know the young people. For the black youth who formed  an  essential part of the 'bluebeat society', many  in  lieu  of employment, resorted to 'hustling'. In fact, the militant WIUA leaders came from this 'bluebeat society'.

The West  Indian  teenager  was  'very  West  Indian'.  The  working-class Jamaican, for example, was drawn closely to Jamaican heritage, preferring

to  speak  patois  and  listen  to  bluebeat  music,  and  think  of  himself  as Jamaican.  Indeed,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  ethnic  isolation  of  social relationships  appeared  to  be  less  prevalent  among  West  Indian  teenagers than among adults there was a considerable reinforcing of West Indian, and particularly Jamaican, distinctiveness. Moreover, there was a marked racial 'encapsulation'  of  leisure-time  social  relationships  in  the  institutional  and informal spheres. While at school there was a considerable amount of interracial mixing, up to about 13 years old: after this contact was much less. In fact,  only  in  few  cases  were  these  relationships,  developed  at  school, continued after leaving.

Nevertheless  black  youths  showed  a  greater  willingness  than  their parents to make and develop contacts outside the West Indian community. 123   It  was,  however,  left  to  be  seen  whether  this  tendency towards inter-racial  mixing  among  teenagers  would  continue  as  teenagers assumed the roles of adults.

## Easton

In  Easton,  as  elsewhere  in  Britain,  a  variety  of  West  Indian  communal associations  sprang  up  in  the  face  of  the  host  society's  rejection.  But attempts to organise formal associations were characterised by ephemerality and  fragmentation  arising  from,  amongst  other  factors,  internal  conflicts, island parochialism, class status, and respectability.

The distinctions of class, status and colour, engendered by the colonial history  of  West  Indian  societies,  are  generally  reproduced,  albeit  in  a modified form, in British settlements. In Easton, however, both colour and physical attributes had diminished as important status features as the colour scheme of the West Indian societies gave way to a 'colour code' in Britain which sharply distinguished between Black and White.

Moreover, in religious membership, West Indians adhering to 'denominational beliefs' were accorded a higher status than members of the local black pentecostalist churches. The latter was seen as less respectable than the former.

Together,  these  distinctions  had  significant  consequences  for  potential and actual leadership of the West Indian population. In measuring status, for example, upwardly mobile West Indians had to decide in terms of their own island community  and  the  local  West  Indian  population  or  the  host community. For many, the safe option was retreat.

Needless to say, this withdrawal of higher status West Indians who were seen as potential local leaders falls in line with the avoidance of the middle class  Jamaicans  from  working  class  oriented  associations  in  Moss  Side. Thus, West Indian political mobilisation in Easton in mid-1970s, and earlier in  Moss  Side,  was  lacking  in  leadership  with  a  broader  perspective.  This lack  of  consistency  in  organisation  was  accentuated  by  the  stronger  local Indian and Pakistani associations. In time, white racism would have a more consolidating effect on black organisations generally. 124

## Black churches

By 1970, almost a generation after the first major group of postwar West Indian and African settlers came to Britain, they found that their last refuge of  hope  (the  Christian  religion)  had  also  been  infected  with  racism.  This realisation  was  surprising,  even  shocking,  to  most  black  Christians,  given the missionary zeal with which British missionaries had carried the word of God to the black, uncivilised heathens in the colonies. At once, it was clear the  white  Christians  were not practising what they had for centuries been preaching.

Rejection  by  the  English  Christians,  during  this  formative  period  of black  working-class  life  in  Britain,  led  increasingly  to  West  Indians  and Africans setting up their own forms of worship, in spite of the fact that they had previously and regularly attended British  churches  in  their  respective colonial homelands. As white Christians stayed away from their places of worship, a 'quiet revolution' was taking place among black Christians.

This  'urban  evangelical  explosion',  contrary  to  the  trend  in  religious belief in Britain, resulting in the rapid growth of West Indian and African churches was, as Clifford Hill put it, 'a movement of the proletariat', which sprang from the grass roots. He added, 'It is led by no solid middle-class trend-setters.  It  has  no  ruling  intelligentsia.  It  has  not  been  produced  by (neither  has  it  produced)  any  outstanding  charismatic  leaders.' 125 Indeed, the  leader  and  founder  of  the  largest  of  the  sects  in  Britain,  the  New Testament Church of God, the Revd O. A. Lyseight exercised an effective but spectacular behind-the-scenes leadership over his nation-wide organisation. 126

An interesting feature of the development of these black working-class churches  was  its  spontaneity  among  people  seeking  through  religion, satisfaction of their spiritual and emotional needs. Confronted with earlier forms  of  oppression  (as  in  slavery  and  colonialism)  religion  performed  a similar  function.  Clearly,  the  problems  of  worship  could  only  be  tackled with  satisfaction,  given  the  rejection  of  white  churches',  by  rank-and-file black migrants.

These were the circumstances in which there was a rapid increase in the formation  of  all-black  congregations  in  migrant  areas.  The  earlier  local 'house-meetings' gave  way  to larger congregations in disused white churches. While many of these local congregations had affiliated to a few larger  sects  which  originated  in  the  West  Indies, Africa  or  in  the  United States of America, many remained autonomous. These black church groups began to appear in the early 1950s.

## West Indian sects

Many  of  the  West  Indian  sects  met  as  home  groups.  Interestingly,  even within  these  small  (enlarged  family  prayer  meetings)  there  were  constant leadership  battles,  which  brought  'fission  and  fusion'.  In  spite  of  the difficulties  of  gathering  reliable  figures,  the  rapid  growth  rate  can  be measured from earlier estimates. In 1962, there was an estimated total of 77 West Indian sect congregations of all types in Britain. This increased to well over one hundred twelve months later, reaching an estimated 390 in January 1966.  Since  the  mid-1960s  a  clearer  pattern  emerged  with  many  small independent  groups  forming  national  organisations.  Their  establishment reflected  a  degree  of  independence:  occupying  their  own  premises  and being run by full-time pastors and administrators.

The largest West Indian sects were The New Testament Church of God; The Church of God Prophecy; and The Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ. 127 The NTCG, formed in 1953 held its first group meeting in a rented YMCA hall in Wolverhampton. Four years later, eleven other groups had sprung up in  the  Midlands  and  London  area.  The  NTCG  bought  a  small  hall  in Hammersmith, London and with the rapid increase of its membership to 23 congregations, they were able to set up a national organisation with its base in  Birmingham.  Through  this  national  network  they  were  able  to  further increase their membership.

The NTCG received the support of the Church of God in Cleveland, in America, to which it was affiliated. Through 'great personal sacrifices' the organisation was able to purchase other buildings for worship. In fact, by 1966  the  organisation  had  grown  to  61  congregations  (total  membership 10,500)  administered  by  15  full-time  ministers.  In  addition,  20  students were in training for the ministry at a theological college and the 8 provinces across the country were each administered by a full-time overseer.

Given  these  rapid  strides  in  organisation,  the  total  sect  membership increased from 10,500 in 1966 to 15,800 in 1968 to 20,600 in 1970. Among the West Indian congregations most, though often similar in their type of worship,  differed  in  emphasis  on  certain  points  of  doctrine.  There  was, however, a large body of common characteristics in terms of preaching and life-styles. 128

Life styles Like the African Church of the Cherubim and Seraphim, the West Indian  sects,  'strongly  authoritarian'  and  'hierarchical',  demanded  high standards  of  personal  morality  with  strict  taboos  on  tobacco,  alcohol, obscene  language  and  extramarital  sex  relationships.  Women  could  not wear  cosmetics  or  too  much  jewelry,  and  hairstyles  and  dress  had  to  be conservative. Moreover, members were expected to give a tithing of 10 per cent. 129

In terms of social class, the membership of the West Indian sects varied. The evidence shows that in the NTCG, the majority of members were not from  the  'lowest  classes'  but  from  the  migrant  'new  middle  class'. 130 Indeed, many sect members had become home-owners and landlords, who owned cars and enjoyed a 'good standard of economic prosperity.' 131  But by 1970 the NTCG population was 20,600, a small proportion of the vast majority of working class West Indians in Britain, who were far-removed from  a  'good  standard  of  living  and  economic  prosperity'.  How  truly representative then have the West Indian and African sects been of the black working class in Britain?

## African sects

Given  a  smaller  African  population,  although  there  were  fewer  African congregations, nevertheless they were 'equally fast-growing'. The Africans concerned,  who  came  mainly  from  Nigeria,  had  settled  mainly  in  South, North and East London. Through affiliation many of the small independent

local  congregations  formed  the  Church  of  the  Lord  in  South  London  -  a Nigerian  Yoruba  sect.  The  Church  of  the  Cherubim  and  Seraphim,  the largest of the affiliated African groups (also a Yoruba sect) had established congregations  in  the  West  Midlands  and  London.  The  CCS's  largest congregation was in Newham, East London where it met in a former cooperative hall. The membership was predominantly male students.

Although the CCS was not Pentecostal in its form of worship it bore many similarities  to  the West  Indian  sects.  Music  was  important.  Singing (very expressive) was 'loud and rhythmical'. Moreover, at certain stages in the worship individuals lapsed (as did Pentecostalists) into 'speaking with tongues'. 132 Their worship services were of long duration, lasting some four or five hours on Sundays.

In  terms  of  lifestyles,  unlike  the  West  Indian  NTCG  whose  members followed the European Protestant culture in a fusion of religious and moral precepts,  such  an  ideology  was  alien  to  the  African.  This  has  been  the difficulty of Christian missionaries who saw their evangelical task as one of replacing African culture with a European-oriented culture. As one observer put it, 'Their practice of the Christian faith enables members to overcome the  evil  forces  that  surround  them.  It  does  not  require  them  to  practise  a particular form of morality or to change social customs that are indigenous to an African way of life.' 133

In  answering  the  question,  why  the  sects  have  grown,  Hill  saw  the rejection  of  English  churches  as  a  major  factor.  Given  that  there  was  no single  solution  for  this  rejection  by  the  English  churches,  in  seeking  an answer one had to transcend the bonds of religion and enter the field of race relations  in  Britain.  He  cited  five  reasons  for  this  rejection,  including 'culture shock', racial discrimination and its attendant disillusionment with the English; the conformity to English culture in that the English working classes  are  largely  absent  from  churches;  the  basic  failure  of  Christian mission;  and  the  failure  to  satisfy  the  religious  needs  of  black  people  in Britain, 134 due to differences in their pattern of worship in comparison with the churches of the New Commonwealth.

While these differences in worship and doctrine may account for some of  the  all-black  congregations,  it  was  argued  that  the  importance  of  these differences as formative factors should not be exaggerated, firstly because many  West  Indian  Pentecostal  assemblies  would  never  have  come  into

existence if their founders had been welcomed into local English Pentecostal communities; and secondly, no amount of stress upon doctrinal or other differences can account for the phenomenal growth rate of the allblack congregations. 135

Moreover, the fact remains that if the membership of the West Indian Pentecostal  Assemblies  were  entirely  composed  of  those  who  had  been Pentecostalists in their home countries, or if the African churches in Britain were only attended by former members of those same sects in Africa one could  give  credence  to  such  an  argument,  but  this  was  not  so.  Indeed,  a growing  number  of  disaffected  members  of  all  major  branches  of  the Christian church who felt alienated from the English churches or rejected by  white  Christians  found  ready  acceptance  in  the  congregations  of  the black churches. 136

## Social deprivation

Another factor related to the rapid growth of all-black churches in Britain, particularly between 1960 and 1970 was the role of social deprivation. In fact, it has been argued that there is a relationship between the growth of the West Indian NTCG,  the  African CCS  sects and the experience of deprivation due to social rejection. 137 Indeed, the ethnic and status deprivation  of  New  Commonwealth  migrants  had  the  effect  of  social solidarity among members of the 'pariah' group.

Social  deprivation  seems  to  be  crucial.  In  the  1964  General  Election race  first  became  a  political  issue  in  a  British  election; 138 thereafter  'race relationships' received increasing attention from the mass media and from the  MP  Enoch  Powell  and  other  race-conscious  politicians.  In  time,  they managed to make 'hard line' attitudes and racism 'respectable'. Naturally, black  people  were  conscious  of  the  fact  that  more  black  men  were prosecuted than white men under the Race Relations Act 1965 which was designed  to  protect  Blacks  from  racial  discrimination.  What  Powell  and Duncan Sandys were saying conveniently escaped the prosecutors' notice. According  to  one  observer,  the  beginning  of  the  hardening  of  racial attitudes in 1964  marked  the  point  after  which  the  immigrant  black churches received their high growth rate. 139 It is clear then that the degree of felt deprivation increased the sects' membership.

The creative role of West Indian and African sects, it was hoped, would 'one  day  break  through  into  the  local  white  population'.  The  black  sects could radically affect the course of church history as well as race relations. Hill, who had testified how much he had gained from worshipping in West Indian  congregations  and  under  West  Indian  leadership,  expressed  this optimism and urgency:

If  the  English churches are to benefit from the vision and spiritual gifts  of  the  Africans  and  West  Indians,  then  the  first  step  is  the recognition of their ministry and the admission of their representatives, on a fully equal-status basis, into ecumenical church councils. There are indications that this is beginning to happen, but much more needs to be done, and much more quickly. 140

Given  that  black  churches  have  played  a  central  role  in  demanding equal rights for black people in the nineteenth century and in the development of Pan Africanism, by the end of the 1960s in Britain they had responded positively to racism in 'the house of God' by forming autonomous organisations.

## Black organisations: the 1970s and 1980s

## The workplace

To combat the problems of black workers, strike committees were formed and  conferences  were  called  to  highlight  the  problem  of  racism  at  the workplace. Arising from this struggle, the Black Trade Unionists Solidarity Movement was formed. In fact, by 1980 there were some 59 projects and groups involved in the industrial aspects of race relations. 141 More specifically, in the Midlands and Wales area there were 29 ethnic minority organisations concerned with employment  in 1982. 142 These groups indicate  to  a  large  extent  that  traditional  trade  unionism  could  not  deal effectively  with  the  special  problems  of  black  workers.  Self-help  and autonomous  organisation  was  the  only  response  to  racial  discrimination among employers and trade unions.

The black community

The 1970s and early 1980s have been crucial for the black community in terms of organisation. The cumulative effects of racial disadvantage in all aspects of the black community's life such as police harassment, particularly against black youth; provocation from extremist fascist organisations,  and  the  overall  racist  (both  individual  and  institutional) violence had served to reinforce black resistance. Throughout the 1970s the harassed black community offered strong resistance. Rebellion, after a long gestation period, eventually came in the early 1980s.

While member organisations within the Black Peoples' Alliance (BPA) were  allowed  local  autonomy  in  terms  of  the  particular  communities  and problems, moves  at national level and co-ordination of the various campaigns against racism were the task of the BPA. In 1969, the Alliance took to the streets leading a march of over 7000 people to Downing Street to  demand  the  repeal  of  the  Immigration  Acts.  Feelings  ran  high  as  the Black Panther Movement warned: 'Unless something is done to ensure the protection of our people … we will have no alternative but to rise to their defence. And once we are driven to that position, redress will be too late, Detroit and Newark will inevitably become part of the British scene and the Thames foam with blood sooner than Enoch Powell envisaged'. 143  Thus, the racial ball was thrown back into Powell's and his followers' court.

The 1971 Immigration Act was no less damaging in its effects on the black community. This was one more stage in the deepening of state racism. Another strand of continuing associational concern was the serious question of  the  education  of West  Indian  children. The  North  London West  Indian Association  which  was  set  up  by  West  Indian  parents  and  teachers  in Haringey,  North  London,  in  the  1960s,  under  the  leadership  of  Jeff Crawford,  had  aroused  interest  among  black  parents  in  many  other  areas and became  an integral part of the programmes  of black political organisations. Clearly the question of ESN schools could not be left to the British authorities. The Caribbean Education Association held a conference on the ESN schools, and soon after, Bernard Coard clarified the problem in his work How the West Indian Child is made Educationally Subnormal .

In the wake of this exposé, a number of black militants and organisations  took  the  initiative  by  setting  up  supplementary  schools.  In London,  the  activity  was  particularly  intense.  Among  the  schools  set  up were the Kwame Nkrumah school (Hackney Black Teachers), the Malcolm X Montessori Programme (Ahoy Ghose), the George Padmore School (John

La Rose, leader of the Black Parents Movement), the South East London Summer  School  (BUFP:  Black  Unity  and  Freedom  Party),  Headstart (BLF:Black  Liberation  Front)  and  the  Marcus  Garvey  school  (BLF  and others). 144

Moreover,  there  was  an  impressive  development  of  projects  to  teach skills  to  black  youth.  For  example,  the  Mkutano  Project,  started  by  the BUFP in 1972, taught typing, photography and Swahili; the Melting Pot set up  by  Ashton  Gibson  (formerly  of  RAAS)  organised  a  workshop  for clothes-making; and the Keskidee was organised by Oscar  Abrams (formerly  of  CARD)  who  taught  art  and  sculpture  and  encouraged  black poets and playwrights.

For older students, Roy Sawh supervised the Free University for Black Studies; for the unemployed and homeless black youth, there were hostels, such as Brother Herman's Harambee and Vince Hines' (formerly active in RANS)  Dashiki  and  youth  centres  and  clubs.  Furthermore  there  were bookshop-cum-advice  centres, namely  the black peoples' information centre; BLF's Grassroots Storefront and BWM's (Black Workers' Movement  was  the  Black  Panther's  new  name  in  the  1970s)  Unity Bookshop. Among the publications, weekly and monthly newspapers, were Black Voice (BUFP), Grassroots (BLF), Freedom News (Black  Panthers), Front-line (Brixton and Croydon Collective), Uhuru (Black Peoples Freedom  Movement), BPFM Weekly ,  the BWAC Weekly (Black  Workers' Action Committee) and the less frequent but more theoretical journal Black Liberator , among a number of other more ephemeral publications.

The  question of black women  was  taken  up  by  some  of  these publications  and  the  BUFP  (following  on  the  UCPA's  Black  Women's Liberation Movement) had a black women's action committee. Interestingly,  after  RAAS's Black House was raided by police and closed down, many of its members helped to organise various self-help projects as mentioned above.

By 1971 the repressiveness of the system had also led to the break-up of the UCPA. The hard core of the membership went on to form the BUFP. In the  previous  two  years,  the  UCPA,  RAAS,  the  Black  Panthers  and  other black  organisations  had  been  increasingly  concerned  with  police  brutality and fascist violence. But as Sivanandan argued:

The success of Black Power had brought down on its head the wrath of the system. Its leaders were persecuted, its meetings disrupted, its places  of  work  destroyed.  But  it  had  gone  on  gaining  momentum and  strength:  it  was  not  a  party,  but  a  movement,  gathering  to  its concerns  all  the  strands  of  capitalist  oppression,  gathering  to  its programme all the problems of oppressed peoples. There was hardly a black in the country that did not identify with it and, through it, to all  the  non-whites of the world, in one way or another. And as for the British-born youth, who had been schooled in white racism, the movement was the cradle of their consciousness. Vietnam, GuineaBissau,  Zimbabwe,  Azania  were  all  their  battle  lines,  China  and Cuba  were  exemplars.  The  establishment  was  scared.  The  media voiced its fears. There were rumours that Black Power was about to take over Manchester City Council. 145

Blacks had to fight simultaneously both as a people and as a class (for instance  as  Blacks  and  as  workers,  their  struggle  against  racism  was  a struggle  for  the  class).  They  were  engaged  in  a  number  of  strikes  in  the early 1970s in the textile and allied industries of the East Midlands and in factories in London.

In  the  1972  strike  at  Crepe  Sizes  in  Nottingham  involving  Pakistani workers,  with  no  support  from  the  TGWU,  they  formed  a  Solidarity Committee  composed  of  wives  and  the  families  of  the  strikers,  of  other Asian workers, community organisations and the Nottingham-based BPFM, which put pressure on the union to act.

Time  and  again,  black  workers  confronted  trade  union  racism.  The NCTUAR  called  on  trade  unions  and  trade  unionists  to  back  workers' official strike action against racial discrimination. Moreover, they leafletted the  TUC  Annual  Conference  in  Blackpool.  A  clear  pattern  had  again emerged:  all  the  black  political  organisations  (the  London-based  BUFP, BCC., BWCC and the BWM, and the East Midlands-based BWAC and the BPFM) gave support to the strikers. Further, the BWAC informed the NonAligned  Conference  in Algiers  of  the  international  operations  of  ITT,  the multinational company involved.

By  the  time  of  the  Imperial  Typewriters  strike  in  1974,  there  was virtually a standing conference of black strike committees in the Midlands, a  network  of  community  associations  and  groups,  and  a  number  of  black

political  organisations,  all  in  support  of  the  strikers.  In  fact,  financial support  came  from  a  number  of  sources  such  as  the  Southall  IWA,  the Birmingham  Sikh  temple,  a  Women's  Conference  in  Edinburgh,  the Birmingham  Anti-Racist  Committee  and  the  European  Workers'  Action Committee.

The Community Relations Commissions (CRC) which emerged as the successor to the NCCI under the Race Relations Act of 1968 was merged (through  the  1976  Race  Relations Act)  with  the  Race  Relations  Board  to form the new Commission for Racial Equality. The CRE, armed with a few more  powers  to  deal  with  discrimination,  was  to  develop  'a  class  of collaborators who would manage racism and its social and political fall-out. At the same time, it would hand out massive sums of money from its Urban Aid  programme  to  key  black  self-help  groups  and  so  stamp  out  the breeding-grounds of resistance'. 146

The murder on 4 June 1976 of an Asian youth in Southall stunned the community. The old-style traditional forms of organisation proved inadequate  in  the  circumstances;  new  radical  forces  in  the  community emerged in the form of the Southall Youth Movement. This initiative led to the formation of a number of other Asian Youth movements; organisations which were largely concerned with defence in the face of fascist attacks. As racist attacks and murders increased, Asian youth organisations and defence committees were formed in London (Brick Lane, Hackney and Newham), Manchester, Leicester and Bradford. And in the same community spirit of the  strike  committees,  formed  earlier,  these  youth  groups,  supported  each other  and  joined  and  worked  together  with  West  Indian  youth  groups, occasionally on an organisational basis (SYM and Peoples Unite, Bradford Blacks and Bradford Asian Youth Movement) and, at times, as individuals participating  in  political  groups,  such  as  the  Hackney  Black  Peoples' Defence Organisation and Bradford's United Black Youth League. 147

Political  groups  were  also  formed  involving  radical  Afro-Caribbeans, Asians and Africans disenchanted by the white left because they neglected the black experience. And characteristically, as all black political organisations  have  historically  done  (beginning  with  the  Pan Africanists), they focused not only on the black condition in Britain, but also on Blacks internationally.  In  belief  and  approach  they  were  anti-racist  and  antiimperialist; both were acted out as a lived experience in their communities.

Their concern to politicise black people was reflected in their publications: Samaj in 'a Babylon (in Urdu and English), Black Struggle and Mukti .

Following these organisational developments, the Black Socialist Alliance moved  on  to 'campaigning  material'. Blacks  Against State Harassment  concentrated  on  state  racism.  Many  other  papers,  journals, news  sheets  and  newsletters  were  published,  but  shortlived.  Indeed,  they represented  various  stages  of  black  struggle.  Nevertheless,  the  movement was always in one direction: against the police, the government and racism.

Flexibility  within  the  black  movement  was  vital.  There  had  been  a qualitative change in the relationship between the organisers and organisations. In 1969, the educated middle-class leadership in Moss Side, for example, and later in Easton, either evaded leadership positions or did so  as  authoritarian  figures.  By  the  mid-1970s,  however,  after  consecutive struggles,  at  various  levels,  some  organisers  who  had  hitherto  led  as charismatic accommodationist, liberal individuals, could no longer do so.

State  racism  and  racial  discrimination  increasingly  engendered  black community  demands  for  representation  that  reflected  these  basic  issues. Indeed the stage was reached when 'the educated gave of their skills to the community and the community grounded them in the realities of political struggle'. 148

## The black women's movement in the 1970s

The strikes involving black workers in the 1970s saw a new phenomenon on  the  British  industrial  relations  scene:  Asian  women  'womanning'  the picket  lines,  with  an  unusual  commitment.  In  their  various  industrial struggles,  they  were  consistently  supported  by  women's  groups. As  their experience deepened and their particular problems loomed large, a 'black women' movement emerged. 149

Black feminist groups Between 1977 and 1980, the provocative daubings, meetings  and  marches  of  the  National  Front  in  areas  of  large  black communities  heightened  black  resistance  which  led  to  new  types  of struggles and new leaderships in the form of a black women's movement; a movement encompassing all the struggles and adding its own perspective to the black resistance in the late 1970s. For at least a decade previously a few Afro-Caribbean  women's  groups,  pursuing  legitimate  issues,  germane  to

black women, were isolated in their efforts since neither the black political groups nor the white women's liberation movement showed real concern.

Through  contact  at  the  point  of  common  industrial  struggles,  Asian women began to support their Afro-Caribbean sisters  at  Grunwick  and  at Heathrow  Airport.  By  1978,  awareness  of  their  social,  economic  and political  position,  in  the  black  community  and  in  white  society  generally, increased dramatically. A number of black women's groups came into being and  formed  a  national  body,  the  Organisation  of  Women  of  Asian  and African Descent. OWAAD  published  its  own  paper  FOWAAD.  And recognising  the  organisational  complexities,  to  be  effective  it  allowed  its constituent groups local autonomy. Moreover, it held national conferences and significantly worked in conjunction with other black national groups. This crucial development, long overdue, was able to highlight and orchestrate the different experiences of Asian and Afro-Caribbean women. In  developing  particular  strands  of  struggles,  they  supported  each  other's campaigns and, through this process, benefited and strengthened the black community as a whole.

Their struggles relating  to  households  and  children's  welfare  reflected the  very  essence  of  black  community  life.  Thus,  this  new  leadership confronted  simultaneously  the  issues  of  discrimination  against  class,  race and gender. Asian and Afro-Caribbean women combined forces to tackle a number of on-going problems specific to the black community. Moreover, Asian women joined the campaigns against 'Sin-bins' (special 'adjustment units'  which  replaced  ESN  schooling  for  West  Indian  children)  and  the Brixton Black Women's Group organised the first black women's centre in 1979. 150

Black women as a whole recognised their problem as a common racism, as  endemic  in  the  social,  educational  and  welfare  services  of  the  entire community.  Health  care  was  particularly  germane:  in  Brent  there  were campaigns against sickle-cell anaemia (among West Indians) and vitamin D deficiencies causing rickets (among Asians). The fertility and mental health of black women were also matters of serious concern to both communities.

Certain aspects of immigration had disturbing effects on Asian women which the male-oriented IWA had neglected, woefully. Asian women began to  put  this  right  as  AWAZ  and  Southall  Black  Sisters  (formed  after  the police violence on 23 April 1979) led the protest against the virginity testing and X-raying of immigrants. The IWA followed this lead. Following Asian

youth groups, these women joined the community campaigns over specific immigration cases.

By the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, black women were again actively involved in industrial struggles at Futters (March-May 1979)  and  at  Chix  (1979-80).  They  also  worked  in  local  self-defence groups  and  in  the  BSA  and  BASH  national  campaigns.  Significantly,  in June  1979,  their  work  jointly  with  IWA  and  BASH,  resulted  in  the  first black  national  demonstration  against  state  brutality.  During  this  march, Jagmohan  Joshi,  one  of  the  longest  serving,  militant  black  organisers  in Britain, died of a heart attack. This was a fitting epitaph for a man who had not  only  initiated  black  working  class  and  community  movements  in  the early years of struggle, but also 'clarified for us all the lines of race/class struggle'. 151

Historically then, the black working-class organisers and organisations spent much time resisting the British government's ideology of racism and repression. Consistently, their practices and policies have been anti-working class, anti-women, and anti-youth. In pursuit of the ideology of repression, the state relied heavily on the police and policing. Increasingly (particularly during the 1970s) police brutality and police harassment of black youth and the  black  community  came  to  a  head  as  an  'accumulation  of  blunders' resulted in the Bristol 'riot' in 1980 and the national summer 'riots' of 1981.

During  these  riots  the  police  resorted  to  'dispensing  justice  on  the streets, to arbitrary arrests and in some cases mass arrest'. By Tuesday 14 July,  according  to  the  press,  1000  people  had  been  arrested.  This  figure, according to the Home Office, had risen to 3000 by 20 August 1981. After the  'riots',  committees  were  set  up  to  defend  and  campaign  for  those arrested, and to expose the official version of events. In Brixton, the black community organisations were headed by the Brixton Defence Campaign.

The BDC called for a total boycott of the state's inquiry into the Brixton Uprising of 10-13 April 1981, set up under Lord Scarman's chairmanship, with the terms of reference: 'To inquire urgently into the serious disorders in Brixton  on  10-12  April  and  to  report, with  the power  to  make recommendations.'

The BDC argued that there was no escaping the fact that the Scarman inquiry  (particularly  Phase  I)  'very  seriously  prejudices  the  legal  position and therefore endangers the liberty of all defendants yet to be tried'. The

three main arguments against this Phase were firstly, that Scarman himself had positively to agree that Phase I will 'prejudice the rights of fair trial to those who have yet to come before the courts'; secondly, the question that must be asked was: what were the 'immediate causes' into which Scarman was  going  to  investigate  so  urgently  in  Phase  I.  (They  argued  that  the immediate causes of what happened in Brixton were already well understood); and thirdly, instead of looking at the real 'immediate cause' of the uprising, they feared that Scarman would 'give subtle legitimacy to the totally  racist  view  (so  dramatically  put  by  Margaret  Thatcher)  that  the Brixton  uprising  was  simply  a  confrontation  between,  on  the  one  hand, fundamentally blameless forces of law and order and, on the other, mainly black criminals!'

Thus, the BDC was satisfied that Lord Scarman was disposed to be used by  the  state  to  provide  it  with  a  basis  for  re-writing  the  Riot Act  and  to provide justification for dramatically increasing repressiveness in policing methods which were already massively racist, lawless and brutal as well as substantially uncontrolled. Why, the BDC asked, was there no response by the state to the repeated requests for a public inquiry into police brutality and malpractice during the previous five years.

On  Phase  II  of  the  Scarman  inquiry,  it  argued  that  for  the  black community there were no benefits to be derived for three reasons. Firstly, it was not aware that Scarman had any expertise in the field of social policy and was not satisfied that even were he to have both the necessary expertise and sympathy that these would be sufficient, given the other factors which apply. Secondly, that there were no good reasons to hold that ignorance on the  part  of  the  state  was  a  major  cause/force  determining  the  present direction of its policies in the field of housing, employment, education, etc. Thirdly,  that  the  BDC  was  satisfied  particularly  that  where  the  black communities'  grievances  over  the  racist,  brutal,  lawless  and  uncontrolled policing methods used against them were concerned, the state had no basis for even claiming to be ignorant. 'A mountain of evidence', the Campaign argued, had been 'submitted and ignored'. 152

The Liverpool 8 Defence Committee, the Liverpool Black Organisation and  the  Liverpool  Trades  Council,  called  for  the  dismissal  of  the  Chief Constable  of  Merseyside,  Kenneth  Oxford.  All  three  organisations  were firmly  convinced  that  he  was  the  prime  obstacle  in  the  way  of  any constructive dialogue between the police and the community. The

Committee's specific reasons were, given that the responsibility for the fair and proper policing of any community was the responsibility of the Chief Constable, Oxford's own racism, combined with his belief that tough and repressive  policing  methods  were  the  best  way  of  establishing  order,  had resulted  in  excessive  police  harassment,  especially  of  black  people  which stretched back many years; that Oxford was well-known for making racist remarks about the Liverpool 8 Community; that Oxford had shown himself to be incompetent; that the treatment of those arrested during and since the 'riots'  was  appalling;  that  three  weeks  after  the  'riots'  young  people  had been  stopped  and  searched  for  no  reason  at  all,  racially  abused  and frequently  questioned  about  their  movements  during  the  weekend  of  the riots; and that Oxford had, as a last ditch attempt to gain credibility within the  community,  invited  representatives  of  the  community  groups  to  meet with him.

The Liverpool 8 Defence Committee wondered why Oxford had waited to  engage  in  dialogue  with  a  community  which  had  been  harassed  by  his police  for  many  years,  and  towards  which  he  had  shown  himself  to  be racist.  Thus,  the  Liverpool  8  Defence  Committee,  the  Liverpool  Black Organisation  and  the  Charles  Wootton  Centre  declared  that  they  would boycott the meeting and called upon other community organisations to do the  same. Also caught in the struggle were the outspoken Hackney Legal Defence Committee and the United Black Youth League in Bradford.

Indeed in the aftermath of the 'riots', black organisers and organisations in  the  various  black  communities  nationally  had  rallied  round  to  support their victimised youths, as they alerted each other to their common need and common oppression. Before the 1980 and 1981 'riots', the black working class fought in isolation. Now through an historical progression of struggle (having  shifted  and  reformed,  through  new  types  of  struggles  and  new leaderships) they have attained a hard-won national black class consciousness. And in this process, they were joined, if only fleetingly, by white  youth,  militant  white  women  and  gays.  But  how  did  this  black consciousness develop?

## 11 Black Working Class Consciousness

## Black youth: the oppressed seen as a social problem

## Social policy and black youth

Gradually,  during  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s  it  was  realised  that  the education system had been failing the black second generation 'achievement-wise'. 1   If  education  was  a  major  'problem'  among  black youth,  then  the  high  and  disproportionate  incidence  of  unemployment 2 amongst black school-leavers in conjunction with the 'alarming levels' of homelessness among West Indians 3  were also cause for concern. The black 'second  generation'  had  become  the  'central  yardstick'  to  measure  race relations and immigration policies.

Given  these  circumstances,  throughout  the  1970s,  young  Blacks  were increasingly being linked with criminality. Blacks, as far as the police in the London area were concerned, were usually found to be over-represented in every main category of crime. 'Mugging' was liberally used in relation to the criminality of black youth living in the multi-deprived, inner city areas.

The  media  accentuated  mugging  very  often  by  depicting  the  victims  as 'white  and  helpless',  when  the  truly  victimised  were  the  Blacks  in  the decaying  inner  city  areas.  Thus,  mugging  introduced  'racially  directed' crime. Black youth had become a social problem and as far as the state was concerned, control was  necessary. Therefore, heavier sentences were imposed  by  the  courts  and  the  'sus'  law  was  vigorously  enforced  by  the police.

Relations between the police and black youth and, in general, the black community had deteriorated considerably throughout the 1960s and 1970s, so  that  by  the  beginning  of  the  1980s  the  situation  had  become  one  of serious concern. This entire period was frequently punctuated by incidents of police harassment of black youth. The oppressor and the oppressed were confronted  with  each  other,  for  example,  at  the  explosive  Notting  Hill carnival.

The Notting Hill explosion had served, at least for those who knew, as a public warning of the crisis of black youth. In its 1980 study entitled 'The Fire Next Time', the Community Relations Commission warned of the total alienation  of  black  youth  from  society.  The  state,  however,  had  already begun to draw a clear link between race and law and order. Surrounded by the system, and particularly in the persons of the law-enforcers, black youth had to find a way out.

During  the  1970s  the  stark  fact  remained  that  black  youth  as  underachievers at school were unemployed and disillusioned with their prospects in British society. As part of the black working class, they were alienated, the  direct  result  of  the  precise  and  cumulative  effect  of  British  policymakers. Black youths understood through hard experience that colour was the  major  determinant  of  their  alienation.  Their  parents'  culture  had  been subsumed  by  the  state,  through  an  integrative  policy  employing  various controlling agencies.

Educationally, while the struggle for O levels and CSEs continues, few West  Indian  youths  make  it  through  the  system.  The  selective  systems which  operate  within  schools  appear  to  operate  systematically  against Blacks. Predictably, the upholders of the system have attempted to explain such selection as due to the hereditary qualities of the Blacks. However, on the question of the process of socialisation and acculturation, other factors come up for consideration. The fact remains that in using English culture at all,  let  alone  in  trying  to  do  well  in  it,  the  West  Indian  child  (unlike  the

Punjabi child) faces unique difficulties in that there is no alternative culture to turn to at home. Indeed, both the culture of his home and school devalue black people and their achievements. Thus, starting with a low self-image, the child faces selective processes  which  present  a  further  sense  of inadequacy.  If  such  tests  are  difficult  enough  for  the  white  working  class child  to  cope  with,  imagine  how  much  more  difficult  it  could  be  for  the West Indian child.

Thus, more often than not, the West Indian child ends up in remedial or disciplinary  class  situations  and  once  there,  it  is  likely  that  the  process becomes cumulative because teachers' stereotypes of West Indian children have  tended  to  become  the  basis  for  further  processes  of  selection.  For many West Indian children, therefore, it appears that the system is loaded against  them,  and  they  take  refuge  in  a  culture  which  urges  them  to  take pride in their own black culture, while treating school as a process which one  endures.  Given  this  negative  low  self-image,  Rastafarianism,  among other things, has tended to uplift and restore the self-esteem of black school children tagged as 'remedials' and 'low streamers'.

Moreover,  rejection  in  the  selective  process  is  only  one  of  many breaches  with  society  that  the  West  Indian  child  experiences.  The  others may  be  with  the  family  and  later,  with  the  world  of  work,  if  they  were fortunate to get it. Unlike the Asian family which makes a break between even young adults and their parents virtually impossible (although there is evidence of growing conflict between them) the link between a young West Indian male and his parents is relatively weak.

Significantly, whether or not young Blacks succeed educationally, they are  likely  to  suffer  a  similar  experience  of  rejection  when  they  seek employment. Discrimination against young working-class Blacks is widespread at all levels of employment. The alternatives to employment are joining the 'hustlers' or turning  to the political/religious teaching  of Rastafarianism.

Young men and women do not normally turn to religious movements for explanations of their rejection and their deviance. If they are to be affected by  ideas  such  as  Rastafarianism,  there  must  be  some  medium  through which  ideas  reach  them.  That  medium  is  reggae  music.  Apart  from  its rhythms and its themes, they also receive a political message which relates to their oppression. The word 'Babylon' conveys the powerful message of 'four hundred years of slavery', as well as the immediate injustices of the

selective system to which they are subjected. In effect, it approximates the function  which  the  slogan  Black  Power  performed  for  young  Blacks  in Britain and the United States in the 1960s.

Before the 1970s, the Rastafarian movement was relatively unknown in Britain. A deepening of Third World impoverishment and black 'colonisation' in Britain led inevitably to self-examination  and  black history.  Marcus  Garvey,  the  founder  and  leader  of  the  Universal  Negro Improvement Association  sought  the  return  of  all  black  people  to Africa. But Garvey never publicly acknowledged the legitimacy of the Rastafarian enterprise nor the divinity of the Emperor Haile Selassie I, Ras Tafari, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, the all-conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah. In fact, after the invasion of Abyssinia, Garvey described Haile Selassie as 'a great  coward'  who  ran  away  from  his  country  and  of  playing  white.   He 4 also  castigated  the  Emperor  for  being  the  ruler  of  a  country  where  black men were chained and flogged. However, Garvey who taught the black man to see beauty in himself, saw in his message a lingering influence. He said, 'Be assured I planted well the seed of Negro or black nationalism.'

This separation in education has led to strong social solidarity among working-class school children. They expressed themselves strongly in the popular arts and in popular sports. Outside the schools, the police assumed, almost as their fundamental activity, the control and at times harassment of the young who demonstrated their support for football teams and pop music stars.  In  time,  they  came  to  be  called  hooligans  and  vandals.  If  white working-class  youth  experiencing  a  popular  culture  appear  as  a  threat, young West  Indian  Blacks  seem  even  more  threatening  to  the  authorities and to white working-class people.

## Black youth in Babylon

As Garveyism spread in Jamaica, Garvey was cast in the role of prophet by early Rastafarian leaders who utilised his 'Back to Africa' movement. Thus, thousands of Rastafarians prepared to journey back to the African 'fatherland',  an  act  expected  to  free  the  Rastas  from  the  white  man's domination, referred  to  as  Babylon. As  yet,  this  exodus  to Africa  has  not materialised and Babylon remains oppressive and intact. By the late 1970s, the vision of a redeemed Africa had spread to the inner city areas of Britain, as thousands of black youths adopted new modes of defiance. Through this

life  style,  they  widened  the  gap  between  the  first  and  second  generation Blacks in Britain.

Unlike their parents, black youths were drawn  by a 'messianic consummation of history', through a new style: wearing 'dreadlocks' and the Tam in the national colours of Ethiopia - red, green and black. Their rejection  of  British  society  draws  them  closer  to Africa  and  the  Jamaican patois (witness the life style of the Moss Side 'bluebeat' society of the late 1960s). Symbolically, it engendered a feeling of brotherhood for all Blacks. Already  alienated,  they  resisted the influence  of Babylon.  Thus,  the Rastafarian movement reflected the qualitatively different life experiences of the black immigrants, particularly Jamaicans and their children.

Significantly,  however,  the  black  youths'  indulgence  was  (and  is)  no escapist  fantasy.  Indeed,  it  became  a  lived  experience.  Their  commitment was real, an open rejection of British society. The contrasting life styles and beliefs  of  first  and  second  generation  West  Indians  was  a  reflection  of profound  changes  in  consciousness.  But  how  did  black  youths  become progressively involved in the movement immersing themselves in the Rasta system to the point where they accepted the divinity of Jah Ras Tafari and, by  implication,  the  inevitability  of  a  return  to  Africa.  According  to  one writer, black youths who engage in the process of becoming a Rastaman go through  four  broad  phases:  first,  the  apprehension  of  racial  disadvantage; secondly, the loss of plausibility of parents' beliefs; thirdly, the drift to Ras Tafari; and fourthly, the acceptance of Haile Selassie. In spite of a few 'road blocks', since the early 1970s, there was an increase in the number of black youths  who  (with  varying  interests)  were  able  to  carry  through  this journey. 5

Along the road to Jah, the black school-leaver gets the full devastating blast  of  racialism  in  employment.  For  the West  Indian  youth,  it  is  argued that  the  process  of  alienation  begins  during  the  later  stages  of  secondaryschool education. For it is during these years that they come to realise that their colour is a liability in the eyes of the society and that it is often used as a  basis  for  exclusion  and  rejection.  Thus,  the  experiences  of  other  black people, relations, friends and indeed, members of their own family leave a deep and lasting impression.

One  major  experience  of  racism  is  related  to  confrontations  with  the police in their day-to-day whereabouts in their communities, and also at the annual Notting Hill carnival. Police harassment and brutality were recurring

experiences  for  black  youths.  Consequently,  the  apprehension  of  racial disadvantage  sparked  off  a  pattern  of  events  which  gave  the  necessary credibility to a British Rastafarian movement.

Both parents and children realised that there was no entry into positions of  authority  and  prestige,  for  example,  because  of  skin  colour.  In  their 'exile'  in  Britain,  blackness  has  become  their  common  identity;  their separateness was clear.

Although their parents' beliefs and religion began to lose its significance,  there  was  no  outright  rejection  of  them.  Nonetheless,  their readiness to accept an alternative resulted in an increasing importance of the Rastafarian-inspired  reggae  music,  through  which  the  Rastas  built  their beliefs  and  through  which  they  constructed  a  world  view.  Rastafarianism made sense to black youths particularly because it put into perspective their parents' views.

Pervasive  racialism  in  all  aspects  of  British  society  pushed  more  and more black  youths  to  the  acceptance  of  Rastafarianism  and  opposition  to Babylon. In the 1970s, Bob Marley's reggae music made a powerful impact on black youths in Britain. This music was an important starting point in that it  brought insight on several broad issues. Thus a process of learning was set in motion. The acquisition of knowledge bred further questioning and  a  movement  away  from  their  parents'  British-based  culture.  Helping them along on their journey to Jah was their music. From their communities in Britain, Africa beckoned.

Their parents' lack of pride in their African ancestry was in contrast to the total acceptance of Africa by these youths. The quest for the 'true self the 'I and I' and their 'African roots' were paramount concerns. In effect, membership  of the Rastafarian movement  directed the black youth, alienated from the host society, closer to the acceptance of Selassie I as God Almighty. For the deprived young Black, the brotherhood of Rastafarianism was  a  'morally  uplifting  experience'.  Given  that  there  was  simply  no alternative, enslavement  in  Babylon  had  to  be  resisted.  In  accepting Rastafarianism  then,  the  Rastaman  acknowledged  the  unity  of  Rastas through  the  bond  of  God,  with  an  unshakeable  conviction  that  the  white man's domination was at an end, that Babylon will be destroyed.

The  decade  of  the  1970s  then  led  to  a  phenomenal  growth  of  the Rastafarian  movement,  with  the  acceptance  of  Haile  Selassie  becoming perhaps  the  most  important  feature  of  the  young  West  Indians  beginning

their  journey  to  Jah.  In  effect,  Rastafarianism  had  instilled  in  the  young Black a sense of real brotherhood. Moreover, acceptance of Selassie has led to marked changes in consciousness, widening the gap over a period of one generation  between  the  original  immigrants  and  the  young  Rastas  who perceived the racism inherent in the social, economic  and political structures of British society, and took a tangential course to Jah instead. To the Rastaman, integration was, and is, unworkable.

Having accepted Jah, the actual life and practice of the young Rastas is 'complex',  particularly  to  those  who  do  not  care  to  understand.  For example, young Rastas may live in squats and smoke ganga, but they also read  the  Bible.  The  Rasta  life  style  has  its  own  meanings  and  its  own religious  significance,  as  is  the  case  with  the  mainstream  Rastafarian Church  or  the  Pentecostal  and  Holiness  Churches.  But,  unlike  these churches  which  can  be  co-opted  into  mainstream  life,  the  Rastas  of  the streets remain stubbornly separated.

## Racism and sexism

## The young black female's predicament and struggle

For young black females, the relationship between education, paid employment  and  power  is  important.  Their  parents'  view  was  put  into context by the Organisation of Women of Asian and African Descent thus:

The dream of a good education for their children has always had a particular significance  for  black  people.  White  colonialists  fed generations of Asians, Africans and West Indians the myth that the reason  they  were  being  savagely  economically  exploited  was  not because  of  race  or  class  but  because  they  were  backward,  underdeveloped,  uneducated.  The  old  colonialist  equation  of  education power explains why so many black parents passionately wanted for their children the education they never had.

In linking education with future earning power, Prescod-Roberts suggested why 'girls'  in  the  Caribbean  may  be  supported  by  their  family  to  pursue educational  qualifications.  She  took  the  view  that  the  sexual  division  of labour and responsibility within the family binds women more strongly and

permanently  into  family  responsibilities  than  it  does  men,  thus  making women the better migrants from the perspective of those left behind. It is clear therefore that such power as women obtain is directly channelled into one institution in which women's power is sanctioned - the family. Their positive  identity  is  female  but  a  belief  that  in  Britain  and  the  Caribbean women were often accorded less than their due meant that girls were angry at  the  foreclosing  of  options  available  to  them.  Instead  of  engendering apathy  and  despair,  the  girls  remained  persistent  and  resourceful.  Indeed, the struggle of black women  had become one of persistence and resourcefulness. These  have  been  common  themes.  Furthermore,  this  is  a statement of a continuing double-subordination of black women.

Regardless  of  the  girls'  undeniable  strength  and  perseverance,  even  if their  ambitions  are  realised,  they  are  not  about  to  become  part  of  a privileged elite. A labour market which is largely sex-segregated and which operates differential rates of pay for women and men, means that the only edge  which  the  black  girls  may  have  over  black  boys  is  that  their  paper qualifications  may  give  them  the  option  of  obtaining  their  lower  wages through  shorter  hours  of  work  and  in  possibly  more  congenial  working conditions.

Commenting  on  the  fact  that  matrifocality  can  and  does  exist  within essentially patriarchial social formations, Fuller argues that 'black women in  Britain  and  the  USA  are  faced  with  just  such  a  situation.  Matrifocality may allow women to develop with a definition of femininity that includes strength, competence and so on which enables them to challenge patriarchal relations  of  sexual  dominations  but  it  does  not  thereby  do  away  with patriarchy.' 6

## Asian (Pakistani and Indian) 'girls'

Asian girls (like Asian boys) not only face the language problem at school, but are also made to feel that being an Asian is a 'disadvantage'. Given that the structure  of primary  education  in  Britain  is  implicitly  racist,  for example, in the books used, the curriculum and the teachers' attitudes, this serves  to  reinforce  this  disadvantage.  While  some  school  teachers  take  a strong  anti-racist  line,  they  remain  very  much  the  exceptions  waging  an unsuccessful fight against the racism of the school system.

Asian  children  in  schools,  surrounded  by  white  figures  of  authority, quickly realise their disadvantaged position. Indeed, they are made to feel

embarrassed  when  their  parents,  who  are  unable  to  express  themselves adequately  in  English,  try  to  talk  to  teachers.  The  laughter  and  derision aroused among pupils, both black and white, pushes the Asian child into a sense  of  isolation.  In  this  predicament,  as  one  observer  put  it,  'what  the child faces is a kind of colonial experience which they are far too young to fight against. The children under eleven I spoke to almost invariably had a sense of inferiority similar to that of colonised people. They were ashamed of  anything  Indian.  They  disowned  their  food  and  their  language  and  in some cases even their Indian first  names. A  few  tried  to  make  even  their skin as inconspicuous as possible - as white as possible.'

Yet  as  Indian  children  grow  older,  these  'racist  opinions'  are  altered dramatically by their experiences. Remarks about food, curry for example, lacerate  their  tender  sensibilities.  They  receive  broadsides  from  several fronts - for their colour, their food and their religion. And what is more they begin to see themselves as inferior.

According to Amrit Wilson, an Indian writer,

Children between eight and twelve seem too young to fight against cultural racism in school; it is as though they are almost stunned into accepting the inferiority with which white society has labelled them. But  at  twelve  their  feelings  seem  to  change.  It  is  not  that  racism vanishes  -  in  fact  it  intensifies  and  violence  increases,  but  most children  start  to  face  up  to  it  at  this  point,  and  their  'inferiority' usually  clears  away.  After  all,  when  racism  takes  the  form  of violence, they can't fail to recognise it as an attack on themselves and part of a value system they cannot go along with. 7

In schools in the Harlesden area, there were three social groups: West Indian,  English  and  Irish,  and  Asian.  One  girl  said,  'There  is  hostility between West Indians and English … they don't mix much, they keep apart, though  sometimes  there  are  fights.  But  attacks  on  Asian  girls  are  much more  common.' According  to  these  girls,  apart  from  the  violence,  it  was difficult to be friendly with white girls. 8

Some East African Asian girls felt that West Indians sometimes behaved as  though  they  are  superior  to  Asians,  'because  Asians  are  religious  or because  Asians  can't  speak  English  well'.  A  counterargument  was  that 'Indian children are only reacting to the insufferable cultural superiority that

Asians  feel.  Indian  culture  is  a  big  barrier  and  they  make  it  more  so  by always thinking they are superior.' While there is truth in both opinions, it was also argued that it was a 'matter of style'. As a white secondary school teacher  put  it,  'In  the  eyes  of  children,  West  Indians  have  it  and  Asians don't. When a West Indian boy walks in, the girls look up; they don't do that for an Asian. In our school there is no doubt there is a hierarchy. The West Indians are at the top and the Asians are at the bottom.'

Be that as it may, the overriding reason for conflict must be the British education  system  itself,  'with  its  essentially  ethnocentric  curriculum,  its apathy, its built in attitude that Western culture is the only culture and its pervasive mockery of people who are 'different''. 9

Asian girls are faced with a real dilemma. At school they have (with no one to turn to except each other) to endure bullying and racism. When they get home nothing is said about racism. As one girl put it, 'everyone is tired in the evenings and we don't like to talk about it.' More tellingly though, many girls from orthodox Muslim and Sikh families feel that even if they did  tell  their  parents,  they  would  not  understand.  Thus  criticism  of  the school  system  in  these  circumstances  would  be  'not  only  pointless  but risky'.

Asian girls also have to face their parents' attitudes to education which 'vary tremendously with religion, background in Pakistan or India, and, of course, with the people involved'. Without consultation some parents tend to  map out the careers of their daughters, pressuring these girls in almost impossible situations. One Gujarati girl said: 'My parents, and most Asian parents, they live for their children. Everything they do is for their children. They have so many hopes and dreams for their children's future. When it doesn't come out the way they want it to, that is when they get most hurt I think.…' 10

In extreme cases, the daughter's education is irrelevant. Between these two extremes, most parents do not show much interest in their daughters' school life. Indeed they discourage them from entering higher education. In the case of Muslim  girls, the demands  of Islam conflict with the requirements of the school system. For example, the Koran's teaching that arms and legs must always be covered makes the wearing of school uniform a difficult problem. This raises the questions of nakedness which some girls were brought up to think of as 'undesirable, even immoral', and of course,

sex education in school. Most Pakistani mothers were against sex education. 11

Torn in a conflict between their parents' culture, language and religion, and the host country, on the one hand, and the inherent racism of the British school system, on the other, Indian and Pakistani girls, whatever education they  manage  to  achieve,  prepare  for  the  post-school  threat  or  prospect  of marriage which begins 'to loom over her, casting a blight over her chances of  further  education'. 12 While  Hindu  girls  from  an  urban  background  are most likely to study or at least to continue their courses after marriage, for Muslim  or  Sikh  girls  higher  education  can  rarely  be  achieved  without struggle.' Indeed, many families feel that marriage is preferable to a college career and that higher education is 'dangerous', 'destructive' and 'potentially immoral'. 13

The struggle for freedom in the school rooms, in many cases, pales into insignificance  when  compared  with  the  restrictions  placed  upon  them during  adolescence  and  eventually  in  marriage.  The  potential  for  revolt among these Asian girls and women is great. For in spite of their differences in  life  style,  Wilson's  findings  show  (i)  that  although  they  come  from  so many different parts of the Indian sub-continent and have so many different religions, it is clear that as women they face a special kind of oppression; (ii) that they are also united by racism in Britain; and (iii) that because of their  exploitation  as  a  class,  most  of  them,  even  those  who  were  middle class before had become working class. Wilson concludes:

What struck me was that all these three things together affected the outlook of these women and it wasn't possible to separate them. You might think of yourself as just a person, maybe with a husband or parents or children, but when you step out of your door you know that you will be looked at by other people as just an Asian woman a black woman. As for class - immigrants come basically because of jobs, of money; so all the women, even those who don't go out to work,  are  conscious  of  their  class.  They  are  conscious  of  their families being working class. One could put it this way - they may feel  that  when  oppressed  as  women  they  are  being  oppressed  as individuals, but racism is an attack on them as part of their family

and community, and these things cannot be separated in the identity of a woman. 14

## Black feminist responses

Given the government's apparent concern over the discriminatory practices and the disadvantages of the black working class, particularly as it related to black youth by the 1970s, the issue of race had become a major topic of debate within sections of the black working class in Britain.

In  raising  the  level  of  black  consciousness,  black  feminists,  for  long ignored by the Women's Liberation Movement, addressed white feminists as to the boundaries of sisterhood in the struggle. In response to the white feminists' emphasis of patriarchy as being the main source of oppression, black feminists feel the need for a redefinition of the term since 'Racism ensures  that  black  men  do  not  have  the  same  relations  to  patriarchal capitalist hierarchies as white men.' The Combahee River Collective argue:

We believe that  sexual  politics  under  patriarchy  is  as  pervasive  in black  women's lives as are the politics  of  class  and  race. We  also often  find  it  difficult  to  separate  race  from  class  and  from  sex oppression  because  in  our  lives  they  are  most  often  experienced simultaneously. We know that there is such a thing as racial-sexual oppression which is neither solely racial nor solely sexual, e.g. the history  of  rape  of  black  women  by  white  men  as  a  weapon  of political oppression.

As feminists and lesbians, they feel solidarity with progressive black men and  do  not  advocate  the  factionalisation  that  white  women  who  are separatists demand.  Black  people,  they  argued,  necessitated  solidarity around the fact of race, which white women of course do not need to have with  white  men,  unless  it  concerned  their  negative  solidarity  as  racial oppressors. Therefore, 'We struggle together with black men against racism, while we also struggle with black men about sexism.' 15

Black feminists, alienated by the non-recognition of their 'herstories' in the WLM, are demanding that racism be acknowledged as a 'restructuring feature' of their relationships with white women. They argue that in theory and practice, the white feminist must recognise that white women stand in a

power  relation  as  oppressors  of  black  women.  Given  this  'theory  and practice' simple equality was out of the question.

The three concepts central to the feminist theory which posed problems when  applied  to  black  women's  lives  are  the  family,  patriarchy  and reproduction.  Too  often  they  have  been  placed  in  the  context  of  white (middle-class) women,  thus  becoming  contradictory  to  the  lives and experiences of black women.

While accepting that the family can be a source of oppression for black women,  the  black  family  has  also  been  a  prime  source  of  resistance  to oppression. The need to recognise the historical dimensions of the struggle was necessary. During slavery and periods of colonialism the black family was the basis of political and cultural resistance to racism. Further, it was argued  that  'Ideologies  of  black  female  sexuality  do  not  stem  primarily from the black family. The way the gender of black women is constructed differs from constructions of white femininity because it is also subject to racism.' 16

Day  to  day,  black  women  in  Britain  have  been,  and  are,  constantly challenging  the  racist  ideologies  of  black  female  sexuality.  For  example, Asian schoolgirls are resisting the racist mythology of their femininity. The belief that Asian girls will be forced into marriage immediately after leaving school perpetuates the racist attitude that Asian women in career jobs are a waste  of  time.  Consequently,  careers  officers  do  not  offer  them  the  same interviews  and  job  opportunities  as  white  girls.  The  struggle  against  the racism  of  the  careers  service  is  but  only  one  aspect  of  the  Asian  girls' struggle in schools. 17

The concept of dependency is also a problem for black feminists. If this concept provides the link between  the 'material organisation of the household,  and  the  ideology  of  femininity'  how  can  the  situations  be explained in which black women, as heads of households are not financially dependent upon a black man? This has been the case in both colonial and metropolitan  situations.  The  historical legacy  reveals  that systems  of slavery, colonialism and imperialism have denied black men positions in the white  male  hierarchy.  Moreover,  black  men  have  been  oppressed  by  the terror employed in these systems. 18

Black feminists also sought to clarify the concept of 'reproduction' and how it relates to two basic questions: how the black woman's role in rural,

industrial or domestic labour affects the construction of ideologies of black female  sexuality which  are different from, and  often constructed in opposition to, white female sexuality and how this role relates to the black woman's struggle for control over her own sexuality.

The  'herstory'  of black  women  in  post-war  Britain  points  to  an interesting contradiction  between  'home-making  as  a  career'  and  the campaign to recruit women  into the labour force during post-war reconstruction. The recruitment of black women remains unmentioned. The tendency was not to separate male and female black workers. Instead a list was given of  the  industries  and  services  where  labour  was  most  urgently required. The boot and shoe industry, clothing, textiles, iron and steel, all required female workers, as did hospitals, domestic service, transport and the women's land army. There was also a shortage of shorthand typists, and a dire shortage of nurses and midwives. 19

This  bald  statement  shed  no  light  as  to  why  black  women  were concentrated  in  certain  work  areas  more  than  in  others.  However,  as temporary workers in a period of crisis they did not threaten the traditional division  of  labour  industry  along  'sex  lines'.  Indeed,  the  survey  (the economic survey of 1947) reflected the dominant view that married women 'would not naturally wish to work'.

But,  not  all  black  women  were  subject  to  this  process.  Ideologically Afro-Caribbean  women  were  'naturally'  suited  for  the  lowest-paid,  most menial jobs. These black women  bridged  the division between the alternatives 'work and marriage' and of being two kinds of women, a wife and  a  mother.  Rather  than  being  perceived  as  involved  in  a  desperate struggle to protect and preserve the black family in Britain, black women were  seen  to  fail as mothers  precisely  because  of  their position as workers. 20

Furthermore, there was the problem of the black woman's struggle to gain control over her own sexuality when faced with the racist experiment of enforced sterilisation. Black feminists have criticised white feminists for ignoring their experiences and struggles both before and after they came to Britain.  This  was  not  surprising  since  the  black  woman's  experience, steeped in racism and sexism, was necessarily different from those of white women.

Carby argues that the spoils of economic exploitation of the colonies not only benefited the plantation mistresses, but, in various degrees, all white women  in Britain. Moreover, the pro-imperialist attitudes of many nineteenth  century  and  early  twentieth  century  feminists  and  suffragists have  yet  to  be  acknowledged  for  their  racist  implications  and  so  to  the exploration of contemporary racism within the white feminist movement in Britain.

In constructing alternatives, Hazel Carby  adds  that it should be imperative  for  feminist  'herstory'  and  theory  to  avoid  reproducing  the structural inequalities which  exist between  the 'metropoles' and the 'peripheries', and within the metropoles between black and white women, in  the  form  of  inappropriate  polarisations  between  the  'First'  and  'Third World', developed-underdeveloped or advanced-backward.

Moreover,  it  is  very  important  that  white  women  in  the  women's movement examine the ways in which racism excludes many black women and  prevents  them  from  unconditionally  aligning  themselves  with  white women.  Instead  of  taking  black  women  as  the  objects  of  their  research, white  feminist  researchers  are  directed  to  uncover  the  gender-specific mechanisms  of  racism  amongst  white  women  since  'this  more  than  any other factor disrupts the recognition of common interests of sisterhood'. 21

Indeed,  there  have  been  many  instances  of  racial  oppression  at  work from white women. Asian women, for example, 'are paid low salaries and everything is worse for them, they have to face the insults of supervisors. These supervisors are all English women. The trouble is that in Britain our women  are  expected  to  behave  like  servants  and  we  are  not  used  to behaving  like  servants  and  we  can't.  But  if  we  behave  normally  …  the supervisors  start  shouting  and  harassing  us  …  They  complain  about  us Indians to the Manager.' 22

Black women resist being grafted onto feminism in a tokenistic manner. They  argue  that  feminism  has  to  be  transformed  if  it  is  to  address  them. Neither do they wish their words to be misused in generalities as if what each one of them utters represents the total experience of all black women.

## Gender, race and class

In  the  debate  on  the  unhappy  marriage  between  Marxism  and  feminism, Gloria Joseph has pointed out that:

the feminist question has never truly embraced 'Black women' and that 'incestuous child of patriarchy and capitalism', namely racism, is  not  acknowledged.  [Given  this  serious  omission,  it  is  necessary that] in discussion of Marxism and the woman question, to speak to women, all women categorically, is to perpetuate white supremacy white female supremacy - because it is white women to whom the comments  are  addressed  and  to  whom  the  comments  are  most appropriate. 23

In  short,  the  WLM  has  failed  to  recognise  the  specificity  of  black women's experiences of racism, structured  by  racially  constructed  gender roles.  In  this  respect,  the Asian  woman's  experience  in  relation  to  waged work is of particular interest.

## Migration and gender

Fundamentally 'the  state  takes  on  new  tasks;  first  of  all  economically  by regulating  the ebb  and  flow  of  foreign  labour  power  and  then  also politically  by  finding  and  carrying  out  new  means  of  direct  and  indirect political  oppression,  and  finally  ideologically  by  trying  to  integrate,  on  a non-political basis, the immigrant workers selected to stay'. 24

The  fact  that  migrant  workers  play  an  important  economic  role  in advanced capitalist economies has led to massive research into this 'role' and on the political and social effects of large immigrant settlements in the major  urban  centres  in  most  European  countries.  In  Britain,  the  field  of 'race relations' has been reponsible for several studies on housing, employment  and  education  as  large  numbers  of  black  workers  came  to Britain  during  the  1950s  and  1960s. 25 Not  surprisingly  there  has  been  an absence  of  gender-specific  studies  dealing  with  migrant  women  who constituted an integral part of this population.

## Migration and the state

The  extent  of  immigration  and  the  strategic  role  of  immigration  in  the European  economy  have  to  be  explained,  not  in  terms  of  the  technical demands of production but by the specific interests of capital in a particular

phase  of  its  development.  Given  that  primary  immigration  was  declining without the aid of controls:

the threat of controls caused a wave of 'panic immigration' to 'beat the  ban'  [in  1962].  …  many  Pakistani  and  Indian  women  and children  came  to  Britain  to  join  their  husbands  and  fathers.  In contrast to West Indian women, the majority of Asian women came to Britain as the dependants of male workers. In fact, Asian women were never drawn into the metropolis as wage labourers. They were not recruited directly as cheap labourers as were Asian men, whose migration to Britain from the subcontinent was closely linked to the post-war economic boom …

The forces and motivations behind Asian women's migration to Britain were different and their entry was circumscribed by different state  policies  and  strategies.  On  the  other  hand,  the  East  African Asian men and women who came to Britain in 1967 were nearly all British  passport  holders  who  were  forced  out  of  East Africa  when the former British colonies gained independence. In 1968 the British Government  moved  in  very  quickly  to  try  and  control  this  new source  of  immigration  to  Britain  by  altering  their  legal  rights  of entry.  A  voucher  system  was  introduced  whereby  vouchers  were issued to heads of households, normally males, for themselves and certain  categories  of  dependants.  Here,  the  dependent  status  of women  was  clear.  Women  holding  British  passports  had  great difficulty in proving they were heads of households; though widowed,  divorced  and  deserted  women  as  well  as  those  with dependent  husbands,  came  into  this  category.  Thus  from  the  very beginning Asian  women  have  been  discriminated  against  not  only because  they  are  black  but  also  as  women  in  terms  of  their  legal rights of entry and settlement. 26

Both 'black labour' and 'female labour' are regarded as cheap. Indeed, the value of domestic labour carried out by women in Western industrialised countries  has  been  reckoned  to  be  approximately  one-third  of  the  gross national product. Parmar states:

When looking at the advantages to Metropolitan capital of importing exclusively  male  labour  power  (whereby  there  is  a  saving  on  the cost of reproduction) it is important to assess the role played by the wives and children of male migrants in the maintenance and renewal of their families. … Without doubt the domestic labour of women in Third  World  countries  greatly  subsidises  the  cost  of  reproducing male labour in the cities, mines and other centres of production. 27

Thus, Asian families and Asian women have been particularly affected by the repressive effects of 'racist and patriarchical immigration legislation'. Indeed, state racism had grown. In Britain the Asian community  has  been  subjected  to  abuse  and  humiliation  by  the  process whereby  Asian  women  before  arriving  in  Britain  are  exposed  to  British racism by having to undergo 'long and vigorous' interviews in the British embassies in London, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and the ordeal of answering intimate questions. In 1978, for example, 'there was an expose of the vaginal examinations carried out on Asian women to determine whether they were married or not, and to determine whether they were fiancees of men  already  settled  in  England  …  Examinations  to  'prove'  whether  a woman is a  virgin  can  only  be  seen  as  acts  of  violence  and  intimidation against black women by the British state.'

This  'testing'  is  based,  according  to  Parmar,  on  the  racist  and  sexist assumption  that Asian  women  from  the  sub-continent  are  always  virgins before  they  get  married  and  that  it  is  'not  in  their  culture  for  women  to engage in sexual activity before marriage'. 28 This kind of absurd generalisation, she argues, is based on the same stereotype of the submissive,  weak  and  tradition-bound  Asian  woman.  The  fact  that  the immigration officers administer them quite haphazardly on pregnant Asian women is only one example of the racism not only of individual officers but also  the  structural  and  institutional  racism  of  the  British  state.  Such practices also indicate the direct control the state intended to have on Asian women's sexuality.

One  of  the  effects  of  the 1971  Immigration  Act  and  subsequent legislation has been to break up Asian families. The 1981 Nationality Act put  further  constraints  on  the  right  of  dependants  to  join  their  families  in Britain. One of the most obvious threats posed by this was to the future of black families and black culture. This trend can be traced back to the 1978

parliamentary  select  committee.  One  of  its  recommendations  was  that children aged over 12 born abroad to those settled in Britain would not be allowed in to join their parents.

Parmar concludes:

The  ways  in  which  capital,  patriarchy  and  race  structure  Asian women's oppression and exploitation, does not make it possible or desirable to separate out the primary cause of oppression; all three factors are intrinsic to the day-to-day experiences of Asian women. The stereotypes and myths that exist about Asian women are being constantly challenged through the militant actions that many of them have taken in the past and will continue to take in the future. The collective actions that they have taken have sometimes  been alongside their white sisters and at other times they have struggled alongside  their  black  brothers.  They  have  learnt  that  while  it  is necessary for them as black women to struggle with white women on  issues  of  mutual  concern  and  with  black  men  against  their common oppression  as  black  people,  they  have  to  do  this  from  a position of strength and power as organised black women. As black women  they  are  successfully  defining  their  own  experiences  of oppression  and  developing  their  own  framework  for  struggling against it. 29

## The oppressor: Blacks and the police

The debate on 'sus'

On 28 August 1981, the Criminal Attempts Act came into force and created a new offence of 'vehicle interference'. The use by the police of the 'being a suspected person' or 'sus' charge, has resulted in a great deal of bitterness among black people against the police. Moreover, it has become part of a wider controversy regarding civil liberties and the extent of police powers. 30

From the figures on 'sus', it is clear that proportionately more Blacks are  arrested  than  Whites.  Mindful  of  this  and  in  their  own  defence,  the police took the view that the figures do not represent a bias against black youth but that the arrests for 'sus' reflect the relative involvement of various

groups in that category of street crime. Roberts argued, 'Presumably, if the number of Blacks arrested for 'sus' begins to decline (and in proportion to other groups) this merely shows their declining involvement rather than any change in police discretion or policy.' The Haringey Community Relations Council  has  noted  that  the  proportion  of  black  people  arrested  for  'sus' declined from 47 per cent in 1977 to 10 per cent in 1978 of total arrests. 31

These figures will, however, bring us nowhere nearer a full understanding  unless  'sus'  is  seen  in  the  context  of  the  history  of  Blackpolice  relations.  For  one  thing,  this  charge  by  the  police  has  created bitterness and resentment in the black community. Incidents of malpractice have exacerbated relations with the police. Examples given by the Institute of  Race  Relations  include  disregard  of  the  Judges  Rules,  the  inadequate investigation  of  racial  attacks,  the  abuse  of  the  power  to  enter  homes, harassment of juveniles to accept guilt,  and  the  swamping  by  the  Special Patrol Group of areas where black people are concentrated.

The  black  community's  hostility  and  resentment  towards  the  police today must be seen in historical perspective. During the 1960s and 1970s there  had  been  a  steady  increase  in  the  number  of  complaints  against  the police.  In  view  of  this,  in  1971  a  Select  Committee  of  the  House  of Commons was set up to look into these complaints and the general concern regarding police-Black relations. Clearly, from the evidence given by both the black community and the police organisations, relations between black youths and the police were very bad.

In their use of the 'sus' charge, the police have denied any bias against black  people.  Yet  they  persist  in  linking  black  youths  with  crime.  For example, David McNee, the Commander of the Metropolitan Police, stated that  'law  and  order  in  the  capital  …  are  now  firmly  linked  to  matters  of race'. 32

## The police against the people

In September 1981, as unemployment approached 3 million there were no signs that the economic recession would 'bottom out' into better times. For the jobless the forecast was gloomy. In order to get registered unemployment  back  down  to  one  million  (as  it  was  in  1970)  it  was

estimated that 5 million extra jobs had to be created in the next three years. And this was regarded as an 'optimistic' forecast. 33

In the aftermath of the introduction of the microprocessor there was an assumption  of  'almost  a  third  of  the  potential  of  the  working  population being permanently unemployed', and to cope with this a highly authoritarian  regime  was  necessary.  This  mass  unemployment  had  been anticipated during the 1970s. By the end of the decade the police force was ready to put down any potential trouble as tension mounted particularly in the inner city areas. The police were invested with increased powers as their numbers increased. In 1980 the police force in England and Wales reached a record of 117,423. This was not surprising since Britain had 'proportionately  the  largest  prison  population  in  Western  Europe,  about 44,000 in 1982. 34 Moreover, Britain had been contending with 'civil war' in Northern  Ireland,  for  over  12  years.  As  it  was,  this  would  prove  good training for controlling and disciplining Britain's black communities. This growing  social  and  political  problem  marked  the  transition  from  'liberal democracy' to 'authoritarian democracy'. 35

## National security

By  1970  the  emphasis  was  on  national  security.  Unemployment  already stood at one million and the post-war social 'peace' was quickly shattered when the Heath government took on the trade union movement and defined the limits of trade union activity in the Industrial Relations Act 1971. The miners' 1972 strike was in defiance of the government. More than 30,000 miners  and  other  workers  had  gathered  to  block  the  entrance  to  the  coal depot  at  Saltley  in  Birmingham.  The  police,  outnumbered,  decided  to retreat.  The  government,  the  state  and  the  ruling  class  saw  this  mass defiance of 'law and order' not only as a challenge to their authority and the power structure, but also as a major defeat in trying to curb the power of trade unionists. This victory for the labour movement led to the state totally revising  its  'contingency  plans'.  The  Home  Secretary  set  up  the  National Security  Committee  to  review  all  aspects  of  maintaining  order.  Indeed, evidence of this tightening up process was apparent in the unprecedented police  presence  in  the  mining  communities  during  the  1984-85  miners' strike. (During the strike the author was informed by a black NUM officer that there were approximately 3,000 black members in the National Union of Mine workers.)

After the Labour Party was returned in 1974, under the aegis of a Social Contract, the working class was weakened and demoralised. In 1978, E. P. Thompson wrote:

[once]  the  libertarian  response  of  the  British  people  has  been brought under sedation, then the reasons for the invisibility  of  the state  within  the  state  began  to  lose  their  force. And  so  we  see  the evidence,  in  the  past  decade  of  the  police,  the  army,  the  security services  …  becoming  more  public,  engaging  in  active  'public relations', lobbying for new  curbs on civil rights and for a 'simplified'  legal  process  and  attempting  to  familiarise  the  public with their intrusive presence. 36

As Bunyan put it, this feature marked the transition from the 'old' order to  the  'new',  from  the  'liberal-democratic'  system  in  which  the  coercive state  agencies  played  a  key  role  to  an  'authoritarian-democratic'  system where these agencies move to the forefront.

After Saltley, two steps were taken: first, to strengthen the police in the community,  thus  altering  their  role  and  image.  As  a  second  step,  the Security  Services  were  strengthened.  Techniques  of  surveillance  were introduced,  to  reinforce  the  Security  Services.  Given  the  experience  in Northern Ireland (and the technological advances applied there), computerised record-keeping systems were developed.

The  'most  secret'  change,  however,  involved  the  military,  in  order  to deal with public order situations, beyond  'Bobby  capability' and  to intervene in strikes. This was done in the winter of 1977-78 when the army was  brought  in  during  the  national  firemen's  strike.  More  than  20,000 troops were used. It was the first time that the army replaced a workforce in Britain,  and  achieved  the  desired  end  -  the  defeat  of  the  strike. Another element in the new 'contingency' planning was the setting up of the Civil Contingency Unit in the Cabinet Office.

Largely hidden from public view, these moves, legitimised through the media,  marked  the  emergence  of  'authoritarian  democracy'.  The  police force was at the forefront of the move towards authoritarianism. Gone was the post-war image of the 'friendly Bobby'. Towards the end of the 1970s, the police had acquired a new image. In 1977 riot shields were introduced for the first time on mainland Britain, for example, at Lewisham in London

during  battles  between  the  police  and  anti-fascists  at  a  National  Front march, and later at the Notting Hill Carnival. Yet the police have continued to present themselves as a neutral force.

Amidst the general circumstances of recession, the police regarded the maintenance of public order as their ongoing, primary task. In 1980, James Anderton, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester said:

I think that from the police point of view … my task in the future, in the ten to fifteen years from now … that basic crime such as theft, burglary,  even  violent  crime  will  not  be  the  predominant  police feature. What will be the matter of greater concern to me will be the covert  and  ultimately  overt  attempts  to  overthrow  democracy,  to subvert the authority of the state, and to in fact involve themselves in acts of sedition designed to destroy our parliamentary system and the democratic government of this country. 37

Characteristic of the 'fire-brigade' strategy of policing was a tendency to 'over-react' and 'over-police' in a 'blatantly aggressive manner.' Moreover, consideration was given to a 'third force', a para-military police. In fact, they were tooling-up to face their biggest enemies, the disadvantaged, harassed and impoverished black communities. Such a force not  only  have  sophisticated  riot-control  equipment  (for  example,  water cannon,  CS  gas  and  armoured  personnel  carriers)  but  have  in  their  ranks specially trained experienced, armed marksmen to deal with riots, demonstrations and strikes. Earlier attempts to create such a force in Britain had been opposed. However, deliberation over the idea continued. The main argument  in  favour  of  a  third  force  was  that  the  aggressive  role  in conventional policing would be removed in dealing with public order, and thus help the police to maintain friendly relations with the public. But, the experience  of  some  European  countries  showed  that  more  hatred  and counter-violence  was  directed  at  riot  police  than  the  ordinary  police. 'Unlike  the  policemen  on  the  beat,  they  have  little  chance  to  mend  their fences  by  being  seen  as  friends  and  protectors  because  they  seldom  meet people until they become rioters.' 38

There  was  agreement,  however,  that  it  was  the  responsibility  of  the police to maintain public order generally. Riot training, however,

considered to be necessary, led to 'joint military exercises' being undertaken.

At least, in theory, the separate roles of the army and the police were to be  maintained.  In  practice,  however,  from  this  time  on,  the  role  of  the 'ordinary  policemen'  would  change.  One  approach  was  the  creation  of Special  Patrol  Groups  (SPGs)  in  the  major  cities.  Like  the  London  SPG, they  were  to  be  trained  in  riot  control  techniques.  But  why  retraining? Clearly the state was worried about the effects of the deepening recession on the black communities. From here on police tactics assumed a war-like approach as in Northern Ireland. Robert Mark, impressed by the techniques used by the Royal Ulster Constabulary had his 200 strong SPG trained in 'snatch squad' methods (to arrest ring leaders), 'flying wedges' (to break up crowds) and random stop-and-search and roadblock techniques, 'based on the army's experience in Ulster'. 39 In 1981, there were about 28 SPG-type groups  in  the  52  local  police  forces  in  the  United  Kingdom.  In  effect,  in almost  every  major  city  the  SPG  played  the  'dual  role  of  anti-crime  and paramilitary units'.

Notorious examples of the style of such 'third force' policing could be seen at the Red Lion Square demonstration in June 1974 when one of the protesters was  killed.  And  in  April  1979,  at the anti-National  Front demonstration in Southall, where a member of the SPG allegedly murdered Blair  Peach. 40 But,  it  seemed  local  SPGs  alone  were  unlikely  to  contain riots on the streets. Thus, Police Support Units were also created.

Already before the 'riots' in Bristol in April 1980, in Brixton in April 1981  and  nationally  in  July  1981,  the  contradiction  between  policing  the community and simultaneously forming a 'hidden' third force in the event of major trouble in the streets, was evident. The police were faced with two 'incompatible  and  irreconcilable  demands  placed  on  them  -  to  police  the community  in  the  normal  everyday  sense  and  to  act  as  Britain's  third force'. 41

But,  in  view  of  this  development,  what  of  community  policing?  John Alderson,  Chief  Police  Constable  of  Devon  and  Cornwall,  given  such overtly  oppressive  policing  stated,  'The  era  of  preventive  policing  is phasing out in favour of a responsive or reactive police.' According to him, the  trust  and  confidence  the  community  places  in  the  police  becomes  the main casualty with the police and the people likely to meet only in conflict

situations. This 'fire-brigade' policing in Britain's major cities, was likely to lead,  Alderson  argued,  to  policing  'more  akin  to  that  of  an  occupying army'. 42

The other  aspect  of  community  policing  of  concern  is  the  role  of  the police  officer  on  the  beat.  The  fact  that  part  of  their  training  is  to  gather intelligence on the people within their area and feed it through to their local police  station, in effect, community  policing  could  also  be  used  'to penetrate the community through other professional agencies and by spying on  the  community,  under  the  guise  of  offering  a  protective,  friendly approach.  'Consent'  is  thus  to  be  'engineered'  and,  in  case  this  fails, intelligence is gathered in an attempt to pre-empt dissent.'

## The police and the community

Insensitivity in their relations with the black community has led to calls for a systematic programme of police education on ethnic minorities and for a departure from the wilful use of 'strong-arm' tactics which arouse hostility to  police  presence  as  at  Southall.  Indeed,  the  outside  intervention  of  the SPG has, so far, not inspired any feelings of mutual trust and co-operation between local groups and the police.

Although there has been much criticism of the specialist  police  units, McNee,  Anderton  and  Jardine  have  singled  out  such  units  for  praise. McNee in particular  made  his  feelings  for  the  SPG  abundantly  clear.  He told a black reporter, following references to the group in connection with Blair Peach's death (during the NF protest) 'If you keep off the streets of London and behave yourselves you won't have the SPG to worry about. I understand the concern of your people. But if you don't get into trouble you won't come into confrontation with the police.' 43 By contrast, the Institute of Race Relations stated:

The  SPG  …  has  been  increasingly  deployed  in  so-called  'highcrime' areas (Brixton, Peckham, Lewisham, Tooting, Stoke Newington, Kentish Town, Hackney and Notting Hill) which are in reality decaying  inner  city areas of substandard  housing,  low amenities  and  high  unemployment  where  the  white  working  class and the majority of black people live. Evidence of its operations in these areas clearly demonstrates that black people have been a prime

target of the SPG, especially in Lewisham and Lambeth. The tactics used by the SPG officers when 'doing over' a 'highcrime' area are aggressive (because of their training in riot-control) result in a high proportion of arrests for assault or obstruction as a consequence of this and, because of what appears to be an in-built prejudice, result in  a  high  number  of  arrests  of  black  people,  especially  young blacks. 44

Moreover,  the  Institute  argues  that  the  SPG's  essential  function  had changed from being a 'support anti-crime unit' to a 'police command unit', actively involved in 'indiscriminate stop-and-search activities'.

Lambeth, with a major concentration of black people, was given special attention from the SPG. 'Swamp 81' was the latest in a long line of 'attacks' in  the  area.  Between  1975  and  1979  there  were  six  such  'attacks'  by  the SPG, characterised by road blocks, early morning raids and random street checks. The SPG operation was concentrated around four housing estates, all with  large  black  populations.  The  police  felt  these  methods  were essential to general crime prevention and particularly effective in combating 'crime waves' such as 'muggings'.

Growing interest in 'sus' aroused wider discussion of police powers and practice as it relates to civil rights and criminal procedure. The controllers of  the  state  machinery,  however,  felt  that  tighter  control  of  law  and  order was  necessary.  For  example,  the  Home  Office,  the  Director  of  Public Prosecutions,  the  Magistrates  Association  and  police  organisations  were demanding changes in criminal procedure to make prosecution easier and to enlarge police powers.

## Blacks and the British police

Given  this  historical  development  of  police  strategy  and  their  proposed increased  powers  (the  Police  Bill)  what  was  the  relationship  between  the police  and  the  black  community?  The  Metropolitan  Police  campaign  to recruit  Blacks into the force, supported by an editorial in the West Indian World was yet another case of 'come and join us and we will help you'. In response, Race  Today ('The  voice  of  the  Black  Community  in  Britain') advocated  the  opposite:  'the  mass  organisation  of  unemployed  youth, students and parents to fight this particular issue. We will continue, as we have been doing, to commit all our resources in this direction.' 45

This  stand  was  hardly  surprising.  Armed  with  wide  powers  and  the security of full backing from the state, police harassment during the 1960s and  particularly  in  the  1970s  had  hit  a  new  low  in  1976.  Between November  1975  and  June  1976,  there  were  several  clashes  between  the police and black youths.

It was  clear  that  the  black  community,  under  attack  on  an  everincreasing scale, would not be bullied in their 'home ground'. They strongly resisted  the  actions  of  police  officers,  one  of  whom  reported  it  to  the Parliamentary Select Committee on Race Relations:

Recently there has been a growth in the tendency for members of London's  West  Indian  communities  to  combine  against  police  by interfering  with  police  officers  who  are  effecting  the  arrest  of  a black  person  or  who  are  in  some  other  way  enforcing  the  law  in situations which involve black people. In the last 12 months 40 such incidents have been recorded. Each carries a potential for large scale disorder. 46

Repeated clashes with the police, in many black communities, brought a heightened  awareness  of  this  repressive  force,  nationally.  Unemployed youth  and  students  were  the  usual  targets.  With  growing  unemployment among school-leavers  a  mass  of  young  wageless  persons  emerged  within the community. Financed by Urban Aid, youth projects were set up in the black  communities  where  black  youths  congregated  daily  to  'while  away the  hours'.  In  these  'haunts'  confrontation  with  police  officers  led  to resistance from these young Blacks. The view that as unemployed workers, they were supposed to be demoralised victims ready to move anywhere, cap in hand, imploring employers for jobs, was based on the traditional view of unemployed workers. Although their parents might have taken this line, in 1976, this  attitude  towards  work  was  dead  among  young  Blacks.  Clearly, they  were  not  prepared  to  be  isolated  or  demoralised.  Energetic  and resourceful they hoped that society would respond positively to meet their needs. Anything less would be resisted. Indeed, theirs was a movement of resistance, one which police officers instinctively attack. This was the basis for the on-going war between young Blacks and the police.

How did the police operate? Their general strategy to groups of young Blacks  has  been  to  'harass,  attack  and  disperse',  as  was  the  case  at

Chapeltown,  Leeds.  In  the  'war  against  the  unemployed',  individuals became  the  target.  Here  is  an  account  of  how  it  happens:  two  or  three youths  are  walking  down  the  street  or  standing  at  a  bus  stop.  The  police swoop  and  arrest  them.  The  charges  are  loitering  with  intent  to  steal  or attempting  to  steal  from  person  or  persons  unknown.  There  is,  in  most cases,  some  resistance  which  leads  to  an  additional  charge  of  assault  on police.

The  police  make  up  their  notes  in  the  canteen.  The  attempted  or intended theft is in all cases from a woman's handbag. Although the woman is described in detail, more often than not the police were unable to bring her to court. She always eludes them at that crucial moment. Nonetheless, a conviction is guaranteed in the magistrate's court. Hundreds of cases of this kind have been reported against black youths.

## Race, class and autonomy

According  to  Stuart  Hall,  in  contemporary  Britain,  'The  class  relations which  inscribe  the  black  fractions  of  the  working  class  function  as  race relations.  The  two  are  inseparable.  Race  is  the  modality  in  which  class relations are experienced.' 47

On the question of 'Race, Struggle and Class Formation' one writer has argued  that  confronting  a  class  struggle  in  and  through  'race',  the  move from 'race' to class becomes crucial at this point because 'The division of humanity  into  social  classes  explains  its  history  infinitely  better  than  its division into races or peoples.' However, he adds, 'it cannot be accomplished  without  reconceptualising  class  in  opposition  to  a  Marxist orthodoxy  which  views  the  working  class  as  a  continuous  historical subject.'

In opposition to theorists who reduce race to custom or ethnicity as part of their own parochial battle to maintain the sociology of ethnic relations it is necessary to locate racist and anti-racist ideology as well as the struggle for black  liberation in a perspective  on  culture  as  an  area  of  class conflicts. 48 Richard  Johnson's  contribution  to  the  theorisation  of  working class culture directs us that although working class culture cannot be seen as  having  a  simple  function  to  workers'  need,  capital  has  a  stake  in  the forms of working class culture. Given that the mass of black people who

arrived  in  Britain  recently,  the  casualties  of  colonial  underdevelopment, brought  with  them  legacies  of  their  political,  ideological  and  economic struggles in Africa, the Caribbean and the Indian sub-continent, instead of being inflexible, their accumulated histories of resistance have brought new dimensions to struggle at the cultural level.

## Sivanandan has argued that:

… it is cultural resistance which takes on new forms … in order to fully contest foreign domination. But culture in the periphery is not equally developed in all sections of society … it does have a mass character  …  at  the  economic  level  different  exploitations  in  the different  modes  confuse  the  formal  lines  of  class  struggle  but  the common  denominators  of  political  oppression  make  for  a  mass movement. Hence the resolutions in these countries are not necessarily  class,  socialist  resolutions  -  they  do  not  begin  as  such anyway. They are not even nationalist resolutions as we know them. They are mass movements with national and revolutionary components  -  sometimes  religious,  sometimes  secular,  often  both but always against the repressive state and its imperial backers. 49

Given  the  political  traditions  which  Blacks  have  brought  with  them, they and their British-born children have preserved organic links with their transplanted political consciousness, 'in their kitchens and temples - in their communities . Though  their new  struggles at the centre are diffused throughout a different structure … the lingering bile of slavery, indenture and colonialism remains in the forms of struggle, political philosophy, and revolutionary perspectives of non-European radical traditions.'

On  the  questions  of  such  localised  struggles  over  education,  racial violence  and  police  practices,  black  people  have  used  the  community  'to provide the axis along which to organise themselves'. Thus, in this context, 'the  concept of community is central to the view of class struggle' which 'links distinct cultural and political traditions with a territorial dimension, to collective  actions  and  consciousness  within  the  relation  of  'economic patterns, political authority and the uses of space'. 50

It has been argued that the history of working-class communities is an integral part of the processes of industrialisation and social discipline which established  the  city  as  a  site  of  unique  political  conflicts.  The  form  and

relevance of community have responded to the changing social character of capitalist  production  which  allocated  black  labour  to  a  specific  place, highlighting the means by which 'the dissociation of the upper and lower classes achieves form in the city itself.

Moreover,  Gareth Stedman-Jones  has  directed our attention to a growing separation of the workplace from the domestic scene as having a major bearing on the cultural and political patterns of urban workers in late nineteenth-century  London.  Gilroy  adds  crucially  that  this  description  of community 'illustrates how the concept can be useful in the connection of waged  and  domestic  labour  space.  It  is  valuable  not  only  where  leisure practices impinge on the labour process, but also where political organisation  forged  outside  the  immediate  processes  of  production  (for blacks, with juridico-political apparatuses, organised racists or profiteering ghetto landlords) has effects on the struggle at work, and vice versa'. 51

It is therefore vital to our understanding, that 'the political traditions of black  people,  expressed  in  the  solidarity  and  political  strength  of  their communities, have determined a specific territorialisation of social control'.

The  integration  of  Blacks  into  the  political  apparatuses  of  the  social democratic state requires consideration of the ideology of self-help which fused  political  representation  and  state  intervention,  disorganising  black discontent and channelling it into 'quasi-colonial institutional structures … [which  would]  deal  with  the  issue  of  race  outside  traditional  political arenas'. 52 Thus, it was argued:

If  the  political  consensus  over  containing  the  black  problem  owed something  to  the  colonial  period  the  black  organisations  which struggled with it on the terrain of community made this connection increasingly explicit … In a nationalist framework which could do little more than present an inverted image of the oppressor's power, the issue of black control of self-help projects sometimes obscured the nature of the schemes themselves. By restricting their analysis to racial parameters, the nationalist self-help groups become easy prey for  state  institutions  already  placing  a  premium  on  self  help  'as  a response to the threat posed by alienated black youth'. The Community Relations Commission's self-help report of 1976 spells out  the  limits  of  their  approach:  'Some  of  the  leaders  of  self-help

groups  have  strong  political  views  particularly  with  regard  to  the struggles  for  freedom  for  blacks  in  the  USA  and Africa. These  do not  however  appear  to  have  any  significant  effect  on  the  work  of these organisations'. 53

Indeed  the  generational  conflict  in  the  black  communities  reflects conflicts both of organisation and ideology. This is clearly expressed in the debates concerning political responses between the Asian Youth Movements and the IWAs, illustrating 'a distinction between composite and autonomous modes of class struggle in complex fashion, overdetermined by the peasant political traditions from which both have sprouted'. 54

In Britain, black  people  are  involved  in  political  and  ideological struggles through their collective experience of racism and refusal of racial domination.  Hence  the  politics  of  black  liberation  is  necessarily  cultural politics in that Coons,  Pakis,  nig-nogs,  sambos  and  wogs  are  social constructions in culture . Indeed central to the cultural politics of Blacks in Britain is the 'profound negation of Race'. It has been argued that 'the key to understanding the relatively recent supercession of nationalist politics by an international revolutionary movement of black people, the most visible manifestations  of  which  are  organised  popular  currents  in  the  Caribbean, America and Britain which have been identified by the dominant ideology as 'Ethiopianism' or 'Rastafarianism' … is no recent development.' 55

Historically, 'Rastafarian culture remains an indelible link between the resistance of the maroons, the Pan Africanist appeal of Marcus Garvey, the materialist  and  historical  analysis  of  Walter  Rodney  and  the  defiance  of reggae.' 56

The influence of Afro-Caribbean culture in general, and through reggae, Rastafarianism in particular, on the lives and politics of white working-class youth is much overlooked.

Given the central importance of the cultural offensive of reggae music to the political development of the mass movement, Rasta women engaged in  their  own  distinctive  feminist  struggle.  On  this  struggle  and  the  Rastas cultural development, it has been argued that Judy Mowatt:

had  made  'the  queen'  the  starting  point  for  a  redefinition  of  the Rasta women, establishing her in an activist role waging struggles

distinct  from  but  complementary  to  those  of  her  brethren  …  Her songs Strength To Go Through, Slave Queen and Black Woman were the  basis  of  the  record's  great  popularity  at  grassroots  level,  but  it was in Sisters Chant that Mowatt made her straightforward demand for the validity of 'feminist' Rastafari in language which recalled the nineteenth-century feminists who distinguished between 'man' and 'god'  …  The  breadth  of  the  Rastas'  cultural  intervention  is  also important. Like the 'Bop' players of the 1960s who absorbed black nationalism  and  Elijah  Mohammed  alike,  reggae  musicians  have been  converted  to  Rasta  in  such  numbers  that  it  has  become impossible to discuss one without the other. Though there are certain styles which appeal more to older people, the universal popularity of Bob Marley is a good illustration of how these different preferences have been spanned … The popularity of communalist ideology and its  implicit  politics  may  also  be  gauged  by  the  widespread  use  of Rasta  concepts  and  speech  patterns  by  those  who  do  not  wish  to express their affiliation or interests more overtly. Such language is able  to  convey  commitment  in  a  selective  or  intermittent  manner, and its  racially  exclusive  mode  invites  speakers  to  appropriate  the ideas  which  appeal  to  them  without  being  pigeon-holed  by  the oppressor. 57

Significantly,  the  most  theological  amongst  Rastas  see  the  primary struggle for black liberation here and now. Indeed, religion has consistently formed a basis of struggle for the colonised and enslaved, reinforcing their resistance  to  servitude  rather  than  waiting  for  deliverance  in  a  state  of passive  obedience.  To  this  extent  it  must  be  understood  that  'the  radical potential of religious ideology is not the sole property of African and Asian traditions'. 58

Thus, those who tend to see 'religion' as detracting from the development  of  political  consciousness  have  yet  to  explain  the  Rastas' 'disinterest in the New Testament gospels, or their predilection for Psalms, Revelation, and the history of the children of Israel'.

In the politics of the Rasta, the effect of music is pervasive. Essentially, in Britain it has been argued that in the realm of 'leisure no less than that of work has hosted the extraordinary encounter between the political traditions of disorganic development in the periphery and the urban working class at

the centre. Youth culture has also created an important space for dialogue between black youth from the different communities. Asian youth movements have been inspired by the combativity of Afro-Caribbean young people  which  has  received  spectacular  press  coverage  while  their  own equally tenacious deference of their communities remains concealed behind a stereotype of passivity.'

Thus the change in post-war British politics -particularly the introduction  of  the  welfare  state  and  changes  in  production  -  informed consequent  changes  in  political organisation and  struggle. Given  the 'ultimate  direction'  of  the  popular  struggle  of  white  youth,  it  has  been argued that:

its form  has been  prefigured in the resistances of the black communities,  in  much  the  same  way  that  the  movement  of  black Americans  in  the  1960s  determined  the  patterns  of  autonomous protest which followed it … The mechanisms of white youth culture provided  the  means  to  popularise  oppositional  ideas  forged  in  the powerlessness of youth. Since the incorporation of reggae into the subcultural repertoire in the late 1960s, political themes have begun to  displace  moral  and  generational  conflict  as  the  raw  material  of young peoples' cultural expression.

In spite of the short-lived alliance between punk and reggae muscians, reggae continued to have a steady appeal to white youths. The emergence of local radio with minority appeal music programming during 1970-2 made the  music  available  to  white  youths.  Of  course  with  this  widening  appeal and potential market, entrepreneurial business was not slow to act. Indeed, 'the  link  between  the  multinational  entertainment  corporation  and  the purveyors of reggae to the ghettoes of Britain was secured by a Jamaican exile  who owned the company Island Records … an appendage of EMI.' Through Jimmy Cliff, Island took black music to the white pop fan. The release of the film The Harder They Come in 1972 marked the 'beginning of the mass movement of black British Youth towards Rastafari'.

According to Cashmore, the expression of discontent in reggae, 'acted to slough off any latent militancy in the black working class by translating the hostility into musical form rather than converting it into programmatic proposals'. 59

Barry Troyna believes that the social and political orientations of young Blacks may be read off from their musical preferences. 60  He explains that 'The  Rastafarian-inspired  lyrics  inform  and  help  structure  their  particular perspectives and provide them with their own distinctive and impenetrable group argot.'

It was also argued that:

While  reggae  music  may  be  subdivided  into  'lovers'  and  'roots' styles  which  echo  Troyna's  categories,  this  distinction does  not apply at the level of lyrics . The contrast relates to the different dance styles and the overlapping social relations in which they appear … the dominant form of reggae.

Dub is not a style of music as such. It is 'a process of enrichment in  which  music  is  deconstructed  and  the  meaning  of  its  lyrics transformed  and  expanded  …  Though  they  may  introduce  an analytic coherence, political lyrics must be regarded as secondary to the issues implicit in the form  of  reggae  and  its consequent exploration  in  Dub  …  Dubbing  is  a  feature  of  overtly  committed and apparently unpolitical recordings alike. Dub is a bridge between them rooted in their form 61

Thus,  reggae  music  is  instructive  and  should  remind  the  Eurocentric sociologist  that,  'Acquiring  and  developing  class  consciousness  does  not mean obligatory boredom. It is a question of transforming what used to be used exclusively for pleasure and leisure into a means of instruction.' 62

Given that reggae music is much  more  than the 'lullaby of a beleaguered population' Gilroy argues 'the Dub movement avoids a trap set for  all  singers  of  political  songs  forced  to  contend  with  their  art  being packaged and sold as commodities.' 63  On the question of automonous class struggle, Rastafari is regarded as an expression of the critical consciousness which informs those black struggles (which are 'not merely political in the broadest sense but approach the task of social transformation) … commenting on society and state, and extending into an analysis of the postcolonial scene as a whole'.

In 'Steppin' Out of Babylcm', Gilroy argues further:

Though  for  the  social  analyst  'race'  and  class  are  necessarily abstractions at different levels, black consciousness of race and class cannot  be  empirically  separated.  The  class character of black struggles  is  not  a  result  of  the  fact  that  blacks  are  predominantly proletarian, though this is true. It is established in the fact that their struggles  for  civil  rights,  freedom  from  state  harassment,  or  as waged workers, are instances of the process by which the working class is constituted  politically, organised  in  politics.'  We  have distanced ourselves from the view of classes as continuous subjects of  history,  they  are  made  and  remade  in  a  continual  struggle.  We must also reject the ancient heresy of economistic Marxism which stipulates that the relations of community production alone determine  class  relations.  The  Marxist  concept  of  class  refers primarily but not exclusively to the location of groups in production relations  …  The  political  organisation  of  surplus  population  is particularly  salient  to  class  segmentation,  and  therefore  to  racial politics in the era of structural unemployment. It serves to remind us that the privileged place of economic classes in the Marxist theory of  history  is  not  to  be  equated  with  an  a  priori  assertion  of  their primacy in every historical moment. 64

As Prezworski wrote: 'Classes must be viewed as the effects of struggles structured by  objective conditions, that are simultaneously  economic, political  and  ideological.' 65 However, given the change in these objective conditions and the fact that the unity between the 'economic movement and political action' of the working class was different in 1981 from what it had been in 1971, it was argued that:

The  indeterminacy  introduced  by  a  view  of  class  formation  is  an effect  of  heterogeneous  struggles  perhaps  premised  on  different communalities - linguistic, sexual, regional, ecological and 'racial' - is a useful tool against reductionism. It is also a place at which a historical and non-essentialist theory of human needs can be worked into the practice of class politics. 66

According  to  Alan  Touraine,  'The  politics  of  need  is  to  the  fore  in movements  for  black  liberation,  as  in  many  of  the  other  autonomous

political  forces  in  the  ascendant  during  the  last  15  years.' 67 Thus,  on  the question of class formation, it was argued that,

in our view of class formation, the racist ideologies and practices of the  white  working  class  and  the  consequent  differentiation  of  'the Blacks' are ways in which the class as a whole is disorganised. The struggles of black people to refuse and transform their subjugation are no simple antidote to class segmentation, but they are processes which  attempt to constitute the class politically across racial divisions  -  'that  is  which  represent  it  against  capitalism  against racism. 68

Furthermore, it appears that 'autonomous organisation has enabled Blacks and women to 'leap frog' over their fellow workers into direct confrontations  with  the  state  in  the  interest  of  the  class  as  a  whole.'  The struggle for abortion rights, and campaigns by black organisations against state harassment are examples of this.

Indeed,  both  movements  have  long  struggled  to  transform  society. Concluding his exploration of 'Race, Class and Autonomy' Gilroy wrote:

black  political  traditions  fall  outside  the  'contradictory  unity'  of corporatism/parliamentarism. There is also overwhelming evidence to support the view that the institutions of the white working class have failed to represent the interests of black workers abroad and at home, where black rank-and-file organisation has challenged local and  national union  bureaucracy  …  these  institutions  (do not) represent  the  class as  a  class at  all.  Nor  are  Blacks  alone  in  the marginalisation  they  suffer.  The  experiences  of  female,  young, unemployed  or  even  unskilled  workers  present  parallel  examples, while  the  growth  of  rank-and-file  organisation,  and  of  conflict between shop stewards and their higher echelons of union bureaucracy only hint at the complexity of workplace struggle. The failures of these institutions must be compared to the rapid growth of  new movements with an autonomy from capitalist command as well  as  from  the  constricting  political  repertoire  of  the  'labour movement'. 69

## Black consciousness: spontaneous crowd violence

Violence against black people in the British colonies had its counterpart in Britain. The ideology of racism, rooted in capitalism, having spread through the  exploitation  of  black  people  inherent  in  colonialism  and  imperialism, had become a part of black repression in the modern metropole.

The settlement  of  Blacks  in  the  dockland  areas  of  Britain,  in  spite  of their  impoverishment  in  these  'decaying'  areas,  had  been  a  convenient target for the 'ills' of the government, the employers and the white working class.  Like  earlier  disadvantaged  powerless  groups  in  society,  they  were conscious of their oppression and responded appropriately through collective action.

Collective violence, however, is not seen as a mere 'side effect' of social strains,  but  as  a  consequence  of  the  impact  of  structural  changes  on  the arrangements of groups in contention for power. Such violence, seemingly disorganised and meaningless, underscores a group and class cohesion, and the mobilisation of violence to 'complement and extend organised, peaceful attempts … to accomplish … objectives'. 70

Given these arguments, the findings of the National Advisory Commission  on  Civil  Disorders  (The  Kerner  Commission)  is  relevant. Using  the  disorganisation  approach  to  the  1967  ghetto  uprisings  in  the United  States,  the  Commission  viewed  typical  riot  participants  as  '… criminal  types,  over-active  social  deviants,  or  riff-raff  -  recent  migrant members of an uneducated underclass - alienated from responsible negroes and without broad social or political concerns'. It was found, however, that the 'typical rioter' was male, between 15 and 24 years of age, resident of the city (not a newly arrived migrant) who was (most interestingly) likely to be  of  the  same  economic  status  as  his  neighbour  who  did  not  riot,  but 'better  educated,  informed  about  politics,  and  more  likely  to  have  been  a 'political activist''. 71 Moreover, the report also based on the 1967 riots, in the context of black involvement and support for the riots found:

First  that  a  substantial  minority  of  the  Negro  population,  ranging from  roughly  10  to  20  per  cent,  actively  participated  in  the  riots. Second, that the rioters, far from being primarily of the riff-raff and outside agitators, were fairly representative of the ghetto communities. And third, that a sizeable minority (or, in some cases a

majority)  of  the  negroes  who  did  not  riot  sympathised  with  the rioters. 72

In Britain, strong support for these findings are to be found in the works of E.  J.  Hobsbawm,  George  Rude  and  E.  P.  Thompson  referring  to  violent crowds in eighteenth-century England and France. They approached collective violence as political struggle and the protest of ordinary people for  a  common  cause.  In  the  eighteenth  century  disturbances,  in  Paris  and London, Rude found a 'representative cross-section' of the working classes involved  in  well-planned  and  'ritualised'  protest  informed  by  coherent,  if not fully developed ideologies. Commenting on these disturbances and the crowd's importance in history between 1730 and 1848, he argued that:

in  general,  it  is  perhaps  not  unreasonable  to  see  these  earlier, immature,  and  often  crude,  trials  of  strength  …  as  forerunners  of later movements  whose  results  and  successes  have  been  both significant and enduring. 73

In  support,  Hobsbawm  saw  such  'Primitive  Rebels'  as  participants  in 'collective bargaining by riot'; riots which affected the political process and were significantly maintained. He argued:

The  classical  mob  did  not  merely  riot  as  protest,  but  because  it expected  to  achieve  somehing  by  its  riots.  It  assumed  that  the authorities would be sensitive to its movements, and probably also that  they  would  make some sort of immediate concession. For the mob was not simply a casual collection of people united for some ad hoc  purpose,  but  in  a  recognised  sense  a  permanent  entity  even though rarely permanently organised as such. 74

Commenting  on  the  ideas  and  beliefs  behind  crowd  action,  E.  P. Thompson refers to a 'moral economy'. He wrote:

It  is  possible  to  detect  in  almost  every  eighteenth  century  crowd action  some  legitimising  action.  By  the  notion  of  legitimation  I mean that the men and women in the crowd were informed by the belief that they were defending traditional rights and customs; and

in  general that they were supported by the wider concensus of the community. 75

This  focus  on  collective  violence  as  political  protest,  opposition  or dissent  to  some  extent  has  been  directly  related  to  instances  of  collective racial violence where black communities confront the repressive forces of the state. Martin Luther King described riots as 'the voice of the unheard'. 76 Indeed,  according  to  Rude,  the  black  uprisings  in  America  in  the  1960s were seen as having a 'distinct flavour' of the 'pre-industrial riot' during the eighteenth  and  nineteenth  centuries  in  Europe. 77 Moreover,  given  the various social groupings 'jockeying' for power, this approach to collective violence is also relevant to instances of inter-racial communal violence.

Given this orientation, historically, collective racial violence in twentieth-century Britain covers two major phases: the period from 1900 to 1948, a time when inter-racial violence took largely communal form and the period  from  1948  to  the  'Bristol  Riot'  and  later,  when  violence  was  the outcome  of  confrontation  between  the  police  and  black  communities.  Of course, there is no clear demarcation line between the two periods.

The first period can be seen as one in which collective racial violence is but  a  part  of  wider  changing  conflicts  and  contradictions  between  social groups  and  interests.  Indeed,  it  has  been  argued  that  'The  conflicts  and contradictions  which  are  racial,  within  class  and  between  classes,  all incorporate  a  power  and  political  dimension;  but  in  the  formal  sense  this dimension is also evident in the role of the state'; and in the second phase, race  is  shifted  to  the  centre  of  the  political  stage,  achieving  a  'greater complexity  and  significance'  within  the  state.  Significantly,  it  is  in  the location of the state's disposition on race, in the post-war social changes in Britain,  that  one  must  seek  an  explanation  of  declining  collective  white racial violence. 78

## The historical background

Between  1900  and  1948  white  violence  was  met  with  black  resistance. From the 1880s until the Second World War, and after, white seamen were opposed to the use of colonial labour. The pattern of British race relations during  this  period  was  reflected  in  the  labour  relations  in  the  shipping industry.

A growing number of black seamen had settled in Cardiff. This black population  was  a  matter  of  great  concern  to  people  of  local  eminence. Commenting  on  life  'In  Nigger  Town',  George  R.  Sims,  the  socialist reformer wrote in 1907:

The conditions which prevail in this unpleasant quarter are responsible for a grave scandal. It is a scandal which would not be tolerated  for  one  moment  in  say  America.  …  The  district  has  of course,  a  number  of  respectable  inhabitants,  honest  and  decent people, black and white, who toil and trade and are superior to their environment.  But  it  has  certain  features  which  make  it  one  of  the most repellent places in which a Briton, blest with pride of race, can spend a morning, afternoon or an evening. 79

Given this background, the Chinese community in Cardiff was attacked on 20 April 1911. The trouble arose when a national strike was called by the National Seamen  and  Firemen's  Union  to  win  higher wages.  Weak unionisation, endemic in this industry, was the real problem in the way of the  seamen  realising  their  demands,  not  the  numerically  small  group  of Chinese  seamen  whose  permanent  domicile  in  Cardiff  presented  no  real threat  to  the  strike.  Nevertheless,  when  the  shipowners  threatened  to  use Chinese  labour  to  break  the  strike,  the  whole  Chinese  community  came under attack.

This attack must be seen as a continuing process of animosity against the  Chinese,  engendered  by  the  Seamen's  Union  and  the  middle-class Christian  pressure  groups  concerned  with  'moral  order'  in  Cardiff.  In  its propaganda, the union resorted to racism against the 'yellowman' and his community.

Particular hostility was directed against the dreaded mixing of the races -  the  association  of  Chinese  men  with  white  women,  either  as  wives  or employees. 80 In fact, when the employers did use Chinese labour to break the  strike,  the  strikers  and  their  supporters  were  enraged.  Thereafter,  the Chinese community was faced with the full blast of the white community, including the Trades and Labour Council whose earlier reluctance gave way to condemnation of the shipowners for using Chinese blacklegs, and called upon the Cardiff working class to boycott the Chinese laundries. 81

Race relations had not improved by 1919. Black-bashing in the United States  struck  familiar  responses  in  Britain.  From  the  'yellow'  (and  the earlier  anti-Jewish  riots  in  Cardiff)  the  focus  shifted  to  black  seamen,  the rock-bottom of the social scale. Between April and August 1919 the black population in most of Britain's major seaports experienced racial violence. Unlike the 1911 'riots' which arose out of a trade dispute and were directed at  one  group  of  colonial  workers,  these  instances  of  violence  were  'race riots' involving white crowds attacking local black communities.

The street violence had started in Liverpool on the night of 4 June when a  fight  between  a  group  of  Blacks  and  Norwegian  seamen  dramatically turned into a 'siege' of black boarding houses.

The violence, which continued for more  than a week, revealed something of the relationship between the police and the black community. Significantly,  the  police,  unable  to  protect  the  black  community  from  the marauding  white  crowds,  did  an  interesting  thing:  they  took  whole  black families  into  'protective  custody'.  Seven  days  after  the  riots  began,  the police held over 700 black people. 82

From  Liverpool  the  violence  spread  simultaneously  to  Newport,  and then to Cardiff. But although the violence had petered out, the Cardiff area continued  to  be  heavily  policed.  One  wonders  whether  the  police  were protecting  or  provoking  the  black  community  at  a  time  when  'Negro Hunting'  as  the  South  Wales Daily  News put  it,  'had  developed  into something like a fever'.

Why  were  the  Whites  so  resentful  of  Blacks?  The  dominant  theme explaining  this  resentment  (a  major  media  preoccupation)  was  relations between  black  men  and  white  women.  Indeed,  sexual  relations  between them aroused deep racial tension. Given that the black man's 'chief failing' was his 'fondness for white women', the solution to the immorality inherent in  the  racial  situation  in  British  ports,  was  to  'Deport  or  Colonise'.  The Liverpool  Courier suggested  racial  segregation. 83 It  would  seem  that  the press were dissatisfied with their objective of enlightening public opinion by turning it against black seamen. They argued that if the public had been 'more  vigilant'  (could  it  have  reacted  more  violently?),  as  in  the  United States, there would have been no 'evil'! 84

There  were  violent  clashes  during  the  inter-war  years  and  in  1948  in Liverpool.  During  these  years,  black  seamen  and  the  emergent  black

'second-generation' underwent severe economic and social hardship. They became a subject for social investigation. The most significant violent racial clashes during the inter-war years were in Cardiff in 1923 and 1929 and in South  Shields  in  1930. 85 These  incidents  arose  from  industrial  disputes. Later in 1948, racial violence erupted in Liverpool for three nights during the August  Bank  Holiday.  Even  more  than  in  1919,  the  behaviour  of  the police was a major issue in these clashes. One observer reported:

the police appear to have retaliated with a singular lack of discrimination  with  the  result  that  a  number  of  men  who  had  not been involved in the affair received unwarranted injuries and were arrested … The general impression appears to be that the police took action which they thought could bring the disturbances to a close as quickly  as  possible  -  which,  in  their  view  meant  removing  the coloured  community,  rather  than  attempting  to  arrest  the  body  of irresponsible whites who were involved. 86

In effect, the police strategy during these violent clashes, and their use of excessive  violence  in  indiscriminate  arrests  of  Blacks,  engendered solidarity within a beleaguered black community. Positive organisation led to the setting up of a defence fund to help towards the legal expenses of 60 Blacks  (as  opposed  to  only  10  Whites)  arrested.  Once  again,  through selective arrests, the police was propagandising against the black community.

In the inter-racial violence, the state had its role to play. By the time of the 1919 disturbances, it was apparent that the state was ready to confirm and  legitimise  racial  practices  within  the  shipping  industry,  which  was powerfully  influential  in  the  'City'  and  well  represented  in  Parliament. 87 Indeed, the convenient increase in colonial labour during the first settlement, already in the air in 1911, was greater in 1919 with the growth of popular  nationalism  during  the  war.  Interestingly,  this nationalism excluded Blacks from post-war benefits, although thousands of black men had risked their lives in the cause of the war.

To add insult to injury, repatriation became a major issue soon after the 1919 riots. The South Wales press pulled out all the stops on this issue: 'The government  ought  to  declare  it  to  be  part  of  National  Policy  that  this country  is  not  to  be  regarded  as  an  immigration  field,  that  no  more

immigrants can be admitted, and that immigrants must be returned whence they came. This must apply to black men from the British West Indies as well  as  from  the  United  States.' 88 The  trade  unions  and  ex-soldiers  also gave their support to this policy.

What  emerged  after  the  1919  violence  was  the  fact  that  the  black population was the primary responsibility of the government. In fact, both the Cardiff and Liverpool local authorities approached the Home Office, the Colonial  Office,  the  Ministry  of  Shipping  and  the  Ministry  of  Labour  to repatriate the Blacks. 89 The persuasion tactic, left in the hands of the police both  in  Cardiff  and  Liverpool,  in  spite  of  some  success  in  registering Blacks, was strongly resisted. In Liverpool of the 200 black seamen and exsoldiers who had registered, only 43 were actually repatriated. 90 In Cardiff, only 30 black seamen accepted.

These departures of Blacks from Britain had the effect of increasing the importance  of  immigration  control  and  repatriation  in  state  manoeuvres. Legislation  was  necessary.  Thus,  the  1925  Special  Restriction  (Coloured Alien Seamen) Order drawn up by the Conservative government of 1924, came into being.  Blacks  found  themselves  trying  to  prove  that  they  were British  colonial  subjects.  In  the  witch-hunt  the  black  community  was harassed  by  the  police,  local  alien  departments  and  immigration  officers. Representatives of the black seamen called on the assistance of the League of  Coloured Peoples who found that the registration process was a police 'campaign'.

The LCP investigation and report showed that where 'persuasion' failed, the  threats  of  arrest  and  imprisonment  were  used.  It  was  not  until  1932, largely  through  the  political  agitation  of  the  black  community  that  the Home Office formulated a procedure through which registration under the 1925 Order could be reversed. When, however, the procedure was applied in 1935, in relation to a provision made under the Shipping Assistance Act 1935, virtually debarring aliens from employment in British ships eligible for government aid within the terms of the Act, hundreds of 'coloured alien seamen' were thrown out of work. 91

During the inter-war years, the 1925 Order had an all-pervasive effect on  the  black  community,  dominating  their  lives  and  political  struggles. When finally,  it  was  repealed,  just  before  the  Second  World  War,  Britain

again called on the services not only of black seamen, but of hundreds of thousands of other black colonials.

## Black revolt

Race,  class  and  power  relations  determined  the  form  of  collective  racial violence  during  the  1911,  1919,  and  1948  riots  which  were  initiated  by white crowds. Black seamen posed both an economic and political threat to white  organised  labour.  The  discriminatory  wage  levels  applied  to  black seamen  pointed  up  the  contradiction  within  organised  labour.  In  fact, organised  labour  had  collaborated  with  capital  to  effect  racial  strictures within  the  shipping  industry.  Thus,  in  defending  its  sectional  interest, organised white labour used its collective bargaining power to restrict the employment of black labour.

The economic threat was followed by the political. Because most black workers in the industry were outside the union, in ensuring the structured power  relations  between  capital  and  organised  labour,  it  weakened  the union's  bargaining  power  to  win  wage  increases  and  better  working conditions, thus giving the advantage to capital to effectively resist labour's demands.

Another  area  of  concern  to  the  white  crowds  was  competition  with black  workers  for  housing  and  residential  space.  This  segregation  and isolation  in  Cardiff  of  the  black  working  class  (a  result  of  local  official politics) also reflected a racial and imperialist ideology, strongly advocated by the middle class moralists, the local media, religious associations, police officials and other local administrators.

Although  they  were  clearly  disadvantaged,  Blacks  were  not  willing victims.  In  1919  there  was  determined  black  resistance  in  defence  of  the black  community  in  Cardiff.  Unemployment  among  Blacks  in  British seaports  after  the  war  was  compounded  when  the  Shipping  Federation decided to give preference to white seamen in British ports. Given that there were no real prospects of alternative employment, their war efforts showed up a deep sense of injustice, which white racial attack did little to assuage.

Moreover, the police were active in the suppression of black cafes and in enforcing the 1925 Special Restriction (Coloured Alien Seamen's) Order. For the black community which had survived the violent confrontations of 1919 and 1948, the message was clear: harassed black crowds had sound

reasons  for  resisting  police  aggression  in  their  communities.  Indeed  the police  were  increasingly  being  perceived  as  one  form  of  institutionalised racism. Consequently, during this period the black community, in need of support for its resistance, relied essentially on black organisations such as the  Cardiff-based  Coloured  Seamen's  Union,  the  League  for  Colonial Freedom and the London-based League of Coloured Peoples -organisations  which  played  the  leading  role  in  Cardiff's  black  political struggle during the inter-war years.

Between  1948  and  1980,  the  patterns  of  racial  violence  showed  a number of trends. There was firstly, a decline in collective white violence. Nottingham and Notting Hill in 1958 and Dudley in 1962 were the most noteworthy  instances,  though  small  in  scale  in  comparison  to  1919  and 1948. Secondly, there was the growth of individualised white racist attacks from the late 1960s. Thirdly, from the mid-1970s, there was the growth of 'race  related'  collective  political  violence.  As  in  Lewisham  in  1976  and Southall in 1979, there was public protest by the anti-racist movement, and violence which occurred between the crowd and the police. Finally, dating from the early 1970s there was an increasing incidence of violent collective conflict  between  Blacks  and  the  police.  Such  confrontations  were  of  two kinds: clashes occasioned by black political demonstrations and other kinds of  black  street  assembly;  for  example,  the  Mangrove  demonstration  in 1971,  the  carnivals  in  Chapeltown,  Leeds  in  1975  and  in  Notting  Hill  in 1976  and  clashes  resulting  from  specific  police  actions  within  the  black community,  such  as  the  Metro Youth  Club  incident  in  1971,  or  the  Four Aces  Club,  Dalston  in  1975  and  the  collective  violence  that  occurred  in Bristol in 1980, and elsewhere in 1981.

The  increasing  incidence  of  violent  conflict  between  Blacks  and  the police  is perhaps  the  most  significant  development  in  the  pattern  of collective  racial  violence  in  post-war  Britain,  culminating  in  the  'Bristol Riot'.

These conflicts and contradictions between Blacks and the state are of course  central  in  the  structuring  of  race  in  the  post-war  period.  The fundamental questions to be asked at this stage are: why and how this came to  be  so?  And  how  does  inter-communal  collective  violence  come  to  be replaced by the mobilisation of black violence against the state?

In responding to these questions, it has been argued that race in the postwar  era  had  been  situated  'within  two  related  processes:  the  distinctive

subordination  of  black  workers  in  the  new  phase  of  immigration  and  the nature of the state's involvement in that subordinating process, with special reference to the politicisation of race within the state'. 92

## From black resistance to black revolt

During the early period of post-war reconstruction, racialism in employment,  housing  and  schooling  was  a  fact  of  life  for  the  black community. At first, both Afro-Caribbeans and Asians found it difficult to cope with British prejudices. In alien territory, they were forced back into their own  communities.  While  the  West  Indians  organised  their  own churches, clubs and welfare organisations and congregated in barber shops, cafes or street corners, if the weather was fine, Indians and Pakistanis took naturally to their temples, mosques and cultural associations.

At the workplace, resistance to racialism often comprised individualistic and unco-ordinated responses. Given that Asians were generally employed in textile mills, foundries  and  factories,  while  Afro-Carribbeans  were concentrated in the service sector, the racial division of labour (the practice of the divide and rule strategy in the colonies, now a fact of life in post-war Britain)  kept  the  Asian,  Afro-Caribbean,  Asian-Caribbean  workers  apart. Moreover,  the  'ethnic  jobs'  and  'ethnic  shifts'  distinctions  detracted  from providing common ground for a common struggle of the black community as  a  whole.  Further,  during  these  early  years  of  immigration,  the  black population  was  small,  with  fewer Asians  and  more  West  Indians. At  this time,  resistance  to  racial  discrimination  at  work  was  largely  spontaneous. There  were,  however,  more  'organised',  collective  efforts  in  the  form  of petitions  calling  for  improvements  in  working  conditions,  facilities  and more pay. Generally white workers showed no interest in these collective actions. Undeterred, black workers persisted in forming associations on the shopfloor,  as  was  the  case  in  1951  in  a  Merseyside  factory.  In  their resistance  to  racial  abuse  and  discrimination  several  organisations  were formed.

Gradually  the  post-war  black  community  through  traditional  cultural and  welfare  associations  engendered  black  self-reliance  and  independent organisation. They recognised the immediate realities confronting them in Britain as having their roots in the past. Some - particularly the organisers were aware of the connections between colonialism and racialism, and were reminded  of  an  earlier  black  radical  tradition  in  Britain  by  such  writers,

activists and organisers as George Padmore, C. L. R. James, Ras Makonnen, I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson and Jomo Kenyatta. This radical group had helped to bring to fruition the struggles of earlier Pan Africanists who had resided during their periods of agitations in Britain, on and off, since Equiano and Cugoano. Black nationalism for Africa and the colonies, then, sustained black organisations in Britain.

Indian  Independence  in  1947  and  Kwame  Nkrumah's  leadership  of Ghana  to  Independence  in  1957,  followed  by  independence  for  other colonies in Africa, Asia and in the West Indies, strengthened the resolve of black British associations to resist racialism. Thus the anti-racial and anticolonial  struggle  of  the  early  post-war  immigrants  had  begun  to  reflect strong community bases.

Colonial freedom and black settlement was followed by state action to institutionalise racial discrimination, thus encouraging fascism. In the face of  the  gathering  forces,  black  struggle  and  black  unity  were  engaged  in  a continuous  process  of  meeting  the  challenge. Already  by  the  mid-1950s, black  immigration,  though  small  in  scale,  had  aroused  strong  feelings. Racialism  had  once  again  entered  the  political  arena  when  moves  were being made to bring about immigration control.

As Britain released her 'burdensome' colonies, the imperialist ideology of  racial superiority  was  adopted  by  extreme  right-wing  groups  with Hitlerian fervour. So much so, that one was left to wonder to what purpose was the war fought against Germany and her allies. Indeed, it was a time when  fascism  achieved  a  real  sense  of  respectability  by  taking  part  in electoral  politics.  Racial  superiority  was  preached  by  various  groups. The race-hate  they  stirred  led  to  racial  attacks  on  black  people.  Thus  'niggerhunting' and 'paki-bashing' became an aspect of the everyday experience of the  black  working  class  in  Britain.  In  the  repeated  instances  of  collective crowd violence the victims were portrayed as the aggressors and the 'cause' of the riots. Thus, they were the 'problem'.

As  in  the  case  of  India,  attempts  to  get  West  Indian  governments  to restrict  immigration  to  the  United  Kingdom  failed.  Nonetheless,  the  1962 Commonwealth Immigration Act was passed.

In the face of this act of institutionalised racism, the black community, which  had  increased  dramatically  by  those  trying  to  'beat  the  ban',  were even more conscious of their status as second-class citizens. Before 1958, a few black activists  who  saw  the  growing  wall  of  racial  prejudice  worked

towards  bringing  both  the  West  Indian  and  growing  Asian  communities together  to  resist  their  common  oppression.  A  campaigning  paper  was vitally necessary in linking the struggles of the various sections of the black community.  Thus,  in  1958  Claudia  Jones,  a  Trinidadian  Communist  and Amy Garvey (widow of Marcus Garvey) launched the first issue of an AfroCaribbean journal in Britain, The West Indian Gazette . And as if to convince the  sceptics  who  believed  that  Blacks  did  not  read,  other  publications followed  such  as Link,  Carib,  Anglo-Caribbean  News,  Tropic,  Flamingo, Daylight International, West Indies Observer and Magnet . 93 Black consciousness, having reached a high point after the riots and Cochrane's death,  moved Claudia Jones and Frances Ezzrecco to found the Coloured Peoples  Progressive  Association  which,  with  the  support  of  other  West Indian  organisations,  sent representatives to see the Home  Secretary. Several other events helped to maintain the level of black resistance.

Concern in the former colonies was reflected in representations made in Britain  by  leading  politicians.  Norman  Manley,  the  Prime  Minister  of Jamaica and Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, both advised their respective  communities  in  Britain.  This  international  support  helped  to place  clearly  the  ideology  of  racism  in  its  historical  and  international context.  The  struggles  on  the  periphery  were  directly  related  to the metropole.

After the 1962 Immigration Act, a number of issues directly relating to the black community left a lasting impression. Through its nationalisation, racialism  had  become  necessarily  a  part  of  the  state  machinery.  Other British institutions such as the Employers' Association and the trade unions, essentially capitalist organisations, were expected to, and began to conform to  the  standards  set  by  the  state.  Not  surprisingly,  racial  discrimination became  even  more  widespread  during  the  1960s  and  1970s,  than  in  the 1950s. As agents of the state, 'the police felt liberated too'.

The  'bussing'  of  black  schoolchildren,  'nigger-hunting'  and  'pakibashing'  became  the  butt  of  popular  jokes.  Racial  discrimination  was rampant. The hard experience of the black communities had informed them to close ranks, to build a stronger community  base.  At  home,  and particularly at work, they were faced with major struggles.

By the mid-1960s, the mass of black immigrants had become settlers. Whether or not they entertained ideas about returning 'home' (and there's every reason to believe that a large number of them did) the stark reality of

racial discrimination in all walks of their daily lives in Britain commanded their immediate attention. Gradually during the 1960s and even more so in the  1970s  and  1980s,  their  industrial  struggles,  compounded  by  many instances  of  trade  union  racism,  intensified.  Black  working  class  and political  activists  were  finding  common  ground  during  different  stages  of the struggles.

After  Malcolm  X's  visit  in  1965,  Black  Power  groups  led  by  the activists  Michael X, Obi Egbuna and Roy Sawh came to the aid of black workers  who  had  courageously  taken  strike  action.  From  this  period onwards  the  workplace  would  be  a  battleground  on  which  the  struggles against racial discrimination practised by employers, on the one hand, and trade union racism, on the other, steeled black workers into bitter resistance.

If the racism had been 'hidden' before, by the mid-1960s it was more in the open. The inter-racial tension and Black Power struggles in the United States during this period were paralleled in Britain by a growing sense of injustice  and  black  working-class  consciousness.  The  British  strategy  of divide  and  rule  in  the  colonies  (by  separating  the  African  and  AfroCaribbean from the Asians and Asian-Caribbeans) was replicated in postwar Britain. Such Black Power activists as Roy Sawh (the East Indian from Guyana)  and  Michael  X  (the  Afro-Caribbean),  operating  in  the  British context, recognised this division of labour and were determined not to have it repeated in Britain.

In addition to the state's involvement in race via the 1962 Immigration Act, race became an issue in the 1964 General Election. Perhaps the most galling, and, to some, surprising aspect of racial politics, at this time, was the hypocritical attitude of the Labour Party which had sufficiently aligned itself  with  Blacks  to  warrant  Peter  Griffiths's  (the  Tory  candidate  for Smethwick) comment: 'If you want a nigger neighbour, Vote Labour'. 94

As it happened, the Labour Party won the election and Prime Minister Wilson went on to introduce his White Paper in August 1965. In effect, this was intended to restrict 'coloured immigration'. Later in the year, the Race Relations Act  (September  1965)  was  passed  under  which  Michael  X  was prosecuted  for  inciting  racial  hatred.  Two  other  statutory  bodies  (the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants and the Race Relations Board)  were  set  up  in  the  hope  of  minimising  the  impact  of  racial discrimination  and  racism  on  the  black  community.  The  thinking  behind these bodies was to weaken the rising militancy in the black community by

integrating  the  'leading  lights'  in  CARD  within  the  state's  designs.  No wonder the militants and moderates in CARD were at each other's throats and CARD collapsed as grass roots militancy surged forward towards the latter  part  of  the  1960s.  The  state,  however,  was  more  concerned,  if  not obsessed,  with  putting  a  stop  to  Blacks  coming  to  Britain  rather  than tackling the real and serious problems of the black community.

Moreover,  the  press,  no  friend  of  the  black  community,  gave  its calculated  support  to  the  government.  In  a  well  orchestrated  strategy  the newspaper  influenced  the  mood  of  its  readership,  warning  of  'The  Dark Million' before the government's White Paper. Further, any hint of a black positive  response  was  quickly  discouraged  and  deflected.  Black  Muslims, Black Panthers or Black Power were interpreted as having negative value. Those who suffered gladly, relying on the benevolence of changes coming from  above,  such  as  the  black  middle  class  leaders  of  CARD,  were,  of course, acceptable. Predictably then, the collapse of CARD was lamented by The Times news team who, given the black uprisings abroad, stated 'that the  mixture  of  pro-Chinese  communism and American style Black Power on  the  immigrant  scene  can  be  devastating'.  Clearly,  they  were  more concerned with what 'can be' devastating about black people, completely ignoring what in fact is the devastating black reality that constitutes black resistance.

Time was racing  and  one  could  not  put  the  clock  back,  though  some tried.  Racial  attacks  and  race-hatred  was  stirred  up  by  the  Ku  Klux  Klan. British fascists with grassroots support were encouraged. In February 1967, the  National  Front  was  formed.  Since  1919,  the  position  of  the  black community  had  not  changed.  Gradually,  they  were  becoming  isolated, 'colonised'  in  the  metropole.  Indeed,  the  black  community  faced  a  most formidable opposition in the state which, not content, was intent on further tightening its control over the black 'mob'.

In  the  ensuing  years,  repression  grew  as  state  racism  provoked  black militancy. There were signs that hitherto separate struggles on the shopfloor and  in  the  black  community  were  sporadically  bringing  Asians,  AfroCaribbeans and Asian-Caribbeans together. 95  The goal of black resistance was (still is) to achieve Black Power as systematically set out by its chief advocate, Stokely Carmichael. It was no surprise therefore that the Black Power organisation, UCPA, was formed. Already, the Black Power struggle in America  had  inspired  and  influenced  many  activists  in  Britain  so  that

Carmichael's visit to London in 1967 confirmed their actions and strengthened their resolve.

Egbuna and Sawh were particularly strident in denouncing the oppression  of  black  people.  Through  the  UCPA,  Black  Power  rhetoric, meetings and study groups helped to raise black consciousness; its ideology was  to  politicise  the  black  community.  In  line  with  the  black  radical tradition  of  the  Pan  Africanists  in  Britain,  while  RAAS  stressed  black nationalism, the UCPA focused on the working class struggles abroad.

Confrontations  with  management  involving  Asian  workers  in  April 1967 and 1968 at the  Conegre  Foundry  (Tipton)  and  in  1968  at  Midland Motor Cylinder Company and at the Newby Foundry (West Bromwich) in 1969, given no support or outright opposition from their trade unions, had to  rely  on  the  support  of  their  communities  and  community  organisations such  as  the  IWAs,  the  Pakistani  Welfare  Associations  and  other  black organisations. The community support was especially crucial since some of the  workers'  grievances  involved  'cultural'  questions  which  affected  the whole community. Thus through the lived experience in Britain, the politics and political organisations of the 'home' countries had a bearing on the life and politics of Indian and Pakistani settlers in Britain. Authoritarianism in India was resisted by settlers in Britain. 96 In turn, growing racism in Britain was a source of reciprocal concern to those at 'home'.

By 1968 black class consciousness had become evident. This was the year of the 'Kenyan Asian Act' when Enoch Powell, 'man of the people', alerted the nation (once again on the immigration issue) that 'hundreds of thousands' of Kenyans who held British passports regarded themselves as British.  Earlier  in  the  year,  in  February,  Powell  had  the  support  of  other politicians  and  the Daily  Mirror scare  of  an  'uncontrolled  flood  of Asian migrants from Kenya'. 97

When  the  Bill  was  passed  on  1  March  1968,  the  black  community resisted.  A  sequence  of  events  triggered  off  black  anger.  In  response, Jagmohan  Joshi,  Secretary  of  the  Birmingham  IWA,  called  on  black organisations  to  unite  against  the  Act.  Moreover,  the  assassination  of  Dr Martin  Luther  King  on  4  April  aroused  deep  emotions  which  were compounded a few days later by Powell's 'nightmare' of swarming, black migrants. Although state control of black immigration had tightened, Powell

was not content; the emphasis on the numbers coming in was now being shifted to those already settled in Britain.

The  passage  of  this  racist Act  gave  Powell  political  leverage  and  his supporters  licence  to  abuse  Asians  and  West  Indians;  thus  fascists  went 'paki-bashing'. Attacked  time  and  again,  the  black  community  responded when  representatives  from  over  50  organisations  met  in  Leamington  Spa and formed 'a militant front for Black Consciousness and against racialism' - the BPA. 98

Significantly,  on  the  same  day,  while  the  black  working  class  was constituting itself into a national body, a section of the white working class, the  London  dockers  and  porters  (supporters  of  Powell)  marched  and demanded an end to black immigration. The heightened black consciousness and militancy was reflected in exclusion from BPA membership  of  immigrant  organisations  that  were  involved  with  the government urban aid  programme  or  sought  the  assistance  of  the  Labour Party.

The acceptance of Black Power by the black community was given a boost by the racist 1968 Immigration Act and Powell's incitement to racial hatred speeches. Several black militant organisations, black newspapers and journals came into being. Interestingly, the issues they discussed and were concerned with were not purely British - and fittingly so, since more British capital was invested abroad than at home. For the militant leadership of the black British working class then, the issues were clearly international. The ban on the works of Carmichael and Malcolm X led to a march of Jamaican organisations on their High Commission in London and a sit-in in protest against Walter Rodney's ban from returning to the University of the West Indies.  Moreover,  black  entertainers  and  Michael  X  appeared  in  a  Third World  Benefit  at  the  Round  House  for  the  imprisoned  playwrights  Wole Soyinka in Nigeria, Le Roi Jones in America and Obi Egbuna in Britain. At this time, the words of the Black Panther Movement were prophetic. On 3 October  1968,  they  warned:  'Unless  something  is  done  to  ensure  the protection of our people … we will have no alternative but to rise to their defence. And once we are driven to that position, redress will be too late, Detroit and Newark will inevitably become part of the British scene.' 99

Powell, an historical agent of British racism, having cornered the black community,  now  wanted  to  eliminate  it.  He  called,  in  the  best  British

administrative  tradition, not for a Commission  of  Inquiry,  but  for  a 'Ministry  of  Repatriation'.  For  those  who  did  not  understand  what  he meant, the media obliged by giving Powell ample opportunity to explain his 'Ministry'. Edward Heath, the Tory leader, went further calling a halt to all immigration. Callaghan showed his willingness to move in their direction. Finally  the  Heath  government  passed  the  1971  Immigration  Act.  The dependants  of  black  people  already  in  Britain  were  particularly  affected. The Act reinforced existing practices of bans and entry certificates, stop and search  arrests  and  'sus',  detentions  and  deportations,  intensifying  police harassment of the black community. If life became intolerable for Blacks, they could now, of course, be assisted to go 'home'!

Given  that  cheap  black  labour  in  Britain  was  being  made  redundant because  of  technological  change,  the Act,  it  was  argued,  must  be  seen  in conjunction with the Industrial Relations Act, also passed in 1971. 100

The struggles on the shopfloor and in the community were beginning to merge  more  effectively  and  became  politicised  through  the  Black  Power movement  and  black  political  groups.  This  autonomous  organisation,  in part, reflected the failure of white radicals to recognise the special problems of  the  black  working  class. Thus,  the  black  political  groups  directed  their essential  attention  to  black  struggle  in  the  factories,  schools  and  to  the disturbing  harassment  by  the  police.  Apart  from  the  workplace,  black resistance  was  conducted  at  different  levels,  in  different  places  and  often with different priorities.

The Asian community, for example, more concerned with the entry of families and dependants were involved in legal fights, largely through the JCWI, through  petitioning  and  lobbying.  Later,  from  1972, Asian  leaders also  had  to  contend  with  the  problems  of  resettlement  of  refugees  from Uganda.  Particularly  disturbing  was  the  subjection  of  Asian  women  to vaginal  examination.  The Afro-Caribbean  community,  on  the  other  hand, was concerned with the ESN schools in which their children were dumped.

With  no  assistance  from  the  Race  Relations  Board  (1970)  black  selfhelp was set in motion, spawning a multiplicity of black militant organisations. These projects received spontaneous and widespread support from the black community. It was a movement, gathering all the strands of capitalist oppression.

Police  violence  within  the  black  community  was  nothing  new.  By  the summer of 1969, however, black organisations had begun to monitor police violence against black people. Both the UCPA and the Pakistan Progressive Party protested against 'paki-bashing' in London's East End and elsewhere. Police attacks on the black communities in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Birmingham and Leeds 'put whole communities under siege'.

In  the  fight  against  racism,  a  black  class  interest  emerged,  linking Indians, Pakistanis and West Indians. Their fight was a two-pronged one: as Blacks  and  as  workers.  In  perspective,  their  fight  was  as  a  people  and  a class. This however did not mean 'subsuming the race struggle to the class struggle but by deepening and broadening class struggle through its black and anti-colonial, anti-imperialist dimension'. 101

Essentially,  black  strike  committees,  a  new  phenomenon  in  British industrial relations, appeared to co-ordinate their struggles against intransigent  employers.  In  four  major  instances,  they  were  not  given  the support  of  their  unions,  which  chose  to  oppose  them  instead.  In  fact,  the activities  of  these  strike  committees,  reflected  a  courageous  and  militant stand which highlighted the racism in the trade union movement.

By  the  end  of  the  1970s,  black  youth,  after  a  long  tradition  of  racist violence  directed  at  their  forebears  now  moved  forward  to  accept  the challenge of resisting white racism. Already 'marginalised' by the education system (in fact, dumped in ESN schools) they stepped outside of Babylon and into the popular politics of Rastafarianism. This development, compounded by the deepening recession and no job prospects, given high technology and rising unemployment, left them out of the reckoning. Thus, through the deliberate designs of the state, they became social outcasts. The police,  geared  up,  would  try  to  intimidate  them,  as  they  had  done  their parents  and  other  black  people  before.  Thus,  black  youth  became  the vanguard of the new resistance.

Unlike their parents, this generation of black youth having experienced racism at an early age (in fact 'schooled' in racism) did not intend to suffer gladly. When the Asian youth Gurdip Singh Chaggar was stabbed to death by a gang of white youths in June 1976 in Southall, the elders of the Asian community continued to respond in the old way of passing resolutions. The youths,  however,  had  organised  a  march  to  the  local  police  station. Subsequently, they formed the radical Southall Youth Movement.

The  race-hatred  and  provocation  engendered  by  the  NF  led  to  racial attacks and death to many black people. Black youth moved quickly to form youth movements and defence committees in London, Manchester, Leicester,  Bradford and elsewhere. In addition, anti-racist, anti-imperialist political  groups  were  formed  by  Asians,  Afro-Caribbeans  and  Africans. Their agitations  were  comprehensive; the aim was to politicise the whole black  community. Thus black consciousness was heightened in the 1970s through  the  publications  of Samaj  in  a  Babylon (in  Urdu  and  English  published after the racial attacks during 1976 involving Chaggar's death), and in the wake of the Notting Hill riots and events in Soweto. This was followed by the publications Black Struggle and Mukti . 102 Indeed,  Blacks were  united  against  state  and  police  harassment  and  were  anti-racist  and anti-imperialist.  The  black  community,  nurtured  and  nursed  after  each battering  by  the  state  and  the  police,  relied  heavily  on  the  support  and leadership of black women. Oppressed as mothers and as wives, nonetheless  having  absorbed  the  pain  and  suffering  of  their  communities, they came to add a voice of their own, when the odds were really stacked against them, at the workplace and elsewhere. Their unprecedented struggles  at  Mansfield  Hosiery  Mills,  Imperial  Typewriters,  Grunwick, Futters  and  Chix  and  the  National  Health  Service,  among  others,  has shattered  the  myth  of  the  passive  Asian  woman.  During  the  Grunwick strike, through sheer commitment to their cause of 'racist exploitation' they were  able  as  'green'  trade  unionists  to  get  the  whole  labour  movement behind them. In a marathon stint of picketing they weathered the kicks and punches  of  the  defenders  of  law  and  order  -  the  police.  Thereafter,  the 'friendly Bobby' image was being questioned by British liberals as though they had not already known of past police brutality.

If the police had displayed violence at the Grunwick picket lines, then the  Thatcher  warning  about  immigrants  'swamping'  the  country  gave licence for greater latitude. Media attention helped matters little. In fact, it served to exacerbate the race situation. Powell, the opportunist, was again up  to  his  'induced  repatriation'  tricks. And  in  London  three Asians  were murdered in three months. The NF marches, given wide publicity, received incredible  police  protection. Yet  when  Blacks  asked  for  police  protection from  white  racist  attacks  (in  the  Tower  Hamlets  area,  for  example)  they were denied it. The historical pattern had not changed since 1919. And in

1978 there was absolutely no reason for black people to believe that it was going to change without struggle.

In  1979,  the  NF,  refused  permission  by  Ealing  Council,  was  granted permission to hold meetings in Southall Town Hall where one of the largest Asian communities resided. In response, the Southall community protested peacefully,  to  avoid  this  deliberate  provocation.  But  this  was  not  to  be: again the black community was involved when 2756 police, including SPG units,  moved in to put down the protest. 103 Suddenly because of the lawabiding NF, the local residents could not enter the town centre. The massive police  presence  prevented  the  people  from  moving  back  home  or  to  the Town Hall. They were trapped. The police went 'berserk' allegedly beating one man to death, and seriously injuring hundreds. The police damage to the offices of Black People Unite was symbolic of their disregard for black people.  Bruised  and  battered,  the  Southall Asian  community,  unprepared, had learnt a vital lesson.

The  sense  of  outrage  among  black  people  was  compounded  by  the introduction of Thatcher's Nationality Bill which aroused strong feelings of resistance significantly among  black  women.  By  the  late  1970s,  the cumulative effect of the mounting police harassment gave rise to new types of  struggles  and  'new  leaderships'.  The  black  women's  movement  now gave a lead. Following Grunwick, a major development had taken place as black  women's  groups  came  into  being.  Together,  these Asian  and AfroCaribbean groups through their national body - the Organisation of Women of  Asian  and  African  Descent  (OWAAD),  brought  to  the  struggle  an urgency to issues hitherto neglected, such as class, race and gender, from a black viewpoint. Indeed, they brought to the forefront the issues at the heart of the black community, such as households, children's welfare, child-care, Depo-Provera  and  abortion  law  and  black  prisoner's  rights.  In  1979,  the Brixton Black Women's Group set up the first Black Women's Centre and Asian women joined the campaigns initiated by the United Black Women's Action Group. 104 The  Asian and  Afro-Caribbean women  'herstories' signalled a vital stage in the black community's struggle.

Overall then, by June 1979, under the leadership of the IWA and Blacks Against State Harassment the black community, keyed up to act, embarked on  their  first  national  demonstration.  In  spite  of  these  protests,  however, black youth remained the real target. Deprived, defenceless and disoriented,

they were open to police abuse, charges and violence. 'Sus' and 'mugging' followed them everywhere. None, it seemed, was innocent in the eyes of the police  on  the  beat;  every  one  was  suspected.  Given  police  methods,  the relation  between  the  police  and  the  black  community  had  deteriorated markedly.  Many  black  people  were  kicked  into  the  ground;  they  had  no choice but to resist. They had nothing to lose, except their 'fears'.

Links  between  crowd  violence,  the  current  economic  crisis  and  inner city deprivation,  disadvantage  and  decay  were  denied  by  government ministers. Moreover,  and  in  the  teeth of hard  evidence,  government spokesmen misleadingly insisted that police/ black relations were good. In effect, the state refused to defuse or prevent crowd violence. Instead, it tried to repress it. 105

Given  the  changing  patterns  of  collective  racial  violence  in  Britain, violence  was  integral  to  the  political  struggles  of  the  groups  concerned. Moreover, it is important to see those struggles in the context of race and class in British society, historically. Seen against this background, the 'riot' in  Bristol  on  2  April  1980  could  have  happened  at  any  time  during  the heightened  racism,  exploitation,  repression  and  police  harassment  that confronted the black community  in  the  previous decade, a time of increasing state authoritarianism. 106 Thus, with a larger black presence than ever before in Britain, the state through its policies and practices, engendered  black  resistance  which,  none  too  soon,  exploded  into  open rebellion in the old slave port of Bristol.

The 'Bristol Riot', a significant juncture between race in the 1970s and race in the 1980s, shocked the state, the police and the media and alerted the British public of all shades of opinion to the deep malaise of race and class in British society. Television pictures of the violence in the St Paul's area  of  Bristol  informed  the  public.  This  was  big  news.  Hitherto,  the festering  problems  of  black  people  were  ignored.  Now,  the  newspapers moved in  with  alacrity  to  apportion  blame,  thus  revealing  their  bias.  For example, the crowd violence which occurred was labelled 'The Bristol riot' by the press. On 3 April 1980 some newspaper headlines were:

Pull-out ordered as shops burn 19 police hurt in black riot Hundreds rampage after swoop on Bristol club. 107

The  Guardian reported  that  hundreds  of  angry  youths  went  on  the rampage after a raid  on  a  black  cafe  in  Bristol:  '19  police  hurt  as  rioters burn, loot city streets'. 108 The Daily Mirror stated, 'Gang of Looters Go On Rampage' 109 while The  Times told  its  readers  that  'Hundreds  of  black youths battle with police in Bristol riot'. 110 The emphasis, highly emotive 'police hurt', 'black riot', 'black youths', 'burn', 'loot', 'mob fury' - was clearly  directed  to  solicit  public  outrage  against  the  'black  mob',  and sympathy  for  the  forces  of  law  and  order  in  performing  their  legitimate duty.  In  Bristol,  the  local  papers  were  even  more  alarmist.  The Western Daily Press reported, 'Gangs of coloured youths ran wild; looting, stoning police and starting fires', 111 while The Evening Post from their correspondent in enemy territory, the 'riot zone', reported on the 'war on the streets', involving 1000 rioters on the rampage. 112

This sample of images was used by the press to get the 'riot' across. The black  identity  of  the  'mob'  was  established  and  the  'riot'  was  set  in  the context of the background of the St Paul's area, described in The Guardian as a 'poverty-stricken  black  ghetto' 113 in which  30  per  cent  of  the population was black. Given this tit-bit about a hostile black environment, what  the  press  had  made  abundantly  clear  was  their  concern  for  the  '19 police  hurt',  rather  than  the  'twenty-five  people  injured'.  Further, The Guardian reported:  'When  they  [the  police]  entered  the  club  …  a  large crowd quickly gathered. As the police left they faced a barrage of bricks, stones and bottles. Several officers fell to the ground with head wounds.' And communicating what seemed like extraordinary bravery on the part of the police, the Deputy Chief Constable told the newspaper:

Every time we went in we increased what was a volatile situation and  I  feared  for  the  lives  of  the  policemen.  It  was  a  very,  very dangerous  situation, and  in the interests of the safety of the policemen, and due to the inadequate number I had available, I felt it necessary to withdraw and establish law and order. 114

The police retreat from the St Paul's area, was portrayed by the press as a withdrawal to 'cool down' the situation and 'avoid further confrontation'.

In the same way that Blacks have been linked with crime, so too they are  linked  with  prostitution  and  loose  morals. As  the Daily Mirror put  it:

'Bristol's crime rate is one of the highest among provincial cities. St Paul's is Bristol's poorest area. It is known as a red-light district, with prostitutes openly soliciting on the streets. The area has the city's highest proportion of Blacks.' 115 Interestingly, such public commentators had turned a blind eye on that part of Bristol as an area of 'endless pressure' for Blacks.

Newspaper  editorials  became  more  cautious  as  the  days  passed.  The Daily Mail commented: 'This was not a 'race riot', 116 while The Guardian warned of  the  'appalling  tensions  which  now  exist  between  black  youths and the police'. 117 The Daily Telegraph saw West Indian youth as 'the most serious  problem'  confronting  the  police.  It  added,  their  sub-culture  had  a 'substantial criminal fringe … we are dealing not with black migrants, but with the irresponsible worst group of those migrants'. 118

Significantly, none of the newspapers mentioned explained why socioeconomic  differences  exist  between  Blacks  and  Whites,  or  how  black communities came into being in the inner city. In fact, these questions could only be adequately answered by reference to the roles of racist ideologies and practices. Comments about law and order occupied much space in the press. Indeed, it seemed to be the cure for all social ills. The Guardian was aware of this when it pointed out the disproportionate effect of government policies on the inner city, by calling for a programme to improve housing, job  opportunity  and  education  for  the  black  population. 119 Declaring  its concern,  the  local Western  Daily  Press editorial  stated:  The  future  of  St Paul's  is  now  Bristol's  No.  1  problem.  To  say  it  is  insoluble  is  to  be defeatist; to say that it is a difficult problem with many complexities, is to be realistic.' 120

Overall,  the  nature  of  the  press  reporting  of  the  crowd  violence  in Bristol was 'instrumental not only in the reproduction of racial stereotypes amongst large sections of the white population, but in the alienated sections of  the  black  population'.  Unfortunately,  in  calling  for  government  action most of them meant an increased police presence - the very action that had triggered off crowd violence before.

Clearly in the case of Bristol those Acts of Parliament, structures and agencies designed to lessen the effect of discrimination and racism failed showing  a  callous  disregard  for  the  past  confrontations  and  the  urgent demands of the black community for help.

## Summer 1981

In  the  aftermath  of  the  'Bristol  Riot',  between  April  1980  and  summer 1981, the cumulative effect of racist attacks centred in London (the death of 'Cartoon'  Campbell  in  Brixton  prison  in  March  1980,  and  the  murder  of Akhtar Ali Baig in Newham in July 1980) and the burning to death of 13 young  West  Indians  in  New  Cross  in  January  1981  brought  increased distress to the black community. The crowd violence in Bristol had echoed a wave of deep-seated resentment among black people across Britain.

The violence against Blacks in London reached crisis point following the  New Cross fire. According to one writer, the fire had been started by fascists. The police, however, would have none of it. Before the investigation was over, the police felt that it was (in descending order) the work  of  a  disaffected  black  partygoer,  or  a  prank  which  went  wrong  or maybe an accident. Finally, they 'proved' through forensic expertise that the fire  had  been  self-inflicted  one  way  or  another.  Notably,  there  was  no mention that white, anti-black hooligans (who had been known to terrorise black neighbourhoods) might have been responsible.

The deaths of the black youths and others that took place in the months after the 'Bristol riot' activated black consciousness into top gear. Meetings held  in  New  Cross  were  attended  by  people  from  all  over  Britain.  They came  as  an  act  of  solidarity. A  day  of  action  was  organised  by  the  New Cross  Massacre Action  Committee  and  the  Race Today  Collective,  under the  leadership  of  Darcus  Howe  and  John  La  Rose.  On  2  March,  10,000 people  marched  through  London  in  a  public  demonstration  of  black solidarity. 121 It  was  a  long  march  and  the  few  skirmishes  led  to  several arrests. Nine months after Bristol, this kind of news, it seemed, was to be expected. The  press, once again, attacked the black community  for lawlessness and put forward their pet formula of law and order. The banner headlines were  'mob  violence'  and  'Blacks  on  the  rampage'.  As  if police/black relations had only broken down that day, the press showed its concern  and  thanks  for  the  'Bobby'.  Indeed,  since  the  confrontation  in Bristol, the police had received nothing but encouragement. Not surprisingly, then, cock-a-hoop, (and no wonder they were, with might on their  side)  the  police  antagonised  black  people  in  Brixton  while  fascists baited Southall.

The period after the New Cross Massacre demonstration in March 1981 was a troubled one in terms of police/Blacks relations. There were clashes with  the  police  over  the  Deptford  demonstration  in  Coventry  in  May, Thornton Heath in June and on two separate occasions in July in Southall. The  'massacre'  struck  deep  responses  within  the  black  communities.  The tinder  was  there,  it  needed  only  a  spark.  That  spark  was  lit  (after  a  long period  of  intense  police  harassment)  in  Brixton  on  Friday  10 April  1981. Brixton  was  set  ablaze  as  violence  continued  for  three  days.  In  terms  of intensity,  Bristol  was  dwarfed.  Petrol  bombs  were  used  setting  many buildings  alight;  a  fire  symbolic  of  a  burning  desire  for  human  dignity among a shamefully oppressed people. For the record, the police made 200 arrests. 122

The  estimated  £10  million  damage  to  property  in  Brixton  had  deeper political significance. Lord  Scarman  was  called  upon  to  provide  an explanation (as though the government did not already know the causes of this black revolt in the heart of the metropole). Brixton, like Bristol, was not regarded  as  a  'race  riot'  and  saturation  policing  as  a  possible  cause  was dismissed.  More  plausible  was  the  'outside  agitator'  theory.  This  was another  example  of  a  dishonest  approach  to  a  grave  social  problem.  The idea  of  extraneous  forces  then,  was  given  credibility  by  the  police  and press. The Assistant Commissioner of Police said that a number of people were 'seen to be in an organising position with black youths'. 123 The Daily Express aware of the social tinder, asked 'Who lit the fuse of fury? 124

The following weekend, 17-20 April, Blacks and police clashed again in Finsbury Park and Ealing Common in London. And in the seaside resorts Brighton, Scarborough and Margate, violence broke out between skinheads, punks and rockers. In May a protest march against violent racial attacks in Coventry, organised by the Asian community and anti-racist groups, led to confrontations in Thornton Heath and in parts of London.

By the end of June, the violence continued in London with little action elsewhere. July proved to be an historic month. The 'July riots' marked a turning point in British politics. Black youth, no longer able to contain their feelings  of  bitterness  and  frustration,  acted  together  on  the  streets  against the  police. And for the sceptics who were prone to dismiss the Blacks as 'hot-heads',  it  was  significant  that  white  youths  also  joined  the  violent protests;  in  effect,  race  and  class  had  become  the  battle  cry.  In  Liverpool

and  other  cities,  black  and  white  youths,  faced  with  an  oppressive  and tangible force, in desperation, petrol-bombed the police, police stations and police vehicles. If there was any doubt that the violent racial attacks were the  source  of  animosity  against  the  police  and  against  organised  fascist groups and could lead to more generalised violence, the evidence was clear in the violence in Southall 3-5 July.

As the  fires  burned  in  Southall,  collective  racial  violence  (an  integral part  of  the  history  of  race,  and  black  settlement  in  Britain  during  the twentieth  century)  erupted,  almost  simultaneously,  in  some  29  cities  and towns in the summer of 1981.

British immigration legislation which has clearly indicated that 'blacks are  not  wanted  here'  is  a  fact  known  intimately  by  all  black  people  in Britain.  Racial  discrimination  and  racial  disadvantage,  and  the  sub-class position of the black working class vis-à-vis the white working class has led black cultural and political organisations across the country, to achieve and acknowledge (at various levels), for the first time, a national black workingclass consciousness - the inevitable outcome of race and class oppression.

According to E. P. Thompson, the English working class 'made itself as much as it was made'. He adds crucially:

Class consciousness is the way in which the experiences are handled in  cultural  terms:  embodied  in  traditions,  value-systems,  ideas  and institutional  forms.  If  the  experience  appears  as  determined,  class consciousness does not … class is defined by men as they live their own history, and, in the end, this is its only definition. 125

Indeed,  an  integral  part  of  these  'cultural  terms'  was  racialism.  Thus historically, the practices and policies of British capital that have made the English working class, ironically, in turn, received the general endorsement of  the  white  working  class  in  the  making  of  the  black  working  class  in Britain.

## Conclusion

At the Centenary Conference held in Winnipeg, Canada, in March 1983 to mark  Karl  Marx's  death,  Ralph  Miliband,  reflecting  the  spirit  of  the Conference said: 'Today Marxism is full of contradictions, full of holes. …

But just as Marx was inspired throughout by a magnificent optimism, in due course we can reach ever closer to fulfil Marxism's potential and we share in that optimism. For peace and socialism, let us advance together.' A truly worthy vision.

Nevertheless,  black  working-class  autonomous  organisation  is  today's reality, necessitated and conditioned by institutionalised racism. Historically,  the  trade  unions,  the  Labour  Party  and  the  British  working class  generally  (in  spite  of  their  hollow,  hypocritical  pronouncements  of 'the brotherhood of man') have actively helped to make and maintain this fracture within the class. They must know, more than ever before, that it is incumbent  on  them  to  listen  and act on  the  representations  of  black autonomous organisations. The disadvantages are too glaring to legitimise mere reforms.

At  the  outset,  as  a  'class',  black  workers  were  deliberately  made: policies  and  practices  determined  their  colonial  backgrounds  and  created the conditions for their emigration to Britain; made them live and work in the  decaying  inner  city  environments;  made  them  accept  low  pay,  bad housing,  unemployment,  sub-standard  education;  made  them  feel  guilty when  receiving  state  welfare  benefits;  and  made  them  the  subjects  of humiliating public repatriation debates.

Indeed,  the  black  working  class  have  been  socially,  economically  and politically pushed to eking out an existence (and a precarious one at that!) on the  fringe  of  British  society.  Thus  made,  they  have  been  criticised  for being a 'society' apart, alien. While much political capital has been made from this, their alienation brought deepening impoverishment and desperation. Wherever and whenever their exploitation had become unbearable, they fought courageously  for redress, particularly at the workplace.  In  so  doing,  they  consistently  campaigned  for  solidarity  with white workers, significantly, without success.

It is evident, however, that the black British will not suffer gladly while they  wait  (as  their  forebears  on  the  colonial  plantations  and  mines  were asked to) for a 'dispensation from above' to be free from the trammels of their 'makers'.  Thus,  through  a  painful  process  of  heightened  social, economic and political awareness, the lessons of the past have been learnt, at  every  turn  of  the  authoritarian  screw.  Their  intentions  are  clear.  In  the face of oppression, they will do as black, oppressed people (under slavery, indentureship,  imperialism,  colonialism,  neo-colonialism  and,  today,  as

secondclass citizens in Britain) have always done, wage a struggle for their freedom, for their civil rights in the teeth of the forces ranged against them.

Their  history  of  struggle  against  racism  and  harassment  has  evolved from resistance to open rebellion. Indeed, the black working class in Britain have taken the initiative in the class struggle. While they may hope for a positive response from the white 'labour aristocracy' and the white working class  generally,  their  autonomous  struggle  (the  direct  result  of  British racism)  will  continue  as  their  urgent,  insistent  demands  extend  to  every aspect of their essential deprivation.

## VI James Townsend: Pioneering Black Politician

James  Townsend  was  born  in  1737  and  baptised  on  8  February  at  St Christopher-le-Stocks in London. He was the son of Chauncy Townsend, a Member  of  Parliament,  and  Bridget,  the  daughter  of  James  Phipps  of Wiltshire. James Townsend's African ancestry can be traced on his mother's side to his grandmother. His grandfather was James Phipps, who had served as Governor General of the Royal African Company at Cape Coast Castle. After  being  deposed  from  his  top  position,  Phipps  stayed  in  Africa;  and overall he worked and lived on the Gold Coast for twenty years. During this time he met and married an African woman named Catherina. She was a mulatto, a person of mixed-race. Known locally as a 'Consa' (the African wife  of  a  European),  Catherina  bore  Phipps  five  children,  four  of  whom (Bridget,  Susanna,  Henrietta  and  Thomas)  survived  to  become  adults. According to one account, they were of 'fair complexion'. Catherina was a woman of strong character, a 'Strict Adherer to the Negrish Customs', John Atkins,  a  Navy  surgeon,  wrote.  Surprised  by  Phipps's  behaviour,  Atkins added that he 'was a gentleman of good sense, yet could not help yielding

to the silly customs created by our Fears … He cannot persuade this woman to  leave  the  country  tho'  he  has  stole  or  forced  her  consent  for  all  the children  in  regard  to  their  education'.  He  doted  on  this  woman  who  was 'always barefoot and fetished with chains and objects of gold at her ankles, her wrists and her hair'.

Being married to an African woman was one thing, but insisting that she accompany  him  to  England  was  quite  unusual.  Though  Phipps  seldom mentioned her in his correspondence, according to his will his intention was that  Catherina  should  come  to  England  as  his  legal  wife.  Such  a  move, however,  was  likely  to  have  its  downside.  Phipps's  close  friend  Seth Grosvenor expressed his concern. He wrote:

As to your intentions of bringing Catherina with you to England … in my opinion it would be much more agreeable to her to remaine in the  Country  than  to  bring  her  heare  among  Strangers  where  she would most certainly be uneasy and Slighted, and then put to [the] Trouble and Experience of sending her back againe. There I think it more prudent … and … it would be to her satisfaction to leave her handsome allowances.

When Bridget and Susanna arrived in London, sometime between 1714 and  1715,  Phipps's  brother  Thomas  was  taken  by  surprise.  'Grosvenor disclosed  to  me  yesterday',  he  wrote  on  24  June  1715,  'of  some  issue  of yours he brought over with him, two you thought not fit to disclose to me, yet on his discovery I offered to put them out to School which I shall do on Monday.' Later, Henrietta and Thomas followed. In his will, James Phipps left money  to  cover  the  cost  of  his  children's  'Boarding,  Schooling, Clothing and other necessaries'.

In May 1770 Bridget married Chauncy Townsend and had ten children with him, including James Townsend, who was the eldest son. He studied at Hertford College, Oxford, but left in 1756 without taking a degree. Instead, he was keen to enter politics. Fortuitously, through his marriage on 3 May 1763  to  Rosa  Peregrima  du  Plessis,  'the  illegitimate  daughter  of  Henry Hare, third and last Baron of Coleraine, James secured possession of Hare's estate in Tottenham, Middlesex', he gained 'financial independence'. This prepared the way for his chosen career.

He was ambitious and aimed high. Soon he formed an association with the  highly  respected  and  influential  Lord  Shelburne  who,  as  Secretary  of State in the Chatham Ministry, helped Townsend to enter parliament as the representative  for  the  Cornish  borough  of  West  Looe  following  a  byelection in 1767. Thus he became the first Black Member of Parliament. At the  general  election  the  following  year,  he  was  re-elected.  The  young politician learned fast and acted positively. He became a founder member of the Society of Supporters of the Bill of Rights, formed in February 1769; and in June 1769 he was elected as a 'lifetime Alderman and annual Sheriff in the City of London'.

Determined  to  follow  the  radical  path  he  chose,  he  joined  others  in support of a new Constitutional Society. This move had serious consequences for City of London politicians. For one thing, the split leading to  the  existence  of  two  societies  enabled  a  government  supporter  to  be elected  lord  mayor  in  1771.  To  prevent  this  happening  again,  for  the following year's election John Wilkes and Townsend stood 'on a joint ticket for  the  office  of  Mayor  which  was  chosen  by  Aldermen  from  the  top candidates'.  In  this  contest,  if  Wilkes  was  the  front  runner,  what  was Townsend's role? If, as Wilkes thought, it was just to help him to win the Mayoralty, Townsend was ready to spring a surprise. Instead of supporting Wilkes,  Townsend  changed  his  mind;  and  in  the  'fierce  struggle'  that followed, with the support of a 'Coalition of Hornites and Courtiers', James Townsend was elected Lord Mayor of London in November 1772. This was another big achievement, the first Black man to hold this office. Predictably, there  was  great  animosity  between  Wilkes  and  Townsend;  and  on  Lord Mayor's Day, Townsend's 'treachery' resulted in a riot. So unpopular had he  become  that  when  he  appeared  on  the  campaign  trail  for  the  General Election  in  1774  'vehement  abuse  forced  his  withdrawal'.  Nonetheless, Townsend's  portrait  as  Lord  Mayor  was  painted  by  Joshua  Reynolds  in March 1773. As Mayoress, his wife also sat for Reynolds.

For his part as a public figure, Townsend showed radical tendencies and spoke  forcefully  for  parliamentary  reforms  and  annual  parliaments.  Until 1787, he continued to make strong representations, including opposition to the  impeachment  of  Warren  Hastings. According  to  the  diarist  Nathaniel Wraxall, though he 'seldom mingled in debate, he manifested whenever he spoke  a  manly  mind,  great  facility  of  expression,  strong  sense  combined with upright principles of action.' Much of these sterling qualities were, it

seemed, inherited from the character of his maternal African grandmother Catherina.  James  Townsend  died  at  Bruce  Castle,  Tottenham,  on  1  July 1787. His wife died on 8 November 1785.

From  all  that  I  have  read,  James  Townsend  MP,  was  clearly  of  light complexion,  so  much  so  that  none  of  the  official  pre-2016  biographical accounts of him as a public figure - in places such as Notes and Queries , the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography or The History of Parliaments, Commons - mentions either his colour or his African lineage. Nonetheless,  his  mother,  Bridget,  his  siblings, and  children  were  all descendants of the African woman from the Gold Coast. In addition to these official  profiles,  the  recently  published  article  in Notes  and  Queries by Wolfram  Latsch  sheds  much  light  on  James  Townsend's  dark  past.  My thanks to Professor David Skilton for his query about Latsch's article. This led  to  further  research  at  the  National  Archives  and  the  British  Library, which  is  presented  here.  Hopefully  the  little  known  contribution  of  this pioneering  radical  Black  politician,  like  much  of  the  'hidden'  histories  in The Making of the Black Working Class in Britain , will now become more widely known.
