       PREFACE
        The object of this volume is to furnish our Cottoir
      Merchants, Brokers, Sj)inners, and Manufacturers, with a hand}'
     Manual of Historical and Economical information al>out the
     Commerce and Industry in Avhich they are engaged. A long
       practical experience, including much correspondence, has sug-
      gested the character of the information supplied, and the
     method of setting it forth. The staple industrj- of Lan-
       cashire and portions of the neighbouring counties, as known
       to the present generation, was founded scarcely a hundred
      years ago by the genius of Hargreaves, Arkwright, Crompton,
     and CartAvright ; but for se\'eral centuries prioi' to the
      manufacture of the first piece of British calico, constant
       efforts had been made to produce fabrics similar to the
       fustians and calicoes imported from the Mediterranean and
      the far East. An account of these efforts, and of the success
      which eventually attended them, is given in the first and
      second chapteis of Pai:t I. This is followed, in the third
       chapter, by a summary of the mechanical inventions and
      improvements brought out during the present century—con-
      cluding Avith a descrij)tion of the machinery employed in a

       Tnoclern Cotton mill. (^) Then follow two chapters on the
      economical results of the inveiition of the Water-Frame, the
      Mule, and the Power-Loom, and of the various improvements
       thereon, down to the present day: ending with a statement of
      the number of Operatives, and amount of Capital, employed
       in the industry. After this come chapters on the Factory
     and Census Keturns; on the Supply of Cotton since 1781; on
      the relative positions of England, the Continent, the United
       States, and India, as producers of Cotton fabrics ; on the
       DejDression of Trade in 187o-9 and 188.3-5, including remarks
     upon Foreign competition, and on the Reciprocity delusion
      on the relative importance of the Cotton, AVoollen, and Linen
       industries at various periods for a century back • on the
     Oldham Cotton mills ; and on the consumption, Ijy the
       various countries of the world, of British and Irish Cotton
       manufactures.
       Part II. contains a history of the Liverpool Cotton
      Market, and of the customs which have obtained therein,
       since its origin in the last centurj-. Also a history of the
       Liverpool Cotton Brokers' Association, from its foundation in
      1841 until its amalgamation with the Liverpool Cotton
      Exchange in 1882, including an account of the circumstances
      which led uj) to the formation of the Amalgamated [Association.]
       In this Part, too, will be found some Gleanings and Remini-
       scences about old Cotton Brokers and their Offshoots ; being a
       revised reprint of a series of articles Avhicli originally appeared
        in the columns of the IArerp(xil Daily Post. They are by
                        ( ' ) The description contained on pages 38 to 4G was kindly [written][ for]
        this volume by Mr. Henry Schotield, of Oldham.

      general request reproiliiced in this volume as a souvenir of the
       late Cotton Brokers' Association. To these sketches are added
      chapters on the Cotton Clearing House, on the Cotton Bank,
     and on Periodical Settlements.
        In the Appendix will be found important Statistical and
      other matter—bringing the history of the trade down to the
       latest date.
        This Avork was promised some time ago ; but its pub-
       lication has been unavoidably delayed. The delay, however,
      has enabled the author to add a Supplementary Chapter on
      current topics, Avhich will probably be found to be not the
       least interesting? in the volume.

           PAKT I.
   THE COTTON TRADE OF GREAT BRITALN.
          CHAPTER I.
      HISTORICAL SKETCH DOWN TO THE OPENING OF THE
            EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.
       Introchiction of the Cotton Industry from India, its birth-place, into
         Eastern, and eventually into Western, Europe.—In England preceded
       by the woollen manufactures originally introduced from Flanders.
       The term ["] Manchester Cottons ["] first applied to imitations of certain
          fabrics imj)orted from the Mediterranean.—Position of the industry in
         the seventeenth century.—English Woollen manufacturers jealous of
          Irish competitors and of foreign imports. —Agitation against imports of
         Calicoes from India.—Legislative protective enactments passed at the
          close of the seventeenth and opening of the eighteenth centuries.
       The popularity of the Indian goods leads to imitations composed of
        Cotton Weft and Linen Warp, and suggests the desirability of such
        improvements in the existing machinery as would enable our Spinners,
          to prodiice a Cotton Yarn suitable for Warp, and so render it possible
          to make a nearer approach to the Indian article.
    India is undoubtedly the birthplace of the cotton manufacture.
      It is known from the sacred books of the country that the in-
     dustry must have been in existence there, in a high state of
      perfection, three thousand years ago ; but how long before that
     period is not known. Moreover, it may be gathered from
    numerous authorities that the arts of cotton spinning and cotton
     weaving, as practised there twenty or thirty centuries ago, differed
     very slightly from the methods followed throughout India
     until within a very recent period. Fabrics as fine as any

        tliat can be turned out at the present clay, by the most perfect
     machinery in Lancashire, were produced by the nimble fingers
      of Hindoo spinners, and the primitive looms of Hindoo weavers,
     a thousand years before the invasion of Britain by the Romans
  —in fact, at a period when the inhabitants of the British Isles
     were attired in the skins of wild animals, the leading people of
      India were luxuriating in garments of a texture so fine as to
     have earned the poetic description of " v/oven v/ind," and what
        is still more astonishing is the circumstance that the cotton,
     with which this wonderful perfection was attained, v/as the
     much despised Surats, and still more despised Bengals, of modern
       times. In course of time the trade in cotton and cotton goods
      spread from India v/estwards. Herodotus, the historian (484 B.C.),
     and Nearchus, Alexander's [admiral] (325 [B.C.),] both make mention
      of the Indian cotton tree and[ the][ cloth] made therefrom ; [and][ there]
        is no doubt that [in][ their] [day][ the][ export][ of][ Indian][ falwics][ to][ Persia,]
       Eo"ypt, and Eastern Europe was an established trade, though
      possibly not a very [extensive] one. Strabo, Avho flourished just
      before the com^mencement[ of][ the][ Christian] Era, mentions cotton
       as a product of [Persia,] [and][ Pliny][ says that][ the][ cultivation] of the
      plant was carried on[ in] [Egypt][ in][ the][ year] 70 A.D. Arrian, who
      flourished about the middle of the second century, enumerates
      cotton fabrics as among the articles imported hy the Eomans
     from India, and describes very minutely the trade cari-ied on
      betv/een Bengal, [Madras,][ Guzerat,][ and][ several] ports in the Red
       Sea. By and by [the][ cultivation][ of][ the][ plant][ found][ its] vv^ay from
      Persia into Turkey and Greece, and from Egypt into North
       Africa, and thence [over][ to] Spain and[ Italy.] The Moors are said to
      have introduced [the][ culture][ into][ Spain][ in][ the][ eighth][ century,] but
     we have no [authentic][ mention][ of][ cotton][ spinning][ and][ weaving][ in]
     Europe earlier than 950, about vfhich time, and for several
      centuries later, an [extensive] manufacture was[ carried] on[ at][ Seville,]
      Cordova, and Grenada. The industry, however, fell into decay
       after the expulsion of the Saracens, toAvards the close of the
       fifteenth century, and was[ not][ restored][ until][ within][ recent] times.
     The manufacture made[ its][ appearance][ in][ Italy] in the fourteenth

      century. By the middle of the sixteenth century it was estab-
      lished in Germany, Prussia, Saxony, and the Netherlands. A
        little later came England. France followed in the seventeenth
      century, and Russia in the eighteenth.
          It is important to note, however, that though the art of
      spinning cotton wool had spread over Europe, in the manner and
      in the chronological order just mentioned, there is no record of
        its yarn having been woven into cloth until towards the close of
       last century, except along with warp spun from either wool, flax,
        •or silk. This was true at all events of Western Europe. The
        first recorded import of cotton into England took place in 1298.
      It was used for the manufacture of candle-Avicks. Several
      authorities mention the occasional arrival of small quantities of the
       fibre from the Mediterranean at various dates down to 1560, and
      the probability is that these imports were used chiefly, if not
       •entirely, for candle-wicks. Mention is made of "Manchester
      cottons" as early as 1352, and at various dates down to 1641 ;
     but these were really not cotton goods, but fabrics composed of
     wool and cotton or linen and cotton. Fustians were imported from
     the Continent as early as 1601, a.nd calicoes from Calicut, in India,
      thirty years later ; [but] the fustians and calicoes made in England
      at that period, and for more than a century afterwards, were mere
      imitations, som..etimes all wool and at other times partly cotton.
     But although the cotton manufacture, as it is at present under-
       .stood, is only of comparatively modern origin, its foundations
     were really laid centuries ago in precisely the same county in
     which it is now the great and characteristic industry. The
      pioneer fabric was wool, and the starting point Flanders. The
      arts of spinning and weaving wool were introduced into England
     by the Romans, and early historians mention the industry at
      various dates up to the tenth century ; [but][ the][ progress][ made][ was]
      very slow, and the origin of the manufacture, as we now under-
      stand the Avord, is generally associated with the arrival of a
     number of Flemish immigrants during the reign of William the
      Conqueror. These operatives, as we should call them now-a-days,
     had dwelt upon land reclaimed from the sea, but a sudden and

     overwhelming incursion swept away their dykes and they were-
        left Avithout a home. On this they turned their attention to
     England as offering a profitable field for their industry. They
      sought the patronage of the Queen, who was a countrywoman of
       theirs, and were cordially received and located in the North. Others
      followed in succeeding reigns, and were settled in various districts
       of the country. But supremacy in the manufacture of wool long
     remained with Flanders, though England stood first as the pro-
      ducer of the raw material. Hallam says that ["] a writer of the
      thirteenth century asserts that all the world was clothed from
      English wool wrought in Flanders." This, of course, is an ex-
      aggeration, but it shows the importance of the industry and the
       relative positions of the two countries at the time. The Flemish
      weavers were frequently at loggerheads with their rulers and
      corporations ; but, spite of continued wars and corporate oppres-
       sions, the industry continued to flourish, and only comparatively
     few emigrants came over to England until the reign of Edward
      III (1327-1377). This sovereign, Avhom Hallam justly styles the
      father of English commerce, was by one of the French kings nick-
     named the "wool merchant," on account of the anxiety which he
      displayed te transfer the woollen industry from Flanders to-
      England. The circumstance that Edward had married the
      daughter of a Flemish count afi'orded him exceptional means of
      putting his plans into execution. Early in his reign he sent over
      messengers to invite the discontented Flemings to come and take
     up their abode in England, where it was said they would be
     much happier than in their own country. The King's emissaries
      painted the advantages of the change in glowing colours. At
     home, to quote the account of Fuller, given in his ["] Church
      History," they were ["] early up and late in bed, and all day hard
     work and harder fare, and all to enrich their masters without any
       profit to themselves. But, oh ! how happy should they be [if] they
     would but come over to England, bringing their [mystery,][ which]
     would provide them welcome in all places ! Here they should
      feed on fat beef and mutton till nothing but their fulness should
       stint their stomachs," and, what was [still] better, "the[ richest][ yeomen.]

       in England would not disdain to marry their daughters unto them,
     ^nd such the English beauties that most envious foreigners could
      not but commend them." The result was that, in 1331, about
      seventy families came over and were settled, says Baines, in York,
      Kendal, Halifax, Manchester, the districts of Eossendale and
      Pendle, and other places. Their settlement was for a time op-
      posed by the existing woollen interests, and, says Hallam, ["] it cost
     Edward no little trouble to protect his colonists from the selfish-
      ness and from the blind nationality of the vulgar. " (^) Prior to the
       arrival of these immigrants the art of weaving was so backward
       in England that Fuller says that the English knew no better
     what to do with their wool than the sheep that wore it, and that
       their best clothes were no better than friezes ; now, however,
      England was in a position to compete with the Flemish manu-
      factures in the production of the higher descriptions of cloth,
     and also in the manufacture of what were called " Manchester
       cottons," but which were in fact all wool fabrics, made in
      imitation of certain popular cloths imported from' the Mediter-
      ranean. It is a fair inference, in fact, that the production of these
       so-called cottons was introduced by Edward's colonists, inasmuch
         :as the first time we meet with the name occurs twenty-one years
       after the date at which the colonists arrived. From the time of
      Eihvard the Third the industry continued to make more or less
      important progress, and was frequently the subject of legislative
      •enactments of a controlling, encouraging, and protective character.
     The export of sheep was 2:)rohibited in 1338, and a similar interdict
      was shortly afterwards placed upon the trade in wool; so that instead
      of exporting the raw material, England began to exjiort cloth, at
        first to Germany, Flanders, and Russia, and eventually to Spain
     and Italy. In 1585 a considerable impetus was given to the
      whole of the textile industries by another extensive immigration
       of Flemish capitalists and artizans driven out of their owii country
     by the crvielties of the Duke of Alva. Many of these settled down in
      the neighbourhood of Manchester, and, as an encouragement, were
                      (^) " History of Europe," vol. iii., p. 322.

      for the small charge of 4cl. per annum, allowed by the wardens and
      fellows of the college to cut timber for firing, and for the construction
       of looms, out of the extensive woods belonging to the foundation. (^)
      This new influx of weavers increased the demand for yarn, and
      hastened the development of a change which had already com-
     menced to show itself in the character of the fabrics produced in
      Manchester. The linen manufacture had been introduced into
     England in the thirteenth century, and in Lancashire had grown
     up side by side with the woollen industry, until it attained a
      position as important as that of wool itself, and [eventually] became
      the immediate predecessor of the cotton [manufacture.] The po-
       sition of things early in the seventeenth [century][ is][ very][ clearly]
      stated by Lewis Eoberts, in a work called "The Treasure of
       Traffic," published in 164L "The toAvn of Manchester buys [the]
      linen yarn of the Irish in great quantity, and, weaving it, re-
      turns the same again into Ireland to sell. Neither doth their
      industry rest here, for they buy cotton wool in London, that
     comes from Cyprus and Smyrna, and work the same into
       fustians, vermillions, and dimities, and then return it to London,
     where the same is sold, and not seldom sent into [foreign][ parts]
    who have means, at far easier terms, to [provide][ themselves][ of][ the]
      said fii:st materials." It does not folloAV that because Man-
      chester imported linen yarn from Ireland she returned thence
      linen cloth : it is not at all unlikely that [part][ of][ the][ exports][ would]
      consist of the mixed fabrics which had been [gradually] coming
      into use. Ireland had a small but growing [woollen][ industry] ; [but]
       as this was considered to be injurious to [the] [woollen] interests of
     England, its progress was discouraged and eventually rigorously
      opposed, though everything was done to promote [and][ improve][ the]
      linen industry which was considered to be more suitable for
      Ireland. This led to the production of more yarn [than][ was][ re-]
      quired l)y the Irish weavers, and thus left a [surplus] available for
      export to Manchester, in the way [narrated] by[ Roberts.] (-)
       The woollen manufacture had from the first been the pet

     imUistiy of the country, and had always been regarded as a
     main source of national wealth. Hence the jealousy witli whicli
     everything calculated to interfere with its welfare Avas viewe 1,
     not only hy those immediately interested, but also by the leading
     statesmen and public vmters of the time. Out of this arose the
      restraint placed upon the woollen trade of Ireland ; [and][ out][ of] it
      also originated the cry against the import of cotton fabrics from
      India. The first arrival of these took place in 1631, ten years
      before Roberts wrote his account of Manchester. But they
     became so poimiar that quite a clamour was raised against their
     import on the ground that they were ruining one of the main-
      stays of national prosperity. It is not at all unlikely, however,
      that the depression whicli had overtaken the manufacture, Avas
     due more to the loss of trade—home and export— occasioned by
      the political disturbances of the time (which included the whole
      of 'the revolutionary period) than to the displacement of domestic
      m^ade woollens by Indian cottons. The Avhole question was
     frequently debated in Parliament and Avas the subject of
     numerous patriotic pamphlets. One of the latter, published in
      1678, and entitled, ["] The Ancient Trades [Decayed][ and][ Repaired]
     Again," saj'-s, ["] This trade (the AA^oollen) is very much hindered
    by our own people, AAdro do Avear many foreign commodities
      instead of our OAvn." "Instead of green say, that Avas AA^ont to be
     used for children's frocks, is noAV used painted and Indian-stained,
     and striped calico ; [and] instead of a perpetuana or shalloon to
     lyne men's coats with, is used sometimes a glazened [calico,][ Avhich,]
     on the Avhole, is not above 12d. cheaper, and abundantly Avorse.
    And sometimes is used a Bangale, that is brought from India,
     both for lynings for coats and for petticoats, too ; [yet][ our][ English]
     ware is better and cheaper than this, only it is thinner for the
     summer. To remedy this it Avould be necessary to lay a very
     high impost upon all such commodities as these are, and [that] no
      calicoes or other sort of linen be suffered to be glazened." The
     cry for more protection came chiefly from the manufacturers of
      Spitalfields, Norwich, Yorkshire, and Wiltshire. Manchester ap-
      pears to have been quiescent, and was probably [busily] engaged[ in]

     making imitations of [the] much-denounced [Indian][ imports.] Lord
      Macaulay, summarising the situation, says that ["] the importation
      of sUks and Bengals, [as][ sha^rls][ were][ then][ called,][ was][ pronoimced]
      to be a curse to [the][ coimtry.] The effect of the growing taste for
      such fi'ippery [Avas] that [oiu-][ gold] [and][ silver][ went][ abroad,][ and][ that]
     much excellent English di-apery lay in om- warehouses till it was
      devoured by the moths. Those, it was said, were happy days for
      the inhabitants both of our pasture lands and of our manufac-
      turing towns, when every gown, every waistcoat, every bed was
     made of matei-ials which our own flocks had furnished to oiu*
     own looms. "NMiere were now the brave old hangiags of arras
       Avhich had adorned the walls of lordly mansions in the time of
      Elizabeth ? And was it not a shame to see a gentleman whose
      ancestors had worn nothing but stuffs made by English workmen
      out of English fleeces, [flaunting][ in a][ calico shirt][ and][ a][ pair][ of] silk
      stockings from Moorshedabad 1 ["(^)] But the Indian trade was too
      important, its hold upon the public imagination too strong, its
       safety in the powerful hands of the East India Company too
        seciu-e to be in the least [interfered] [with][ ;] [and][ the][ only][ legislative]
       result of the agitation was the passage of an Act designed [to]
      secure the more effectual observance of the somewhat grim, but
      constantly evaded measure (originally passed in 1666), [which]
      enacted that every dead person should be buried in a wooUen
      shroud, in default of which the persons directing the fimeral
      should forfeit the sum of £5. If the people while alive were so
       jjerverse and unpatriotic as to prefer foreign to [domestic] fabrics
       for their vestments, they [should][ at] [aU] events not be allowed [to]
       carry their fripperies with them[ to][ the][ grave.]
        Although the efforts made to induce Parliament to place
      some restriction upon the increasing import of Eastern fabrics
      were not rewarded with success, the agitation on[ behalf] of pro-
       tection was not only kept [aHve,] but [became][ more][ powerful][ as][ time]
      went on. In 1685 about -50,000 out of over half-a-miUion
      Huguenots were driven out of France by [the] revocation of the
       edict which for a century had guaranteed to them religious

      liberty, arrived in England, and settled in Spitalfields and other
      places, introducing several new branches of silk and other fabrics
     which came into flirect competition with the Indian imports.
     Of course these newcomers by degrees swelled the ranks of the
      protectionists. Meanwhile the trade with the East continued to
     •grow in magnitude, so much so that the wiiter of a pamphlet
      entitled ["] The Xaked Trutl;, in an Essay upon Trade," pubUshed
     in 1696, stated that the muslins and silks imported by the
    Company were ["] becoming the general wear in England [;"] and
      then, in a tone of contempt, he goes on to say, " Fashion is truly
     termed a witch ; [the][ dearer] and[ scarcer] any commodity the more
     the mode ; 30s. a yard for muslins, and only the shadow of a
     commodity when procured I"'
          T^Tiile the agitation agaiast the Indian imports had been
     going on, the textile industries of Ireland had made very fair
      progress ; cheaper Hving and lower wages had attracted capital
     from England and the Continent ; and spite of preA'ious opposi-
      tion and discouragement, the Irish woollen trade had attained
     such a position, both in respect of the exjDort of the raw material
     and in that of the production of the manufactured article, as to
      materially curtail the demand for English products, and, there-
       fore, to excite anew the jealousy and apprehensions of the Enghsh
     manufacturers, who by numerous petitions ui'ged both Houses of
     ParHament to come to the rescue of the alleged jeopardized in-
      <lustrv. As Ireland had no corporation like the East India
     Company, poweiiul and popular enough to take care of its interests,
       its illiberal rivals had an easy victory. On the 9th June, 1698,
      the House of Lords, in an address to the Iving, said[—][ '•] AVe, the
      lords spiritual and temporal in Parhament assembled, do humbly

      the further growth of it may greatly prejudice the said manufac-
      ture here [;"] . . " wherefore, we do most humbly beseech your

      most sacred Majesty, that your Majesty atouIcI be pleased, in the
      most puWic and effectual way, to declare to all your subjects of
        Ireland, that the growth and increase of the woollen manufacture
        there, hath long, and will ever be looked upon with great jealousy,
      by all your subjects of this kingdom : And if not timely remedied
     may occasion very strict laws, totally to prohibit and suppress the
      same ; [and] on the other hand, if they turn their industry and
         skill, to the settling and improving of the linen manufacture, for
       v/hich generally the lands of the kingdom are very proper, they
        shall receive all countenance and favour and protection from your
       royal influence." On the 10th of June the Lord Steward re-
       ported that ["] his Majesty Avill take care to do what their lordships
      have desired." On the -SOth of the same month the House of
     Commons addressed his Majesty in even stronger terms than
       those employed by the House of Peers. " We," they say, " being
      very sensible that the wealth and power of this kingdom do, in a
       great measure, depend on the preserving of the vfoollen manu-
        facture, as much as possible entire to this realm, think it becomes-
        us, like our ancestors, to be jealous of the establishment and in-
       crease thereof elsewhere." . . . "And, therefore, we cannot
      without trouble observe, that Ireland, is dependent on, and pro-
       tected by England in the enjoyment of all they have,"
        " should of late apply itself to the Avoollen manufacture, to the
       great prejudice of the trade of this kingdom [;"] . . . " The
      consequence whereof, vfill necessitate your Parliament of England,
       to inter^DOse to prevent the mischief that threatens us, unless your
       Majesty, by your authority and great wisdom, shall find means to-
       secure the trade of England, by making your subjects in Ireland
       to pursue the joint interest of both kingdoms [;"] and Ave implore
      your Majesty to ["] enjoin all those you employ in Ireland, to make-
         it their care, and use their utmost diligence, to hinder the ex-
       portation of Avool from Ireland, except to be imported hither, and
       for the discouragement of Avoollen manufactures and the en-
       couraging of the linen manufactures in Ireland, to Avhich Ave shall
      always be ready to give our utmost assistance." In compliance
      with the Avishes thus expressed by the Lords and Commons, the

    King communicated with the Irish Parliament, and, on the 27th
     Septeml^er, 1698, in reply to the speech from the throne, the
   Commons of Ireland said[—] " We pray leave to assure your Excel-
     lencies that we shall heartily endeavour to establish a Imen and
   hempen manufacture here, and to render the same useful to Eno-
     land, as Avell as advantageous to this kingdom, and that we hope
     to find such a tempei-ament in respect to the- woollen trade here-
    that the same may not be injurious to England [;"] and forthwith
    they passed a law imposing additional duties ranging from 10 to
    20 per cent, upon all woollen manufactures exported from Ire-
     land, which, says Arthur Young, Q) Avas, in effect, a prohibition.
   The consequence of this compact was that the woollen industry of
    the sister isle shortly perished.
      Having thus got their Irish competitors out of the way, our
    manufacturers once more turned their attention to India. This
    time their efforts were crowned with success, inasmuch as, in
    1700, they persuaded Parliament to pass an act prohibiting the
    import of printed calicoes, under a penalty of £200 on the wearer
    or the seller, but allowing the import of plain calicoes upon the
   payment of a heavy duty, which latter concession was agreed to in
    the interests of the printing industry, which had been established
     since 1676. The protectionists were aided by a number of pam-
    phleteers and public writers of the time, who wrote more or less-
    exaggerated descriptions of the ruin which it was alleged was rapidly
    overtaking our textile industries. Perhaps the most amusing is
    that of Daniel de Foe, the author of ["] Robinson Crusoe." " The
    general fansie of the people (he says) runs upon East India goods
    to that degree that the chints and painted calicoes Avhich before
    were only made use of for carpets, quilts, &c., and to clothe
    children and ordinary people, become now the dress of our ladies [>]
    and such is the power of a mode as we saw our persons of quality
    dressed in Indian carpets, which but a few years before their
    chambermaids would have thought were too ordinary for them."

       ;appear in China and Japan;" moreover, "it crept into our houses,
      our closets and bedchambers [;"] "in short, almost everything that
       used to be made of wool or silk, relating either to the dress of the
     women or the furniture of our houses, was supplied by the Indian
        trade." " Above half of the (woollen) manufacture was entirely
         lost, half of the people scattered and ruined, and all this by the
       intercourse of the East India trade." In a few years it was found
       that although, to please the printers, the imjDort of plain calicoes
      was allowed on the payment of a heavy duty, the demand for
      them was not checked, and in 1712 an excise duty of 3d. per
       yard was levied upon calicoes, printed, stained, painted, or dyed,
      and in 1714 the impost Avas raised to 6d. per yard. These various
        restrictive measures, however, failed to afford the desired protec-
        tion to the wool and silk interests. As Postlethwayt says, in his
      " Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce," the general
      wear of stained or printed India calicoes had occasioned such
              *' unspeakable distress and calamity upon our own manufacturers,
        especially the weavers," that in 1720 an act Avas passed which
        .absolutely prohibited the use or wear of all printed or dyed
        calicoes except muslins, neckcloths, fustians, and fabrics dyed all
        blue. This act, the effect of Avhich Avas to put an end to the
        jjrinting of cloth, either AAdiolly or partly composed of cotton, re-
      mained in force until 1736, in Avhich year it Avas modified so as to
        .sanction the printing of fabrics composed of cotton Aveft and linen
         Avarp, made in imitation of certain styles of East India goods, and
       the production of Avhich had attained considerable importance.
      The prohibition against calicoes pure and simple, however, re"
      mained in force. "The late acts," says the author of a Avork
        entitled ["] A Plan of English Commerce," published in 1728, ["] pro-
        hibiting the use and Avearing of jjainted calicoes either in clothes,
        equipages, or house furniture, Avere Avithout question aimed at
       improving the consumption of our Avoollen manufacture, and in

   The same author is very severe on the ladies of that time for what
    he terms their ungovernable passion for their fashions, the liberty
     of gratifying which, he says, had been frequently injurious to the
    manufactures of England, but he despairs of any reform in the
    matter as, he says, the ladies ["] claim English liberty as well as-
    the men, and as they expect to do what they please and dress
   how they please." The ladies, in fact, were determined to have
     their own way, and, as usual, they were successful.
      The popularity of these goods suggested the obvious de-
     sirability of making a still further approach to the Indian article
   by producing a fabric composed entirely of cotton; but in the
    absence of a inachine capable of turning out a yarn hard and
    strong enough to be used as warp (hitherto supplied by linen),
     this was found to be impossible ; [and][ it][ was][ to][ the][ production][ of]

           bleaching 1774-88.—[Bridgewater][ and][ other][ canals][ opened][ 1780-1790.—]

     The necessity for some [improvement][ in][ the][ method] of spinning

         trade. One good weaver, as Dr. Ure observes, coudd keep

     three active women at woi'k spinning weft ; and, as it was
    found more easy to multiply weavers than spinsters, looms
    were often at a stand for want of yarn. This was especially the
     case after the invention of the fiy-shuttle by Mr. John Kay, of
    Bury, ill 1738, a contrivance Avhich enabled the weaver to turn
    out twice as much cloth as before in a given space of time. "The
    old mode," says Mr. Baines, ["] was, to throw the shuttle with the
    hand, which required a constant extension of the hands to each
     side of the warp. By the new plan the lathe (in which the shuttle
     runs) was lengthened a foot at either end ; and by means of two
     strings attached to the opposite ends of the lathe, and both held
    by a peg in the Aveaver's hand, he, with a slight and sudden pluck,
    was a1:»le to give the proper impulse to the shuttle." The inven-
     tion, however, was adopted very slowly, owing, partly, to the
     jealousy of the workpeople, who opposed this and every other
     labour-saving contrivance, on the ground that it would throw them
    out of employment, and, partly, to the circumstance that the old
    looms were more than able to consume all the yarn that could be
    produced by the existing method of sj^inning. " It was no un-
   common thing," says Mr. Guest, "for a weaver to walk three or
     four miles in a m^orning, and call on five or six spinners, before he
    could collect Aveft to serve him for the remainder of the day" ;
    while in busy times the price paid, including supplementary
     presents made to the spinners to cjuicken their exertions at the
     vfheel, Avas proportionately much higher than the payment re-
     ceived for the cloth Avhen woA'en. Under such circumstances it is
    not surprising that the progress of the manufacture was exceed-
     ingly sloAv; that our spinners and AA^eavers were, in respect of
   many descriptions of yarns and goods, beaten by the cheap pro-
     ducts of India ; and that numerous Avriters of the time took a most
    gloomy A^eAV of the position and prospects of the whole of our
     textile industries. BetAveen 1697 (the earliest year for Avhich we
    have any authentic statistics) and 1749, a period of fifty-tAA'-o years,
     the imports of raAV cotton into the United Kingdom Avere almost
     stationary ; [there][ Avere][ considei-able][ fluctuations,] but the average
     increase Avas quite insignificant. In 1697 and 1701 the imports

       were 1,976,000 lb. and 1,985,000 lb. respectively; during the
       subsequent five years they averaged only 1,170,000 lb., and in
       1710 fell to 715,000 lb. ; in 1720 they rose to 1,972,000 lb., but
          fell to 1,545,0001b in 1730, and to 1,132,0001b in 1743 ; [in] 1748
       they touched the exceptionally large total of 4,853,000 lb., but re-
       ceded to 1,658,0001b. in the following year. The average for the
         five years ended 1747 was only 1,795,000 lb. (4,500 bales of
       400 lb.) or from 180,000 to 190,0001b. less than 1697 and 1701,
       but still about 625,000 lb. (equal 1,560 bales of 400 lb.) greater
       than in 1701— 1705. Meanwhile the import of linen yarn from
       Ireland had increased from 1,538,208 lb. in 1731 to 2,489,872 lb.
        in 1750 ; so that the entire import of raw cotton from all jjarts of
       the world was much less than that of linen yarn from Ireland.
      The cotton was supplied by Turkey and the West Indies, chiefly
       the former, and there never was any difficulty in obtaining quite
        as much as was needed to meet the wants of our spinners. We
       have no record of the price of cotton in those days, but from a
      memorandum written by Mr. Wyatt in 1743 we gather that
      between 1739 and 1743 the prices paid for yarn in London were
          2s. 6d. to 3s. 2d. per lb. for 16's, 3s. 4d. to 3s. 9d. per lb. for
         20's, and 3s. 9d. to 4s. 6d. per lb. for 24's. In the same years
       the average prices of yarn sold by the East Indian Company
       ranged from 3s. 9d. to 7s. 2d. per lb., with a few parcels at from
         8s. Id. to 21s. 2d. per lb. Very little yarn over 24's was
       produced, though 40's were often touched, and 60's were some-
       times "heard of." East Indian yarn as fine as 60's brought 13s.
        to 14s. per lb., and as high as 40s. [per][ lb.] was[ paid][ for] a yarn the
      number of which is not stated. These prices, and those pre-
       viously quoted, were quite sufficient to retard the growth of the
       manufacture, and as they were entirely owing to the high cost of
       production occasioned by the slow and imperfect method of
       spinning then in vogue, it is quite certain that if a vast improve-
      ment had not been made [upon][ the][ one-thread][ wheel, the cotton]
       industry as it now exists would [have][ been][ an][ impossibility.]
       By the one-thread wheel the yarn, says Mr. Baines, ["] was
      spun by two processes, called 'roving ' and ' spinning.' In the

```

```
      first, the spinner took the short fleecy rolls in Avhich the cotton
    was stripped off the hand-cards, applied them successively to the
     spindle, and, whilst with one hand she turned the wheel, and thus
    made the spindle revolve, with the other she drew out the card-
     ings, which, receiving a slight twist from the spindle, were ma(^e
     into thick threads called rovings, and wound upon the spindle so
     as to form cops. In the second process, the roving was spun into
    yarn : the operation was similar, but the thread was dravi'n out
      finer, and received much more twist." The first improvement
    on this primitive wheel was the " spinning Jenny," invented
    by James Hargreaves, a weaver, of Stand-hill, near Blackburn. It
    was brought out in 1764, but was not patented until 1770. The
    idea was suggested by the wheel, and throughout the process the
    operations of the spinner, as described above, were strictly followed.
    The first machine consisted of eight spindles set in a frame, and
    put into motion by a single wheel ; and the action of drawing
    was produced by a movable carriage which contained a horizontal
     clasp through which the rovings passed to the sj^indles. The
     horizontal clasp performed precisely the same operation as the
     finger and thumb of the spinster ; the difference being that eight
    threads were spun at one time instead of only one, while thej
    were also drawn out and twisted more evenly. Subsequently the
    number of spindles was increased to twenty or thirty, and by-
     ancl-by to 120. At first Hargreaves kept the invention to him-
      self, using it merely to produce yarn for his own weaving ; but
    very shortly the secret oozed out, and the spinners in the neigh-
    bourhood, persuaded that the contrivance, if it came to be generally
    adopted, would throw multitudes out of employment, broke into
     his house and destroyed the machine. Hargreaves then (1768)
     retired to Nottingham, where he entered into partnership with [a]
    Mr. Thomas Jones, erected a small mill, and took [out][ a][ patent][ in]
     1770. Before leaving Lancashire, however, he had made[ a] [number]
     of [" ]jennies ["] for sale. In this way the machine soon came into
    such general use that he was unable to maintain[ his][ patent][ right]
    and he died (in 1778) without having received the slightest
    recompense for his valuable invention,

        Some years before Hargreaves brought out the "jenny,"
       which, Hke the domestic wheel, could spin nothing stronger
      than weft, another ingenious mechanic had been at work
      upon a contrivance which, in its final form, turned out
       a thread strong enough for warp, and thereby liberated the
       cotton trade from its dependence upon linen yarn. This
       invention, known as spinning by rollers, was first conceived in
       1730, by John Wyatt, of Birmingham, but was not patented until
       1738, and was not really perfected until taken in hand by Richard
      Arkwright thirty years later. The method adopted was to pass
       the carding or sliver of cotton through two or more pairs of small
        rollers placed horizontally, the upper and lower roller of each pair
       revolving in contact ; and the process, which is exactly the same
        as that in operation in the present day, is thus described by Mr.
       Baines :[—] " The sliver of cotton, being put between the first pair
        of rollers, is by their revolution drawn through and compressed :
       whilst still passing through these rollers, it is caught by another
        pair of rollers placed immediately in front, which revolve with
        three, four, or five times the velocity of the first pair, and which
       therefore ' draw out' the sliver into three, four, or five times its
       former length and degree of fineness. After passing through the
       second pair of rollers, the reduced sliver is attached to a spindle
      and fly, the rapid revolutions of which ' twist ' it into a thread,
      and at the same time wind it upon a bobbin. That the rollers may
       take hold of the cotton, the lower roller is fluted longitudinally,
      and the upper is covered with leather." Though Wyatt was un-
       questionably the first to propound the principle of spinning by
         rollers, both his original machine and that patented in the name
       of Lewis Paul, in 1758, Avere so imperfect in detail that he did
       not succeed in deriving any benefit from his invention. In part-
       nership with Mr. Paul he erected a small mill at Birmingham, in
       1741 or 1742, but the enterprise proved a failure, and the same
        fate befell a second experiment[ a][ year][ or][ two][ later][ at][ Northampton,]
      under the direction of a Mr. Yeoman, with capital supplied by
      Mr. Cave, the proprietor [of] The[ Gentleman's][ Magazine.] It is pretty
        certain that the principle of Wyatt's machine became known to

     Arkwright, and formed the basis of the " spinning-frame," in-
    vented in 1768, and patented in 1769 ; [but][ though][ the][ two][ con-]
     trivances were ahke in principle, they differed materially in form
    and construction, and it was this difference in detail which enabled
    Arkwright to succeed where Wyatt had failed. Much the same
   may also be said in respect of a machine invented by Thomas
     Highs, of Leigh, in 1767, but never practically utilized.
     Like Hargreaves, Arkwright erected his first mill at ISTotting-
    ham, whither he had retired to escape the possibility of
     outrages similar to those inflicted upon Hargreaves, and
     where, after receiving some temporary assistance from Messrs.
     Wright, the bankers, he entered into partnership with Messrs.
    Need and Strutt, and in conjunction with them afterwards (1771)
     built the well-known mill at Cromford, in Derbyshire. It was at
      this mill that the machine was first really perfected, and received
       its name of the " water-frame," owing to the circumstance that
     the mill was turned by water-power.
      With the invention of the " jenny " and the " water-frame ["]
    commenced a new era in the history of the cotton trade ; in
      fact, so far as Europe is concerned, it may be said that the history
      of the cotton manufacture, as a separate and distinct industry,
    began with the invention of these two machines ; for, as we have
     already stated, until the introduction of Arkwright's contrivance
      for spinning by rollers it was impossible to produce a piece of
     cloth composed wholly of cotton; and so insignificant was the
     manufacture as late as 1766 that, in Postlethwayt's "Dictionary
      of Trade and Commerce," brought oat in that year, the only
     reference made to the cotton industry is contained under the
     head of " Linen [;"] and then it is only to report the quantity of
    raw cotton used in connection with the linen industry. How
       little the author thought that the nation was then on the
     threshold of a marvellous industrial revolution may be gathered
     from the tenor of his introdu»ctory [observations][ on][ linen,][ which,]
     he says, "is a commodity of universal use, from the prince
      to the meanest subject, and a commodity that cannot he sup-
     planted by anything else near so commodious and agreeable for

      those uses to which it is applied. The use of the Indian cotton-
      cloth has been often attempted for shirting, but to no purpose ;
     and muslins for women's head-cloths and ruffles, &c., in place of
      cambric, but without success ["] * # u there is found, by long
      experience, to be a substance and firmness in cambric which gives
        it a preference to muslins, for a variety of uses." The fact that
      these remarks were repeated in the fourth edition of the Dic-
      tionary, issued in 1774, showed that the growth of the new
      industry was at first very slow. This was due chiefly to the
      opposition of the workpeople to the improved spinning machinery^
     which was already before the public; but, partly, to the still
     rude method of preparing the raw material for the spinning
      frame. This important process was performed by hand cards,
      " which," says Baines, " were brushes made of short pieces of
      wire instead of bristles, the wires being stuck into a sheet of
      leather at a certain angle, and the leather fastened on a flat piece
      of wood about twelve inches long and five wide, with a handle.
     The cotton being spread upon one of the cards, it was repeatedly
     combed with another, till all the fibres were laid straight, when
        it was stripped off the card in a fleecy roll ready for the rover."
     In 1748 a carding machine to supersede the old hand process
     was brought out by Lewis Paul, of Birmingham, but it was
     not known in Lancashire until 1 760, in which year it was brought
      into operation by Mr. Peel (father of the first Sir Robert)
     but it was so imperfect that it fell into disuse until it was
     improved upon by Mr. John Lees, of Manchester, in 1772; by
     Arkwright in 1773 ; [and][ by][ Wood,][ of][ the][ firm][ of] Wood[ and][ Pil-]
      kington, in 1774. In its final form the machine turned off the
      cotton in an endless fleecy roll fully prepared for the next process.
     In 1775 Arkwright took out a patent including these and various
      other improvements connected Avith carding, drawing, roving, and
      spinning : combining, in fact, every machine comprised in the
      Imsiness of cotton spinning. His pretensions were fiercely
     opposed by other inventors and by his rivals in the trade, who
      infringed his patents without the slightest compunction. This
       state of things forced him to institute legal proceedings for the

     maintenance of his rights. In the first trial (1781) a verdict was
     given against him, chiefly on the ground that the specification
      given on obtaining his patent was obscure and unintelligible.
     Four years later, however, he Avas more successful, a verdict being
      given in his favour on the 17th of February, 1785. This un-
      looked-for result created considerable alarm amongst the manu-
      facturers of Lancashire, many of whom, on the strength of the
      verdict of 1781, had expended a large amount of capital in
      the erection of Arkwright machines ; [and][ steps] were immediately
     taken to obtain a cancelment of the second decision. The case
     came on in June, 1785, and on the 25th of that month the jury
     gave a verdict which in effect nullified the whole of Arkwright's
      patents, and threw them open to the world.
        That Arkwright Avas a great genius, and that he Avas the
      inventor of several imjjortant processes connected Avith modern
      cotton-spinning, that he was, to all intents and purposes, the
      father of the modern cotton manufacture, cannot be doubted
     but it Avas made abundantly clear at the trial of 1785 that he
      laid claim to more than really belonged to him ; and so satisfied
     was the judge on this point that he peremptorily refused to grant
     a neAV trial, remarking that he Avas convinced that " the de-
     fendant had not a leg to stand upon." But Arkwright, unlike
      Hargreaves, Avas a man of indomitable energy and remarkable
      business capacity ; hence, even before his patents were thrown
     open to the public, he had succeeded in amassing considerable
      wealth. Shortly after his first patent the jealousy of the Lan-
      cashire manufacturers against him was so gTeat that they refused
      to purchase his yarn, the result of which was that a heavy and
      valuable stock accumulated at the mill. But the man Avho
      Avorked from five o'clock in the morning until nine at night, and
      Avho, Avhen he Avas considerably more than fifty years of age,
     commenced the study of English grammar, and devoted an hour a
     day to improve his writing and orthography, was not the man to
     be disconcerted by a check movement of this kind. He at once
     commenced to weave his own yarn, and in this Avay met his
      -opponents in a manner they little anticipated. He Avas in part-

      nership with Messrs. Need and Strutt at this time, but he was
       the ruling spirit of the firm, and his partners promptly fell in
      with his suggestions. As manufacturers their first trial was
       in weaving stockings, but the [transition] from stockings to cloth
      was soon made, and in 1773 was produced the first piece of
      British-made calico. Orders for goods now flowed in from all
       quarters, and everything was apparently [going] on [prosperously]
     when suddenly and unexpectedly the whole[ of] the [orders][ in][ hand]
      were countermanded : the discovery having been made that the
      goods being all cotton were liable to an excise duty of sixpence
      per yard (instead of threepence, which was the duty on mixed
        fabrics), while their use when printed was prohibited ! These
       duties were directed against Indian [calicoes,][ for][ the][ protection][ of]
       the home trade : no one, at the time (1736) when the Act em-
      bodying them was passed, contemplating[ the] possibility of goods
         all cotton being produced in England. To overcome this new
        difficulty Arkwright and his partners applied to [the][ Excise][ for] a
       remission of the duties, and as this was refused an appeal was
     made (at great expense) to Parliament, the upshot[ of] which was
       the passage of an Act the preamble of which [states][ that][ "][ whereas]
       a new manufacture of stufi^s wholly made of cotton wool hath
      been set up within this kingdom, &c., be it enacted that no
       higher duty than threepence for every yard in length reckoning
      yard wide, shall be imposed, &c., and that it shall be lawful
       for any person to wear any new manufacture made wholly of
       cotton when manufactured[ ;"] and[ this] Act, be it observed, was
       obtained against the " strong opposition of the manufacturers in
       Lancashire ! " who were annoyed by the circumstance that
      Arkwright had the start of them in capital, prestige, and ex-
       perience : a motive as spiteful and [contemptible] as it was selfish
      and suicidal. Q)
        While this struggle between Arkwright and his various
      opponents was going on, the workpeople of Lancashire were

       same year received the well-deserved honour [of][ Knighthood.] He died in

     doing all in their power to strangle the rising industry. From
     time to time there had been minor local demonstrations made
     against the new machines, but in 1779 there was a much more
      serious rising in, and for several miles round, Blackburn ; and
     every ["] jenny ["] made on Hargreaves' principal containing moi'e
     than twenty spindles was destroyed. Those with twenty spindles
     were considered useful, and were therefore spared,—a fact which
    showed that knowledge had at least gained some ground, seeing
     that ten years previously a machine with only eight spindles
    was considered dangerous to the interests of the workpeople.
     Arkwright's water-frame was of such a nature that it could not be
    worked with profit, except with considerable power, and it had
      not, therefore, spread so rapidly as Hargreaves' jenny, which
     could be worked at the homes of the operatives. Arkwright,
     however, did not escape, for a mill of his, says Mr. Baines, erected
      at Bickacre, near Chorley, was destroyed by a mob " in the
     presence of a powerful body of police and military, without any of
     the civil authorities requiring their interference to prevent the
     outrage." The opposition of the better classes was quite as great
      as that of the workpeople against the new machinery. " Not per-
     ceiving the tendency of any invention which imj)roved and
     cheapened the manufacture, to cause an extended demand for its
     products, and thereby to give employment to more hands than it
     superseded, those classes were alarmed lest the poor-rates should be
     burdened with workmen thrown idle. They, therefore, connived
       at, and even actually joined in, the opposition to machinery, and
     did all in their power to screen the rioters from punishment." (^)
      It was these constant disturbances that caused the Legislature in
     1782 to pass an Act making the destruction of cotton and other
      textile machinery a capital felony. But at the very time when
     popular vengeance was being visited upon Hargreaves' machine,
     another contrivance, which was destined to supersede the "jenny"
      as effectually as the "jenny" had superseded the "spinning-
     wheel," was being constructed by Samuel Crompton, a weaver, of
          (^) " History of the Cotton Manufacture," by Edward Baines, p. 160.

       " Hall-in-the-Wood," near Bolton. This machine was first de-
       signed in 1774, but was not comi^leted until 1779. It was called
       a ["] mule," and received its name from the circumstance that it
      combined the principles of both Hargreaves' jenny and Arkwright's
       water-frame. Its main advantage consisted in the fact that a
        finer and more uniform yarn could be produced Avith it than was
        possible with either of the other machines, and on this account it
      was sometimes called the muslin-wheel : the first English muslin,
       properly so called, being woven from yarn spun by the ["] mule."
      Crompton did not take out a patent for his invention, and the
       only recompence he received was a parliamentary grant of £5,000,
      made in 1812 : thirtj^-three years after he had given the fruit of
        his genius to the world ! Important improvements have been
      made in the details of both Arkwright's and Crompton's machines,
      but the principles of the ["] water-frame ["] and the "mule ["] remain
        to the present day the same as when they left the hands of
        their inventors.
         There was now no longer any anxiety respecting the supply
       of yarn ; [on][ the][ contrary,][ the][ fear] was exjDressed that [" ]so many
        mills would be erected, and so much cotton spun, that hands
       could never be found to weave it." This apprehension arose from
       the circumstance that whereas the art of cotton-sjiinning had been
       completely revolutionised, and the power of producing yarn almost
        indefinitely extended, the art of weaving, and the capacity for
      consuming yarn, had remained pretty nearly at a standstill. The
       only improvements made up to 1785 were the invention of the
       " fly-shuttle," by John Kay, in 1738, which doubled the jiroducing
      power of the handloom ; [and][ the][ invention][ of][ the][ "][ drop-box,"] by
      Eobert Kay (son of John), in 1760, which enabled the weaver to
       use at pleasure "any one of three shuttles, each containing
       different-coloured weft, without the trouble of taking them from
      and replacing them in the lathe." In 1785, however, the Rev.
       Dr. Cartwright invented a power-loom, which, as Baines says,
     may be regarded as the parent of that now in use. Writing to
      Mr. Bannatyne, editor of the " Encyclopaedia Britannica," Dr.
       Cartwright said,[—] " Happening to be at Matlock in the summer

     of 1784 I fell in company with some gentlemen [of] Manchester,
    when the conversation turned [on][ Arkwright's][ spinning][ machinery.]
    One of the company observed[ that][ as][ soon][ as][ Arkwright's][ patent]
     expired, so many mills would be erected, and so much cotton
     spun, that hands never could be found to weave it. To this
     observation I replied, that Arkwright must then set his wits to
    work to invent a weaving mill. This brought on a conversation
    on the subject, in which [the] [Manchester][ gentlemen][ unanimously]
     agreed that the thing was impracticable, and in defence of their
     opinion, they adduced arguments which I certainly was incom-
     petent to answer, or even to comprehend, being totally ignorant
     of the subject, having never at that time seen a person weave ;
      I controverted, however, the impracticability of [the][ thing] by[ re-]
    marking that there lately had been exhibited in London an
    automaton figure which played at chess. Now you will not
     assert, gentlemen, said I, that it is more difficult to construct a
    machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the
     variety of moves which are required in that complicated game.
    Some little time afterwards a particular circumstance recalling
      this conversation to my mind, it struck me that as in [plain][ weaving,]
     a,ccording to the conception I then had of the business, there
     could only be three movements which were to follovf [each][ other][ in]
     succession, there would be little difficulty in producing and re-
     peating them. Full of these ideas I immediately employed a
     carpenter and smith to carry them into effect. As soon as the
    machine was finished, I got a weaver to put in the warp, which
    was of such materials as sailcloth is usually made of. To my
     great delight, a piece of cloth, such as it was, was the produce.
    As I had never before tui-ned my thoughts to anything me-
      chanical, either in theory or practice, nor had ever seen [a] loom[ at]
     work, or knew anything of its construction, you will readily
     .suppose my first loom was a most rude piece of [machinery.] The
    warp was placed perpendicularly, the reed[ fell] with[ the] [weight][ of]
      at least half-a-hundred weight, and the springs which threw the
     shuttle were strong enough to have thrown a Congreve rocket.
     In short, it required the strength of two powerful men to work

       the machine at a slow rate, and only for a short time. Conceiv-
        ing, in my great simplicity, that I ha<l accomplished all that was
        required, I then secured what I thought was a most valuable pro-
        perty, by a patent, 4th April, 1785. This being done, I then
       condescended to see how other people wove ; and you will guess
     my astonishment when I compared their easy modes of operation
       with mine. Availing myself, however, of what I then saw, I
      made a loom, in its general principles nearly as they are now
       made. But it was not till the year 1787 that I completed my
       invention, when I took out my last weaving patent, August 1st
        of that year." The improved loom, however, was still defective;,
      and Dr. Cartwright expended the whole of a handsome private
       fortune in endeavours to perfect the machine, but without suc-
         cess. Similarly unsuccessful were the improvements brought
       out by Mr. Bell, of Glasgow, in 1794, and by Mr. Miller,
        of Glasgow, in 1796; and only a modified success was achieved
      by Mr. Monteith, of Glasgow, who took out a patent in
       1801. "The great obstacle to the success of the power-loom,"
       says Baines, ["] was, that it was necessary to stop the machine
        frequently, in order to dress the warp as it unrolled from the
       beam, which operation required a man to be employed for each
       loom, so that there was no saving of labour." This and other
      minor defects, however, were removed by the various dressing
       machines and other contrivances brought out by Messrs. Kadclifie
      and Koss, of StockjDort, in the name of Thomas Johnson, a weaver,
        in their employment, and by Mr. Horrocks and Mr. Peter
       Marsland, manufacturers, of the same town, between the
       years 1802 and 1813, since which date very little change has
       been made in the method of constructing the power-loom,
       though in matters of detail some very imjDortant improvements
       have been introduced. In 1809 the case of Dr. Cartwright was
       brought before Parliament, and he was fortunate enough [to][ obtain]
        a grant of £10,000 as a reward for his part in aiding [the][ progress]
        of the cotton manufacture. The power-loom, owing to the [defects]
        to which we have just alluded, came into general use far more
       slowly than the ["] water-f]:ame ["] and the ["] mule[ ;"] and hand-loom

    weaving was an extensive branch of the cotton industiy more
    than half a century after the last spinning-wheel had disappeared.
       Simultaneously with the rapid advancement in the arts of
    spinning and weaving, considerable progress was also made in
     several departments of industry closely connected with the cotton
    manufacture. Cylinder printing, invented by Bell, of Glasgow,
     in 1 783, and by means of which one man and a boy were capable
     of doing as much work as 100 block printers and as many boys,
    was introduced into Lancashire in 1785, by Livesey, Hargreaves,
     Hall, and Co. Oxymuriatic acid, or chlorine, discovered by Scheele,
    the Swedish philosopher, in 1774, was applied to bleaching by
     Berthollet, the French chemist, in 1785, introduced into GlasgoAv
    by Watt, the chemist, in 1786, and into Manchester by Mr.
    Thomas Henry, in 1788. By this application the time occupied
     in bleaching was reduced to a few days, whereas it had previously
    taken up several months. Watt, the engineer, took out his first
    patent for improvements in the steam engine in 1769, followed
    by other patents in 1781, 1782, and 1784. The first engine made
     for a cotton mill was erected by Watt and his partner Boulton, in
     1785, for Messrs. Eobinson, of Paplewick, in Nottinghamshire.
   A second one was put up for Mr. Drinkwater, in Manchester, in
     1789, a third was constructed for Sir Richard Arkwright, at Not-
    tingham, in 1790, and a fourth for Messrs. Scott and Stevenson,
     at Glasgow, in 1792. Meanwhile a considerable impetus had
    been given to trade in general by the opening of the Bridgewater
    and other canals between 1760 and 1790. During this period the
    shipping cleared out of English poi-ts rose from 471,000 to
    1,379,000 tons ; [and][ no][ doubt][ the][ increase][ in][ the][ internal][ move-]
    ments of trade was quite as great in proportion. This rapid
    development of consuming power greatly cheapened the cost of
    producing all kinds of cotton goods, and led to such an increased
    demand for the raw material that grave apprehensions were enter-
     tained as to whether a sufficient supply of the fibre could be
    obtained to meet the constantly increasing requirements of the
     rapidly rising manufacture. Hitherto the chief sources of supply
    had been the West Indies and Turkey, and as early as 1780 the

        British Government, with the view to meeting the wants of
        Lancashire, levied a duty of l:|d. per lb. and 5 per cent, upon
        cotton imported in foreign ships, the "proceeds to be devoted to the
       encouragement of the growth of cotton in his Majesty's Leeward
        Islands, and for encouraging the import thereof into Great Britain."
      Our spinners,, however, were quite convinced that neither the
      West Indies nor the dominions of Turkey would be able to
        furnish them with all the cotton they wanted ; and in 1788 they
       urged the East India Company to j^ush the cultivation of cotton
        in the territories under their jurisdiction ; very naturally
       supposing that if an increased supply of cotton could be
       obtained from any quarter whatever, it would be from the
       country which was undoubtedly the cradle of the cotton
       manufacture. But within a very few years assistance came
       from a totally unexpected quarter—the Southern States of
        the American Union, where, owing to the invention of the
        saw-gin by Eli Whitney, the cultivation of the plant made such
       extraordinary progress that West India and Turkey cottons
       were rapidly superseded, and the desired supply from India ren-
       dered unnecessary.
         About the year 1720 an Act was passed which inflicted a fine
         of £100, or three months' imprisonment, upon any person who
       endeavoured to entice any manufacturer or artificer out of his
        Majesty's dominions ; [but][ as,][ in][ spite] of these penalties, ["] divers
       wicked persons ["] had seduced into [foreign] ports [several][ artificers][ in]
        the woollen and other m_anufactures, the fine was in 1750 raised
        to £500, and the imprisonment to twelve months for the first
         offence, and to £1,000 and two years, respectively, for the second
         offence. By the same Act the export of machinery was pro-
        hibited by the forfeiture of the goods and a fine of £200.
       In 1782 this Act was extended to the calico printing and
        cotton branches of manufacture. "In 1785 a German named
      Boden Avas tried at Lancaster and fined £500 for having
         visited Manchester and enticed cotton operatives to Germany,
       and in the succeeding year another person was fined £200 for
       having in his possession a quantity of cotton machinery with a

          CHAPTER III.
      PROGRESS OF INVENTION SINCE 1800 : DESCRIPTION OF A
             MODERN COTTON MILL.
        Chief Mechanical Appliances upon which Modern Cotton Industry is based,
              all brought out in short period between 1769 and 1793. —Subsequent
         Improvements merely developments of principles evolved in that
           period.—First great improvement—Roberts' "Self-acting Mule,"
            1825-30.[—] "Throstle," based on "Water-frame," brought out about
         same time. —Improvements in Weaving much slower than in Spinning,
     —Large sums of money lost by Dr. Cartwright and others in efforts to
          improve Power-loom.—Only 2,400 Power-looms in existence in 1813.—
         Machine strongly opposed by Work-people.—First successful Improve-
         ments by Sharp and Roberts, 1822, but Hand-loom still in the
          ascendant as late as 1833 ; and Power-loom did not take lead until
            after improvements made by Bullough in 1841.—Both Spinning and
         Weaving Machines were now almost automatic. —Subsequent improve-
          ments directed to the securing of smoother action, increased out-turn,
         and diminished cost of production.—Great increase in length and speed
            of Mules, and speed of Looms compared with fifty years ago.
         The Ring-Throstle. — The Mule-Throstle. — Improvements in Pre-

     The most remarkable circumstance connected with the history of
       the cotton industry is the fact that, as shoAvn in our second chapter,
       nearly the whole of the mechanical inventions and discoveries upon
      which the manufacture of the present day is based, were made
      known to the world within the short space of about a quarter of
       a century, commencing in 1769 with Arkwright's[ first] patent, and

    ending in 1793 with "Whitney's saw-gin; the various contrivances,
    moreover, following each other in the natural sequence of demand
   and supply : improved spinning leading to improved weaving,
    and both together necessitating an increased supply of cotton,
    which would not have been obtained but for the invention of the
    saw-gin. But though the mechanical principles of modern cotton
    spinning and weaving were brought into operation during the
    period named, they were, from our present stand-point, onl}- very
    imperfectly carried out. The domestic wheel had disappeared,
    but much hand-labour was still necessary to work the new sijinning
    machines ; while in respect of weaving, the hand-loom continued
     to hold its own, owing to the yet unsurmounted difficulties in the
   way of the profitable working of the power-loom. The automatic
    character of Arkwright's water-frame rendered its proprietor
    almost independent of what may be termed "skilled labour," the
    hands employed in the spinning process being chiefly young
    people ; but the "mule ["] could not be worked without the aid
     of a skilled operative, called a " spinner," whose duty it was to
    superintend the general operation of the machine, and upon whose
    good conduct depended the employment of the hands engaged in
    the various subordinate departments. The rapidly extended use
     of the " mule ["] in the absence of a corresponding increase in
    the supply of "spinners," soon led to disagreements between the
   men and their employers, and the former were at times so unre-
     liable and overbearing that it became quite evident that the
    progress of the trade would be retarded unless the "mule ["] could
    be made as automatic as the "water-frame." The first attempt
     to meet this urgent want of the trade is said to have been made
    sometime before 1790 by Mr. WilHam Strutt, son of Arkwright's
     partner, but, from some cause or other not recorded, the in-
    vention was unsuccessful. A self-acting mule, invented by Mr.
     Kelly, of Lanark Mills, in 1792, likewise lacked the elements of
     success ; as did also several other contrivances brought out during
    the first quarter of the present century. But ultimately every
     difficulty was overcome by Mr. Roberts (Messrs. Sharpe and Roberts,
    machine-makers, of Manchester), who in 1825 patented the now

```
       celebrated ["] self-acting mule," and in 1830 brought out a still more
       perfect machine. By this invention the attendance of the capricious
       spinner was dispensed with, while a greater quantity of yarn was
       produced. Moreover, as Mr. Baines observes, the new machine
       turned out a yarn more uniform in twist, and less liable to break,
      and wound it upon the cop more evenly and closely, and, therefore,
      more desirable for the weaver. About the same time that Roberts
      brought out his "self-acting mule," a very important improve-
      ment was made in the " water-frame," whereby the quality of
       the yarn spun was improved, the quantity produced increased,
      and the. cost of production diminished. The new machine was
        called the "Throstle," and until its invention mule-spinning
      had made such rapid progress producing both warp and weft
           —
        that, comparatively speaking, the "water-frame" appeared to be
       going out of use, but the invention of the " Throstle " rein-
       vigorated the apparently declining art of spinning on Arkwright's
        princijile, especially as the application of steam-power to weaAdng
        called for a warp stronger and more wiry than the "mule" could
       produce. Since the invention of the "self-acting" mule and the
       "Throstle" quite a multitude of minor improvements in spinning-
      have been patented, the general effect of which has been a
       materially increased out-turn of yarn in a given space of time, at
       a considerably reduced cost of production. At the opening of the
       present century the number of spindles in the mule averaged
      about 200 ; fifty years ago they mostly ranged from 300 to 350,
      though a few with from 500 to 600 were in existence ; at present
      they probably do not average less than 750 ; [while][ in][ the] most
       recently constructed mills they range from 1,000 to 1,200.
      Simultaneously with the augmented length of the mules their
      speed has also been greatly increased ; [while][ the][ better][ working,]
       arising out of the various improvements introduced from time to
       time, has enabled the operative spinner to take in charge a con-
       stantly increased number of spindles Ten years ago. Dr. Bridges
      and Mr. Holmes, in their report to the Local Government Boar<l,
       said that it appeared " to be safe to say that the number of
       spindles to each hand in the mule spinning room has increased

```

```
   between threefold and fourfold during the last forty years," and
    there can be no doubt that a further increase has taken place
    since the report was issued.
     The ["] Mule ["] has all along been in more general use than the
    " Throstle." The reasons for this are stated very clearly by Mr.
   James Hyde in his ["] Science of Cotton Spinning." " In the first
    place, the cops will hold about three times the quantity of yarn
   contained on a throstle-bobbin^ which will give less labour to the
    Avinder ; and of course there will be considerably less time lost in
    doffing the cops off the mule than in doffing the bobbins from the
    throstle ; and as respects the power required for the two methods
    of spinning, it will be at least two to one in favour of the mule ;
    the same with respect to the quantity of oil used. The difference
    in carriage between cops and bobbins will be in something like
    the same proportion. The wear-and-tear of throstle-bobbins is no
    small item in the monthly bill, while mules have no such bills to
    provide for ; and I think if we investigate the question of wages,
    or the immediate cost of the two methods of spinning of the same
    counts of yarn, that likewise will be in favour of spinning water
    twist by mules. Suppose we take a pair of self-acting mules of
    80 dozen spindles each, we then have 1,920 spindles, with one
   minder at 30s. per Aveek, one piecer at 15s. per Aveek, and one
    setter-in and scavenger at 8s. per week— 53s. per Aveek. Then
    1,920 spindles revolving 7,000 times per minute Avill produce
    1,673 lb. of 36's water twist per week[ of] 58 [hours] ; but it will
    require 2,686 throstle-spindles, revolving 5,000 [times][ per][ minute,]
    to produce the same quantity of yam, and[ will][ require][ nine] good
    piecers to attend to 300 spindles each, at lOs. per week. If we
    rate the proportionate cost of [doffing][ for][ that][ number][ of][ spindles]
    at 10s. per week, which is very [moderate,] we[ shall][ have][ the] sum
    of £5 to pay as wages on the [cost][ of][ spinning][ 1,673][ lb.][ of][ throstle-]
    yarn or water-twist [;] Avhereas, by self-acting mules we have the
   same Aveight and counts of yarn [produced][ for][ the][ sum][ of][ =£2] 1 3s.
    so by this it is clear there is a saving, in favour of self-acting
    mules of something like £2 7s. per Aveek, or nearly one-half."
   But this superior position [of][ the] " mule " is just now being very

         seriously threatened by some remarkable changes which have of
          late been made in the construction of the ["] Throstle : ["] based as a
         starting point on the American invention known as the ring and
         traveller-spinning frame. Varieties of this machine have for a
       number of years been in use in the United States, but it is only
         quite recently that the invention has gained a foothold in Lanca-
          shire, and this is due to important improvements on the original
         design. The new machine takes up little more than half the
         space occupied by the "mule," while its spindles can be run at
         quite as high a speed. As an example of what can be done, it
      may be stated that the result of a test made a short time ago
       showed that while the average production of 3,592 mule spindles
       was for ten weeks only 13-07 ounces per spindle per week, that
          of 6,560 Rabbeth Ring Spindles, occupying the same floor space
          as the 3,592 mule spindles, was for the same period 17^ ounces
        per spindle per week. In each case the yarn spun was 29|'s full
         counts. Another, and still more remarkable machine, is the
         " Mule-Throstle," recently patented by Mr. William Lancaster,
         of Accrington, and by [which][ both][ weft][ and][ twist][ cops] are spun
       on the bare spindle^ same as by the self-acting mule. The new
        machine is the most important invention since the production of
        the original " Throstle," and if it should come into general use
        (about which there[ is][ as][ yet] [some][ difference] of opinion amongst
         practical spinners) [it] [will] very[ materially] cheapen[ the][ cost][ of] pro-
        ducing both weft and[ warp.] Moreover, it will enable the busi-
         ness of cotton spinning to be, successfully carried on in much
         smaller mills than [are] now[ absolutely][ required] by[ the][ latest] make
                                       ^
          of self-acting [mule.(^)]
                 (^) In reference to [the] qiiestion of Mule-yarn versus Throstle-yarn, a
          correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, [writmg][ at][ the] commencement
           of 18S.3, said : ["] During the past year or two a change in the use of warps
           for cotton cloth manufactures has been going on in different parts of
          Lancashire. In some towns, notably Burnley, hardly any warps used to
         be consumed [but][ those][ made][ from] ' throstle ' yarns ; at the present time
          these are the [exception,][ for][ it][ has][ been][ found][ that] ' mule ' twist is cheaper,
         and makes [quite][ as][ good] cloth. This change has necessitated alterations
         werein the commonly process[ of] [manufacture.]called ' ball warps,Throstle' and warps had consequently were warped to in balls be ' sized; they'
         on ' ball ' machines. Mule warps, however, are manipulated in quite a
           different way and at a[ less][ cost.] Tlais kind of yarn, mostly spun in Oldham

      As explained in the previous chapter, the power-loom
    came into general use far more slowly than either the water-
    frame or the mule. Even after the improved dressing or sizing,
    machine brought out by Messrs. RadclifFe and Ross in 1804, and
     after the improvements made in the loom itself by Mr. H.
    Horrocks and others about the same time, the progress of
    power-loom weaving was so slow that in 1813, twenty-nine years
     after the date of Dr. Cartwright's* invention, there were only
    2,400 power-looms and 100 dressing machines in use in the
    United Kingdom, whereas the number of hand-looms at work
    probably exceeded 200,000. Meanwhile, the progress of mule
    spinning had been so rapid that from 4,000,000 to 5,000,000
     spindles on Crompton's principle were in operation in 1812.
     Sufficient had been done, however, to alarm the hand-loom
    weavers ; and in 1813 mobs rose in various parts of the countr}',
    and broke all the new machines within the range of their des-
     tructive oj)erations ; the introduction of the power-loom being
    blamed for the distress occasioned by the American War and the
    Orders in Council. Horrocks's most important improvements
    were patented in 1813, but, this notwithstanding, only about
    11,750 power-looms were put up between that year and
     1820. In 1822 Messrs. Sharp and Eoberts brought out a
    loom based chiefly on the patent registered by Horrocks nine
     years before, and arranged for the production of fustians, velvets,
     &c. This machine at once became popular, and may be said to
    and Ashton, is offered for sale in the cop, and the manufacturer has to
     wind, beam, and tape it before it is fit for the loom. The taping is in place
      of the ' sizing ' of ' ball warps. ' Another feature in the matter is that with
     throstle-yarn sizing flour was used in the preparation, but farina is now
    commonly used for taping printers. In manufacturing printers very little
      size is used ; indeed, it may safely be stated that there is put on the yarn
      just sufficient for weaving purposes. In Todmorden, Over Darwen, and
    Hebden Bridge the same change is at work for Mexicans, and though
     considerably more size is put on the yarn for this make of cloth, the
    new process is on the whole satisfactory. The fact is that competition
       is so keen that every effort has to be put forth by manufacturers to
     reduce cost. This change from throstle to mule yarn will in some part
     account for the bad trade throstle spinners have had during the past few
      years. Old mills in Burnley, Rossendale, and Rochdale have had to close,
     whilst Oldham and the surrounding districts have developed their mule-
     yarn connection."

       have marked the real starting-point of modem power-loom weaving.
     A large number of the new machines were put up in 1823, and a still
        greater number in 1824 and 1825, during which years the specu-
         lative mania, which ran through every department of business,
       showed itself in the manufacturing districts in the form of a rage
         for mill building. In 1826 came a check : the consumption of cotton
           fell from from 11,500 bales per week to 9,800 bales, the average
         price of middling American declined from llfd. to 6|d. per lb.,
       and the annual exports of manufactured goods receded from 336
         million yards to 267 millions. The result was a temporary period
         of distress amongst the operatives, and another rising of hand-
       loom weavers against the increased use of the power-loom : ending
         in the destruction of a great number of the newly-erected machines.
       Comparatively little building went on between 1826 and 1831 ;
       but 1832 and 1833 witnessed renewed activity, and in the last-
      named year it was estimated that from "100,000 to 105,000
       power-looms were in operation in Great Britain against only
        14,150 in 1820; but although in the thirteen years from 85,000
         to 90,000 autom^atic looms had been put up, the number of hand-
       looms at work had been increased to 250,000 from 240,000.
     Down to 1833, therefore, the hand-loom had by no means been
       superseded by its powerful rival. The fact is that the power-loom
         Avas still defective in detail : so defective, indeed, that the improve-
       ments since made have trebled its productive power. In almost
       every year after the appearance of Roberts's first loom patents
         for improvements, of more or less importance, in some one of the
        various portions of the loom, were taken out in this country or
        the United States ; but the first really valuable invention, or, at
          all events, the one which has best s^ood the test of experience,
         v/as that registered by Messrs. Kenworthy and Bullough, of Black-
        burn, in 1841. This improved power-loom (mainly the invention
        of Mr. Bullough), said the late Alderman Baynes in 1857, " with
         its self-acting temple, stop, and taking-up motion, reduced the
        labour of the weaver nearly one half, and produced a greater
       quantity of a decidedly richer and superior quality of cloth,
       which admirably adapted it for the Eastern markets, whither so

```

-----

```
     large a quantity is now exported in the grey state." Before the
     invention of the self-acting temple (an apparatus attached to looms
     for the purpose of keeping the cloth as it is woven distended to
      its full width) the movement had to be constantly superintended
    by an operative ; but by Mr. Bullough's contrivance this expense
    was saved, while the power-loom became really automatic. Subse-
    quently Mr. Kenworthy invented an improved jjower-warping
      mill, which, as Mr. Alderman Baynes observed, considerably
    reduced the labour of the warper, and yet produced one-third
    more work. Further improvements have since been made by
     quite a host of inventors, the general result of which has been, as
     in the case of the improvements in the machinery for spinning, to
     secure smoother action, increased out-turn, and diminished cost of
     production. Fifty years ago the speed of the loom varied fron-
    90 to 112 picks (throws of the shuttle) a minute; ten years since
      it was estimated at from 170 to 200 picks per minute ; (^) since
    which there has been a still further increase. At the late Exhi-
     bition of Machinery at Oldham there was shown a light calico
     loom, capable of running as high as 400 picks per minute. One
    important result of the improvements just noticed is that the
    weaver can now take charge of more looms than was previously
     possible. Forty years ago, few operatives, with the usual juvenile
     assistance, could manage more than two looms, whereas a good
    hand can now take charge of from four to six looms.
       Simultaneously with the constant improvements being made
     in the machinery for spinning and weaving, quite as important
     changes have been introduced from time to time into the prepara-
     tory processes of willowing, scutching, lapping, and carding.
     Before the invention of the scutching machine by Mr. Snodgrass, of
    Glasgow, in 1797, the raw cotton, says Mr. Baines, "was opened
    and cleansed by being placed upon cords stretched on a wooden
     frame, and then beaten by women with smooth switches ["]—an
    employment not only very fatiguing, but one looked uj)on as
     exceedingly degrading. The scutching machine not only relieved
                 (^) Report by Dr. J. H. Bridges and Mr. Holmes.

       the " hands " of this dirty occiiiiation, but it did the work a
        great deal better and at one-twentieth of the cost. The machine
       was not introduced into Lancashire until about 1808 or 1809, but
       was in course of time generally adopted, and has since been greatly
       improved upon—the most notable recent developments being the
        various patents associated with the names of .Mr. Edward Lord
       and Messrs. Crighton and Sons. Very important improvements
       have also taken place in cardmaking and in the construction of
        carding engines : commencing with the mechanical card-stripper,
       patented by Mr. Alexander Buchanan (of Findlay and Co., Ayr-

       brought out by Mr. James Smith (Deanstone Cotton Works) in
        1834, and ending with the various [inventions] [and][ improvements]
       brought out by Mr. Evan Leigh in 1850 and subsequent years;
        the general result being a vastly increased [productive] [power] at
       an immensely reduced cost. Similar economising progress has [also]
       been going forward in the printing and [bleaching] [departments][ of][ the]
        industry. Nor has the comfort of the operatives been[ overlooked.]
       Improved machinery has banished the stifling [clouds][ of][ dust][ and]
          fly which formerly filled the air of the blowing-room, [and][ only][ in]
         a less degree contaminated the atmosphere [of][ the] [carding-room] ;
        while in all modern-built mills every room has been made
        healthier and pleasanter to work in : loftier, better ventilated, and
         lighter.
         The best constructed modern [spinning] mills are erected on
        the fire-proof principle. The external walls are substantially
         built of brick and stone. The buildings vary from five [to][ seven]
         stories in height, and are of [sufficient][ length][ and][ width][ to][ accom-]
       modate self-acting mules of at least 1,000 [spindles twist][ guage,][ or]
        1,200 spindles weft guage. The beams and pillars are made of
         cast iron, and the joists or [girders][ of][ rolled][ iron.] The ceilings of
        each room consist of small arches between[ the][ joists,][ levelled][ up]
       with concrete and made into one [solid][ mass,][ affording][ a][ substantial]
         flooring for the room above, which flooring is generally boarded
         over. The mixing room, the [scutching] [room,][ and][ the card][ room]
        are mostly on the ground floor or bottom stories ; [the][ spinning]

    rooms are in the upper stories. The warehouse, boiler-house, and
    engine-house ai-e on the ground floor adjoining the mill proper.
   At the present time a good, substantial, fire-proof mill can be
    erected and fitted with the best machinery at a cost of 20s. per
     spindle, weft and twist. There are many mills in Oldham which
     cost from 26s. to 34s. per spindle, but they were constructed at a
    time when building materials, machinery, and labour were very
    high in price.
     On the arrival of the cotton at the mill the bales are weighed
    and examined, in order to ascertain that the weights are in
    accordance with the invoice, and that the quality is equal to the
    purchase sample, or to the " class " guaranteed in the contract.
   Any bales that do not comply with these conditions are put aside
     until the sellers have been communicated with ; [the][ remainder,]
     after being stripped of their bands and tares, are opened out in
    the mixing room. The cotton, which in the bale is very closely
    compressed for the purpose of carriage from the countries of
    growth, is pulled into small pieces, about the size of those shewn
     in the selling samples in Liverpool. These pieces are sj)read out
     in layers one over another until a large heap or stack has been
    formed, called a mixing, consisting it may be of various parcels
     of cotton very similar in quality. In the best conducted mills
    the practice is for the longer stapled cotton to be put into one
    mixing, and the shorter stapled into another ; and a similar rule
      is observed in respect of very clean and yevy dirty cotton ; there
    are separate mixings, too, for stained and white cotton. The reason
     for this is, that the blending of the various sorts and qualities can
    be more evenly accomplished at a later stage of the operations
    than in the "mixing."
      The first machine through which the "mixing" is passed (called
    a "willow," or "opener") is one in which the cotton is thoroughly
    beaten and opened out, in which, in fact, it is restored from the
    more or less matted condition caused by the compression incidental
     to packing, to the soft and fluffy state in which it existed after
    ginning and before baling. This process, while loosening the fibres,
     also serves to shake out much of the soil, dust, leaf, and other

```

                        40
       extraneous substances with which the bulk of the cotton imported
        (especially the lower grades) is in a greater or lesser degree mixed.
       There are various kinds of "openers," but the one generally in use
        at Oldham consists of an endless feed apron upon which the cotton
       from the mixing is spread, a pair of rollers vi^hich regulate the feed,
       and a series of, beaters which, revolving (inside a circular casing) at
       the rate of 1,000 to 1,500 revolutions per minute, seize upon the
        cotton as it is delivered from the apron by the feeder rollers, and
       beat it out, as already described. As the cotton passes through the
       machine, a fan draws out all sand, dust, and leaf left behind. The
        cotton placed upon the feed apron is scraped down from the front
        of the stack containing the mixing : in this way a portion of each
        layer is obtained, and passed through the ["] opener." From the
       "opener" the cotton is transferred to the "lap" machine, in which
          it undergoes another beating, and by which it is turned out in the
       form of a "lap" or fleecy roll, ready for the next process. In some
        cases the "opener" and "lap" machines are attached and continuous;
        in others they are separate. Both machines are similar in construc-
         tion, and both bear some resemblance to the "scutching" machine, to
       which the fleecy out-turn of the lap machine is conveyed for further
       manipulation. It is at the scutcher (or intermediate lap-machine)
        that the final mixing of the A^arious sorts or qualities of cotton
        generally takes place. If a spinner desires to blend in certain
       proportions two or three diff"erent growths or grades, he can more
        effectually accomplish the object at the "scutching" machine than
        at the "opener." The staple production of Oldham is 32's twist,
        of which there are various qualities : the difference in value
       between the highest and loAvest grades being about Id. per lb.
      The character of the mixing will, therefore, depend upon the
        quality of yarn which it is the wish of the spinner to produce.
      But as the same quality of yarn can be produced by different
       blendings of cotton, the nature of the mixing will also depend
      upon the prices of the different growths of cotton at the time of
       mixing. If American is plentiful and cheap—cheaper relatively
       than other growths—all American will be used. If Brazils or
       Egyptians of suitable grades sink below the paritj^ of American

```

```
                        41
     a blending of Brazil and American or Egyptian and American
     will be used. If American becomes comparatively scarce and
     relatively dear owing to a semi-failure of the crop, and simul-
     taneously the supply of Surats increases, as was the case in the
     season 1881-82, then a blending of American and Surat will l^e
     used. If a larger proportion than usual of the American crop is
     stained by frost, or reduced in grade by rains and storms, then a
     blending of stained or white, or of dirty and clean cotton, or a
    mixture of all four, will be used. All the cotton having passed
     (each quality or growth separately) through the lap machine, and
     being freed from the heavier extraneous matters with which it
     entered the "opener," the blendings of the various qualities can be
    made with a much nearer approach to mathematical exactness
     than if the cotton had been mixed at the outset. Supposing the
    mixing to be divided into four portions of equal weight, and that
       it is desired to use equal portions of four different growths or
      qualities, or equal portions of only tAvo, or three-fourths of one
    and one of another, the requisite quantities of each description,
      as delivered from the first lap machine, are passed together
     through the next, or intermediate lap machine, called a scutcher,
     in which machine the cotton is operated upon by two sets of
     beaters, the first going at the rate of about 1,000 revolutions per
     minute, and the second at a still higher speed. In this way, the
     several laps, constituting the mixing, are thoroughl}^ blended and
     reduced to a single fleece, free from many impurities which had
     previously escaped. On emerging from the second set of [beaters,]
     the fleecy product passes between two[ sets][ of] rollers which press
    and deliver it in a continuous "lap," in which form it is trans-
     ferred to the final or "finishing scutcher," from which, after
     further beating and mixing,[ it] emerges[ in][ a][ "lap"][ or][ felt-like][ fleece,]
     about forty inches wide and half an inch in thickness, wound
    on an iron roller ready [for][ the][ carding][ engine.]
       Although nearly the whole[ of][ the][ grosser][ extraneous][ matters,]
     such as sand, dust, heavy [leaf,] pieces of shrub, and fragments[ of]
      seed, have been beaten [out] of the cotton by the opening and
     scutching machines, there[ still] remain[ in][ the] fleece many lighter

                        42
        impurities, such as "neps" or small wasty tufts, bits of leaf, short,
       immature, or perished fibres, and possibly a sprinkling of light
        dust. Moreover, the fibres are in a tangled mass lying across each
        other and more or less curled uj). Before the cotton can be spun
        into -yarn it is necessary that the lighter impurities aforesaid
         shall be removed, and that the fibres themselves shall be straight-
       ened and combed parallel to each other. The first of these
        services is completed and the second commenced by the "Carding
        engine," a machine consisting (for Oldham counts) of one large
        or central cylinder, about 40 inches in diameter; a "taker in"
        cylinder, about 9 inches in diameter, situated in front of the
       main cylinder and immediately behind the feed-roller, which is
       the first to operate on the " lap " brought from the finishing
        scutcher; a " dofFer-roller," about 26 inches in diameter, and
        situated at the back of the main cylinder; and a series of carding-
         rollers, about 6 inches in diameter, and "clearing-rolh.TS," about
        4 inches in diameter, placed alternately over, and in contact with,
        the upper surface of the main cylinder, between the "taker in"
       on the one side and the "dofFer" on the other. The whole of
        the cylinders and rollers are of uniform length or width; all are
        clothed with cards or wire brushes with teeth bent at a particular
        angle, and all rotate like so many circular brushes—the large
        cylinder in the centre and the others at various points round and
        in contact with its upper circumference. An iron framework
       supports the whole. The fleecy roll or "lap" from the finishing
        scutching machine being placed in position in front of the carding
       engine is gradually unwound, and passed over an iron plate and
       under a fluted feed-roller about 2 inches in diameter, which
        brings the cotton into contact Avith the first carding cylinder or
               ^' taker in." This cylinder strikes downwards and revolves much
        faster than the feed-i-oller, the "laj?" therefore is broken up, the
          filjres are drawn out, and the greater part of the impurities which
       remained after scutching are shaken out and fall to the floor.
      On the upward journey of the "taker in," the tufts of [cotton][ are]
       caught by the teeth of the main cylinder, which revolves in an
        opposite direction to the "taker in." They are then caught by the

                      43
       first ["] clearer-roller," and subsequently by the first ["] roller card,"
    from which they are again taken by the teeth of the main cylinder,
    and in this wa.y passed through the whole of the clearers and
      rollers until the fibres after these oft-repeated combings are freed
    from all impurities, and removed in a straight and elongated
     condition parallel to each other, from the main cylinder by the
     "doffer" cylinder, by which they are further combed, and from
    which they are stripped, by a rapidly vibrating doffing comb, in a
     continuous film almost as thin and transparent as a spider's web.
     This film, over a yard in width, is gathered together and passed
     through a funnel-shaped ring, then between two pairs of rollers,
    which deliver it in a soft riband-like untwisted foi'm about an inch
      in thickness, called a "sliver," into a can about 36 inches deep and
     about 9 inches in diameter. The can is placed on a revolving dish,
    and the web falls into it through a coiling motion, which causes
     the sliver to be deposited in a continuous coil, so that it can easily
     be drawn out for the next process without being stretched. The
     can when filled is removed and replaced by an empty one. The
      leaf, waste fibres, and other impurities driven into and retained by
     the wire clothing of the various portions of the carding engine
     remain there until the engine is stopped for cleaning, which is
     done about five times daily. The teeth of the card clothing,
    which it is essential to keep as level and as sharp as possible, have
     to be ground several times in the course of a Aveek. Both
      ''strijDping" and "grinding" were formerly done by hand, and are
      so still in the older mills, but in the more modern establishments
     they are done by self-acting processes. A single carding engine
      will turn out in a week, of 56|- hours, from 400 lbs. to 600 [lbs.] of
      slivers suitable for 32's to 40's weft ; a double engine, that is, a
    machine with two main cylinders and a double set of rollers,
      clearers, &c. will produce from 900 lbs. to 1,000 lbs. per week. (^)
                   ( ^ ) In fine spinning mills the cotton after passing through some one of
      the varioiis makes of carding engines is put through the comliing machine
      originally invented by Mr. Heilmann, of Alsace, but subsequently consider-
      ably improved, and now frequently used in preparing cotton for the
     medium counts of yarn and for thread making.

                        44 -
        The cotton is now free from neps and other impurities, but
        spite of the operation of carding many of the fibres still overlap
       each other, while the sliver itself lacks uniformity and evenness of
        texture. These defects are almost entirely removed by the
       drawing-frame, a machine in which a number of slivers are put
       together and drawn out into a single web, as long as the com-
       bined lengths of the original slivers. For Oldham counts, six cans
         filled with carding slivers are placed at the back of the drawing-
       frame; their ends are then brought together over curved levers
      and plates, and passed united through a series of four pairs of
        rollers situated immediately behind each other. Each pair of
        rollers travels at a diff'erent speed: the second quicker than the
          first, the third cjuicker than the second, and the fourth quicker'
       than the third. The total difference between the first and fourth
        pair is as one is to six, so that the united sliver emerges from the
       fourth pair of rollers drawn out to six times its original length.
        It is moreover greatly improved in appearance, the fibres being
        straighter and the web itself more uniform in texture than in the
       carding sliver. On the completion of the drawing process the
        sliver passes through a funnel, then between a pair of calender
        rollers to a coiling motion into a can, ready for the next process.
       This doubling and drawing operation is repeated a second and
       third time, and the original slivers are said to have passed through
       three heads of drawings, in course of which they have received
       216 drafts and doublings: 6x6 = 36x6 = 216, the result of which
          is an even spongy web or cord of straight and parallel fibres.
      The number of doublings and drawings necessary to produce the
        result desired dej^ends upon the character of the cotton used and
      upon the counts of yarn to be spun. American cotton requires
       fewer drawings than that of any other country, and genuine
       Orleans fewer than any other variety of American. Hence the
       general popularity of American cotton, and the exceptional
       popularity of the variety known as Orleans. For Oldham 32's
       the usual practice as already described is to have three drawings,
      though occasionally two may be deemed sufficient. For fine
       counts as many as six drawings may be requisite.

                     45
      The cans containing the slivers from the last head of
    drawing, or last box as it is called, are now taken to the back of
    the "slubbing-frame," in which machine the slivers are joassed
    through three pairs of rollers and wound on bobbins about 1
    inches in length. The rollers revolve at different velocities, the
    draft between the first and third pair varying from 4 to 6, so that
    the web on its passage is increased from 4 to 6 times in length,
   and correspondingly reduced in thickness. On leaving the last
    pair of rollers the attenuated sliver is wound on a bobbin by
   means of a spindle and flyer, receiving at the same time a slight
    twist to enable the elongating process to be continued in the next
    or "intermediate-frame." Two slubbing bobbins are placed on the
    "creel," or "rack" of this frame. The ends of the slubbings are
    joined, and the two are passed through three pairs of rollers, by
    which they are drawn and reduced to a single sliver, which is
   wound on a bobbin slightly smaller than that belonging to the
    slubbing-frame. The doubling, twisting, and winding are continued
   and completed in the "roving-frame," which is similar in construc-
    tion to the slubbing and intermediate frames, except that it
    contains more spindles and uses smaller-sized bobbins. The
     sliver after this three-fold drawing, twisting, and winding is
    greatly reduced in thickness, and is now called a "roving." Up
    to this point, the last process in the card room, the exj)enditure
    in wages, is for 32's twist and 40's weft, from |d. to rird. per lb.,
    including of course the wages paid in connection with the
    mixing and scutching processes.
     The rovings are finally converted into yarn by either the "mule"
    or the " throstle," (^) but for Oldham counts the former machine
                ( ^ ) In the throstle the rovmgs after being drawn through rollers pretty
    much the same as in the mule pass to a row of spindles fitted with bobbins
    and flyers, and are simultaneously twisted into yarn and wound on the
     bobbins. The yarn made by the throstle is harder, stronger, and more
    even than that made by the mule. For certain purposes throstle yarn is
     indispensable. It is used almost entirely for warps, or for making thread.
     It is more costly to produce than mule yarn, and therefore commands a
     higher price. The mule, however, produces much finer yarn (that is to
     say, much higher counts) than it is possible to spin by the throstle. As
    already stated in a previous chapter, the throstle was originally called the
     water-frame, and throstle yarn still goes by the name of Water Twist. In

          is the one in [almost] univei'sal use. The bobbins containing the
       rovings are placed on [the][ creel] or shelf of the mule, the ends of
       the rovings are then[ passed][ through][ a][ series][ of][ rollers][ and][ cleaners]
      by which they [are] [drawn][ out][ and][ smoothed,][ and from][ which][ they]

       which recedes from [the][ rollers][ to][ the] distance of about five feet,
        at a slightly greater speed than[ that] at which the rovings are
        delivered. On the return journey [the][ yarn,] [which][ in][ the][ meantime]
       has been stretched [and][ spun,] is wound upon the spindles, and the
       outward journey [is] [again][ repeated,][ with][ a] fresh delivery of yarn
       from the rollers. The mules of the present day contain about
        1,000 spindles [twist][ cop][ guage,] or about 1,200 spindles pin cop
        guage. The twist cops are used for warp, and the pin cops for
        weft. The mules are erected [in][ pairs,][ and][ each][ pair][ is][ worked][ hy]

         32's twist from 2,000 [spindles,] at a cost of £3 for wages, which
           is equal to about iVd. [per][ lb.]

     of the mechanical contrivances described in previous chapters uj)on
    the development of the cotton manufacture, until we get down
     to the commencement of the present century. The information
     available, however, shows that between 1770 and 1800 the
    character of the industry was completely revolutionised, and
    that during the transition period, which witnessed the disappear-

       respondingly wide fluctuations. In 1770 the import of raw
        cotton into Great Britain reached about 4,000,000 lb., or about
        10,000 bales of [the][ present][ average][ weight;][ and][ West][ Indian][ was]
         selling at 10|d. to 14d. per lb. At that time the industry was
        entirely a domestic one, and what Mr. William EadclifFe, in his
      work on the ["] Origin of Power-loom Weaving," says of the state
         of things in the parish of Mellor, Cheshire, fourteen miles from
       Manchester, was true of other districts. There were in the parish
       some fifty or sixty farmers, and out of these only six or seven
        raised their rents directly from the produce of their farms, the
         rest getting them partly from some branch of trade, such as
        spinning and weaving. " The cottagers were entirely employed
        in this manner except [for][ a] [few][ weeks][ in][ the][ harvest.] * * *
      The father of a family would earn from eight shillings to half
       a guinea at his loom, and[ his][ sons][ six][ or][ eight][ shillings][ per] week ;
       but the great [sheet-anchor][ of][ all][ cottages][ and][ small][ farms][ was][ the]
        labour attached to the hand-wheel [;"] and as it required six to
        eight hands to prepare and spin yarn of either cotton, wool,
        or flax sufficient for the consumption of one weaver, the industry
        afforded an inexhaustible [source] of employment to all classes of
        the population. From 1770 to 1788, says Mr. RadclifFe, "a
        complete change had gradually been effected in the spinning of
        yarns ; [that][ of][ wool][ had][ disappeared][ altogether,][ and][ that][ of][ linen]
       was also nearly gone ; cotton, cotton, cotton was become the
        almost universal [material][ for] [employment] ; the hand-wheels were
           all thrown into lumber-rooms ; [the][ yarn][ was][ all][ spun][ on] common
        jennies; the carding for all numbers up to 40 hanks in the
       pound was done on carding [engines] ; but the finer numbers of 60
         to 80 were still carded by hand, it being a general opinion at
        that time that machine carding Avould never answer for fine
       numbers." In weaving no great alteration had taken place
         -Cartwright's improved poAver-loom not being brought out until
        1787. The displacement of linen and woollen yarns led to a
        considerable increase in the demand for raAV cotton, and eventually
         to a serious advance in prices. We have already stated that the
       import in 1770 was about four [million][ pounds,] and the price of

          1788 20,467,436 14d. to 33d.
      In the rise in prices between 1771 and 1781 we see the
    influence of Hargreaves's "jenny," invented in 1764, but not
    brought into general use until several years afterwards ; and of
    Arkwright's water-frame, invented in 1769. The average ad-
    vance betv/een 1771-5 and 1776-80 was about 50 per cent. ; [but]
    the small import of 1781 led to a further rise of about another
    50 per cent., the extreme figure of 4 Id. being paid for an
    exceptionally fine lot of Barbadoes cotton similar to modern Sea
    Island. In 1782 the import ran up to nearly twelve million
    pounds (or 30,000 bales of 400 lb.), and it is stated that the large
     arrivals produced quite a panic in Manchester ; but though con-
    siderable fluctuations took place in prices, "West Indian did not
    sink below 20d., while for the best quality as high as 40d. was
     paid. The effect of the increased supply, however, was felt in
    1783, in which year the average [price][ of][ West][ Indian][ fell][ to] 24 [Jd.]
    against 30d. in 1782, although the import had fallen to less than
    9f [million][ pounds.] Part of the fall in 1783, however, was due to
    the termination of the war with the newly-founded American
    Eepublic, during the continuance of which [values] of most kinds
     of imported commodities had been more[ or][ less][ inflated.] In 1 784
    the import rose to nearly llj [millions,][ and][ prices][ receded][ to][ an]
    average of 18|d. per pound. In 1785 Arkwright's patents were
   thrown open. In the same year cylinder printing, by means
     of which the productive power of labour was increased one
    hundredfold, was introduced into Lancashire by Livesey, Har-
    greaves, Hall and Co. The result was an extraordinary develop-

      ment of the trade. Prices of cotton advanced to an average of
       20id. per pound, followed by 32d. in 1786, and [30id.] in 1787,
       against 18|d. in 1784, although the imports for the three years
       increased to 18, 19, and 23 [million] pounds respectively, against
       11| [millions][ in] 1784, [and] 9f [millions][ in][ 1783.] It was estimated
       that 500,000 pieces of muslin alone were produced in Great
       Britain in 1787; and in reply to a protest made by the manu-
        facturers against the import of Indian fabrics [the] Company stated
       that ["] every shop offers British muslins [for][ sale][ equal] in appear-
        ance, and of more elegant patterns, than those of India for
        one-fourth, or perhaps more than one-third, less in price." The
      weight of cotton consumed [in] 1787 was estimated to have been
       distributed as follows :
                                                      Lbs.
              Calicoes and Muslins 11,600,000
             Fustians 6,000,000
              Silk and Linen Mixtures 2,000,000
            Hosiery 1,500,000
            Candlewioks 1,500,000
                        Total 22,600,000
       This is double the quantity used only three years previously,
      and there can be no doubt that the [increase] consisted mainly of
        calicoes and muslins.
         There is not the least doubt that [production] had overtaken[ con-]
      sumption ; the fact that cotton [fabrics] had[ largely][ superseded][ those]
      composed partly or wholly[ of][ linen][ notwithstanding.] The result
      was a glut of goods and a[ fall][ in][ prices,] [which][ ruined] numbers of
       people in the trade,. and led [to][ the][ panic][ of][ 1787-88,] [during] which
       occurred the failure of the [great] manufacturing[ firm] of Livesey,
        HargreaA'-es, Hall and Co., who, as already stated, were the first
        to introduce [cylinder printing][ into][ Lancashire.] The crisis was so
       severe that many years afterwards Mr. Kirkman Finlay, of
       Glasgow, said [that] he [thought] at the time that the trade would
       never recoA^er [from] it. The manufacturers maintained that the
       mischief had been brought about, not by over-production at
      home, but by [excessive] [imports][ of][ East][ Indian][ piece][ goods,][ which]
      had been forced on[ the] [market][ at][ ruinously][ low][ prices] ; [and][ they]

    appealed to the Government to save the rising domestic industry
    from the destructive competition of these foreign imports. At
      first the Government refused to move in the matter, on the
    ground that the import of printed goods was ah^eady prohibited,
    while the greater part of the plain fabrics imported were re-
    exported, and that any legislative interference with the East
    India Company's business would encourage smuggling, and throw
     the trade into the hands of foreigners ; [but][ ultimately][ the] duties
    were raised from time to time, until in 1803, those on white
     calicoes reached nearly 60 per cent., and in 181.3 about 85 per
     cent. ad. vol. The crisis of 1787-8, however, was eventually
     beneficial to the industry, inasmuch as the forced sales and low
     prices occasioned by the panic led to a wider distribution of the
    new fabrics, and therefore opened up a more extended market
     for them in a shorter space of time than would have been the
     case under ordinary circumstances. Even in 1785, a writer in
    Macpherson's " Annals of Commerce " testified that the new
    cotton fabrics had largely superseded the use of silk fabrics, and
     the cambrics, lawns, and other goods made from flax.
         Still more rapid progress was made between 1788 and 1800.
    Crompton's mule was invented in 1779, and was rapidly adopted
    throughout the manufacturing districts. " The mule-twist now
    coming into vogue," says Mr. EadclifFe, in his account of Mellor,
    " for the warp as well as weft, added to the water-twist and
   common jenny yarns, with an increased demand for every fabric
    which the loom could produce, put all hands in request, of every
    age and description, The fabrics made from wool and linen
     vanished, while, the old loom-shops being insufficient, every
    lumber-room, even old barns, cart-houses, and outbuildings of any
     description, were repaired, windows broke through the old blank
     walls, and all fitted up for loom-shops." " The weekly circu-
     lation of money, as the price of labour only, rose to five times the
    amount ever before experienced in this district, every family
     bringing home weekly 40, 60, 80, 100, or even 120 shillings per
     week." Naturally this new wealth enriched not only the operators
     themselves, but those among whom it circulated, part of it finding

      <£1 8,000,000 of all other descriptions of produce exported in
     1801 ; and the extent to which our shijiping was em2)loyed in
    what may be termed the international trade of Europe is shown
    by the circumstance that of .£31,000,000 of produce imported in
     1801, £10,000,000 were re-exported.
       Between the years 1800 and 1815 there were necessarily
     very considerable fluctuations in supply and prices, owing to the
      political disturbances of the period. The import of raw cotton
     rose from fifty-six million pounds in 1800 to nearly seventy-five
     millions in 1807; and prices receded from 18d. to 14|d. for
     middling uplands. In 1808 the arrivals fell to 43 million pounds,
    owing to the American embargo, and the average price rose to 22d.
    In 1810 the import rose to 132 millions, and in the following year
     prices sank to 12^d. In 1812 commenced the war between this
     country and the United States, and the arrivals in that and the
     subsequent two years reached only 63, 54, and 60 million pounds
     respectively, owing to which the average price of ujDlands ad-
    vanced to 16fd. in 1812, 23d. in 1813, and 29id. in 1814.
    During this period there was considerable distress in the manu-
     facturing districts, the suffering occasioned by the scarcity of
    employment being aggravated by a general rise in the value of
     provisions. Wheat, which averaged only 73s. Id. per quarter in
     1807, rose to 122s. 8d. in 1812, and still averaged as high as
      106s. 6d. in 1813 ; while beef, purchasable at 4s. 6d. per stone in
     1808, rose to 6s. 4d. per stone in 1812 and 1813. In 1815 the im-
     port of cotton ran up to 100 million pounds, and prices receded to
     average of 20|d. After the peace of 1815 the imports increased
     year by year, and prices gradually declined until they reached
     8Jd. in 1822. The actual consumption of cotton in 1815 was
     about 82,200,000 lb., but the figures had reached 98,000,000 lb.
     in 1810, against 48,400,000 lb. in 1801, about 28,000,000 lb. in
     1791, 7,000,000 lb. in 1781, 4,000,000 lb. in 1771, and 2,000,0001b.
     in 1751. This rapid growth naturally gave rise to a considerable
    demand for labour in the cotton manufacturing districts, while it
     greatly augmented the volume of our trade with foreign countries.
    The movement in population is shown in the following statement

    ment made by M'Culloch (" Pi-inciples of Political Economy,"
     page 123) that "it was the rapid growth of the cotton manu-
     facture that hore us triumphantly through the contest with
     revolutionary France, and gave us wealth and power sufficient to
     overcome the combined force of almost all Europe, though wielded
    by a chief of consummate talent." The secret of the success was
     the fall in values brought about by the inventions of liargreaves,
     Arkwright, Crompton, Cartwright, and others.
       In 1779 Crompton was paid 14s. per pound for spinning-
     yarn of 40 hanks to the pound ; [the][ cotton,][ say][ 18] ounces, would
      cost, at the then market price, about 28., making the total value
      16s. per pound. In 1784 Arkwright was paid 10s. lid. for 42's
      twist, everj^thing included ; he Avould probably get his raw
     material at Is. 9d. per pound, or about 2s. for 18 ounces, this
    would leave 8s. lid. for labour, profits, &c. The same quality of
     yarn was selling at 7s. 6d. per pound in 1799, and at 2s. 6d. in
     1812. In 1786 the price of yarn 100 hanks to the pound was
      38s. ; in 1796, 19s. ; in 1806, 7s. 2d. ; and in 1812, 5s. 2d. ! In
     the same years 18 ounces of the West Indian or Sea Island cotton
    would cost about 4s., 3s. 6d., 3s., and 2s. 4d. respectively. These
      facts are embodied in the following table :
                              Yarn 40 hanks to the lb.

     A similar decline took place in the cost of producing piece
     goods, but there are no reliable statistics in existence showing the
    market prices at the above dates. The above figures prove that
     as regards 40's yarn, labour was fourteen times more productive
     in 1812 than in 1799, nine times more productive than in 1784
    and four times more productive than in 1799. As against the

       primitive spinning-wheel the power of production was[ as][ 1][ to] 200 !
      That is to say, one spinner in 1812 could produce as much in a
       given time as 200 could have produced [before][ the][ invention] of
       Hargreaves's jenny.
        As nearly as can be ascertained there Avere about 100,000
       machine-spinners, 200,000 hand-loom weavers, and, probably,
       5,000 to 7,000 power-loom weavers, in employment in 1815.
      The number of mule spindles at work was about 6,000,000.
      Taking the average of three years, 1815 to 1817, the extent of
       the manufacture was about as [follows] :
           Cotton consumed 92,600,0001b.

         Cartwriglit, shall now be described. There was not much
        progress made during the first five years of the period, the
        trade being more or less disturbed by the changed condition
         of things which followed the peace of 1815. As the cotton
        industry had benefited more than any other by the war, so it
        experienced the greatest reverse when peace was restored. The
       consumption of the raw material which in 1810-11 averaged 85
         million pounds, against 48 millions in 1801, increased to only 92
         millions in 1815-17; while the weight converted into goods,
       which in 1810-11 stood at 71 million pounds, fell to 69 millions
         in 1815-17, and rose to only 80 millions in 1818-19. Meanwhile
        the export of cotton goods, which in 1809 reached 216 million
         yards, and in 1810 211 millions, averaged only 229 millions in
        1818-19. During this period the operatives in the manufacturing
          districts Avere only partially employed, and no progress of moment
       was made in mechanical improvements. After 1819, however, as
        already chronicled, commenced the series of improvements in
        the appliances for spinning and weaving, the economical results of
       which we are about to describe.
         Owing to the more or less disturbed state of the trade between
        1815 and 1818, we shall start with the three years 1819-21, and
       compare the average statistics for these years with the three years
       ended 1831, 1846, 1861, and 1882 respectively. This chrono-
         logical division of the figures will furnish a greatly condensed,
       but for all practical purposes a sufficiently complete, account of
        the progress made by the cotton industry during the period
       under review. The first statement furnishes an account of the
       weight of cotton consumed and of yarn produced at the various
        periods named :
           Cotton consumed..

      The rapid growth of the export trade has greatly diminished the
         relative importance of the home trade. Of the whole weight of
        Goods produced the proportion retained from home consumption
         in 1880-82, was only [18-4] per cent, against [25*6] per cent, twenty-
        one years ago, and 46-1 per cent, fifty years ago.

        without any exportation," that he comes to the conchision " that
         the cotton manufactures of Great Britain have not attained the
       summit of their greatness." He does not say one word of India
        or China, evidently considering competition with the native
         spinners and weavers of the East out of the question, and yet the
        spinners and weavers aforesaid were ah'eady beginning to regard
        with apprehension the rapidly rising importance of the British
        cotton industry. Only six years after the date at which Mr.
        Smithers wrote, the native Bengal manufacturers and dealers in
        cotton and silk goods, in a petition to the Government asking for
        a repeal of the then existing duties on textiles imported from
        India into the United Kingdom (10 per [cent,] on[ cottons] and 24
        per cent, on silks), pleaded, " That of late years your petitioners
        have found their business nearly superseded by the introduction
         of the fabrics of Great Britain into Bengal, the importance of
       which augments, every year, to the prejudice of the native manu-
          facturers." "They, therefore, pray to be admitted to the privilege
         of British subjects, and humbly entreat your lordships to allow
         the cotton and silk fabrics of Bengal to be used in Great Britain
                      ' free of duty ' or at the same rate which may be charged on
         British fabrics consumed in Bengal ; ["] which at that time was 2 J
        per cent, ad valorum. Only forty years previously to this a similar
        memorial had been sent up from Manchester praying for protection
         against the " highly injurious " and " unfair and dangerous com-
         petition" of "the muslins and cotton goods imported from the East
         Indies," Avhereby the British manufactures were "exposed[ to][ con-]
         tinued danger and immense losses ; " and Avhich memorial was drawn
       up by a committee [including][ Sir] Richard[ ArkAvright,][ Mr.][ Robert]
          Peel, and the leading manufacturers of [Lancashire,][ Cheshire,] and
        Derbyshire ! So that within the short space of a single generation
         the character of the trade in cotton goods between [England] and
         India had been almost completely revolutionised. What occurred
        between 1831 and 1881 is shown in the following brief statistical
        statement of the annual average weight of [cotton] goods consumed
         in India, and the proportions [supplied] by [native][ and][ British] manu-
          facturers, respectively, in the periods 1831-5, [1856-60,] and[ 1880-1:]

     ployed, and of wages paid, at the various dates given in pre^'ious
     tables, puts this matter of the reduced cost of production in a
    very clear light. In 1819-21 the weight of yarn produced was
    106,500,000 lb. per annum. At that time Mr. Kennedy, in a
    paper published in the Proceedings of the Manchester Literary
    and Philosophical Society, gave 40 hanks to the pound as the
    average count of yarn spun, and two hanks per spindle per day as
    the average rate of production. On this basis the total number
     of spindles at work would be about 7,000,000. The average
    annual production of yarn in 1829-31 was 216,500,000 lb.
    The average production per spindle per day (according to Mr.
    Kennedy, Mr. Babbage, Dr. Ure, and others) was from two and
     three-quarters to three hanks, against two hanks in 1820. The
   number of spindles in existence was, therefore, about 10,000,000,
    assuming 40's as the average count of yarn spun. This compu-
     tation, allowing for further gradual improvements, agrees with
    Dr. lire's estimate of 12,000,000 as the number of spindles at
   work in 1835. The first official count of spindles took place
    towards the close of 1849. The number returned by the Factory
    Inspectors was 20,977,000. The Aveight of cotton consumed in
    that year was 630 million pounds, and of yarn produced 561
    million pounds, or 26f lb. per spindle. At the same rate the 523
    million pounds of yarn produced, on average, in 1844-46 would
    require about 19,500,000 spindles. In 1861 there were, according
    to the factory returns, 30,387,000 spindles at work. The average
    annual production of yarn in 1859-61 was 910 million pounds.
   The out-turn per spindle was therefore about 30 pounds. In
    1882 there Avere about 42,000,000 spindles at Avork, and the out-
    turn of yarn Avas about [31-5] lb. per spindle.
      In 1819 Mr. Kennedy estimated the number of hand-looms
    employed in the cotton manufacture at 240,000, and the number
    of poAA'er-looms at from 14,000 to 15,000. Between 1830 and
    1835 the number of hand-looms at Avork Avas variously estimated
    at from 200,000 to 250,000—probably an aA^erage of 225,000
    Avould not be far from the mark for 1829-31. At the same
    period there Avere about 80,000 poAver-looms at AA^ork. In 1849,

      according to the Factory Inspector's returns, there were about
      250,000 power-looms at work, and 225,000 Avould be a fair
       estimate for 1844-46, at which period there Avere also about
      60,000 hand-looms employed[ in][ connection][ with][ the][ cotton][ trade] ;
      about 165,000 hand-loom weavers having been[ either][ drafted][ into]
       the mills as power-loom weaA^ers, &c., or transferred to the silk
      and fancy goods trades, between 1830 and 1845. In 1860 there
      were about 400,000 power-looms in existence, and hand-loom
      weaving had nearly ceased to form an item[ in][ the] [manufacture][ of]
       cotton goods. In 1882 there were about 550,000 looms[ at] work.
         In 1881 there were about 686,000 [persons] directly emj)loyed
       in the cotton industry. In 1861 the number so employed was
      about 646,000. The number in 1851 Avas 585,000, and in 1841
      486,000 : an average between these two[ Avould][ give] 5-35,000 as
       the number employed in [1846.] In 1830 the number of operatiA^es
      was about 515,000, and in 1820 about[ 445,000.] On the basis of
       statements published at various [dates][ betAveen] [1821][ and] 1860, by
      Mr. Porter (in the " Tables of Eevenue, Population, and Com-
       merce," 1821 to 1832), by Mr. [Baines] [and][ Dr.][ Ure][ (in][ their][ Avorks]

       commissioner, in 1833, by Mr. David [ChadAvick] in 1860, and by

       the weaver can now take in hand, owing to improvements in the
       construction and working of the loom[ itself.] The wages paid to

         CHAPTER YI.
          FACTORY AND CENSUS RETURNS.
     Comparison of the particulars of Operatives, Spindles, and Looms employed^
         as furnished by the earliest and latest complete returns made by the
        Inspectors of Factories.—Large increase in number of mills carrying on
        spinning and weaving separately : comparatively very small increase
         in mills engaged in both branches —Comparatively small increase in
         labour, compared with the increase in machinery ; and large increase
         in female and juvenile labour, compared with increase in adult
       male labour.—Diminution of the industry in Scotland and Ireland.
        Fluctuations in the number of sjpindles and looms at various periods,
        1850 to 1878.—Reasons why the manufacturmg branch of the industry
           is frequently less profitable than the spinning branch.
      The earliest complete Factory returns, giving the number of
     spindles and looms as well as the number of hands employed,,
    were issued in 18-50, and the latest in 1878. A comparison of
     these two returns shows that some very considerable economic
     changes have taken place in the course of the past thirty years.
    In the following statement will be found the separate particulars
     relating to the three divisions into which the industry is divided.
      First, the mills which spin but do not weave ; second, the mills
    which weave but do not spin ; and third, the mills which both
     spin and weave. The first spin yarn for sale either to home
     manufacturers or to exporters ; the second weave cloth from yarn
     purchased from the first ; and the third mostly weave the yarn
    spun by themselves, we say mostly, because some of them have
     occasionally to purchase yarn, while others have sometimes a
     surplus to sell.

    and in the number of factories and looms devoted to weavino;
     only, as against the mills combining both branches. This change,
     however, though sj^read over the entire jieriod of twenty-eight
     years, was more marked during the last eighteen, and most
    marked during the last eight years, as is shown in the following
     analysis of the returns for 1850, 1861, 1870, and 1878.

        mills engaged in both spinning and weaving : the total increase
       being 110-7 per cent, in spindles and 106-2 per cent, in looms.
      The increase in mills combining both spinning and weaving is
       only 40-4 per cent, in spindles and 41-1 per cent, in looms. This
      may be taken as an indication that, as respects the great bulk of
       the yarn spun, or cloth woven, the two branches or processes can
       be more economically worked separately than together.
             Still more remarkable changes, than those to which we have
        already referred, will be seen in the figures relating to the
        operatives employed. For the United Kingdom the increase in
       hands is only 46 per cent., while the increase in spindles is nearly
       111 per cent, and in looms over 106 per cent. In spinning mills
       only there is an increase of about 189 per cent, in spindles, but
       only 63 per cent, in hands employed ; [and] in weaving mills an
        increase of 360 per cent, in looms, but only 253 per cent, in
        operatives. This, of course, shows that the machinery has
      become more and more automatic or self-regulating, thus re-
        quiring the attendance of a relatiA^ely smaller number of workers.
      The same circumstance has also of late enabled the mill owners to
      manage their business with a much smaller proportion of the
      more expensive class of oj^eratives than formerly : their places
      now being filled by juveniles or young women. The total
        increase in the number of hands employed in spinning mills,
       between 1850 and 1878, was 60,376, of Avhich more than two-
          thiixls, or 42,698, consisted of women and children; so that
       whereas thirty years ago males over 13 years of age constituted
        40-6 i^er cent, of the hands at work, they now constitute only
        36-2 per cent., leaving 59-4 and 63-8 per cent, respectively for
      women and children. In the same way the proportion of males
       over 13 years of age employed in weaving mills is now only [28*4]
       per cent, against 34 per cent, in 1850, leaving 71-6 per cent, for
      women and children against 66 per cent. In mills engaged in
       both spinning and Aveaving there is an absolute decrease of 10,820
       males emploj^ed, and an increase of 31,716 women and children:
        so that of the total number of hands emploj-^ed in 1878 only [31*7]
       per cent, consisted of males over 13 years, against 41 per cent, in

                      75
    1850; leaving [68-3] per cent, for females and children against 59
    per cent. For the United Kingdom the total increase in the
   number of operatives employed is, as already stated, 46 per
     cent. The increase in children alone is 313 per cent., and in
    females over 13 years 42-1 per cent., but in males over 13 only
    18*8 per cent. The particulars in respect of age and sex are as

   The proportion of females over 13 years is almost stationary, but
    there is a large increase in the number of juvenile operatives, and
    a corresponding decrease in the number of males over 13 years.
     It will be gathered, therefore, from this table, and the one imme-
    diately preceding it, that the improvements in machinery during
    the past thirty years have not only led to a diminished ratio of
    increase in the number of hands employed, compared with the
   number of spindles and looms brought into operation, but that
    they have also led to a still greater proportionate diminution in
    the more ex^iensive class of operatives—that of males over 13
     years.

          These figures, which are doubtless more complete than the
        factory returns, show an absolute decrease in the number of males
       employed in 1881 compared with 1851 : the decrease, moreover,
        being in the older and more expensive class of labour. On the
        other hand, there is a considerable increase in the number of
        females employed, especially in respect of those over 20 years of
         age. Altogether there is a decrease of 11-2 per cent, in the
      number of males, but an increase of 28-4 per cent, in the number
        of females, employed. In respect of males 20 years of age and
        over there is a decrease of 28,156 or 15 '6 per cent., while in
        respect of females of the same age there is an increase of 63,498
        or [36] "1 per cent. The total increase in the number of people
       employed is barely 10 per cent. ; [whereas,][ as][ shoAvn] in previous
         tables, the increase in the number of sjDindles and looms is over
       110 jDer cent, and 106 per cent, respectively.
         The following statement shows that while considerable
        progress has been made in England, both Scotland and Ireland
       have fallen back :

    there was an increase of about 110 per cent, in the number of
     spindles, and about 106 per cent, in the number of looms ; but
    though, at the close, the rekitive positions of the two branches of
    the industry were about the same as at the opening of the period,
    there occurred several intermediate fluctuations of imjiortance.
    These are shown in the following fia;ures :

       than the demand for goods, the looms got more quickly to work
       than the spindles, and though the latter shortly followed, the
        former, for a little time, kept ahead, and thereby laid the founda-
         tion of the unsatisfactory state of trade which ruled in 1882-83.
            It is a matter of common observation that the weaving, or
        manufacturing, department of the industry is always the first to
          feel the approach of a period of [depression][ in][ trade] ; in fact, even
      when there is a large and apparently remunerative business going
         on, and when the spinning mills are declaring good dividends,
        manufacturers frequently complain that their special section is
        doing very badly. For the past two years, for instance, the
       market reports have been continually telling us that though
        the position of sjDinners was fairly satisfactory, that of manu-
         facturers was not only the reverse of this, but was going from bad
         to worse. The explanation is very simple. In the first place, it
         costs considerably less to put up an increased number of looms
        than it does to bring into operation an equivalent number of
         spindles, while it also requires a much smaller amount of floating
         capital to work a weaving shed than[ it] does to conduct a spinning
         mill of corresponding dimensions. Moreover, wea^dng can be
         profitably conducted on a much [smaller] scale than is possible in
        the case of spinning. An operative weaver who has saved a few
       pounds can hire both looms and[ power,] [and][ with][ the][ assistance][ of]
        a Manchester cloth [agent can][ commence][ business][ on][ a][ very][ small]
          capital. If times are good he makes money and[ invests][ it][ in] the
         hire or purchase of more looms ; if business becomes bad he fails,
        pays a dividend, and goes on [again] ; or his looms, after standing
          idle for a while, pass into the hands[ of][ another] Aveaver. To put
       up a spinning mill, however, requires a large capital, both fixed
       and floating ; and it is not possible for a small spinner to com-
       mence business with hired spindles, in imitation of the small
        weaver, who, by renting a few looms, becomes a full-blown
        manufacturer. It is easy to understand, therefore, how, when[ the]
       margin of profit is satisfactory, an [increased] [number][ of][ looms][ can]
        be brought into operation more quickly than can an increased
       number of spindles ; it is equally easy to grasp the reason why

```

-----

```
    competition amongst manufacturers is much keener than it is
    amongst spinners, and why spinners can retain a margin of profit
     for some time after that of the manufacturer has vanished.
      But the principal reason why the manufacturer is frequently
     at a disadvantage compared with the spinner is the fact, that the
     latter has several markets at which he can sell his yarn, while the
    former has practically only one in which to sell his cloth. The
    spinner disposes of the bulk of his yarn to the home manufacturer
     of calico, but he also sells a not inconsiderable quantity to the
    Yorkshire and other manufacturers of mixed fabrics, and to thread
    makers, while he disposes of a still greater quantity for export to
    -Continental, East Indian, and other markets. As it only rarely
    happens that the whole of his customers simultaneously slacken
     their operations, he is less frequently under the necessity of forcing
     sales than is the case with the manufacturer. The result is that
    the weaver has often to sell his cloth in a weak market and buy
     his yarn in a firm one. So long as the manufacturer keeps his
    looms going he must have yarn no matter what the price, but in
     dull times, Avhen demand is small and stock large, he must, if he
    wishes to sell, take the best price the buyer of calico can be
    persuaded to give. Eventually he may be compelled to stop his
    looms. Thereupon will follow a diminished demand for yarn,
    which, if it continues long enough, will cause spinners first to
    reduce their prices and then to curtail their production. Simul-
    taneous ["] short time ["] amongst both spindles and looms will lead
     to a reduction of sui'plus stocks, and by-and-by bring about a
     revived demand, first for goods and then for yarn. During the
      first portion of the revival manufacturers will do better than
     spinners ; [but][ when][ the][ Avhole][ of][ the][ looms][ have][ got][ to][ work][ the]
     spinners \vill once more be able to make their own terms as to
      price.

     Down to about twenty years before the close of the last
    century the cotton imjiorted into Great Britain came almost
     entirely from the Mediterranean, chiefly from Smyrna. Occasional
     parcels arrived from the West Indies, but nothing of moment,
    and in the article " Cotton," in Postlethwyt's Dictionary of
    Commerce, published in 1766, there is no mention of America as
     a soui'ce of cotton supply, though in another part of the Dic-
     tionary it is stated that cotton wool was grown in South America,
    but was not exported. Small shipments of cotton were made
    from Charleston in 1748 and 1757, but these were probably of
    West Indian origin. The first recorded import into Liverpool
    from the American Colonies took place in 1771, and consisted of
     three bales from New York, four bags from Virginia and Mary-
     land, three barrels from North Carolina, and four bags from
     Georgia, but it is not unlikely that a portion of these imports
     consisted of West Indian cotton transhipped. There is no record
     of any imports from America between 1770 and 1784, though
     possibly some may have been received. In 1784, a little over a
     year after the independence of the Colonies was acknowledged
    by the mother country, [eight] bags[ of][ cotton][ were] imported in an
    American vessel from the United States into Liverpool. As the
     greater part of the cotton hitherto imported from the Colonies
    had consisted of AVest Indian produce, transhipped or re-exported,
       it was very naturally surmised by one of the ciistom house
       officials that these eight bags might also be of West Indian origin,
     and, as such, could not, according to the then existing navigation
     laws, be legally imported in the vessel of a foreign country, which
     the new republic had now become. The eight bags were, there-
      fore, temporarily detained by the official aforesaid, until he was
      satisfied they were really produced Avithin the United States.

     The curiosity of the incident consists in the fact that it was
      doubted whether so large a quantity of cotton as eight hags could
      have been raised in the country adjacent to the port of shipment!
     The cotton was consigned to Messrs. William Rathbone and Son,
       the great-grandfather and grandfather of the senior members of
       the present firm of Messrs. Rathbone Brothers and Co. The con-
      signment does not appear to have been of a very desirable quality,
       as it remained in the warehouse for several months, waiting for a
       customer. Eventually it was sold to Messrs. Strutt and Co., of
      Derby, most likely by Mr. Nicholas Waterhouse, who acted as
      broker for the Messrs. Rathbone and other importers as well as
        for Messrs. Strutt and Co. and other spinners. He commenced
       business as a cotton broker in 1780, and was the founder of the
       present firm of Messrs. N. Waterhouse and Sons.
        The first import from the Brazils took place in 1781. It
      came from Maranham, and was described as inferior in quality
      and badly cleaned. Later on came small quantities from
      Pernambuco, which were classed with the better sorts of West
       Indian. The total import of all kinds of cotton in 1781 reached
       only 5,198,778 lbs., equal about to 13,000 bales of 400 lbs.,
       against an average of 6,766,613, or nearly 17,000 bales of 400 lbs.,
       in 1776-80. The AVest Indian crops had been seriously injured
      by a severe hurricane in 1780, but the chief cause of the diminished
       imports was the interruption to commerce occasioned by the
       circumstance that England was at war not only with her
      American colonies, but also with France and Spain. The
       defeat of the Franco-Spanish fleet by Admiral Rodney in
        April, 1782, enabled a large number of West Indian ships
        to sail for England. Eleven from Jamaica alone arrived
        in Liverpool in July. Large supplies also arrived from
       other sources, attracted by the high prices produced by the
       previous scarcity. In this v/ay the total imports into Great
       Britain in 1782 reached 11,828,039 lbs., equal to 29,500 bales of
      400 lbs., against only 13,000 in 1781. Between 1771 and 1776
       the prices of* West Indian had ranged from 9^d. to 14d. ;
      between 1776 and 1780 the range was from 16d. to 25d. ; in

     1781 the opening prices Avere from t9d. to 25d., and the closing
    from 36d. to 48d. ; at which date Smyrna was selling at 34d. on
     the spot and at 32d. "to arrive." Part of this rise was due to
     large speculative operations, which, meeting with no support from
     spinners, ended in disaster to those concerned. In 1783 the
     import fell to the equivalent of 24,300 bales of 400 lbs., but in
     1784 rose to 28,700 bales. In the meantime prices rapidly
     declined until West India stood at from 14|d. to 20d., and
    Smyrna at 13|d. to 14|d. In 1785 Arkwright's patents, which
    had already been extensively utilized by outsiders, were thrown
    open to the public. The consequence Avas an immense imjDetus
     to the consumption of cotton, and although the imports in that
     year equalled 46,000 bales of 400 [lbs.] and in 1786 48,600 bales,
     prices rapidly advanced, until at the end of the last named year
    West Indian was selling at 27d. to 42d., Maranham at 42d. to 48d.,
    Pernam at 56d. to 59d., and very fine Bourbon at 7s. 6d to 10s.
     per lb. ! These prices stimulated imports and checked consump-
      tion, and in 1787 and 1788, with imports equal to 58,000 bales
    and 51,000 bales of 400 lbs., respectively, values fell to from 14d.
     to 20d. for West Indian and 18d. to 2 Id. for Pernambuco.
      The increased supplies were chiefly from the West Indies
    and the Brazils, Turkey giving but little additional assistance.
     Spinners Avere quite convinced that unless some new source of
     supply could be found [the][ progress][ of][ the][ rising][ industry] Avould
    be checked, if not altogether arrested. Xaturally enough it
     occurred to them that India, the cradle of the cotton industry,
     Avould be more likely than any other country to furnish them
      Avith their much needed raAV material. Accordingly, in 1788,
    Manchester urged the East[ India] Company to promote the import
     of cotton from the territories under their jurisdiction. The
    Company thereupon [commenced] to bring forAvard a feAv parcels
    by way of experiment, but the quality Avas so unsuited to the
     Avants of our spinners that it could not be sold except at unre-
     munerative prices. " It is eAddent, therefore," says a letter of the
    Hon. Court, dated May 20, 1792, ["][ notAvithstanding][ the] flattering
     allurements held out by the British manufacturers, that the

        article ^dll by no means answer." Under such circumstances it
      was not surprising that the imjjort, Avhich in 1790 had reached
      422,207 lbs. (1,000 bales of 400 lbs.), fell to only 3,351 lbs. (8
       bales) in 1791, and to nothing at all in 1792. But as pretty
       liberal supjilies were received from the West Indies and Brazils
       (the average receipts in 1789 to 1792 from all countries being-
      about 80,000 bales of 400 lbs.), spinners ceased to grumble,
       especially as prices sank to something like half the figures touched
       in 1786. In 1793 the import of all growths fell to the equivalent
       of only 47,000 bales of 400 lbs., but as stocks were liberal prices-
      again receded : speculation being curbed by monetary stringencj''.
     The political disturbances of the times caused considerable fluctu-
       ation during the years 1794 to 1796, but without much net
      change : the prices at the end of 1796 being only slightly higher
      than those at the close of 1793. Meanwhile the import had
      averaged about 69,000 bales of 400 lbs. for the three years. But
       stocks had been greatly reduced, and in 1797, with an import of
      only 58,000 bales of 400 lbs., prices gained 9d. to 15d. per lb.
     The upward movement continued[ in] 1798 and 1799, although the
        arrivals reached 79,000 and 108,000 bales of 400 lbs. respectively;
      and in the last named year Brazils touched 4s. 2d. to 4s. 8d.,

       appealed to the East [India] Company[ to][ stimulate][ the] shipment[ of]
       cotton from their Eastern possessions, with the same result as
        before. The imports of Surats and Bengals in 1799 and 1800
      averaged 16,000 [bales][ of][ 400][ lbs.][ against][ only][ 4,400][ in][ 1798][ and]
       2,000 in 1797, but they could not be sold, and the Company,
       writing to [the] [Governor][ of] [Bombay][ in][ May,][ 1800,][ trusted] to his
        " exertions for providing tonnage for our returning shipping
      without [the] aid of this arlide." The consequence was that the
      import of ["][ this][ article][ "][ fell][ from][ 16,000][ bales][ of][ 400][ lbs.][ in][ 1800]
        to [1,700][ bales][ in][ 1805] !
        The truth is that the requirements of the British cotton

       unexpected quarter. In 1784 doubts were entertained as to

     whethei^ so large a quantity as eight small bags of cotton could
     have been raised in the Carolinas, and in 1792 the probability of the
     South becoming a large cotton producing country was considered
      so remote that Mr. Jay, in the treat}^ -which he negotiated with
     Great Britain, gave his consent to an article which stipulated that
     no cotton should be exported from America : the object being not
      to exclude American cotton, but to ensure to British shipowners
     the carriage of West India cotton to Europe. And j^et only eight
     years later (1800) the export from the United States amounted
      to nearly eighteen million pounds, or about 45,000 bales of 400
       lbs., of which about 40,000 bales came to Great Britain ! In
     1803 the import from America reached fully 45,000 bales of 400
       lbs. against about 57,000 West Indian, 28,000 Brazilian, and
     10,000 East Indian of similar weight : the total from all countries
     being about 56,000,000 lbs. or 140,000 bales of 400 lbs. This
     .sudden development of the cotton producing powers of America
    was the outcome of Mr. Eli Whitney's invention of the saw gin,
      in 1793, of the economical results of which it is not necessary
     that anything further should be said here. This sudden appear-
     ance of a formidable competitor created something like consterna-
      tion amongst the West Indian importers. In their circular dated
     Nov. 2nd, 1801, Messrs. Ewart,Kutson and Co. said, "The quantity
     produced in Georgia and Carolina and on the banks of the
      Mississippi, in favourable seasons, will, in i^oint of weight, exceed
       all the West Indian Islands put together, and will have a serious
     tendency to depress the value of our own West India cotton.
    The consumption of NeAV Orleans and inferior Georgia is become
      verj^ general, and already precludes the sale of middling and
      inferior West India at the proportionate price we have formerly
     been accustomed to." In 1802 the import of American for the
       first time exceeded that of West Indian, and on March 1st Messrs.
     Ewart, Rutson and Co. spoke of the increasing growth of the former
      as ["] almost exceeding belief." What has since gone on is shown
      in the following statement of imports, reduced throughout to bales
     of the uniform Aveight of 400 lbs. :

     years were received vid Denmark, Sweden, Spain, the Azores,
     Florida, &c. Prices again ran up to the neighbourhood of 3s.
     per lb. : the average for uplands being 23d. in 1813 and 29-|d. in
     1814. This enabled the East India Company to get rid of their
    burthensome stock of Surats, and induced them to again become
     large importers, especially as even after the war prices remained
     at a comparatively high level : the average for uplands being
      18-id. in 1816, 20id. in 1817, and 20d. in 1818. The consequence
    was that, in bales of 400 lbs. each, the imports of East Indian
     cotton reached about 170,000 in 1818, against 17,000 in 1816
    and 2,800 in 1813 ! In 1819 and 1820 prices rapidly declined,
    and the importers were again saddled with an enormous and
     unsaleable stock, which remained in their hands for several years,
    and was eventually sold at a heavy sacrifice, some of it at
     one-third of the cost i^rice. In 1820 about 10,000 Bengals were
     actually shipped from London to China ! At the opening of the
     year the stock of East Indian cotton was equivalent to 241
     weeks' consumption ! and even in 1824, although the import had
     in the meantime been greatly diminished, the stock was still
     equal to 167 weeks' consumption ! Q)
       Eeturning to our table, it will be observed that the imports
    from the British West Indies have rapidly fallen off since 1806-10,
     until in 1881-83 they reached only 800 to 1,000 bales of 400 lbs. :
     thus affording a literal fulfilment of the prophetic utterance made
    by Messrs. Ewart, Rutson, and Co. in 1801. The Brazilian
     supplies gained ground until 1826-30, but during the subsequent
     thirty years fell behind, and in 1856-60 averaged only about
           (^) It is interesting to note here that during the interval between 1796
     and 1820 there were a number of shipments of cotton from Calcutta to the
     United States. The particulars are as follow :

           1796 864
           1798 68,736
           1799 270,816

          1806 267,300

      the same as in 1816-20. The high prices occasioned by the
      American War of 1861-65 led to increased figures ; but a large
      part of the increase was lost on the return of a lower range of
       values in 1876-80. The imports under the head of "Sundries"
       consist chiefly of arrivals from Peru, Chili, Central America,
      Foreign West Indies, Africa, and Australia.
        The imports from the Mediterranean rapidly dwindled away
     down to 1816-20; but subsequently became more important than
       ever, owing to the establishment of the cotton culture in Egypt by
     Mehemet Ali in 1821-22. Prior to this date the imports were
       chiefly from the European and Asiatic dominions of Turkey, and
       principally from Smyrna. The first shipment from Alexandria took
       place in 1821, in which year the exports amounted to 944 cantars
       of 94 lbs. each, including 235 cantars to England. In 1822 the
      exports reached 35,108 cantars, including . 7,925 cantars to
      England; in 1823 they amounted to 159,426 cantars, of which
      only 34,229 came to England; but in 1824 high j)rices brought
      141,554 cantars to England, out of a total of 228,078 shipped.
     The first recorded import into Liverpool took place in April,
       1823, and was sold at auction on the 16th May, at lid per lb.,
      on which day ujilands were quoted at 6|d. to 84d., Pernams at
       10|d. to llfd., and Surats at 5|d. to 6|d. The cotton was
      described by Messrs, Ewart, Myers and Co. as "long and
       tolerably fine in staple, but rather dull in colour, and not very
      well cleaned." The same firm in their Annual Report, dated
     December 31st, 1823, said, "About 3,000 bags have been
      received from Egypt this year, from Avhence it is thought that we
       shall hereafter have a regular import, but no accurate opinion can
       at present be formed of its extent." Messrs. Marriott and
      Rogers, at the same date, said, " This cotton has already been
      used as a substitute for Brazils with considerable success ; and
     when it shall be more carefully gathered, and its nature more
      generally understood by our manufacturers, there is every pro-
       bability of its becoming a useful and valuable substitute for the
      lower qualities of Sea Island." Our table shows that the supply
      steadily increased down to 1856-60, and then advanced by

     "leaps and bounds" until 1876-80, owing to stimulus originally
     given to the cultivation by the high prices ruling in 1861-65. Of
     late years the crops have rather diminished than otherwise, while
     they have also fluctuated considerably in quantity in consequence
     of the variableness of the seasons.
        Excejjt during the interruptions occasioned by the embargo
     of 1808, the war of 1812-14, and the small crop of 1823-4, the
     supply of American cotton down to 1826-27 kept rather ahead oi
     consumption, and at the end of 1827 the stock in Great Britain
    was considerably larger than at any pi'evious period—say 334,900
     bales (including 92,000 at the mills or in the hands of dealers in
     Manchester), or 38 weeks' consumption at the then current rate. The
     previous smallest stock was 95,500 bales, or 13 weeks' consump-
      tion, at the end of 1824; but twelve months preA-iously it had
    touched 214,600 bales, or 32 weeks' consumption. In the five
     years ended 1830, the American import was equal to nearly 75
     per cent, of the total arrivals from all quarters, against only 47
     per cent, ten years previously, and 24 per cent, at the end of the
      last century. This rapid development of the American cotton
     culture enabled the manufacturing industry of Lancashire to
    make much more rapid progress than would otherwise have been
     possible ; but the fact of so large an amount of capital and
     labour being dependent upon a single source of supply for three-
     fourths of the raw material necessary to keep the mills and
     operatives employed, soon began to be regarded as a state of
     things the continuance of which was altogether undesirable. So
     long as stocks accumulated and prices declined no one j)ractically
     interested troubled himself ; but the moment that stocks
    dwindled and prices advanced, the question of cotton supply
    came to the front, generally in the shape of grumbling at the
    Government for not having promoted the cultivation of the fibre
     in India. The century opened with middling uplands at about[ 2s.]
     per lb. ; in 1820 the price was about Is., while in 1829 the
     average for the whole twelve months was only 5|d., Avith a five
     months' stock in the warehouses of Liverpool, besides over two
     years' requirements of Surats ! During the subsequent six years

                      90
     consumption shot ahead of supply, and at the end of 1835 the
      stock of American was equal to only ten weeks' supply, while the
      average price for the year had reached lO^d. per lb. Although
      there was still a liberal stock of East Indian—say over a year's
     consumption at the then current rate—the Company was severely
       criticised for not having pushed the growth of cotton in the
      countries under their charge. The India House then published
     an account of the measures which had been adopted, from
      the year 1 780, towards promoting the production of cotton
      in the Peninsula. The high j^rices, however, stimulated produc-
      tion everywhere, and between 1835 and 1845 stocks accumulated
     and values declined. In July, 1843, there were in Liverpool 43
     weeks' consumption of American; in the same month, 1844, 36
      weeks, and in 1845, 38 weeks' consumption. In the last-named
     year middling uplands averaged onl}^ 4^d., and at the lowest
      point in the summer touched 3d. to 3^(1. At the end of the year
      the stock was equivalent to 33 weeks' consumption of American,
     131 weeks of East Indian, and 39 weeks of all growths.
     Nothing, therefore, was heard about promoting the cultivation of
      cotton in India. Short supplies, owing to diminished American
      crops, in 1846 and 1847, led to revived agitation, and in 1848
      the whole question was investigated by a Parliamentary Com-
      mittee, who examined a large number of witnesses, whose
      evidence went to show that uncertain land tenures, high taxes,
     bad roads, careless cultiA'ation, and the vagaries of the climate
     had all had a hand in retarding the growth of cotton in India
     but that these evils could not be remedied without the assistance
      of British capital and enterprise, and that they would be of no
      avail unless the manufacturers would guarantee to purchase the
     produce raised. With increased American crops, and a return to
     lower prices, the agitation soon subsided. The need, however,
      for something practical being done was recognised by the
     sending out (by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce) of
     Mr. Mackay to Western India in 1852, and by the establishment
      of the Cotton Supply Association in 1858 ; [but][ in][ 1856-60][ the]
     import of American into Great Britain still represented 77 per

                       91
     cent, of the total from all countries, while in 1860 alone it
    equalled nearly 84 per cent ! During the American War it fell
    to a small fraction ; in 1866-70 it rose to 43 per cent. ; in 1876-80
    to 71 per cent. ; [and] in 1883 to 71| per cent., after having
    touched 74 per cent in 1881.
      In former years the Continental spinners received a large
    portion of their requirements from Great Britain, but of late
    years they haA'-e obtained the bulk of their supplies direct from
    the countries of growth, especially since the opening of the Suez
    Canal. To obtain a complete view of the more modern phases of
    the cotton supply question we must regard the matter from the
    stand point . of the whole of Europe. For this purpose we have
    constructed the following table, which gives a statistical view of
    the import of cotton from all countries into Europe in the years
    1860 to 1883. The bales are throughout of the uniform weight
   of400lhs.:—

       during the American War failed to raise the import into Europe
        to more than 1,374,000 Q) bales of 400 lbs. against 949,000 in
        1861,' was a proof that the crop could never at any time have
       reached one-half of the smallest previous estimates. Making the
       most ample allowance for native consumption, it is doubtful if the
       Indian crop ever exceeded 2,250,000 bales, or, at the outside,
        2,-500,000 bales. This was first demonstrated by Mr. Samuel
      Smith (Messrs. Smith, Edwards and Co.), who visited India in
       1863 ; and his conclusions were confirmed in a remarkable degree
      by Mr. Rivett-Carnac, the Government Cotton Commissioner,
      who thoroughly investigated the matter in 1868. The high
        prices caused by the cotton famine, however, gave an impetus to
       the culture in India which it would not otherwise have obtained,
       and thereby secured to Europe a permanent increase in supj^ly.
       Moreover, the quality of the cotton has been so materially im-
       proved by the introduction of better methods of handling the
        crop, that ["] Surats ["] are no longer despised as they were up to
       within a few years ago.
        The Brazilian supply rose from 48,000 bales in 1860 to
       309,000 in 1868, then fell back to 217,000 in 1870, owing to the fall
        in prices, but recovered to 377,000 in 1 872 in sympathy with the
         rise in A^alues occasioned by the semi-failure of the American croji,
        but, with the return of lower prices, subsequently receded to
       47,000 in 1879. The better rates of 1881 and 1882 brought
        increased imports, but the total in the last named year was still
       only half that of ten years previously. The Egyptian supplies
       have fluctuated considerably, but the variations have been due
      more to the changeableness of the seasons than to the ups and
      downs of prices. The suj^ply from Turkey and other Mediter-
       ranean sources shoAved a large increase chiring, and for several
       years after, the American War, but the imports have since fallen
       back to the insignificant position held in 1860-61. Similar
               (^) The import from India in 1866 was 475,000 bales larger than in 1865,
        but at least half of the increase consisted of old cotton which would have
        been shipped in time to have arrived here in 1865 but for the prostration of
         business and the reduction of shipping facilities caused by the monetary

      fluctuations have taken place in the supplies from the West India
     and miscellaneous sources. It took an average of 1 7|d. for upland
    and 12|d. for Dhollera to bring cotton from China, and when
      prices sank to 15|d. and 12d. respectively the imports ceased.
       In 1860 the total import into Europe reached 4,837,000
      bales of 400 lb., or an average of 93,000 bales per week. Of this
     aggregate supply the United States furnished 4,058,000 bales, or
     78,000 bales per week, and [83-9] per cent, of the total import ! In
     1861 commenced the war between North and South, and in 1862
     the import of cotton into Europe fell to 1,439,000 bales, or only
     about 27,000 bales per week; of which only 102,000 bales, or
     barely 2,000 bales per week, came from the Southern States, equal
     to only 7 per cent, of the entire supply, against [83] "9 per cent, two
     years previously. In the same year .52,000 bales were exported
     from Liverpool to the Northern States, so that the net receipts
     from America were only 50,000 bales, or less than 1,000 bales
     per week, against 73,000 bales per week in 1860 ! This sudden
      cessation of supplies occasioned great distress amongst the cotton
      operatives in Europe, but especially amongst those of Lancashire.
    The consumption of cotton in Great Britain, which in 1860
     averaged 51,700 bales of 400 lb. jjer week, fell to 21,700 bales
      in 1862, aud touched only 18,000 in November of that year
      affording only a little over two days per week employment for the
     more than half-a-million operatives engaged in the staj^le industry
      of the county. Spite of the fact that prices ran up to 30d. per lb.
      for Middling Orleans, and averaged about 24d. for the year, the
     import in 1863 only exceeded that of 1862 by about 500,000 bales,
      of which 250,000 came from India and China, and 180,000 from
     Egypt and Turkey. The mills, therefore, could not work more
     than an average of barely three days per week : the consumption
      of cotton for the year being only 22,500 bales per week against
     51,700 in 1861. In 1864 Middling Orleans touched 31|d. per lb.
     and averaged 27|d. per lb. for the year. In the same year 32d.
     was paid for fair Pernam., 30d. for fair Egyptian, and 24d. for
       fair Dhollera— the average for the year being 28fd., 27|d., and
      21|d. per lb. respectively. But even these famine prices failed to

                       94
      bring more than a further increase of 688,000 bales, of which
      195,000 came from India, 158,000 from China and Japan, 133,000
      from Egypt, 78,000 from America (blockade cotton), 61,000 from
      Turkey, 60,000 from the Brazils, and 3,000 from miscellaneous
       sources. A good portion of the increased supply was taken by
       the Continent, and 41,000 bales were exported to the United
        States, against 37,000 in 1863 and 52,000 [in][ 1862.] The average
      consumption of Great Britain was, therefore, increased by only
      about 4,000 bales [per] week,[ bringing][ the][ total] up[ to] 26,600 [bales]
        of 400 lb. per week. In the meantime enough employment had
      been found for the operatives, either in Lancashire (chiefly in
       carrying out public works) or [elsewhere,][ to] reduce the applicants
       for relief to a weekly[ average][ of] 134,498[ persons,][ against] 280,548
       in 1863, and 485,454 [in] [November,][ 1862.] In 1865 the war came
       to an end, and by [the][ close][ of][ the][ year][ the][ famine][ was][ also][ at] an
      end ; but the average weekly consumption of cotton in Great
       Britain was [still] only 41,000 [bales] against 51,700 in 1860, and
        prices, after sundry [violent][ fluctuations,][ were][ in][ December][ still][ at]
       21|d. per lb. for middling[ Orleans][ and][ at][ 2][ Id.][ for][ middling][ upland.]
       Supplies came forward very slowly, and it was hot until 1868
       that the import into Europe got back to the figure touched in
       1861, [Avhile][ the][ great][ import][ of][ 1860][ was][ not][ equalled][ until][ 1871,]
       in which year the [arrivals] [from][ America][ alone][ reached] 3,409,000
       bales of 400 lb. In the meantime the fall in prices had led to
       materially diminished [arrivals] from every[ other][ source.]
        The distress occasioned hj [the][ stoppage][ of][ supplies] from the
      United States was felt much less severely on the Continent than
       in England, partly because the industry was less important in
       extent, but chiefly because [instead] of being concentrated in one
       small district it was spread over the entire Continent, which cir-
      cumstance made [it] [comparatively][ easy][ to][ find] work[ for][ the] hands
      thrown out of employment. The rate of consumption fell from
       34,500 bales [of] [400][ lb.][ per][ week][ in] 1860, to only 15,000 bales in
       1862, and [rose] to 28,900 in 1866. The last figure was 5,600
        bales, or 16-2 per cent, behind 1860. In Great Britain the
       decrease was 9,400 bales, [or][ 18-4][ per][ cent.]

         CHAPTER YIII.
    THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF ENGLAND, THE CONTINENT,
      AND THE UNITED STATES SINCE 1801, AND OF
               INDIA SINCE 1861.
      Relative positions of the English, Continental, and Ameiican Cotton
         industries at the opening of the present century.—[Statement][ showing]
        the movements between 1821 and 1883.-—Position of Great Britain
       shows no change of moment down to 1845 ; but relative increase
         in America greater than on Continent.— Since 1845 England has
        gradually lost ground, but especially since 1865-70. — Enormous
         increase in the consumption of Cotton everywhere, but especially in
        the United States and on the Continent ; rate of increase on the
        Continent three times, and in the United States four times, as great
         as in England.—Increased production of Cotton Goods on the Ccn-
         tinent and in America being chiefly consumed at home, have not come
         into competition with England in outside markets ; but India a
        formidable competitor in this respect.
     It is impossible to obtain any reliable data respecting the
     quantity of cotton consumed on the Continent jDrior to the
     opening of the present century ; but there can be no doubt that
       it was considerably larger than the weight consumed in Great
      Britain, except towards the close of the last centurj^, about which
     time England took the lead, thanks to [the] mechanical inventions
      of Hargreaves, Arkwright, Crompton, and others. Between
     1700 and 1750 the consumption in Great Britain did not exceed
     4,000 to 5,000 bales of 4001bs. per annum; thence to 1780 it
     increased to probably 10,000 bales per annum. In 1785 it may
     have amounted to 40,000 or 50,000 bales. Up to this date the

       quantity used on the Continent was certainly larger than these
        figures ; [but] at the close of the century England stood first. In
       the United States the consumption in 1790 was bnly ahout
        2,000,0001bs., or 5,000 bales of 400lbs. ; in 1801 it was probably
       about 12,000,0001bs., [or30,000bales;][ in] 1811 about 18,000,0001bs.,
       or 45,000 bales; the average for 1811-13 being, according to
        Pitkin, not "less than twenty millions of pounds," Q) or 50,000
        bales of 4001bs. In 1815 an official return gave the consumption
        as 27,000,000lbs., or 67,000 [bales;] in 1821 it was probably about
        30,000,0001bs., or 75,000 bales. Meanwhile the consumption on
       the Continent was, as nearly as can be ascertained, about
       30,000,0001bs. in 1801 (including 17,000,000lbs. in Trance);
       40,000.0001bs. in 1811 (including 22,000,0001bs. in France); and
       about 76,000,0001bs. [in] 1821[ (including] 46,000,0001bs. in France).
       In bales of 4001bs. the figures for 1801, 1811, and 1821 compaie
        as follow :

        The cotton industry of the Continent Avas retarded by the
       Napoleonic wars, and the chief portion of the increase shown
      between 1811 and 1821 was [gained] after 1815. The domestic
       manufactures of the United States were stimulated in an extra-
       ordinary degree by the famine prices for calico which followed
      upon the cessation of [British] imports during the war of 1812-14
        iind quite 70 per cent, of the increase in the consumption of
       cotton between 1811 and 1821 was gained before the close of
        1815. The resumption of imports, after the war, completely
       prostrated the infant industry, and suggested the protectionist
         Ijolicy adopted in 1816; in which year the import duties on
       cotton goods, which had previously been only from 7i to 10 jjer
         cent., Avere raised, at one bound, to 25 per cent.

    The Continent, after falling from 33'4 per cent, in 1821-25, to
     27*2 per cent, in 1846-.50, has risen to 3.5"9 per cent., while the
     United States, which stood at 10*8 per cent, in 1821-25, now,
      after sundry fluctuations, stands at 2-i'2 per cent.
       The movements during several of the quinquennial periods
     were more or less disturbed by financial or commercial crises.
    The influence of these disturbing causes are less apparent, and
     the general progress of the trade is more accurately ascertained,
    by dividing the sixty years into average periods of ten years

    The total increase between 1861 and 1871 was 745,000 [bales,][ of]
    which Great Britain took 399,000 [bales,][ the] [Continent] 239,000
      bales, and the United States 107,000 bales. The total increase
    between 1871 and 1883 was 3,476,000 bales, of which the
     Continent took 1,475,000 bales, and the United[ States] 1,244,000
      bales, leaving only 757,000 bales for Great[ Britain.] Between 1861
    and 1871 the relative positions of the three [sections] were[ scarcely]
     disturbed, whilst the slight change which did take place was in
     favour of Great Britain; but between 1871 and 1883[ the][ relative]
     positions were very materially altered, and the changes were
      entirely at the expense of Great [Britain,][ the][ rate] of increase on
     the Continent being about three times, and that in the United
     States over four times, as great as in England. This is placed in
     a very clear light by the following figures, which give the total
     increase in bales and the total and average annual increase per
      cent, between 1861 and 1871, and between 1871 and 1883 :

        India, and in 1874 the number was only 593,000, but at present
       there are 1,700,000 at work. The following is a statement of the
        relative importance of the various competitors and the principal
       fluctuations in the quantity of cotton consumed since 1860-1, in

     and the United States have shot considerably ahead of Great
      Britain, and it looks as if the Continent will shortly take the [lead]
      altogether.
       The increased production on the Continent is chiefly con-
    sumed at home, but spite of this our exports of yarns and
     goods thither are still much larger than they were twenty-five
     years ago, though not so large as tliey were ten or twelve years
       since. The increase on the Continent, therefore, has not taken
     from us any custom we already had, but has doubtless deprived
     us of much of what we should have had. AVith the United
      States, however, the case is different ; Ave have lost not only two-
      thirds of the business we did with them tAventy-two years ago,
     but the vast amount of trade we should have done with them[ if]
     they had been satisfied to keep on the old lines, which of course
     was not to be expected. But although the competition of
     America and the Continent has restricted our trade with them,
        it has not interfered Avith our customers in the great outside
     markets of the Avorld. In this latter respect our most formidable
     competitor is India. Hitherto the greatest sufferers from the
     competition of the Bombay and other mills have been the native
     hand-spinners and Aveavers ; [but] of late Indian yarns and goods,
      especially the former, haA^e been sold largely in China, Japan, and
     other markets in the far East ; [and][ most] unquestionably Man-
      chester has more to fear from rivals in India than from either
     Continental or jS^eAv England competitors.

          CHAPTER IX.
     THE DEPEESSION OF TRADE 1875-79. THE "RECIPROCITY"
                  DELUSION.
        Brief summary of causes which led to commercial depression experienced
           in 1875-79, especially 1877-78.—Reply to the Continental complaint
          that main cause of bad state of Cotton Industry was over-production
           in England. —Production in England seriously reduced, while that on
          Continent greatly increased. —Large temporary increase in exports
         from England to Continent, owing to changes brought about by
         Franco-German War ; [subsequent] serious decrease. —Per cajjita con-
         sumption of English Yarns and Goods, 1851-1881 : Yarns show a
           decrease, but Goods an increase.—Per capita consumption of English
         and Home-made Goods compared.—Consumption of English products
           as one yard to five of native ; [whereas] ten and twenty years ago it was
           as one to three. —Absolute quantity, however, still larger than either ten
          or twenty years ago : protective tariffs notwithstanding.—The Recipro-
           city Delusion.—Protective systems of Continent and United States
          while curtailing our trade with those countries have strengthened our
          hold upon, and increased our business with, the neutral markets of the
          world.—Weight and Value of Cotton exports to "Protected" and
         "Neutral" Markets, 1856-60 to 1876-80 compared. —The value of
          Continental and American Exports to outside markets very insignifi-
           cant.—Facts make it abundantly clear that British Cotton Industry
          quite competent to take care of itself.—Protective systems of America
         and Continent gives us full control of the' outside markets, which com-
           prise three-fourths of the population of the globe.—Folly of supposing
          that England alone would benefit by universal Free Trade.
     The season 1870-71 was one of the most prosperous periods
       in the history of the cotton trade. In that season Great Britain
      consumed 2.3-7 per cent., the Continent 20-1 per cent., and the
      United States 16*2 per cent., more than the average of the five
        yearis, 186.5-70. It was, in fact, a period of inflation, not in
       cotton only, but in every other article of merchandise. There
      was a temporary interruption in business on the Continent during
      the Franco-Prussian war ; but this only caused the inflation to

    take a more aggravated form after the war Avas OA'er. In the
   meantime, the Avar, by Avithdrawing a mixltitude of French and
   German operatiA'es and artisans from industrial employment, led
    to an abnormal demand for English textiles ; Avhile the American
    raihvaj'- mania, Avhich commenced in 1S68, occasioned an enormous
   demand for English rails, Avhich continued until 1873 : prices of
    iron, coal, &c., being run up to unprecedented figures. The cost
    of producing manufactures of all kinds Avas greatly increased,
    OAving to the rise Avhich Avas established in the rate of Avages, and
    to the advance AAdiich took place in the price of all kinds of raAv
    materials. The exceptional profits stimulated production everj-
    Avhere. In 1872 the French and German manufacturing industries
   began to recover from the effects of the Avar, and in 1873 the
   demand for English manufactures commenced to fall ofl'; the more
    so as prices had been seriously enhanced by the increased cost of
    production, to Avhich reference has already been made, and
    especially as the annexation of the Alsatian spinneries to
   Germany stimulated mill luiilding in France, to make up for the
   reduced supplj- of yarns and goods occasioned by the transfer
   beyond the tarifi' boundary of about one-third of the cotton
    machiner}^ of the country.
     English merchants and manufacturers had already commenced
    to complain of excessive stocks and unremuneratiA^e prices, and
    the rate of production AA'as arrested in 1872 and 1873. About
    this time, too, culminated the inflation period in America. 1873
    Avitnessed the failure of Jay Cooke and Co., and the occurrence
    of a host of smaller disasters. Thence to 1875 the consumption
    of cotton in the United States Avas almost stationary. The fall in
    prices led to an increased consumption in England in 1873-4. A
     still greater increase took place on the Continent, spite of the
    financial disturbance in Austria and Germany Avhich occurred in
   1873 ; but[ the][ increase][ led][ to][ augmented][ stocks][ and][ unsatisfactor}^]
    prices, and during the succeeding three or four seasons the rate of
    increase AA'as on a smaller scale. In 1875 occurred the Collie and
    other failures, Avhich for a time completely disorganised the trade
    AAdth the East. In 1875-6 there Avas less depression. People

         hoped that after the great disasters which had occurred matters
          -would improA'e. Spinuers and manufacturers [therefore][ again] in-
          creased their production. But matters did not [improve,] and the
         sHght spurts of activity which occasionallj^ took place on\y left
            affairs worse than thej^ were before. Things were no better on
          the Continent. The rate of consumption was kept up, but [the]
           deficient food crops made sales slow and[ business][ unremunerative.]
         Meanwhile trade in America was beginning to mend. In 1876
          •came the Russo-Turkish war. In the same year commenced the
             fall in sih^er and the disorganised exchanges which thence to
         1878 paralysed the trade with the East: the more so as the
        demand for yarns and goods Avas diminished hy [the][ famines] which
            afflicted India and China. The European crops were also again
           poor. The whole period from 1873 to 1878 was characterised by
         an uninterrupted struggle, first against the immediate effects of
          the inflation and extravagance which ran riot in 1870-73, and
          then against the failed food crops of 1875-78 and[ the][ disorganised]
            silver exchange, which postponed [the][ period][ of][ recovery][ to][ a][ later]
             <late than Avould otherwise have been the case. The period of
           liquidation, so to speak, culminated with the failure of the
          GlasgOAv Bank in October, 1878, [andAviththe][ disasters][ A\diich][ took]
             l)lace after that date, up to the [suspension][ of][ the][ Western][ Bank]
           of England, in December of [the] [same][ year.] Then commenced the
          recovery Avitnessed betAveen 1878 and 1883, [ending][ in][ the][ gigantic]
          business Avhich, as already stated, brought the consumption of
          cotton in Eurojje and America in 1881-83 up [to] 9,567,000 bales
            of 400 lbs., against only 7,220,000 in [1878-9] and 6,091,000 in

           During the depression Avhich, in a more or less intense
            <legree, existed betAveen 1875 and 1879, but particularly in
           1877-8, the Continental milloAvners said that the main cause of
          the mischief A\-as over-production in [England] ; and that the bad
           trade on the Continent Avas due chief! 3^ to the fact that the
          markets there Avere flooded [AA'ith] the surplus products of Lanca-
             shire, Avhich Avere sent to the Continent [because] of the reduction
            in the trade AA'ith India and China. The plain facts are, hoAvever,

      that the out-turn of cotton products was materially reduced in
     England in 1874-5 and again in 1877-8 and 1878-9, while on the
     Continent it was increased every year without exception. The
     average annual consumption of cotton in Great Britain for the
     four seasons ended 1878-9 was 4,000 bales smaller than in the four
     seasons ended 1874-5; Avhile on the Continent it was 378,000
      bales greater ! Again, for the three seasons ended 1876-7
     the average annual consumption in Great Britain was 3,142,000
      bales of 400 lbs., while for the succeeding two seasons, 1877-8
     and 1878-9, it was only 2,940,000 bales, showing a decrease of
     202,000 bales per annum ; meanwhile the average consumption
      of the Continent rose from 2,363,000 to 2,552,000, showing an
      increase of 189,000 bales per annum, against a decrease of 202,000
      bales in Great Britain. If there was any over-production, there-
       fore, it was on the Continent, and not in England. It was quite
      as great a misconception also to attribute the unsatisfactory con-
      dition of the Continental markets to the presence of excessi\e
     imports of yarns and goods from England. There was, indeed, a
     very serious decrease, as is shown in the following table, which
      gives the export of piece goods and yarn to the Continent, except
      Eussia, Turkej', Greece, and the English possessions in the
     Mediterranean, for the year 1861 and the fourteen seasons ended
      1881-2, according to the monthly returns issued by the Board of

      from France to Grermany. As already stated, the temporary
       Avithdrawal of labour from the cotton industry during the war
      stimulated shij^ments of yarn and cloth from Great Britain to
      both France and Germany, while the reduced poAver of production
       in France, occasioned by the loss of the Alsatian mills, forced up
      the price of cotton products to such a height as admitted of larger
      imports of yarns and goods from England at a profit than woiild
      otherwise have been the case. These things, however, shortly
      adjusted themselves, and later on the increased out-turn of the
     German and French mills led to a rapid falling back in the
      imports from England. In the last column of the table the yarns
     and goods exported are reduced to the equivalent of raw cotton
     by adding ten per cent, to the total Aveight of exports. The
        jjiece goods are reduced to weight on the supposition that fiA^e
      yards of cloth are equal to one pound of yarn. This may not be
       exactly correct, but it is near enough for the purpose of com-
       parison. It will be observed that, in bales of 400 lbs, each, the
      shipments fell from 446,250 in 1868-9 to 378,250 in 1869-70,
      then gradually rose until they reached 545,500 in 1872-73. They
      then rapidly declined, until they touched only 351,500 in
       1879-80, and subsequently rebounded to 463,250 in 1881-82 :
      being 111,750 bales OA-er the previous loAA^est point, but 82,250
       bales below the previous highest, and 5,250 beloAv the business of
       1861, since which[ there][ has][ been][ a][ considerable][ increase] in popu-
        lation. Taking the more complete returns published in the
     Annual Statements issued by the Board of Trade, Ave have the
      following comparison. As in the previous table, the figures
       relating to Russia, Turkey, Greece, and English Possessions in
      the Mediterranean are omitted. The statistics of population,

       The per capita import of English yarn shows little change
    compared with thirty years ago, but a very considerable loss
     compared with twenty years since. Cloth shows very little
      difference since 1861, but exhibits an increase of about half a
     yard per head compared Avith 1851. The "value" includes a
    number of miscellaneous articles, such as lace, net, &c., not
     entered either in lbs. or yards. There is a reduction of only |d.
     per head compared with 1861, but a decline of about 7f d. per head
    compared with 1871. The falling off since 1871, however, is owino-
     mainly to prices in 1881 being much lower than in 1871. The
     broad fact remains, that our business with the Continent has lost
    ground during the past twenty years, but especially during the
     past ten or twelve years, owing to the large increase in the native
     production. The extent of this increase is shown in the
     following figures :
                       Population. Cotton Spun. Per Head.
                                                    Ib^. lbs.

         1881 193,105,000 974,000,000 5-04
     Supposing one pound of cotton to represent five yards of goods,
     the domestic production was equal to [17] '9 yards per head in 1861,
     18-4 yards in 1871, and 25-2 yards in 1881. This compares as
     follows witli the import from England, assuming one pound of
    yarn to represent five yards of cloth (leaving out lace, net, &c.) :

        against all comers. It is true that the per capita consumption of
       English goods is less now than it was twenty years ago, but in
       absolute amount it is much greater, and enormously larger than it
      was thirty years ago.
         In connection with this matter of foreign eompetition, the
       present Avriter has no sympathy with those who, under the
       cry of ["] Reciprocity," advocate [a][ return][ to][ the] days[ of][ protection.]
       Aside from the impossibility of [finding] any[ article] of commerce
      upon which to retaliate, without doing more harm to ourselves
       than to our competitors, a [careful] examination[ of] all the facts of
       the case will show that[ if][ the][ protective] systems[ of][ the] Continent
      and the United States have curtailed our trade with these
        countries, they have [strengthened our][ hold][ upon,] and[ increased]
       our business with, what may be [termed][ the][ neutral][ markets][ of]
       the world.
        The following is an [account][ of][ the][ average][ annual][ A-alue][ and]
       weight of piece goods and [yarn][ exported][ from][ Great][ Britain] in
       the three quinquennial [periods][ 1856-60,][ 1871-75,][ 1876-80] :

       The decrease in the grand total of " value ["] is due entirely
      to the fall which has taken place in prices : the grand total of
     " weight ["] showing the respectable increase of about 9 per cent.
    The decrease in the value of products exported to " protected
     markets ["] is due in part to the fall in prices, and in part to the
     circumstance, already pointed out, that the trade with some of
     the Continental nations was unduly inflated in consequence of
     the economical disturbances arising out of the Franco-German
    war and the transfer of Alsace from France to Germany. Un-
     doubtedly, however, a portion of the decrease in the exports to
      " protected markets " is due to the circumstance that our Con-
      tinental and American customers are now supplying more of
      their own wants than formerly, and this in consequence of the
      fact that their home manufactures are " protected." But, spite
      of "protection," the business done in 1876-80 shows a tre-
    mendous increase upon that done in 1856-60.
       But however potent our competitors may be in their own
     " protected markets," it is quite clear from the above statement
     that thej^ are powerless against us in the ["] open markets ["] of the
     world. The quantity of American and Continental cotton fabrics
     exported to outside markets is quite insignificant compared with
     our OAvn trade, and, for the past ten years, moreover, the business
     has been almost stationary. In the following table we give the
     average annual value of cotton goods and yarn imported into and
     exported from France, Belgium, Holland, and the United States,
      in the two quinquennial periods of 1871-75 and 1876-80 :

      exports from Germany, but there is no record of their vahie
       earlier than 1880, in which year they Avere estimated at
      £2,726,800. Switzerland exports largely, but the official tables
       give only the weight : the annual average for 1871-75 was
      334,000 [centners,] [and] for 1876-80, 357,000 centners, showing an
       increase of about 7 per [cent.,][ against] an[ increase][ of] 9 per cent, in
      the exports from [Great][ Britain.]
       The imports enumerated in the above table are almost
       entirely from Great[ Britain,][ the][ exports][ from][ France][ and][ Holland]
       are chiefly [to][ the][ French][ and][ Dutch][ Colonies][ respectively.] With

     the expedients advocated by those good but misguided people
    who have allowed themselves to be victimised by a plausible
     phrase.
        Including the "home trade," the annual value of the out-turn
      of our cotton industry is about £100,000,000. Against this there
       is the formidable competition of £2,000,000 imports ! sent from
     countries which take a vast deal more of our cotton products in
     return. It is quite true that our rivals in cotton spinning and
     manufacturing in the United States and on the Continent have of
      late made great progress in the industry ; a greater ratio of pro-
      gress, in fact, than we have ourselves made ; but they have for
     the most part worn their own calicoes, and, as already shown,
     they have not in the least interfered with the sale of our products
     in the neutral markets of the world.
         It should always be remembered that protection increases
     the cost of producing manufactures. It is quite immaterial
    whether the protection takes the form of import duties upon
      articles v/hich compete with the protected product itself, or
    upon the raw material out of which it is manufactured, or
    upon the machinery with which it is made, or upon the food of
     the operatives employed in its production—they all add to the
     cost of production, and every addition made to the cost of pro-
     duction diminishes our power to compete with the products of
     other manufacturers in the open markets of the world. It folloAvs
    from this, that the greater the protection bestowed by other
    manufacturing countries upon their own products the better it is.
     for us, so far as concerns our commerce with the outside world.
     It is the protective system of the United States which has lost to
    them, and gained to us, so large a share of the shipbuilding
     business and carrying trade of the world ; and it is the protective
    system of America and the Continent which enables us to beat
    them all in outside markets, which comprise fully three-fourths of
     the population of the globe.
       This is not the place in which to enter into a discussion upon
     the whole question of Free Trade versus Fair Trade (so-called) ;,
    but it would be easy to demonstrate that what we have said in

                       116
       respect of the cotton industry is true of every other industry of
       the country. It may be true that some special branches of
       business are not in so flourishing a state as could be desired ; but
       their adverse condition is due to circumstances other than the
       operations of Free Trade. The doctrine of the survival of the
        fittest is as true of commerce and manufactures as it is of natural
       history ; and even the universal adoption of Free Trade, though
      an eventual benefit to everyone, would, until matters accom-
      modated themselves to the economical changes incidental to the
     new departure, be a sore trial to many departments of English
       industry, the conductors of which appear to think that, with
      untrammelled international commerce, English manufacturers
      would advance in "leaps and bounds," while the industrial
      systems of other nations would stand still.
        The greater portion of this chapter was written two years
       ago, but nothing has since transpired to make its recasting at all
       necessary.

         CHAPTER X.
    THE RELATIVE IMPOPvTANCE OF THE COTTON, WOOLLEN,
         AND LINEN INDUSTRIES, 1783-1883.
      Relative positions of the three Textiles in 1783—Wool first, Linen second.
        Cotton third—in respect of both production and exports.—In 1793
        Cotton takes the second place in exports, and ten years later first plase
        but in production still only third place.—Progress of the Woollen
         Industry, 1800 to 1882. —Progress of the Linen Industry during same
         period. —Cotton takes the first place in 1829-31, Linen second, and
        AVool third. — AVool and Linen change places in 1859-61.—Of the
         entire products of the three textiles Cotton forms over two-thirds.
       Between 1859-61 and 1880-82 proportions of Cotton and Linen slightly
         diminish, while that of Wool increases.—Cottons largely replace Linens
        between 1830 and 1860.—Early prejudice against Cottons disappears.
         Influence of the American AVar, 1861-65.—Exports of Cottons,
          AA^'ooUens, and Linens—total, ratio, and per head— 1798-1800 to
          1880-82.—Value of the total prodiiction of Cotton goods in 1859-61 and
          1880-82.—Similar statement in respect of Woollens and Linens.
         Relative positions of the three Textiles, in respect of production, export,
        and home consumption. —Value of Foreign Cottons and Woollens
         imported, re-exported, and consumed at home.—Value of Apparel, &c.,
         exported.—Number of Operatives employed and amount of Wages paid
          in each of the three Industries.—The disturbances in the relative
         positions of the three Industries occasioned by the American war.
        Statement of movements at various periods between 1860 and 1883.
        Cotton eventually recovers the ground lost during the war. A'^alues
        and quantities of Cottons, Woollens, and Linens exported, 1860 to 1883.
     A century ago wool held the first place in the textile indus-
       tries of Great Britain : linen being a very poor second, and cotton
      a still poorer third. In 1783 the relative positions of the three
     were about as stated on the next page.

     The figures in the first column are from Anderson's ["] Historical
      and Chronological Deduction of the Origin of Commerce," vol. iv,
        p. 522, [except][ that][ the][ sum][ of] £2,250,000[ is][ added][ for][ the][ value]
       of linens produced in Ireland, for which see Arthur Young's
     "Tour in Ireland," vol. ii, pages 91 and 92. It is impossible to
     know what worth to attach to the figures given as the estimated
       value of fabrics produced ; [but][ they] were probably not very far
      from the truth. As respects cotton, the weight of raw material
      spun was about 10,000,000 lbs. which, at 16d. per lb., the then
      average price, would be worth about £660,000 ; but[ in][ all][ proba-]
        bility two-thirds of this would be used in connection with wool
      or flax, or made into candle wicks, leaving only one-third, or
      about £220,000 worth, for cotton goods proj)erly so called, the
      value of which, in the finished state, might easily amount to
      £960,000. Ten years later, that is, in 1793, the official value of
       Avoollens exported amounted to about five and a half millions
        sterling, that of cotton to about one million and three-quarters,
      and that of linens to about one million. As respects the value of
      exports from Great Brita,in, therefore, cotton now held the second
       place and linen the third, avooI still retaining the first. But in
      another ten years cotton took the lead, and went on steadily,
       gaining ground, until it attained the first place, not only in respect
       of exports, but also in respect of the weight and value of fabrics
      consumed at home.
       At the close of the last century, Mr. Luccock, in his
       " Treatise on English Wool," estimated the production of wool in
      England and Wales at 94,377,000 lbs. The production in Scot-
      land at the same date, probably, amounted to about 10,000,000 [lbs.;]
      making a total of 104,377,000 lbs. for Great Britain. Thirty
       years later Mr. Hubbard, the well-known wool stapler of Leeds,

```
                      119
     estimated the production in England and Wales at 108,937,000 lbs.,
     which, with about 15,000,000 lbs. for Scotland, would give a total
     of 123,937,000 lbs. for Great Britain. In 1860 the late Mr. Henry
    Ashworth and others estimated the growth of wool in the United
    Kingdom at about 145,000,000 lbs. The average for 1880-82
     was, according to the valuable annual wool tables published by
     the Bradford Observer, 138,770,000 lbs. If to the foregoing
      particulars we add the weight of wool imported, and deduct the
     quantity (home and foreign) exported, we shall get the quantity
     or weight left fgr home consumption. This is done in the
      folloAving table, the figures contained in which are the annual
     averages for each period of three years ended 1800, 1831, 1861,
    and 1882. The imports include goat's hair; wool taken from
     sheep skins, estimated at 2 lbs. per skin; and Avoollen rags,
     intended to be torn up and mixed with wool.

      Annual Eeports compiled by Mr. Michael Andrews, Secretary of
       the Flax Supjjly Association. There was an important recovery
       during the American war, and for a year or two after that event
      but the whole of the increase was subsequently lost, and though
       the average annual production in 1880-82 was much larger than
        for several years previously, it was still only 57,048,000 lbs. By
      adding the foregoing figures to the quantities of flax and tow
       imported, and deducting therefrom the quantities exported, we
        shall get the weight left for home consumption, as follows :

     was keener than even during[ the][ previous][ thirty-one] years, with
     the result that the consumption of flax was almost stationery.
     For a number of years [there] was[ a][ considerable][ prejudice][ amongst]
     oldfashioned people against [the use][ of][ calico][ for][ either][ clothing] or,
     bedding, but with a new [generation] this prejudice disappeared,
     and linens were largely superseded by calicoes. The com-
      paratively greater vitality displayed by both wool and flax,,
      especially the former, between 1861 and 1882, was due to the
    new start given to both by the cotton famine occasioned by the
     American war, which brought woollen, [linen,] [and][ mixed][ fabrics]
      into such general use and favour that [cotton][ has] [not][ yet][ regained]
     the ground lost during the war. Linen has fallen slightly below
     the relative position at which it stood twenty years ago : the
     quantity consumed in 1880-82 being only [12-75] per [cent,][ of][ the]
      total Aveight of textiles spun or manufactured, against [14-18][ per]
      cent, in 1859-61 ; [but][ the][ proportion][ of][ wool][ has][ risen][ from][ 17-42]
     per cent, to [20-90] per cent., while that of cotton has fallen from
     68-40 per cent, to 66-35 per cent. In weight, the consumption of
      cotton was 5*14 lbs. per capita larger in 1880-82 than it was in
      1859-61, but wool gained only [3-75] lb. and flax only [0-45][ lb.] [per]
      head.
       The relative positions of the three branches of industry in
      respect of the value of yarns and goods exported are shown
      in the following particulars, taken from the returns published
     by the Board of Trade :
          1793-1800
            18-29-1831
          1859-1861
          1880-1882

        The values for 1798-1800 are what were knoAvn as " official
       values," but at that date they differed very little from the real or
       declared values. The figures for the subsequent periods are the
       " declared'' values. During the first thirty-one years the exports
       of cotton goods increased 8-2 per cent, per annum, and those of
       linen 3-6 per cent., but woollens fell behind. In the subsequent
       thirty years the ratio of increase Avas pretty uniform, wool taking
       a slight lead ; since then woollens have lost a little, and linens
      a great deal, of ground. At the oj^ening of the century more than
       half (52-90 per cent.) the total exports of textiles consisted of
      woollens; thirty-one years later nearly three-fourths (71 ["79] per
        cent.) consisted of cottons, which proportion has since been, on
       average, fully maintained, except during the American war.
       Since the commencement of the century the value of cotton goods
      exported has increased 15 times, but that of linen only about 7
       times, and that of Avoollens only about 3 times. The population
       of the United Kingdom was about 15,000,000 in 1800, 24,419,000
       in 1831, 28,985,000 in 1861, and 35,246,000 in 1881. The value
       of cotton products exported has increased from 6s. 9d. per head
       in 1798-1800 to 43s. 7d. per head in 1880-1882, while that of
      AvooUens has risen only from 9s. Id. to 12s. Id., and that of linens
      only from Is. 4d. to 3s. lid. per head. The increase in the
       exports of the three textiles betAveen 1800 and 1882 amounted to
        42s. 3d. per head, of which 36s. lOd. fell to the share of cotton.
         In the absence of reliable data, a comparison cannot be made
      hetAveen the values of the entire amount of cotton, woollen, and
       linen fabrics produced at the earlier dates given in the foregoing
       tables ; but fairly approximate particulars are aA^ailable in respect
       of the last tAA^o periods 1 859-6 1 and 1 880-82. In 1 862, Sir Thomas
       Bazley, Bart., estimated the A^alue of cotton manufactures con-
     sumed at home in 1859-61 at about £28,000,000. In the same
       years, the average value of yarns and goods exported Avas about
      £49,000,000. So that the average annual A^alue of the entire
       j)roduction of cotton yarns and fabrics was about £77,000,000.
      In 1880-82, the average value of cotton products exported Avas
      £76,816,000, and that of cotton goods consumed at home, about

     numbers, .£107,000,000) as the average annual value of the
     entire production. The various items which entered into the

    amounted to from £11,000,000 to £13,000,000. In 1880-82, the

     estimates being given in the valuable Annual Reports published
    by Messrs. Helmuth Schwartze and Co., Wool Brokers, of
    London. The weight of flax and tow retained for consumption
      is accepted as the probable actual consumption, except that
     40,000,000 [lbs.] are added to the figures for 1883 for flax taken
     out of stock : the stock at the end of the year being much lighter
    than at the beginning. The revision is probably correct, as the
    average annual deliveries for consumption for the four years
    ended 1883 was about 257,000,000 lbs. With these explanations
   we give the following further comparative statement :

       sank low enough to enable cotton to regain the position it held
         relative to wool and flax before the war ; and there can be no
       doubt that this struggle on the part of cotton to get back the
       ground lost during the famine has been one source of the un-
         satisfactory condition of the whole of the textile trades, about
       which both masters and operatives have for a number of years
        past had occasion to complain. During the four years between
       1864 and 1868 cotton regained a very large portion of the ground
         lost between 1860 and 1864, the proportion used in 1868 being
        61*83 per cent., against 48*78 per cent, in 1864; meanwhile the
        proportion of wool used fell from [29] '83 per cent, to 22*09 per
          cent., and that of linen from 21*39 per cent, to 16*08 per cent.
       Between 1868 and 1877 there was very[ little] relative change, but
        the return to ante-war [prices] for cotton was paving the way for
       an important [alteration][ in][ the][ relative][ positions] of the competing
          textiles, and between 1877 and 1883[ the] proportion of cotton
        rose from [62*57] per cent, to 67*95 per cent., while that of wool
          fell from [22*00] per cent, to 20*48 per cent, and that of linen
       from [15*43] per cent, to 11*57 per cent.
         The following statement contains particulars of the value of
         cotton, woollen, and [linen][ piece] goods and yarn exported in the
        years for which an account of the consumption of the raw
        materials has already been given :

        only 8 per cent, in value. In the same period the exports of
        woollens increased 27 per cent, in quantity and 52 per cent, in
         value. Woollen yarn increased about 17 per cent, in quantity
       and 45 per cent, in value. The business, especially in worsteds,
        continued to increase until 1871-72, owing doubtlessly to the
         fact that cotton had not yet fallen back to ante-war prices ;
        but since then woollens (except the heavy sorts, which do not
        compete with cotton) have experienced a material reduction, the
         exports of worsteds in 1883 being only 189,823,000 yards, against
        344,968,000 in 1872. Between 1860 and 1864 the exports of
         linens increased about 46 per cent, in quantity and over 70
        per cent, in value ; in yarn the increase was 26 per cent, in
        weight and 66 per cent, in value. The export of linen yarn
           fell back in 1866 almost to the figure at which it stood in
         1860, but the shipments of piece goods shoAved a further in-
         crease upon 1864. Since then, but especially since 1871, there
        has been a considerable falling off, owing to the decline in the
         prices of cotton products.

      The most remarkable feature or characteristic of the recent
     progress of the cotton industry of Great Britain is the extra-
     ordinary growth of co-operative or limited liabilitj'- spinning and
    manufacturing companies, especially in the neighbourhood of

       Oldham. The success of the co-operative societies in connection
       with the grocery, drapery, and other trades, suggested the
        application of the principle to the business of cotton spinning
       and manufacturing. The new departure was regarded with some
        misgivings by many who wished to see it succeed, while its
        eventual failure was confidently predicted by those with whose
        business it was to come into direct competition. But the men of
       Oldham, undeterred by either the nervous apprehensions of timid
         friends, or the terrible warnings of strong oi^ponents, determined
        to give the scheme a fair trial. The pioneer venture was that of
        the Sun Mill, which was projected in 1858, by the members of
        the Oldham Industrial Co-operative Society. The business of
        the company was at first confined to manufacturing, but as the
         results, though at the outset fairly satisfactory, Avere in the end
        unremunerative, the concern was converted into a spinning mill.
       This was in 1861. Then came the troubles and disasters arising
       out of the cotton famine, the upshot of which was that in the
      autumn of 1865, just after the close of the American war, the
        balance-sheet of the company showed a debit of over £11,000.
       During the subsequent nine months, with the return of prosperity,
        the company made over £9,700, and in December, 1866, the
        directors Avere able to declare a dividend of 5s. per share of £5
       paid up. Thence forward, down to 1870, the dividends ranged
       between 10 and 30 per cent. For the quarter ended June, 1871,
        as much as 40 per cent, was declared, and for the whole year[ the]
        average Avas 32^ per cent. A like success attended several similar
        ventures started betAveen 1867 and 1870. This circumstance,
        together Avith the highly-prosperous condition of the cotton
       industry in general in 1870-71, brought about the great "floating
       mania," which culminated in 1875, and which, along with general
        over-trading, bad harvests here, on the Continent, and in the East,
        led to the unsatisfactory, not to say disastrous, condition of
        business in 1876-79. In the two years, 1874-75, about 3,000,000
        spindles Avere [" ]floated ["] in Oldham alone, Avhile, including private
        firms converted into limited companies, 5,000,000 to 6,000,000
      more Avere ["] floated ["] in other towns and districts of Lancashire.

     mills projected in each of the eleven [years] ended 1883 compare

         price in proportion that the mills are prosperous or otherwise,
       but only a general financial crisis, combined with bad harvests
        in the East and war in Europe, could bring about a repeti-
        tion of the untoward state of things witnessed in 1876-79.
      What then took place is shown in the following comparison
         of the market value of the shares of the principal Oldham
       companies at the end of 1866 and in the autumn of 1879 ; to
       which figures are added the values for December, 1883, and
        October, 1884. The figures relate to twenty-three of the largest
         mills, each containing 70,000 or more spindles :

     shares of sixty limited liability mills was estimated by the
     Oldhavi Chronicle at £200,000 in 1877, and at £900,000 in 1878,.
     or a total of £1,100,000. But as the value of the shares at the
     opening of 1877 was more or less inflated, the actual loss to the
     oiiginal shareholders was, perhaps, not more than half a million
      sterling, to which must be added about £50,000 for loss of
     dividends. There was a further serious depreciation in the [first]
     half of 1879, but towards the close of that year matters took[ a]
     turn for the better.
      The course of the crisis was watched with intense interest by
       all students of industrial economy. Those who had faith in the
     value and stability of the co-operative principle had no fears as
     to the ultimate result ; but the pessimists regarded the crisis as
     the fulfilment of their early forebodings and as the death-blow[ to]
     the system. These entirely overlooked the fact that the unsatis-
     factory state of trade in Oldham was not at all exceptional. The
      coal, iron, and other industries were in a worse condition even
     than the cotton manufacture ; [while] the state of trade in the
     United States and on the Continent was no better than the
     condition of business in England. The depression was neither
      local in its incidence nor in its origin. There had be6n over-
     trading everywhere ; and the effect of this was aggravated by a
      succession of poor food crops in Europe and the East. Many
       critics charged the Oldham troubles to the abuse of the [limited]
      liability principle, by the original calling up of too small a pro-
     portion of the nominal capital of the companies, and by the
      excessive employment of loan [capital,][ the][ fixed][ interest][ on which]
     had to be paid when profits had disappeared and serious losses
     had commenced to show [themselves.] There was, no doubt, [some]
     truth in these allegations, one result of which was [that] many[ of]
      the working-class and[ small][ shopkeeping][ shareholders,][ who][ were]
     unable to pay calls, lost the whole of the hard earnings which
     they had invested ; whereas if they had [purchased][ fewer] shares,
     and paid up a larger proportion of the nominal capital, they
     would have been in a [position][ to][ have][ retained] their property
     through the non-dividend paying[ crisis.]

                        138
        But as to the co-operative principle itself, the crisis proved
       that the Oldham limited mills were able to weather the storm, if
       anything, rather better than those conducted by private firms
      and what has since happened proves that the co-operative or
       limited liability principle will eventually absorb the greater part,
          if not the whole, of the cotton industry, in consequence of the
       rigid economy and the vigilant supervision which attend the
      management of the mills. In this connection the following
      remarks from the last annual report of the Co-operative Wholesale
       Society are very interesting :[—] " The daily discussions which take
       place amongst the shareholders as to why dividends are small or
       otherwise, have led almost every intelligent operative to become
      more economical with materials, more industrious, and to see
      what effect his individual efforts have upon the cost of the
       materials produced. In fact, the bulk of the working-class
       operatives of Oldham have more knowledge of the buying of
        cotton, working it up, and selling the manufactured goods than
      most private emj)loyers had ten years ago. The cotton trade
       could not in these days be conducted at all if mismanaged so
      wastefuUy as was customary before the spinning companies were
        established. Profits now are not calculated by the penny or two-
        jDence per pound on the yarn as formerly ; much less than half
       those rates are now welcome, and realise good dividends. The
       competition between the managers of one company and those of
       another, and also between the directors of different companies,
      and the pride which each bodj^^ of shareholders take in their own
         mill, is constantly leading to improvements in machinery, and
      economy of every kind in manufacture, so that it is almost im-
       possible for the management of any mill owned by working men
        to be seriously defective for any length of time. These benefits,
       in our opinion, extend their influence far beyond the town itself,
      and may be regarded as the main reason why profits have for
       years been realised by the Oldham companies, and the spindles
       kept constantly working, while private spinners in other towns
      have complained of incurring losses, have lessened production,
      and shown a willinmess to retire from the business." From the

      The seventy-one mills contain almost as many spindles as
    there are in either France, Germany, or Russia, twice as
   many as there are in Austria, Spain, or Switzerland,
     nearly four times as many as there are in Italy, and about
     one-third of the total at work in the United States. And yet these
     facts convey but a very inadequate idea of the position which
    Oldham holds in the cotton industry of the country. Twenty
     years ago there were about 28,000,000 sj^inning spindles in the
    United Kingdom, of which about 3,000,000, or [barely][ one-ninth,]
    were in Oldham; last year there were about 42,000,000 in the
    United Kingdom, of which 10,000,000 [(including][ private][ mills),][ or]
     nearly one-fourth, were in Oldham.
        It is not too much to say that but for [the] thrift and energy
     displayed by the people of Oldham, and forced by them upon
    other districts, the cotton industry of Great Britain would not
    have been so successful as it has during the past ten or Jfifteen
    years in its contest with foreign [competition.] A dozen years ago
     the common calculation was that 32's cop twist could not be
     profitably produced except there was a margin[ of] 3d. to 3|d. per
      lb. between the price of the raw[ material] and[ the][ finished][ article;]
    but this can now be done at a margin[ of] from[ 2|d.][ to] 2f[d.][ per][ lb.]
    The reduced cost of i^roduction is due entirely to the improved
    machinery and improved methods of working introduced from
     time to time by the Oldham limiteds.

         The whole town bristles with all kinds of co-operative or
        limited liability industrial enterprises. Besides co-operative
        cotton mills, there are co-operative machine-works, co-operative
        banks, co-operative insurance companies, co-operative stores of
       every description, and it is now proposed to start co-operative
       manufacturing sheds, for the avowed purpose of putting an end
        to the inconvenience occasioned by the constantly recurring
        labour disputes in North-East Lancashire, in consequence of which
        the Oldham spinning mills are periodically compelled to stock
         their yarn or resort to ["] short time."

         CHAPTER XII.
     THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF COTTON IN
              THE WORLD.
     Extent of the Cotton Zone.—Exceptional position of the Southern States of
        America.—Disorganization caused by the War.—Temporary impetus
        given by that event to production of Cotton in other countries.—Per-
       manent gain to India. —Exceptional position of Egyptian Cotton.
        Quantity of Cotton produced in the United States, Brazils, Peru,
        Central America, West Indies, &c. —The quantity raised in India, and
           its distribution.—Previous erroneous estimates.—Quantity produced in
         China, Japan, Turkey, Persia, and Asiatic Russia.—The Egyptian
         crop.—Quantity raised in Africa. —The production of Cotton in Italy
        and Greece.—Summary of the crops of the world, and of their distri-
         bution. —Number of Spindles at work and quantity of Cotton consumed
          in each country in Europe and in the United States. — Consumption of
        Cotton and number of Spindles per head. —Total and per capita con-
        sumption of Cotton, including Cotton Goods imported, in each country
         in Europe.
       Cotton can be produced, and in greater or smaller quantities
       is produced, in nearly all the countries of the globe situated
     within the parallels of [40°] of latitiide, though chiefly within the
     area of 35° ; but the plant is only cultivated on a large scale, in
      places where the climate is specially adapted to produce the
     greatest quantities of the fibre, of the best qualities, at the lowest
      cost. In this respect the Southern States of the American Union
     have long held the foremost place in the industry. They lost
    ground for several years, owing to the economical dislocations
     occasioned by the War of Secession ; but they eventually iuWy
     recovered their former exceptional position, and they now pro-
     duce more than half of the total quantity of cotton raised in the
     world. For some years prior to the outbreak of the civil war it

       had been foreseen that, sooner or later, a serious labour disturb-
       ance at the South was inevitable ; [and][ in][ view][ of][ the][ calamity]
       which such an event would bring upon Lancashire, every effort
       was made to discover new sources of cotton supply. But although
        the powerful Association formed for the j^romotion of this end
        searched every nook and corner of the cotton zone, and sent seed
         to everyone in the four Continents willing to experimentize, they
        entirely failed to accomplish the laudable object they had in
        view. The high prices caused by the "famine" brought increased
        supplies from the Brazils, Turkey, India, and China ; but
       with the return of ante-war values the imports into Europe fell
       back almost to the level at which they stood in 1860-61. From
        the West Indies, Central America, South America (other than
        the Brazils), Africa, and the far East (other than India, China,
       and Japan) the imports in 1865-6 showed an increase of only
       80,000 bales of 400 lbs., or less than one week's consumption for
          all Europe. These districts now send us little more cotton than
       they did twenty-five years ago. There is a respectable increase
       from the Brazils, but the annual aggregate is [still] little more than
        the equivalent of one week's consumption. In 1860-61 the
        average import into Europe was equal to 47,000 bales of 400 lbs.
        in 1868 it rose to 309,000, fell back to 217,000 in 1870, rose
        to 377,000 in 1872, owing to. high prices, then gradually
       receded until in 1879 it was only 47,000 bales—since which
          it has got back to about 170,000. China and Jaj^an ceased to
        ship anything after Middling American fell to 15d. per lb. It
       took an average of 17^d. for Middling Upland to bring 2,000
        bales of 400 lbs. in 1862. A rise to 23id. in 1863 brought
       81,000 bales, and a further rise to 27|d. in 1864 brought
       239,000 bales ; but with a fall to 19d. in 1865 the import
       sank to 85,000 bales, while with a further reduction to 15^d.
        in 1866 the arrivals sank to 15,000 bales; after which the
       imports ceased, only 1,000 bales coming to hand in 1867.
       Turkey, Greece, and Italy, after increasing their shipments
       from about 30,000 bales up to about 240,000 bales, now supply
        only some 40,000 to 50,000 bales. India, after a temporary

     reduction, has got back almost to the figures touched during the
    war ; [partly][ because][ of][ the][ permanent][ impetus][ which][ that][ event]
    gave to the industry, and partly on account of the extension of
     the railway system, which has enabled the produce of all parts of
     the Empire to be delivered at the seaboard at a considerably
     lower price than was possible a quarter of a century ago. The
     special adaptation of Egyptian cotton for the spinning of the fine
     counts of yarn has enabled that growth to more than retain the
     increased production which took place in the course of the
    American War. There was an important temporary falling ofT
     after the war was over, but this was subsequently fully recovered,
    and in 1876 the crop was 200,000 bales of 400 lbs. larger than
     in 1865. As the demand for this description of cotton, however,
       is limited, there has been no increase since 1876 in the area
     cultivated, and as, during the interval, several of the seasons
    have been unfavourable, the crops have, on average, fallen below
     the yield of that year.
      The average annual production of cotton in the United
     States in 1881-2 and 1882-3 amounted to 2,814,000,000 lbs. net,
     or 7,035,000 bales of 400 lbs. The crops of the Brazils, Peru,
     Central America, West Indies, &c., averaged about 300,000 bales
     of 400 lbs., including about 200,000 bales shipped to Europe.
      Official inquiries show that the annual average per capita
    consumption of cotton goods in India is from 2^ lb. to 2|- lb.
    Taking it at 2^ lbs. on 254,000,000 people, we get at the quantity
     of cotton produced as follows :

         Total crop (equal 2,450,000 bales of 400 lbs.) 980,000,000
    Twenty years ago it was customary to estimate the Indian crop
      at from 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 bales, some authorities going even
     as high 'as 10,000,000 bales. Similarly exaggerated views have
    been current in respect of the quantity of cotton produced in

        China ; but the fact that 20cl. to 30d. per lb. for American and
         12d. to 24d. per lb. for Surats did not draw from China and
       Japan more than 420,000 bales of 400 lbs., or an average of only
        105,000 bales per annum, during the four years of the American
         war, proved beyond a doubt that the crop was considerably
        smaller that even that of India. Careful investigations made by
        the Japanese Government show that the consumption of home
       and foreign cotton goods in Japan averages about 2| lb. per
         Jiead per annum, against the Indian estimate of 2:^ lb. to 2|- lb.
       The accuracy of these comjjutations is further confirmed by the
          fact that the weight of English and Dutch cotton products
        annually imported into Java averages about 2| lb. per head. So
         that it is quite safe to assume that in all these and other Eastern
         countries the average annual per capita consumption of cotton
        ^oods is about 2| lb. Adopting this figure for China, and taking
        the population at 300,000,000, which is the estimate of the best
        and most recent authorities, we get at the crop as follows :

              Equal, in bales of 400 lbs., to a crop of 1,425,000
     A similar calculation for Japan, Java, Philippine Islands, Siam,
          &c., containing an aggregate population of 70,000,000 persons,
       comes out as follows :
                                                                    lb. lb.

            Consumption of native cotton, almost exclusively Japanese 53,000,009
              Equal, in bales of 400 lbs. , to a crop of 132,000
       As nearly as can be ascertained, the crops of Turkey and Persia
       amount to about 48,000,000 lbs., or 120,000 bales of 400 lbs.
       About 40,000,000 lbs., or 100,000 bales, are raised in Asiatic
         Russia. Adding these figures to those of India, China, and
        Japan, we get 4,227,000 bales as the crop of all Asia.
         The Egyptian crops of the two seasons 1881-83 averaged
       about 250,000,000 lbs. net, or 625,000 bales of 400 lbs. Almost

     the whole of this is exported to Europe. A large quantity of
     cotton is grown in the [coast][ places] and[ interior][ of][ Africa,] hut one
    can only guess at its amount. As the natiA^es are for the most
     part more economical than fastidious in the matter of clothing, it
      will, perhaps, he sufficient to estimate the requirements of all
     Africa at an average of IJ lb. per head per annum, or one-half
     the per capita rate adopted for India. The most recent authori-
     ties estimate the population of the Continent and neighbouring-
     Islands at about 200,000,000. At an average of 1;^ [lb.][ per][ head,]
     these would require 250,000,000 lbs. of cotton fabrics per annum.
    Deducting the Aveight of cotton fabrics imported, say 80,000,000
      lbs. from Great Britain, 10,000,000 from India (partly Manchester
    goods re-exported), and possibly 10,000,000 from other places,
    or a total of 100,000,000 lbs., there would remain 150,000,000
      lbs., or 375,000 bales of 400 lbs., as the amount of the cotton
     crop of Africa, aside from that of Egypt, and making Avith that
     a total of 1,000,000 bales.
       During the height of the cotton famine Italy and Greece pro-
    duced from 100,000 to 120,000 bales, but it is doubtful if they now
    produce more than about 10,000 bales. Adding these figures
    and 2,000 bales for Australia and Fiji, to those already given for
     America, Asia, and Africa, we get the following account of the
     cotton crops of the Avorld, in bales of the uniform Aveight of 400 lbs.

       Of the 35,000,000 lbs. imported into Great Britain, 15,000,000
           lbs. were re-exported. The estimated weights of goods imported
       and exported are based upon [returns][ published] by[ the][ various]
        governments. It is possible that [the][ estimated][ exports] of goods
       from Holland and Belgium [were][ rather] larger than the above
         figures, and the consumption per head smaller, but we have
       adhered to the official returns. As there are no cotton mills in
       Denmark, that country is not included in the previous table. It
        contains a population of 1,969,000, raising the total for the
        Continent to 278,265,000. The consumption of cotton goods per
       head is ['5-44] lb. for the entire Continent ; but if we exclude
         Eussia, which uses only [3-31] lb., the average is raised to [6-36] lb.
        per head. The cotton goods imported into the Continent are
        almost entirely from Great [Britain.]

         CHAPTER XIII
      THE DISTRIBUTION OF BHITISH AND IRISH COTTON
              MANUFACTURES.
       British Cotton products exported to every country in the world, hostile
           tariffs notwithstanding. — Particulars of the total and per capita value
          of the shipments to each country in Europe in 1883 and 1S53. —The
         probable x^er capita consumption of the leading groups of countries.
       Germany our piincipal customer, except Turkey and C4reece.—Great
          inci-ease in exj^orts to France owing to Cobden treaty. —Very fair
         increase in trade with Italy. —Particulars of the shipments to the
         various countries in Asia. —Though increase dixring the thirty years is
        very important, there is plenty of room for still greater expansion.
         Superior per capita value of the trade with Asiatic Turkey. — Great scope
          for increased business with China. —Remarks by Mr. Coh^uhoun, The
            I'lmeti correspondent, on this point. —Large increase in exports, if per
         capita consumption in China equalled that in Japan. — Per capita exports
          to India increased fourft)ld in thirty years, owing chiefly to improved
        communications.— If all Asia purchased as much per capita as India,
         the exports would be increased to fifty-six millions sterling, as against
         thirty-three millions in 1883.—Particulars of the trade with Africa.—
        Exports to the various Coasts and Islands in 1853 and 1883. —Slow
          increase, compared with other parts of the world, due to inaccessibility
          of the interior. —Cotton grown, spun, and woven in all the fertile
          districts of the Continent. —Well opened up, Africa might become to
         Lancashire a second India. —Particulars of exports to America and
         the West Indies.—Large decrease in the exports to the United States
        owing to the protective tariff. —Probable effect of materially reduced
          duties. —Stationary condition of the business with Mexico due to
         increased domestic production. — General increase in shipments to
         Central America and West India Islands. —Comparatively moderate
         increase in the shipments to South America owing to augmented
         production of native fabrics.—Particulars of the exports to Australia
        and the South Sea Islands. —The average per cajjita takings of the
         Colonies about the same as the consumption in the United Kingdom.

      There is scarcely a nook or a corner in the habitable globe where
       the products of the spindles and looms of Lancashire do not find
       a market, although in some of the more civilised countries special
         efforts have been made to hinder, or to altogether prevent, the
       import of British yarns and piece goods. The industry and
       ingenuity of our spinners and manufacturers, and the ability and
        enterprise of our merchants, have enabled them, moie or less
        successfully, to compete with their rivals abroad, even where the
        latter have had the protection of exorbitant import duties; while
        ip respect of the business done with the open markets of the
       world, Manchester almost monopolises the trade in cotton goods.
          In the following statement is given an account of the total
      and per capita value of the exports of all kinds of British cotton
       products exported to each country of Europe in 1883 and 1853.
      The particulars for 1853 are based upon a table compiled by
        Sir Thomas Bazley, Bai't., for his article, ["] Cotton," in the seventh
        edition of the Encydopcedia Britannica. The population and total
       value of exports are exj)ressed in 1,000's :

       Russia now than thirty years ago, it is still very insignificant,
       owing to the prohibitive tariff against goods : nearly the whole of
        the cotton exports to that Empire consisting of yarns. Sweden
       and Norway, with a less hampering tariff, show a very respectable
         increase. The increase in the shipments to Germany, Austria, &c.,
          is insignificant ; but the Germans are still far and away (except
      Turkey and Greece) our best customers (per ca23ita) on the
        Continent. France has inci-eased her takings from Id. to 13|d.
       thanks to the Cobden Commercial Treaty. Spain is characteris-
         tically stagnant. Italy has augmented her purchases from about
        12d. per head to nearly 18d. per head, which compares very
       favourably with the conduct of the rest of Europe. The increase
          for, protectionist Europe (leaving out prohibitive Russia) is 5|d.
        per head: the total per capita rate having risen from 13|d. in
         185-3 to 19|d. in 1883. The tariffs of Turke}^ and Greece are
       comparatively light ; this accounts for the circumstance that the
       consumption of British cotton jiroducts in these countries has
        increased from 2s. 4f d. per head to 4s. 5d. per head.

       Although these tables show a very important and gratifying
     increase in our aggregate shipments of cotton products to the
     Continent and islands in Asia, it is obvious, from the small per
     capita amount j'et taken, that there is ample room for further and
       still greater ex})ansion. Nothing can be expected from Russia or
     Turkestan, which is virtually Russian ; but there is room for more
     business with Turkey, Persia, and Arabia. The average per head,
       3s. 3|d., is xery good in respect of Turkey alone; but as part of
     the export to Asiatic Turkey goes to Persia and part to Arabia, we
    must take the average of the three districts together, Avhich is only
       Is. 9|-d. per head. This, however, compares very favourably with
     the figures of 1853, which show an average of only 2|d. per head.
    Our business with Turkey, in point of fact, has, in proportion to
     population, increased more rapidl}^ than with any other district
     in Asia, including even India—the increase in thirty years being
     tenfold.
      The shipments to China in 1883 were more than three times
     larger than in 1853 ; but they were[ still][ only][ 3|d.][ per][ head,] [and]
     only 3^d. per head if we include the States of Manchuria, Corea,
     Mongolia, Tibet, &c. The business with China in 1883, however,
    was excej^tionally small, owing to the less prosperous condition
      of the people in that and the previous year. In 1881 the value
      of our exports of cotton products to that Empire amounted to
     £6,831,000 ; [but][ even][ this][ is][ only][ just][ over][ 4|d.][ per][ head][ for][ the]
     330,000,000 of people, and as the business of 1881 was as
     exceptionally large as that of 1883 was exceptionally small, we
    may take it that the annual average consumption of British cotton
     products in China and its dependencies is only about 4^d. per
     head. The little state of Japan took 8|d. per head in 1883
     against nothing in 1853; while in 1880 the exports reached
     £2,008,000, or 13^d. The average of the two extremes is
     £1,645,000, or lOfd. per [head,][ equal][ to][ 6-^d.][ per] head more than
     the average for China in 1881 and 1883. The larger business
      clone with Japan is due to the circumstance that the country is
    more opened up. In one of his recent letters Mr. A. R. Colquhoun,
     The Times correspondent, says[—] " At present we are only on the

```

```
                        154
        skirts of China, with only one shaft driven into the heart of the
        country, the Yangtaze. Open China, bring goods under the eyes
        of the interior population, and if you deliver a better and cheaper
         article, the Chinaman will buy." Hitherto the authorities have
       opposed the introduction of railways and other methods of
       improved communication. "They want neither foreign inven-
         tions, foreign goods, nor foreign men. But if we have to make
        tiny way against this enormous barrier, the mandarinate of China,
        the people are fortunately not against us." Eecently, however,
       matters have moved a little in the right direction. The telegraph
        (at first opposed) is rapidly spreading over the country, and the
      same success will ere long attend the introduction of railways.
       In a few years China would become as good a customer in pro-
       portion to population as Japan, and, a little later still, as good as
        India. The population" of China" and its dependencies was in
       1853 about 365,000,000, but it is thought at present not to be
      more than 330,000,000. A per capita consumption of British
       cotton products equal to the average taken by Japan (lOfd.)
      would give a total of about £14,780,000, while a consumption
       equal to that of India in 1883 (Is. 6|d.) would give a total of
       over £25,000,000, against an actual consumption of only
       £4,808,000 in 1883, and £6,831,000 in the exceptionally active
      and higher priced year 1881.
        The exports to India have in thirty 3'ears increased fourfold
      from five millions up to twenty millions sterling, or from 6|d. to
          Is. 6^d. per head. This increase is largely due to improved
       communications, which have had the double effect of cheapening
       the price of imports to the inland consumer and lessening the
        cost of conveying his products to the seaboard for export. Bear-
       ing in mind the continually increasing magnitude of the native
       cotton spinning and weaving industry, one cannot hope for any
       great increase in the consumption of Manchester fabrics, such as
      we may calculate upon in respect of China, but we may reasonably
        anticipate a more or less gradual growth Avith the further extension
        of the railway system and the continued material i:)rosperity of
       the people.

      The exports to the KStraits Settlements find tlieir way to
     Siam, &c., giving an average of Is. 5^d. jDer head for 21,423,000
     people. Some of the shipments may go to Borneo, &c. If we
    add the populations of Siam, Anam, Straits Settlements, Borneo,
     Philippine Islands, &c., together, we get a total of 56,116,000 in
    1883 and 46,155,000 in 1853, and exports of £4,033,000 against
    £1,244,000, or Is. 5|d. per head in 1883 against 6|d per head
     in 1853. The trade in these districts has, therefore, increased
     in almost the same ratio as the trade in India, which rose from
     6|d. per head to Is. 6|d. per head. Now, if the entire population
     of Asia took Is. 6d. per head, our exports to that part of the
    world would reach the value of £56,300,000.

           Excej^t in respect of the countries bordering on the Norths
       and of the various European colonies and settlements on the West,
        South, and East Coasts, the estimated population of Africa is more
        or less conjectural ; but as we have consulted the whole of the
        leading modern authorities on the point, the figures given arc-
        probably approximately correct.
          Part of the exports to Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, &c., pass on
       by various caravan routes to the Sahara and Western and Central
        Soudan. A portion of the shipments to Egypt go to Abyssinia,
       and the surrounding districts ; part also goes to Arabia. Some
        portion of the imports into Natal and Cape Colony passes on to
        the Transvaal, Orange Free State, and the native districts beyond.
        Part of the shipments to the various foreign settlements on the
      West Coast find tlieir way into the interior by land or up the
        Niger, Congo, &c. The same remark applies to the shipments to
        the various native places in the West.
          Although the per capita consumption of British cotton products-
         in Africa has within the past thirty years increased more than
         threefold, the ratio of increase is much smaller than that which
        has obtained in Asia, Avhile the absolute quantity of goods used
         in 188-3 represented only about two yards of calico per head.-
       The chief cause of the slow progress of the trade is the inaccessi-
          bility of the interior ; for although the natives are not very lavish
         in the matter of clothing, they use a vast deal more calico than
       they get from Great Britain. Cotton is grown, spun, and woven
         in all the fertile districts of the Continent, and quite a large trade is-
         carried on in the more populous places, especially in the Soudan
         States which cross the Continent from the Nile to Senegambia.
           Besides the cotton goods imported from Great Britain, some
       £250,000 or £.300,000 worth are received from India, of which
        part consists of Manchester fabrics re-exported from Bombay, and
        the remainder of Indian goods manufactured in Bombay. All
        these go to the East Coast of Africa. If to the £180,000 and
       £40,000 received at various points from England [Ave] add [£250,000']
        received from India, we get a total of £476,000 amongst 39,000,000
         of people, or 2|d. per head; against a total of £1,354,000 taken

      "by the 91,940,000 on the West Coast, which is equal to about
      3|-d. per head.
         If Ave add the £250,000 worth of goods received from India
     to the £4,632,000 received from Great Britain, Ave get a total of
    £4,882,000 as the total of British and Indian cotton fabrics
    imported into Africa, Avhich gives a little over 5|d. per head. It
      is manifest, therefore, that there is room for a A'ast expansion in
    our shipments of cotton goods to Africa, and if the prospects are
     not spoilt by the outcome of the present political complications,
     there is no reason why Africa should not become to Lancashire
     as a second India.

       United States figure for a decrease of 2s. l|d., or about 71 per
         cent. Our American cousins numbered only twenty-three millions,
         in 1853, but they took £799,000 more of our cotton j^roducts
       than did the fifty millions in existence in 1883. There have^
       however, been considerable fluctuations. In 1851 the value of
        the exports was only Is. 8d. per head, in 1861 only llfd., but in
       1871 2s. 8d. per head. The general tendency, however, has been
       towards smaller and smaller figures, owing to the high protective
        duties imposed by the States upon imported manufactures during-
       and since the war. In the event of the adoption of a tariff similar
        to that in existence before the war, there would unquestionably be
        a very large increase in the exj)orts of British cotton products to
        the States. The increase would be chiefly in the higher medium-
       and finer descriptions of goods, but in all probability this gain to
        English cotton manufacturers would be in a great measure
        counterbalanced by a large increase in the imports of the lower
      medium and coarser descriptions of American cotton products
        into Great Britain. Lancashire can beat Lowell in the jjroduction
         of the finer makes of goods ; [but][ Lowell,] if permitted to purchase
        her machinery in the cheapest market, would be able to beat
        Lancashire in many of the lower medium and coarser sorts. Both
        nations would be benefited, inasmuch as each Avould be able to
        purchase in the cheapest market.
         The exports to Mexico show a small decrease in the per capita
       amount, but a slight increase in the actual total value. This slow
      movement is due to the large increase in the home production of
        cotton products in Mexico itself. According to Dr. P. Ormelas,
        Secretary to the Mexican National Commission to the Cotton
        Centennial Exhibition held at New Orleans, there are in Mexico
       87 cotton establishments, containing 217,894 spindles and 8,745
        looms. The weight of cotton consumed is estimated at
        25,826,000 [lbs.,] equal to 64,565 bales of 400 lbs. each. Of this
        quantity about 10,000,000 lbs., or 25,000 bales, are raised in
        Mexico. The remaining 15,826,000 lbs., or 39,565 bales, are
       imported from the United States. There is no record of the
        extent of the production or consumption of cotton in Mexico in

                     159
    1853 ; but the quantitj- imported from the United States in that
     j^ear amounted to 7,464,000 lbs., or 18,660 bales of 400 lbs.
      The shipments to British Honduras figure for a considerable
     decrease, but this is due to the circumstance that much of the
     business done with Central America, through British Honduras,
     noAv goes direct. If we take the tAvo together, the per cajjita
    value in 1853 was Is. 8d., and in 1883 4s. 7-4-d. The exports tO'
    the British and Foreign West Indies show important variations,
    owing to the fact that ever varying quantities of European pro-
    ducts imported into the West India Islands are subsequently sold
    or transhipped to the mainland, including Mexico. The ship-
    ments to Mexico, Central America, British Honduras, and the
     British and foreign West India Islands added together amounted
     in 1853 to £1,824,000, or 2s. 8d. per head, but in 1883 to
     =£3,127,000, or 3s. 7d. per head, or an increase of 34 j)er cent.
    There is no reason why our trade with this region should not
    go on increasing.
      The business with British and foreign Cuiana and with
    Venezuela and Columbia shows a good increase. The total in
    1853 was 2s. 7|d. per head, but 4s. 9|d. per head in 1883, an
     increase of 2s. Ifd. [per][ head,] or about 122 per cent. Exce^jt in
    the case of the Brazils, there are wide variations in the particulars
     respecting the other South American countries. Ecuador figures
     for 4|d. per head in 1853, but she no doubt obtained part of the
      Cs. 3d. per head exported to Peru. Bolivia is stated to have
    taken no cotton products from England in 1853, and only |d. per
    head in 1883, but she received supplies through Peru and Chili.
    Moreover, both Peru and Bolivia themselves produce cotton goods,
     Bolivia also does business with the Argentine Eepublic, and
    probably received European goods via the Eiver Plate. Part of
    the exports, which in the first instance go to Argentine and
    Uruguay, go on to Chili and up to Paraguay. The Brazils, which
    took 4s. 9^d. per head in 1853, figured for 4s. 10|d. 1883. They
    took 6s. per head in 1861 and 1871. This was partly on account
     of enhanced prices ; [but][ part][ of][ the][ subsequent] decrease is due to
     the extension of the cotton manufacturing industry in the Brazils

       per cent., in the gross, and 20 per cent, per head. The increase
       in the population of the United Kingdom is 31 per cent., and the
        increase in the consumption of domestic cotton products 41 per
        cent, in gross value, but only 7 ["6] per cent, in the value per head.
       This comparatively small increase in the rate of consumption at
      home is due, in part, to the circumstance that the domestic branch
        of the trade, as indicated by the per capita demand for cotton
       goods, had already reached figures beyond which any further
       increase of moment could not be expected ; and, in part, to the
       reduced cost of production.

       THE COTTON MARKET IN THE LAST CENTURY.
      The customs of the market in the infancy [of] the trade.—The[ first][ mentioned]
          cotton brokers,—Import into Liverpool in 1770 ; [and][ increase][ thence][ to]
          1785. —Auction sales. —The Exchange and neighbourhood.^—[Preference]

        than indoors.—Description of high 'Change a hundred years ago.
         Increase in business caused by the new spinning machinery.—The
         imports into Liverpool begin to exceed those into London.—First
        mention of brokers whose firms subsequently became eminent.—Further

         instead of in front of the Exchange (now Town Hall).—The custom
         maintained until the opening of the new (now old) Exchange buildings
        and area.
     In the infancy of the trade, when the arrivals into Liverpool
     were only trifling and intermittent, the cotton imported was
      for the most part sold to dealers, who retailed it to spinners
      in Manchester, Blackburn, Bolton, and other centres. Sometimes
        it was sold direct to the dealers by private treaty; at other

      times by auction, either by the importers themselves or by
      brokers in their employ. Sometimes the dealers themselves
      attended the auctions, and purchased direct ; at other times they
      commissioned brokers to attend and buy on their account.
       Occasionally the importers sold direct to spinners, but instances
       of this kind were very rare. Occasionally, too, sj^inners pur-
      chased through brokers, whom they commissioned to report on
      imports and offerings at auction ; but only[ a][ small][ business] was
      done in this way. The remuneration paid by the importers to
      the brokers was generally 1 per cent, on the value of the cotton
       sold. The dealers and spinners frequently paid |^d. to Id. per
         lb. as remuneration for the special technical knowledge and for
      the time which in those days had to be consumed 1by the broker,
       Avho had to attend ' the warehouse and examine and select such
       bales as in the matter of quality and staple met the requirements
       of his client. The first brokers of whom we have any mention,
      engaged in the sale of cotton, were Mr. George Drinkwater
      (afterwards Sir George Drinkwater), who, in 1766 and a few
      years previously, conducted his business in Thomas Street ; and
      Mr. Charles Lowndes, who at the same period flourished in
     Water Street. Mr. Drinkwater was broker to the Underwriters,
     and in that capacity, on the 20th September, 1766, sold a quantity
       of damaged cotton saved out of the " Molly," from Granada,
      which vessel was accidently set on fire in the river, owing to the
       carelessness of the Excise officers, who had gone into the hold to
     rummage with a lighted candle. The cotton, prior to sale, was
     on view at the warehouse of Mr. William Rathbone, " at the top
       of South Dock." (1) Between 1 766 and 1775 we find Mr. Thomas
      Eyan, of Exchange Alley ; Mr. Samuel Woodward, of Oldhall
      Street ; Mr. Joshua Holt, with a house in Moor Street and a
      warehouse in Old Ropery. As the import of cotton into Liver-
      pool in 1770 was only 6,000 small bags, and as some of these
      were sold direct to dealers for retail in Manchester, the income
      from cotton brokerages could not have been of any importance.

                      167
      All of the above-named, therefore, were general brokers, except
     Mr, Holt, whose income as a cotton broker was merely supple-
     mentary to that derived from the occupation of stay-making.
     Between 1775 and 1785, with a considerable increase in business
      (the imports rising to 25,000 bales), the little band of brokers
     was increased by the addition of Mr. George Dunbar (afterwards
      Sir George Dunbar), who resided in Tarleton Street, and had his
     counting-house in Exchange Alley, next door to Mr. Thomas
    Ryan ; Mr. Peter Kennion, of Clayton Square, with an office in
      Castle Street ; Mr. John Thompson, of New John Street, Lord
      Street, with a warehouse in Harrington Street; Mr. Andrew
      Aikin, of Mersey Street and Exchange Alley ; and Mr.
     Christopher Wetherhead, of Eoe Street, with an office back of 4,
      Castle Street. All these dealt in other articles besides cotton ;
     and as yet Mr. Joshua Holt was the only cotton broker properly
      so called. He was also the only exclusively buying broker, the
      others being exclusively selling brokers, with the exception of
     Mr. Charles Lowndes, who occasionally bought for dealers. Mr.
      Holt's business as stay-maker had brought him into contact with
      several Manchester peo^Dle, on whose account he was commis-
     sioned to examine and report upon the West India cotton
     imported into Liverpool, and for which purpose he was in the
      habit of interviewing the importers and visiting the warehouses
      in which such cotton was stored on landing. He had acquired a
      special technical knowledge of the staj^le of cotton, and for the
     most part had always orders in hand to purchase any lots of fine
     or long stapled that might be offered for sale, and for which he
     was paid so much per pound for his trouble.
     A large part of the cotton imported was offered for sale at
      auction. Here are a few announcements :
        To be sold by aiiction, at George's Coffee House, on April loth, 1784,
      at eleven in the forenoon, 133 bags and 278 pockets of fine St. Domingo
       cotton. The cotton lies in Mr. Blundell's warehouse, Covent Garden,
      where it may be viewed, and samples will be laid out in the saleroom the
     day before the sale.—George Dunbar, broker.
        To be sold, at the office of Thomas Ryan, in Exchange Alley, on

        The foregoing are taken at random from Williamson^s Advertiser,
       Similar announcements occur very frequently. The greater
      number of the sales were by Mr. George Dunbar, who did a
      much larger business than any of the other brokers.
        The George's Coffee House referred to above stood a few
       doors from Water Street on the west side of Castle Street, at that
       time a very narrow thoroughfare ; [the] north-west corner being
       opposite the door of the Town Hall, then called the Exchange. The
      Exchange Alley mentioned as containing the offices or counting-
       houses of Mr. George Dunbar, Mr. Thomas Eyan, and Mr.
      Andrew Aikin, was situated behind Castle Street, with an
       entrance in Water Street, somewhere about the present Lower
       Castle Street. Immediately below was ["] The Talbot ["] Coaching
       House, with stables in Fenwick Street. The Exchange (Town
        Hall), 'since considerably altered and enlarged, was not then a
       detached edifice as it is now. Buildings abutted upon [it] on both
       the west and north sides. The south side fronted Water [Street^]
      and the east side High Street, which thoroughfare started
       opposite the end of Castle Street, and came out in Tithebarn
       Street opposite the end of Oldhall Street. Next door to the
       Exchange, in Water Street, was the shop of a barber and wig
      maker of the name of Blackstock. Immediately below were the
                            Behind Exchange

     running from High Street westwards, and about in a line with
     the present passage over the " Flags " from Exchange Street
     East to liumford Street, were the butchers' ["] shambles." On the
     ground now covered by the Exchange Newsroom, Brown's [Build-]
      ings, Rumford Street, and the buildings down to Covent Garden,
      Avas an assemblage of old tumble-down buildings, small streets,
      courts, alleys, and passages : some Avith entrances from Water
      Street, others from Chapel Street, and others from High Street
      via the shambles. The buildings at the front of Water Street
     and Chapel Street were of a more respectable type than those
     between the two streets. Dale Street and Water Street Avere
     both considerably narrower than they are noAV.
       The upper portion of the Exchange Avas used for municipal
     business ; the lower portion, with the open area Avhich at that
     time existed in the centre of the building, was intended for the
     use of the merchants and brokers of the day. But they preferred
     assembling outside, a custom kept up to the present day by the
     cotton trade. They congregated in the front and at the south-
      east corner of the building, opposite the ends of Castle, Dale, and
    High Streets, and, spite of several attempts made to remove them,,
     they held their ground until the opening of the neAV (now old)
    Exchange Buildings. There at high 'Change might be seen the
     Rathbones, Bensons, Tarletons, Earles, Drinkwaters, Dunbars,
     Backhouses, Crosbies, Birches, Blackburns, Blunclells, Heywoods,
      Gildarts, Branckers, Bolds, Gregsons, Laces, and Roscoes
      of those days, attired in the quaint costume of the time,
     graphically described by Brooke in his " Liverpool during the
     Last Quarter of the Eighteenth Century [":][—]"Coats cut much in
     the form of Court dress coats, often Avith stand-up collars, and
     usually Avith gilt, silvered tAvist, or basket buttons ; [waistcoats]
      of A^ery great length, of the kind called flap waistcoats, the flaps
     being large and containing pockets Avith a small cover or flap over
     each pocket, and often with ornamental basket buttons ; [short]
     breeches A\dth buckles of gold, silver, or false stones at the knees,
    and large buckles of gold or silver, or gilt or plated to resemble
     those metals, in their shoes. The coat, waistcoat, and breeches

      were often all of one colour, frequently of a light or snuff colour.
        Ruffles at the wrists and white stocks were almost invariably
         Avorn. Cocked hats were commonly used ; the kind of cocked
       hat then in fashion came to a point or peak in front, and the
        raised part of the back was higher than the sides. The young
       men, and some of the middle-aged men, wore their hair dressed
       with large curls on each side of the face, called cannon curls, and
       with queues behind, and occasionally with thick short queues
        called clubs. Wigs of various descriptions, such as tie wigs,
        cauliflower wigs, brown bob wigs, and bush wigs (with hair powder),
       were also commonly worn by middle-aged and elderly persons."
      The scene at high 'Change a hundred years ago was, therefore,
        a much more picturesque sight than at the present day, as it was
         also, no doubt, much less bustling. In 1786-7 the buildings
       round the Exchange were pulled down, and the present north
      wing was added. About the same time the buildings on the west
        side of Castle Street were pulled down and the street increased
        to its present width. The Old Exchange Alley gave place to
      Lower Castle Street. Brunswick Street was also projected.
      While these alterations were being made in Castle Street and
      Water Street, another Exchange Alley was being erected on the
         site now occupied by Brown's Buildings ; considerable changes
       were also made in Dale Street and High Street. Most of the
       merchants and brokers resided in Lord Street, Church Street,
       Clayton Scjuare, Houghton Street, and a few in Duke Street,
       then only partially built. Some of the Eathbones and Earles
        resided next to the river on the west side of the Salthouse Dock
      and many merchants resided over their own counting houses in
      Water Street, Dale Street, Castle Street, &c.
        The increased supply of cotton to meet the requirements of
       the new spinning machinery then rajDidly coming into operation
        led to largely augmented imports, and Liverpool, instead of being
        •only second in importance as a cotton emporium, soon took the
         lead. As late as 1789 London stood first with an import of
       48,000 bales, against 47,000 received at Liverpool. In 1790 to
       1792 Liverpool took the lead; lost it in 1793 and 1794; but

                      171
     recovered it again in 1795, and kept it ever after. With more
     cotton there was room for more brokers, and more work was
     available for the firms already in existence. Mr. Joshua Holt
    came in for so fair a share of this increased business that he
    was able to abandon his original calling, and instead of being a
     " Broker and Staymaker," he became a " Cotton Broker " only.
    Somewhere between 1785 and 1789 Mr. Holt took into partner-
     -ship a Mr. Davies, and the firm became Holt and Davies,
     at the old premises in Moor Street and Old Eopery. Meanwhile
    Mr. Nicholas Waterhouse, Messrs. Ewart and Rutson, Mr.
     "William Peers, Mr. Thomas Tattersall, and Mr. Edgar Corrie
    commenced business. These were subsequently (1795 to 1800)
     followed by Mr. Richard Dobson, Mr. Joseph Greaves, and
     Messrs. Thomas and Isaac Littledale.
      The commercial rendezvous was still at the top of Castle
     Street, in front of the ToAvn Hall, which edifice, after the fire
    which in 1795 destroyed the whole of the interior, had undergone
     considerable alterations. The open area in the inside had been
     clone away with, and the externals of the building had been
     greatly improved by the erection of the present dome and other
     additions. Moreover, the association of the building with com-
    merce had been severed, and its name altered from that of ["] The
    Exchange ["] to that of "The Town Hall." The change of name,
    however, had no influence upon the merchants and brokers of the
     day, who still insisted upon congregating on the spot which had
    been the meeting-place of their mercantile forefathers ; and this
    notwithstanding the complaints constantly made that they were
    more or less obstructing the thoroughfare, to say nothing of their
    inconveniencing the neighbouring tradesmen by sheltering in the
    shop door-ways on wet days. Two years before the fire, the Mayor
    had complied with the request that the lower portion of certain
     buildings at the back of the Town Hall might be used as a place
     of meeting for the merchants, instead of the " flags " in Castle
     Street Q), but the movement came to nothing, although the
                   ( ' ) We[ are][ desired][ to][ inform][ the][ public,][ that][ the][ petition][ to][ the][ Mayor]
     .and Council, for the appropriation of the lower part of the new building on

        requisition to the Mayor was signed by a number of the mer-
        chants themselves. It was seen, however, that this state of things
        could not be allowed to exist much longer, and a movement was
        started for the erection of a new Exchange. The scheme,
         originally proposed by Roscoe, was promptly taken up by
          capitalists. The foundation-stone was laid in 1803, and the
        building was opened to the public in 1808. Monday, the 7th
       March of that year, says Billinge's Advertiser—
         Was a day of much importance in the commercial annals of Liverpool,
          as on that day the merchants abandoned their usual place of meeting, at
         the upper end of Castle Street, and assembled for the first time in the
        grand area of the new Exchange. No place in the world affords so elegant
        and commodioiis a situation as this for the purposes of a public exchange,
        and we have often been surprised to hear it observed that it would be
           difficult to bring the merchants to abandon their old situation to which they
        were so much attached by the strong ties of habit and early prepossesion. In
         opposition to this comnaou opinion, we are happy to observe that the trans-
          lation was absolutely perfect the first day, not a single person being found
          loitering about his old haunts during the whole 'Change hours.
         Ten months later was opened what was at first called the
       Commercial Room, but afterwards the Ncavs Room.
         With the new Exchange came new faces. In addition to
        the Rathbones, Bensons, Tarletons, Dunbars, Earles, and others
        already mentioned in this chapter, there were noAV the Croppers^
        Brockebanks, Boltons, Bullins, Aspinalls, Cardwells, Gladstones,
       Houghtons, Lodges, Mosses, Myerses, Neilsons, Parrs, Sand-
        baches, Tobins, Williamsons, Molyneuxes, Yateses, and others,
        not to forget Pudsey Dawson and Francis Jordan. These would
         the north side of the Exchange to the use of the merchant, &c., met [with]
         a most favourable reception, and being referred to the vSelect Committee,
         was, at their last meeting recommended to be immediately carried into
              efi'ect. The merchants and others, whose business renders a daily [attend-]
         ance on 'Change necessary, may therefore soon expect to have a most
        commodious and elegant place to meet in ; as this room, in addition to, and
          in connexion with, the present side-walks and area, which we [understand][ is]
          to be covered with a dome, will form a suite of conv^eniences admirably
         adapted to the purpose, and equal, if not superior, to anything [of] the kind
          in Europe. The immediate attention of the gentlemen[ of] the Council of
          the Select Committee to this request, and their [liberal] [compliance][ with][ it,]
             is a striking proof of their wish to coincide with the sense, and to forward
        whatever appears conducive to public utility. — Williamson's Advertiser,
        February ISth, 1793.

          CHAPTER II.
        THE COTTON MARKET IN THE PRESENT CENTURY.
         Introduction of the custom of buying cotton by sample instead of by actual
            inspection of the bulk : the innovation at first opposed. —Spinners whO'
           formerly bought from dealers in Manchester and elsewhere begin to
           purchase through brokers in Liverpool : the movement unsuccessfully
           opposed by the dealers, many of whom became brokers.—Establishment
             of the custom for buying brokers to have samples sent to their own
              offices instead of buying off the counters of the sellers. —The sellers
           hold a meeting and object to [this] custom[ ;] biit are eventually over-ruled
          by the buyers. —Earliest attempts to collect the statistics of imports,
              sales, &c. —The first monthly report started by Ewart and Rutson in
            1787.—This became weekly in 1805. —The first exclusively weekly
           cotton circular started by Mr. Samuel Hope in 1805.— The first really
                        ' complete and authentic stock-taking not accomplished till 1811 : this
          was the beginning of associated effort.—The first associated circular,
            called the ["] General Circular," issued in 18.32, which was subscribed to
          by sixteen firms.—The cotton brokers met weekly in the offices of
            certain firms who, turn about, undertook to collect the sales. —This
           suggested the establishment of the Liverpool Cotton Brokers' Association
            in 1841.—Names of the ninety firms contained in the first muster roll.
     —The first President.—The first Secretary.—The weekly meetings
          removed to the Cotton Sales -room, and finally to Brown's Buildings.[—]
         The method of collecting the sales unchanged. —The first and only
           hitch in connection with the collecting of the sales. —The first associated
          weekly cotton circular commenced in 1864. —Followed by the daily,
           annual, and other reports.
      Towards the close of the last century the increased demand
        for cotton had led to a greatly extended cultivation of the plant
        in the West Indies and the Brazils, but, above all, in the United
        States, where the invention of the saw-sin had established a new

```

```
      era, so to speak, in the industry. With the extended cultivation
    came a more careful system of selection and jDacking. In this
    way it became possible to offer the imports in' even running lots
    by sample, and the custom of selling by sample shown on a
     counter was established. This innovation (first proposed by Mr.
    Robert Gill) was at the outset stoutly opposed by the majority of
     the brokers, on the ground that the dealers and spinners would
    be able to purchase direct from the importer, without the inter-
     vention of a broker. As a matter of fact, however, the interests
     of the brokers were not in the least affected. They did their
    work in less time and with less trouble than before, and although
     the customary brokerage was now fixed at I per cent, for selling,
    and the same for buying, the smaller rate of remuneration was
    more than counterbalanced by the increased business done, and
    by the greater amount of work which could be got through in a
     given space of time than formerly. Both seller and buyer found
       it to be more to his advantage to employ a broker rather than to
     deal direct : the " seller, because the broker, by virtue of his
     occupation, could more readily find a market than he could him-
      self ; [and][ the buyer,][ because][ the][ broker,][ by][ being] always on the
     spot, and ever on the look out for the article required by his
      client, could more easily find what was wanted, when it was
    wanted, than could the buyer himself.
       This was at the commencement of the present century, by
    which time the business had become extensive enough to support
     a number of both purely selling and |)urely buying brokers, in
     addition to some who both bought and sold. The buying brokers
    had originally been brought into existence by dealers who in
     those days were the principal buyers; but one or two had been
     started by spinners whose joint requirements Avere sufficient to-
    support an agent here, and who found it more advantageous to
    purchase through a broker here than from a dealer in Manchester.
    Some of the dealers were in a very large way of business, and
   many of them imported extensively on their own account. They
     were, in point of fact, merchants. Some of the firms kept up a
    stock of several thousand bales of various growths and qualities^

       and the spinners made their purchases after inspecting the actual
         bales or bags in the warehouses at Manchester. As the size of
        the mills and the means of the owners increased, the spinners
        turned their eyes towards [Liverpool,] naturally concluding that if
        they purchased there, from the importers, they would secure for
        themselves the profit hitherto gained by the dealer. This gave
          rise to the establishment [of][ a][ greatly][ increased][ number][ of] buying
         brokers, from about[ the][ year][ 1810][ downwards,][ but][ especially][ after]
        the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The
       movement was for some time strongly opposed by the dealers,
       who, shortly after [a] [number][ of][ spinners][ had][ set][ up][ several][ brokers]
        to represent them in Liverpool, held a meeting in Manchester,
       and resolved neither [to] buy[ from,][ nor][ to][ deal][ with,][ any][ broker][ in]
        Liverpool who sold [to][ the] [newly-][ established][ buying][ houses.] But
         this opposition melted away before the determination of the
        spinners to retain the advantages which they had gained by
       buying in the larger [market,][ where] sellers were more numerous,
       and the competition [to][ sell][ more][ open,][ than][ was][ the][ case][ in][ Man-]
         chester. Gradually, therefore, the number of brokers increased,
        while the number of dealers diminished. Some of the new
        brokers were relatives of spinners, some were connections of
         dealers, while many were dealers themselves, Avho, having the
       wisdom to see that a new[ departure][ was][ at][ hand,][ quickly] adapted
        themselves to the altered circumstances of the times, by com-
       mencing to act as brokers instead of operating as dealers—by
       buying for their clients instead of selling to them. In this way
       they started with a [connection] already in hand, and one which
       they or their descendants have since retained. The change, of
         course, took time, but eventually the dealer was almost extin-
        guished. In 1815 there were upwards of one hundred cotton
       merchants or dealers in Manchester, and there were many more
        besides in the leading towns in the spinning and manufacturing
         districts ; but from that date the numbers[ gradually][ diminished,]
        while the number of brokers [gradually][ increased,][ until][ a] complete
        revolution had been effected, and the term cotton dealer became
        associated with an entirely different class of men from that to

                      177
      With the new order of things there was gradually introduced
      :an important change in the method of buying cotton. Hitherto,
     the practice had been for the buying broker to make his purchases
     in the saleroom of the selling broker, but by and by it became the
     custom for the buying broker to have the samples sent to his own
     buying-room for inspection before purchase. This enabled him
      to compare the samples of the various lots with each other, and
     with the sample of any previous purchase which he might be
     desirous of matching ; moreover, it enabled both broker and
     spinner to examine the cotton at leisure by a light with which
     they were familiar (a very important matter), and also to conduct
     their business without being watched by competing buyers. The
     system was never acceptable to the sellers, and, after several years
      of grumbling, they rose in rebellion against its continuance. They
      jDrotested that the buying broker, by getting in samples early in
     the day, and keeping them for several hours, frequently prevented
     the sale of the cotton, because other buyers had no opportunity
      of seeing the lot ; and that the careless manner in which the
     samples were handled, while in the possession of the buying
     broker, prejudiced the sale of the lot, and often put the seller to the
     expense of re-sampling ; and they were determined to put a stop to
     the evil. Accordingly, at a meeting held on the 15th January,
     1845, in the old Cotton Salesroom, it was resolved, " That in the
     opinion of this meeting the practice of allowing samples of cotton
     to be taken from the selling brokers' office previous to sale is
     attended with great loss and inconvenience ; and that, with the
     view to remedy this evil, it is proposed that the importers of
     cotton in this port should enter into a general [resolution][ to][ instruct]
      their selling brokers not to permit samples[ placed] in their hands
     to be removed from their office [until][ after][ a][ sale][ has][ been][ effected,]
     so that all parties may have equal opportunities of inspecting
     them." This resolution, and another carrying out its recom-
     mendation, were duly passed; [the][ vigorous][ opposition][ notwith]
     standing of Mr. George Barnsley, Mr. Wm. Bower, [and][ Mr.][ James]
     H. Wrigley, who, along with [other] buying[ brokers,][ had][ attended]
     the meeting, although they were told that they had no right

                        178
        here, on the ground that the meeting was [one][ of][ importers][ only.]
      The obvious convenience [of][ the] [modern][ system,][ and][ the][ practical]
        impossibility (ovring to the [multiplication][ of][ buyers)][ of][ reverting]
        to the old method, prevented[ the][ resolutions][ passed][ at][ the][ meeting]
       from being acted upon, and at a second meeting, called on the-
       28th January, it was [resolved,] by way[ of][ compromise,][ "][ That][ in]
         lieu of the plan proposed[ in][ the][ resolutions][ passed][ at][ the][ meeting]
         of importers, held [at] this place on the 15th inst., the following
        plan be adopted, namely. That[ of][ every][ parcel][ of][ cotton][ on][ sale,]
        duplicate samples shall be drawn ; [That][ one] set of the samples
         (to be distinguished by[ a][ red] ticket and to be 'called the office
        sample) shall ahvays be retained in the office of the selling
        broker, so as to enable the [seller][ to][ exhibit][ his][ cotton][ to][ all][ buyers']
       and to give the opportunity[ to] [any][ buyer] at once to purchase the-
         parcel." This practice differed very slightly from that it waS'
        designed to supersede, and[ in][ course][ of][ time][ it][ was][ discontinued.]
         Meanwhile circumstances, [especially][ these][ in][ connection][ with]
        the collection of statistical information, had gradually led up tO'
        the establishment of the Liverpool Cotton [Brokers'][ Association.]
       During the closing years of the [last] [century][ the] transactions in
        the cotton market ranged from[ only] [about][ 200][ or][ 300][ bags,][ up][ to]
       about 2,000 or 3,000 bags, per week. The average from 1791 to
         179.5 was about 1,000, and from 1796 to 1800 about 2,000, [per]
        week. As only a few brokers were [engaged][ in][ the][ business,][ and]
         as much of the cotton was sold at auction, little difficulty was
        experienced in obtaining an account [of] what[ Avas][ going][ on.] There
       was no Brokers' Association, but there was a tacit understanding

     which, and other interesting matter, we are indebted to Mr.
     Chappie Gill, whose father, some years after the date of this,
     became a partner in the firm of Richard Dobson and Co.:
                                  Liverpool, 6th Sept., 1796.
      Mr. William Heaton, Cotton Merchant,
                 Blackbiirn,
          Sir,—In the course of this week about 700 bags of cotton have been sold
      here, consisting of Pernams at 20cl. to 25d. ; Maranhams, fair, 22^d.
      Surinams, 22-hd. ; Grenadas at 23d. Buyers—John Walker, Peter Fletcher,
      Burns, Selves, and Tattersall. I had a sale on Friday last of 210 damaged
     Bahamas, which sold very well indeed; they averaged 18d. Two ships
     have arrived from Barbadoes with 380 bags for T. Barton, one from Jamaica
     with 128 for Sydebottom and Co., and one from Cadiz with 407 bags, prin-
      cipally for A. Clegg. I am of opinion that cotton will not be lower this
      year. To-day Maranham cannot be purchased under 23d. : not above 300
      bags good in the market ; no good Pernams at all.
                    I am, for Richard Dobson and Co.,
                         Your obedient servant,
                                             C. Mawson.
      With the opening of the present century the trade increased
      in a way that greatly surprised the people of those days ; the
     imports into Liverpool rising from 92,000 bales in 1800 to an
     average of 168,000 bales in 1804-6, and to one of 250,000 in
     1809-11. This called for a more complete and more systematic
      service of statistics than had hitherto been required. Accordingly,,
      in 1805, Messrs. Ewart and Rutson commenced to issue a weekly
     account of the sales, imports, &c., of cotton. Towards the close
      of the same year Mr. Samuel Hope, who had recently commenced
     business as a cotton broker, also began to issue a weekly report.
   A few years later, somcAvhere about 1807 or 1808, Mr. J. A. Jee,
    who commenced business as a general broker in 1804 or 1805,
      also started the issue of a weekly report on cotton and other
     produce. These three firms and other brokers assisted each other
      in the collection of the necessary statistics. Mr. Hope's report^
     being devoted exclusively to cotton, was more complete in respect
      of that article than the other reports, which dealt with all kinds
      of foreign and colonial produce. It was, in fact, the first attempt
    made to systematise the statistics of the trade.
       The imports and exports were made up from the returns.

       published by the Custom-house. The stocks were ascertained at
       the end of each year by apphcation to the merchants who were
     known to have imported cotton, and to the brokers or dealers into
      whose hands some portion of the imports may have passed. For
      some years these ret;irns were very incomplete ; but at the end
        of 1811 Mr. Hope was able to announce, that "the difficulty
      which has usually attended our estimating the stocks on hand at
       the close of the yeav has, in the j^resent instance, been .overcome,
        b)y the whole of the brokers, with only one or two exceptions,
      having by common consent exchanged returns of the quantity of
      which they were res^Dectively in charge. From these returns, the
       general accuracy of which cannot be questioned, it aj^pears that
       the total [quantity] with [which] the whole of the brokers have had
      any connection [whatever] certainly does not exceed 91,000 bags.
      In addition to [this] quantity, several of the merchants, and some
      few of the [speculators,][ hold][ cottons][ on][ hand,][ which][ have][ not] been
       given in charge to any broker. On the part of these, an almost
       equally frank communication has been made, from which the
       quantity thus [held] may be[ estimated][ at][ about][ 9,000."]
        The organisation [thus] commenced[ has] since been continued,
       with such [improvements][ as][ were][ suggested,][ from][ time][ to][ time,] by
       the ever [varying][ requirements][ of][ the][ trade.] The leading brokers
        issued weekly [market][ reports.] In a few instances several brokers
       joined at a common[ circular,][ all][ using][ the][ same][ tables][ of][ statistics,]
      but each [firm][ appending][ their][ own][ Aaews][ as][ to][ the condition][ and]
       prospects of [the][ market.] The most important cotton circulars,
       besides those [of][ the][ firms][ already][ mentioned,][ issued][ between][ 1820]
      and 1840, were published by Mr. Colin Campbell, Messrs. Hol-
       linshead and[ Tetley,][ Messrs.][ Marriott][ and][ Eogers,][ and][ Mr.][ Francis]
      Haywood. The most important general circulars were those of
       Messrs. T. and [H.][ Littledale][ and][ Co.] and Mr. Daniel Buchanan.
     The [compilations] of this latter gentleman assumed gigantic pro-
       portions, and were much[ sought][ after][ by][ other][ brokers.] The first
      attempt at the production of an associated circular, on a scale
      worthy of the [name,][ was] in 1832, in which year was issued the
         first number [of] [what][ has][ since][ gone][ by][ the][ name][ of][ the][ "][ General]

      Circular," that is to say, a market report giving an [account][ of][ the]
      imports, sales, stocks, and prices current of all articles which
     custom had included under the head of foreign and colonial
      produce, including cotton, hut excluding breadstufif's and pro-
       visions. A number of brokers subscribed to this weekly[ report,][ (^)]
     but the leading firms still issued their own private circulars, and
     continued to do so for many years afterwards. The particulars
      of the business done in cotton were collected from week to week,
     turn about, by a number of firms appointed for the [purpose.] The
     number selected being sufficient to insure that no firm should
      receive more than two sets of returns in any one year. The
       selleis furnished an account of all cotton sold, but the buyers
     returned only the purchases for export or on speculation ; [the]
      balance, after deducting these two items, being put down as
      deliveries to consumers. There was no official, or associated,
     account of imports; and those firms who required these [particulars,]
      for their Aveekly market report, had either to make them up for
      themselves, from the returns published in the Customs' Daily [Bill]
      of Entry, or to obtain them from some one or other [of][ the][ brokers]
    who kept what was called an import book, which contained the
     names of all the vessels which had during the week arrived with
      cotton. Every Friday morning the brokers met together in [the]
      saleroom of the firm whose turn it was to collect the sales, and
      at this meeting the figures were called out. There was rarely
     any other business to transact, and the meetings scarcely ever
      lasted more than ten minutes.
        These weekly meetings suggested the establishment of the
     Cotton Brokers' Association, which was foimall} inaugurated on
      the 2nd Aj)ril, 1841. The first muster roll contained the names
       of ninety firms, of which eighteen, whose names in the following
        list are printed in italics, were appointed to collect, and[ to][ give]
             (^) The first subscribing brokers were : Richard Eateson tuicl Co. ;
      Buchanan and Browne; \V. P. Bushby ; Ewart, Myers, and Co. ; [Glad-]
       stone and iSerjeantson ; [Jee][ Brothers] ; [Jones,] [Mann,][ and] Foster ; [T.][ and]
      H. Littledale and Co. ; Miller, Whitaker, and Bathbone ; Molyneux,
       Taylor, and Co. ; Percival, Farton, and Booth ; Priestley, Griffiths, and
      Cox; Boscow and Rigg ; Salisbury, Turner, [and][ Earle] ; yhand and Horsfall;
      and Nicholas Waterhouse and Sons.

       From April, 1841, until February, 1842, there was no
      President, nor was there any Committee of Management. The
      •chair at each weekly meeting was taken by a member of the
      firm whose turn it was to collect the sales, and in whose saleroom
      the meeting Avas held. But on the 22nd January, 1842, at a
     meeting held at the office of Messrs. Godfrey Barnsley and
      Son, Mr. Barnsley in the chair, it was proposed by Mr. Clare
      .and seconded by Mr. Gill, "That in order to the better
      •definition of the Cotton Brokers' Association, it is indispensable
      that its members be regularly enrolled and that a Committee
     of Management be appointed." The majority of the members,
     however, took a more modest, though less far-seeing, view of
      the functions of the Association than did Messrs. Clare and
       Gill, and they passed the following amendment, proposed by
     Mr. Wrigley and seconded by Mr. Ryley : "That it is the opinion
     of this meeting that, as the transactions in the cotton trade in
      this town have heretofore been so much to the general satisfaction,
        it is inexpedient to make any other alteration in the constitution
      of the Cotton Brokers' Association than the annual election of a
      President and Vice-President, to whom all communications from
     other associated mercantile bodies shall be addressed, and whose
      .business it shall be to bring such communications before the
      general body, and that the election of President and Vice-President
     be by ballot, each individual firm having a vote." A vote of
     thanks was then passed to the Chairman, who brought the pro-
      ceedings to a close by requesting each firm to send in to Messrs.
     Richard Bateson and Sons, on or before the 28th January, the
     names of the gentlemen they desired to propose as President and
      Vice-President". This was done; and on the date named, Mr.
     Bateson announced that the choice of President had fallen upon
     Mr. George Holt, and that of Vice-President upon Mr. James
     Wrigley, by large majorities. The post of President was then,
      as subsequently, one of distinction and honoiir, but it carried
     with it none of the hard work and great responsibilities attached
      to the position in later years. The first Secretary (quite an
     honorary office at that time and for some years later) was

       Mr. Studley Martin, who, with undiminished activity and ever
        increasing popularity, still worthilj^ fills the post.
        As a further step towards putting the Association on a sound
      and lasting basis, Messrs. Clare and Gill, at a meeting held at the
         office of Messrs. Isaac Cooke and Sons on the 18th February,
       1842, brought forward the following resolution: "That as the
        rule Avith regard to the admission of members to this Association
          i3 not sufficiently explicit, it be from henceforth understood that
      no individual shall be admitted a member of the Association unless
       he shall have served an apprenticeship as a broker in an office
      where the cotton brokerage business is carried on, or have been in
       business at this port for three years at the least as a cotton broker,
      and unless such individual shall be proposed and seconded in the
       usual manner after one week's notice having been given, and the
       meeting generally by a majority thereof approves him as a
      member." This resolution was carried unanimously; as was also
       the following resolution proposed by Mr. Clare and seconded by
      Mr. Ryley : "That in future no individual shall have a right of
      membership in consequence of his being taken into partnership
      by any existing membsr, and that those individuals only (being
        principals) who have the management of the cotton department
        in concerns carrying on business as general brokers, are eligible
        as members, being duly elected, or being already members of
       the Association." These resolutions were [acted] [upon][ until][ the]
      amalgamation of the Association with the Cotton Exchange.
       Prior to 1845 no admission fees had been paid by any one[ joining]
       the Association, but on the 14th February of that year at a
       meeting held at the office of Messrs. Whitaker, Carter, and Co.,
          it was proposed by Mr. D. C. Buchanan, seconded by Mr. George
       Comer, and resolved, "That in future an [admission] fee be j)aid
      by each individual on his joining the associated body[ of][ Cotton]
       Brokers. Such fee to be ten guineas for any [individual] [who][ has]
       served an apprenticeship of five years to a cotton broker (a
      member of the Association), and twenty guineas [for] [any][ individual]
       admitted without such quahfication." Some years later these-
        fees were altered to five guineas and fifty guineas respectively.

       Some years after the formation of the Association, when the
    members became too numerous to be accommodated in the sale-
     rooms of the brokers, it was decided to hold the weekly meetings
      in the Cotton Sales-room, in the east wing of the old Exchange
      Buildings, afterwards, when these were being pulled down, in the
     Public Sales-room in the west wing, and, finally, in one of the
     rooms taken by the Association in Brown's Buildings. The
     method of obtaining the sales remained unchanged. About thirty
      firms of brokers collected the weekly returns in rotation, and a
    member of the firm whose turn it was to make up the figures
      called them out at the meeting. The same method was adopted
      at the periodical stock-takings. The system was kept up until
     within a few years' since, when the duty was transferred to the
      Secretary, or rather to Mr. Martin's coadjutor, Mr. Peter Brown.
     For a while the members who formerly collected the figures
     attended to assist in the making up of the tables, but, eventually,
      this last relic of the old custom sank into a mere matter of form,
     and the work was left entirely in the hands of the Secretary
      (Mr. Brown) and his assistants.
       During the forty years of the separate existence of the
     Cotton Brokers' Association the only hitch that occurred in con-
      nection with the collection of the weeklj^ sales took place in
      1849. The following explanation of the incident is from Messrs.
     Fairclough and Chinn's report, dated March 2nd, 1849 :
     We regret that we are unable to publish our iisual Weekly Cotton
       Circular, with account of imports, sales, stocks, &c., owing to a dispute
      between two of the leading firms in this town. As the facts of the case
     may prove interesting to our friends, we do not hesitate to give the full
       particulars. They are as follow :—
         Messrs. T. and H. Littledale and Co. some weeks past tendered a i)ay-
     ment for cotton to Messrs. Miles Barton and Bigland, a few minutes after
      the usual time for i-eceiving payments, which the[ latter] refused, as [the][ rule]
      agreed to by the Cotton Brokers' Association was to the eii'ect that all
      payments should be made not later than half-past t'wo o'clock.
       The matter in dispute was referred to the weekly meeting of the
       brokers, when Messrs. Littledale and Co. were requested to settle the pay-
     ment in accordance with the rule before alluded to, which was complied
      with apparently unwillingly, as they (Messrs. Littledale and Co.) imme-
      diately gave notice of their intention to withdraw from the Association,

                        186
       and have since refused to fu.rnish an account of their sales during the week
       and the quantity purchased by them on speculation, which is required from
          all brokers, in order to ascertain the stock of cotton in this port.
          This has caused considerable inconvenience and no little unpleasant-
         ness, as the total amount of sales during the week could not be made up.
         It was proposed to-day at the weekly meeting, after a long and animated
         discussion, in order to arrive at the actual amount of business ti'ansacted
         diiring the week, that each broker should make a return to the Chairman
        of all purchases made during the week from Messrs. Littledale and Co.,
       and thereby a tolerably correct statement could be shewn. But to this
        proposition Messrs. John Wrigley and Son refused to comply ; and, in con-
        sequence, it was determined by a large majority, that, rather than give an
        imperfect statement, it would be better not to furnish any account at all
       beyond an estimate.
        The matter was satisfactorily arranged during the course
       of the succeeding week, by an official extension of the time
        fixed for the latest receipt of payments to a quarter to thi-ee
        o'clock instead of half-past two, and everything afterwards went
      on smoothly.
       Down to 1864, the leading firms continued to issue weekly
      market reports ; [but][ in][ that][ year][ the][ Association][ commenced][ the]
       publication of an associated circular. This was followed in the
      same year by the Daily Table of sales and imports, which, in
       1874, was succeeded by the present more complete Daily Circular.
     To these publications were at various times added the Annual
       report issued in December, the American Crop report issued in
       September, and the daily advices by cable from America, issued
       every morning.

         CHAPTER III.
     GLEANINGS AND llEMINISCENCES ABOUT OLD COTTON
          BROKERS AND THEIR OFFSHOOTS.
    What may be termed the commercial geiaealogy of the great bulk of the
       members of the Cotton Brokers' Association can, directly [or][ indirectly,]
        be traced back, either through partnerships or apprenticeships, to
        houses established during either the closing years [of][ the] last century,
         or the opening years of the present one. Accordingly, in the following
        gleanings and reminiscences each section consists mostly[ of][ an][ account]
         of one or more of these old firms and its, or their, various direct and
         indirect offshoots.
                                  I.
      As already stated in the previous chapter, one[ of][ the][ earliest]
     brokers connected with the cotton trade was Mr. George [Dimbar,]
    who commenced business, as a general broker somewhere about
     1775. At that time he resided in Tarleton Street, and his office
    was in the old Exchange Alley, behind Castle Street. One of
      his apprentices was Mr. William Ewart, the son of a Scotch
     Presbyterian Minister ; another was Mr. William Eutson, [son][ of]
     Mr. Eutson, of the old firm of Backhouse and Eutson, [African]
     merchants, founded by Mr. John Backhouse, somewhere about
     1750. At the close of his apprenticeship, Mr. Ewart [commenced]
     business on his own account. In 1787 he was joined by his
     fellow-apprentice, Mr. Eutson, and the firm of Ewart and Eutson
    was established. The new firm very shortly took a leading
     position on 'Change, and eventually virtually succeeded to the
     business of their late master, who for many years was the most
     extensive broker in Liverpool. He continued in business for
     several years after the establishment of the firm of Ewart and
     Eutson, and, in 1796, was Mayor of Liverpool; but when, by
     the death of a distant relative (at the opening of the present

                        188
        century), he succeeded to the family baronetcy, and thereby
      became Sir George Dunbar, he retired from business. " The
       pride of ancestry," says the author of "Liverpool a few years
        since," (published thirty years ago by the Eev. James Aspinall,
      under the non de plume of " An Old Stager")— " The pride of
       ancestry was stronger than the pride of the merchant prince
       within him, and he retired from vulgar trade, cut hogsheads and
      rum puncheons, and was no more seen on 'the Eialto' discussing
       markets and inquiring the price of barilla and pearlashes. It was
        a false move on the part of the worthy barcnet. No rank would
       have been sullied by remaining in the firm of which he was the
        head. His junior paitners, Ewart and Rutson, became not only
       eminent, but pre-eminent, amongst our giants of that day, and
       achieved a name and reputation known to the ends of the earth."
      But although Messrs. Ewart and Rutson may, to all intents and
        purposes, have eventually succeeded to the business of Sir George
       Dunbar, they were not his partners. The two firms existed
       independently, side by side, for a number of years ; [and][ although]
        their counting-houses were both in Exchange Alley, the on©
       (George Dunbar's) was at No. 7, and[ the] other at No. 3, and for
        a short time after Sir George's retirement (until somewhere about
       1805) the business was continued by his son.
          In the year ISOO the style of Ewart and Rutson was altered
        to Ewart, Rutson, and Co., on the admission to partnership of
       Mr. William Myers, son of Mr. John Myers, the eminent
       merchant, who for a number of years was a neighbo'ur of the
       Rutsons in Houghton Street. On the 30th April, 181.5, Mr.
      Rutson (^) retired, but no change was made in the' style of
        the firm until the 30th April, 1816, when it was altered to
               (1) Mr. E,utson was godfather to Rutson, third son to Mr. James Maury?
        who, in 1783, on the recognition of the independence of the colonies by the
        mother country, was appointed first United States Consul to Liverpool.
        This fact is mentioned because Mr. Rutson Maury was for many j'ears a
         leading statistical authority in the cotton trade, first in Liverpool as partner
          in his father's linn of James Maury and Sons, and finally in New York as
         senior partner of the firm of Maury and Co. He died only last year (1884)
         at the ripe old age of 76, and to the last kept up a voluminous statistical
         corresfiondence with his old Liverpool friends, by whom he was held in the
         highest regard.

     p]wart, Myers, and Co. In the meantime, Mr. William Taylor,
    who had been brought up in the firm, had been taken into
     partnership. Mr. John Ewart, son of the senior, was admitted
     a partner on the same day that the style of the firm was
     altered. Simultaneously with the change in LiA'^erpool, a London
     firm was started under the style of Ewart, Taylor, and Co. The
     partners now consisted of Messrs. William Ewart, William Myers,
    William Taylor, and John Ewart. In 1823 Mr. William EAvart,
    the founder of the firm, died (^). A short time previously to
      this, Mr. Joseph Christopher Ewart (another of the founder's
     sons) had been taken into partnership. Mr. John E^vart retired
    ,somewhere about 1832, and Mr. Joseph C. Ewart Avithdrew in
     1838. Somewhere about the latter date Mr. John Myers and
    Mr. Jaques Myers, sons of Mr. William Myers (-), were taken
     into partnership, and in 1839 these three constituted the firm of
    Ewart, Myers, and Co. In 1848 Mr. John Myers retired, leai'ing
    only Mr. Jaques Myers, and the style of the firm was, altered to
    Jaques Myers and Co. In 1853 Mr. Myers took into partnership
    Mr. J. B. Thomson, Avho had served an apprenticeship Avith
     Messrs. Gladstone and Serjeantson. In 1855 Mr. Myers retired,
    and the style of the firm Avas changed to J. B. Thomson and Co.
    In 1863 Mr. Thomson took into partnershij) Mr. Charles D.
     BroAvn, and these tAvo now constitute the firm of J. B. Thomson
    and Co.(^) Mr. Jaques Myers Avas President of the Cotton
     Brokers' Association in 1853, Mr, Thomson held that important
      IDOst in 1874 and 1875.

           (2) Messrs. John and James Myers, brothers of Mr. William Myers, of
     Ewart, Rutson, and Co., commenced iDusiness as brokers in 1810, with a
     counting-house in Houghton Place, Water Street. In 1813 they remoA^ed
      to Hargreave's Buildings, High Street. In 1816 they were in Exchange
      TJuildings, and the style of their firm was John, James, and Joseph Myers.
     In 1818 there remained only John and Joseph in the firm, and the office was
     in Water Street. There was no change until 1828, when Mr. John K.
    Myers was alone, at the same office, where he continued to carry on the
      lousiness of a broker until about thirty years ago. Mr. J. K. Myers was
     the father of Mr. John Myers, late a partner iu the firm of Molyneux,
     Taylor, and Co.

         Mr. Ewart's eldest son, William, was member for Liverpool
       between 1830 and 1837. He had never been connected with
       commerce, but, after graduating at Oxford, had been called to
       the bar. In his first contest [(for][ the] vacancy [caused] by[ the] death
         of Mr. Huskisson) he was pitted against Mr. Denison (subse-
          ciuentl)'- Speaker of the House of the House of Commons). In
        those days [bribery] [was][ openly][ practised][ by][ both][ political][ parties;]
       and in this [respect][ this] particular contest is not likely to be for-
        gotten. The prices paid for votes ranged from <£5 to £40 ; [but]
       one voter on [Mr.][ Ewart's][ side] received £50, and another on M7-.
       Denison's side [got][ £80.] The total expenses were £65,000 on
       Mr. Ewart's side, and £50,000 on Mr. Denison's. Mr. Ewart
        lost his seat in 1837, being[ defeated][ by][ Mr.][ Cresswell-Cresswell.]
     He subsequently, for several years, represented Ne^vark. His
        brother, Mr. [Joseph][ C.][ Ewart,][ was][ an][ unsuccessful][ candidate][ for]
       Liverpool in [1852,] [but][ was][ victorious][ in][ 1855,][ and][ again][ in][ 1857,]
       but lost his seat in 1865, being [defeated] by [Mr.] S. E. Graves.
        Sir James [Picton,] in his " Memorials of Liverpool," tells a good
        story of how, [in][ 1831,][ Mr.][ John][ Ewart][ narrowly][ escaped][ being]
        knic^hted. There was a [general][ desire][ to][ get][ up][ some][ festivities]
        in connection with the Coronation of King WiUiam IV, and
      Queen Adelaide ; but the Corporation [showed][ no][ disposition][ to]
      move in the matter. A meeting was, therefore, called to see
      what steps [could][ be][ taken][ to][ make][ up][ for] the official deficiency ;
      and a [deputation][ was] appointed to wait upon the Mayor (Mr.
      Thomas [Brancker)][ "requesting][ him] to call a meeting, to consult
       the inhabitants as to the best mode of expressing their loyal
        feehno's [;"] but he declined to comply, on the ground that the
       deputation [presented][ something] of a party appearance. He gave
       the same answer to a requisition signed by about a hundred
        respectable [names.] The upshot was[ that][ an][ open-air][ meeting][ was]
        called in [Clayton][ Square,][ at][ which][ a][ congratulatory][ address][ to][ the]
      King and [Queen][ was][ adopted.] Meanwhile, the Mayor and Council
      had voted [a][ similar][ address][ from][ the][ Corporation][ as][ representing]
       the town. The two [addresses][ were][ sent][ up][ to][ London][—][the][ public]
       one in charge [of][ Mr.][ Ewart,][ and][ the][ Corporation][ one][ in][ charge][ of]

     the Mayor (Mr. Brancker), Mr. Alderman Bourne, and Sir George
     Drinkwater. "Mr. Ewart, with the town's address, was first in
     the field. As he knelt to present it, the King seized the Royal
     sword, and was about to confer the honour of knighthood on him,
     under the impression that he was the Mayor of Liverpool. Mr.
     Ewart, seeing the sword suspended, exclaimed hastily, ' Not me ;
     don't knight me !' on which the King asked, ' Why, which is the
    Mayor of Liverpool f and was informed that his worship was
     behind. The scene caused considerable amusement. The Mayor
     and bailiffs were then introduced by Lord Melbourne, and the
     accolade was given in due form to the Mayor, who rose Sir
    Thomas Brancker."
       One of Mr. William Ewart's strongest political supporters
     during the stirring times which preceded the passage of the first
    Reform Bill (of which Mr. Ewart became an energetic advocate)
     was Mr. John Taylor, who, along with his brother Richard,
     had commenced business as cotton broker in 1821, but who since
     1826 had been by himself. He was commonly called ["] Philosopher
     John [;"] for besides being an active politician, both as writer and
      speaker, he was also noted as a poet and as an astronomer. He was
     the first to [propose][ the][ erection] of an Observatory in Liverpool,
     and out of [this][ suggestion][ originated][ the][ present] establishment at
     Bidston Hill. He was one of the original members of the Cotton
     Brokers' Association, and continued in business until his death,
     which occurred in 1857. [(^)]
        Mr. Colin Campbell, founder of the firm of Colin Campbell,
      Son, 'and Co., was brought up in the counting-house of Messrs.
     Ewart and Rutson. He commenced business on his own account
      early in the [present][ century,][ but][ this][ did][ not][ prevent][ an][ arrange-]

     intend the balancing of Messrs. Ewart and Rutson's books.

      who, after serving an apprenticeship witli Messrs. Mari'iott and Co., was
         vs^ith Mr. Taylor about [twelve][ months][ before] ]iis death. Mr. Hutchinson
     commenced business on his own accoiint in 1857. After a while he took
       into partnership his cousin, [Mr.] W.[ H.][ Hutchinson.] The style of the firm is-

       covered with small cottages) at[ t"he] top of [Hackin's][ Hey,][ Avhich][ is]
          still in the possession of his grandsons. His son, Mr. John
       Campbell, retired in 1861, and died in 1883, aged 82. The
        business of the firm is now conducted by Mr. Thomas Stretch
      (who became a [partner][ in] 1849) and Mr. Herbert CamiDbell (son
        of Mr. John[ Campbell),][ who][ became][ a.][ partner][ in][ 1854.(^)]
         Mr. Wm. Bower also was [brought][ up][ in][ the][ house][ of][ Ewart,]
       Rutson, and Co. On completing his apprenticeship, in 1816, he
      was taken into [partnership][ by][ Mr.][ John][ Kearsley.] The style of
       the firm was [Kearsley][ and][ Bower.] Mr. Kearsley had been in
        business as a merchant[ since][ the][ opening][ of][ the][ century,][ and][ was]
        at first in partnership with Mr. John Francis Muller and Mr.
      John Malonek [(who][ was][ Consul][ for] Prussia), under the style of

      Haywood's Yard, Gradwell Street. A few years later Mr.

      The firm remained[ Kearsley,] Muller, and Co. until 1815 ; [mean-]
       while Mr. Muller had[ died.] In 1816, as already stated, the style .
        of the firm [became][ Kearsley][ and][ Bower.] The}'^ were still called
       merchants, though Mr. [Bower][ himself] Avas denominated a cotton
        broker. Mr. Kearsley, who at the opening of the century had
        resided at [Ford,] near Litherland, had removed to Speke Hall,
       and Mr. BoAver [resided][ in][ Nash][ Grove,][ then][ only] partiallj^ built
       upon, and [almost out][ in][ the] country. In 1818 the office Avas in
       Tarleton Buildings, Rumford Street. A few years later the
        partnership was dissolved. Mr. Kearsley took into partnership
               (^) Mr. Charles [H.] [Cox][ (Cox][ and][ Elliott)][ served][ an][ apprenticeship][ with]

     John Kearsley and Son, brokers. Mr. Bower then started a
      separate firm in his own name in Exchange Street East. By and
     by the style of the firm became William Bower and Son, on the
      admission of Mr. William Bower, jun., and there has not since
     been any change. The present partners are Mr. Alfred Bower
      (admitted in 1841) and his son, Mr. Harold Lance Bower (ad-
      mitted in 1870), son and grandson of the founder of the firm.(^)
     Mr. Wm. Bower, jun., was President of the Cotton Brokers'
      Association in 1853.
       The firm of John Kearsle_y and Son remained without change
      until 1848, in which year the only remaining member took into
      partnership Mr. Joseph Hadwen, and the style was altered to
      Kearsley and Hadwen. Mr. Samuel Kearsley had a taste for
      cotton statistics, and his weekly circulars were very ably compiled,
     and very tersely written. For a number of years the other
      brokers depended chiefly on him for an account of the quantity
      of cotton afloat to insert in their circulars. His information on
        all other statistical points was also in continual recjuest, and was
      freely imparted to those who asked for it. On the retirement of
     Mr. Hadwen the style of the firm was altered to Samuel Kearslej^
     and Co. In 1861 Mr. Harold Cunningham—brought up in the
     house of Buchanan and Browne—was taken into partnership,
     and the style was altered to Kearsley and Cunningham, and has
            (^) Mr. James Cunningham served his apprenticeshijD with Mr. William
      Bower. He was then for a short time with Mr. John Coupland, merchant.
      In 1834 he commenced business as a cotton broker, along with Mr. James
       Sorley, under the style of Cunningham and Sorley. This partnership was
       dissolved in 1837, and Mr. Cunningham was joined by Mr. Isaac Worth-
       ington, who had influential connections in the manufacturing districts.
     The style of the lirm was Worthington and Cunningham. In June, 1845,
      Mr. ^A'orthington became a member of the Stock Exchange, and Mr.
     Cunningham continued the business on his own account until the following
      November, when he was joined by Mr. Robert Hinshaw, and the firm took
      the style of Cunningham and Hinshaw, which it has since retained.
      Mr. Danson Cunningham and Mr. H. H. Bardswell became partners in
       1863. Mr. James Wilkie was admitted in 1867. Mr. Cunningham died
       in 1871. Mr. Hinshaw retired, and his nephew, Mr. J. B. Hinshaw, was
      admitted in 1882. Mr. Adam Moffat was brought up in the house of
      William Bower and Son. He, along with his brothers Thomas and William,
     commenced business as cotton brokers in 1864, under the style of Moffat
       Brothers. He retired from the firm in 1869, went out to the United
       States, and established himself there as a commission merchant.

        since remained without change. Mr. Kearsley retired some time
        ago, and died a few years since. The present members of the
       firm are Mr. Harold Cunningham, his brother Mr. W. Cunningham,
       Mr. Eobert Brace Higgins, and Mr.[ E.] [Hacking.]
         Another of Ewart, Kutson and Co.'s apprentices was Mr.
      Thomas Rogers, who, in 1821, [entered][ into][ partnership][ with][ Mr.]
      John Marriott; formerly a partner in the house of Messrs. John
       Eisher and Co , [cotton] merchants, of Manchester. The style of
       the firm was Marriott and Rogers, and the house soon took a
       leading position in the market. Mr. Rogers retired in 1840, and
       the style was altered to John Marriott and Co. Between 1844
      and 1848, during Avhich period Mr. Joseph Bramwell was a
        partner, the style was Marriott and Co. On the retirement of
       Mr. Bramwell, in 1848, Mr. Joseph Leather (who had served an
       apprenticeship with the firm) was admitted a partner. Mr.
        Marriott, who was always held in exceptional esteem by his
        fellow brokers, was in 1844 elected the third President of the
        Association. He retired from business in 1867. Meanwhile his
        son, Mr. William Maniott, had been made a partner. In 1879
       there was a dissolution of partnership. Mr. Leather retired, and
       Mr. William Marriott continued the business under the style of
       William Marriott and Co., taking into [partnership] Mr.[ G. A.][ Holt,]
       Mr. G. W. Irvine, and Mr. W. F. Leather, who had[ all] been brought
      up in the firm.(^) Mr. Fletcher Rogers (Rogers and Calder), son
        of Mr. Thomas Rogers, was brought up [in][ the] house[ of] [Marriott]

                                II.
        In 1782 Mr. Nicholas Waterhouse commenced business as
         :a cotton broker. He resided with his father, Mr. Ellythorpe
     Waterhouse, at 28, Pool Lane, now called South Castle Street,
        •iind his first counting-house was in Litherland Alley, behind Pool
     Lane. He acted as selling broker for the Messrs. Eathbone and
      •other leading importers of those days, and his firm soon took
      the influential position Avhich it has since retained. He also acted
      as buying broker for some of the leading consumers in the
     manufacturing districts. It was probably through Mr. Waterhouse
     that Messrs. William Eathbone and Son, in 1784, sold to Messrs.
      Strutt and Co., of Belper, the eight bags of American cotton which
     were temporarily detained at the Custom House, on the ground
      that they were not American growth. Soon after the alterations
     connected with the widening of Castle Street, Water Street, and
      the isolating of the Exchange (now Town Hall), which commenced
      in 1786, Mr. Waterhouse removed to the new Exchange Alley,
      -erected on the west side of the Town Hall. SomeAvhere about
      1795, Mr. Isaac Cooke, who came from Manchester, entered into
     the family and counting-house of Mr. Waterhouse, and eventually,
     about 1803, became his partner. In the meantime, Mr, Waterhouse
     had for several years been in ^partnership with Mr. James Sill,
    who at one time resided with the Waterhouses in Pool Lane.
     This partnership was in existence for only a few years, and was
     terminated in 1804. The style of the firm was Waterhouse and
        Sill, and the counting-house was in Druid's Court, Dale Street.
     They were general brokers, and the firm was quite distinct from
      that of Nicholas Waterhouse, cotton broker, whose ofiice was
        still in Exchange Alley. Mr. Cooke retired from the firm in
      1819, and Mr. AVaterhouse's three sons, Nicholas, Daniel, and
      Alfred, were admitted. In 182.3 the ofiice was removed to
      Oldhall Street, Avhere it still remains. Mr. Nicholas Waterhouse,
      jun., died in 1830; shortly after Avhich Mr. Thomas Bouch,

     who had been with[ the][ firm] since 1825, prior [to] which he had
       served an [apprenticeship] of seven years, 1818-25, with Messrs.
       Salishury, Turner, and Earle, was taken into partnership. In
      1833 or 1834 Mr. [Waterhoiise's][ fourth][ son,][ Mr.][ Rogers][ Waterhouse,]
      was admitted [a][ partner.] His third son, Alfred, retired in 1844
       or 1845. In 1845 Mr. Henry Cox, [and][ in][ 1846][ Mr.][ James][ Cox,]
      were taken into partnership. This partnership terminated in
       1854, and [the][ Messrs.][ Cox][ estahlished a][ separate][ firm][ under][ the]
        style of Cox [Brothers.] Mr. Rogers Waterhouse was President
        of the Cotton [Brokers'][ Association][ in][ 1859] ; a few years later he
        retired from business. In the meantime Mr. Daniel Waterhouse
        died. In January, 1865, the firm consisted of Mr. Thomas
      Bouch; his son, Mr. John Bouch, admitted in 1854; Mr. John
      D. Waterhouse [(son][ of] [Mr.][ Rogers][ Waterhouse),][ and][ Mr.][ William]
      Waterhouse (son of Mr. Alfred). A few years later Mr. WilHam
      Waterhouse died, and Mr. Thomas Wilkinson Bouch, [second][ son]
        of Mr. Thomas Bouch, was[ admitted.] Mr. John D. Waterhouse
        retired in 1876. Mr. Bouch, sen., retired in 1876. Mr. John
      Bouch died in 1882. There now remained only Mr. T. AVilkinson
       Bouch, Avho took [into][ partnership][ Mr.][ Robert][ Morris,] Mr. W. E.
       Stanley Clarke, and Mr. T. E. L. Maw, since which there have-
       been no further changes. During the more than one hundred
       years which the firm has been in existence it has throughout
       occupied a foremost position [in][ the] [commercial][ ranks][ of][ the][ town,]
       and has always been [held][ in][ the][ highest][ esteem][ on][ 'Change.] The
      memory of Mr. Rogers W^aterhouse is especially fresh and green
        in the hearts [of][ those] who[ knew][ him.]
       When Mr. Isaac Cooke withdrew from the firm of [Nicholas]
      Waterhouse and Co. he invited Mr. William Comer [to join] him
        in partnership. Mr. Comer was the only remaining member of
       the firm of Holt, Davies, and Comer, founded somewhere about
       1775 by Mr. Joshua Holt, who was joined by Mr. Thomas
       Davies in 1 790, and by Mr. Comer (when only nineteen years of
        age) in 1802. In Smithers' History of Liverpool, irablished in
        1823, it is stated that the house of Holt, Davies, and Comer
      was the [origin][ of][ that][ of][ Cooke][ and] Comer. But this was not

      correct. Mr. Comer wound up the business, and closed the office,
      of Holt, Davies, and Comer, at 3, Exchange Street West, and
      joined Mr. Cooke in an entirely new firm, at new premises, 1,
     Exchange Buildings, under the st3de of Isaac Cooke and William
      •Comer. The Rathbones of those days had for some time done
     the whole of their cotton business with the house of Waterhouse.
     In 1812 or 1813 they gave a portion to Mr. Henry Whitaker,
     who, after having served an apprenticeship with Mr. Waterhouse,
     •commenced business on his own account. They now drew
     the remaining portion away and gave it to the new firm of Cooke
     and Comer, Mr. Cooke having been a great favourite with Mr.
     William Rathbone and his partners ; and ever since then the
      -connection between the two firms has been unbroken. As both
     Mr. Cooke and Mr. Comer were men of energy, the firm soon
     took a leading position in the market. They did business for
      the principal merchants of the day. Mr. Vincent Nolte, in his
     "Fifty Years in Both Hemispheres," relates that during a visit
     to Liverpool in 1823, he was made acquainted with a manifesto
     which was about to be issued by the Messrs. Cropper (Cropper,
     Benson, and Co.), showing that the consumption of cotton was
     overtaking production, and that as a consequence very high
      prices would shortly be witnessed. He was invited by Mr. David
     Hodgson, then a partner in the firm of Rathbone, Hodgson, and
     Co. (subsequently Rathbone Brothers and Co.), to attend a
     conference to be held at the counting-house of Messrs. Cropper,
     Benson, and Co.,(^) then in Paradise Street :
      When we reached the place, the elder Mr. James Cropper, head of the
       firm, was m his sanctum sanctorum, a homely sort of chamber, which
      touched the great hall of the general counting-room, and possessed a double
      iron door. In this chamber we were mysteriously introduced hj Mr.
     David Hodgson, and after our entrance, the head of the greatest cotton-
      broking firm, Mr. Cooke, of the firm of Cooke and Comer, was sent for ;
      meanwhile the already mentioned, ever ready manifesto, was exhibited.
            (^) Mr. Robei't Mason served an apprenticeship with the house of
      Cropper, Benson, and Co. In 1834 he commenced business on his own
      account. In 1836 he was joined by Mr. John Willis (Mason and Willis).
      This partnership was dissolved in 1838. Mr. Willis remained alone until
       his death in 1877. Mr. Mason was alone until 1853, when he took into
      partnership Mr. James Lister (Mason and Lister). Mr. -J. E. Dudley Ryder

        With the exception of a short period, 1820-1821, during^
      which Mr. Isaac Hodgson (^) (brother of Mr. Adam Hodgson) was a
        partner, and the style was Cooke, Comer, and Hodgson, there
      was no change nntil_ ] 828, in which year there was a dissohition
        of partnership. Mr. Cooke was subsequently joined by Mr.
      Henry Eobson, who had previously been in partnership with Mr.
      Eason (Eason and Eobson), and the firm became Isaac Cooke
      and Co. In 183.3 Mr. Cooke's two sons, Mr. George Cooke and
      Mr. Isaac B. Cooke, were taken into partnership, and the style
      was altered to Isaac Cooke and Sons, and has since remained-
      unchanged. Mr. Cooke, senior, retired in 1840, Mr. Eobson in
        1858,(-) and Mr. George Cooke in 1870. The present partners
       are Mr. Isaac B. Cooke, his son, Mr. Bancroft Cooke, admitted
       in 1870, and his cousin, Mr. Wm. H. Cooke, admitted in 1864.
      Mr. Cooke, the founder of the firm, was one of the founders and
        original Directors of the Bank of Liverpool. Mr. Isaac B. Cooke
      was President of the Cotton Brokers' Association in 1855,(") and
       was admitted January 1, 1872. Mr. Lister retired December 31, 1872. Mr.
     Wm. Naylor, nephew of Mr. Mason, was admitted January ], 1873. He
         retired January 1, 1875, and Mr. Charles Edward Mason (son oJt the Senior)
       was admitted. Mr. Mason, Senior, retired in 1876, wlien the style of the
        firm was altered to Mason and Eyder. Mr. Mason, Junior, retired in 1882.
       Mr. Tliomas Fairclough served his apprenticeship with Mr. Robert Mason.
        In 1864 he joined Mr. Albert Fenton, of Roclidale, who in that year
       commenced as a cotton broker. On the retirement of Mr. Fenton to
        Manchester, Mr. Fairclough contmued the business in his o-svn name. He
        took his brotlier (Mr. James E. Fairclougli) into partnerslaip in 1873, and
        the stj'le of the firm became Thomas Fau'clough & Co.
              (*) In 1821 Mr. Isaac Hodgson (on retiring from the firm of Cooke,
       Comer and Hodgson) became a partner in the firm of Sands, Hodgson and
         Co., merchants. Some twelve or fifteen years later lie witlidrew from this
        firm (whicli became Sands, Turner and Co.), and joined the Leicester
       Banking firm of Pares and Heygate, which became Pares, Heygate and
       Hodgson, now Pares' Leicestershire Banking Company.
              (-) Mr. Robson witlidrew from the firm of Isaac Cooke and Sons in
        order to commence business with his son-in-law, Mr. Robert Atkinson
        Eskrigge, u.nder the style of Robson and Eskrigge. This was in 1858.
       Mr. Robson retired in 1867. Mr. Frank Pooley was admitted in 1871, and
       Mr. Henry J. Legge in 1876. The style of the firm since 1876 has been
        Eskrigge, Pooley and Co. Mr. Eskrigge is a J. P. for the Hundred of Wirral.
                   (•') The late Mr. Edward Franceys was brought up in the house of
        Isaac Cooke and Sons. In 1834 he entered into partnership with Mr.
       Thomas Haigh (son of an extensive Manchester merchant), under the style
         of Haigh and Franceys. A little later they were joined by Mr. William
       Comer (who had been in partnership with Mi". Isaac Cooke), but in 1839'

       in that capacity was appointed to report upon the raw cotton
      exhibited at the Paris Exposition in the same year.
        Mr. Henry Whitaker, mentioned above as one of the Water-
      house's apprentices, commenced business on his own account in
      1812 or 1813, with an office in Exchange Alley. In 1816 he was
      joined by Mr. Matthew Miller (Miller and Whitaker), and the
        office was removed to Eumford Street. In 1822 or 182-3 Mr.
     Theodore Eathbone became a partner (Miller, Whitaker and
      Rathbone). In 1833 Mr. Miller retired, and the firm became
      Whitaker, Rathbone and Co. In 1838, on the retirement of Mr.
     Rathbone, it was changed to Whitaker, Carter and Co., Mr.
     Robert Redder Carter being a jjartner. In 1850 it became
      Whitaker, Whitehead and Co., on the admission of Mr. Walter
     Horrocks Whitehead, a retired captain of the old East India
     Company's service, and has since remained without change. Mr.
     John Penson Whitaker, son of the founder, was a partner for
    many years, and retired a feAV years since. Mr. E. H. Harrison
     was admitted in 1852; Mr. E. Habershon (one of Gladstone and
      Serjeantson's apprentices) in 1862; and Mr. John Whitehead
      (son of Mr. W. H. Whitehead) and_Mr. Charles W. Smith (brought
       afterwards there was a dissolution of partnershiij ; and henceforth there
      were two firms: T. Haigh and Co., consisting of Mr. Haigh and Mr. Charles
      Arthur Miller ; and Fi-anceys and Comer, consisting of Mr. E. Franceys
      andMr. George Comer, son of William. At the close of 1846 Mr. Miller
       retired from the firm of T. Haigh and Co., and Mr. Haigh 's eldest son,
      Edwin, became a partner. Later on came Mr. Reginald Haigh. Mr.
      Alexander (afterwards Sir Alexander) E^amsay was admitted as partner in
      November, 1863. He retired a few years ago, prior to which Mr. Edwin
      Haigh had also retired. The only remaining partners are Mr. Reginald
      Haigh and Mr. Henry J. C. Anderson, who, after having been with the
       firm some two or three years, was in 1881 taken into partnership. He had
       served an apprenticeship with Mr. Lewis Lloyd. The late Mr. Haigh was
       President of the Cotton Brokers' Association in 1857. [Mr. G. C. H.
      Dunlop (G. C. H. Dunlop and Co. ) served with Messrs. Haigh and Co. , and
      commenced business in 1873. He was subsequently joined by his brother,
      Mr. R. G. Dunlop.] The style of the firm of Franceys and Comer was
       not altered until 1864, when it was changed to Comer and Harrison.
      Meanwhile Mr, Franceys had retired in .January, 1850, and Mr. James B.
       Harrison had been admitted in July, 1850. Mr. Arthur Franceys, son of
      one of the founders of the firm, was admitted in 1875, and Mr. Arthur
       Harrison, son of the second member of the firm, was admitted in 1882.
      Amongst the old apprentices brought up in the house of Isaac Cooke and
       Sons are Mr. Arthur W. Biggs (Czarnicow and Cox), Mr. Henry Pearce,
       son of the founder of the firm of Henry Pearce and Co., and Mr. Richard

      Mr. Habershon in 1883, in which year also Mr. Harrison with-
      drew and estabHshed the firm of E. H. Harrison and Co. : Mr. Smith
       continuing to carry on business under the old style of Whitaker,
      Whitehead and Co. Mr. John Given and Mr. Edward S. Braddyll
      were both brought ujo in the house of Whitaker, Whitehead and
       Co. They commenced business in July, 1860, under the style
        of Given and Braddyll. Mr. Given was President of the
       Association in 1881. . Mr. Braddyll was the author of an amusing
        brochure^ entitled the " Lays of Cotton Broking," in which are hit
        off the men and manners of the market during the American war. (^)
        One of Mr. Waterhouse's most eminent apprentices was
      Mr. Samuel Hope (son of Mr. William Hope, merchant), who
     commenced business on his own account in 1805 at No. 3, Water
       Street, and of whose valuable services as the pioneer statistician
       of the cotton market an account has been given in a previous
       chapter. Mr, Hope's most eminent apprentice was Mr. George
       Holt, son of Mr. Oliver Holt, woollen manufacturer, Rochdale.
      While in Liverpool in 1807, on a visit at Mr. Henry Holmes,
      head of the firm of Henry Holmes and Sons, merchants, Mr.
       Holt, sen., was informed that Mr. Samuel Hoj^e, cotton broker,
      was in want of an a2Dprentice. It occurred to him that the
       situation avouIcI suit his son George ; and he at once opened
       negotiations with Mr. Hope. The result was that George, then
      about seventeen years of age, left Rochdale on the 5th October
       for Manchester, where he stayed for the night, and was on the
       following day driven to Liverpool in a gig by his brother-indaw.
             C-) [Mr.][ Braddyll][ died][ in][ 1881.] Mr. Given retired in September this
       year (1885). The firm now consists of Mr. A. Sankey, admitted in 1882 ;
       Mr. H. E R, a. Braddyll, admitted in 1S82, and Mr. H. H. Noltenius,
       admitted in 1883. One of Whitaker, AVhitehead and Co.'s best known
       apprentices was the late Mr. William H. Smethnrst. He was for some
       years head of the cotton department in the firm of Browne, Hunter and Co.
       In 1870 he commenced business in partnership with Mr. George Hartley,
       under the style of Smethnrst and Hartley. This partnersliip was dissolved
        in 1872, and each partner for a time continued the business on his own
        account. Another of Whitaker, Whitehead and Co.'s apprentices was Mr.
       William Barcroft, who, along with Mr. I. S. Bulloch, commenced business
        in 1870, under the style of Bulloch and Barcroft. This partnership was
        dissolved in 1875, and the business has since been carried on by Mr.
          I. S. Bulloch, under the style of I S Bulloch and Co

     They arrived at the Angel Inn late in the evening of the 6th,
     and on the morning of [the][ 7th][ October,] 1807, [he][ commenced][ his]
      apprenticeship of five years. It was not at first a fixed intention
      that he should remain in [Liverpool] ; but he made such satisfactory
      progress that at the close of his five years service Mr. Hope
       offered him a partnership in the firm, which of course was
      accepted. The circular issued by Mr. Hope announcing the
      change in the firm is worth quoting. It is dated November 28th,
     1812:—
           I have the pleasure to [apprise][ you][ that][ I][ have][ taken][ Mr.][ George][ Holt]
      mto partnei'ship with myself, [under][ the][ firm][ of][ "Samuel][ Hope][ and][ Co."]
      Having been invited to this measure by [the][ assistance][ I][ have][ derived][ from]
      Mr. Holt's ability and application [during] five years in which he has been
       acquiring a knowledge of the business [in] my office, I am encouraged to
      hope that these qualities will [powerfully][ second] my [own][ exertions][ to][ merit]
       a continuance of your patronage.
     Then follow the two signatures, Avhich are so remarkably alike
      that they might both have been written by the same hand.
      Another feature is that the style of handwriting[ is] exceptionally
      good. Mr. Samuel Hope's high appreciation of the good [qualities]
       of his apprentice were more than justified by the subsequent
       career of his eminent protegS. Mr. Holt became not only a
       successful cotton broker, but also a prominent citizen and an
      eminent philanthropist. He was a member of the Town[ Council]
      from 1835 to 18-56. He was a J.P. for the Borough and [County.]
     He did invaluable service in connection with the Dock Estate,
      which he always maintained should be managed solely for [the]
      national good, and not for the [benefit][ of][ local][ or][ private][ interests.]
      His work as Chairman of the Water Committee was also of
     immense value to the town, as were also his services on the
      Library and Museum Committee. In addition to these public
       duties he gave liberally of his time and money to [the] [promotion]
       of political freedom; toAvards the support of the various public
       •charities of the town; but especially towards [the furtherance] of
      popular education. Through a long course of years he gave
      unwearied attention to the development of the Liverpool Mechanics
       Institution, now the Liverpool Institute, and particularly to that
      branch of it known as the Girls' School, Blackburn House, the

        first school of the kind established in this country. Blackburn-
     House was subsequently given to thg Directors of the Institute to
      perpetuate the memory of Mr. Holt.
       The firm of Samuel Hope and Co. carried on business as
      bankers as well as cotton brokers. In 1821 the partnership was
       dissolved, Mr. Hope taking the banking department, and Mr.
      Holt the cotton department. The banking business was continued
      under the style of Samuel Hope and Co., and the cotton business
      under the style of George Holt and Co., Mr. Holt taking into
      partnership Mr. John CoA^ard, who had been brouglit up in
      the old firm. In 1831 Mr. Holt, Mr. Isaac Cooke, Mr. Adam
      Hodgson, and others, established the first joint stock bank in
      Liverpool, " The Bank of Liverpool." Some years later Mr.
     Samuel Hope, owing to failing health, disposed of his business to
       a joint stock company, under the style of the Liverpool Borough
      Bank. Mr. Holt was mainly instrumental in establishing the
      Liverpool Fire and Life Insurance Company (now the Liverpool
      and London and Globe), through the instrumentality of Avhich
      the premiums charged for Liverpool risks were considerably
      reduced.
       The style of the firm of George Holt and Co. has never
      been altered, though there have been several partnership) changes.
      Mr. Coward retired on Jamiary 1st, 1847, and Mr. William
     Durning (cousin to Mrs. Holt) and Mr. W. Burning Holt were
      admitted. Mr. Holt died in 1861. Mr. Durning died in 1881,
     and his death, like that of Mr. Holt himself, was felt to be a
      great and more than usually distinct loss to the Cotton Brokers'
       Association. Mr. W. D. Holt retired several years ago. He is a
        J. P. for the County. His brother, Mr. E. Durning Holt, who
     became a partner in 1854, and Mr. Middleton Beckett, brought up
       in the house, and taken into partnership in 1881, noAV constitute
       the firm. The market reports issued by Mr. Samuel Hope
       Avere amongst the best circulars published. The annual tables
       of supply and consumption were quite unique ; [and][ for][ something]
       like half-a-century they Avere the only figures on the movements

       Britannica, Macculloch's Commercial Didlonary, and other works-
       of reference. They are also cited by Mr. Baines, Dr. Ure, and
       other Avriters on cotton of a cjuarter to half a century ago.
      Moreover, they formed the basis of the annual tables issued by
       the Cotton Brokers' Association. When the new firm of George
      Holt and Co. was started, the compilation of the annual statistics
      was taken in hand by Mr. Coward, and on his retirement the work
      was continued by Mr. Durning, until the tables were merged in
       the annual circular of the Brokers' Association. Mr. Holt was the
         first President of the Association (1842), Mr. Durning the twenty-
      second (1863), and Mr. Robert D. Holt the thirty-sixth (1877). The
      last-named is a J. P., and also D.L., for the County of Lancaster.
     He is also a member of the City Council. When Mr. Samuel Hope
        left Mr. Waterhouse to commence business on his own account, the
       Messrs. Strutt, the eminent cotton spinners, of Derbyshire, went
      with him ; [and][ the][ connection,][ first] with Mr. [Hope][ and][ then][ with]
       Messrs. Holt, has remained unbroken for a period of eighty years.
         Messrs. George Holt and Co., besides supjilying the Cotton
      Brokers' Association with its first President, also educated its
        first and only Secretary, Mr. Studley Martin, an apprentice of
    whom the firm may be very proud. Mr. Martin, after being
       for a short time with Messrs. Baring Brothers and Co. entered (in
      1835) into partnership with Mr. Hew Stevenson, cotton broker,
       successor of Mr. William Stevenson, who commenced business
      about 1820. The style of the firm was Stevenson and Martin.
     The partnership was dissolved in 1840, and Mr. Martin continued
       in business on his own account. He acted as honorary secretary
       to the brokers several years before the formal establishment of the
      Association in 1841, and has consequently filled the office for
      nearly half a century, during which period the consumption of
      cotton in Great Britain has risen from 20,000 bales (of 4001bs)
      per week to 72,000 bales. Mr. Martin's career is altogether
      unique in the annals of trade, and he has now become quite an
       institution in the market. His appointment as Secretary has
      been renewed with, if possible, increasing acclamation at every
      succeeding annual meeting of the Association, and one of the late

     Presidents, in proposing his re-election, observed, that ["] Presidents
     come and Presidents go, but the Secretary remains [for][ ever."] In
     December, 1882, Mr. Martin was voted a very handsome testi-
     monial on the attainment of his seventieth birthday ; [and][ the]
     wish was heartily and unanimously expressed that he might long
       Tbe spared to the Association. Mr. Martin's immediate junior at
     •George Holt and Co. was Mr. Henry Cronipton Booth, son [of] Mr.
    Henry Booth, treasurer to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
    On completing his aj^prenticeship, in 1837, he entered into
     partnership with Mr. Francis Hollins (who hailed from Notting-
    ham) under the style of Booth and Hollins. This partnership
      •ceased in 1840, and late in 1841 the style of the firm was [Hollins]
     and Turner. Mr. Turner was connected with the manufacturing
       districts. He retired in 1843. In 1847 Mr. Hollins was joined
    by Mr. John Pownall (Hollins and Pownall). This partnership
     was dissolved in 1852, and Mr. Hollins remained alone until
     January 1st, 1864, on Avhich day he took into partnership his son,
     Mr. Herbert Hollins, and Mr. Robert Thomson Gladstone [(Francis]
     Hollins and Co.) Mr. C. H. Hollins was admitted in 1867. Mr.
     Gladstone died in 1871 and Mr. Herbert Hollins in 1876. Mr.
     Joseph H. Robinson, previously a partner in the firm of Hornby
     and Robinson, was admitted in 1876, and Mr. E. F. Hollins in
      1878.(^) The firm of Hornby and Robinson had been in existence
      since 1862. On the retirement of Mr. Robinson, Mr. H. H.
    Hornby Avas joined by Mr. Paul E. J. Hemelryk (Hornby,
     Hemelryk and Co.) Mr. Hornby is a Justice of the Peace for
     the City, and was President of the Cotton Brokers' Association
     in 1876. When Mr. Pownall withdrew from the firm of Hollins
     and Pownall (in 1852) he joined one of George Holt and Co.'s
      favourite apprentices, Mr. Francis Thornely, who had been in
      business on his own account since 1847. The style of the firm
     was Thornely and Pownall.(^) Mr. Pownall retired in 1883,
    when his son, Mr. John Arthur Pownall was admitted.
            (^) Mr. H. H. Hanmer served his apprenticesliiiJ with [Francis][ Hollins]
      and Co., and commenced business in 1873 (Hanmer and Co.) Mr. Tyson

      1816 to 1821—Duckworth and [Watkins][ 1822][ to][ 1827,] [and][ Duck-]
     worth and Marsden in 1831. Mr. Duckworth's son, Mr. Nicholas
     Duckworth, Avas admitted a partner a [feAv][ years][ before][ the][ forma-]
      tion of the Cotton Brokers' [Association][ in] 1841, [and][ the][ style][ was.]
      altered to Duckworths and Marsden. Mr. Hugh Duckworth retired
      in 1 844. Subsequently the firm became Duckworth and Rathbone
       (the partners being Mr. Nicholas [Duckworth,][ Mr.][ Benson][ Rathbone,]
     and Mr. Walter Duckworth). After a continuance of many years
       this partnership was dissolved, and two [firms][ existed]—[namely,] N.
     Duckworth and Sons (Walter and Charles), and [Rathbone,][ Clay,(^)]
     and Co.— but on the retirement of Mr. [Duckworth][ the][ firms][ were]
      again united under the style of Rathbone, DuckAvorth [and][ Co.] The
      partnership now consists of Mr. Benson Rathbone, Mr. T. Campbell
      Clay, Mr. Walter Duckworth [(son][ of] Mr.[ Nicholas][ Duckworth),][ Mr.]
     Jerome Smith, Mr. Arthur B. Rathbone [(son][ of][ the][ senior][ partner),,]
     and Mr. Alexander Muir. Mr. Benson Rathbone Avas President of
      the Association in 1871.(-)
       house of Messrs. T. W. and J. C. Harrop and Co. He commenced
       business in 1873, and was joined by Mr. James in 1878. The firm of
       T. W. and J. C. Harrop and Co. was originally Harrop, Button and Co.,
      and was founded in 1847.
                        ( ^ ) Mr. Thomas Campbell Clay was brought up in the house of Anthony
      Swainson and Sons. This firm was founded by Mr. Anthony Swainson, at
       the opening of the present century. In 1821 the style was Swainson and
      Inman, merchants, and remained so until about 1829. In 1830 Mr.
      Swainson was by himself, and he was alone until [the][ admission][ of][ his][ two-]
        sons, John and George, in 1857, when[ the][ style][ became][ Anthony][ Swainson]
      and Sons. Mr. T. B. Black burne was connected with the [firm,] though
       not actually a partner. He was President in 1856, and Mr. John Swainson
       occupied that position in 1862. The only remaining partner is Mr. George-
       Swainson. Mr. S. Smith, [of] the [firm][ of] S. and E. Smith, founded in 1869,
      was brought up in the house [of] [Swainson][ and][ Sons.]
             (-) Mr. W. H. Richards ser\^ed his apprenticeship with Duckworth
      and Rathbone, and, along with Mr. John Owen, commenced [business][ in]
        1867, as Richards, Owen [and][ Co.] This partnership has since been dissolved,
      and the firm is now W. H. [Richards][ and][ Co.] Mr. B. L. Tarleton was also
      brought up in the house of Duckworth and [Rathbone.] He was for a short
       time in partnership with Mr. Pim Cheriy, under the style[ of] Tarleton [and]
       Cherry, with which firm Mr. W. H. L. Openshaw served his apprentice-

       Another of Mr. Waterhouse's[ apprentices][ who][ attained][ great]
     eminence in the market was Mr. Eobert Gill, who somewhere
     about 1810 joined the [firm][ of] [Eichard][ Dohson][ and][ Co.,][ who][ had]
     commenced business in or about 1795, and [Avhose] office was in
     Cotton Court, ElboAV Lane [(now][ Sweeting] Street). It stood on
      the present site of the Queen Insurance [Buildings.] In front of
      the court, facing Dale Street, was the old coaching-house, the
     Golden Lion Inn. Mr. Gill Avas one of the first to adopt an
      innoA^ation in the method[ of] offering cotton, AA^hich at the outset
       Avas strongly opposed by [the][ majority][ of][ the][ brokers.] Down to
      the opening of the present century the usual practice Avas for
      the seller to [give][ to][ the][ buyer][ the][ marks,][ ship's][ name,][ and][ place]
      of storage of any [lot][ or] lots of cotton Avhich he might haA^e [for]
       sale, in order that the buyer might go to the Avarehouse and
     examine the bales for [himself][ ;] and it Avas an understanding [that]
      the cotton should [not] be[ offered][ to][ a][ second][ buyer][ until][ the][ first]
     had given in his [refusal.] As the warehouses in those days were
        all Avithin five to ten [minutes'] Avalk from the Exchange, and in
    many instances over [the][ countingdiouses] of the OAvners of the
      cotton, in, or close to, the Exchange itself, there AA^'as no time
       of moment lost by this custom. MoreoA^er, the practice was
     rendered absolutely [necessary][ in] [consequence][ of][ the][ irregular][ waj]
      in which many of [the][ bales][ were][ packed.] But Avith the large in-
      crease in the production[ of][ cotton][ in][ the][ United][ States][ (rendered]
      possible by the [invention][ of][ the][ saw-gin][ in] 1793), and[ the][ con-]
      sequent considerable arrivals here of better and more regularly
     packed bales (or bags, as they Avere then), the necessity for
     examining each package at the Avarehouse before making a bid
     became less and less [requisite.] Hence arose the custom, Avith the
      origin of Avhich Mr. Gill's name is associated, of offering cotton
     by sample on [a][ counter.] This practice, as already stated, Avas at
        first strongly opposed [by] [many] of the brokers, on the ground
      that if the dealers [and][ spinners][ could][ purchase][ cotton][ by][ merely]
     examining samples on a [counter,][ they][ could][ see][ the][ samples][ at]
      the office of the [importer] himself, and thus altogether dispense
       Avith the assistance [of][ the][ broker.] As a matter of fact, nothing

        •of the sort happened, and the obvious convenience of tlie new
      •system soon brought it into general practice, though the old
      practice was not entirely abandoned until many years after the
    new one had been commenced. In the course of the ninety years
      during which the firm of Gill, late Dobson, has been in existence
       tlrere have been several changes in the style. In 179.5 Richard
     Dobson and Co.; in 180.5 Richard Dobson and Son;. in 1807
     Richard Dobson and Sons; in 1813 Richard Dobson and Co. (Mr.
     Robert Gill a partner); 1826 Dobson and Gill; 1838 Gill and
      Syers, on the admission of Mr. John Aspinall Syers; 1843 Gill,
     8yers and Co., on the admission of Mr. William Titherington
      1846 Gill, Titherington and Gill, on the retirement of Mr. Syers,
     and the admission of Mr. Robert Gill (nephew of the head of the
       firm), who had been thirteen years Avith Messrs. Hollinshead,
      Tetle}^ and Co.; 1859, Titherington, Gill and Co., on the retire-
     ment of Mr. Robert Gill,senior, whose son, Mr. Chappie Gill, had
     been admitted in 1854; and 1867, R. and C. Gill, on the retire-
     ment of Mr. Titherington, who for a short time conducted a
      business on his OAvn account, under the style of William
      Titherington and Co. Mr. Robert Gill, the elder, Avas President
      of the Association in 1847.(^)
            (^) Mr. Thomas Postlethwaite served his apprenticeship with Gill and
       Syers, and commenced biisiness on his own account in 1842. In 1855 Mr.
      Robert Norris -Jones (brought up in Waterhouse's) and Mr. James Robert
      Williams (for some years with the firm) were taken into partnership. Mr.
     W. H. Williams and Mr. Edmund Buckley were brought up in this firm,
        <and commenced business on their own account (Williams and Buckley) in
        1864. On the retirement of Mr. Williams, Mr. Buckley took into partner-
       ship his brother, Mr. Henry A. Buckley (E. and H. Buckley), and these
      two now constitute the firm. Mr. William Fox Avas a fellow apprentice
      with Mr. Postlethwaite, in the office of Gill and Syers. Mr. Fox had a some-
      what A^aried biisiness experience. He was at one time with a tea merchant
      then with a stock and share broker ; then with a leading firm of accountants
       afterwards in business on his own account, as a stock and share broker, then
       as an accountant. Later on he Avas for several years master of the Lyceum
        iSTeAvsroom. He was also for a time with Mr. Postlethwaite, and CA^en-
       tually commenced business as a cotton broker, during which part of his
       career he had as an apprentice Mr. S. C. M. Pilkington, Avho, with Mr.
      William Burrill, commenced business in 1866, under the style of Pilkington,
       Burrill and Co., which, on the retirement of Mr. Burrill in 1871, was
       altered S. C. M. Pilkington and Co. Mr. H. P. Forwood v/as brought up
       in the house of Gill, Titherington and Gill, and was from 1862 until 1866
       in partnership Avith the late Mr. E. Meugens, and afterwards with the late
      Mr. Zigomala. Mr. Charles Williams was one of R. and C. Gill's appren-
        tices, and commenced business on his own account in 1874, and was later
      on joined by his brother, Mr. George Williams (Charles Williams and Co.)

       One of the first clients of Eichard Dobson and Co. was Mr-
      William Heaton, cotton merchant, of Blackburn. The connection
      continued until somewhere about 1808, when Mr. Heaton, detect-
      ing a growing desire on the part of his spinning friends in
      Blackburn to purchase their cotton through brokers in Liverpool,
      instead of from merchants or dealers in their own town, gave up
       his warehouse in Blackburn, and commenced business here, in
      Tarleton Buildings, Chapel Street, as a buying broker. (^) He-
      died in 1835 or 1836, and was succeeded by Mr. Edward Eccles,
     who carried on the business in his own name until 1872, when
      the style was altered to Edward Eccles and Co., on the admission
       of Mr. Eobert Langley Wilson, son of Mr. J. Wilson, the well-
     known shipbuilder. Mr. Edward Eccles died in June, 1873, aged
      66 years, and the firm [has] since been conducted by Mr. Wilson.
     Mr. Joseph Eccles was brought up in the office of his cousin
     Edward, and commenced business on his own account in 1841.
    He was subsequently [joined] by [his][ brother] Edward, and later on
     by their nephew, Mr. [Alexander][ Eccles][ (who][ came] from London
      University, after taking his degree of B.A., and was a son of Mr.
     Thomas Eccles, of Darwen). The style of the firm remained
     Joseph Eccles and Co. until [the][ retirement][ of] Mr. Joseph Eccles,
      in 1857, when [it] was [altered][ to][ A.] and[ E.][ Eccles,] and[ later] on to
     Alexander Eccles and Co. The late Mr. Robert Cummins, (who,
      along with Mr. Hulley, exposed [the deceptions] of [the] Davenport
      Brothers,) was brought up in the firm, and was for several year&
      a partner. He was a splendid athlete, a good musician, as well
       as a good cotton broker, and was[ exceedingly][ popular][ amongst]
     an exceptionally Avide circle of friends. The firm of Alexander
      Eccles and Co. noAV consists of Mr. [Eccles,][ his][ brother,] Mr.[ Eccles]
            (1) About the time that Mr. Eccles [came][ from][ Blackburn][ to][ succeed]
      Mr. Heaton, the firm of Livesey and Thorpe was started, to represent
       other Blackburn spinners. The style was altered to Livesey, Sons, and Co.
       in 1869. They were succeeded by their apprentices, the [present] firm of
       Kelly, Bacheldor, and Co. Mr. R. Priestley served his apprenticeship with
       Livesey, Sons, and Co., and is now a partner with his lorother, Mr. S. E.
       Priestley, in the firm of Priestley and Nott, founded[ in] 1872. Mr. S. E.
       Priestley was brought up in the office of Mr. P. [Mussabmi,] who commenced
       business as a cotton broker in 1860. Mr. J. B. Clarke also served his
       apprenticeship with Mr. Mussabmi, and commenced business [in] 1873 as
        J. B. Clarke and Co.

       Coming down to a later period, we have another of Messrs.
     Waterhouse's eminent apprentices, Mr. Richard Stead, who along
      Avith his brother, Mr. Fishwick Stead, brought up in the firm of
     Jee Brothers, commenced business in 1845. Mr. Fishwick Stead is
     the Sir John Lubbock of [the] Association. It is mainly to his efforts,
      in years gone [b}',] [that][ the] members of the Association are indebted
     for the periodical [holidays] which they noAv enjoy. A few years ago
       all holidays (other than those fixed by Act of Parliament) were
      either actively or passively opposed by many members of the
     Association, either as likel}- to interfere with business, or as
     unlikely to be strictly observed ; but, thanks to Mr. Stead's
     persevering and eloquent advocacy, the opposition was continually
     beaten, and finally [driven][ off][ the][ field.][ (^)]
       Another eminent and popular member of the Association
     Mr. H. H. Nicholson—[also][ served] his apprenticeship in the house
     of Waterhouse. In 1850 he became a partner in the firm of James
    Logan and Co.(-) This partnership was dissolved in 1856, Mr.
     Nicholson commencing business on his own account. In 1862 he
    was joined by Mr. Arthur Wrigley (previously in partnership
     with Mr. Samuel Withers, under the style of Withers and
     Wrigley), grandson of Mr. John Wrigley, founder of the firm of
    John Wrigley and Sons ; and the style of the firm was altered to
     Nicholson and Wrigley, which it still remains. Mr. Nicholson's
           (1) Mr. Eichard Hooton was bi'oiiglit up in the firm of Stead Brothers.
    He was for a short time (in 1864 onwai-ds) in partnership with Mr. James
      "Wilkinson, one of Titherington, (4ill, and Co. 's apprentices. Mr. Robert
      vStead Thorp was also brought up in the house of Stead Brothers. He,
      along with Mr. Sager, commenced business in 1874 (Thorp, Sager and Co.)
       Ml-. Frederick Crowther Higgins was subsequently admitted a partner.
     Later on Mr. Sager retii-ed.
           (-) The firm of James Logan and Co. referred to above, M^as founded
     by the late Mr. James Logan, [with] whom Mr. Nicholson was for a time in
      partnership. Mr. Logan was succeeded by his son, Mr. James Logan, jiin.,
     who, ill 1860, took into partnership Mr. Jonathan Shaw, jun. (brought up
      in the house of J. and M. Joynson), the style of the firm being Logan and
     Shaw. This partnership was dissolved in 1865. Li 1871 the style was
      altered to Logan, Fletcher, and Co., on the admission as partner of Mr.
      Geoi'ge Fletcher. Mr. Logan died in 1883, and the firm now consists of
     Mr. Fletcher, Mr. E de Kuyper, admitted in 1876, and Mr. William
     Marcus, admitted in 1881.

      second son (Mr. Charles M. [Nicholson)] was admitted as partner
       in 1879. His third son (Mr. H. Nicholson) became a partner in
       1881. Mr. Nicholson was[ President] of the Association in 1869.
     He is a City [Alderman][ for][ Rodney][ Street][ Ward.]
       When Mr. Nicholson [withdrew][ from][ the][ firm][ of][ James][ Lo.2;an]
      and Co. he left there one who Avas destined to become not only
      an exceptionally successful cotton broker, but one of the most
      popular citizens of Liverpool, [as][ well][ as][ one][ of][ the][ most] eminent
       philantrophists and [social][ reformers][ of][ the][ time,][ namely,][ Mr.][ Samuel]
      Smith, who, [after][ serving][ his][ apprenticeship,][ commenced][ l)usiness]
      on his own account in 1860. In the spring of 1863 he visited
      Bombay, and made [a][ tour][ through] the cotton districts of that
       Presidency. He published an[ account] of his observations and
       investigations in an [interesting][ series][ of][ letters][ in][ the][ L'lverpndJ][ Ijaihj]
        Post, which were [subsec|uently][ reprinted][ in][ the][ form][ of][ a][ pamphlet.]
     Amongst other conclusions at which he arri\ed was the im-
       portant one [that][ the][ estimated][ i)roduction][ of][ cotton][ in][ India][ had]
       hitherto been [greatly][ exaggerated.] Indian economists and statis-
        ticians had been[ in][ the][ habit][ of][ estimating][ the cotton][ croj;][ of][ the]
       peninsula at from[ 5,000,000] to 7,500,000 bales of 400 lbs. each.
     As late as 1859 Dr. Forbes Watson estimated the yield at
       6,000,000 bales. Mr. Smith, however, came to the conclusion
       that the total [amount][ grown][ never][ equalled][ 2,000,000][ bales] ; [and]
        his [conclusions] [were][ fully][ borne][ out][ by][ the][ investigations][ made]
       in all parts [of][ India][ in] 1869, by Mr. [Rivett-Carnac,] the Govern-
      ment Cotton [Commissioner,][ who][ estimated][ the][ crop][ at][ 2,297,000]
        bales, including 1,590,000 Ijales in the Presidency of Bombay
      and the [districts][ tributary][ thereto.] Shortly after his return from
        India, Mr. [Smith][ and][ his][ brother,][ Mr.][ James][ Smith,][ entered][ into]
       partnership [with] Mr. Edward Edwai'ds (who had been l)rought
      up in [the] [house][ of][ Haywood][ and][ M'Viccar,][ and had][ for][ seA'eral][ years]
      been in [bnsiness][ on][ his][ own] account,) under the style of Smith,
       Edw^ards, and [Co.] This was on the 1st January, 1864, Later
      on Mr. [John][ Briscoe][ was][ admitte<l] ; then followed Mr. Anthony

     Mr. John Trevor was admitted a partner. Some years ago Mr.
     Samuel Smith became a partner in the old and eminent Glasgow,
     London, and East Indian firm of James Finlay and Co., a branch
      of Avhich house was established in Liverpool, but he still remained
     senior partner in the firm of Smith, Edwards, and Co. Mr.
     George M'Ferran Avas Vice-President of the Cotton Brokers'
     Association at the time of its amalgamation with the Cotton
     Exchange.
      At the very outset of his career, and before commencing
      TDUsiness on his own account, Mr. Smith successfully essayed to
     Tjecome an authority in the Cotton Market. His first efforts in
       "this direction took the form of occasional letters to the Liverpool
     Daily Post, over the signature of "Mercator." These letters
      ••attracted considerable attention, and at once made their mark as
     able and exhaustive examinations of the cotton situation for the
     time being. After a while they were followed by the Monthly
      'Circulars, which soon gained for their author a great reputation
      in all the cotton markets of the world. The circulars were
     issued regularly every month until the end of 1883, when they
     were discontinued in order to enable Mr. Smith to give more time
     and attention to his new duties as one of the Members of Parlia-
    ment for Liverpool. Mr. Smith is a Justice of the Peace for the
     City ; his brother, Mr. James Smith, is a Justice of the Peace for
     the Hundred of Wirral; his late pai^tner, Mr. Edwards, is also a
     J. P. for the City.
       The firm of HayAvoodand M'Viccar (with Avhom Mr. Edwards
     served his apprenticeship) Avas founded in 1812, by Mr. Francis
    HayAvood (Avhose father had been in business as a merchant before
     the close of the last century). SonieAA'here about 1834 he Avas
     joined by Mr. Joseph RidgAvay, (HayAvood and Eidgway.) This
     partnership terminated in 1837 or 1838, and Mr. HayAvoodAvas
     joined by Mr. Duncan M'Viccar, (Haywood and M'Viccar.) Mr.
    HayAvood Avas a man of ripe scholarship, and of considerable
      linguistic acquirements and varied literary tastes. His annual
     reports on the cotton trade Avere models of elegant diction and
     sound economic reasoning. He performed the difficult task of

        translating into English Kant's ["] Cretique of Pure Eeason [;"] and
      when the Cotton Market was idle, he si)ent his spare time in the-
       perusal of some of his favourite classical authors, of whose works
       he always had a few volumes in his private office. (^)
              (^) The late Mr, James Lea served his appi'enticeship with Mr. Francis-
       Haywood, and commenced business in 1821, with offices in Rumford Street.
        )Somewhere about 1839 he was joined by Mr. William Henry Waddington,
       and the firm became Lea and Waddington. In 1856 Mr. Thomas Henry
       Walthew, who had been connected with the firm since 1827, first as appren-
          tice and subsequently as salesman, was taken into partnei'ship, and the
         style was changed to Lea, Waddington, and Walthew. In 18(35 Mr.
       Waddington retired, and the firm became Lea and Walthew, which it still
        remains. Mr. Walthew died in 1880, and the business is now carried on
       by the only remaining member, Mr. Andrew M'Donald, who commenced
         his apprenticeship with the firm in 1870, and succeeded to the business on
        tho death of Mr. Walthew. Mr. A. R. Houghton was brought up in the
        house of Haywood and M'Viccar. He commenced biisiness in 1858. In
        1860 he was joined by Mr. Patrick Vance (previously in partnership with
       Mr. Edgar Musgrove), and the style became Houghton, Vance, and Co.
        There were subsequently several changes, and at the time when the
        Cotton Brokers' Association and the Cotton Exchange amalgamated
        Mr. Houghton and Mr. Vance were in business separately. Mr. Edward
        Melladew, son of the late Alderman Melladew, also graduated fi'om the
        house of Haywoods. He commenced business in 1866, along with Mr,.
       Thomas Clarke (Melladew and Clarke), who was brought up in the
        house of Schofield and Blackburn, founded by Mr. Benjamin Schofield, a
        Rochdale cotton spinner, in 1840, Mr. Blackburn joining him some years
          later. Air. Philip H. Schofield served his apprenticeship ^ith tliis latter firm,
       and commenced business on his own account in 1871. Another apprentice
       was Mr. Richard Hulse, who also began business in 1871.

       Littledale and his cousin, Mi'. Isaac Littledale (the latter was
      brother and the former cousin of the celebrated Mr. Justice
       Littledale), under the style of T. and I. Littledale. Their
         first counting-house was in Lower Castle Street. Mr. Thomas

       cousin dwelt in Parr Street, Wolstenholme Square. Later on
        the}' both removed to Bold Street, and subsequently to Colquitt
       Street. In 1808 they remoA'ed their countingdiouse to Exchange
       Buildings. In 1825 Mr. Isaac Littledale retired, and Mr. Harold
       Littledale (nephew of Isaac), and Mr Eichard Aspinall, salesman
      with the old firm, were taken into partnership. The style was
      then changed to T. and E. Littledale and Co., and has not since
      undergone any alteration. Mr. Harold Littledale was an
       apprentice with the old firm. His indentures were for seven
       years (the customary period in those days), and they dated
      from January 1st, 1820, so that he l)ecame a j^ai'tner nearly
       eighteen months before the expiration of his term of apprentice-
        ship. Young Ml'. Littledale had charge of the cotton department,
     and the story goes that while the .inflation which preceded the
      panic of 1825 was at its height Mr. John Bolton, the fine old
       colonel (who was one of Messrs. Littledale's principal constituents,
     and was, moreover, related to them hy marriage), being, as usual,
      anxious to "get out" at the top of the market, and having a
      shrewd idea that the "top" was close at hand, promised Harold
      that if he succeeded in promptly clearing out a particular shipment
        of 1,500 Demeraras at ]8d. per lb. or thereabouts, he would
      persuade Mr. Tom Littledale to take him into partnership at once
       (for of course it was in contemplation that sooner or later he
     would become a partner). The smart salesman soon fulfilled his
       part of the bargain, and sure enough the partnership followed.

      This is fifty-nine years ago, but tlie same energetic Harold'
       Littleclale is yet amongst us, and, though in his eighty-third year,
         is still the head of a great firm, besides being the embodiment
      and the representative of the times when the word of every
      merchant and broker, even in the matter of the smallest
        detail, iras his bond ; when the merchants and brokers were
      true to each other ; and when the perpetration of the con-
      temptible practices noAv either virtually sanctioned, or passed
      over without adequate condemnation, would have secured!
       for the guilty a rapid journej^ to Coventry. Mr. Thomas-
       Littledale, jun. (son of the head of the firm), was admitted a
      partner on the 1st January, 1842. On the 1st January, 1844,,
          J\Ir. Eichard Aspinall retired, and Mr. John Torr (subsequently
     member for the borough), Avas admitted. Mr. John Bolton
       Littledale, brother of Thomas jun., and second son of the head
       of the firm, was admitted on the 1st January, 1847. Mr. Thomas-
       Littledale, senior, died on the 27th April, 1847. His son Thomas-
      died on the 27th March, 1861. At this date the remaining
     members of the firm were Mr. Harold Littledale, Mr. John
      Bolton Littledale, and Mr. John Torr. Mr. John Arnaud Tobin
        Avas admitted on the 1st January, 1868. Mr. Torr retired on
      the 1st January, 1870 (and died 16th Januar}-, 1880). ]\Ir.
     John Arnaud Tobin died on the 29th December, 1871. On the-
      retirement of Mr. Torr in 1870, Mr. Arthur EdAvards and[ Mr..]
      Alfred Fletcher were taken into partnership. Mr. Fletcher and
      Mr. Bolton Littledale retired on the 30th June, 1874, AA^hen Mr.
     James Aspinall Tobin and Mr. Hermann Koch Avere admitted..
      Mr. Arthur EdAvards died in 1883, and the firm now consists-
       of Mr. Harold Littledale, Mr. James Aspinall Tobin, and Mr.
     Hermann Koch. Mr. EdAvards Avas brought up in the firm, and
      succeeded Mr. Torr, first as apprentice, then as cashier, and finally
       as partner. Although of a quiet and retiring disposition, his
       genial manners, his fund of dry humour, and his thorough con-
      tempt for everything that Avas ignoble, endeared him to all Avho.

       casual]}' l)ioui;lil: into coniimmicatioii with hiin. In the course of
       his long business career he had come into contact with the principal
      business celebrities of his time, and, having a retentive memory,
      he Avas al)le to give a considerable amount of information about
      the chief mercantile and political personages Avho have come and
     gone during the past half century, while he was also able to
      supply a fund of traditional lore, anecdotal and otherwise, al^out
     prominent people who flourished many years before his own time.
      Indeed, a great deal of information contained in these pages was
      derived from Mr, Edwards's extensive and interesting remi-
       niscences.
        During the eighty-eight years which have elapsed since the
      Messrs. Littledale commenced .business, about two hundred and
       fifty apprentices have passed through their offices and salerooms,
      being an average of about three per annum. A considerable
     number of these are now engaged in mercantile pui'suits abroad,
    many others are still amongst us, but a large number have "gone
      over to the majority." One of the most eminent was the late
      Kev. James Aspinall, M.A., Eector of Althorpe. Mr. Aspinall
     was the son of John Bridge Aspinall, Esq., who was Mayor of
      Liverpool in 1803, and who at that time, and for some years
      previously, resided in Duke Street, where Master James was born
       in 1796. In course of time (January 1st, 1811), young Aspinall
     was apprenticed to Messrs. Littledale and Co. He fell in love
       A\ith a (hiughter of one of the members of the Lake familj', who,
       in the last century and the beginning of the present century,
      "Were eminent merchants and leading members of society, and
      were, moreover, for a time neighbours of the Aspinalls in Duke
       Street. The attachment was fully reciprocated by the young
        lad}-, but as she had always had a desire to be the wife of a
      clergyman, her marriage with Mr. Aspinall, merchant or broker,
     would have seriously interfered with the realisation of her very
      amiable ambition. But young Aspinall, like a true knight of the
      olden times, promptly solved the difficulty. He obtained the
      cancelment of his indentures with Messrs. Littledale and Co., put
      on his intellectual armour, went down to Oxford, conquered the

       position desired by his lady-love, and at the close of the tourna-
     ment claimed and obtained his bride. To this union Liverpool is
      indebted for her present grave and learned Eecorder (Mr. John
      Bridge Aspinall), and for her present learned and witty Coroner
       (Mr. Clarke Aspinall). The Kev. Mr. James Aspinall's first
       ministerial appointment Avas at 8t. Michael's, Pitt Street ; he was
       shortly afterwards incumbent of St. Luke's, at the top of Bold
       Street, and finally rector of Althorpe, in Lincolnshire. He died
       in 186L He was an occasional contributor to the columns of
        llie Albion, which in his days appeared on Mondays only ; and
      he was the author of an entertaining series of sketches, entitled
       " Liverpool a Few Years Since," by ["] An Old Stager." Of this
        little volume Sir James Picton truly says that "The reminiscences
       are life-like and graphic. Every page sparkles with liveliness
     and wit." Messrs. Littledale and Co. not only supplied Liverpool
      with a clergyman, but they found also a Corporation Treasurer
      (Mr. John Wy burgh). Moreover, they have supplied two Mayors
      (Mr. Thomas Littledale, sen., and Mr. Thomas Littledale, jun.),
      and one member of Parliament (Mr. John Torr). Mr. Thomas
       Littledale, jun., was also for some years chairman of the Dock
      Board. Mr. James Aspinall Tobin was Mayor of Liverpool
       in 1 855, nineteen years prior to his becoming a partner in the
       firm of Littledale and Co. He is a Justice of the Peace for the
      County of Lancaster and City of Liverpool. Mr. Alfred Fletcher
         is a J.P for the County.
        One of the earliest of their apjjrentices (^) was Mr. John
     Wyburgh, who entered their office in 180G, and some[ }ears][ after-]
      wards, as already stated, became Treasurer to the Corporation.
                         ( ^ ) Another of Messrs. Littledale aiul Co. ['s] [apprentices][ was][ Mr.][ Walter]
      Thompson, who commenced business on his own [account][ in][ 1845,][ and][ was]
       succeeded by his brother, xMr. J. \V. Thompson, who for a time was iu
       partnership with the late Mr. Robert Bradbury, under the style of
      Thompson tind Bradljury. On tlie retirement of Mr. [Bradbuiy][ the][ style][ of]
       the firm was altered to J. W. Thompson and Co., [which][ is][ still][ retained.]
       Mr. Henry Thomas Jefferson also served his [apprenticeship][ M'ith][ Littledale]
      and Co. He commenced business on his own account in 1850. Later on
       he was joined by Mr. J. R. Taylor, who had been brought [up][ in][ the][ house]
       Whitaker, Whitehead and Co. The style of this firm was Jefferson and
        Taylor. This partnership was dissolved in January, 1805. Mr. Taylor then
       took into partnership Mr. Louis Greg, son of Mr. W. R. Greg, the well-

     Another early apprentice a\'us Mr. -lohn B. Brancker, son of P.
      AY. Brancker, Esq., who was Mayor in 1801, and who, in 1790,
      resided in Duke Street, next door to Mr. Lake, whose daughter
     married the Eev. James Aspinall. He served the old-fashioned
     term of seven years between 1810 and 1817, and after a while
     commenced business on his own account as a general broker, with
      a counting-house in Exchange Court, Exchange Street East. He
      retired from business in 1861, and Avas succeeded by his son, Mr.
     -John Brancker, Avho had been taken into partnership in 1842,
      Avhen the style was altered to J. B. Brancker and Son. Mr.
     William BoxAvell Avas admitted in 1862, and Mr. W. S. Harris
       Avas admitted in 1879. The style of the firm Avas altered in 1862
      to Brancker, BoxAvell, and Co., and has since remained Avithout

        Mr. R. C. Hall served his apprenticeship Avith J. B. Brancker
     and Son. He eventually became salesman for Mr. James Hobson.
     The latter, after having been for a short time first Avith Rushton,
     Johnson, and Co., and then Avith Eason and Barry, commenced
      business on his own account, and became a member of the Cotton
      Brokers' Association in 1847. He Avas shortly joined by Mr.
     Xorth, and the style of the firm Avas altered to North and Hobson.
     The latter retired in 1853, and Mr. Hobson then engaged Mr.
     Hall Mr. Hobson retired in 1856, and left the business to Mr
     Hall and Mr. J. P. Mello]-, as Hall and Mellor. The old firm
     bought for the North Shore Mill Company. This mill was owned
     by the brothers Brogden, Avho had married tAvo sisters, daughters
      of the preA'ious proprietor of the mill, avIio had taken it over from
      the original shareholders. The Messrs. Brogden had just brought

          ]\Ir. Greg withdrew, and Mr. Taylor took into partnership Mr. John Tliorley

      from Taylor, 8ykes, and Co.'s office.] Mr. J. E. Sheppard, another of
       Littledale and Co.'s apprentices, commenced business in 1851. He was for
      a while a partner with Mr. Hyslop, the style being Sheppard and Hyslop.
      This partneiship was dissolved some time ago, and since then Mr. Sheppard
      has conducted the business on his own account. Another apprentice of
       Littledale and Co. is Mr. J. R. Kewley, who is now a partner in the firm

      The firm of Hall and Mellor purchased [considerable] quantities-
       of cotton for shipment to New York and Boston during the-
      American war. In 1862 the total export to the States was-
       52,000 bales; in the same year only 62,000 bales, [chiefly] blockade
       cotton, were imported. At the end of 1863 the firm dissolved.
      They had dealt largely in American and Egyptian, and, oni
       separating, Mr. Mellor went chiefly into the Egyptian business,
      under the style of Mellor and Co., while Mr. Hall went[ chiefly]
       into American. Mr. Mellor became a partner in the Alexandria
       firm of Choremi, Mellor, and Co. He retired some years ago.
      Meanwhile, Mr. Thomas Davies, who had for some time been
       out in Alexandria, was taken into partnership. The present

                        IV.
        Ninet}' to one hundred yeavB ago there Avas a very fair
     quantity of cotton imported into Lancaster, chiefi}' from the
     AVest Indies. In 1788 the arrivals reached 6,000 bales, against
       "2-l-,000 impoi^ted into Liverpool ; in 1791 the figures were 10,000
      bales and 68,000 bales respectively. The cotton imported into
     Lancaster was sold sometimes direct to consumers, who paid
      occasional visits to the county capital in search of raw material
     but the Iwlk of it was sold to merchants or dealers for resale
      in Preston, Blackburn, Bolton, Manchester, &c. Amongst the
     merchants whose place of business was in Lancaster, during the
      closing years of the last centur}', was Mr. Richard Bateson. He
     frequently sold cotton to the leading spinners of those days ; [but]
     there was one transaction about the result of which he was very
     proud. During one of the high-priced periods he purchased a lot
      of 130 bags West Indian at 24d. per lb. The cotton had just
      arrived, and he had examined the bales on the quay. His partner
     expressed some doubts as to the wisdom of buying so much cotton
      at so high a price ; [but][ young][ Bateson][ was][ sanguine][ of][ being][ able]
      to find a customer at a good pi'ofit. In a day or two came one
      of the Arkwrights, to whom the lot was offered at 30d. per lb.
    The great spinner pooh-poohed the notion of paying such an
     extravagant price, no matter how good the cotton. Business in
     Manchester, said he, was so Avretched that he could not sell any
      j^arn ; and under siich circumstances he would not buy cotton.
     Nevertheless, after examining the bales, or bags, as they were in
     those days, and after a great deal of haggling, during which he
    made various bids, from 24d. per lb. upAvards, he took the lot at
     28d. per lb. : thereby justifying the judgment and foresight of
     the young merchant.
        In the course of a few years it became apparent that the
    West Indian and American trades were concentrating themselves
      in Liverpool ; and to that port, therefore, Mr. Bateson betook

     He entered into partnership with Mr. Thomas Lowndes, jun., who,
       since 1800, had been a partner in the firm of Meek and Lowndes,
      but which partnership was dissolved in 1S06. The style of the
     new firm was Lowndes and Bateson, and they did business both as
      meixhants and brokers AVhen Mr. Bateson came from Lancaster
       he was accompanied by his nephew, Mr. James Bateson, who
      became a j^artner in the new firm in 1811, when the style was
       altered to Lowndes, Bateson, and Co. Mr. Lowndes died at
     Hamburg in 1815 ; and, in 1816, the style of the firm became
      Richard Bateson and Co. The oflfice was at the top of AVatcr
        Street. There Avas no change until 1833, in which year Mr.
      James Bateson retired from the firm and joined Mr. Roljert H.
       Horsfall (^) (Bateson and Horsfall). Simultaneously Mr. Bateson's
      two sons (James Glynne Bateson and Richaixl Wilding Bateson)
      were taken into partnership, and the style became Richard
       Bateson and Sons. In 1843 Mr. James Glynne Bateson (') with-
      drew and established a firm on his own account. ]n 1848 (on
       the retirement of Mr. R. W. Bateson) Mr. Bateson's nephew, Mi-.
       Philip Henry Chambres (one of (Gladstone and Serjeantson's
       apprentices) was taken into partnership, and the style was altered

        names. From 1833 to 1840 Mr. Shand continued the business in his own
       name. In the last named year he was succeeded by his cousin, Mr. William
       Walcott Shand, who, along with Mr. John Higson and Mr. Timothy Br istow
       Hughes, continued the business under the style of Shand, Higson, and
       Hughes. On the retirement of Mr. Hughes in 1846, the style was changed
         to Shand, Higson, and Co. , and has not since been altered. Mr. Peter
       Swinton Boult was admitted a partner in I.['•54] ; Mr. Higson retired at the
       end of 1883. Mr. Herbert S. Boult was admitted in January, 1885. Mr.
        Boult was President of the Cotton Brokers' Association in 1868. Mr. John
        Bridson, the eminent singer, served his apjirenticeship with Shand, Higson,
       and Co., and was for several years in business on his own account. Tlie
         late Mr. Alfred Andersson was also brought up in the house of Shand,
        Higson, and Co. In )862 he entered into parinersh p M'ith Mr. (leorge

       was joined by Mr. Richard A. Hilton from Manchester, and the style
       became Bateson and Hilton. Subsequently Mr. Augustus F. Clarke
       became a partner. Mr. Bateson died some years ago. Mr. Hilton antl
       Mr. Clarke retired in 1882 in favor of their junior partners, [Mr.] Henry

     Thomas Holder (brought up with Mr. Bateson) was admitted,
     and the style became Bateson, Chambres, and Co. In I860'
     (October 2nd) Mr. Bateson retired. In the circular announcing
      his retirement he said :
           I beg to acquaint you that I have this day retired from business, and
      that the partnership of Bateson, Chambres, and Co. is dissolved. In making
       this announcement I vi'ish to express to my numerous friends my cordial
      thanks for the great kindness and support which I have received at their
      hands ; [and][ I] [have][ also][ to][ acknowledge][ with] much thankfulness the general
       confidence and favour which have been shown me throughout my commercial
        life—a period of seventy-three years.
     Mr. Bateson was in his ninetieth year when he issued this
       circular, which extraordinary circumstance, and the great esteem
      in which he was held, caused his fellow brokers to present to
     him the following address :
     To EicHAED Bateson, Esq.,
        The Associated Cotton Brokers have observed with great interest the
     announcement of your retirement from business, an interest fully justified
        Jjy the fact that you are the oldest member of the Association, have been 73
      years in business, and in a few months will be 90 years of age ; they cannot,
       therefore, allow you to withdraw without the expression of their sincere
       respect for the integrity and courtesy that liave characterised your dealings,
      with them, and of earnest hope that you may be spared many years to
      enjoy that quiet which you have so well earned.
              Signed on behalf the Association,
                         James H. Macrae, President.
                                                              , Samuel Gath, Vice-President.
                             Sti'dley Martix, Secretary.
        Liverpool, October, 1860.
     Mr. Bateson died in 1863, aged 93. On the day upon which he
      retired the style of the firm was altered to Chambres, Holder,
     and Co. On the same day Mr. William Chambres (brother of Mr.
      P, H. Chaml)res) was admitted a partner. He had been brous'ht
     up in the cotton trade (being one of Marriott and Co.'s apprentices)
     and had gained further experience in the saleroom of Eichard
     Bateson and Sons, and in the United States ; but prior to joining
      the firm of Chambres, Holder, and Co. he had been in partnership.
     with his brother, Mr. C. C. Chambres (Wm. Chambres and Co.),
      as stock and share brokers. On the death of this brother in 1866,
      he left cotton to resume and continue the business of stock and
      share broker. Mr. William Chand>res and Mr. P. H. Chambres

       are both J.P.'s for the Borough and County of Denljigh and D.L.'s
       for the Shh'e. Mr. Wm. Chambres is a J. P. for the City of Liver-
        pool, and Alderman for St. Peter's Ward. On the 1st January,
       1876, the eldest sons of the two remaining members of the firm
       of Chambres, Holder, and Co., Mr. Henry C. Chambres and
      Mr. James Holder, wei'e taken into partnership, since which there
       has been no change (\).
         Mr. Holder was President of the Cotton Brokers' Association
       in 1870. He is a Justice of the Peace for the city, and a member
                                     • of the City Coimcil for Exchange Ward. He is held in the
       highest esteem by [all] classes of the community, and by all shades
        politicians. This accounts for the gratifying circumstance that in
      November, 1883, he was elected to the high office of Mayor of
      Liverpool by the unanimous voice of the Council, although differ-
       ing in political views from the party predominant in the chamber.
