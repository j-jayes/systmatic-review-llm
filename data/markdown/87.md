          Introduction
 Much of what is written on the history of technology is for boys of all
  ages. This book is a history for grown-ups of all genders. We have lived
 with technology for a long time, and collectively we know a lot about it.
 From economists to ecologists, from antiquarians to historians, people
 have had different views about the material world around us and how
  it has changed. Yet too often the agenda for discussing the past, present
 and future of technology is set by the promoters of new technologies.
  When weare told about technology from on high we are made to think
 about novelty and the future. For many decades now the term ‘technol-
 ogy has been closely linked with invention (the creation of a new idea)
 and innovation (the first use of a new idea). Talk about technology centres
 on research and development, patents and the early stages of use, for
 which the term diffusion is used. The timelines of technological history,
 and they abound, are based on dates of invention and innovation. The
 most significant twentieth-century technologies are often reduced to
  the following: flight (1903), nuclear power (1945), contraception (1955),
 and the internet (1965). We are told that change is taking place at an ever-
 accelerating pace, and that the new is increasingly powerful. The world,
 the gurus insist, is entering a new historical epoch as a result of technol-
 ogy. In the new economy, in new times, in our post-industrial and post-
 modern condition, knowledge of the present and past is supposedly ever
  less relevant. Inventors, even in these post-modern times, are ‘ahead of
 their time’, while societies suffer from the grip of the past, resulting in a
 supposed slowness to adapt to new technology.
  There are new things under the sun, and the world is indeed changing .

     futurology has been with us a long time. In the nineteenth century
     the idea that inventors were ahead of their time and that science and
     technology were advancing faster than the ability of human society to
     cope was a commonplace. By the early twentieth century this notion
     was made academically respectable with the label ‘the cultural lag. In
      the 1950s and even later, one could claim without embarrassment that
     scientists ‘had the future in their bones’. By the end of the twentieth
     century, futurism had long been passé. The technological future was as
      it had been for a long time. Intellectuals claimed there was a new kind
     of future, one prefigured by ‘post-moderr’ architecture. Yet this new
     kind of future was to be brought about by an old-style technological
     or industrial revolution which would change everything.
      In the case of technology reheated futurism has held its appeal long
     after it was declared obsolete. The technological future marched on
      as before. Consider the case of the first successful flight of NASA’s X-
     43A space aeroplane on 27 March 2004. Although it lasted all of ten
     seconds, it made the news the world over. ‘From Kitty Hawk to the X-
     43A has been a century’s steady advance’, wrote one newspaper; from
     ‘seven miles an hour to Mach Seven is a striking indication of how far
     powered flight has travelled in a hundred years.’ Soon we would be
     enjoying, yet again, almost instant travel to Australia from London.
       Just below the surface was another history, which blew great holes in
      this old-fashioned story. Every few weeks between 1959 and 1968 B-52
     aircraft took off from Edwards Air Force Base in California, with one of
     three X-15s under their wings. Once high up the X-15s fired their rocket
     engines and were actively flown by twelve ‘research pilots’ clad in silver
     pressurised space suits, reaching speeds of Mach 6.7 and touching the
     edge of space. These hard-drinking engineer-pilots, mostly combat
     veterans (among them Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on
     the moon), looked down on mere ‘spam in the can’ astronauts, as
    Tom Wolfe observed in The Right Stuff . While the astronauts became
     famous, the elite X-15 pilots were left to lament, as one did, that in the
     early 1990s he was still ‘one of the fastest airplane pilots in the world. I
     am too old for that. Someone younger should have that honor.” Past

  and present were connected even more directly. The B-52, which took
  the X-43A and its booster rocket up, was one of the same B-52s used on
  the X-15 programmes and was now the oldest flying B-52 in the world.?
  It was built in the 1950s. Not only that, but the key technology of the X-
  43A was the scramjet, a supersonic version of the ramjet. A technique
  decades old, it was used in a 1950s-designed British anti-aircraft missile,
  the Bloodhound, which was itself in service into the 1990s. In short,
  the story might well have been ‘1950s aeroplane launches unmanned
  ramjet plane which flies a little faster than 1960s Right Stuff pilots’.

  By thinking about the history of technology-in-use a radically different
  picture of technology, and indeed of invention and innovation,
  becomes possible.* A whole invisible world of technologies appears. It
  leads to a rethinking of our notion of technological time, mapped as it
  is On innovation-based timelines. Even more importantly it alters our
  picture of which have been the most important technologies. It yields
  a global history, whereas an innovation-centred one, for all its claims
  to universality, is based on a very few places. It will give us a history
  which does not fit the usual schemes of modernity, one which refutes
  some important assumptions of innovation-centric accounts.
   The new history will be surprisingly different. For example, steam
  power, held to be characteristic of the industrial revolution, was not
  only absolutely but relatively more important in 1900 than in 1800. Even
  in Britain, the lead country of the industrial revolution, it continued
  to grow in absolute importance after that. Britain consumed much
  more coal in the 1950s than in the 1850s. The world consumed more
  coal in 2000 than in 1950 or 1900. It has more motor cars, aeroplanes,
  wooden furniture and cotton textiles than ever before. The tonnage of
  world shipping continues to increase. We still have buses, trains, radio,
  television and the cinema, and consume ever-increasing quantities,
  of paper, cement and steel. The production of books continues to
  increase. Even the key novel technology of the late twentieth century,

```

    the electronic computer, has been around for many decades. The post-
    modern world has forty-year-old nuclear power stations as well as
     fifty-year old bombers. It has more than a dash of technological retro
    about it too: it has new ocean-going passenger ships, organic food
    and classical music played on ‘authentic instruments. Aging, and even
    dead, rock stars of the 1960s still generate large sales, and children are
    brought up with Disney films seen by their grandparents when they
    were children.
     Use-centred history is not simply a matter of moving technolog-
     ical time forward. As Bruno Latour has aptly noted, modern time,
    where this behaved as moderns believed, has never existed. Time was
    always jumbled up, in the pre-modern era, the post-modern era and
    the modern era. We worked with old and new things, with hammers
    and electric drills.’ In use-centred history technologies do not only
    appear, they also disappear and reappear, and mix and match across
    the centuries. Since the late 1960s many more bicycles were produced
    globally each year than cars.° The guillotine made a gruesome return
     in the 1940s. Cable TV declined in the 1950s to reappear in the 1980s.
    The supposedly obsolete battleship saw more action in the Second
    World War than in the First. Furthermore, the twentieth century has
    seen cases of technological regression.
     A use-based history will do much more than disturb our tidy
    timelines of progress. What we take to be the most significant tech-
    nologies will change. Our accounts of significance have been pecu-
     liarly innovation-centric, and tied to particular accounts of modernity
    where particular new technologies were held to be central. In the new
     picture, twentieth-century technology is not just a matter of electric-
     ity, mass production, aerospace, nuclear power, the internet and the
    contraceptive pill. It will involve the rickshaw, the condom, the horse,
    the sewing machine, the spinning wheel, the Haber-Bosch process, the
    hydrogenation of coal, cemented-carbide tools, bicycles, corrugated
     iron, cement, asbestos, DDT, the chain saw and the refrigerator. The
    horse made a greater contribution to Nazi conquest than the V2.

  invention, is that alternatives exist for nearly all technologies: there
  are multiple military technologies, means of generating electricity,
  powering a motor car, storing and manipulating information, cutting
  metal or roofing a building. Too often histories are written as if no
  alternative could or did exist.
   One particularly important feature of use-based history of tech-
  nology is that it can be genuinely global. It includes all places that
  use technology, not just the small number of places where invention
  and innovation is concentrated. In the innovation-centric account,
  most places have no history of technology. In use-centred accounts,
  nearly everywhere does. It gives us a history of technology engaged
  with all the world’s population, which is mostly poor, non-white
  and half female. A use-perspective points to the significance of novel
  technological worlds which have emerged in the twentieth century

    and which have hitherto had no place in histories of technology.
    Among them are the new technologies of poverty. They are missed
    because the poor world is thought of as having traditional local
    technologies, a lack of rich-world technologies, and/or has been
    subject to imperial technological violence. When we think of cities
    we should think of bidonvilles as well as Alphaville; we should think
    not just about the planned cities of Le Corbusier, but the unplanned
    shanty towns, built not by great contractors, but by millions of self-
    builders over many years. These are worlds of what I call ‘creole’
    technologies, technologies transplanted from their place of origin
    finding uses on a greater scale elsewhere.
     A consequence of the new approach is that we shift attention
    from the new to the old, the big to the small, the spectacular to the
    mundane, the masculine to the feminine, the rich to the poor. But at
     its core is a rethinking of the history of all technology, including the
    big, spectacular, masculine high technologies of the rich white world.
    For all the critiques, we do not in fact have a coherent production-
     ist, masculine, materialist account of technology and history in the
    twentieth century. We have big questions, and big issues to address,
    which are surprisingly open.
     A use-centred account also refutes some well-established conclu-
    sions of innovation-centric history. For example, it undermines the
    assumption that national innovation determines national success;
    the most innovative nations of the twentieth century have not been
    the fastest growing. Perhaps the most surprising criticism that arises
    from the use perspective is that innovation-centric history gives us
     an inadequate account of invention and innovation. Innovation-
    centric history focuses on the early history of some technologies
    which became important later. The history of invention and innova-
    tion needs to focus on all inventions and innovations at a particular
    time, independently of their later success or failure. It needs to look
    too to invention and innovation in all technologies, not just those
    favoured by being well known and assumed to be the most significant.
    Traditional innovation-centric histories have space for Bill Gates,

  2. The United States became one of the richest agricultural nations in the world partly
   by creating highly mechanised, but animal-powered, agriculture. Here a farmer
  drives a team of twenty mules pulling a combine harvester through the wheat fields of
  Walla Walla County, Washington in 1941. By this time the tractor had been displacing
          horses and mules in some areas for twenty-five years.
  but a history of invention and innovation would also include Ingvar
 Kamprad, who made his money from mass-producing and selling
 wooden furniture. He founded IKEA and is, some think, richer than
  Gates. More importantly, our histories need to have a place for the
 majority of failed inventions and innovations. Most inventions are
  never used; many innovations fail.
   The innovation-centric view also misleads us as to the nature of
  scientists and engineers. It presents them, as they present themselves,
  as creators, designers, researchers. Yet the majority have always been
 mainly concerned with the operation and maintenance of things and
 processes; with the uses of things, not their invention or development. .

     Given the importance of innovation-centric futurism in discussing
     technology, history can be an especially powerful tool for rethink-
     ing technology. History reveals that technological futurism is largely
    unchanging over time. Present visions of the future display a startling,
     unselfconscious lack of originality. Take the extraordinary litany
     of technologies which promised peace to the world. Communica-
     tions technologies, from railways and steamships, to radio and the
     aeroplane, and now the internet, seemed to make the world smaller
     and bring people together, ensuring a perpetual peace. Technologies of
     destruction, such as the great ironclad battleships, Nobel’s explosives,
     the bomber aircraft and the atomic bomb were so powerful that they
     too would force the world to make peace. New technologies of many
     sorts would emancipate the downtrodden. The old class system would
     wither under the meritocracy demanded by new technology; racial
     minorities would gain new opportunities — as chauffeurs in the motor
     age, pilots in the air age, and computer experts in the information age.
    Women were to be liberated by new domestic technologies, from the
    vacuum cleaner to the washing machine. The differences between
     nations would evaporate as technology overcame borders. Political
     systems too would converge as technology, inevitably, became the same
     everywhere. The socialist and capitalist worlds would become one.
      In order to be at all convincing these arguments had to deny their
    own history, and they did so to a remarkable extent. The obliteration of
     even recent history has been continuous and systematic. For example,
     in the middle of 1945 the bomber ceased to be a peace-creating tech-
     nology; the atomic bomb took its place. When we think of informa-
     tion technology we forget about postal systems, the telegraph, the
     telephone, radio and television. When we celebrate on-line shopping,
     the mail-order catalogue goes missing. Genetic engineering, and its
     positive and negative impacts, is discussed as if there had never been
     any other means of changing animals or plants, let alone other means
     of increasing food supply. A history of how things were done in the
     past, and of the way past futurology has worked, will undermine most
    contemporary claims to novelty.

```

   We need to be aware that this futurology of the past has affected our
  history. From it we get our focus on invention and innovation, and
  on the technologies which we take to be the most important. From
   this literature, the work of low- and middle-ranking intellectuals
  and propagandists, ranging from, say, the books of H. G. Wells to the
  press releases of NASA’s PR officials, we get a whole series of clichéd
  claims about technology and history. We should take them, not as
  well-grounded contributions to our understanding, for they rarely are
  that, but as the basis of questions. What have been the most signifi-
  cant technologies of the twentieth century? Has the world become a
  global village? Has culture lagged behind technology? Has technology
  had revolutionary or conservative social and political effects? Has new
  technology been responsible for the dramatic increase in economic
  output in the last hundred years? Has technology transformed war?
  Has the rate of technical change been ever increasing? These are
  some of the questions this book will try to answer, but they cannot
  be answered within the innovation-centric frame in which they are
  usually asked.
   These questions become much easier to answer if we stop thinking
  about ‘technology’, but instead think of ‘things. Thinking about the
  use of things, rather than of technology, connects us directly with
  the world we know rather than the strange world in which ‘technol-
  ogy’ lives. We speak of ‘our’ technology, meaning the technology of
  an age or a whole society. By contrast ‘things’ fit into no such totality,
  and do not evoke what is often taken as an independent historical
  force. We discuss the world of things as grown-ups, but technology
  as children. For example, we all know that while the use of things is
  widely distributed through societies, ultimate control of things and
  their use has been highly concentrated, within societies and between
  societies. Ownership, and other forms of authority, on the one hand,
  and use on the other, have been radically separated. Most people in the
  world live in houses that do not belong to them, work in workplaces
  belonging to others, with tools that belong to others, and indeed many
  of the things they apparently own are often tied to credit agreements.

```
    Within societies, states and/or small groups have had disproportion-
     ate control; some societies have much more stuff than others. In many
    places of the world much is owned by foreigners. Things belong to
    particular people in ways which technology does not.

          Significance
  Is the condom more significant in history than the aeroplane? We all
 know that technology has made an enormous difference to the history
  of the twentieth century. But just how important is difficult, perhaps
 impossible, to assess. When it had the greatest effect is also difficult to
  assess. Can one distinguish between technological and other changes?
 What is the appropriate measure of significance? Is it a quantitative
 measure, perhaps of economic impact, or some qualitative estimate of
  social or cultural effect? Is cultural significance to be measured by the
 presence of a technology in the movies, the pages of newspapers, and
 the works of intellectuals? Or can we detect it even when a technology
 hardly resonates at all at these levels? The aeroplane is by this measure
 very culturally significant, the condom insignificant. Once we start
 thinking seriously about these questions we will open up the history
 of twentieth-century technology to many fresh insights.
  Our world abounds with seemingly authoritative stories of which
 technologies have been most significant, and when. They focus on a
 small number of cases. For the years up to around 1940 electricity,
 motor cars and aviation are conventionally deemed to be the most
 important. The period of the Second World War and later is seen as
 the age of nuclear power, computers, space rockets and the internet.'
 Sometimes biotechnologies, including new foods, medicines and con- .
  traceptives (the Pill), are part of these narratives, as are chemicals.” To
 be sure there are variants. Thus [in ][one ] [account ] [1895 ] [to ] [1940 ] [was ] [the ]

        3. Rocketry was, from the very beginning, a very public technology. Its public
      prominence has led to an exaggerated idea of its significance to history, especially
      for the 1940s and 1950s. Here photographers record the first launch from what was
      later known as Cape Canaveral on 24 July 1950. The rocket was a ‘Bumper V-2) a

     period of electrification; 1941 to the late twentieth century was the era
     of motorisation; and this was followed by the age of computerisation
     of the economy.’
      These accounts bear an uncanny resemblance to claims for sig-
     nificance made long before any historical analysis could be carried
     out. One analyst, writing in 1948, thought that the world had already
     gone through three industrial revolutions associated with particu-
     lar technologies. The first depended on iron, steam and textiles; the
     second on chemistry, large industries, steel and new communications;
     and the third, still under way in 1948, was ‘the age of electrification,
     automatic machinery, electric control over manufacturing processes,
     air transport, radios and so on. A fourth was on the way: ‘with the

  we face an even more staggering fourth Industrial Revolution) he
  claimed.‘ In the 1950s some believed that there had been a ‘scientific
  revolution’ which followed the original industrial revolution. This had
  started in the early- to mid-twentieth century and was associated with
  aeroplanes, electronics and atomic power. For others a third industrial
  revolution, of which the ‘warning signs’ appeared in the 1940s, was
  based on nuclear energy and electronically controlled automation.®
  In the Soviet Union the idea of a ‘Scientific-Technical Revolution’,
  centred on automation, became Communist party doctrine from the
  mid-1960s.° More recently, analysts have tended to highlight what they
  see as a radical transition from an industrial society to a post-indus-
  trial, or information, society brought about through the actions of the
  digital computer and the internet. In this context, some economists
  have developed the idea that economic history has been shaped by a
  very few ‘general-purpose technologies’. The central ones are succes-
  sively steam power, electricity and now information and communica-
  tion technologies (ICT).
   How seriously should we take these claims for these technologies,
  and for their significance in these particular periods? The answer is
  that such accounts, for all that they reflect what we think we know,
  are not as well founded as might be supposed. They are clearly inno-
  vation-centric in their chronology, implying that the impact of the
  technologies comes with innovation and early use. That is not the
  only problem. What is the basis for the choice of the general-purpose
  technologies, and how solidly does it rest? Why the steam engine, for
 example? Why not the heat engine, ranging from the reciprocating
  steam engine to petrol and diesel engines, to the gas and steam turbines?
  Similarly, what does electricity mean? It clearly includes lighting and
  traction, and perhaps industrial uses. But does it include electronics,
 where there is hardly a substitute? Can we think of telephony, telegra-
 phy, radio, radar and television without electricity? Yet if ‘electricity’ .
  is to include these, how does one differentiate ‘electricity’ from ICT?
 Which leads to the question, what exactly is meant by ICT? Just as

     importantly we need to ask why other technologies are not on the list.
     There are many other pervasive technologies to choose from, from
     the working of metal (the lathe or the milling machine might be good
     cases), to synthetic organic chemistry or metallurgy.
      While there is enough consistency of choice to suggest a common
     understanding, there is enough variation in dates and arguments to
     suggest no detailed analysis of significance lies at the root of these
     choices. The lack of any surprises in the standard lists of technologies
     chosen suggests that what they are linked by is high cultural visibility
     and that they have long been claimed to be central to the history of
     the twentieth century. The technological boosterism of the past has
     too often been turned into the history of our material world.
      Occasionally radio programmes, magazines or newspapers ask their
     publics or experts for their choice of the most important invention in
     history. The results are invariably quirky, easily challengeable and often
      silly. Part of the British radio-listening public responded to an old-
     fashioned techno-boosterist series of lectures with a vote that made
     the bicycle easily the most significant technical innovation since 1800.
    Water-treatment and supply systems topped the list of most benefi-
     cial technologies, and the washing machine was the most significant
     domestic technology.’ Such polls have the virtue of forcing us to think
     and to challenge the consensus views about which technologies have
     been the most significant.
    Assessing technologies
    How should claims for technological importance be assessed? First, it is
     essential to distinguish between the innovation itself and use. In most
     cases the choice of significant technology is not only highly selective,
     but dating of significance is highly innovation-centric. The process
     of invention, development and innovation is sometimes enormously
     expensive. Sometimes these costs are recovered and indeed surpluses
     made, but the benefits (and sometimes increased costs) come only
     from later use. The time of maximum use is typically decades away
     from invention, or indeed innovation. For example, electricity and car

  usage are still increasing, more than a century from innovation. This
  issue was partly recognised in response to an intriguing problem. The
  rate of growth of the economies of the rich countries was slower in
  the 1970s, 1980s and indeed 1990s than it had been in the long boom
  of the 1950s and 1960s, yet everyone was saying that new technology
  was changing things radically. As an economist put it, information
  technology was everywhere except in the productivity data. One
  reaction was to claim that the data were wrong, they could not capture
  the transformations wrought by information technology; statistical
  offices — long used to taking account of quality changes — looked
  closely at their assumptions and techniques, but decided they were
  recording the effects. Another response was that the impact of ICT,
   like that of electricity, would be felt much later than an innovation-
  centric approach suggested. In other words, the timing of the revolu-
  tion was all wrong, perhaps by many decades. But the dates are just
  the beginning of the problem, for it is not just a matter of when, but
  of which technology, and how big the effect is.
  Use is not enough
  Significance is not the same as pervasiveness or usefulness. Under-
  standing the difference between use and usefulness, between pervasive-
  ness and significance, is essential. Economic historians of technology
  have done just this. They argue that the significance of a technol-
  ogy for an economy is the difference between the cost or benefit of
  using a technology and that of the best alternative. Thus Robert Fogel
  assessed the importance of nineteenth-century US railways not by
  assuming that without them people and goods would be impossible to
  transport, but by comparing railways with other means of transporta-
  tion, including canals and horse-drawn wagons. He found, in a rough
  calculation, that railways increased the output of the US economy as
  it stood in 1890 by less than 5 per cent of GDP. Since the American
  economy was growing very fast at the time, this was the equivalent of
  saying that without railways the US economy would have had to wait
  until 1891 or 1892 to achieve the output it reached with railways in

     1890.8 Twentieth-century motorisation, or electrification, or the role
    of civil aviation, has not been subject to such detailed assessments,
    yet we can imagine productive worlds without the motor car or the
    aeroplane, (though a world without electricity, in some respects only,
     is a different matter). Rockets and atomic power, so beloved in the
    1950s and 1960s as world-transforming technologies, are as likely to
    have made the world poorer rather than richer once all the costs and
    benefits have been computed.
     Many object to this kind of counterfactual history — one which
    invokes something which did not happen — as unsatisfactory. And so
     it is. Yet it is inescapable if we want to assess significance sensibly.
    For most assessments already have an implicit, hidden counterfactual
    assumption which is usually critical to the argument.
     The hidden counterfactual assumption which lies behind the
    equation of use and significance is that there was no alternative. Two
    anecdotal examples illustrate this: an article in the press imagined
    what the world would have been like without computers; the conclu-
    sion was that it would barely work at all, and therefore that computers
    were extraordinarily significant.’ This is the equivalent of asking what
    would happen if all existing (electronic digital) computers suddenly
    stopped working. The second example is a television programme of
    the last years of the twentieth century about a Japanese management
    guru who believed that the internet was bringing about a new era of
    global citizenship.'® This was put to the test by interviewing him in
    San Francisco, but using the internet. The link kept breaking down,
    and was in any case of low quality. The presenter poked some mild
    fun at the unfortunate sage, but missed the real joke. The capacity to
    communicate with someone in San Francisco has existed for a long
    time. As far back as the late nineteenth century one could have com-
    municated by telegraph; the long-distance telephone was available
    from the early twentieth. The message about citizens of the world, the
    borderless market and so on, would have been the same.
     One of the most dramatic changes in price over the twentieth
    century was that of electronic communication, resulting in drastic

```

```
 reduction in the real costs of telephone calls (some 99 pericent);
 and making possible the mass transmission of other data (as in the
 internet). Similarly, the case of the computer-less world assumes no
 alternative to computers, but we would use alternatives and do things
 differently. Of course, computers do things better than alternatives,
 and for many uses of computers there may well be no alternative, but
 that is exactly what one needs to catch hold of. The question is not
 what computers do, but how well they do it, and what they can do that
 cannot be done otherwise.
   Precisely because of the fecundity of invention there usually have
 been comparable alternatives. There were computing machines
 before electronic computers. Punched-card machines were used for
 large-scale data processing, mathematical calculations were done
 with teams of ‘computers’ calculating with machines, often electric
 ones. Slide-rules were important tools in the design workshop — the
 large industrial versions were far removed from those for school use.
 Digital electronic computers were preceded by mechanical analogue
 computers, from tide predictors to differential analysers. Electronic
 analogue computers played a vital role, along with digital computers,
 in the design of complex systems for decades after the Second World
 War. Telecommunications existed before the internet: the telegraph
 continued to carry large amounts of long-distance traffic into the
 years after the Second World War. The telephone and the radio were
 widely used. Television by cable and by high-frequency radio trans-
 mission has been around for decades. There was sound reproduction
 before the CD: wax cylinders, shellac and vinyl records, wire and tape
 recorders all worked. There is more than one way to skin a cat, to
 fight a war, to generate energy. Yet, these alternatives are often difficult
 to imagine, even when they exist. I remember asking engineering
 students in the mid-1980s what alternatives there were to satellites
 for long-distance telecommunication but they could find none. This
 was exactly the moment when the world was once again being girdled
 with cables — not the copper cables with repeaters of the great era
 of telegraph, but with fibre-optic cables. Alternatives are everywhere,

```

```
     though they are often invisible. Invention, and human ingenuity in
     using inventions, means that we should compare with alternatives,
     but because the world changes in so many ways it is extremely difficult
      to compare with past or alternative worlds.
      The hidden counterfactual assumption that there was no alterna-
      tive is an extreme one; the more common assumption is that there was
     no comparable alternative: the newest was radically more effective,
     efficient, powerful and generally better than what it superseded. But
     to become widely used, a thing does not have to be massively better
     than what preceded it; it need only be marginally better than alterna-
     tives (assuming for the moment that better technologies will replace
     worse ones). In some cases, often taken to be trivial, we understand
     this without difficulty. The paper-clip is ubiquitous not because it is
     an earth-shatteringly important technology. Indeed its very ubiquity,
     simplicity, its unchanging design over decades, the fact that it does not
     move at huge speed or consume vast quantities of energy, all seem to
     point to it being a minor technology. Crucially we know we can do
     without paper-clips. As a result of invention we have a remarkable
     repertoire of paper-collating technologies, each adapted to very par-
     ticular uses. There are many ways of holding paper together: pin it,
     staple it, punch holes and secure it with “Treasury tags’, use Sellotape,
     put it in a ring-bind or other sort of folder, or bind it into a book.!! We
     use paper-clips so much because they are, for many uses, marginally
     better than alternatives, and we know this.
     Technological choice
     The assumption that the new is much superior to older methods is
     widespread. Thus alternating current (AC) electrical systems were
     assumed to be superior to direct current (DC) systems in the so-called
     battle of the electrical systems in the late nineteenth century. So they
     were, in some respects, but not all. In any case, the big choice lay not
     in an irrefutable demonstration of the superiority of one over the
     other, but the belief that AC would be better in the long run, a belief
     that became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Although, in fact, not entirely:

```

-----

```
  DC systems remained in operation for many years, and new ones were
  installed. They were also continuously developed in specialist areas.
  One of the major advantages adduced for AC was the lower cost of
  transmission, yet in particular cases, for example underwater trans-
  mission, high-voltage DC has been used, including in the first and
  second English Channel electric links between Britain and France,
  dating back to 1961.
   The assumption that the new is clearly superior to what went before
  has an important corollary: failure to move from one to the other is to
  be explained by ‘conservatism, not to mention stupidity or straight-
  forward ignorance. ‘Resistance to new technology’ becomes a problem
  to be addressed by psychologists, sociologists, even historians.!* But
  the idea of ‘resistance’ makes sense only if there are no alternatives. It
  is absurd to talk of resistance to technology or innovation in a world
  where individuals or societies simply could not accept every innova-
  tion, or indeed product, on offer. Resistance is required. In choosing
  one technology, society was necessarily resisting many ‘old’ and ‘new
  alternative technologies. In that sense, many, perhaps most, technolo-
  gies fail. However, some new technologies were indeed often additions
  to existing, alternative technologies. The bomber did not do away with
  armies and navies; the digital computer did not spell the end of the
  analogue computer until the 1960s.
   Historians who have focused on the issue of technological choice
  point again and again to the availability of competing technologies.
  For example, in the USA in the early years of the twentieth century,
  the petrol-powered car was, briefly, less common than either the steam
  or electric-powered car; indeed in Chicago the electric car dominated.
  In later years electric cars found niche markets: they accounted for
  around 20 per cent of motor taxis in Berlin between 1907 and 1918.”
  Before the Great War German fire departments had a strong tendency
  to choose electric fire engines to replace horses. In mid-century, with
  the growth of industrial electric [vehicles, ] [came ] [the ] [unique ] [British ]
  milk float, delivering milk to nearly every household in the land. Yet,
  while representing a plausible alternative, the electric vehicle generally

```
     lost out to the petrol-powered car. Among the many reasons for this
    was the problem of use outside the range of electrical networks, and
    the particular problems encountered with battery maintenance." In
     the world of cars there have been different kinds of internal combus-
     tion engine — diesel, petrol and two-stroke; different kinds of body
    material, including the use of a great deal of wood as late as the 1940s
     in the USA, and synthetic materials too. A nice example, developed
    and kept in production for many years in the particular conditions
    faced in the German Democratic Republic was the Trabant — a car
    with a resin/wool body and a two-cylinder two-stroke engine. There
    have been many types of competing road material in the twentieth
    century, for example, including tarmacadam and cement."
      In aviation too there have been many different types of engine
    and of aeroplane. There were petrol engines and diesel engines and
    the Soviet Union devoted huge effort to the steam aero-engine in
    the 1930s.'° Petrol engines came in many varieties: rotary, radial and
     inline. Jet engines would develop into turbo-prop, turbo-jet and
    turbo-fan variants. The transition from wood to metal in aircraft
    construction in the interwar years provides an interesting case of
    how choices were made. Moving to metal was often taken as an index
    of technical progress — metal was obviously better, and the quicker
    designers switched to metal the more advanced they were made to
    appear. Conversely, late use of wood was seen as the result of some
     eccentricity. But the assumption that wood was inferior to metal does
    not hold. What drove the shift from wood to metal was the belief
     that metal was the material of the future and thus inherently more
     suitable for aircraft, an ideology later subscribed to by historians of
     aviation. Nevertheless successful wooden aircraft, notably the British
    Mosquito of the Second World War, continued to be made.'” Note
     too that electric cars are making a comeback, and indeed that aircraft
     structures are now being made of ‘composites, similar in principle to
     the plywood-glue composites used in aircraft in the interwar years.
     One other way in which alternatives remain visible once we look for
    them is in what might be called reserve technologies, to be used if the

  technology of choice breaks down. They are much less common now
  in rich countries than in the past because of the increasing reliability
  of systems. However, even in rich and stable countries houses with
  electric light would have had paraffin lamps, and indeed candles, in
  reserve, and a Primus stove for cooking, in addition to an electric or
  gas range. Ships had hand-powered reserve steering gear, in case the
  main gear failed; they carried lifeboats with sails and oars. Cars will
  carry spare tyres, often more primitive than the usual tyres. Typically,
  but not necessarily, these reserve technologies are older, simpler tech-
  nologies. This reversion in time of crisis to an earlier, more robust
  and perhaps lower stage is an interesting reflection perhaps of an
  evolutionary pattern of thinking about technology. In many societies
  older technologies, or rather what are seen as old technologies, have a
  particular place in ceremonial occasions — from the use of candles at
  dinner, to the parading of troops in nineteenth-century uniforms and
  sometimes weapons, and the use of horse-drawn hearses in funerals.
   Sometimes circumstances forced the use of a reserve technology. For
  British men around 1960, the preferred method of committing suicide
  was poisoning using domestic gas, which contained carbon monoxide.
  From the early 1970s this was no longer possible as methane replaced
  coal-gas. Partly as a result, use of car-exhaust fumes grew increasingly
  popular, and in 1990 this briefly became the most common method.
  The rate then fell sharply, partly because of the spread of catalytic
  converters, which made exhaust fumes far less lethal. Hanging and
  strangulation became more commonly used — and by the end of the
  century were easily the most important methods. This was not by
  necessity: women preferred solid and liquid poisons."
  Assessing aviation and nuclear energy
  Private and public bodies have long wanted to assess projects, often in
  advance of undertaking them. Thus the US Army Corps of Engineers,
  responsible for water works in America, were instrumental in devel-.
  oping cost-benefit analysis to justify their projects in the early part
  of the last century.'? The clinical trial has long been important to

    doctors and to medical systems, but so have cruder assessments. One
    interwar doctor claimed that Britain could save 1.67 per cent of its
    annual national income if instead of treating the common complaint
     of leg ulcers with bed-rest, a new product, an elasticated plaster (Elas-
     toplast), was used. It is not known whether this saving was realised,
    but if it was this was surely one of the most important British tech-
    nologies of the century.”
     Twentieth-century warfare provides some important cases of the
    assessment of significance of technologies. In waging war against
     societies, assessments were made of the significance of particular
    systems, raw material supplies, industries and so on. What would most
     effectively incapacitate an enemy, the destruction of its transport, its
    energy supply, its industry in general or particular industries? What
    means should be selected to achieve such destruction? Two central
     cases of such assessments involved the most celebrated and suppos-
    edly world-transforming technologies of the century — aviation and
    nuclear power.
      Before the Second World War airmen believed that the new war
    from the air would be devastating and decisive. The strategic bombing
    of continental Europe by the RAF and the US Army Air Force, and
     that of Japan by the USAAK, was the result of such beliefs. A central
    argument was that modern societies would collapse under the impact
    of even mild bombing (an argument later transferred to rockets and
     nuclear weapons). During the war it became clear to some that air
    power was not necessarily devastating or decisive, leading to acrimo-
    nious disputes over the whole bombing effort and/or which targets
    should be attacked. Sometimes the discussions highlighted the strategic
    significance of particular industries. Thus there were arguments
     for attacking ball-bearing production, highly concentrated in a few
     plants, and manufacturing a product without which motor vehicles
    could not work; or attacking synthetic oil plants, because without fuel
    Germany could not fight; or electricity plants and so on. On the eve
    of the Normandy landings there was a particular debate about how
     best to help the advancing armies. What should be attacked? German

 industry as a whole, the oil industry or transportation? If the latter,
 how should it be attacked? Should one attack road and rail bridges
 or marshalling yards and repair depots? The former were difficult to
 destroy, but remained so, the latter were easily hit, but were quickly
 repairable.*! The commander of the British bomber forces between
 1942 and 1945, Sir Arthur ‘Butcher’ Harris, dismissed precision attacks
 on particular plants and industries as ‘panaceas’; he argued that the
 only effective targets were whole cities.
  There was a broader question: how significant was the bomber? In
 1945 Sir Arthur Harris claimed that ‘the heavy bomber did more than
 any other single weapon to win this War’, adding that, while the key
 technologies of a future war would change, the ‘quickest way of winning

     the War will still be to devastate the enemy’s industry and thus destroy
     his war potential.” In his final despatch the British commander used a
     series of tables and graphs of tonnage of bombs dropped to make his
     case. He showed that nearly 1 million tons of bombs were dropped by
     the RAF, some 45 per cent on ‘industrial towns. The index of success
     was the ‘total acreage of devastation’ in the target built-up areas of
     Germany; by the end of the war 48 per cent of them were ‘devastated’
     or ‘destroyed’ by RAF bombs alone. Harris produced practically no
     graphical information or data on the effects of bombing on industrial
     production, or on the effects of attacking synthetic oil or transporta-
     tion, both of which he had been against. Nor did he consider alterna-
     tive strategies, except in two cases. He claimed that between April and
     September 1944, when Bomber Command was, in his view, distracted
     from ‘its proper strategic role’, that is diverted to attacking transpor-
     tation and the German army around D-Day, Germany was able to
     reorganise war production and increase the supply of armament,
     particularly of new weapons.” Secondly, he claimed that, without
    bombing, Germany could have used the 2 million workers in anti-
     aircraft forces and engaged in repairing bomb damage to make arms
     instead. Relying on the evidence of the captured German armament
     minister Albert Speer, he claimed Germany could have increased pro-
     duction of anti-tank and field guns by around 30 per cent.” In his
     interrogation Speer claimed that in 1944 30 per cent of output of guns
     was for anti-aircraft use, as were 20 per cent of heavy shells, 50-55 per
     cent of the ‘electrotechnical industry and 30 per cent of the optical
     industry.”
      However, Harris’s claims were to be subject to devastating attack as
      a result of one of the greatest ever retrospective technology assessment
     exercises. As the land armies moved in to the bombed areas, they were
     joined by investigators from the US Strategic Bombing Survey. The
     survey was led by the head of the Prudential Insurance Company: the
     monstrous effort involved 350 officers, 300 civilians and 500 enlisted
     men.”° The USSBS came out against the RAF and its predominant
     practice of area bombing, but particular reports supported the attacks

  on transportation and synthetic oil. They claimed that the bombing of
  cities had a negligible impact on production, whereas the crippling of
  transport and synthetic oil production had effects felt right across the
  German war machine.’’ Everywhere was evidence which contradicted
  important claims. For example, in 1944 only some 13 per cent of
  Germany’s heavy guns (over 75mm) were anti-aircraft guns. Further-
  more, compared with 1943, the proportion of anti-aircraft guns was
  falling, contrary to the confident assertions of the bomber and the
  bombed.*®
   The assessment made by the USSBS of the bombing effort against
  Japan was specially striking. The bombing of the Japanese home
  islands was much less heavy than that of Germany: 160,000 tons of
  bombs were dropped rather than the 1,360,000 tons which fell within
  Germany’s borders.” Yet, the damage was similar because the bombs
  were more concentrated in time and more accurately delivered.
  Some 40 per cent of the built-up area of the sixty-six cities attacked
  was destroyed. And yet, the effects on the economy were not clear
  cut because of the repercussions of another form of attack on Japan
  — blockade. ‘Japan’s economy was in large measure being destroyed
  twice over, once by cutting off of imports, and secondly by air attack’,
  reported the USSBS. Even without any bombing, war production
  would have been halved by 1945.°°
   The USSBS also made a devastating comparison between the two
  instances of atomic bombing and conventional bombing, as it came
  to be known later. They estimated that the Hiroshima bomb did the
  same damage as ‘220 B-29s carrying 1,200 tons of incendiary bombs,
  400 tons of high-explosive bombs, and 500 tons of anti-personnel
  fragmentation bombs’ while the Nagasaki bomb was the equivalent
  of ‘125 B-29s carrying 1,200 tons of bombs.*' In another measure
  they concluded that the atomic bomb ‘raises the destructive power
  of a single bomber by a factor of somewhere between 50 and 250
  times’? That gives an effective TNT equivalence of an atomic bomb.

     the huge explosive power of an atomic bomb was not directed at the
     target. What the report was suggesting was that an atomic raid did the
    same sort of damage as a standard large conventional one, a few per
     cent at most of the destruction meted out to Japan from the air. The
    designers of the bomb would not have been surprised. In May 1945 a
    key committee meeting at Los Alamos was told that ‘one atomic bomb
    on an arsenal would not be much different from the effect caused
    by any Air Corps strike of present dimensions.*’ This knowledge was
     critical in target selection, since potential atomic targets had to be
     ‘likely to be unattacked by next August’; the meeting was told of a
     ‘list of five targets which the Air Forces would be willing to reserve for
     our use unless unforeseen circumstances arise [emphasis added]’. Four
    were selected — Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama and Kokura Arsenal —
    and ‘reservations for these targets’ were requested.** Atomic bombs
    showed their destructive capabilities only because alternatives were
    kept out of play. We should not, however, underestimate the point that
    they were weapons of mass terror as well as mass destruction.
     The atomic bombs were the product of an industrial effort which
     cost just under $2bn ($20bn in 1996 dollars). One billion dollars to
    destroy a city which would have been destroyed at minimal additional
     cost by one conventional raid represented an awful lot of ‘bucks per
    bang. Another way to look at it is that it cost $3bn to manufacture the
    4,000 or so B-29s which were used exclusively in long-range opera-
     tions against Japan, including as atomic bombers. This figure included
     their spare parts, but excluded maintenance, fuel, weapon and staffing
     costs, as well as the cost of building and running airfields.** Another
    index was that the total cost of the atomic bombs was the equivalent of
    making one-third more tanks or five times more heavy guns.” It is not
     difficult to imagine what thousands more B-29s, one-third more tanks
     or five times more artillery, or some other military output, would have
    done to Allied fighting power. Might it not have shortened the war
    considerably? In other words, by reducing the conventional material
     available, the atomic programme, it could be argued, lengthened the
    war and this cost lives. That we do not see this is partly the result of

  a carefully fabricated myth put about after the war, that the bomb
  brought the war to a quick end and saved no fewer than 1 million US
  lives.” This myth depended on the dubious counterfactual argument
  that the Japanese would have fought on and on had they not suffered
  atomic bombing, and that the only other way of defeating them
  involved an invasion that would cost 1 million lives. In other words,
  this argument assumed that blockade and conventional bombing
  were ineffective by comparison with the atomic bomb. Yet Japan was
  very close to surrender before the bombs were dropped. The crucial
  factors which led to surrender were the entry of the Soviet Union into
  the war against them, and the change in the terms of surrender being
  offered, a change which came after the atomic bombs were dropped.
  The bombs may have made surrender easier, but not more likely. They
  did not end either the war, or war in general.
   The German V-2 project, another huge wartime undertaking, was
  also economically and militarily irrational, and this too was obvious
  to some at the time. British scientific intelligence suggested the
  Germans were building a rocket of around 10 tons, with a warhead of
  around 1 ton. This estimate, which proved correct, was controversial
  because it was not cost-effective to build missiles that could fly 200
  miles and deliver one ton of explosive once, when you could build
  aeroplanes which could deliver ten times that, again and again, over
  greater ranges. And yet, that is exactly what the Germans did.** In
  October 1942 the V-2 was successfully tested. Two years later, the first
  V-2 was fired in anger, and around twenty were being built a day. The
  V-2 ‘was a unique weapon, says its historian, Michael Neufeld, in that
  ‘more people died producing it than died from being hit by it’: at
  least 10,000 slave labourers perished in the course of production and
  around 5,000 from it.*? Nearly 6,000 V-2s were made so that, very
  crudely, it took two human lives to make a V-2 and each killed one
  person. It is estimated that instead of V-2s Germany could have built
  24,000 fighter aircraft.
   The total cost of development and production of the V-2 was
  around $500m, about a quarter [of ][the ] [US ] [atomic ] [bomb ] [project. ] [Yet ]

```

```
     the destructive power of all the V-2s produced amounted to less
     than could be achieved by a single raid on a city by the RAF or the
     USAAE. The ‘United Nations’, as twenty-six and then more, anti-Axis
     Allies were known from 1942, should have been grateful to Werner
     von Braun, Albert Speer and Adolf Hitler for supporting a technol-
     ogy this draining to their own war effort. However, the Axis should
     have been even more grateful to General Groves and the atomic sci-
     entists for coming up with the most expensive explosive ever created.
     There is a terrible symmetry here since the US produced only four
     atomic bombs during the war, each of the destructive capacity of a
     conventional raid — in other words, the bang per buck was identical
      at $500m per destroyed city. Of course, had the war continued longer,
     the economics would have made a little more sense, as the capital
     cost had been spent. Nevertheless the costs per bomb or rocket were
      still huge. Had the war extirpated militarism from the world and had
     the development of weapons stopped, the rocket and the A-bomb
     would not have been seen as harbingers of the future, but more likely
      as the last dreadful examples of the irrationality of war and military
     technology.
      Within the context of the unprecedented peacetime militarism
     which followed the Second World War, both the rocket and bomb
     were later to make a certain sort of sense. For the combination of the
     rocket and the hydrogen bomb, which was in a quite different class of
     destructive power from the A-Bomb, was to make sense in bang-per-
     buck terms, simply because destructive power increased so much. To
     that extent the atomic bomb and V-2 cases illustrate the short-sight-
     edness of focusing only on the early stages of a technology (though
     both were put into production on a huge scale in wartime). We have,
     in other words, an example of the distinction to be made between
     what is efficient at a given time and what may be more efficient over
     time, what economists call static and dynamic efficiency.
      Yet the post-war US atomic programme, including bombers and
     missiles, although capable of immense destruction, was not cheap:
     nearly $6,ooobn (in 1996 prices) were spent between 1940 and 1996.

  That was about one-third of all defence expenditure and just under
  the total spent on social security by the United States.*° So powerful
  was this arsenal that it could not be used, so at this point we have to
  throw away our use criterion of significance. Its utility, to the extent
  it had any, was in preventing certain actions by others. Yet, for the
  Chinese Communists, famously, atomic weapons were ‘paper tigers’,
  although they too built them.
  Spin-off
  One of the most common responses to claims that a particular
  technology has not had the powerful positive effect it was claimed to
  have has been to suggest that there have been significant secondary
  effects not captured by the direct assessment. Thus one response to the
  claim that railways were not that important to economic development
  was to point to the stimulating effect they had on other industries
  such as engineering, iron and steel, and telegraphy. The term ‘spin-off’
  is used to describe this effect. The significance of spin-off has not been
  properly assessed, for it was a propagandistic argument which few in
  the know took seriously. One important feature of spin-off arguments
  is that they tend to be associated, with no convincing evidence, with
  technologies which are already for other reasons regarded as funda-
  mental. Aviation, rockets and nuclear power were all key cases.
   One of the most famous examples, even if regarded with some
  derision, was that the US space programme spun-off Teflon, a new
  plastic which found an important use in coating frying pans to make
  them non-stick. Such arguments were important since there was no
  economic utility in civil space missions until quite recently. Of course,
  the civil space programme had other purposes, such as providing
  entertainment, propaganda and a welcome distraction from more
  pressing and tedious problems, but these were not aims the promoters
 would have emphasised. Teflon was hardly enough of a justification
  for its enormous cost.
   Interestingly the origin of Teflon, or PTFE, had nothing to do with
  the space programme. It had been [known ] [and ][used ] [for ][decades ] [before ]

  signal processing, smoke detectors, bicycle helmets, baby formula and
  much more besides.
   Remarkable as it might seem, some spin-offs have themselves had
  negative effects on the wealth of nations. In 1956 the British started
  generating electricity using power from a nuclear reactor the main
  aim of which was producing plutonium for atomic bombs. This was
  misleadingly hailed as the first commercial nuclear reactor in the
  world.* Britain already had the most ambitious civil nuclear power
  plans in the world, and would generate more nuclear power than any
  other country for the next decade. The first British programme was
  based on the Magnox reactors. Some are still in operation today, with
  the last due to close in 2010, giving these machines lives of around
  forty years. As early as 1965 a decision had to be taken on the next gen-
  eration of reactors, and the advanced gas-cooled reactor was chosen.
  Construction started in the 1960s; the first was completed in 1976, the
  last in 1989. They all still operate, and the last will be decommissioned
  in 2023. The AGR programme was enormously expensive and led toa
  net loss to Britain, compared with the costs of using other nuclear, and
  indeed non-nuclear, technologies. Compared to a hypothetical pres-
  surised water reactor (PWR) programme the total loss was predicted
  to be around £2bn in 1975 prices.** When the electricity industry was
  privatised, the Magnox reactors could not be sold; the AGRs were
  effectively given away free.
   A second great project of the 1960s derived from military precedents,
  the Anglo-French supersonic airliner Concorde, was also, according to
  cost-benefit analysis, a dreadful waste of money. The prototype flew in
  1969, and commercial, if that is the right term, flights started in 1976.
  Would there be any returns? The airlines said that they could not fly
  Concorde profitably even if it was given to them for nothing, as effec-
  tively happened in the cases of British Airways and Air France, who
  operated them for around thirty years. Worthwhile spin-offs from the .
  Concorde project or the civil nuclear programme are hard to find.
    It is significant that these are big, controversial technologies,

     funded, organised and deployed by states. One result is that many
     associate the state with horrendously bad technological judgement,
     while civil society, and markets in particular, it is assumed, will make
     better decisions. In civil society the question of significance is left
     to anonymous and multiple calculators. Yet large corporations have
     great powers of decision and it does not follow that lots of competing
    decision-makers will give better results. For they make their judge-
    ments on the basis of givens which they might not themselves control.
    The outcome of many such small decisions can add up to an overall
     negative outcome by comparison with the alternatives. The effect
     is much harder to calculate, and there is less incentive to do so. Yet
     it is often claimed, for example, that the motorisation of the world
    through mass car ownership is not the optimal use of resources. Public
     transport could, it is argued, yield a better outcome.
    Small technologies and big effects
     At first blush contraception is associated, at least when we think
     of technologies of contraception, with the oral contraceptive Pill.
    The Pill is regarded as important not just because it is a powerful
     contraceptive, but because it is often held to have initiated a sexual
     revolution. In the rich countries of the world that sexual revolution
     was real enough, so the claim that it was brought about by the use
     of synthetic steroidal hormones is a striking case of how something
     small and mundane can trigger extraordinary change. What exactly
     the Pill did is far from clear. When the Pill is linked directly with the
     sexual revolution, one can easily detect the assumption that either
     there were no alternatives to the Pill as a contraceptive or that the
     alternatives were much inferior. The history of these alternatives is,
    by comparison, hardly known. While the Pill is the subject of a vast
     literature, the condom and the many other mundane birth-control
     technologies are rarely made central to the history of contraception.*
     Yet contraception provides a wonderful example of the long existence
     of many alternative means, the significance of declining and disap-
     pearing technologies, and of re-emerging ‘old’ technologies.

```

    Fertility control, birth control and contraception have all been
  practised by different means for a long time. In the twentieth century
  there were several birth-control techniques from abortion to sterilisa-
  tion, withdrawal, many forms of rubber contraceptives and chemical
  ones too. Several of them were, for much of the century, illegal in
  many parts of the world, and nearly everywhere were hidden from
  public view. Knowing what went on, having any indication of the use
  of the various methods, is extremely difficult.
   One of the most important forms of contraception appears to
  have been the condom. The condom was associated with the barber
  shop and the barracks, and the prevention of disease, and was for
  many decades the product of a semi-underground industry. From
  the 1930s condoms could be mass produced by dipping glass moulds
  into latex solution. They could be turned out by the billion, and made
  cheaply and thinly enough to be disposable. US condom production
  was 1.4 million daily in 1931 and increased rapidly, so that in post-
  war America they were widely used. After the Second World War,
  helped doubtless by the issuing of condoms to troops, contraceptive
  condom usage went up strongly. For example, annual British sales
  increased steadily from around 43 million in 1949, to 150 million in
  the late i960s.*° Clearly condoms were not used in the majority of
  sexual encounters.
   Condoms were, however, just one of many contraceptive technolo-
  gies. Alongside them there were all sorts of feminine contraceptive
  technologies available from a semi-underground market — products
  such as abortificients, spermicides, douches and more besides,
  including sterilisation. In the USA in the 1930s sales of such technolo-
  gies were about the same as those of condoms. The famous birth-
  control campaigners operating in interwar Britain and the USA, Marie
  Stopes and Margaret Sanger, promoted a particular kind of feminine
  rubber technology, the diaphragm and the cap. They were under the
  control of women, and were respectable in ways in which condoms .
  were not; they also required medical intervention. The aim of these
  campaigners was to medicalise and feminise contraception. Margaret

     Sanger went on to be a key figure in promoting the research that led
     to the contraceptive Pill, which would be manufactured by the phar-
     maceutical industry and prescribed by doctors. It was available in the
    USA from the late 1950s, and licensed for contraceptive purposes in
      1960.
      The Pill had enormous success. It did not just add to contraception
     technology but led to the decline of other barely visible contracep-
     tive technologies. In the USA condom sales were falling rapidly in the
     early 1960s, and by the late 1960s the Pill was a more common form of
     contraception than the condom. In Britain condom use fell from the
     early 1970s. The Pill was more effective than previous contraceptives,
     did not involve the intercession of vulcanised rubber in the mingling
     of body fluids, and crucially its use was separated in time from sex, all
     vital qualities which did not affect its contraceptive power, but had a
     huge impact on its desirability. Also important was the fact that the
      Pill was the only contraceptive technology that could be, and was,
     talked about in public.
      The Pill made contraception public and respectable in ways
     unimaginable before it burst on to the scene, and therein lay at least
     part of its power to help transform sexual relations. The link between
      Pill availability and sexual behaviour is the subject of debate: there
     is no clear-cut conclusion to be drawn about its relationship to the
     sexual revolution; the main novelty was sex between people who did
     not intend to marry each other, rather than pre-marital sex per se.
      Its relationship to the use of other techniques in relation to sexual
     behaviour is unexplored.” It is implausible, however, to suggest that
     the contraceptive Pill was the only available technical means which
     could have brought about the sexual revolution.
      Suggestive is the fact that in the post-sexual revolution era pre-
      Pill contraceptives did not disappear. After the Pill, there was more
     research than ever in contraception, leading to the development of
    competing technologies, including the IUD.** The condom is an
     example of a growing, disappearing and reappearing technology. Sales
     increased rapidly from the 1980s in the wake of AIDS, a phenomenon

   which made the condom, for the first time, as mentionable as the Pill.
  World condom production capacity increased from 4.9 billion in 1981
   to 12 billion per annum in the mid-1990s. There was, as one might
   expect, technological innovation in condoms, with the first anatomi-
   cally shaped one produced in 1969, the spermicide-lubricated in 1974,
   and more since. In 2004 the Durex brand celebrated seventy-five years
   of history with the slogan ‘75 years of great sex’.
  Malaria
   The control of malaria, like birth control, has been done in many
   different ways. As in the case of the Pill, the significance of any par-
   ticular method needs to be looked at in relation to other methods,
   not a hypothetical world where malaria was uncontrollable. The re-
  emergence of diseases thought to have been mastered, like malaria,
   or cholera or TB, has led to renewed use of old techniques of dealing
   with them, as well as new ways.” Malaria was, and is, one of the
   most serious diseases on a world scale. It was not, as it now is,
   confined to tropical regions, but endemic in many temperate areas
   (for example southern Italy) in the first half of the twentieth century.
   Malaria was treatable, and it could be controlled with prophylac-
   tic doses of treatments, or by eliminating the mosquitoes which
   carried it. The standard treatment used a natural product, quinine,
  which the Dutch empire came to control through ownership of
   plantations in their colony of Java. Synthetic alternatives began to be
   explored, particularly in Germany. In the 1930s Atebrin (mepacrine)
   was developed, but because it made the skin go yellow was not much
   used. However, the loss of the Dutch East Indies to the Japanese in
   the Second World War forced the Allies to use it, as a prophylac-
   tic and treatment. There was a large programme of anti-malarial
  research during the war which led to three drugs which would be
  widely used post-war in treatment and as prophylactics: chloroquine
   (already made and dismissed by the Germans in the 1930s), amo-.
  diaquine and proguanil (paludrine). In Syria and in former French
  colonies in Africa, chloroquine was used in mass prophylaxis in

     the 1970s in an attempt to eradicate the disease, but the result was
    increased levels of resistance.”
      But drugs are just part of the story. Insecticides and the elimination
    of insect-breeding grounds by controlling water flows and ensuring
    good drainage had proved to be effective too. Indeed just such multiple
    measures had already succeeded in eliminating malaria from many
    parts of the world. But malaria control is particularly associated with
    DDT. DDT was developed by Ciba-Geigy in Switzerland but taken up
    on a huge scale by the Americans, not just to deal with malaria, but
     also with the lice that transmit typhus, notably during the Second
    World War. Its inventor, Dr Paul Miiller, was awarded the Nobel prize
     for medicine and physiology in 1948. The British developed another
    powerful new insecticide, Gammexane, though this was less used. In
     1944 it was announced that in the Pacific General MacArthur had
    won ‘one of the greatest victories ... a victory by Science and dis-
     cipline over the anopheles mosquito’, not surprisingly, since before
     this malaria had accounted for about ten times as many casualties
     in soldiers as combat.*! After the war DDT was widely used to try to
    eradicate malarial mosquitoes. What DDT offered was not malaria-
    eradication, but a cheap, quick means of killing mosquitoes, which
    did not require such detailed and prolonged intervention: it was a
    low-maintenance option.”
     But precisely that lack of depth of intervention was probably
     critical in allowing malaria to survive, and indeed later to expand,
     as systems of surveillance were weak and further weakened. The late
     1950s saw the start of a global programme to eradicate malaria from
    the areas in which it was still found, excepting sub-Saharan Africa.
    The programme was based on a ‘spraygun war’ with DDT, but, though
     initially successful, it lost momentum in the late 1960s. In India in 1951
     there were 75 million cases, and 800,000 people died of the disease.
    DDT spraying starting in 1953 and the army of spraymen brought
    malaria cases down to 50,000 in 1961. But new outbreaks were not
    policed or dealt with, leading to an increase later. By 1965 cases had
    doubled to 100,000, rising right through the 1960s and early 1970s, to

```

```
  reach perhaps 50 million in the late 1970s. As a result ‘WHO began to
  resurrect older tactics that had been superseded by miracle pesticides
   ... the whole rusty arsenal reappeared.’* The production of old drugs
  had to be stepped up and new variations brought in, with renewed
  attention given to netting.
    In the world as a whole, the motor vehicle is just behind malaria in
  the list of killers, a sobering measure of the significance of a technol-
  ogy. Three times as many people (nearly 200,000 out of a world total
  of around 1 million a year) die in Africa from car accidents as in the
  whole of Europe. In Africa the death rate per car on the road is up to
  forty times greater than in the rich countries. Even though there are
  many fewer cars in Africa than Europe, they kill nearly three times
   as many people, corrected for population, than in the rich countries
  of Europe. In Kenya, road accidents are the third cause of death after
  malaria and HIV/AIDS. But this linking of malaria and the motor car
   tells us that our sense of technological time needs adjusting, and it
   is to that topic that we now turn. For malaria has been increasing in
   Africa, not because Africa is reverting in time, but because it has been
   entering a new future, one not envisaged in the old models.

              Time
    An Imperial Airways aeroplane flies over a camel caravan in the 1920s;
     a donkey cart carries the remains of a motor car through Bombay.
    This juxtaposition of what is taken to be old and new has long been
     a common photographic genre. The first represented technologi-
     cal optimism, the second a much more ambivalent attitude. These
    seeming clashes of technological time arise from a particular under-
    standing of old and new. We see technologies such as the camel, the
    donkey cart, the wooden plough or the hand-loom as technologies of
    previous historical eras. Yet they, just like the aeroplane and the motor
     car, were made, maintained and used throughout the last century;
    they existed in the same, interconnected world. What better example
     of this is there than that shown in some startling photographs which
    appeared at the end of the twentieth century: poor Indians and Ban-
     gladeshis were dismantling giant ocean-going ships, not in some state-
     of-the-art dry-dock, but with minimal equipment on the beaches of
     the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
     While donkey carts and hand-looms belong in folkloric museums,
    aeroplanes and motor cars belong in science and technology museums.
    Very occasionally they are combined. The Science Museum in Bangkok,
    which opened in 2000, brought together the usual displays of science
    and technology with those more characteristic of a folk museum: it
    had a section on ‘traditional technology, including carving, pottery,
    metallurgy, wickerwork and textiles. These were not technologies

  to be left behind, but were displayed to help preserve and revive
  traditional handicraft skills. In the rich world, science museums and
  folk museums are usually separate, and each has a different sense of
  time. Science and technology museums want, and do, tell a story of
  novelties, firsts and of the future.
   The London Science Museum hasa showcase gallery, grandly entitled
  ‘The Making of the Modern World’ This has a timeline inscribed on its
  floor, but it is an innovation timeline. Thus steam power appears only
  in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century parts of the display. Yet, on
  entering the main hall of the museum the visitor had, until recently, to
  pass by a triple-expansion reciprocating marine steam engine. Most
  adult visitors confidently dated this machine to the mid nineteenth
  century, for it looked like something from ‘the industrial revolution’ Yet
  the labels told a different story: the engine was built in 1928 for a British
  fishing boat. Converted to a pleasure yacht the boat and engine were in
  use for decades, long enough indeed to become of historical interest:
  a museum piece, as the expression goes. In fact, the museum is full of
  twentieth-century steam engines; they are just not part of the story it
  sets out to tell its mostly young visitors. Such machines are more likely
  to be highlighted in folkloric industrial museums, or in those devoted
  to old forms of transport or warfare. ‘Useful things disappear more
  completely than meaningful and pleasurable things, noted a brilliant
  analyst, who recalled how we keep old paintings, jewels and suchlike,
  but not tools.' They disappear as soon as they no longer have practical
  use. Yet many things we think of as old remained in practical use for
  longer than our future-oriented accounts of technological history
  allow. Our industrial, scientific and technological museums testify to
  the long life of many machines, and yet, at the same time, many deny
  the significance of this point for our thinking about technology.
   Many of the most important technologies of the twentieth century
  were invented and innovated long before 1900. Some, but not all,
  declined during the twentieth century. [Their ] [importance ] [should ] [not ] _

     history of twentieth-century technology usefully starts with tech-

     anachronistically, like camel caravans and donkey carts, or better still
     horsepower.

   Times are changing
   Traditionally technological timelines date technology by invention or
   innovation. Timelines imply that time is a key variable, that it is the
   march of time which shapes history. That is the assumption behind
   graphing so much economic data against time. Yet things do not
   spread like a contagious disease, with a few people getting new tech-
   nologies early, followed by increasing numbers learning from those
   who have them, until the rate of adoption falls as most people have
   them. The international spread of ownership of things shows that the
   diffusion of things works differently — the rate of take-up has varied
   enormously between countries, irrespective of how long the technol-
   ogy took to arrive in the first place.
    New technologies appeared in every corner of the world very soon
   after innovation. Cars appeared in Barcelona by 1898. The famous
   firms of Hispano-Suiza and Elizalde were formed in the city in 1904
   and 1911, respectively. By 1912 the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia)
   had 1,194 automobiles.’ The Argentine city of Salta, in the foothills of
   the Andes, had more than 200 motor cars by 1915. The first aeroplane
   flight in Barcelona was in 1910, and the first locally produced aircraft
   to fly was built in 1916. The first plane to fly in Japan did so in 1910 and
   in 1914 Japanese forces used aircraft against German forces in China.
   Aeroplanes were used in war in North Africa and the Balkans, before
   the Great War. Colombia’s first airline started operations in 1919.

    The time it took for a new technology to reach a particular part of
   the world tells us little about the rate at which its use was to be taken
   up, and thus its impact, in different countries. This was not a matter of

    time but of money. Crudely speaking the uptake of new technologies
    was determined by income. In the United States there was a profusion
    of consumer goods such as cars and washing machines in the 1920s
    at levels which were some thirty years in advance of even the richest
    European countries. Europeans were poorer than Americans; once
    they became as rich as the Americans had been they bought them
    in similar quantities. And that process is repeating itself: as other
    countries become richer they too see more and more of their people
    buying these standard goods which have been around for a long time.
   Many countries have not reached the levels of income per head or
    motorisation or electrification that the United States achieved in the
    1920s. Although much of Africa first got television in the 1950s and
    1960s there were only around twenty-five TV sets per 1,000 popula-
    tion in the 1980s, well below the level of countries now richer who first
    got television at the same time or later.
     Yet while technological replication over time, driven by economic
    development, is a crucially important element in the history of the
    twentieth century, it can mislead us. The replication over time is far
    from exact. Thus at the end of the twentieth century places such as
    Colombia, Morocco, Mexico, Thailand, China and Brazil had roughly
    the same level of income per head as the richest countries of the world
    and the great imperial powers had in 1913. Clearly they had different
    technologies for transportation, communication, health care and so
    on. Part of the reason was that new technologies became available;
    technological time is a factor. But, equally, ‘old’ technologies came into
    use in ways which were not prefigured in the past. As poor countries
   became richer they expanded the use of technologies that form no
    part of the usual schemes of modernisation.
   Horses, mules and oxen
    The use of the horse for human purposes was invented thousands of
    years ago. The breeding, rearing, training and maintaining of horses
    was expert work that created beasts which did not exist in the wild. If
    we were to date the age of horsepower by its maximum use, it would

  be much more recent than one might think. Twentieth-century horse-
  power was not a left-over from a pre-mechanical era; the gigantic
  horse-drawn metropolis of 1900 was new. In Britain, the most indus-
  trialised nation in the world in 1900, the use of horses for transporta-
  tion peaked not in the early nineteenth century but in the early years
  of the twentieth. How could it be that horse transport expanded at
  the same time as trains pulled by ‘iron horses’? The answer is that
  economic development and urbanisation went hand in hand with
  more horse-buses, horse-trams and horse-carriages. In addition,
  while train and ship carried goods over long distances, over shorter
  distances horse-drawn vehicles became ever more necessary. Thus
  visitors to London’s Camden Market, on the site of a huge railway
  yard and interchange with the canal system, will note that many of
  the old buildings were stables.° These were not there to house animals
  used for riding in nearby Regent’s Park, but for draught animals. In
  1924 the largest and most progressive British railway company, the
  London, Midland and Scottish, had as many horses as it had locomo-
  tives — 10,000. By contrast it had just over 1,000 motor vehicles. In
  1930 the London and North Eastern Railway railway had 7,000 steam
  locomotives and 5,000 horses, and only about 800 motor vehicles.°
  There is no doubt though, that by 1914 in the great rich cities of the
  world, horse transport was giving way to the motor-powered buses,
   lorries and cars, and electric-powered trams.
    In agriculture, the horsepower peak was to come later. For example,
  in Finland the horse population peaked in the 1950s because they were
  used in logging. The United States provides the most graphic example.
  Agricultural horsepower peaked in 1915 with more than 21 million
  on American farms, up from 1 million in 1880, a level to which it
  had returned by the mid-1930s.’ The US case is particularly interest-

      7. The horse was vital to all belligerents in the Great War. Here horses destined for the
      war are taken from Paris. In the Second World War they were crucial to the German
      army, which marched into the Soviet Union with many more horses than Napoleon
              did in his invasion of the Russian Empire in 1812.
     horses’ upkeep: they were large consumers of grass, hay and grain.°
    Mechanised agriculture helped the US to become the richest large
    nation in the world, and one that by the 1910s was by far and away the
     largest producer of motor vehicles.
      In one area of twentieth-century life, the use of horses for transport
    was particularly remarkable. The Great War and the Second World
    War are seen as industrial wars, as feats of engineering and science and
    organisation. And so they were. Because of this both involved huge
    numbers of horses, which, like men, were conscripted. Every belliger-
     ent depended on them, as well as on mules and other beasts of burden.
    Before the Great War, the small British army had 25,000 horses but
    by the middle of 1917 the great new mass British armies had 591,000
     horses, 213,000 mules, 47,000 camels and 11,000 oxen. In late 1917 there
     were 368,000 British horses and 82,000 British mules on the Western

  Front alone, hugely outnumbering British motor vehicles. This was not
  a question of a deluded commitment to cavalry. Only one-third of the
  British horses on the Western Front were for riding (and only some of
  these were in cavalry units) — the great majority transported the vast
  quantities of materiel required in modern war, particularly from the
  railheads to the front. The use of the animals was not an exceptional
  emergency measure to make use of Britain’s existing horses. Horses
  were desperately needed, and Britain bought 429,000 of them and
  275,000 mules from the US, and imported vast quantities of fodder
  too. Britain’s ability to exploit world horse markets was crucial to its
  military power.’ In any case the British were not unique. The vast
  American armies pouring into Europe in 1918 equipped each of their
  very large infantry divisions with 2,000 draught horses, another 2,000
  riding horses and no fewer than 2,700 mules: one horse or mule for
  every four men.
   An even starker example of the continuing importance of the horse
  is provided by the Second World War. The German army, so often
  portrayed as centred on armoured formations, had even more horses
  in the Second World War than the British army had in the Great War.
  The horse was the ‘basic means of transport in the Germany Army’.
  German rearmament in the 1930s involved mass purchase of horses
  such that by 1939 the army had 590,000, leaving 3 million others in the
  rest of the country. Each infantry division needed around 5,000 horses
  to move itself. For the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, 625,000
  horses were assembled. As the war progressed the German horse army
  got ever larger as the Wehrmacht pillaged the agricultural horses of
  the nations it conquered. At the beginning of 1945 it had 1.2 million
  horses; the total loss of horses in the war is estimated at 1.5 million.!”
  Could it be that the Great War and the Second World War saw more
  horses in battle than any previous war? Could it be that the draught-
  horse-to-soldier ratio also increased, despite the use of other forms
  of transport? '! Certainly the Wehrmacht embarked on its march to
  Moscow with many times more horses than Napoleon’s Grand Armee.
  Indeed, it took longer to get there.

```
      There is no doubt that the global horse and mule population dropped
     from the early decades of the twentieth century. Horses disappeared
     from rich cities and from the fields of wealthy countries. Yet in some
     parts of the world not only did animal traction remain important,
     but it became more important as animals replaced human power. In
     one dramatic case, animal power replaced tractors. Cuban agriculture
     was transformed from the early 1960s with Soviet and East European
     agricultural machinery and supplies, resulting in a downgrading of
     animal traction. But the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989 led the
     Cuban government to develop an animal traction programme. The
     agricultural horse population recovered, but the main focus was on
     oxen. They were bred and trained in large numbers, and the technical
     infrastructure needed to use them was built up. The recovery in the
     number of oxen was spectacular. They had fallen from 500,000 in 1960
      to 163,000 in 1990 but increased to 380,000 in the late 1990s. They
     replaced 40,000 tractors.'”
    The decline of the ‘mule’ spinning machine
     The twentieth century has seen the decline in use of many indus-
     trial machines. A good example is the cotton-spinning machine that
     dominated the most important cotton industry existing in 1900 — the
     ‘mule’ spinning machine of the British cotton industry. The ‘mule’
     invented in the early nineteenth century, was so-called because it was
      a hybrid of two different types of spinning machines — it used the
     stretching motion of the spinning ‘jenny and the roller action of the
     ‘water-frame’ Each twentieth-century mule had around 1,500 spindles,
     and each pair of mules was operated by the male spinner and his two
     assistants, called the ‘big piecer’ and the ‘little piecer’.
      The spinning mule was at the centre of what was a globalised
     industry. Cotton was processed thousands of miles from where it
     was grown and was exported from a few industrial centres to the
     whole world. The hub of the industry was free-trading Britain, and
     particularly Cottonopolis itself, the city of Manchester. The peak
     year of the British cotton industry was 1913 when it was not only the

```

-----

```
   largest, but also the most efficient cotton industry in the world." In the
  interwar years, as trade de-globalised and Japan emerged as a major
  competitor, Manchester’s exports slumped. In 1931, the worst year of
   the depression, output was half what it had been in 1913. It was not
   to recover very much, and from the early 1950s a long steady decline
  continued, though this declining industry remained important. In the
   1930s it had around 30 per cent of world textiles exports, and 15 per
   cent in the early 1950s. Cotton goods accounted for 25 per cent of all
   British exports in the 1920s, and still made up 5 per cent in the early
   1950S.
   The machinery in use in the cotton-spinning industry into the
   late 1950s was overwhelmingly mule spinning machines, all of which
  were old. Around 80 per cent of the mules in use in 1930 had been
   installed before 1910. Hardly any mules were added after 1920, and
  none after 1930, so that by 1950 a great majority of the mules were
  well over forty years old, the estimated life of the machines in 1930. In
  other countries an alternative spinning technology, the ring-spindle
  spinning machines, had taken over but the peculiarly high proportion
  of mules in the British industry was not due to resistance to rings. It
  followed from the fact that after the early 1920s there was little invest-
  ment in new machines at all. So low was investment that at the rate
  of re-equipment obtaining in 1948 it would have taken fifty years to
  replace all the mules with new rings, and another fifty years to replace
  the old rings.'* In the mid-1950s too, investment was at a rate at which
   it would take decades to replace just the existing ring-spindles.'°
   The history of the industry after 1913 was thus one of a shrinking
  number of increasingly old machines. Many mules were lost simply
  because they became so old that they were not worth keeping, but
  many machines were taken out of use when still workable, because
  there was no market for their product. Some argued that these old
  machines took work from the new ones which might otherwise be
  installed. As a result the government went to the lengths of setting
  up something called the Spindles Board, which bought and scrapped
  spindles from those firms willing to sell. This is one example of a

```

-----

```
    worldwide phenomenon which shocked progressive opinion in the
     1930s — the destruction of machines when people needed work and the
    world needed clothing. Between 1936 and 1939 the Board scrapped 6.2
     million spindles, which compares with 15 million scrapped indepen-
     dently between 1930 and 1939. In the different economic circumstances
     after the war further scrapping schemes were promoted. The greatest
    came following the 1959 Cotton Industry Act, which led to the breaking
    up within a year of nearly 10 million mule spindles, which were by then
     fifty, sixty and seventy years old. Some lived on and found themselves
     in folklore museums, or in museums of science and technology.
     Our technological museums, with their emphasis on first design,
    tend to miss out on the extraordinary life stories of the objects they
    have. But the old stuff still in use now has its own nostalgic journals.
    There are many specialist publications on old trains, cars and ships
     still in operation. There are magazines such as Propliner, which deals
    with working old propeller-driven aircraft. That we are nostalgic for
    twentieth-century technologies, as well as nineteenth-century ones,
    points to the importance of the disappearance of things which rep-
    resented the future. The ironer, a machine to iron clothes, diffused
     to 10 per cent of Canadian households, but rather than being the
    beginning of a new wave of household automation, promptly dis-
    appeared, much as the British tea-making machines would.'* The
     airship, a technological wonder of the early decades of the century,
    went out of use quickly from the 1930s. The miracle insecticide DDT
    was to disappear faster than the mosquitoes and other insects it was
    used to kill. Concorde looks like being the first and the last supersonic
     airliner. Manned hypersonic aeroplanes disappeared in the 1960s. At
    the end of the twentieth century, nuclear power, once the technol-
    ogy of the future, was set to be phased out in many countries. And
    in medicine too, many treatments invented in the twentieth century
    were discontinued, lobotomy and ECT being prominent examples,
    though the last is still occasionally used.

  Not Alphaville but bidonville: technology and the poor
  megacity
  The story of the poor world (a term preferable to the euphemistic
  ‘developing world’, and the now irrelevant ‘Third World’) and tech-
  nology is usually told as one of transfer, resistance, incompetence, lack
  of maintenance and enforced dependence on rich-world technology.
  Imperialism, colonialism and dependence were the key concepts,
  and the transfer of technology from rich to poor, the main process.
  The crucial measures in play were the stock of rich-world technol-
  ogy in the poor world and its innovative capacity. There is a second
  line of thought, in which the poor world betrayed its true nature by
  adopting, even partially, ‘western’ technology.!” Dating to at least the
  interwar years, this view held that modern technology destroyed these
   local, ancient, alternative and more authentic cultures. More recently
  ‘western’ technology has been thought of as spearheading a violent
  assault on poor societies. Both accounts fail to take into consider-
  ation the distinctiveness of the new poor world as it emerged in the
  twentieth century. In particular, they fail to see the poor world as a
  distinctive technological world, one that was particularly fast-growing,
  and dependent on local and what are usefully called ‘creole’ technolo-
  gies, many of which we think of as ‘old’. That distinctive world can
  be voyeuristically consumed, as in the writings of the architect Rem
  Koolhaas and his associates, but it also needs to be understood not
   as the future, but as a distinctive world with its own technology of
  poverty.'®
   World population trebled in the twentieth century, but Europe’s
  population increased by only about 50 per cent. The significant growth
  has been in the poor world — Asia, Latin America and Africa. One of
  the greatest changes was in the cities of the poor world, which grew at
  extraordinary rates. By the end of the century (in stark contrast to the
  beginning) most of the largest cities of the world were poor places:
  where once Paris, London and New York led in scale and opulence,
  the largest cities of 2000 were places few would seek to emulate: Sao
  Paolo, Jakarta, Karachi, Mumbai (Bombay), Dhaka, Lagos and Mexico

     City. This was a new kind of urbanisation, and a spectacularly fast one,
    which did not replicate the earlier experience of Berlin or Manches-
     ter. These were not cities of horses, or of trains, or spinning mules,
     or great electrical or chemical industries. Furthermore, large parts of
    them were built without architects, engineers or building contrac-
     tors, and without conforming to building regulations. These parts of
     these cities were not made for cars or trains, let alone the information
    superhighway.
      Central to this new urbanisation was the growth of the slum, or
    shanty town, though we must be wary of these terms because they
     describe many different types of housing. For example, the favelas of
     Rio de Janeiro are connected to electricity and water, while the asenta-
    mientos (settlements) of Guatemala City are dark at night. At first
     sight, the term slum might refer, as it generally did in the rich world
    and in many parts of the poor world, to decayed old parts of cities
    where the poorest lived. But in the later twentieth century in particu-
     lar a new kind of slum, a newly built — one might say purpose-built
     — one, arose. The optimistic term pueblos jovenes, or young towns,
     used to describe the slums of Lima says something important about
    them even though many are decades old.
     We need to be particularly wary of definitions of slums in terms
     of the lack of facilities characteristic of rich cities, such as permanent
     structures, particular forms of sanitation or electricity. We need to ask
     not what technology the shanty town lacks, but what it has. For poor
     cities had particular and often novel systems of building, of sanitation,
     or supply of water, of food and all the other necessities of life, which
    were not traditional but new. They proved capable of sustaining a
    new kind of rapidly expanding urban existence on an enormous scale,
     even if usually a miserable one. One modern technology of the slum
    was the Kenyan ‘flying toilet. A plastic bag, that ubiquitous product
     of the post-Second World War chemical industry, was used not only
     to defecate into, but to dispose of what was once quaintly called ‘night
     soil’: the bag was tied, taken outside, swung around, and hurled away
     as far as possible from one’s patch."

    The modern materials from which many slums are built are
  sometimes inscribed in their very names. The early temporary slums
   of North Africa were known as bidonvilles, for the buildings were made
   from opened-up and flattened-out oil drums (bidons). The term is
  now generic in French. The Arabic term for bidonville in Morocco
   is mudun safi, ‘metal towns. The Durban slum dwellings are called
  imyondolos in Zulu, possibly derived from the use of wood from
   crates that had carried John Deere tractors in through the port in the
   1970s.”°
   One material stands out in the development of the poor world,
   rural and urban, and that is corrugated iron or galvanised iron used
   for making ‘tin roofs’ In the nineteenth century, it spread around the
  world to areas of British army operation as transportable housing. It
   also became a key material for building roofs and walls of white settler
   communities in Australia, New Zealand and the Americas, where it is
  now of interest as a vernacular architecture. It was hugely important
   in the twentieth century as a truly global technology. Its cheapness,
   lightness, ease of use and long life made it a ubiquitous material in the
   poor world in a way it never had been in the rich world. A visitor to
  West Africa in the Second World War noted of ‘Ibadan, then the largest
  town in black Africa ... [it] had grown in less than a century from a
   local market into a city with nearly 100,000 inhabitants — though alas,
   as so often in Africa, the houses were mostly roofed with galvanized
   iron.”! Today Ibadan is at one end of a shanty-town corridor of 70
   million people.” Its roofs, to judge from aerial photographs, are still
   of rusted corrugated iron.
    Corrugated iron was not just an urban technology; it was used to
   replace thatch roofs on traditional rural buildings as well. In Rwanda
  corrugated iron was first used by the Belgian colonisers for their public
   buildings. By the end of the twentieth century a lighter type was the
   standard roofing material of even the poorest homes. Farmers’ houses
   built of adobe had corrugated iron roofs, and were called terres-téles
   (earth-sheets). As the only part of the house villagers cannot make,
   the iron roof became a prized [possession; ] [it ][was ] [looted ] [from ] [Tutsis’ ]

    homes in the genocide of 1994. As the tables turned, Hutu refugees
    trudged to the Congo bearing sheets on their backs, others buried
    them in their fields.”
      As in other technologies, there has been innovation in corrugated
     iron, in both shapes and materials. It has become lighter and stronger,
    available in many more grades and types. New shapes of corrugations
    have been used, and new coating introduced. Yet the long-established
    sinusoidal corrugations still dominate the cheapest grades.
     A second crucial cheap material was asbestos-cement, especially
    corrugated asbestos-cement. Asbestos-cement was patented in 1901
    by an Austro-Hungarian, Ludwig Hatschek, an asbestos producer. He
    called his invention ‘Eternit, and the material and the name have
    both been long lasting. Production started by a Swiss company of
     the same name in 1903, which became a major multinational with
    branches all over the world. Eternit still means asbestos-cement in
    many places; in others it was called “Uralite’ or ‘Uralita. Although
     this is not always clear, by far the main use of asbestos — a fibrous
    mineral — has been for the manufacture of asbestos-cement (also
    known as fibro-cement), mainly used to produce corrugated roofing,
    sheets for building work, and water and sewage pipes. It has been a
    key material in modern urbanisation. At the beginning of the century
     it was primarily utilised in North America; after the Second World
    War its use boomed there, and particularly in Europe, but growth
    took off in Asia, South America and Africa in the 1960s and 1970s.”4
    Unfortunately asbestos was found to be a serious carcinogen, and its
     use was progressively banned in the US, Europe and elsewhere. As a
     result, world production fell from the mid-1970s. But at the end of
    the century production was still at the levels of the 1950s. Even in
     the 1990s in South Africa, 24 per cent of new subsidised housing had
    asbestos-cement roofing.”
     The Martinican/French writer Patrick Chamoiseau, in his book
     Texaco, the great novel of the shanty town, reflected a new under-
    standing of the poor city that was emerging in the 1960s and 1970s. In
    Texaco the history of Martinique is divided into the age of the ajoupas

  (shelters) and longhouses, the age of straw, the age of crate wood, the
  age of asbestos (fibro-cement) and the age of concrete, reflecting the
  key materials of the shanty towns.” In the age of asbestos, asbestos-
  cement sheet was used for walls; the roofs were of corrugated iron.
  Thereafter the people bought the occasional bag of cement to make
  their world more stable and secure. One of the characters in the book
  is a new model urbanist who began to understand this new kind of
  city. Indeed, ‘self-help housing’ and “auto construccién’ became terms
  of art in urban planning, recognising that houses were being built in
  vast numbers, well outside the standard networks of modernity.
   Corrugated iron, asbestos-cement and cement were not invented
  in the poor world, they were first exported to it, and then locally
  produced. The growth of the poor world went along with a massive
  increase in use of these ‘old’ technologies from the rich world, and
  yet also, importantly, it was a story of the spread of distinctive
  technologies often adapted from ‘old’ technologies. One can usefully
  describe them as ‘creole’ technologies. ‘Creole’ is a complex term
  with a long history and many variant meanings. It most commonly
  means local derivatives of something originally from elsewhere
  (typically the white and black populations of the Americas). The
  term also carries the sense of earthy, local, genuine, vulgar, popular,
  in contrast to the sophistication of the metropolitan. Creole means
  derived, but different from, the originating case. It sometimes carries
  the sense of hybrid between the incomer and the existing, though
  this is not the common form.”
  Creole technology
  One important aspect of creole technology is that the basic imported
  technology acquired a new lease of life in the poor world. There were
  many cases of late adoption and long use in the poor world of rich-
  country technologies. A small example would be that carrier pigeons
  were introduced to the police services in Orissa (India) in 1946 and
  were phased out only in the 1990s. The Indian motor-vehicle industry
  provides some better-known examples. [From ] [the ] [mid-1950s ] [the ] [1955- ]

    model Royal Enfield Bullet motorcycle was manufactured in India.
    Production of the same model continues to this day at the rate of
     10,000 a year in the original Madras factory, and with methods which
      still involve little assembly-line work. Hindustan Motors in Uttarpara,
     West Bengal, still make the Ambassador, based on a mid-1950s Morris
     Oxford Series II motor car. Production started in 1957 and to date
    800,000 have been produced. The history of the Volkswagen Beetle
     is a particularly notable case given the scale of its production. By
     the early 1970s it had overtaken the Model T Ford as the car most
    widely produced in the world (15 million), and it would continue to be
     manufactured, reaching a total of 21 million. The end of production
     came in Mexico in 2003, where it had been made since 1954. Brazilian
    production stopped in 1986, restarted in 1993 and finally came to an
    end in 1996, long after production finished in Germany.
     Communist China had its own distinctive attitude to old tech-
     nologies of production. It pursued a ‘walking on two legs’ policy of
     industrialisation that has been called ‘technological dualism. The first
     leg was large-scale, urban, factory production, using models brought
    from the Soviet Union. This was a huge effort of transfer of technical
     skills, models, designs and factories. China long remained a producer
     of Soviet technology: till the end of the 1980s it was making Soviet
     trucks and steam locomotives from the 1950s. Steam-train buffs
     flocked to the sidings and marshalling yards of China, for only in the
    mid-1980s did diesel and electric locomotive production overtake that
     of steam locomotives.
     The second leg was locally run, small-scale industry, reliant on local
     raw materials and supplying local needs, usually in the agricultural
     sector. These industries were based on centrally-supplied designs of
    technologies, usually themselves based on ‘old’ technologies that had
    gone out of use elsewhere in the world. From the late 1950s ‘backyard
     iron and steel’ production, together with small-scale cement kilns,
     fertiliser plants, agricultural machinery workshops, food-processing
    works, power generation and mining boomed under the Great Leap
    Forward. Fertiliser production was a rare example of a novel technol-

  ogy, for local plants made a fertiliser used nowhere else in the world
  — ammonium bicarbonate.
   The Chinese people paid an enormous price for what was by any
 measure the profoundly unsuccessful Great Leap Forward. Millions
  of lives were lost to famine, and there was also a cruel waste of tech-
  nological and natural resources in a desperately poor country. With
  the collapse of the Great Leap many local enterprises closed. But many
  did not, and survived till the next great expansion phase for these
  industries, the Cultural Revolution. By 1971 60 per cent of fertiliser
 production came from small plants; 50 per cent of cement; 16 per cent
  of hydro-generating capacity; overall around 10 per cent of Chinese
 factory output.”®
 Transport
 The idea that the technologies of the poor world simply lag behind
 those of the rich world in time is not generally applicable, as the case
  of the fabric of the poor megacity illustrates. Transport provides a
 second example, since the poor megacities had different transport
  patterns from those of the great rich cities of 1900, or even of 1930.
 These rich cities did not have the bicycle or motorcycle densities of
 the megacities of late twentieth-century Asia. Indeed bicycle and
 motor-bicycle production boomed in the world, particularly in the
 poor world, from the 1970s. For the first time in many decades bicycle
 production surged ahead of motor-car production. In recent years
 around 100 million bicycles were produced every year and only about
 40 million cars. In 1950 there were around 10 million of each, and they
 remained about equal to 1970. The great change was the expansion in
 Chinese production to 40-50 million bicycles from a few million in
 the early 1970s.” In addition Taiwan and India between them were, at
 the end of the century, making more bicycles than were produced in
 the world in 1950. Bicycle-derived technologies of the poor megacity
 provide an instance of a creole technology.
   In 2003 it was reported that the city of Calcutta was still trying
 to get rid of the hand-pulled rickshaw, long gone from most of the

```

-----

```
      rest of Asia. These rickshaws were deemed old-fashioned even by the
     standards of hand-rickshaws: Calcutta’s had spoked wheels, but not
     ones derived from bicycle technology; they were made of wood and
     were rimmed with solid rubber rather than pneumatic tyres. Surely
     these were survivals from the distant past?
       In fact the hand-pulled rickshaw, far from being an ancient
     invention, was apparently devised in Japan in the 1870s, though
     similar things had been in use in Europe ona small scale. The rickshaw
     replaced the palanquin/sedan chair. Use boomed from the very late
     nineteenth century, first in Japan, where numbers peaked around 1900
     and quickly spread in Asia. In Singapore the total was highest in the
     early 1920s, while Calcutta saw hand-rickshaw growth in the 1920s
     and 1930s. In most places the hand-rickshaw went out of use after the
     Second World War, condemned as a barbarous machine humiliating
     the poor pullers.
      The cycle-rickshaw (sometime called a trishaw) was, as an invention,
     almost as old as the rickshaw; yet as a thing-in-use it peaked even more
     recently.*° Developed in the 1880s, it found hardly any use until around
      1929 in Singapore, where by 1935 cycle-rickshaws outnumbered hand-
     pulled rickshaws. They appeared in Calcutta around 1930, Dhaka about
      1938, and Jakarta around 1936. By1950 they were present in every country
     in south and east Asia. Japan had never had many. There were variations
     in design across countries but relatively little within countries. The
     most common was that with the passenger sitting behind the driver
     (India, Bangladesh, China, the Macao ‘triciclo’). But the version with
     the passengers forward of the driver was also common, for example the
     Indonesian ‘becak’, the Vietnamese ‘cyclo’ and the Malaysian ‘trishaw’.
     Others had the passenger to the side, as in the Philippines ‘sidecar’, the
     Burmese ‘sai kaa’ and the Singapore ‘trishaw.*!
      Far from disappearing after the Second World War, the cycle
     rickshaw continued to expand rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s. It was
     estimated in the late 1980s that there were 4 million in the world, and
     that the number was still increasing overall though in some countries
     there were decreases. Dhaka was the capital of the cycle-rickshaw with

```

```
  some 300,000 at the end of the twentieth century. A subsequent creole
  technology, unknown in the rich cities of the world, is the scooter-
  based taxi. From the 1950s these ‘auto-rickshaws’ appeared in India,
  and similar designs have spread all over Asia (for example, the Thai
  ‘tuk-tuk and the Bangladeshi ‘baby-taxi’).
   The cycle-rickshaw was an urban, not a rural, machine. It followed,
  rather than preceded, seemingly newer transport techniques.
  Rickshaws needed the metalled roads which were built for cars and
  buses and lorries. Yet in the great expanding cities of Asia they were
  seen as demeaning technologies of poverty and as technologies of
  the past that needed to be got rid of. The city governments of Asia,
  whether colonial or post-colonial, wanted to control them, restricting
  licences, and indeed in places banning them outright. Yet if govern-
  ments had success in getting rid of machines such as the spinning
  mule in the middle of the century, they failed miserably in the case of
  the rickshaw, for numbers, as we have seen, continued to rise. They
  have now appeared in places they had never been before, including
  central London, where they operate regularly from the Soho enter-
  tainment district.
  Remodelling the boat
  Water transport provides some good examples of creole technologies,
  particularly in the sense of hybrids. In Bangkok the great river which
  runs through that megacity is home toa remarkable breed of craft. Long,
  thin, wooden boats have been converted [to ] [a ][species ] [of ][powerboat ] [by ]
  the addition of a large car engine [mounted ] [on ] [gimbals ] [which ] [powers ]
  a propeller on the end of a long [shaft. ] [The ] [operator ] [controls ] [the ] [boat ]
  by moving the whole engine and [associated ] [propeller. ] [A ] [brilliant ]
  invention, these ‘long-tailed [boats’ ] [first ][appeared ] [in ][Bangkok, ][but ][have ]

         8. Collecting hay in the Carpathian foothills in the Ukraine on the eve of the
       twenty-first century. Although it might seem to be a relic from the past, the wheels
      of the cart seem to be from a car, and there is an electricity or telephone connection.
        Furthermore, Ukrainian agriculture was forcibly modernised decades ago.
     Another case of a creole technology is the rejuvenated ‘country-
     boat’ of Bangladesh, a country where millions depended on water
     transport. These boats, hand built by itinerant and miserably poor
     boat carpenters (mistri), increasingly lost out to land transport. It
     was in the north-west of Bangladesh that they were transformed in
     the early 1980s. New wells, powered by petrol pumps, were installed
     there, but these were idle most of the year. An anonymous engineer
     used one of these engines to drive a boat; by the late 1980s many were
     used in the wet season and on market days in the dry season. Increas-
     ingly engines were permanently fitted, but irrigation-pump engines
    remained the most popular since they were subsidised. In the 1980s
     iron sheet started to be used to make boats, and for bigger boats,
     recycled steel plates from the shipbreakers on the coast.**
      The cycle-rickshaws, the motorised country-boats, the long-tailed

 boats, as well as the buildings of the shanty towns, combine the
 products of large-scale industry — the car engine, the bicycle, cement,
 asbestos-cement — and the local and small scale. These were deriva-
 tive, adapted technologies. But they were more than that — for they
 were local adaptations that gave new life to older, more traditional
 forms. This hybridity was common. In many parts of the world
 donkey carts were made using motor-car axles and especially wheels.
 Wooden fishing boats of the most primitive sort were made much
 more efficient by synthetic fishing nets; larger wooden boats of craft
 construction were fitted with engines, with radar and with sonar, as a
 visit to any number of the world’s small fishing ports will confirm.
 Retro and reappearance
 In the rich world there have also been many reintroductions of ‘old’
 technology. Cable TV was a disappearing technology in the 1950s and
 19608, yet returned with a vengeance in the 1980s, as a seemingly new
 form promising ever more TV channels. Indeed cables in general
 returned, though often in the form of fibre-optic cables which carried
 many times more traffic than copper ones. The use of condoms
 expanded massively through the twentieth-century, then declined
 with the introduction of the Pill and other new contraceptives, but
 growth resumed following the appearance of AIDS. Acupuncture,
 known in Europe from the seventeenth century, had a boom in the
 early nineteenth, from which it slowly declined in Europe till it re-
 emerged in the 1970s. The passenger liner gave way to the airliner
 in the late 1950s and early 1960s, yet many were converted to cruise
 ships in the 1960s and 1970s, developing an industry which at the end
 of the twentieth century carried more passengers than ever before.
 Cruise ships take over 8 million passengers on holiday; the greatest
 passenger port in the world is now Miami. The biggest liners ever built
 were no longer the interwar behemoths such as the Normandie or the
 Queen Elizabeth, but a new generation dating from the last years of
 the twentieth century. One company has built the largest sailing ship
 ever made, based on the Preussen of 1902, for the luxury cruise market.

     The Royal Clipper, delivered in 2000, was built at the former Lenin
     Shipyard in Gdansk and the Dutch Merwede yard. The Harland and
     Wolff shipyard in Belfast gets regular enquiries about rebuilding the
      ill-fated Titanic as a cruise liner. Airships are used for televising major
     events, and for taking tourists over great cities.
      The Ambassador and the Bullet were sold back into the rich world
     from whence they came decades earlier. Old treadle sewing machines
     made for the poorest markets are also sold as replicas in the rich
     world.** Luxury mechanical watches, such as those of Patek Philippe,
      are still made. Before 1988, when it converted to making diesel loco-
     motives, the Datong Locomotive Works in China, exported steam
     locomotives to the USA for use on tourist lines.** Among gun afi-
     cionados in the USA an industry grew up making working replicas
     of nineteenth-century rifles. Antique cameras and replicas of classics,
     notably Leicas, sell to a discerning clientele, and vinyl records have a
      distinct niche market.
      One of the most important novelties in food production and
     consumption has involved, according to Tim Mondavi of the Cali-
     fornia wine-maker Mondavi, ‘moving forward to the past. Mondavi
     introduced oak fermentation barrels and other ‘old’ technology to
      their high-tech winery and vineyards.” The production of ‘organic’
     foods has a special relationship with the past. Part of the claim of
     the organic movement is that organic production is less damaging
      to the environment and more conducive to animal and human
     health. Central to the practice is the abandonment of the use of
     synthetic fertilisers, pesticides and fungicides. Yet organic certifica-
     tion rules allow for the use of many of the materials which were
     standard in late nineteenth-century agriculture, such as mined and
     crushed phosphate rock as fertiliser. Guano use is permitted under
     certain circumstances, as are nineteenth-century copper-based fun-
     gicides such as Bordeaux and Burgundy mixtures, though allowed
     quantities are being restricted.
      Sailing cruise ships and other manifestations of retro take place
     in a world which is radically different from the one in which sailing

 ships dominated sea transport and where synthetic fertilisers were not
 available. Corrugated iron roofs and the bicycle were the products of
 modern industries, of a world whose productive capacity was trans-
 formed in the twentieth century. Yet in that remarkable story too, the
 seemingly old was much more important than we sometimes care to
 recognise.

             Production
     The output of the world economy has increased much faster than a
     rapidly growing population through most of the twentieth century.
     One period stands out for particularly rapid growth and change: the
     three decades after the Second World War. These years saw output
     increases which were unprecedented in world history and have not
     been seen since then in the rich countries. As important historical
     transition periods go, it is rather modestly named. It is called the ‘long
     boom; or the ‘golden age’, terms which do not conjure up revolution-
     ary change. In technological history — if considered at all — it tends to
     be relegated to a third or fourth industrial revolution. But in many
     parts of the world, including much of Europe, this was the period of
     the first industrial revolution, as employment shifted decisively from
     agriculture into industry and services. It was an era when productive
     processes increased very rapidly in efficiency, turning out long-known
     products at ever lower prices. That process has continued since, with
     unprecedented rates of growth, in the poor world.
      The usual story of production goes like this: there has been a
      shift in employment and output from agriculture to industry and
     then to services. The first is labelled the industrial revolution. The
     second is called a transition to post-industrial, knowledge or infor-
     mation societies, linked to what many called post-modernism, what
     some Marxists called ‘new times’, and, what capitalist Wall Street
     gurus called the ‘new economy’' In one version peddled in the 1990s,

```

-----

```
  modern economies are becoming ‘weightless’ and ‘dematerialised’.
  Such accounts resurrect an old argument, as if it had never been made
  before, that in future it will not be land or capital which will have
  power, but knowledge. They promise, again, a world where ‘intellec-
  tual property’ and ‘human capital’ rule.
   Yet this stage theory of history, focusing on shares of employment,
  easily misrepresents the whole. In the twentieth century the output
  of agriculture expanded enormously and it continues to do so. The
  long boom saw the most radical revolution in the history of rich-
  country agriculture: productivity increase was so rapid that employ-
  ment decreased even as output increased. Industrial output expanded
  enormously and continues to do so, even as employment in industry
  started to fall in the rich countries in the 1970s. Services too have long
  been growing. The expansion of employment in services is in part the
  extension of services that can be provided only by employing more
  people. To a very crude and counter-—intuitive first approximation,
  falling employment is not necessarily a measure of failure or back-
  wardness, but of rapid technical change. We should recognise too that
  the boundaries between these artificial categories are not as clear cut
  or revealing of underlying trends as they are made to seem. The killing
  of animals is usually classified under manufacturing industry, not
  agriculture; publishing as well as printing are manufacturing indus-
  tries; some maintenance activities come under services, together with
  transport.
   The tripartite division into agriculture, industry and services also
  misses a vitally important dimension — the non-market productive
  activities of households, a fundamental part of total production,
  whether in agriculture, industry or services. It has long been recog-
  nised that the standard national income (GDP) data in use since the
  1950s has not included non-traded goods and services.” Because there
  are no wages for most housework, it does not figure in most national
  accounts. Most unpaid work [in ] [the ] [rich ] [world ] [is ] [done ] [by ][women, ]
  though by no means all. The [one ] [area ] [where ] [men ] [do ] [more ] [than ]

     30 and more than 100 per cent of the conventionally measured GDP.

     larly in agriculture, as in the ‘peasant’ household, that great neglected

 economic and cultural unit of the twentieth century. The household
  is a good place to start.
 Household production
 The 1922 Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on ‘mass production’ noted
 of the ‘factory system’ that its first effect was ‘to emancipate the home
 from being a mere adjunct to the loom or bench, and its later effect
 was to provide the home with means to develop the dignified status
 which it has now attained’ Siegfried Giedion, a pioneer of the study of
  the mechanisation of the rich household wrote in 1948, that ‘One can
 hardly speak of household “production”’‘ There is much to be said for
  the rich household as a place where machines are used for consump-
  tion rather than production.
   Indeed domestic technologies of leisure deserve more serious con-
 sideration than they usually get in the history of technology. In the rich
 world the household was to take up technologies of leisure such as the
  radio, TV and video recorders much faster than washing machines or
 vacuum cleaners. The car and the telephone have behaved more like
  _ radio and television than washing machines and both were, at least at
  first, primarily leisure technologies.° Cars were for visiting and going on
  trips rather than travelling to work. The telephone, though first sold as a
 business tool, was very quickly taken up by women, for what telephone
 engineers saw as frivolous use — socialising and gossiping.° In largely
 family-run US farms in the 1920s the motor car diffused much faster
 than the truck or tractor.’ By 1920 there was the extraordinary total of 2
 million cars on US farms, compared with 250,000 tractors and 150,000
  trucks; by 1930 the number of cars reached about 4 million, where
  it stayed into the late 1950s.* In 1920 roughly half of all mid-western
  farms had cars, well over that had telephones, while less than 10 per
  cent had tractors, running water or electric lights; for 1930 80 per cent
 had cars, 60 per cent had telephones, 30 per cent had tractors, and 15—
  20 per cent had electric lights and running water.’ Around 40 per cent
 had radios in 1930.!° This pattern of acquisition by households would
 endure, however much some complained [that ] [slum ] [dwellers ] [bought ]

      televisions before sewing machines, or Japanese farmers of the 1950s
     bought gaudy tiles and kimonos rather than washing machines.
       Yet production remained a key role of the household. From at
      least the interwar years the wealthier households of rich countries
     were seen as places requiring new domestic technologies and a new
     scientific organisation of domestic work, devoted to the produc-
     tion of food, cleanliness, order. The seemingly private world of the
     domestic kitchen now had its own experts, pioneer social research-
      ers interested in the impact of modernity, students of budgets and
     of time use, activist promoters of new kinds of hygienic living, and
     proponents of ‘home economics’ ‘domestic science’ and ‘household
     engineering.'' Many of these studies were promoted by interested
     parties, for example the Rural Electrification Agency in the USA, the
      electric appliance manufacturers and industry-funded bodies such as
     the British Electrical Development Association. They would not have
     recommended one-woman domestic production for the manufacture
     of domestic appliances.
      One of the hoariest old clichés of the advertisers and the sponsored
     researchers was that new technologies in the home had relieved rich-
     world housewives of drudgery and given them leisure. Yet in the
     United States middle-class women had seen an increase in domestic
     work earlier in the century, with a decline only in the 1960s, long
      after the widespread use of new domestic technologies. Machines
     replaced domestic servants, changing the role of the middle-class
     housewife from supervisor of workers to machine-operator. The
     labour productivity of domestic work increased, but this led not to
      a decrease in work, but rather to increased domestic production. By
     how much domestic productivity and production have increased,
     and how this compares with large-scale industry or with agriculture
      is unclear, for the outputs of this sort of domestic production are
     not measured. Despite its importance in the provision of so many
     quickly changing outputs from increasingly clean clothes to many
     new types of domestically prepared food, this vast world of produc-
     tion is hardly charted.

   But we can say something about the tools of household production.
  The machine tools of the rich home were very different, generally, from
  those of industry, as were the non-machine tools. These tools were
  called ‘consumer durables’ and not ‘producer durables’; they were
  not an ‘investment’ but ‘consumption’. The tools of the household
  were the product of large-scale industry and scientific investigation,
  and many were cheapened very considerably by mass production.”
  So dominant did some firms become that trade names were not just
  familiar, but sometimes became the generic name: we have only to
  think of Singer or Hoover to make the point.
   Even seemingly old-fashioned tools were remade by large corpora-
  tions. One particularly long-lived, though not widely diffused, type
  of cooking range which is now associated with nineteenth-century
  domesticity, provides an interesting case. The AGA range was launched
  in 1929, the product of a very large and inventive Swedish firm (AGA
   — or, in English, “gas accumulator company’) that in the interwar
  years made, among other things, cars, radios and film equipment.
  The president of the company, who oversaw its growth between 1909
  and 1937, was Nils Gustav Dalén, winner of the 1912 Nobel prize in
  physics,'* for his work on inventions concerning the storage and use
  of acetylene, and the related automatic lighthouse, which launched
  the company on its path to success. Dalén personally developed the
  AGA range, making it the most fuel efficient ever made, in the sense
  that it converted a high proportion of fuel into usable heat. By 1934
  it was being sold worldwide and was later manufactured in some
  ten countries. AGA stopped making them in 1957, but production
  continued in Britain; indeed still does.'* Another long-lived technol-
  ogy, it acquired the patina of retro-chic in an era when the major
  expansion was in gas and electric ranges.
   Gas and electric ranges, like the AGA, did not change radically from
  their introduction in the late nineteenth [century ] [to ] [the ] [present. ] [The ]
  novelties in domestic production [technology ] [have ] [been ] [few. ] [Baths, ]

     all available in the interwar years, and most long before that. Most
    have remained much the same for many decades. The extent of use has
    been a story not of time and innovation, but economics, and the avail-
     ability of inputs, such as electricity, gas and piped water. As countries
    became richer they acquired more of them. And they became richer
    by producing more and more of them. The levels of consumption of
    motor cars, washing machines, telephones and the like which were
     seen in the United States in the 1920s were not to be found in the rich
    parts of Europe until the 1950s and 1960s. They would spread to the
     rest of the world later still.
    The sewing machine and the spinning wheel
    A particularly good example of the complex history of household
    technology, not least because of its global diffusion, is provided by the
    sewing machine. In the rich countries the watch, bicycle, piano and
    sewing-machine industries were very much in the vanguard of the
    new consumer-durable industry in the years before the Great War.’
    The sewing machine was produced on a huge scale by essentially one
    global enterprise, the Singer Sewing Machine Company, a pioneer
    not only in mass production but in mass selling through credit. In
     1905 Singer had the then very large number of 30,000 workers making
    sewing machines in eight factories round the world, but they were
    dwarfed by the global sales force of 61,444 in more than 4,000 branch
     offices.'® Singer, with perhaps 90 per cent of world market (outside
     the USA) was selling around 2.5 million machines before the Great
    War, with around 1.3 million coming from the Clydebank plant in
    Scotland.”
     Through the twentieth century sewing-machine production would
     increase. In the late 1960s Japan, by then a leading producer, made 4.3
     million, mostly for export.'* Thereafter production was to fall: by the
    mid-1990s it was down to 4 million worldwide: 2.3 million came from
    China, followed in order by Taiwan, then Japan, USA and Germany.”
     In China in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the sewing machine was one
    of ‘four big belongings’; the others were the wristwatch, the radio

  and the bicycle.” In the Chinese countryside in the mid-1980s, each
  farm family had ‘1 bicycle, about half had a radio, 43 per cent owned
  a sewing machine, 12 per cent had a television set, and about half the
  rural adults owned wristwatches.”!
   Essentially the same sewing machine was employed in various
  different contexts. Most went to homes, where they were used to
  make and mend family clothes, and to produce for the market, in vast
  putting-out systems. They were also installed in small sweatshops and
  packed into gigantic clothing factories as they developed from the
  1930s
   The sewing machine also provides a wonderful example of very
  long-lived models not only being kept in use, but continuing in pro-
  duction for a long time. Treadle-powered machines, not so different
  from those made before 1914, were, in the 1960s, ‘by far the most
  important modern appliance’ in a small town of the district of Huaylas
  in Andean Peru.” In Mae Hong Son, northern Thailand, in April 2002,
  treadle-operated Singers decorated with a sticker celebrating 150 years
  of Singer machines were on sale alongside white goods, next to an
  internet café. At the other end of the world, an expensive (male) tailor

  operated Singer.” Treadle-powered sewing machines feature regularly
  in discussions of micro-credit initiatives supported by international
  development agencies.
   The sewing machine had a very particular place in the thinking of
  Mahatma Gandhi, as exemplary of an alternative approach to produc-
  tion. Gandhi was a strong opponent of the machine-based industries
  and famously argued not for mass production, but for production
  by the masses. Yet, he made what he called ‘intelligent exceptions’
  to this hostility to industrially-made machines. “Take the case of the
  Singer Sewing Machine, he said. ‘It is one of the few useful things
  ever invented ...’ His interviewer responded that he could not object
  to the factories that made them, [to ] [which ] [Gandhi ] [replied ] [that ] [he ][was ]
  ‘Socialist enough to say that such [factories ] [should ] [be ][nationalized, ] [or ]
  State-controlled’, He claimed [that ] [the ][sewing ] [machine ] [was ] [‘but ] [one ] [of ]

     the exceptions I have in mind ... I would welcome any day a machine
     to straighten crooked spindles’ so that ‘when the spindle gets wrong
    every spinner will have a machine of his own to get it straight.” The
    key machine in Gandhi’s ideal world was not the sewing machine,
    but the spinning wheel, already a defunct technology in India. “The
    spinning wheel represents to me the hope of the masses, claimed
     Gandhi. ‘The masses lost their freedom, such as it was, with the loss
    of the charkha [spinning wheel]. The charkha supplemented the agri-
    culture of the villagers and gave it dignity. It was the friend and the
     solace of the widow. It kept the villagers from idleness. For the charkha
    included all the anterior and posterior industries — ginning, carding,
    warping, sizing, dyeing and weaving. These in their turn kept the
     village carpenter and the blacksmith busy.° He reintroduced the hand
    spinning wheel or charkha to India; and its image became part of the
    Indian National Congress flag.
    Tools and small trades
    Production by the masses characterised a great deal of productive
     activity by the poor in the twentieth century. It is perhaps not sur-
    prising that the symbol of the world Communist movement was not
    Henry Maudslay’s lathe, so celebrated by Marx, nor the spinning
    mules or the looms of the textile industry, also familiar from Marx, or
    the Model T. It was instead the hammer and the sickle, the first the key
     tool of the forge one might find in the countryside, and the second, a
    key instrument of unmechanised agriculture.
     Allthrough the twentieth century small enterprises operated with the
    simplest of tools. Even in manufacturing trades, between one quarter
    and a third of workers in Germany and France around 1900 worked
    alone.” Family-owned and run restaurants were serving 1 million
    meals a day in Paris in 1939, a figure which fell to 250,000 in 1950, due to
    the rise of factory and office canteens, though growth then resumed.”

    owned a mule and chickens and few possessions apart from some ‘rudi-
    mentary agricultural implements.” In a proclamation issued in June

      Travelling through the poor world it is hard to miss, today, a tiny
     metal-working shop, in both country and city districts, where the
     most complex bit of machinery may well be an oxyacetylene, or
     electric, torch for welding. At dusk bright intermittent light from
     welding illuminates streets all over the world, issuing from mainte-
     nance workshops which might also make simple equipment. Or think
     of the tiny businesses repairing electronic equipment based on the
     pavements of Bangkok, or the recyclers of tyres into shoes and many
     other goods, to be found in many poor cities.
     Family farms in the USA and the USSR
     The family farms of the North American Midwest were among the
     richest in the world at the beginning of the twentieth century. These
     farms were immensely productive, not in terms of land (for here
     European farmers were well ahead), but in terms of labour. From the
     1920s enormous numbers of Fordson tractors appeared: they could
     replace five horses, and plough three times as fast. A recent large
     tractor can plough thirty times faster than the horse team.” A key
     effect of the tractor was to reduce the amount of hired help on the
     Midwestern family-owned farm; this had the consequence too that
     the farmer’s wife was saved the work of feeding large numbers of hired
     workers, a standard practice, illustrating the blurred line between the
    home and the farm.” Interwar Midwest farm women were very heavily
     engaged in other non-domestic activities, tending gardens and raising
     poultry, and smaller but still significant proportions milked cows, did
     the bookkeeping and worked for a small part of the year in the fields.**
     Even after the Second World War well over 60 per cent of Midwest
     farms engaged in gardening, dairying and butchering; egg production
     was also still high. Farm women increasingly had off-farm employ-
     ment, and work in the fields, rather in these small-scale enterprises.*°
     How different the conditions in the Soviet Union! Consider the
     Volga German agricultural settlement of Brunnental in the mid-
     1920s. The farmers here were much poorer, and lived extraordinarily
     self-sufficient lives. Harvesting was done with the scythe, and for some

  farmers with reapers and binders; threshing was carried out with
  horse-powered machines, rarely with a motor-powered one. There
  was at least one Fordson tractor, but the settlement had to supply
  much of its own agricultural equipment. Horse-drawn wagons were
  built by hand, with the help of a lathe, by a cartwright and his two
  teenage sons. It took four weeks of heavy labour to make; the same
  process with modern power tools might take twenty hours. Signifi-
  cantly the chronicler who told the above story listed the occupations
  in the settlement by families not individuals: there were families of
   cabinet makers, shoemakers, tailors, plumbers, felt-makers, tanners,
  blacksmiths and millers.** There being no ready-made clothes, farmers’
  wives and daughters made them at home, often sewed entirely by
  hand, though the richer farmers’ wives had sewing machines. Clothes
  were made from raw wool; most houses had spinning wheels. Tailors
  were used only for heavy clothes.
    This world was brutally torn apart by collectivisation in 1929. The
  richer farmers were dispossessed of all their property and sent into
  internal exile and often death. The rest became semi-employed; some
  worked for the new central Machine Tractor Stations owned by the
   state which served three collective farms. Years of famine followed,
   until recovery came in the late 1930s. In 1941 all these Volga Germans
  were sent into internal exile in Siberia.
   By 1930 the very poor USSR had about a quarter of all Europe’s
   tractors, and two-thirds by 1939. There were many more tractors than
   cars in the countryside, where there was no electricity and no consumer
  goods of note. Collectivisation was not, however, driven by tractori-
  sation, but by a political imperative [to ] [change ] [the ] [class ] [structure ] [in ]
   the countryside, and to extract [grain ] [from ] [farms ] [to ] [feed ] [the ] [cities ]
  (and its new factories) and for [exports ] [to ] [pay ] [for ] [tractors ] [and ] [other ]
  capital goods. Collectivisation [went ] [much ] [faster ] [than ] [the ] [provision ]
   of tractors. In fact, it almost [certainly ] [reduced ] [the ] [power ] [available ]

     of 1929 to 15 million at the beginning of 1934.°” Rural crafts, including
     clothes making also fell, partly because skilled workers moved to the
     city, were dekulakised or were too poor.” In many villages collectivisa-
     tion brought about a retrogression in living standards and mechanical
    equipment.
      Before the Second World War, collective farms had an average of
    seventy-five households. After it, Soviet collective and state farms
    would grow even bigger. These vast farms of thousands of hectares
    and hundreds of households were stunningly unproductive and failed
     to increase Soviet agricultural output much at all. Production did
    increase in the 1960s and 1970s but only at a huge cost in investment
    and labour. Paradoxically collectivisation ensured the continuation
    of the garden plot that had disappeared from US agriculture. From
     1935 collective-farm households could operate a small plot to produce
    their own food, and could sell the surpluses. These family plots of
    approximately one acre would be very important indeed in meat, egg,
    vegetable and fruit production, right up to the present day.
    The agricultural revolution in the long boom
    The phrase ‘green revolutiom is applied to the introduction of new
     varieties, irrigation and fertiliser to agriculture in the poor world in
    the 1960s. Partly because agriculture is associated with poverty and
    the past, and because of the focus on novelty, the even more signifi-
    cant agricultural revolution in the rich world was missed.
      In the rich world agriculture in the long boom saw much greater
     rates of labour productivity change than industry or services, and at
    much greater rates than before.” In high land-productivity Britain,
    yields doubled in the post-war years from a very high base. New
    regimes of intensive agriculture through irrigation, and addition of
     artificial fertiliser (especially nitrate, largely produced by the Haber-
    Bosch process, innovated before the Great War) made plants grow fast
    and large. Plants were changed too. The introduction of hybrid corn
    (maize) in the US corn belt in the late 1930s and 1940s was just one
    example, though an important one, of new varieties being grown.”°

   While traditional rice-production systems in Asia yielded around 1
  tonne per hectare, at the beginning of the twentieth century Japanese
  farmers were getting 2.5 tonnes; Japanese farmers had doubled yields
 through irrigation in the nineteenth century; and in its colonies of
  Korea and Taiwan in the interwar years. Yet in the 1950s, though
  the Japanese countryside was still routinely regarded as ‘feudal’ and
 backward, human excrement, night soil, was still used as fertiliser.
 Very quickly new housing, running water, washing machines, televi-
  sions, and then refrigerators were brought in. Agricultural machinery
 became plentiful on small farms, giving a unique combination of
  highly mechanised and very intensive output of rice.*! Japan was to
  continue to lead the way in Asia in high productivity.” By the early
  1960s it was getting 5 tonnes per hectare, when the Asian average was
 around two. Even after the green revolution had long passed, Japan
  still led. Today it produces 7 tonnes per hectare, compared with half
  that in Bangladesh.
   The green revolution in rich countries made a huge impact on
  patterns of globai trade, belying the standard image of a poor agri-
  cultural world exporting food to a rich industrial world. The USA
 remained, for example, a major wheat exporter, but increasingly to the
 poor world. It exported wheat to the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s ona
 huge scale. It remains a major producer of raw cotton, whose principal
  export market was once Britain, but is now the poor countries of the
 world where the cotton-spinning industry is concentrated. China
 imports cotton from the USA, and sells it textiles. Government policy
  in rich countries protected land and labour-efficient agriculture from
  the cheaper but less efficiently produced products of the poor world.
   The gap in agricultural labour productivity between the rich world
 and the poor world, already large, widened after the Second World
 War.’ The green revolution in the poor countries mitigated a growing
 divergence between the agriculture of the rich world and that of the
 poor, but probably at the price of increasing inequalities within the poor
 world. A short Japanese wheat [variety, ] [the ][Norin ] [No. ] [10, ][was ] [the ][key ][to ]

     water and fertiliser. The IR8 rice variety was derived from dwarf strains
     developed in Taiwan in the interwar years by the Japanese.”
       In the rich world animal husbandry was industrialised in the long
     boom, particularly in the case of chickens and pigs. The extreme
     example is that of chickens. In 1960 there were around 4 billion chickens
     in the world, whereas at the end of the twentieth century there were 13
     billion. But the number killed for meat in a year has increased from 6
      billion to 45 billion. Chickens lived much shorter lives.* That was just
     one dimension to the industrialisation of the chicken. Since the 1930s
     the US broiler (eating) chicken has become bigger (nearly twice as
     heavy), younger (about half the age), and has taken much less feed to
     bring it to the size needed (less than half).*° This was done by making
     significant changes in both the nurture and the nature of chickens.
     A key series of steps was taken in the 1930s, among them bringing
     the chickens indoors, which required supplementing their diet with
     vitamin D, the use of electric lighting and artificial incubation. The
     intensive study of chicken feed resulted, by the 1950s, in a standard
     corn-and-soybean-based diet. The 1950s saw the breeding of hybrid
     chickens adapted to these artificial nurturing regimes. Many had been
     winners of “The chicken of tomorrow contest’.
      Pig production too was industrialised. Although the keeping of
     single pigs had disappeared in Britain by mid-century, even in the early
     1960s half of all pigs were in herds with fewer than twenty breeding
     sows; by the 1990s 95 per cent were in herds of more than 100 breeding
     sows. Most lived, like broilers, indoors, and were, like the chickens, new
     sorts of fast-growing hybrids.”” At the end of the century million-pig
     installations were being developed. Yet the greatest expansion in the
    number of pigs since the 1960s was in fact to be in non-industrialised
     pigs, kept in small numbers by farming households and fed with a
     variety of foods. In 1960 China had a quarter of the world’s pigs, but
     today it has around half of the world’s one billion pigs, not surpris-
     ingly because pork remains the staple meat in China, and meat eating
     has increased markedly. More than 80 per cent are still produced on a
     small scale, by non-specialist producers.

 Industry and mass production
 We have told the story of production in terms of household produc-
  tion, agriculture, and small firms. Yet the standard image of twentieth-
  century production is centred on mass production. The central idea is
  that the twentieth century, especially during the long boom, saw pro-
 duction dominated by the large-scale production of standard parts.
  Asa result of this mass production, efficiency of production increased
  dramatically. This led to unprecedented rates of economic growth and
  material well-being for the working classes now employed in gigantic
  factories and firms.
   Mass production has had extraordinary effects, which are difficult
  to grasp.** At the beginning of the twentieth century one could build
  a house for the price of a car. Today, in the rich world, one would
  get little more than a small extension to a house for the price of an
 immensely more complex motor car. This is despite the decrease in
  costs of bricks, concrete, doors and windows, and any number of
  fittings, which are now mass produced. To take a biological example:
  the price of chicken has fallen much faster than beef. This observa-
  tion suggests we should not equate mass production with modern
 production as a whole, even in rich countries since houses and beef
  are still produced. Even within manufacturing industry mass produc-
  tion accounted for a small proportion of production. In 1969 75 per
  cent of US industrial production was batch produced, even though
  in engineering mass-produced components were ten to thirty times
  cheaper.” Yet there were very important increases in efficiency which
  did not come from the sort of mass production we associate with the
  car industry, or the making of refrigerators. Across the board produc-
  tive processes were becoming more efficient.
   For example, the scale of Haber-Bosch ammonia plants increased,
 and the inputs, such as hydrogen, were produced in cheaper ways too.
 The result was ever larger quantities of cheap nitrogen fertiliser, which
  had a dramatic effect, combined with other inputs, in increasing the
 productivity of land. Another powerful [example ] [might ][be ][the ][increas- ]
 ing efficiency of the use of fuel, [labour ] [and ] [capital ] [in ][power ] [stations. ]

         u1. The construction of fast, motor torpedo boats out of wood for the US Navy in the
      Second World War. They were built undercover, of pre-fabricated sections. Production
       techniques for seemingly old products and materials were changing just as they were
                         in ‘new’ industries.
     The key was larger power stations operating at higher temperatures.
     Another would be the explosion in the efficiency of ships after the
     Second World War, particularly oil tankers and similar vessels. Growth
      in the size of ships was crucial to the sustained reduction that took
     place in freight rates. In the case of crude oil, for example, transport
      costs decreased rapidly as a proportion of crude-oil prices. World
      steel production trebled between 1950 and 1970, with plants becoming
     much larger. In other sectors production increased radically in effi-
      ciency, but without necessarily needing increases in scale. Agriculture
      is a good example.
     Cars in the long boom
     The mass production of motor cars was pioneered in the United States

```
  by one company and one car, Ford and the Model T. At its peak in the
  1920s the Model T was produced at an annual rate of 2 million, and
  by the time production ceased in 1927 15 million had been built. Ford
  was at this time easily the largest car manufacturer in the world, and
  had made America easily the most motorised nation in the world.
  Even the richest parts of Europe would not reach 1920s’ levels of US
  motorisation until the late 1950s, let us recall.
   The great boom in car production after the Second World War was
  largely an American and European affair, with the European makers
  growing faster, though from a much lower base. In each nation
  the great car firms were regarded as powerhouses of the booming
  economies. Even in a poor country such as Italy, car ownership went
  up more than ten-fold in the fifteen years between 1950 and 1964; from
  0.34 million to 4.7 million cars. The number of cars just overtook
  motorcycle numbers, which increased from 0.7 to 4.3.°° Between 1955
  and 1970, 2.7 million Fiat 500s were made and 3.6 million Fiat 600s
  between 1957 and 1975.°' European car workers were not yet able to
  buy cars themselves, but would be doing so by the late 1960s.”
   In the long boom the Eastern European economies, like those in
  the West, grew very fast. Yet, the Soviet Union and its allies, for all
  the emphasis on standardised production and the possibility at least
  of plenty for the masses, were places of low consumption. Even in
  the 1960s the superpower USSR made only 1 per cent of the world’s
  private vehicles, and 12 per cent of commercial ones; in comparison
  Britain made 10 per cent of the cars, and 9 per cent of the trucks.°°
  So committed were the Soviets to mass production that they suffered
  from ‘premature mass production, the putting into production of not
  properly tested goods.** But mass consumption in the richest countries
  was more typically about the extensive multiplication of firms, styles,
  types, rapid model change, the pursuit of endless novelty.”
   The mass-producing car industry informed a whole understand-
  ing of modern production. It was modern industry, the place where
  the pace was set. The post-war years were labelled with such terms as
  ‘Fordism’ at least when the mass [production ] [of ][cars ] [in ] [Europe ] [and ]

```

-----

```
    North America ceased to grow fast from the 1970s. Rapidly expanding
     Japanese car production became a model for “Post-Fordism. But just
     as the significance of mass production, or ‘Fordism’ was exaggerated,
     so were reports of its demise. At the end of the twentieth-century Ford
     had capacity in Europe to build 2 million cars a year; one factory was
    making 400,000 Focuses per annum, and another 330,000 Mondeos.
     In 1996 Volkswagen worldwide turned out over 800,000 Golfs, the car
     that took over the production record from the Beetle, which itself took
     over from the Model T. The world’s largest car producers in 2000, still
     Ford and General Motors, were producing around 8 million vehicles
     each per annum, many times more than in the interwar years. Even in
     Britain more cars are produced today than ever before, and at world
     level production is not only increasing, but is still dominated by North
     America, Europe and Japan.
    Service industries
    There is no doubt that the rise of employment in the service indus-
     tries in the rich countries is one of the major economic changes of
     the last thirty years. A number of analysts have, perversely, identified
     this growth in service employment with the rise of an ‘information
     society, with connotations of weightlessness, or indeed the ‘dema-
     terialised’ economy. This was a fashionable, and misleading, way of
     saying little more than that service industries now account for very
     large proportions of GDP and employment.® This is partly the result
     of mis-specification because services include a vast range of activities,
    many of them far from weightless or indeed new. Services include
    transportation, by road, rail, water and air, telecommunications and
     postal services, the retail sector, as well as banking and finance, and
     small creative industries. That such a sector is weightless is immedi-
     ately contradicted by the sheer bulk of the things associated with it, the
    unprecedented weight of stuff in the shops, the piles of paper in any
     office, not to mention the proliferation of computers, fax machines
    and Xeroxes. One need only look at homes in the rich world to see
    they are crammed with stuff, which is why storage is a growth industry

 and moving house becomes a bigger and bigger affair. In 2003 research
  for a British insurance company suggested the existence of £3.2bn-
 worth of unused goods, headed by sandwich toasters, electric knives,
  soda streams, foot spas, and ice-cream makers. There are 3.8 million
 unused fondue sets.*” One source of confusion is that vast quantities
 of stuff used in service industries and in homes are imported, rather
 than produced domestically, but that is a different issue. The USA and
 Britain have large trade deficits in manufactured goods, which means
 that they use more than they produce; that is not to say that manufac-
 turing ceases to be important to them.
  The idea that manufacturing is not important, that what really
 matters is branding and design, is one of those confusions arising
 from thinking about only part of a story. The idea arises from the
 observation that in rich countries some giant enterprises are in
 retailing and control brands — the value is added by these activities,
 not in production. Yet branding and adding value through design are
 hardly new — they went along with manufacture, often in the same
 large company, as in the cases of Singer, or Ford or General Electric.
 We should not confuse the siting of economic activity with its sig-
 nificance. For the concentration of branding, marketing and design
  in rich countries, and production in poor countries, does not mean
 that production is no longer important. Indeed it is precisely because
 of the radical cheapening of manufactures through mass production
 and the use of very cheap labour, that they seem so unimportant to
 the rich. The point about manufacturing and mass production is that
 the latter produces goods extraordinarily cheaply, and does so all over
 the world. Massive economies of scale are exploited as never before on
  a global level to produce cheap mass-produced goods of great com-
 plexity. Think of cheap PCs, mobile phones and IKEA furniture. Mass
 production is now so common it is invisible.
  At the beginning of the twenty-first century Wal-Mart is the largest
 corporation in the world, by annual sales ($300bn in 2005/6) and by
 employee numbers. With nearly 2 million workers it is vastly larger
 not only than the biggest firms of 1900, but also than the very largest

     manufacturing employers of the 1960s. But it is a retailer, not a manu-
      facturer. Indeed it indirectly employs many more millions, largely in
     China, mass producing all sorts of stuff for the American consumer.
     IKEA, again principally a retailer and designer, controls the mass
     manufacture of furniture, indirectly employing an estimated 1 million
     workers. Indeed IKEA provides a wonderful example of the arguments
     of this book. First, of the continuing significance of what we take to
     be old, in this case not just furniture, but wooden furniture, supplied,
     obviously, by forests. In terms of industry it exemplifies beautifully
     the extension rather than the retreat of mass production, and its glo-
     balisation, producing fantastically cheap outputs. In terms of service
     industries it is an example of mass retailing and mass consump-
     tion of identical goods (it has made 28 million Billy bookcases since
     launch in 1978); it is also an example of the reduction of transport
      costs by flat-packing, and an example of the concentration of design
     and marketing activity in a rich country (Sweden). As a domestic
     industry it is an example of a family-owned firm, and indeed one
     which provides goods to be transported home by non-paid domestic
     workers, and assembled by them too. Such products made its founder
     and owner, it is alleged, the richest man in the world, richer than Bill
     Gates of Microsoft, who had briefly taken first place following the
     death of Walton of Wal-Mart.
      One of the great novelties of the last quarter or so of the twentieth
     century was the emergence of poor countries as suppliers to the world
     not of food and raw materials, but of manufactures. The case of China
      is all the more extraordinary given its history as a Communist nation
     and one which had had a very particular approach to modern industry.
     The Chinese had systematically promoted old small-scale technolo-
      gies in the 1950s. In the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early
     19708, there was a concerted attack on the division between managers
     and workers — a distinction central to Taylorism and Fordism, and an
     attack too on the division of labour itself.°* Small-scale rural industries
     were promoted, as during the earlier Great Leap Forward. Although
     the Chinese economy grew, it did so very unstably and relatively slowly.

```

-----

```
  After 1976 the Chinese Communist party changed direction, and with
  the abolition of collective farming and the move to household farming
  in the 1980s, presided over a productivity surge in Chinese agriculture.
  In this same period rural industries grew at a phenomenal rate, many
  times that of the Chinese economy as a whole. Local ‘township and
  village enterprises’ were the key to this growth. The transformation of
  the Chinese countryside in the last twenty years is surely the fastest
  and deepest in world history, affecting many hundreds of millions of
  people.”
    Millions, often women, left the countryside, and, housed in dor-
  mitories, toiled for pitiful wages in the factories of the new industrial
  areas. Chinese growth has been dependent on overseas investment,
  primarily from Japan, Taiwan and from overseas Chinese elsewhere.
  Multinational enterprise, Japanese included, has also been important.
  In these respects the industrialisation of China has been very different
  from that of Japan. Market Stalinism and foreign investment were
  critical in China’s drive to industrialise. Despite its scale and speed
  and its impact on the global economy, the growth of China is not
  the product of a profoundly new economy. It has a distinctly old feel
  to it.
   At the beginning of the twenty-first century China was sucking in
  vast quantities of heavy raw materials, from oil to copper, driving up
  world prices. It became easily the largest steel producer in the world,
  with rates of growth comparable to those of steel in the long boom.
  The ‘new economy was being replaced by a very old economy driven
  by commodity prices. Far from the information superhighway being
  the conduit for all this new production, it was none other than the
  ship that carried the great bulk of Chinese production, and indeed
  world trade as a whole. In the year 2000 the world merchant fleet was
  rated at 553 million gross registered tonnes (a measure of the carrying
  capacity of ships), up from 227 million in 1970, 85 million in 1950 and
  45 million in 1914. As its scale suggested, it carried more material than
  ever before in history, and so cheaply that the price of manufactures
  was hardly affected by freight rates. This industry employed some

     1 million seamen, with a majority of officers from rich countries and
     a majority of ratings from poor countries, largely in Asia.
     Most shipping still transports fuel and bulks such as ore and
     grain, yet manufactures were very important too, largely carried in
     that great invention of the 1950s, the container. Since then global
     container traffic, which now dominates all sea traffic excepting bulks,
     has continued to increase. At the beginning of the twenty-first century
     the largest container ships, at 90,000 GRIT, could carry over 8,000 con-
     tainers, with a crew of just nineteen. The majority of the vessels were
    manufactured in the East. Wal-Mart is the largest single importer of
     containers in the USA, bringing in half a million every year, mostly
    from China.
     The great long boom and the more recent boom in the East, China
     in particular, far from being primarily cases of successive technologi-
     cal revolutions, are in many ways inflexions of the same technological
    and industrial revolution happening in succession. Of course it is far
    from identical, but the similarities are striking: the huge increase in
     agricultural productivity, the expansion of industry — not least the old
     classics such as steel making — and the expansion of ship-borne inter-
     national trade. In both cases the revolutionary nature of each era is
    masked by a deep political stability in the growing countries. Politics,
     the nation and borders matter.

          Maintenance
  Many of the great dystopian novels of the twentieth century look
  forward to a future society which is more technically advanced than the
  present, but one that was stagnant. These were technological societies
  without innovation. Thus the technological societies in Zamyatin’s We,
  Huxley’s Brave New World and Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-four were not
  revolutionary or progressive, even technologically. These are worlds of
  order without change, which have to be kept going. They are threat-
  ened by curious outlaws. Terry Gilliam in his dystopian film of the
  1980s, Brazil, captured both aspects of this literature. The innovative
  touch was that to the viewer the technology was no longer futuristic,
  but clearly an extrapolation to the present of 1940s’ technology. So too
  were the values of the society that used them. There were many refer-
  ences to maintenance, not just of the social order, but the technical
  order too. Repairmen from a central office appear as hideous agents of
  the state, and plastic surgery, maintenance for the human body, recurs
  as a theme. There is also, in the form of Robert De Niro, an outlaw
  repairman, who not only repairs the system, but is free from it.
   One of the most enduring ideas about technology in the twentieth
  century suggests that the essentially human has been taken over by
  the artificial. Nightmares about breakdown of the complex world of
  artifice that makes modern life possible propel deep concerns about
  the need for discipline, order and stability to keep the system going.
  As one philosopher of technology noted in the 1970s: ‘In almost no

     instance can artificial-rational systems be built and left alone. They
     require continued attention, rebuilding, and repair. Eternal vigilance
     is the price of artificial complexity. ! He noted too, that in a technologi-
     cal age we should ask not who governs, but what governs: ‘government
    becomes the business of recognising what is necessary and efficient
     for the continued functioning and elaboration of large-scale systems
    and the rational implementation of their manifest requirements.”
     One particularly striking evocation of such thinking in the post-
     war years compared the modern condition to ancient dependence
     on the control of water. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and China
    depended on constant vigilance over, and maintenance and repair of,
    complex irrigation systems. It was argued that this required a huge
     all-powerful state: these ancient ‘hydraulic societies’ were necessarily
     not democratic. The implication was that Asiatic and despotic tradi-
     tions, quite different from those which led to feudalism and capital-
     ism, were crucial in shaping both the Soviet Union and Communist
     China.° Yet similar analogies were also applied to the capitalist West.
    A famous American student of technology, Lewis Mumford, writing
     in the early 1960s, regarded the ancient ‘pyramid age’ as one charac-
     terised by ‘authoritarian technics’, which he saw as a historical alterna-
     tive to ‘democratic technics’ Yet, in the post-Second World War years,
     particularly in the United States, Mumford saw a new authoritarian
     technics appearing, a kind of ‘occidental despotism’. Mumford was a
     savage critic of this new manifestation of a world controlled by raw
    power and systemic technologies.‘
      For many analysts in the twentieth century the nature of tech-
    nology itself was responsible for this new authoritarianism. It was
    argued that technology was becoming ever greater in scale, more
    interconnected, more centrally controlled and more critical for the
    maintenance of human life. An example might be electricity supply
      — organised on a massive scale as an interconnected system on which
    we were all dependent. This led to ever greater danger of failure, since
     a failure could lead to total breakdown. The consequence was not only
     the need for greater requirements for vigilance and maintenance of

 the technology, but a society itself increasingly disciplined to avoid
 breakdowns. A society with nuclear power stations was, in this view, a
 society that needed to be heavily policed.
          a
 Much of the discourse on technology is a commentary on philosophi-
 cal and other writings on technology. There is a danger that descrip-
 tions of technology turn into realities which are used to explain
 the nature of modern society. The history of maintenance provides
 some important insights into the questions of discipline and order in
 relation to modern technology. It will also force us to rethink some
 standard economic categories and to reconsider important aspects of
 the history of work and production, not least that of engineers.
   Just like land, buildings and people, things have had to be main-
 tained, repaired and looked after, often for very long periods. Although
 central to our relationship with things, maintenance and repair are
 matters we would rather not think about. Mundane and infuriating,
 full of uncertainties, they are among the major annoyances surround-
 ing things. The subject is left in the margins, often to marginal groups.
 So low has been the status of “maintenance engineering’ that attempts
 were made, with some success, to rename it ‘terotechnology.’ The
 term ‘terotechnology, apparently coined by a British government
 committee in the 1960s, derives from the Greek teros, meaning to
 watch, observe, guard, and as it happens is singularly appropriate.
  That we neglect maintenance when we think and write about
 our technology is an instance of the great gulf there is between our
 everyday understanding of our dealing with things and the formal
 understandings enshrined in, for example, our histories. For in popular
 culture maintenance is well known. The tale of ‘my grandfather’s axe’
 is familiar in many forms. We hear too that the lifetime maintenance
 costs of an aeroplane will often exceed the cost of purchase. For all
 that the extraordinary cheapness and ‘weightlessness’ of computers
 and software are celebrated, we know there is no escape from the

     need to pay a fortune for technical support and maintenance. On one
     estimate, the initial cost of a PC is but 10 per cent of the total lifetime
      cost, including installation, repair, upgrades, training. Microsoft has
      certified more than 1.5 million engineers and administrators for their
     software around the world. One US estimate is that maintenance
     represents 60 per cent of the total lifetime cost of the more complex
     military equipment. Maintenance and repair often result in changes;
     they are closely connected, in some cases, to remodelling.
    How important are maintenance and repair?
     The problem of maintenance becomes visible when it is lacking. For
     example, the United Nations became concerned about bad main-
     tenance in the poor world in the late 1960s, noting that it was par-
      ticularly bad for capital-scarce countries, since lack of maintenance
     reduced the life of expensive assets such as tractors or industrial

  machinery, and also meant that they were under-used.° The vitally
  important, usually invisible, ‘routine, repetitive and even tedious
  work’ of maintenance has been ignored in development projects with
  inevitable consequences.’ Hand water pumps introduced in India in
  the 1960s with no provision for their maintenance soon falling into
  disrepair is one example. Accounts of the history of Soviet agricul-
  ture abound with side comments about the terrible waste resulting
  from poor maintenance of tractors and other farm machinery, noting,
  for example, that the problem became even worse with the abolition
  of the Machine Tractor Stations in 1958. More recently, development
  experts have noted the waste of resources in poor countries resulting
  from the failure to maintain roads. More has to be spent rebuilding
  than would have had to be spent maintaining them.
   Maintenance has lived in a twilight world, hardly visible in the formal
  accounts societies make of themselves. In the economic and produc-
  tion statistics, for example, it is invisible. In the standard economic
  imagery there is investment and then use of capital goods, but no
  maintenance or repair, except partially and incidentally. Partly for
  technical reasons, national accounts do not separately identify main-
  tenance and repair since they are often done in-house, and thus do not
  appear as a separate cost. Spare parts and so on are lost among other
  purchases of goods. However, Canada does have statistics on mainte-
  nance, because for many years an investment questionnaire also asked
  about maintenance and repair expenditure. Expenditures averaged
  over the period 1961-93 were about 6 per cent of gross domestic
  product (GDP). This was a very great deal more than expenditure on
  invention and innovation, but considerably lower than expenditure on
  investment, which was about 10-30 per cent of GDP for rich countries.
  Yet, in the Canadian case, the maintenance of equipment, as opposed
  to structures, amounted to 50 per cent of investment expenditure.®
  Other estimates are few and far between. An isolated figure for 1934
  US manufacturing and mining suggests that maintenance and repair
  cost as much as investment in new plant and equipment.’ In Swit-

     and maintenance of roads was greater than on the building of new
     roads.!° In the mid-1950s some 60 per cent of what non-rural Austra-
     lian businesses were spending on investment was on maintenance and
     repair. In New South Wales alone, the rural sector spent 34 per cent
     of what it spent on investment (including dwellings) on maintenance
     and repair.'' In the late 1960s Britain was spending around £3bn on
     maintenance, under 10 per cent of GDP, at a time when investment
     accounted for 20 per cent.'? For the USA in the late 1980s, renovation
     and rehabilitation of buildings were one and a half times the spend on
     new building, and came in at 5 per cent of GDP.'° These are estimates
     of the direct costs of maintenance only. Further costs arise because
     for every power station, locomotive, aeroplane, machine tool being
     maintained, an additional one is needed to maintain output. Reducing
    maintenance cost and time could have a dramatic impact not just on
     direct costs, but on capital and investment costs too.
    Maintenance
     The inventing of things has been concentrated in a few places; the
    making of things is much more widely distributed; the using of
     things is usually much more widely distributed still. (In some cases
    making is more widespread than use, for example where a ship or a
     building is made from parts manufactured in many different places.)
    Maintenance is almost as widely distributed as use. As a consequence,
    maintenance and repair are the most widespread forms of technical
     expertise. Maintenance and repair have been the realm of the small
     trader and skilled workers. They were different from, marginal to
     and yet interdependent with the great systems of technics. A good
    example would be the motor car, manufactured on a large scale in a
     few places in the world, but maintained and repaired in innumerable
    workshops the world over. More than that, a great deal of mainte-
     nance and repair activity takes place outside the formal economy,
     pointing to the importance of widespread technical skills. Domestic
    sewing for the repair of clothing, for example, was once a nearly
     universal female skill, and still is in many parts of the world.

```
   Unfortunately we are not in a position to give an overview of the
 main trends in the history of maintenance and repair. Has mainte-
 nance as a proportion of output gone up or down? Where there has
 been a trade-off between initial cost and maintenance, what have
 producers and consumers gone for? How has this changed over time?
  In some areas it seems there has been a reduction in maintenance, for
 example in aviation and in trains, perhaps in ships too. But in rich
 countries, as far as domestic equipment is concerned, and in industry
 for IT hardware, repair no longer exists — from electric toasters to
  fridges, repair is hardly worth carrying out — and not surprisingly the
 networks of retailer/repairers are long gone. A new toaster retails for
  less than an hour of repair time. More spectacularly perhaps, most
  bits of domestic equipment operate for their whole lives without even
 needing oiling or adjusting in any way.'4
   Furthermore, maintenance is itself becoming highly concentrated
 and controlled. In the case of cars, the complex electronics in the
 vehicle means that only approved repair workshops with the correct
 equipment can even begin to work out what is wrong with a car.
  In poorer parts of the world, the relationship between initial cost
 and the cost of maintenance and repair appears to be different, and
 reminiscent in some respects of the position in rich countries earlier
 in the century. Where maintenance and repair are cheap compared
  to initial purchase, things will have longer lives. Furthermore, things
 will move from a low-maintenance regime to a high-maintenance
 one as they get older. Thus, the movement of second-hand goods
  — from consumer goods to capital goods — from rich countries,
 where it is not worth keeping them going, to poor, maintenance-
  intensive countries. There is a huge trade in old cars, domestic
 equipment, power stations and clothes from the rich to the poor
 world. However, there is every possibility that the products of rich
 countries may no longer be maintainable in poor countries — the
 modern motor car being an example.

     Mass production and the art of car maintenance
     The early motor industry provides an example of the importance of
     maintenance, and how this differed in various times and contexts.
     The electric car was popular in the early days of motoring, but battery
     maintenance required skills and experience very different from the
     purely mechanical ones needed for petrol engines. The electric vehicle
     required specialised facilities for recharging and maintaining batteries,
     while the petrol car could rely on users and already existing workshops.
     The attractions of the early petrol car were that it could be used out
     of range and that it was amenable to a do-it-yourself maintenance
      culture. The latter was a factor in the relative decline of the electric car,
     except in some cases of centrally-controlled fleets. '°
      The Model T Ford, in production from 1908 to the late 1920s, easily
     out-produced all other cars in its time, and provides some particularly
      stark examples of the significance of maintenance. A key feature of
     the car was that it was made from interchangeable parts. This allowed
     the assembly to be carried out without fitters, and it also had implica-
     tions for maintenance. Henry Ford himself noted that the Model T
     was designed for ease of maintenance; no special skill was required
      for repair or replacement:
       I believed then, although I said very little about it because of the novelty
       of the idea that it ought to be possible to have parts so simple and so
       inexpensive that the menace of expensive hand repair work would be
       entirely eliminated. The parts could be made so cheaply that it would
       be less expensive to buy new ones than to have old ones repaired. They
       could be carried in hardware shops just as nails or bolts are carried.'®
     In an elegy for the Model T published in the 1930s, E. B. White noted
     something which escapes most factory-based images of the Model T.
     The American writer’s essay was full of references to witch doctors,
     superstition and horses, pointing to a world of use and maintenance
     of the Model T very different from that of the factory. According to
     White ‘a Ford was born as naked as a baby, and a flourishing industry

  grew up of correcting its rare deficiencies and combatting its fascinat-
  ing diseases.’'” So concerned were Ford with maintenance and repair
  that they investigated and standardised repair procedures, which
  were incorporated in a huge manual published in 1925. They also set
  standard rates for their dealers, forced them to purchase standardised
  equipment for repair and encouraged division of labour in repair
  shops. However, this plan did not work — it could not cope with the
  many vicissitudes and uncertainties of the car-repair business. The
  Fordisation of maintenance and repair, even of the Model T, did not
  work."* As the British naval officer in charge of ship construction and
  maintenance in the 1920s put it: ‘repair work has no connection with
  mass-production.”
   Car maintenance is a feature of every place where there are cars,
  but in some places and contexts it became particularly significant
  and interesting. In the west African state of Ghana, there were by the
  early 1970s a large number of motor-vehicle repair men, called ‘fitters.
  They concentrated in particular areas, sometimes called ‘magazines’,
  working from shacks or in the open air. The largest was the Suame
  Magazine, which in 1971 had nearly 6,000 people working in it. Most
  of them were directly involved in car repair, while others sold parts,
  supplied the magazine itself with food and so on. There was such
  enormous growth in the magazine that by the mid-1980s the pop-
  ulation had increased to around 40,000 and it became a centre for
  making things of all sorts. The tools used in this vast complex were
  rudimentary — there were hammers, spanners in incomplete sets, files
  and screwdrivers. Adjustable spanners did not last long; anvils were
  improvised.” The number of machine tools in this vast complex was
  in single figures.*1 The most elaborate tool in common use was the
  electric welding kit, which would be central to the manufacturing side
  of the magazine.
   How could such a place maintain and repair the products of an
  industry which was all interchangeable parts, precision engineering
  and elaborate maintenance manuals? The answer is that in some sense
  it did not — these magazines [could ] [not ] [maintain ] [such ] [cars, ] [lorries ]

     and buses so that they remained as they had been when made. There
     was a mismatch between the car or truck as new and the support
     infrastructure available. New, imported motor vehicles were degraded
     by accidents, shortages of lubricants and, importantly, lack of main-
     tenance. Then something remarkable happened: in the words of
      a knowledgeable student of these matters, ‘as time goes by and the
     vehicle is reworked in the local system, it reaches a state of apparent
     equilibrium in which it seems to be maintained indefinitely ... it is a
     condition of maintenance by constant repair.”’ There was almost daily
     repair to the local buses and trucks, which provided extremely cheap
     transport. One reason is that these transports were eternal in their
     equilibrium position. No one would think of replacing one, since they
      lived in constant interaction with a workshop.” Here the economics
     of investment and depreciation simply did not apply — the costs were
     those of maintenance and repair.
      Ghanaian car repairers developed an intimate knowledge of cars
     and engines and how to keep them going using local materials. In the
     process they transformed cars. They got to know them much more
     intimately than any rich-country user, or even a repairman. This is
      clear in the ‘biography’ written by two anthropologists, of a Peugeot
      504 used as a long-distance taxi in Ghana in the 1990s, by a driver
     named Kwaku. Maintenance and repair were in Kwaku’s mind from
     the moment he bought his car, for he purchased a second 504 body,
     and later a second engine, to be used as sources of spares. In its life
     Kwaku's car broke down repeatedly and went through a process of
     rebuilding, rewiring and acquiring a new carburettor to consume
      less petrol. Replacement gaskets were made from old tyres, fuses were
     replaced by copper wire, nails were used as lock-pins. The car ran for
     years. As its biographers put it, the ‘widespread “tropicalisation” of
     motor cars in Ghana (as well as in many other African countries) not
     only rests on a thorough knowledge of how engines work, but also
     and especially on a rather unique type of knowledge of how one can
     keep old ones working in a situation of limited goods.”* What might
     seem like dangerous and costly indifference to the rules set out in

  maintenance manuals was a remarkable example of extreme technical
   artifice brought within human understanding. This was a particular
  form of the creolisation of technology.
  Maintenance and large-scale industry
  Increasingly automated motor-car producing plants in the rich world
  needed extraordinary amounts of maintenance to keep working. Indeed
  maintenance needs severely constrained the development of automa-
  tion. A particularly good example is the use of transfer machines in
  the 1950s. In classical mass production parts were transferred between
  machines, by hand or by conveyors. Attempts were made, some suc-
  cessful, to develop machines that would take a piece of work from one
  machine and transfer it to another, where it would be worked, and so
  on from machine to machine. It was not an assembly line, both because
   it did not involve assembly and because the machine brought work not
   to the worker, but to various parts of the machine. These machines,
   called transfer machines, were at the heart of 1950s ‘automation in the
  motor industry. Indeed there was an automation scare — there were
  visions of jobs disappearing into factories without humans.
   Transfer machines had been experimented with in the car-engine
  industry in the 1920s, but they came back in the USA aero-engine
  industry during the Second World War. Transfer machines were given
   a particular boost by a new machine built to make part of the Wright-
  Cyclone aero-engine during the war, reducing the direct labour for
  making cylinder heads from fifty-nine to eight man-minutes. After
  the war, there was a boom in installation of transfer machines in the
  US car-engine industry. Particularly noteworthy was the new Ford
  engine plant in Cleveland built to produce around 1.5 million engines
  per annum. It was, some commented, a single giant transfer machine,
  since its transfer machines were themselves linked by automatic
  handling equipment.
   But ‘Detroit automation’, as the large-scale use of transfer machines
  was called, required rapid and effective maintenance of the whole
  system and easy replacement [of ] [tools ] [on ] [each ] [machine ] [tool. ] [For, ]

```
     if any part of the whole complex of machines interconnected by
     the transfer machine was not working, the whole machine had to
     be stopped. ‘Downtime’ remained a major problem, even with pro-
    grammed maintenance. These transfer machines demanded not
     only a lot of maintenance but particularly strict surveillance over
     the plant and the maintainers. At Ford’s Cleveland engine plant, a
     ‘police force’ was created to clean and maintain it, a process that
     required accurate and extensive record keeping. In order to make
     transfer machines work, the amount of maintenance labour had to
     increase radically, greatly reducing the saving achieved by reducing
     direct labour. Sometimes, the cost of the additional maintenance
     labour was greater than the savings in direct labour. To a significant
     extent the transfer machine did not eliminate labour, but transferred
     it from production to maintenance, away from the tedious work of
    manning machines to the skilled and more varied work of mainte-
     nance. Yet maintenance was so big a problem that machines were
     disconnected, to return to some of the flexibility of the pre-transfer
    machine era. In any case the promise of the machines was somewhat
     dented by the horsepower race in engine size, which demanded new
     plant for ever increasing size of engines. The lines had to be made
    more flexible than anticipated.”
      In the history of industries one gets other glimpses of the significance
     of maintenance and repair. Maintenance costs were an important part
     both of running and capital costs of railways, accounting for about
     four times the initial purchase cost of trains.”° In railways, as in cars,
     repair and maintenance are not so easily rationalized as new produc-
     tion of new locomotives, since ‘the repair activity in railway works is
    more complex than the production of new vehicles?”” There were lots
     of types to deal with, and one did not know how much work each
    would take. Already in the interwar years, standardisation of types
    and rationalisation of repair reduced repair times a great deal. At its
    Crewe workshops the LMS railway built repair lines which operated
     at different speeds depending on the size of the repair. Yet as the com-
     plexity of locomotives grew, so did the time taken for maintenance

  and repair. It took twice as long to repair the new diesel locomotives
  of the 1960s as the steam locomotives they replaced.*®* However, the
  amount of repair and maintenance needed by the new diesels was
  much lower, and the reduced maintenance and repair bill was an
  important point in their favour. Yet railway maintenance continued
  to be very important, if unglamorous. Following the privatisation
  of British railways in the 1990s, existing maintenance regimes were
  disrupted, with the consequence that essential maintenance proce-
  dures were no longer followed, resulting in serious accidents.
  Aviation
  Although the aeroplane was often associated with freedom, its
  operation was characterised by exceptional attention to discipline,
  routine and maintenance. Thus the airport was generally a highly
  organised and disciplined environment (for passengers) in the way
  a railway station was not. Aircraft which cease to work fall out of the
  sky, while cars or ships or locomotives can break down without such
  dire consequences. Therefore airlines and air forces devote a huge
  proportion of their resources to maintenance. Promoting the image
  of flying as safe was vital. It had an important consequence for an
  otherwise predominantly male industry (not least because of its con-
  nection to the military). In the interwar years the ‘aviatrix’ was a staple
  of the newspapers. These women flyers, who engaged in all sorts of
  long-distance flights, became national heroines, supported by the
  aircraft industry, because they showed that aviation was safe. In most
  countries ‘air stewards’ attended to passengers in flight, yet in the USA,
  air stewardesses or ‘air hostesses’ took to the air from the early 1930s,
  setting what was going to be the dominant pattern after the war.
   Maintenance was expensive. For example, US domestic airlines,
  from the 1930s into the 1960s, had a ground-based mechanic for
  every two flight crew members (including air hostesses).”” Mainte-
  nance accounted for 20 per cent of total costs of airline operation
  in America in the early 1960s, compared with 27 per cent for crew
  and fuel costs, 10 per cent for depreciation and 43 per cent for all

    ground costs. Maintenance took up 35 per cent of flying costs.*° It was
    around 25 per cent of flying costs, including depreciation, for the Ford
    Trimotor in the late 1920s, 20 per cent for a DC-8 jet in the early 1960s
    and around 30 per cent for a piston-engined DC-6 in 1961.”
      In the 1920s one of the major advances in the economics of aviation
    was the decreased need to maintain engines. Between 1920 and 1936
     costs fell by about 80 per cent, and represented the main cost saving
    in engine operation.” A good measure of maintenance cost was the
    time an engine could safely operate before being overhauled, the
    ‘time between overhaul’ (TBO). In the early 1920s engines in airline
    service were operating at around fifty hours between overhaul; by
     late 1920s engines were achieving up to 150 hours, and 1930s’ engines
    around 500 hours. These were the figures for new engines; once they
    were in service for two to three years the intervals increased as people
    got used to them, typically doubling or trebling. Thus the widely
    used Bristol Jupiter engine was rated at 150 hours when introduced
     in 1929, but was up to 500 hours in 1932. The Pratt & Whitney Twin
    Wasp of 1936, which powered the DC-3, was going for 1,500 hours
    by the late 1950s. The new large piston engines introduced during
    and after the Second World War started life with TBOs of around
    600-800 hours, by the late 1950s these engines were being rated at
    well over 1,000 hours, with the best, the Pratt & Whitney Double
    Wasp reaching 3,000 hours. Airlines could count on 2,000—2,500 for
    their best large engines.
     The early jet engines, despite their seeming simplicity compared to
    the mammoth piston engines of the time, at first needed even more
    maintenance. The important US military engine, the General Electric
     J-47, achieved fifty hours on launch in the early 1950s, though this
    improved to 650 hours by the mid-1950s. When the first jet engines
    were routinely used in civil airliners in the late 1950s and early 1960s,
    the TBO was set at the same level as for piston engines (2,000-2,500
    hours), but as confidence increased the time was stretched to 8,000
    hours.** The jet engine became, through intensive effort, a very reliable
    machine. Today TBOs can be as high as 50,000 hours. “4

      13. The 0.5 inch guns of a Republic F-24 Thunderjet fighter-bomber are tested by
       its maintenance crew in Korea, 1952. Air forces have typically had many more
               maintenance personnel than pilots.
    This dramatic fall in engine maintenance has taken place for very
   interesting reasons. First, it was due to improvements in the design of
   engines to make them much more inherently reliable. For example,
   through reduction in numbers of moving parts, and by using harder-
   wearing materials. But costs of engine maintenance fell dramatically
   with length of service of a particular engine type. Typically, there is
   at first a slight rise (because of unanticipated problems) and then a
    fall over ten years to 30 per cent of the original maintenance cost.
   This is due to increasing confidence in the engine itself and increas-
   ing knowledge of what needs maintenance. In other words, the
   maintenance schemes, programmes and costs are not programma-
   ble in advance. In these complex [systems ] [a ] [great ] [infrastructure ] [of ]

    documentation, control and surveillance is needed, and yet informal,
    tacit knowledge remains extremely important. People and organisa-
    tions ‘learn by using’ or ‘learn by doing.
     Learning by doing was noticed first not in aircraft maintenance,
    but in aircraft manufacture, and as long ago as the 1930s. The effect
    is this: the greater quantity of a good produced, the lower the costs
    of production. This is the origin of the expression ‘going down the
    learning curve’. This was not the result of conventional economies
    of scale, spreading of overheads or the mechanisation of methods of
    production. It applied to a given system of production and a given
    level of managerial and worker skills. The effect was significant: if
    output doubled, then costs per aircraft fell by about 20 per cent.
    Thus the hundredth aircraft produced — of a given type — was 20
    per cent cheaper than the fiftieth. The effects are large enough to
    give much-produced aircraft a distinct cost advantage. For example,
    in the early 1960s it was 5-15 per cent more expensive to produce the
   hundredth aircraft in the USA than it was in Britain. But because
    the number of aircraft made of a given type was higher, America
    was able to move down the learning curve, with the result that
    average costs of production were actually 10-20 per cent lower
    there. This calculation ignored the further beneficial effect to the
   USA of the fact that a longer production run meant R&D costs were
    spread over more aircraft.*
     This effect occurs because managers and workers learn, typically
    in an informal way, how to make or maintain the aircraft more
    easily. Extreme dependence on the reliable operation of machinery
    involved significant costs, and coping with complexities which
    seemed to dwarf formal human understanding. But humans learn to
    cope, and reduce the costs of maintenance. The best way of making
    or maintaining a particular aircraft was not known or calculable at
    the beginning because of the complexity of the aeroplane; it had to
    be learned. People were building and maintaining something they
    had designed which was more complex than they could formally
    understand. But they learned by experience how to build and

   maintain significantly more efficiently than could be programmed
   in advance.
   The battleships and bombers
   Sailing ships were very maintenance intensive. The crew were not there
   just to sail the vessel but to keep it in being. Sail-makers and carpen-
    ters formed part of a crew that was constantly patching and repairing,
   and indeed pumping out the water that streamed into even the best-
   kept hull. Ships of steel and steam were less maintenance intensive,
    at least while at sea, but even today maintenance and repair are still
   carried out at sea. As ships get older they need and get bigger crews to
   deal with the increased maintenance load. Warships and bombers too,
   were very maintenance intensive.
    Peacetime armed forces are usefully thought of as maintenance
   and training organisations. After the Second World War some hugely
   complex systems required extraordinary amounts of maintenance —
   some aircraft were dubbed ‘hangar queens. But maintenance intensity
   was not new. The Royal Navy, the great navy of the first decades of
   the twentieth century, had a global system of dockyards for mainte-
   nance and repair of ships in, for example, Malta, Gibraltar and later
   Singapore. Even in peacetime these dockyards employed thousands of
   workers, and significant proportions of the fleet were in dock at any
   one time. The practice before the mid-1920s was that warships were
   refitted for two months or so every year, in one of the royal dockyards.
   This was changed in the late 1920s so that ships’ crews maintained
   ships for two and a half years; after that the crews refitted the ships
   for two months, with dockyard assistance. This programme of ‘self-
   maintenance’ and ‘self-refit,, required more skilled seamen, but ‘many
   thousand dockyard men were discharged.’* In Malta, under the new
   scheme, November and December were devoted to ‘self-refit, when the
   ‘main engine, auxiliary engines, capstan and steering engines, boilers,
   gun-mountings, dynamos, etc’ were stripped down and refitted, where
   possible by the ship’s own technical [staff. ] [At ] [the ] [same ] [time ] [the ] [ship ]
   was ‘scraped and painted’.” Over [longer ] [periods, ] [around ] [seven ] [years ]

```

-----

```
    for a cruiser and ten years for a battleship, a longer refit of around
    one year was needed to re-tube boilers and re-wire (as well as make
    other changes deemed desirable), giving planned lives of twenty and
    twenty-seven years respectively.”*
     A ship was not necessarily a stable entity. Ships were often radically
    changed, often more than once, in the course of their lives. The
    modern battleship provides some fascinating cases of long-lived,
    long-maintained and much-changed machines. The first modern-
    pattern battleship, the Dreadnought, was launched in a royal dockyard
     in 1905. By 1914 the numbers already built or under construction were
    astounding: twenty for Britain, fifteen for Germany, ten for the USA,
    four for Russia, four for France, three each for Italy, Austro-Hungary
    and Spain, two each for Japan, Turkey (none of which was delivered),
    Chile (only one delivered, after war), Argentina and Brazil. Building
    continued through the war and beyond, but from 1922 to 1936 there
    was a moratorium (with a few exceptions) on new construction, as
    part of a process of multi-lateral naval disarmament. As a result most
    of the battleships of the three great naval powers used in the Second
    World War were built in the decade 1911-1921 so that by 1945 nearly
    half the world’s battleships were over thirty years old.
     The South American states already had a long tradition of keeping
    warships going for extraordinary periods. Argentina’s two pre-First
    World War US-built dreadnoughts, were used into the 1950s, as were
    the two British-built battleships of Brazil’s Navy, the Minas Gerais
    and the Sdo Paulo, and the single Chilean one, the Almirante Latorre.
    Perhaps the most astonishing case was the Turkish battleship Yavuz,
    which had been given to the Ottoman Empire by Germany in 1914 and
    served the remainder of its life with the Turkish Navy, being broken
    up only in 1971.
     But few, if any, were as they had been when completed. They were
    not only maintained and repaired, but they were also refitted and
    reconstructed. The Japanese Navy reconstructed nearly all its interwar
    battleships, and they changed shape and engine power particularly
    dramatically. In the British case a nice example is provided by some

    14. The Brazilian dreadnought battleship Minas Gerais, ready for maintenance and
    repair work in a floating dock Affonso Penna, Rio de Janeiro, in 1910. Battleships,
    like all warships, required very regular maintenance. Brazil had to buy not only the
    battleship but also the floating dock from Britain. Minas Gerais was reconstructed in
                 the 1930s and scrapped in the 1950s.
   of the five Queen Elizabeth class battleships which were launched in
   Britain between October 1913 (the Queen Elizabeth itself) and March
   1915. All except Barham, sunk by a U-boat in November 1941, survived
   two world wars, to be broken up in the late 1940s. What a Queen
   Elizabeth battleship was and looked like in 1918 was pretty clear, but
  by 1939 they were different ships. Between 1924 and 1934 they were
   given substantial refits, a process which included trunking the funnels
   into one, and fitting huge anti-torpedo bulges on their sides, as well
   as changes in the smaller armament. Then, in the 1930s, all except
  Barham and Malaya were ‘reconstructed, which meant that they
   were given new engines, major changes were made to the guns and
  mountings, and much of the superstructure [was ] [rebuilt. ] [In ][the ][Second ]

    World War the Queen Elizabeth would have had a decisive advantage
     in combat against Barham. Reconstruction cost about half the price of
     a new battleship. However, it took longer than expected: it was harder
     to predict how long it would take to reconstruct, in comparison with
    building from scratch.
     Most battleships were scrapped quite soon after the Second World
    War, but the US kept four Iowa class battleships, designed in the late
      19308, 1n reserve, meaning they were kept on a care and maintenance
     basis. They were put back into service in the 1960s and the 1980s and
     again in the early 1990s. The USS New Jersey was briefly recommis-
     sioned in the Vietnam war, when it bombarded the land with 3,000
     16-inch shells. All four were recommissioned by President Ronald
    Reagan in the 1980s and became platforms for launching cruise
     missiles. USS Wisconsin also fired 300 tons of 16-inch shells during
     the 1991 Gulf war. Not since the early nineteenth century had ships
     this old been in action.
      The Falklands war of 1982, immortalised by Jorge Luis Borges as
     ‘two bald men fighting over a comb; certainly involved some balding
    equipment. In 1951 Argentina acquired two Brooklyn class cruisers
     which had entered into service with the US Navy in 1939. One, the
    former USS Phoenix, was renamed 17 of October, a key date in the rise
     of General Peron, the Argentine President. The ship took part in the
    coup of 1955 which toppled Perén and was renamed the Belgrano. In
     1982 she was sunk by a British submarine as she sailed away from the
     Falklands with 21-inch Mk8 torpedoes, a type that had been in service
     in the Royal Navy for longer than the life of the Belgrano. The Belgrano
     and the torpedoes which took her to the bottom were not the only
     veterans. Britain bombed an airstrip on the Falklands with a 1950s-
     built Vulcan bomber, which was refuelled in the air by a converted
     1950s bomber of another type, the Victor.” Argentina’s one aircraft
     carrier, the Veinticinco de Mayo, was appropriately enough the former
    HMS Venerable, a Colossus class British carrier built in 1945. She was
     sold to the Dutch in 1948, and on to Argentina in 1969. Taken out of
     service in 1986, she appears to have been scrapped in India around

   2000, though there had been plans to modernise her. Another ship
   of the class, the former HMS Vengeance, was still in service in 2001 as
    Brazil’s Minas Gerais. She was broken up on Alang beach in Gujarat in
   2004 (see plate 27 on p. 208). Another British wartime carrier, HMS
   Hercules, of a very similar class, went to India and became the INS
    Vikrant, decommissioned only in 1997.”°
     Similar stories can be told about aircraft of the nuclear age. The
   B-52 bomber, one of the first, and certainly the most produced nuclear
   bomber, had a particularly extraordinary record. It first flew in 1952, and
   was last manufactured in 1962. Not only is it still in use, it is expected to
   continue in service to 2040 though, of course, much changed. Stories
    are told of grandchildren of early B-52 pilots now flying them. Another
   example is the KC-135, an air-refuelling tanker, which was manufactured
   between 1956 and 1966. More than 600 of the 732 tankers built were
    still in service in the mid-1990s. At the end of the twentieth century,
   with new engines and many other modifications, they remain the main
   refuelling aircraft of the US Air Force. Odd as it may seem, the KC-135,
   ordered by the US Air Force, was turned by its maker, Boeing, into the
   much more famous 707 passenger jet, which is long out of service.
    More prosaic things than battleships and bombers have been kept in
    use for long periods by constant maintenance and repair. The last large
   sailing ships for commercial service were built in the 1920s, among them
   the Padua, built in Germany in 1926. She survived after the Second
   World War as a Soviet training ship, and latterly an Estonian one. The
    last big fleet of sailing ships was operated by Gustaf Erikson, flying the
   Finnish flag, mostly on the Australian grain trade. The fleet was active
    in the 1930s, and had a final spurt of life in the late 1940s with two
   ships, the Panir and Passat. The last square-rigged ship in commercial
   operation, the Omega, was engaged in carrying guano to the mainland
   of Peru between the 1920s and her sinking in 1958: she had been built in
    1887. More recent ships have also had long lives. The SS France, launched
    in 1960, was laid up in the 1970s but was then taken over, rebuilt and
   renamed Norway, becoming a huge success as a cruising ship. Indeed
   she pioneered modern cruising in specialist and large ships and

    remained in service until 2003, after a number of further important
    changes. The QE2, built in the late 1960s, is still going after major
    refits; it was given diesels instead of its original steam turbines in the
    mid-1980s, and had a big refit in the mid-1990s. In parts of the world
    some old locomotives were in use for long periods. The Shakuntala
    Express, which operates in a remote part of Maharashtra, was pulled
    by a steam engine built in Manchester in 1921, from 1923 to 1994."' In
    Uruguay one can still see on the roads a few American built motor
     cars of the 1920s; Cuba retains many US models from the 1950s, and
    extraordinary effort is made to maintain car batteries. London’s Red
    Routemaster buses — first used in 1954 and in production till 1968 —
    were withdrawn from regular service in 2005 but are still used (though
    of course refurbished and re-engined) to ferry tourists on sightseeing
    tours of London. Malta has many British buses from the 1950s and
    1960s on its roads. Many London Underground trains had lives of
    many decades, and London suburban services use rolling stock built
    in the early 1960s. A notable example was a type of underground train
    introduced in the late 1930s and not replaced until the 1970s. Even
    then, fifty-eight were given an ‘extra-heavy overhaul in the early 1970s;
    they were used to the mid-1980s on London underground, and some
    continued in service on the Isle of Wight into the 1990s. For nearly
    one hundred years an electric power station in Lots Road, Chelsea
    supplied the underground with electric power. The station opened in
    1904, got new turbo-alternators in 1908-1910, in the early 1930s and
    again in 1963. These last sets remained in use until after 2001.”
     Concorde provides another example. Having been in service for
    a quarter of a century, the Concorde fleet was grounded following a
    serious accident in July 2000. After important alterations on safety
    grounds, the fleet returned to service, with the expectation that
    it would be around for many more years. But, the reduction in air
    traffic following 9/11 2001, and the rise in the cost of spare parts, made
    operation unviable. In October 2003 the last Anglo-French Concorde
    commercial flight flew into Heathrow airport, riding a wave of
    technological nostalgia, an odd outcome for something so futuristic.

  A correspondent to a British newspaper noted: ‘Sadly, we are about to
  witness the premature death of Concorde, an aircraft whose structure
   still has no finite life”** He meant of course that, with maintenance,
   the structure could be kept going indefinitely.
    In many cases maintenance, refurbishment and overhaul have
   resulted in improvement over time. One case of particular interest
   is the improvement in efficiency of steam locomotives, the life work
   of an Argentine railway engineer, Livio Dante Porta.** He was able to
   increase the efficiency of existing steam engines, as were others using
   his ideas (for example in South Africa). Despite some investment in
  new designs for steam locomotives, prompted by the oil crisis of the
   1970s, the move towards diesel and electric traction was too powerful
   for steam to compete.
  From maintenance to manufacture and innovation
  Maintenance sometimes also means a significant remodelling as
   with battleships and bombers. Similarly, small-scale maintenance
  workshops could be and were used to change things, sometimes as
  soon as they were bought. For example, in the 1920s a Ford Model T
  buyer ‘never regarded his purchase as a complete finished product.
  When you bought a Ford you figured you had a start — a vibrant,
   spirited framework to which could be screwed an almost limitless
  assortment of decorative and functional hardware.” Many things
  could be bought by mail order, another great American invention, but
  the first thing E. B. White, the author of this recollection, did with his
  new car was to take it to a blacksmith to have brackets fitted to hold
   an army trunk. One could acquire everything from mirrors to devices
   to stop rattling. The United States itself has the most extreme forms
  of modification of cars. For some white males souped up ‘hot-rod’
   cars are a passion, for ‘chicanos’ [elaborate ] [‘low-riders’ ] [with ] [hydrau- ]
   lics to raise and lower the body [and ] [elaborate ] [internal ] [decoration ] [are ]
   a product of a culture of ‘customisation’ [of ][cars ] [dating ] [certainly ] [to ]

     from Mexico to Afghanistan to the Philippines. Surely nothing would
     have horrified Ford more.
      There are many examples in the history of twentieth-century
    technology where enterprises started by maintaining a technol-
     ogy, moved on to manufacture components or the whole thing, and
     then to innovate. But equally there are others where maintenance
     did not lead to such a development. The case of railway locomotives
     is particularly interesting because the facilities needed to maintain
     and manufacture steam locomotives were essentially the same. Thus
     British railway workshops not only maintained but made engines.
     Since steam locomotives required intensive maintenance and repair,
    everywhere they operated they needed significant industrial facilities.
     In India, for example, a whole network of maintenance workshops
     had to be established. But, the Indian railway workshops did not, on
     the whole, develop manufacture, in order to reserve orders for British-
     based firms. Indeed, before the Second World War Indian engineering
     was largely concerned with maintenance.
     A very different case is the Japanese bicycle industry. Bicycle pro-
     duction started in the repair shops for imported (largely British)
     bicycles. First replacement parts were made for imported cycles, then
     these parts were assembled into complete cheaper bicycles. Bicycles
     were made by a system of small-scale parts makers and small-scale
     assemblers, as well as some bigger integrated operations. In the 1920s
     the industry started exporting and by the 1930s exports accounted
     for half of all production. Exports went to China and South East
     Asia and were overwhelmingly of replacement parts (90 per cent) for
    British-made bicycles.” South East Asia was awash with semi-British,
     semi-Japanese bicycles, and indeed entirely Japanese copies of British
     bicycles. This extraordinary success, due to a flair for copying and the
     existence of vast numbers of small firms, is echoed down to the recent
     past, when Japanese firms still dominated the production of high-
     quality bicycle parts.
     Another industry Japan found great success in, this time after the
    Second World War, also came out of repair workshops. In the radio

```

```
  industry in the early years after the war a majority of radio sets were
  made by small enterprises which were not subject to tax. These busi-
   nesses were repair organisations at a time when repair and replacement
  of parts in radio sets was very common. Televisions were produced in
   kit form in the 1950s and often assembled by these repair shops. This
   close relationship, not wholly unique to Japan, was critical in estab-
  lishing close links between producers and users.** Out of this came a
  new electronics industry after the Second World War.”
    In some cases temporary shortages of imports led to repair organisa-
   tions branching out into manufacture and even design. This happened
   in many countries during the Second World War, as industrial capacity
  was developed by imperial powers to produce armaments, and because
  many countries could no longer buy manufactures. For example, the
  Indian railway workshops started making armaments and that great
   Parsi enterprise, Tata Iron and Steel, greatly expanded its operations.”
   In South Africa, Australia, Argentina and many other places, the war
   led to great expansion in domestic production, often out of repair and
  maintenance facilities. There were notable cases after the war too. In
  Ghana the ‘magazines’ developed into centres for making things of all
   sorts at a time of severe shortage of imports from the 1970s. Among
   these products are two standard types of vehicle bodies made of wood
  —the ‘trotro’ or ‘mammie wagon passenger vehicle, based on a Bedford
  truck chassis, and the ‘cocoa-truck transport, based ona bigger chassis.”!
  A nice example of a maintenance organisation turning to manufac-
   ture and innovation concerns the giant electric supply company for
  Sao Paulo in Brazil, the Companhia Energética de Sao Paulo, one of
   the largest such enterprises in [Latin ] [America. ] [The ] [electronics ] [mainte- ]
  nance division was faced with [an ] [enormous ] [problem ] [in ][the ] [1980s ] [and ]
   19908 as economic crises led [to ] [restrictions ] [on ] [imports ] [of ][the ][parts ] [and ]

    Engineers and the maintenance of society
    Although we separate people from things very readily, things cannot
     exist without maintenance. This imposes a particularly intimate
     relation with things, which goes well beyond use. To be able to
     maintain and repair involves different and often greater skills from
     operating (there are obvious counter-examples, for example the case
     of a concert pianist and a piano tuner). Few could maintain and repair
     things. The maintenance man is, however, widespread enough to be
     instantly recognised as one of the most common forms of technical
     expert. So much so that professional engineers in the USA and Britain
     resent the use of ‘engineer’ for such lowly figures as the TV repairman.
     Neither do professional engineers relish the association made between
     the engineer, the oily rag and the spanner, tools of the maintenance
     man. Professional engineering, they rightly insist, is something else.
     In recent time engineers have stressed their role in innovation, design
     and creation of new things. Engineers, in this view, are concerned
     above all with the future; they are optimistic and progressive; they
     send new things out into the world.
      The image of the professional engineer as creator and reformer is
      as misleading as the conflation between him and the lowly repairman.
    Only a small minority of engineers are concerned with design and
     development, even among the most academically trained. A survey of
     professional Swedish engineers of 1980 noted that 72 per cent of them
    worked on the maintenance and supervision of existing things.» If
     most doctors and dentists maintain and repair human bodies, then
     similarly engineers are concerned with keeping things going, with
     diagnosis and repair of faults, as well as operations. It is little wonder
     that as the number of things to be kept going has increased, so has
     the number of professional engineers. Men who know about ships,
     buildings, machines, roads, canals, motor cars, have been needed
    more and more. Their number has increased much more than the
     population, and much more than the number of doctors, dentists and
     lawyers. In the United States today there are over 2 million engineers,
     double the number of either doctors or lawyers.

    The extraordinary masculinity of engineering is related closely to
   what engineers do, not what they know. Expertise in things, whether
   in the home, or industry or in the fields has been deemed a masculine
   activity. Thus maintenance and repair have been an almost wholly
   masculine activity. It is the one domestic task at which men in rich
   countries devote more time than do women. There was one great
   exception to these trends and levels in the twentieth century, the Soviet
   Union, where it seems that a majority of engineers were women (as
   were the doctors). This hardly went unnoticed in the capitalist world,
   as can be seen from the comedy film Ninotchka (1939), directed by
   Ernst Lubitsch and written by Billy Wilder. Greta Garbo is Ninotchka,
    a dour Soviet engineer on a mission to Paris, where she is interested in
   the Eiffel Tower only from a technical point of view. She is converted
   to love, luxury and femininity by the class enemy, a French aristo-
   crat, and does not, of course, go on to a career in engineering under
   capitalism.
    That engineering is not primarily about creation and invention is
   also attested to by the case of state engineers. These men are concerned
   with the administration of state technologies. The model case is France
   with its tiny centralised elite corps of state engineers, though it has
   been replicated in Spain, Greece, Mexico and elsewhere. Among them
   were the state energy corps (corps des mines) or the state transport
   corps (corps des ponts et chaussées), and the many other lower-ranking
   technical and non-technical corps of the higher administration of the
   French state. First trained at the Ecole Polytechnique and then at the
   specialist schools for each corps — for example the Ecole des Mines
   and the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées — these men were the dukes and
   barons of the state nobility. Under the fifth French Republic (1958-)

    was lost in the new world of the depression. Engineers were to be
    found on the Soviet politburo in the 1970s and 1980s: among them
    were Leonid Brezhnev and Boris Yeltsin. In 2005 all the members of
    the Chinese politburo were engineers.

            Nations
  The celebration of the inventive citizen has been an important part of
  modern nationalism. This invention-chauvinism is, like nationalism,
   a global phenomenon. Curators of national traditions overestimated
  the significance of inventors that shared their particular nationality,
  overemphasised national connections, and made too much of the sig-
  nificance of making things first. ‘No we do not have pasteurized milk
   in France, but we do have Pasteur’, said a Frenchman to an American
   in the 1960s.' Juan de la Cierva (1895-1936) is regarded as one of the
  greatest Spanish inventors, but although he invented and developed
  the autogiro (a flying machine with rotating wings, a little like a
  helicopter) in Spain, he set up an enterprise in Britain. Or consider
  Ladislao José Biro (1899-1985), ‘without doubt the most important
  Argentine inventor there has been.’ But the context for his invention
  of the ballpoint pen, or biro, was the increasingly anti-semitic Hungary
  from which Laszl6 Jozsef Bird emigrated in 1938. Famously, in its most
  nationalist phase, the Soviet Union was able to find Russian inventors
  for many important technologies, thus Alexander Stepanovitch Popov
  (1859-1906) invented radio.
    In Britain, France and the United States people laughed too easily
   at what they saw as techno-nationalist excesses in other countries. For

     great technological and scientific museums of the rich world, such as
     the Science Museum in London, the Deutsches Museum in Munich
     and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, are not replicas of
     each other, or complements, but in some senses competitors too. As
     a result of this emphasis on national inventiveness, the relations of
     nations and technology are particularly prone to being discussed in
     terms of invention and innovation.
      Techno-nationalism takes other forms too, for example in claims
     that this or that country is best fitted for the technological age. The
     creation of new national identities suited for a technological age was
    happening around the world. There was hardly a nation that did not
     have intellectuals who thought his or her nation was best fitted for the
     ‘air age. Interwar French writers argued that as a vital and aesthetic
     people the French were particularly suited to be aviators.’ Hitler
    thought war in the air was a particularly Germanic form of battle.* Sir
     Walter Raleigh, Professor of English at Oxford and official historian of
     the Great War in the air, claimed in the 1920s that Britain ‘had a body
     of youth fitted by temperament for the work of the air, and educated,
     as if by design, to take risks with a light heart — the boys of the Public
     Schools of England’° Soviet record-breaking pilots, dubbed ‘Stalin’s
     falcons, were closely associated with the “New Mar’ and with Stalin
     himself.° The Russian-born aircraft manufacturer and propagandist
    Alexander de Seversky claimed that ‘Americans are the natural masters
     of the aerial weapon ... more than any other people Americans are
     the natural children of the machine age’; ‘Air power is the American
    weapon.” Yet the inverse problem is just as significant: the attribution
     to another nation of extraordinary technological powers which elude
     one’s own. For example, the feeling in Britain that Germany, then the
     United States and the Soviet Union, and latterly Japan, does technol-
     ogy better, and that there is always one country which does it best.
    Thus Lindberg’s transatlantic flight of 1927 was hailed in Europe as
     well as America as evidence of the vigour of the New World.’ Com-
    munists everywhere saw in ‘Stalin’s falcons’ evidence of the superior-
     ity of Soviet society.’ Fascists, and indeed some anti-fascists, saw Nazi

  Germany and Italy as the nations best fitted to aviation. More recently
   Japan was widely regarded as the nation most suited to the electronic
   age. Individually such claims might seem credible, and have mislead
  many into thinking too nationalistically about technology, but col-
   lectively they contradict each other.
    Techno-nationalism assumes that the key unit of analysis for the
   study of technology is the nation: nations are the units that invent,
   that have R&D budgets, cultures of innovation, that diffuse, that use
   technology. The success of nations, it is believed by techno-national-
   ists, is dependent on how well they do this. This techno-nationalism
   is implicit, not only in any number of national histories of technol-
   ogy, but also in many policy studies, for example of ‘national systems
   of innovation’ Particular technologies are associated with particular
   nations. Cotton textiles and steam power are seen as British, chemicals
   as German, mass production as American, consumer electronics as
   Japanese.'° This is despite the fact that all these countries were strong
   in all these technologies.
    On the other hand, we have techno-globalism, particularly focused
   on communications technologies, which endlessly repeats the idea
   that the world is becoming a ‘global village’. In this old-fashioned
   view nations are always about to disappear through the advance of
   globalising new technology. The steam ship, the aeroplane, the radio,
   and more recently television and the internet, it is argued, are forging
   a new global world economy and culture, and the nation is at best
   a temporary vehicle through which the forces of techno-globalism
   operate.
    Nations are important in ways techno-nationalism cannot capture,
   and the international and global dimension is crucial in ways which
   techno-globalism is ignorant of. In any case, politics, multinational
   firms, empire and race were also crucial factors in shaping the use of
   technology which cut across the national and global divide in complex
   and changing ways. The nation and the state are central to the history
   of twentieth-century technology, [but ] [not ] [in ][the ][ways ] [the ] [relations ] [are ]
   usually understood.

    Techno-nationalism
    Nationalism, that great hidden ideology of the twentieth century,
    has been thought of as a deviant notion compared to more accept-
     able, and seemingly less ideological, liberal and internationalist ideas.
    Nationalism is seen as an ideological throwback — like militarism and
    linked to it — a stirring up of supposedly ancient bonds of blood. It
     is a dangerous blast from the past. Not surprisingly, the linking of
    nationalism and technology has not been looked on favourably. Thus
    the term techno-nationalism is used by Western analysts primarily in
    relation to Japan and now China, to describe a potentially, perhaps
     actually, dangerous thing.
     To suggest that techno-nationalism applies only to such countries
    would be a great mistake. Intellectuals were very nationalistic about
    science and technology, particularly in mid twentieth century, in
    nearly every nation. Indeed nationalism is not only present but very
    similar in many different nations. Every country had it, at much the
    same time and in much the same way, even though its central claim
    was for the uniqueness of each nation. One reason for this is suggested
    by Ernest Gellner’s account of nationalism. For Gellner, nationalism
    was a way of adapting to a modern, industrial and globalising world.
     It was a global response to a global phenomenon. The idea is this: in
     a modern industrial society, where education, bureaucracy, informa-
    tion and communication mattered deeply, to be alienated from all
     this by linguistic and cultural barriers was intolerable. Hence these
    functions needed to be carried out in the language spoken by the
    people. Nationalism, which was something new, was thus vital to
    modernity. Nationalism in this sense is not a way of escaping from a
    globalised cosmopolitan modern world, but a means of participating
    in it while retaining one’s dignity, and indeed creating one’s capacity
     to participate.'!
    National innovation and national growth
    An implicit techno-nationalism is found in an extreme and widespread
    form in the assumption that national economic and technological

       15. A national technology. Mahatma Gandhi reading newspaper clippings
        next to a Charkha (spinning wheel), the great symbol of the Indian
      National Congress. The spinning wheel was re-introduced into India in
       the twentieth century as a result of a campaign led by Gandhi to promote
                 ‘production by the masses’.
  performance is determined by national rates of invention and inno-
   vation. It is there in the standard market failure argument, developed
   in the United States in the late 1950s, for state support of research. The
  argument was this: individuals in a society would not fund enough
   research because others could make use of the research just as much as
   the funder could. This is the famous ‘free-rider’ problem. The market
   failed, and thus government should step in to fund research, which
  would benefit everyone. Of course, states, including the US, supported
   research long before this argument was put forward, and of course
  would continue to do so for other reasons. Yet the argument worked
  only for a closed system, if each nation was insulated from every
   other one. For the free-rider problem would otherwise also apply to

    governments — why should the Indian government fund research that
    would equally be exploited by Pakistani, or US citizens? We should
    recognise of course that in the 1950s the US dominated world research
    and development, and thus could be thought of as a closed system.
     This implicit techno-nationalism is also found in another justi-
    fication for national funding of research (and development). It is
    the idea that to overtake rich countries a nation needs to invent and
    innovate more, and that if it does not it will descend to the level of
    the poorest countries. Even casting doubt on the role of national
    R&D can lead the analyst to be accused of being indifferent to their
    nation becoming like Bulgaria or Paraguay. In such arguments it is
    often first claimed that invention and innovation is of huge impor-
     tance to other nations, and then that Britain, India or, say, Thailand
    spends much less on R&D than the United States and Japan. Thus
    Spaniards complain that Spain’s share of invention has been lower
    than its share of population, and indeed production. But Spaniards
    compare themselves to the richest countries in the world, not the
    world as a whole.”
     This innovation-centric techno-nationalist understanding is
    central to national histories of technologies. Historians and others
    have assumed that Germany and America grew fast in the early years
    of the twentieth century because of rapid national innovation. They
    also argued that the British ‘decline’ (that is slow growth) must have
    been associated with low innovation, indeed this ‘decline’ was itself
    taken as evidence of poor innovation. For example, a recent book
    on innovation and economic performance, most of it arranged in
    typical fashion in chapters based on nations, expresses surprise that
     in the case of Japan recent economic performance has not been on a
    par with the country’s huge R&D spending, which is second only to
    that of the USA in scale." In the 1990s crude versions of endogenous
    growth theory, which claimed that inputs such as R&D led to growth,
    globally and nationally, flourished.
     So powerful has this innovation-centric view been, especially in
     its nationalistic versions, that all evidence to the contrary has been

   studiously ignored. It was known in the 1960s that national rates of
  economic growth did not correlate positively with national invest-
   ments in invention, research and development, or innovation. It
   has not been the case that countries that innovate a lot, grow a lot.
   Take, for example, Italy and the United Kingdom. Each was very
   different in 1900 but not so different in 2000. In the 1980s Italy
  overtook the United Kingdom in output per head, a shock the
   Italians named il sorpasso. That these countries, such opposites in
   the usual estimations of national character, had now reached the
  same level of income per head was unsettling on both sides. In the
  techno-nationalist world it was literally incredible that Italy had
  become richer than Great Britain, while spending much less on
  R&D than Britain did. Italian scientists and engineers and research
   policy experts had long complained that Italy was by no measure a
   great centre of innovation; it has very few Nobel prizes (one is for
   the polymerisation of the plastic polypropylene), and its expendi-
   ture on R&D has been low by the standards of rich countries. In
   Britain, so peculiar are the politics of technology that it has been
  claimed that Italy was spending more on R&D than Britain in
   order to square this particular circle. What one does not find is the
  acceptance that Italy has been brilliantly successful in that with little
  R&D, it has become as rich as Britain.
    It is important to stress that this is not a unique case. Spain was
   one of the most successful European economies in terms of rates of
  growth in the 1980s and 1990s, and yet this is a country which spends
   less than 1 per cent of GDP on R&D. It had much less of a histori-
   cal track record in industry and technology than Italy: it is a “sistema
   tecnoldgico que progresa sin innovar. '* The most spectacularly fast-
  growing economies in world history have been those of some Asian
   countries, such as Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea, and most recently and
   significantly of all, given its size, China. While China has transformed
   itself and flooded the world with manufactures, the much more inno-
   vative Japanese economy has been, [by ][comparison, ] [stagnant. ] [Moreover, ]
  while national R&D expenditures [have ] [increased ] [in ][the ][rich ] [countries ]

```

-----

```
     in recent decades, economic growth rates have dropped below those
     found in the long boom.
      To add further to these seeming paradoxes, the two countries which
     both grew very fast and had high and increasing R&D expenditure in
     the twentieth century, the Soviet Union and Japan, were not especially
     innovative. The Soviet case is particularly stunning. It spent 2.9 per
     cent of GNP on R&D in the late 1960s, the same as the USA, and spent
     more than America in the early 1970s. The number of Soviet scientists
     and engineers in R&D, in absolute numbers, overtook the US total
     in the very late 1960s, giving the USSR the largest R&D workforce in
     the world.’ Yet it is regarded, perhaps unfairly, as having contributed
     practically nothing novel to modern industry. Japan did better than
     the Soviet Union after the Second World War, but its record of inno-
     vation is felt, again perhaps unfairly, not to be congruent with huge
    R&D expenditures.
     How can we make sense of this? What general rules are there? Firstly,
     there is a broad rule that richer countries spend a higher proportion
     of their output on R&D than poor ones. There are exceptions to this:
     for example, Italy in recent decades was rich but spent little; the USSR,
     while very poor, spent as much or more than the richest countries.
     Secondly, the relationship does not necessarily hold over time: as rich
     countries got slowly richer in the 1980s and 1990s, the proportion
     of national income spent on R&D remained broadly static, and in
     some cases fell. There is a second general rule of thumb, again with
     important exceptions, that the fastest-growing countries are not the
     richest. The slowest-growing were already rich. The fastest-growing
     countries in the twentieth century have been poor countries, which
     spent very little on innovation. Thus taking these two general rules
     together we can conclude that rich, slow-growing countries spend a
     lot more on R&D than fast-growing poor ones.
     Why does the techno-nationalist assumption about innovation
     and growth not hold? The link between innovation and use, and thus
    economic performance, is far from straightforward. Yet the techno-
     nationalist assumption implies that the things a nation uses derive

```

```
   from its own invention and innovation, or at the very least that inno-
   vating nations have early leads in the technologies they innovate. Yet
   the site of innovation is not always the major site of even early use
   of the technology. In the case of the motor car, Germany, where the
   internal-combustion-powered motor car was invented, was not the
   main early producer of cars in the first twenty years of the industry.
   The USA became easily the dominant producer by 1914, and Germany
   remained less motorised than other rich countries for many decades.
   The powered aeroplane was innovated in the USA by the Wright
   brothers in 1903 but Britain, France and Germany had much larger
   air fleets by 1914. As we shall see, photography and television are other
   examples.
    More significantly, national use of technology is hardly dependent
   on national innovation. Most technologies are shared across national
   boundaries; nations acquire more new technology from abroad than
   they innovate themselves. Italy did not have to invent afresh the tech-
   nology it used, just as Britain did not either. Both were sharing in a
   global pool, as was every country in the world. One can make this
   clearer by looking around one’s immediate surroundings and asking
   about the origins of the things one can see; nowhere in the world would
   more than a small minority be local. Thus it is unfair to complain that
   of seventy-five major technologies in use in the Soviet Union through
  much of its history, five were of Soviet origin and ten of joint Soviet
   origin.’® One needs to specify the comparator, and to recognise that
   for most countries, even the richest and most innovative, the propor-
   tions may well have been similar.
    The concept of technological sharing is an important one. Yet its
   importance in the history of the twentieth century is obscured by
   thinking about the movement of technologies across national bound-
   aries in terms of technology transfer from technological leaders to
   others. The term was first used to describe the export of modern tech-
   nologies to poor countries. Transfer in this sense is much less sig-
   nificant than the movement of technologies between rich countries.
  The two-way movements between British and France in the twentieth

     century have been much more significant than those between Britain
    and India. This is not to deny the importance of movements across
     technological boundaries. Indeed one of the most important features
     of the twentieth-century world economy has been the convergence
     of certain countries on one technological level. The rich countries of
     the world are much closer in all economic measures than they were
     in 1900. These countries have borrowed from each other and perhaps
    most from a particular technological leader which set the highest
     level. Italy, Spain, Japan, the USSR and now China have been imitating
     foreign technologies on a huge scale, and this has been an essential
     aspect of their rapid economic growth.
      There is one very special case in this story of convergence among
     the richest nations. In the nineteenth century the USA did not catch
     up with Europe in terms of productivity, it shot ahead. Through the
     twentieth century it remained ahead, with, in the middle of the century,
     productivity levels at least twice as great as that of the European
     industrial giants. This lead did not come from dominance in ‘pure
     science’ or even ‘industrial research — in 1900 America was the leader
     in neither. Where historians have claimed to find US distinctiveness
    and a particular surge in innovation is in production technology — the
     sort of thing which led to mass production. Yet, the evidence for the
     centrality of US invention in this area is not as strong as nationalistic
     analyses of American technology would have us believe. There were
     extraordinary flows of technological know-how across the Atlantic in
     the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.'’? By mid-century
     however, the USA was a clear leader in industrial research and innova-
     tion by any standard: it dominated both world production and world
     innovation. As such it was wholly atypical, and exactly the sort of case
    where we would expect technologies to derive from national innova-
     tion. Only perhaps in the exceptional case of the United States after the
    Second World War might locally innovated products have registered
     strongly. Many studies show that US innovation promoted US growth
      — the mistake was to believe that this applied to other countries too,
    and that the rate of growth in America was particularly high.

   We may conclude, then, that global innovation may be the main
  determinant of global economic growth, but it does not follow that
   this is the case for particular nation states. Since national innovation
  has not been the main source of national technique, it should not be
   at all surprising that there is no clear positive relationship between
  national innovation and national rates of growth. Global technologi-
   cal sharing, between rich countries and between rich and poor, has
  been the norm. Should we, then, discard techno-nationalism, and
  think techno-globally?
  Techno-globalism
  While techno-nationalism has been a core assumption in much
  thinking about the nation-state and technology in the twentieth
  century, there has also been a techno-globalism which claimed the
  globe as the key unit of analysis. It often looked forward to technol-
  ogy eliminating the nation-state, which it regarded as an outmoded
  organisation. Most techno-globalism has been innovation-centric,
  and it is this kind of techno-globalism which has been at the heart
  of any number of histories of the world, the musings of information
  society gurus, and many a portentous address about science and tech-
  nology. It has been claimed that the world has been going through a
  process of globalisation as a result of the latest technologies, for well
   over a century.
    In the late nineteenth century the steam-ship, the railway and the
  telegraph reached across and into the world which was, with justifica-
   tion, seen as interconnected as never before. Yet that globalisation was
  ignored when claims for new technologies of globalisation were being
  made just a little later. Thus in the 1920s Henry Ford in My Philosophy
  of Industry claimed that
    Machinery is accomplishing in the world what man has failed to do
   by preaching, propaganda, or the written word. The aeroplane and
    wireless know no boundary. They [pass ] [over ] [the ] [dotted ] [lines ] [on ] [the ]
   map without heed or hindrance. [They ] [are ] [binding ] [the ] [world ] [together ]

       in a way no other system can. The motion picture with its universal
       language, the aeroplane with its speed, and the wireless with its
      coming international programme — these will soon bring the world to
        a complete understanding. Thus may we vision a United States of the
       World. Ultimately it will surely come!"®
     For Henry Ford, ‘The motor-car has done for the United States what
     the aeroplane and wireless may do for the world’'’ Twenty years
      later the Canadian Air Marshal and Great War air ace Billy Bishop
     claimed that ‘The horse and buggy developed purely local geographi-
      cal cultures. Railway trains and motor cars developed nationalism.’
     This begs the question, of course, when the age of the train and the
     motor car was, but in this innovation-centric account, it was passing.
     With the aeroplane came the necessity, as Bishop saw it, for ‘the
     establishment of world culture, a world view of the responsibilities
     of citizenship ... The Air Age must bring us entirely new concepts of
     citizenship, of national and international relations. The choice was
     between “Winged Peace or Winged Death.”
      H. G. Wells was one of the great propagandists for this kind of
     thinking. In the Shape of Things to Come: The Ultimate Revolution
      (1933) airmen bring peace and civilisation to a war-devastated world.”!
     Wells imagined a Conference in 1965 of scientific and technical
     workers in Basra, Iraq. It was organised by the Transport Union,
     which brought together surviving aeroplane and sea transport, and
     used as its language the Basic English of the aviators.” As a result there
     was central control of the airways, with an air force to enforce peace.
     The unit of currency was the air dollar.’ The Air and Sea Control
     and the Police of the Air and Seaways were owned by the Modern
     State Society, made up of qualified fellows. In 1978 they decided to put
     down the re-emerging national governments’ opposition with a new
     gas called Pacificin. Wells was not alone in putting forward these ideas.
     In the early 1930s there were all sorts of suggestions for the creation
     of an ‘international air police’ along these lines, and similar thinking
     continued into the 1940s, usually with the British and Americans as

```

-----

```
   that international police force. In more recent years the atomic bomb,
   television and above all the internet and the world-wide web have
   featured in this kind of techno-globalism. As we have seen, it was
   generally the older technologies which were crucial to global relations
   — today’s globalisation is in part the result of extremely cheap sea and
   air transport, and radio and wire-based communication.
    Historically aware and more knowledgeable commentators could
   not stomach this kind of stuff. In 1944 George Orwell noted the repeti-
   tiveness in the claims:
    Reading recently a batch of rather shallowly optimistic ‘progressive’
    books, I was struck by the automatic way people go on repeating
    certain phrases which were fashionable before 1914. Two great favou-
    rites are the ‘abolition of distance’ and the ‘disappearance of frontiers’ I
    do not know how often I have met with statements that ‘the aeroplane
    and the radio have abolished distance’ and ‘all parts of the world are
    now interdependent.
  But Orwell criticised not only the historical amnesia involved. He
  claimed there was a quite different relationship between technology
  and world history. ‘Actually, he claimed, ‘the effect of modern inven-
  tions has been to increase nationalism, to make travel enormously
  more difficult, to cut down the means of communication between
  one country and another, and to make various parts of the world
   less, not more dependent on one another for food and manufactured
  goods.** He was thinking about what had been happening since 1918,
  and particularly since the early 1930s. His was a powerful and defen-
   sible argument.
   The great era of global trade had ended in 1914. In the interwar
  years trade stagnated and fell, and especially in the 1930s nation-
   states all over the world became increasingly autarkic. In the middle
  of the twentieth century the world was much less globalised than it
  had previously been, and would be at the end of the century. There
  was a profound nationalisation. There was also a powerful move to

     turn political empires into trading blocs to a degree unknown before.
     Innovation-centred political history puts the great age of nationalism
     in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; the age of imperial-
     ism is placed between the 1870s and the First World War. Yet empire
     accounted for a greater proportion of trade in the 1930s, 1940s and
     1950s than it did in the pioneering days of the new imperialism.
     Nationalism was at least as important in the middle of the twentieth
     century as it had been earlier. And, as Orwell noted, science and tech-
     nology were key tools of autarky, the policy of national economic self-
     sufficiency in the 1930s and 1940s. He pointed in particular to the role
     of the aeroplane and the radio in bolstering this new and dangerous
     nationalism. In other words, the very technologies that were at the
     heart of the naive techno-globalism Vision of an interconnected world
     were the tools of a new national despotism.
     One can go much further than Orwell did in ironically inverting the
     claims of innovation-centric techno-globalist propaganda. For many
     of the technologies invoked as being somehow essentially internation-
     alising were profoundly national in origin and use. Radio, which had
     a military origin, was intimately connected to national power. The
    development of the radio before the Great War was intimately tied
     to navies — indeed the Royal Navy was the largest single customer for
     the Marconi Company, which led the world in radio. During and after
     the Great War, radio and the military remained closely connected; the
     Radio Corporation of America, for example, was closely tied to the US
     state.”
      More stunningly still, the aeroplane was primarily a weapon of war,
     even in peacetime. Far from threatening to transcend the nation, it
     was the product of a system of competing nation-states and empires.
     In peace as in war, the aircraft industry was utterly dependent on the
     patronage of the military. In peacetime some three-quarters of the
     output of all the main aircraft industries in the world went to the
     military. In the interwar years air forces had hundreds of aircraft,
     airlines tens. Since then, too, the military continue to dominate
     aircraft industry sales. Yet, to this day histories of technology treat

   aviation under transportation; histories of aviation are really histories
  of civil aviation, and technical development is seen as driven by civil
  transportation needs. Histories of the aircraft-producing industry
   also overemphasise the significance of the production of civil aircraft;
  accounts of the industry in peacetime are accounts of the production
  of civil aircraft.”
    But radio and the aeroplane were not the only cases. The atomic
  bomb was also the product of a world of competing states. So too was
  the internet, born of US military needs and funding. Many other great
  technologies of the twentieth century were technologies of autarky
  and militarism. Oil-from-coal, many synthetic fibres and synthetic
  rubber are just a sample of the technologies which would not have
  survived in a global liberal free market. They were the product of the
  particular state system which operated to force nations into certain
  relations with each other. The very specific role of the state, and the
  specific nature of its competition with other states, has given states
  particular roles in the promotion of particular technologies. Even
  techno-nationalists have not recognised the centrality of the state
  system to twentieth-century technology. Techno-national projects
  were of the greatest importance, though their histories are not to be
  found in techno-nationalist writings. |
  Autarky and things
  Political and technological boundaries are different, but states have
  often acted to bring them into line, by controlling the movement of
  things across borders and by developing particular national technolo-
  gies. They have controlled the movement of things by tariffs, quotas
  and nationalistic procurement policies. They have developed national
  technologies by insulating the nation from the rest of the world,
  and by the direct funding of national innovation programmes. This
  practical technological nationalism has had wonderfully contradic-
  tory effects — far from making national technologies different, it has
  encouraged movement of technologies across political boundaries. It
  has also helped impoverish nations rather than strengthen them.

      In the histories of some nations, autarky became an explicit political
    economic programme, with the term itself being used by political
     actors, and historians have had no trouble in using it too. The most
    obvious and important cases are Italy under fascism, Nazi Germany,
    and Francoist Spain, where the period of autarquia lasted to 1959.
    Government protected industry, they engaged in import substitu-
     tion, they promoted strategic industries, linked to the military, and
    the state often had great control over domestic industry, sometimes
    through specialist bodies such as Mussolini’s IRI (Industrial Recon-
     struction Institute), and its Spanish variant established in 1941, the
    Instituto Nacional de Industria.”” The Soviet and Chinese blocs were
     also autarkic. Indeed, autarky was to become most extreme in nations
    which were isolated from the capitalist world and the socialist blocs.
     In North Korea Juche (self-reliance) was pursued from the 1960s when
    the country was isolated from both China and the USSR. Albania
     relied on the Soviet Union until 1960 and on China thereafter, but
    became increasingly autarkic from the early 1970s, and especially from
     1978 when China removed all support.
      In the middle years of the century many more countries were
     autarkic. Throughout the world, countries sought to industrialise, to
    replace imports with domestic goods, produced by local companies.
    Among the countries that turned to autarky was that previously enthu-
     siastic champion of free trade, Britain. Greece, the great commercial
     centre of the eastern Mediterranean, hardly known for manufactur-
     ing, also turned to autarky, under Metaxas in the 1930s. Often war
    elsewhere was crucial, forcing autarkic development to replace imports
     that were no longer available. Virtue was made of these necessities, for
    example in Argentina under General Peron, where national industrial
    development became a central policy of the regime. Similarly, India,
    South Africa and Australia developed new industries in this period.
     Autarky was supported by elements of the left, as well as the right.
     In the 1960s Latin American dependency theorists complained that
    under free trade nations exported raw materials while even their most
     basic manufactures were imported; they attacked their own countries

   as places which made nothing, invented nothing, which were for ever
   subservient to the metropolis. Breaking away from the world market,
  and developing national industries was essential to development and
   to independence. The European left too, at least in part, wanted to
  promote national industrial development strategies, and thus rejected
   free trade and indeed the European Common Market.
  Hydrogenation
  At the beginning of the twentieth century a French chemist, Henri
   Sabatier, showed that metal catalysts could be used to make possible
  the hydrogenation (the chemical addition of hydrogen) of many
  compounds, organic and inorganic. Three uses of hydrogenation
  turned out to be particularly important: the manufacture of margarine,
  ammonia and petrol. All three processes produced substitutes for
   older products: ammonia was used to make nitrates, replacing nitrate
  from Chilean guano deposits; petrol made from coal replaced that
   distilled from petroleum; margarine made from hydrogenated fats
  and oils substituted for butter and other forms of margarine. All three
  were to be closely connected to the national question in the twentieth
   century.
   The hydrogenation of nitrogen to make ammonia, pioneered by
   the German chemical firm BASF before and during the Great War,
  was of enormous importance to national power, not only because it
  created locally produced nitrogen fertiliser, but also because nitrate
  was a major source of explosives. In 1913 BASF began production at
  Oppau of synthetic ammonia, and a new plant was built at Leuna in
   1917. Coke, steam and air were the raw materials. In the war Oppau
  developed and operated the process for making nitrate from ammonia.
  No great power, it seemed, could be without ‘synthetic ammonia’ and
  governments sought to develop the Haber-Bosch and other processes
  (for there were a number of alternative ways of making synthetic fer-
   tilisers). In Britain, for example, synthetic ammonia, became central
  to the new enterprise, Imperial Chemical Industries, founded in 1926,
  taking over an initially state-sponsored project to make synthetic

```

```
    ammonia and nitrates at Billingham. Yet synthetic nitrogen fertiliser
     (mostly, but not only Haber-Bosch) was to become extraordinarily
     global, and indeed an industry of profound importance, particularly
     after the Second World War. Nitrate was poured on to the world’s
     fields after 1945, so much so that, by the end of the century, some
    one-third of the nitrogen in human food came from human-made
     nitrate.
     Perhaps the most important use of hydrogenation in terms of
     its national associations was the hydrogenation of coal. In the rich
    countries of the world, coal was the dominant source of energy of
     the first half of the twentieth century. Yet, very quickly petroleum
    became important as a source of power for cars, trucks and aero-
    planes (petrol) and ships (diesel and fuel oil). The leading western
    European nations did not have their own sources of supply — the
    main producers were the USA, Russia, Romania and Mexico. The
    German chemist Friedrich Bergius developed processes for making
    cheap hydrogen from coal; he then hydrogenated heavy oils, and
     in 1913, coal. Bergius started building a plant in Rheinau in 1915, to
    produce his oil-from-coal. This massive project was embarked on
    because Germany was about to become fatally short of petrol for the
     war effort. But Germany and Austria defeated Romania in 1916, and
     were thus able to secure access to its huge petroleum production. The
     lengthy and hugely expensive Rheinau enterprise was not completed
     before 1924. It was financed by various private firms, including Royal
    Dutch Shell and then BASF. IG Farben (a merger of the main German
    chemical firms including BASF) developed a variant of Bergius, with
     different catalysts and started building a plant at Leuna in 1927 (where
     it had hydrogen capacity for synthetic ammonia production). This
    ambitious new project brought together the main German chemical
     companies in the 1920s. By 1931 300,000 tons of petroleum were being
    produced (or in oil terminology, 2.5 million barrels) per annum.
      For the Nazis, self-sufficiency in fuel was a top priority under the
     four-year plan of 1936, and the establishment of synthetic-oil pro-
     duction was a key element towards the achievement of that objective.

   Hermann Goering was appointed ‘fuel commissar’.. The process
   chosen was IG’s hydrogenation, and the company built and ran many
   plants, including one for the new coal-based chemical complex at
   Auschwitz. As ever there were alternatives, and indeed the Fischer-
   Tropsch process, involving the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide
   rather than coal was also used. Other alternatives included generators
   of gas from wood for powering cars.”* By 1944 production was up to
   3 million tons, or 25.5 million barrels annually. These synthetic oil
   plants were extremely important to the German fuel economy during
   the war, and particularly so in the production of aviation fuel.
    After it was defeated, Germany was banned from hydrogenating
   and in 1949 was ordered to dismantle its plants. The Soviet Union
   took four to Siberia. Later in 1949 the decision was changed and
   the plants were converted to cracking petroleum. In East Germany,
   isolated from western oil markets, coal was hydrogenated until the
   1960s.” The chemical industry remained coal-based until increased
   shipments of petroleum from the USSR arrived in the 1950s. With the
   restriction of Soviet oil exports after 1979, there was a shift back to coal
   during the 1980s, another case of reappearance, with dire ecological
   consequences as the German brown coal generated a good deal of acid
   rain.’
    Coal hydrogenation was taken to many countries, but it never went
   global. In an autarkic age, technologies of autarchy internationalised.
   By the early 1920s the key patents were controlled by IG Farben in
   Germany, but the international rights in the early 1930s were controlled
   jointly by IG Farben, Standard Oil of the USA, the Anglo-Dutch oil
   company Royal Dutch Shell and the British chemical combine ICI. In
   Britain and the United States plants were built. In Britain ICI, taking
   over a good deal of work done in a government research station, set up
   a plant in Billingham which produced petrol between 1935 and 1958.
   As in Germany, the petrol produced had to be subsidised by various
   means. Spain developed a synthetic-fuel programme at Puertollano
   (Ciudad Real) following a 1944 deal between the pro-Axis Spanish
   government and Germany. In 1950 new deals were signed with BASF

    and others for technology and plant was built.*! Production started
     in 1956 and lasted until 1966. Spain had a hugely expensive R&D
    programme in the late 1940s and early 1950s, reaching 0.5 per cent of
    GDP, a remarkable proportion for a poor country of the period.”
     Another case was coal-rich South Africa where in 1955 the Sasol
    company started producing petrol using the Fischer-Tropsch process.
    Following the Arab oil embargo of 1973, Sasol II was built; the cutting
     off of supplies from Iran after that country’s 1979 revolution led to
     Sasol III.*> Like the German plants, the Sasol complex was bombed,
    not by the United Nations, but in June 1980 by Umkhonto we Sizwe
    (Spear of the Nation), the armed wing of the African National
    Congress. The attack marked a very important point in the develop-
    ment of the guerrilla war against the apartheid regime. Racist South
    Africa, run by its National Party, produced 150,000 barrels per day,
    twice the level of synthetic fuel production in Nazi Germany.” Oil-
    from-coal research started up again ona large scale in the 1970s, as the
     price of oil increased in 1973 and 1979, and looked to stay high. The
     oil companies and governments were involved once again, and sought
    out the records of the earlier Nazi effort.
      In the history of research and development coal hydrogenation
    should have a very important place. It was the biggest single project of
     the world’s greatest chemical firm of the 1920s and 1930s, IG Farben,
    and of Britain’s ICI in the late 1920s and early 1930s, as well as post-
    war Spain, and South Africa. Yet it never produced petrol which
    could compete in world markets. As a source of petrol it was of minor
    importance, except in the special cases of Nazi Germany and South
    Africa. In both places it was significant to history. It kept the Luftwaffe
    flying and apartheid in business.
    The nation is not everything
    Technology, like nationalism, crosses national borders; it does so in
    times and contexts we might not expect from national histories. For
    example, in nationalistic, totalitarian, autarkic, fascist Italy of 1935,
    there were places better connected technologically to the United States

   than to the rest of Italy. A case in point was the village of Aliano in
   what is now called Basilicata; there were 1,200 inhabitants, one car,
   one toilet, and far too many malaria-carrying mosquitoes.*> Yet the
   mechanical equipment of the village was American; its weights and
   measures the pounds and inches of the Anglo-Saxons, rather than
   the kilogrammes and centimetres of continental Europe. The women
   wove on ancient looms, but used scissors from Pittsburgh; the axe
   blades of the peasants came from America.** How come? Some 2,000
   men from Aliano lived in the US and sent home a ‘stream of scissors,
   knives, razors, farm tools, scythes, hammers, pincers ... all the gadgets
   of everyday life. The carpenters of Grassano, a larger and richer town,
   had American machinery.*” Connections between peoples did not
   follow the boundaries of nation-states, and had a consequence for the
   traffic in things.
    More remarkable is the case of military technology after the Second
  World War. Despite the Cold War and intense national efforts to
   develop national technology, in the 1950s the USA, Britain and the
   Soviet Union shared a remarkable amount of technology, aside from
   captured German technology. The multinational atomic bomb project
  became more multinational still, not because of scientific or techno-
   logical internationalism, but because of espionage by political interna-
   tionalists. They helped ensure that the Soviet Union made a near copy
   of the plutonium bomb in 1949.** Britain’s bomb, tested in 1952, also
   replicated the Los Alamos plutonium bomb. The first atomic bomber
   of these three powers was the same one too: in the early 1950s, all
   three were using the Boeing B-29. Britain was loaned them by the USA
   between 1950 and 1954. The USSR had a fleet of Tu 4s, copies of B-29s
   forced down on Soviet territory during the war. In addition British
  Nene and Derwent jet engines (and also copies) powered Soviet jet
   aircraft, notably the MiGi15s over the skies of Korea (the transfer was
   authorised in 1946).*? Indeed, the Nene engine was everywhere.
    After the Second World War a remarkable range of countries
   decided they needed not only to acquire jet fighters, and to manu-
   facture them, but to design them. Many of the experts came from

      newly nationalised Argentine merchant line in the late 1940s. They were named Eva
      Peron (shown here in trials on the Clyde, and the ship on which the author travelled
       to Britain in 1970), President Perén and 17 de Octubre. After the fall of Peron they
      were renamed Libertad, Argentina and Uruguay. The Libertad was in service on the
     Buenos Aires to Europe route into the early 1970s, before switching to Antarctic cruises.
    Germany, which was banned from having an aircraft industry. Its
    aeronautical engineers, including the most famous, went not only to
     the USA or the USSR but to such countries as Spain, Argentina, India
    and the United Arab Republic. These nations were at different periods
    and for different reasons ‘non-aligned’ with the two great power blocs
    of the post-war era — the Soviet Union and the USA. Argentina, India
    and Egypt, the main part of the United Arab Republic, had been to
     different degrees British imperial territories, and in all three German
     aeronautical expertise was used more than British.
     Under the nationalist-populist Peron regime, Argentina built a jet

   in the indigenous language, Mapuche, a sure sign of the nationalist
   impulse behind it. It was built under the leadership of one of France’s
   great aeronautical engineers, Emile Dewoitine, on the run from
   France, where he was wanted for collaboration.” He had arrived in
   Argentina in 1946, via Spain where he had gone after the liberation
   of France, and would stay in Argentina till the late 1960s.! He was
   to be replaced in 1947 by an even more famous designer, Kurt Tank
   (1898-1983), the key designer at Focke-wulf. Tank had nearly gone to
   the Soviet Union. He had met with one of the Soviet aeronautical
   experts, Colonel Grigory Tokaev, who claimed to have put him off
   from journeying to Moscow to see Stalin. Tokaev would soon defect to
   the British, partly because he was unhappy with the Russian national-
   ism that Stalin was imposing.” From 1947 Tank designed and built
   the Pulqui II jet, which flew, with Nene engines, in 1950. It was, like
   the Soviet MiG15, descended from Tank’s Ta 183. The Pulqui II never
   went into production and Tank and much of his team moved on to
   India. There they designed the supersonic Hindustan Marut fighter,
   in service from the 1960s to the 1980s: over 140 were built. This too
  depended on a British engine. India later collaborated with that failed
  pan-Arabic nation, the United Arab Republic (UAR), of Egypt, Syria
   and Yemen to design aero-engines for their national fighters. Again
  German expertise was central.
    The UAR aircraft programme had started in Spain.* Spain saw
   autarkic development in aviation, in the 1940s and 1950s, again with
  German specialists.** Claude Dornier (1884-1969) worked for the
  CASA company in Madrid, designing light utility aircraft for the
   military, also later to be built in Germany. Willy Messerschmitt (1898—
   1978) went to Spain in 1951. First he developed a jet trainer, which
  could also be used in combat, and a good number were built. Egypt
   started producing them in the 1950s and some were still in service in
   the 1980s (they were called Al-Khahira (Cairo) ).*” Messerschmitt (with
   the collaboration of Ernst Heinkel) also built the H300 supersonic
   fighter which never went into production, and was further developed
  by the Egyptians through the 1960s, without success. It too depended

```

     on British engines. These non-aligned technologies proved not to be
     very significant. Spain obtained US aircraft from the early 1950s; and
    Egypt and India turned to the USSR, as well as other suppliers.
    Foreign technology and socialism in one country
    The Soviet Union provides a particularly startling case of autarkic
    development based on foreign technology. Socialism in one country,
     the central dogma of Stalinism, depended on foreign expertise. The
     Soviet Union, and thus the rest of the Soviet bloc (including China for
     a while), relied on processes, and sometimes in effect products, first
    developed in the capitalist countries, particularly in the USA. Ford
     was one of many companies that transferred their equipment, skills,
    personnel and products there. The USSR not only imported but built
    Fordson tractors, as it did Ford’s Model A cars, and Model AA trucks.
    The tractors were produced in a plant in Kirov reconditioned by Ford,
     the cars and trucks in a large plant built in Gorky. The result of a
     deal signed with Ford in 1929, it was easily the largest vehicle plant in
     the USSR, producing nearly 70 per cent of output by the end of the
     1930s, around 450,000 vehicles per annum. The Gorky plant is still the
     second Russian producer of cars, and the largest maker of trucks and
     buses.*° There were two other plants for cars and trucks. The AMO
     factory in Moscow, rebuilt with US equipment, renamed ZIS and then
     ZIL, made cars and trucks to US designs. This plant was the parent of
     the Chinese First Automotive Works, formed in 1953, which made 1.28
     million Jiefang (Liberation) trucks between 1956 and 1986, another
    remarkably long-lived machine which was itself a copy of the ZIL 150
     4-ton truck.*”
      Apart from the production of Fordson tractors between 1928 and
     1933, the USSR bought two entire new tractor factories from the USA,
     one for Stalingrad, the other for Kharkov, to make International
     Harvester 15/30 machines. This was the tractor which had replaced
     the Fordson on American farms. A third new factory made the
     tracked Caterpillar 60, called the Stalinets, in Cheliabinsk. Counting
     the Fordson plant, the USSR had four plants by the mid-1930s, each

```
   meant to produce 30-50,000 tractors per annum.*® The USSR was to
   be tractorised with American-designed tractors.
    The other great symbols of Stalinism also depended on American
   expertise. Many of the gigantic dams and hydro-electric projects,
   such as the Dnieper complex, depended on US experts, skilled
   workers, designs for plants and product, and vast quantities of
   equipment. The famous steel works at Magnitogorsk, built partly by
   kulaks thrown off their farms at the time of collectivisation, was a
   copy of a US Steel Corporation plant. At the peak of construction
   in 1931 there were 250 Americans, plus other foreigners, directing
   the work at Magnitogorsk, just as there were in many other places.“
   The US plant was built from 1906 in Indiana on a greenfield site
   near Chicago named Gary, after Elbert Gary, the then chairman
   of US Steel. Thus even the naming of factories and cities after
   important people had roots in the USA.
    During the Second World War there was a wave of transfer of tech-
   nology, though not of production equipment. After the war there was
   a second wave, covering everything from marine diesels and fishing
   boats, to the chemical industry. In the 1960s the USSR once more
   turned to the West for car models and plant. A deal with FIAT led to
   the supply of (largely American) plant for a huge new complex that
   would produce versions of the Fiat 124 and 125 at the rate of 600,000
   per annum from around 1970. The resulting model, called the Lada in
   export markets, is still being produced today. The plant remains the
   largest car maker in Russia, churning out around 700,000 cars a year
   —at less than half the level of productivity of the main international
   firms. It was built in a new town on the banks of the Volga named
   Togliattigrad and was part of a giant scheme involving the building of
   the Lenin Dam on the Volga. The town was named after the head of
   the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, who had succeeded
   the imprisoned Antonio Gramsci. Both had studied and become
   politically active in Turin, home of FIAT; an essay written in prison by
   Gramsci was to be the source of the term ‘Fordism’ for the left at the
   end of the twentieth century.

     The Soviet Union was a poor country. The rate at which it took
     in foreign technology and industrialised itself was remarkable, as of
    course was the human cost it was forced to pay by Stalin. Its ambition
    was not merely to emulate, but to create a new and superior society,
    more innovative and more capable of using new technologies than
     crisis ridden, uncoordinated capitalism. The planned economies, with
    no significant private ownership, and no competition from capitalist
    enterprises for very long periods, would prove superior, it was claimed.
    From 1957, following the launch of Sputnik, many non-communists,
    indeed anti-communists in the West, came to believe that the Soviet
    Union had indeed cracked the problem of innovation and use of new
    technology. Khrushchev’s famous declaration in the early 1960s that
     the Soviet Union would overtake capitalism was not a personal exag-
    geration but an expression of a long-standing and deeply felt inter-
    pretation of the likely course of history. Yet despite vast investments in
    R&D the Soviet Union and its satellites did not lead the world into a
    new technological era. Generally the Soviet Union lagged, and that lag
     increased in the 1970s and 1980s. The Soviet historian Roy Medvedev
    plausibly claimed that Lenin would have been surprised to find that
    the USSR had not overtaken the capitalist world in technology by the
     1980S.
     The classical Soviet view was that there was one technology, what
    mattered was the context in which it operated. It made all the differ-
    ence in the world, they claimed, that although Soviet workers worked
    under the same division of labour as capitalist workers and were paid
    by the piece, they (indirectly) owned the means of production. Yet
    one finds some suggestions that Soviet technology took a different
    course from capitalist technology. Notably, it is argued that there was
     a particular tendency towards gigantism, the most recent expression
    of which is the Three Gorges dam in China. That seems doubtful as
    similarly gigantic projects can be found in the USA; indeed the Soviets
    were inspired by them. However, there may well have been much more
    pointless gigantism, such as the famous case of the White Sea Canal,
    extending for over 200km from Leningrad to the White Sea. Though

   built in the early 1930s, and still open, it has hardly been used. It took
   more than 100,000 workers to build. Most were convicts, and most of
  them apparently died during its construction.
    After 1945 the most technically advanced part of the Soviet bloc
  was not the Soviet Union but the German Democratic Republic.
  And from here came ‘group technology, trumpeted as a specifically
   socialist technology. It involved the grouping of work of particular
   types of machine in batch production to increase its efficiency. The
   idea was to analyse components and set up groups of machines (cells)
   to produce a range of related components. Group technology was not
   a thing, but a means of organising specific forms of production, and
   one which turned out to be completely compatible with capitalism.
  The technological leadership it was hoped would derive from this
   never materialised.” The GDR is also known for a distinctive car, the
   Trabant, another exceptionally long-lived machine. It had a synthetic
  body, and a 2-stroke 5oocc engine. It was in production in the same
   factory from 1957 to 1989; around 3 million were built, with maximum
  output of 100,000 units per annum in 1970s."' Yet it was not copied
   even within the Soviet bloc. It was clearly a particular response to all
   sorts of shortages of materials, not a brave new venture in car tech-
   nology. The GDR also provides one of the few cases where it has been
  shown that a planned system clearly led to rapid diffusion of technol-
   ogy: the GDR’s health system pioneered the widespread use of a Swiss
  technique for dealing with broken bones.”

     Even before the First World War, Ford, the Chicago meatpackers, the
    major electrical firms such as GE, Westinghouse and Siemens, major
    armourers such as Vickers, and the Singer Sewing Machine company
     operated around the world.
      The technological capacities of firms, national and multinational,
     need to be distinguished from those of their home nation. The pho-
     tographic industry exemplifies the need to look at firms and their
     histories. At the end of the nineteenth century, knowledge about the
    photographic process was concentrated in Europe, and yet by1914a US
    company, Eastman Kodak, dominated photography in most countries
     of the world. Kodak was to compete against different kinds of firms.
     In Britain, specialised photographic firms, merged into Ilford Limited
     in the 1920s, were a reasonably strong alternative. In Germany and
     elsewhere, the chemical giant IG Farben, under the trade name Agfa,
     was the key competitor. Each firm had different technical resources
     and innovated different kinds of colour photographic processes. IG
     Farben, the world’s leading dye firm, was able to make a film called
    Agfacolor in which it had embedded most of the complex reagents that
     were necessary to process the film. The film could thus be processed
    by amateurs and chemist’s shops. Kodak developed expertise in dyes
     and fine chemicals during the Great War, and it used this to produce
    Kodachrome, a film that relied on very complex processing, which
    had to be done by Kodak in its existing network of processing facili-
     ties. Kodachrome and Agfacolor, introduced in the 1930s, were ‘sub-
     tractive’ processes. By contrast, the Dufay process, promoted by Ilford,
     was ‘additive’ — it essentially created three different photographs, each
    occupying a third of the image, a process which required no expertise in
    dye chemistry. By the 1930s Britain had that expertise, Ilford did not.
      The early history of television provides another interesting case,
    though the key connection is not to Germany as in the case of synthetic
     dyes, but to Russia. Two key technical leaders, Isaac Schoenberg of
    EMI and Vladimir Zworykin of RCA, were both Russian, and had
    both studied with the Russian pioneer, Boris Rosing, at the Imperial
     Institute of Technology in St Petersburg, before the Great War.®

```

```
  Zworykin arrived in the USA in 1919; Schoenberg in Britain in 1914.
   But the key organisation at the centre of this activity was the Radio
  Corporation of America, Zworykin’s employers. It had investments
  and technical connections in two key European firms which supplied
   the modern TV equipment, EMI in Britain (Schoenberg’s employers),
  and Telefunken in Germany. The Marconi-EMI system developed in
   Britain was directly derived from related RCA work. More intriguingly
   still, RCA was to transfer a great deal of technology to the USSR before
   the Second World War, including television, such that RCA technol-
  ogy was used to broadcast TV in the USSR before the USA.™ Britain,
   Germany, the USA and the Soviet Union, all developed television in
   an experimental form at the end of the 1930s, based on RCA technol-
   ogy. It is worth noting that with the exception of what happened in
   the USA, television, like broadcasting generally, was under the direct
   control of the state in these countries.
   Nation, empire, race
   In thinking about the relations between the global and the national in
   the history of twentieth-century technology it has been obvious that
   things, expertise and experts crossed political boundaries all the time.
  The importance of these boundaries changed, and radically so, over
   time. The boundaries themselves changed too. Nations were hardly
   eternal. More than that, multi-national states were hugely important.
  The USSR was a multi-national state, half its population was non-
   Russian; its ‘national’ anthem had been, until 1943, the ‘Internationale’.
  Trans-national political commitments were also important. Italian
  communist engineers went to the Soviet Union in the 1920s. While
  post-war Spain had many German and Italian technicians working
   there, there were many Spanish experts elsewhere. There were Spanish
  aeronautical engineers working in the French aircraft industry in
  Toulouse who would not have wanted, or been able, to work in nation-
   alistic and autarkic Spain.’ Most important in this respect were the
   close links between the Soviet Union and China between 1949 and
  1960. One of the most bizarre was the political link between China

     and Albania in the 1960s and 1970s following the decisive break in
     relations between China and the USSR. Albania relied on Chinese
     technology; the common language was the Russian dominant in the
     Soviet Union, the source of much of the Chinese technology.
      The great empires of the twentieth century were also hugely
     important trans-national and trans-ethnic political and technologi-
     cal entities. Far from being throwbacks to the past, empires were
     intimately associated with particular new technologies, for example
     long-distance radio broadcasting, aviation and tropical medicines.
    They lasted into the 1950s. But empire not only left a technological
     mark, post-imperial relations did too. One finds few French cars in
     India, or British cars in Tunisia.
      National and imperial boundaries were often radically less
     important than racial boundaries within nations and empires. For
    many European intellectuals a sense of scientific and technological
     superiority was crucial.°° Much discussion of inventiveness in particu-
     lar was associated with racial and cultural analyses which transcended
     nations. In the United States blacks were deemed by whites to be un-
     inventive, to the extent that a pioneering sociologist of invention
     noted that it is ‘inadvisable to count in the colored populations of the
     United States and the British Dominions’ in computations of relative
     national inventiveness ‘since these people do not figure in invention.”
     Another analyst of the 1920s argued that the USA had low per capita
     inventiveness because ‘the United States have a dilution in the negroes
     in our population.’ If women had been distributed unevenly around
     the world the same argument would have been made about them.
      In the USA the armed services were racially segregated, and the
     black formations were generally of very low status. There were,
     for example, no black pilots in the US forces in the interwar years.
     However, from 1941 there was segregated training for black pilots
    who would go into segregated squadrons; only after the war were US
     forces officially desegregated. Bell telephone maintained segregation
     and did not employ black telephone operators pre-war; after the war
     they did so only because the labour market forced them to.*? While in

   the interwar years there were large numbers of black car mechanics
   and taxi drivers, many whites held blacks to be bad drivers with no
   mechanical sense. No place in the world is more symbolic of the
   new technologies of the late twentieth century than ‘Silicon Valley’
   in California. Perhaps 80 per cent of the production workers belong
   to ethnic minorities; and the great majority were recent immigrants
   (many of them Spanish-speakers) to the USA, and are women.°! Many
   of the technical staff are South and East Asian.
    Sometimes, of course, some have celebrated what they see as their
   lack of invention by their own community. The celebrated Martinican
   poet of negritude, Aimé Césaire, lauded
    those who invented neither powder nor the compass
    those who have never been able to tame steam or electricity
    those who have explored neither the seas nor the sky
    Eia for those who have never invented anything
     for those who have never explored anything
     for those who have never subjugated anything.”
   But many others, including the dependencia theorists, lamented, for
   example, that “La diosa tecnologia no habla espanol’, which meant
   Spanish speakers were not notable in the world of research and
   invention.® ‘Que inventen ellos, said the Spanish essayist and rector
   of the ancient University of Salamanca, Miguel de Unamuno, before
   1911. The phrase has achieved notoriety among those who want to see
   invention flourish in Spain, and indeed no rector of the University
   of Salamanca would say it today. A document prepared by a ‘western
   intellectual’ around 1960 claimed that Russian and ‘Eastern Slavonic
   nations’ were ‘much less inventive and imaginative’ than the Anglo-
  Saxon nations. But the Soviet bloc was inventive in many ways and
  Homo sovieticus was not a slav.*
    These comments reflect very substantial differences in partici-
  pation in elite inventive activities. Only sixteen non-whites have

    won Nobel prizes in science and medicine, but not one has been
    of African descent, despite the fact that the USA, the clear leader
     in the Nobel prize league table, has a very large African-American
    population.* Very few Spanish speakers have won science or
    medicine prizes, while Spanish-speaking writers and poets from
    many nations have been garlanded with the Literature prize. Latin
    America, Africa and some parts of Asia produce few patents, while
    most of the Northern Hemisphere, including Japan and Korea,
    turns them out in prodigious quantities. Uruguay and Brazil give
    two patents per million population to residents, while Finland
     gives 187. In the USA there are worthy listings of African-American
    inventors; the fact that such lists are manageable points to the small
    numbers involved.
      Racial and cultural differentiation was far from confined to
    invention. In the great empires there was a profoundly racial economy
    of technology in use. Empire created rich enclaves for European col-
     onisers in colonies and near-colonies, with motor cars, telephones,
     electricity, running water, cinemas and so on. These were places such
     as the international settlements in Shanghai, Carthage/Tunis, Casa-
    blanca, Ismailia (on the Suez Canal), New Delhi, Singapore, and others.
    On a smaller scale, enclaves for white engineers and workers from
     the rich world were dotted around the poor world. Thus American
    employees of the United Fruit Company lived in special compounds
     in the company’s banana plantations in South and Central America;
    while American and other engineers had special housing and facilities
     in the USSR in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
     Within imperial territories race was central to social organisation.
     In all the places where white technology went, white technicians were
     in control. The pilots who steered ships through the Suez Canal were
     British and French, not Egyptian. On the vast Indian railway network,
    the great majority of its senior engineers were white British. In the
    interwar years whites born in India became more important, as did,
     at lower levels, mixed-race ‘Anglo-Indians’ or ‘Eurasians, of whom
    there were over 100,000. Into the 1930s there were still many British-

   born locomotive drivers among the large number of Anglo-Indian
   train drivers. In the Dutch East Indies (later Indonesia) the railway
   equipment, down to the rails, was imported from Europe. Until the
   end of the colonial era, only some parts of carriages and the sleepers
   (made of teak) were local. At least as late as 1917-18 ‘not a single clerk,
   station master or machinist was a non-European. Motor vehicles
   were much more open to natives.” In 1935 the number of native car
   owners was just below the number of European owners, and just over
   the number of ‘foreign oriental’ owners; however, there were twice
   as many licensed native drivers as Europeans, who presumably were
   chauffeurs and taxi drivers.”
    There was a particular racial order in the vast British merchant
   marine that served in India and elsewhere. It depended to an
   extraordinary degree on ‘lascars’,, seamen recruited from the Indian
   subcontinent. In 1928 there were more than 52,000 lascars aboard
   British ships; 26 per cent of all crews, and 30 per cent of engine-

    room crews. Special regulations applied to their employment, for
    example in voyages through cold seas.” There were divisions along
     geographical, religious and ethnic lines: Catholic Goans served in
     ships’ galleys and acted as waiters and servants; Muslim Punjabis
     dominated in the engine room; and deckcrews, both Muslim and
    Hindu, came from many places.” Needless to say these British ships
    were all officered by white British mariners.
     The Indian army, officered very largely by white officers, was
    given older and less powerful equipment than all-white forma-
     tions of the British army.’”’ The pre-war Indian Navy and Air Force
     (created 1933) were tiny. In India non-technical higher education was
    much more widely available to Indians than technical education;
     British technical education was much more technical than its
    Indian offshoots.” When they took over Malaya from the British,
     the Japanese boosted technical education for Malays and Indians as
     well as local industrialisation.””
      It is little wonder that the end of imperialism was so important to
     national technological development, and indeed that nations emerging
     out of empires felt a strong need not only to develop national tech-
     nologists but national technologies too.
    Asia and techno-nationalism
     Japan represents the great twentieth-century exception to white
    dominance in technology. A strong, imperial state in the early twentieth
    century — among its colonies were Taiwan, Korea and, for many years,
    much of China — it was a serious technological power by the interwar
     years. The so-called Prussia of the East replicated Britain with its great
    navy and cotton textile industries of the interwar years. Even in defeat
     after the Second World War, Japan kept control of its economy, and
    Japanese-owned and -controlled firms not only imported technology,
    but began to generate technologies of their own. Japan rose to be the
    second performer of research and development in the world by the
     1970s. At the same time its car and consumer electronic industries
    posed a serious threat to North American and European companies.
     In this respect the Japanese were much more successful than the

   Soviets, another power which had spend a great deal on importing
   technology and on research and development.
    The Chinese case is quite different from the Japanese, or indeed
   from the Korean and Taiwanese cases. Although nationalism was and
   remains a very important part of communist politics in China, the
   opening to the world since the late 1970s has not led to the develop-
   ment of a powerful local technological infrastructure. Most of China’s
   exports, especially in the electronic sector, come from foreign-funded
   and foreign-owned enterprises, rather than either state-owned or
   locally privately owned ones. In any case, much of China’s exports are
   low-tech: textiles, toys and all sorts of other cheap goods. If Wal-Mart
   were a country, it would be China’s eighth largest trading partner.
   There is however one distinctive aspect of foreign enterprise in China
    — it is mostly eastern rather than western. It comes from Japan, and
   from the so-called overseas Chinese. The Chinese minorities in
   Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines have been central to indus-
   trialisation and technical development in these post-imperial nations.
   Political structures, and ethnic and linguistic links are interacting in
   complex ways.
     Yet nationalism, and national control, is far from dead in the new
   globalised China. The internet, supposedly necessarily an agent of
   internationalisation, is thoroughly controlled in China. Search engines
   do not recognise words, such [as ] [‘democracy, ] [which ] [the ] [government ]

             War
    The First World War was a chemists’ war because of the innovation
    of gas warfare; the Second World War a physicists’ war because of
    radar and atomic weapons. Now we are living through a revolution
     in military affairs linked to innovations in information processing.
    Many accounts of the relations of technology and war tell us this
    simple innovation-based story. But even a cursory look at the military
    technologies in use will make clear just how misleading a picture that
     is. Even at the end of the twentieth century, war was a matter of rifles,
     artillery, tanks and aeroplanes, as it was many decades earlier. These
    technologies of war are surprisingly invisible as technologies. If we go
     to the great national science and industry museums of the world, we
     will not see them. We will find aircraft, radar and atomic bombs, but
     as applications to war of civilian sciences and technologies.
     There is a division, implicit but powerful, between things which
    belong to the realm of the military and those in the world of science
    and technology that are taken to be essentially civilian. It suggests that
     the great innovations in arms in the twentieth century were in essen-
     tially civilian technologies applied to war, and that they transformed
    twentieth-century war. They did this by civilianising and totalising
      it.' Put another way the key themes are the industrialisation and civil-
     ianisation of war since the late nineteenth century.* War becomes a
    matter of turning over the whole of society to the mass production of
    weapons, to total, industrial war in which civilians in factories are as

   much combatants, and thus targets, as soldiers on the front.
    The military, and war itself, have often been seen as left-overs from
   the past. War was not something which modern, democratic, indus-
   trial and free-trading nations did. Soldiers, particularly officers, were
   relics of an older agricultural and warlike society, which like chivalry,
   would disappear as modernity marched on. Modern war was a tragic
   clash of old and new.
   The conventional story
   The conventional story of the relations of war and technology in the
   twentieth century uncannily parallels techno-globalist accounts of the
   place of technology in global history. It is an innovation-centred story
   invoking some very familiar technologies. It goes like this: in the late
   nineteenth century, new private arms firms applied the new civil tech-
   nologies of steel-making and steel-working, and the new chemistry,
   to armaments, producing new guns, new ships, new explosives and
   propellants. This led to a new kind of warfare which required the mass
   mobilisation not only of soldiers but of civilian industry.’ Later in the
   twentieth century new technologies developed which further revolu-
   tionised and civilianised warfare. The key ones were the aeroplane, not
   only the product of civil industry but able to make civilians targets.
   Later came the atomic bomb, the product of civilian (perhaps even
   pacifist) academic science. More recently, military experts have influ-
   entially claimed that there has been what is now widely called a ‘Revo-
   lution in Military Affairs, driven by information technology.
    The civilian, technological way of war was quite different from
   and superior to older methods.* The expert on aviation at London’s
   Science Museum held in the 1940s not only that “Total war’ was ‘made
   possible by the aeroplane’, but that it had ‘reversed all the traditional
   concepts of warfare, notably by including many civilians among its
   casualties.° In 1946 H. G. Wells wrote of the First World War: ‘First the
   Zeppelin and then the bombing aeroplane carried war over and past
   the front to an ever-increasing area of civilian activities beyond. The
   old distinction maintained in [civilised ] [warfare ] [between ] [the ] [civilian ]

         bombardment of the Shanghai South railway station, 28 August 1937.
    and the combatant population disappeared.° The atomic bomb, the
     great glory of civilian academic science, went further still — and led to
     a new kind of war or non-war directed by civilian Dr Strangeloves.
     Change in the military, and in war, is seen as driven by civil factors
    from outside the military. The military, if they are ascribed an ideology
     at all, are labelled ‘militarists’ a term which implies backwardness,
     even in fighting wars. As Ernest Gellner put it, ‘civil societies’ have
    vanquished ‘militarist romantic’ nations.’ The wimps and cissies, the
     nerds of history, have overcome the specialists in, and celebrators
     of, violence. Such oppositions between the military and the civil are
    deeply ingrained. As George Orwell brilliantly noted, the key opposi-
     tions running through H. G. Wells’s work were ‘On the one side science,
     order, progress, internationalism, aeroplanes, steel, concrete, hygiene:
     on the other side war, nationalism, religion, monarchy, peasants,
    Greek professors, poets, horses.’ Again and again, the romanticism

   of the military is contrasted with enlightened science, technology and
   industry; militarism and modernity are incompatible, even if they
   have in practice come together many times in the twentieth century.’
   Like military intelligence, military science (except in the sense of the
   art of war), and more surprisingly, military technology, are close to
  oxymoronic. If culture had kept up with science and technology, the
  argument went, war would have been abolished. The ‘cultural lag’ was
   a cause of war.
    The military are nearly universally regarded as being particularly
  prone to the ‘cultural lag not surprisingly since they were themselves
   seen as a left-over from the past. The military appear in stories about
   science and technology as resistant to new technology, sometimes
   for good reasons, usually not. According to one military intellectual,
   Basil Liddell Hart, writing in 1932, the ‘progress of weapons, has out-
   stripped the progress of the mind — especially in the class who wield
  weapons. Each successive war of modern times has revealed the lag
  due to the slow pace of mental adaptation’.'° Another soldier, in a pio-
  neering book called Armament and History, published in 1946, warned
   that ‘civil progress is so intense that there is not only a danger but a
   certainty that no army in peacetime can in the full sense be kept up
   to date.'' Lewis Mumford put the point graphically: ‘Fortunately for
  mankind, the army has usually been the refuge of third-rate minds ...
   Hence the paradox in modern technics: war stimulates invention, but
   the army resists it!’!* The histories amplify these stories. Before the
   First World War, it is claimed, admirals thought submarines ungentle-
  manly, and generals irrationally defended cold steel and horses against
  machine guns. Even during the war, it is suggested, the generals failed
   to understand the logic of the new warfare and kept on fighting old
  wars, with the result that millions of lives were unnecessarily lost.
   Histories of interwar armed forces feature sailors who dismissed the
  power of aviation (despite Billy Mitchell’s powerful demonstration
  of the power of bombs against battleships in the 1920s), and army
   officers who refused to accept the logic of motorisation and tank
  warfare. For the years after the Second World War the complaints are

```
     more muted. Yet we have soldiers who did not want to give up tanks to
     helicopters and precision-guided weapons; aviators who do not give
     up on fighters or bombers, in an age when missiles will obviously take
     over, and sailors who clung tenaciously to surface ships.
      The military, resistant to new technology, needed new technology
     from the creative, private, civilian sector. For those who believed in
     this way of thinking about military technology, the results of military
     conservatives meeting progressive civilian technology were unfortu-
     nate. Peacetime military technology had a grotesque, distorted quality.
     The military corrupted essentially civil technologies. There was then,
     and this has continued since, a systematic downplaying of the military
     origins and significance of the aeroplane. Indeed in the 1930s many
     concerned with writing about aviation saw the military aeroplane as a
     corrupted and deformed aeroplane. If it had been allowed to develop
     freely, instead of being frustrated by military needs and nationalistic
     governments, and the rich, aeroplanes could have developed along
     more proper or normal lines, and indeed have given the world peace.
     These ideas have not disappeared. According to one theory, right
     through the twentieth century the conservative military wanted more
     powerful versions of existing weapons — battleships, tanks, aero-
     planes — not to shift to new ones. The result was a ‘baroque arsenal’,
     an over-elaboration of existing technologies of war leading to rapidly
     diminishing returns, indeed to negative returns. In war, according to
     this model, crisis conditions result in the overthrow of military con-
     servatism and the adoption of radical new technologies and ways of
     fighting war, of civilian origin. These new forms themselves become
     baroque in the ensuing peace."
    Old weapons and killing in war
    How plausible is the above account? We have already challenged
     elements of these stories with accounts of the importance of the
     horse in the German army, and cost-benefit analyses of strategic and
     nuclear bombings and the V-2 programme in the Second World War.
    We have noted the long lives of battleships and some bombers, and

   One crude but necessary way of approaching the question of tech-
  nology and war is to ask what technologies killed people in twentieth-
  century war. Of course, killing is not the key objective in most wars,
  victory is, but many of the key wars of the twentieth century, against
  the hopes of the advocates of new technology (who tended to see in
  them the power to make war short, decisive, humane), killing was
  the means to victory. The killing of civilians too became a means to
  victory.
   For all the focus on novel weapons, the well-established ones
  became the great killers. For the Great War of 1914-19, western
  European images of the Western Front invoke the relatively novel
  machine gun and poison gas as the main handmaidens of the grim
  reaper. Yet experts have long known otherwise. Of the 10 million
  who died in the Great War in Europe, and they were overwhelmingly
  soldiers, 5 million died from artillery fire and 3 million from small
  arms in combat. The Western Front saw important developments in
  artillery practice which hardly enter the popular picture of the war.
  The last years of the Great War, particularly on the Western Front in
  1917-18, saw a revolution which inaugurated, according to a recent
  account, ‘the modern style of warfare. This involved large forces of
  heavy artillery, centrally coordinated, firing indirectly (by the map),
  on to specific targets, obtained by intelligence (including, crucially,
  that from air observers and aerial photography). This was not the
  result of any particular technical innovation, but of devising a new
  system of deploying heavier guns with much more ammunition at
  their disposal, systematic testing, the development of great accuracy
  in long-range firing, and the routine use of intelligence and com-
  munications. It is a story of the combination of many technologies,
  with new patterns of organisation.'* The essentials of ‘revolution in
  military affairs’ of the late twentieth century took place more than half
  a century earlier than is usually claimed.
   For all the claims for a new kind of war that emerged in the interwar

     years, the Second World War was even more artillery-intensive than
     the Great War. In the Second World War, the Soviet Union alone lost
      10 million soldiers; half were killed by big guns, and 2 million were lost
     to small arms. Of the remainder, 3 million succumbed to starvation
     and disease in German prisoner of war camps. Taking all the twentieth
     century wars up to the mid-1950s about 18 million were killed by big
     guns, 5 million in the Great War, 10 million in the Second World War
     and 3 million in other wars.'° This made the big gun the single largest
     killer of soldiers.
      Small arms come second to big guns as a source of combat deaths,
     reaping the appalling total of 14 million lives, up to mid-century. The
     rifle in particular has been ubiquitous in twentieth-century armed
     forces. They are an example of the significance of a relatively simple
    weapon that was widely used, and indeed of one that was unchanged
     even in the most powerful armies for very long periods. The British
     used basically the same Lee-Enfield rifle, the SMLE, from the beginning
     of the century to the late 1950s. Around 5 million were built worldwide,
     including for the huge Indian Army which was 2.5 million strong in
     1945. In the former British India, British Lee-Enfield 303 rifles are still
     everywhere. The US army used the M-1 from 1936 to 1957. Four million
     M-1 Garands were made and nearly 3 million M-1 carbines. A variant
     of this weapon, the M-14, was in use until the 1960s. The M-16, which
     replaced it, was a new kind of rifle, lighter, and using a much smaller
     bullet, (5.56mm.), than the .303 inches (7.7mm) of the Lee-Enfield, or
     the .30 inches (7.6mm) of the M-1, or the 7.62mm NATO standard.
     The M-16 and variants (which included the M-4 carbine) were also
    produced in large number; no fewer than 7 million. It is still in service.
      These figures are as nothing compared to those for the Soviet
     Kalashnikov assault rifles (usually known slightly misleadingly as
     the AK-47). The Kalashnikov was introduced in 1947 (hence AK-47).
      It fired 7.62mm ammunition. The 1947 model was replaced in the
     late 1950s with the AKM which was much lighter (3.2kg). In 1974 the
     Soviet forces began to adopt the AK-74, a slightly adapted weapon

```

```
  which fired 5.45mm ammunition. Various generations of the Kalash-
  nikov are in service all over the world. It was the weapon not only of
  the Soviet bloc forces, but of the Chinese too. It was a key weapon of
  liberation movements. The former Portuguese colony of Mozambique
  put the Kalashnikov on its flag. But the Kalashnikov was also provided
  by the US, and other right-wing regimes, to the guerrilla forces they
  supported, for example the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan. The produc-
  tion history of the Kalashnikov was extraordinary. Estimates range
  from 70 to 100 million made since 1947, out of an estimated total pro-
  duction of automatic rifles between 1945 and 1995 of 90-122 million.
  The famously rugged and cheap Kalashnikov may be contrasted with
  the seemingly more troublesome and ‘gold-plated’ weapons of the
  west.
   The post-Second World War assault rifles, which could fire
  powerful bursts of lead, and not just single shots, hugely increased
  the firepower of small infantry formations. The cost to civilians in
  war zones has been enormous. With such weapons it was easy to
  massacre the inhabitants of a village, as US troops did in Vietnam
  over and over again. Conflicts between people which might have left
  a few dead were now more likely to kill many more. Not surpris-
  ingly the spread of automatic assault rifles to Africa in particular
  has been a huge cause of concern. It is often suggested that it is new
  light weapons that have made this trend possible; young boys could
  not have fired the old heavy ones. Yet the Burmese army trained
  its boy soldiers, the most numerous in the world, on the heavy, old
  German G3 which, at four feet in length, was taller than some of the
  young conscripts.'° In any case, British schoolboys enrolled in the
  cadet forces of private schools, long drilled with and fired the heavy
  303 Lee-Enfield. It is the cheapness and the power which make the
  difference.
   The rifle was the weapon that civilianised war, much more so than
  the aeroplane or the gas chamber. In his brilliant book The Twentieth
  Century Book of the Dead, some data from which has been used above,
  Gil Elliot calculates, for the period before around 1970, that some 6

     million civilians were killed in massacres, and 4 million in formal
     executions.!” The main rivals to small arms were enforced hunger and
     disease, and small arms played a critical role here too, by being a key
     weapon in population control. The Holocaust of Eastern European
     Jewry was as much a matter of small arms, hunger and disease, as
     of poison gas. Barbed wire, that simple yet deadly material, played
      a key role in confining people.'* Using the most primitive weapons
     and techniques the German armies in Eastern Europe killed almost 30
     million people. In every theatre of war the aeroplane killed, perhaps, 1
     million. The cost of small-arms wars in Africa in recent years has been
     enormous. The second Congo War (1998—) has been responsible for
     an estimated nearly 4 million lives, mostly civilians lost to disease and
     starvation. This makes it, some say, the deadliest war since 1945. But
     they have underestimated the killing in Vietnam.
    Paradoxes of lethality
     Measuring the power of military technologies is of course extremely
      difficult. As in the case of battleships and nuclear weapons we are
     reduced to some measure of how big a bang they make rather than
     actual or potential military effectiveness. These problems can be
     considered by looking at the case of land armaments. Twentieth-
     century weapons fired more bullets further, they fired more and
     bigger shells. This is seemingly consistent with the greater number of
     casualties in twentieth-century wars than in previous ones. However,
     despite the increase in the raw power of these weapons, the casualty
      rate in a given period of combat fell quite dramatically. In the nine-
     teenth century daily casualty (killed, wounded and missing) rates,
     that is the number fallen in each day of combat, were around 20 per
     cent for defeated forces and around 15 per cent for the victors. These
     figures include the American Civil War. There had already been a sig-
     nificant fall: around 1600 the figures had been 30 per cent and 20 per
     cent respectively. Yet in the twentieth century these daily casualty rates
     dropped precipitately, to around 10 per cent and 5 per cent for the
     Great War, the same in the Second World War, and 5 per cent and 2 per

    19. The bomber was a lethal instrument, but bombing could be defended against
   and lived through under reinforced concrete. The photograph shows the entrance
    to Hitler’s air raid shelter (left) and air shaft (right) in Berlin, after the war. Hitler
  survived the bombing, to commit suicide as the Red Army approached. The Red Army

  cent in the Arab-Israeli wars. This extraordinary paradox is not due
  to a lower intensity of firepower in a given day of combat. It was due
  to the way forces responded to greater firepower. They dispersed in
  space, making themselves much less vulnerable. A Second World War
  artillery battery could easily destroy an infantry division if it marched
  into battle in the close order of a Napoleonic division, but dispersed
  like a twentieth-century infantry division it would be a much harder

     target.'? What better illustration is needed of an understanding of the
     context of use?
      Despite the drop in the effectiveness of weapons measured by daily
      killing rates, the overall level of casualties increased because battles
     were also dispersed in time. Instead of lasting a few hours, as they did
     from the classical period into the nineteenth century, they went on for
     days, weeks, months and even years. Troops could be kept supplied
     with all the necessities of a fighting army for very long periods, despite
     the fact that the level of supplies required daily also increased.
     Power and effect — unused and unusable weapons
     The aeroplane was not the only great destructive technology of war
     that did not have the devastating and decisive effect predicted. The
     great dreadnought battleships of the first half of the twentieth century
     were among the most powerful weapons of their day. They could
      deliver, many times over and over huge ranges, the weight of explosive
      a Second World War bomber could deliver only once every sortie.
     Battleships of the interwar years could fire many shells of nearly one
     tonne further than 30km; it could take more than one minute for the
      shell to reach its target.” They could hit moving targets miles away,
     with the help of computing devices.
       Yet, these extraordinary machines, symbols of naval power, were
     hardly used in their intended role. In the Great War the British and
     German fleets barely engaged, except in one day-long battle in the
     North Sea, at Jutland. The Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts left their
     Adriatic ports rarely. Overall the losses of battleships and battlecruis-
      ers in this otherwise bloody war were low, essentially through lack
     of combat. At Jutland, Britain lost three and Germany two, but for
     the whole war only six dreadnoughts and battlecruisers were lost in
     action (plus twenty pre-dreadnoughts). The great battleship fleets in
     the Second World War saw more continuous action than they had in
     the Great War. In many cases the ships were of course the same ones.
     The result was that the toll of battleships was much greater: Japan
      lost eleven, Britain five, Germany three, the USA two, Italy one (to

  Germany) and the Soviet Union one. The great battleship killers were
  air power and submarines. British naval air power greatly reduced the
  Italian battleship threat in 1940; at Pearl Harbor Japanese air power
  sunk two battleships (and damaged many more), and soon after sank
  two British battleships; thereafter Japanese battleships faced relent-
  less attack primarily from the air. Only one British battleship was lost
  to a battleship; two German; and four Japanese. But that total too is
  greater than Great War losses.
   The history of the battleships in the Great War, and to a much
  lesser extent in the Second World War, points to the significance of the
  threat of use, rather than actual use. The British battleships stationed
  in Scapa Flow imposed a punishing blockade on Germany simply by
  being there. It led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of civilian
   lives. In the Second World War, the German battleship Tirpitz had an
  extraordinary effect, just by lying in a Norwegian fjord, from where
   it threatened convoys sailing to the Soviet Union. Indeed twentieth-
  century military history is full of examples of the significance of non-
  used technologies of war. In the Second World War all the combatants
  put huge efforts into gas and biological warfare, mostly of Great War
  types, and defences against them, but they remained unused.”' Mustard
  gas was one of the key ones. It would not be used until the Iraq—Iran
  war of the 1980s, as was a quantity of nerve gases of a type developed
  in the Second World War. After the Second World War, and especially
  from 1950, many states had greater peacetime military establishments
  than ever before. NATO and the Warsaw Pact powers faced each other,
  particularly in Europe, with military equipment that was in many
   cases never used in battle conditions. The greatest example was, of
  course, atomic weapons, whose stock piles were built up relentlessly
  from trivial numbers even in the early 1950s, decade by decade. Not
  only were these weapons unused, they were soon unusable. For the
  power of the H-Bomb introduced [in ][the ] [1950s ] [was ] [such ] [that ] [firing ][off ]

    Technological and economic determinism in war
    One important argument derived from the view that total war was
     civilian and industrial was that in the final analysis it was the stronger
      civil economy which would vanquish the weaker one. This view of
     war has a good deal going for it, at least for the two world wars of
     the twentieth century. In both of them, the resources Germany and
      its allies could draw on were significantly smaller than those of its
     ultimately victorious opponents. And yet, the link between national
     military capability and national civilian economic and technologi-
     cal strength is not straightforward. Quick victories could be won
     against economic and technologically superior adversaries. That is
     what Germany did in 1940: it was not superior to a combination of
    Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, France and Great Britain, yet
      it beat them all on the continent of Europe.** Germany would lose
     the war, but primarily to a power that had started economically and
     technologically weaker than itself, the Soviet Union. It was able to
     produce vast quantities of weapons despite being desperately poor
     and technologically backward in many areas. So poor was the USSR
     that it was very short of paper ‘but in this respect the war years were an
     age of plenty, because with their equipment the British and Americans
     sent us ton-loads of instructions, printed on one side only and on the
     reverse of these sheets we planned our Katuishas and aircraft’ said one
     aeronautical engineer.”
       It is not even obvious that the side with the better machinery of war,
     other things being equal, will win a battle or a war. What happened
     in France in May 1940 is an example. Britain’s mighty navy and its
    bomber force could do little to help the French, but more infantry
     with more rifles and artillery might have made all the difference. Even
      so, the balance of military equipment on the ground in France did not
     necessarily favour a German victory: Germany won by using surprise,
     speed and daring. The conquest of Malaya by the Japanese provides
     another example. In late 1941 this important and well-developed British
     colony, centred on Singapore, was held by a large and well-equipped
     force of British and imperial troops. Yet a smaller and technologically

  weaker Japanese force invaded from the north, landing from the sea.
  Unable to bring horses, they brought a few trucks, and planned to req-
  uisition bicycles from the local population. Living off the technologi-
   cal land in this way they were able to equip each infantry division with
  6,000 bicycles (along with 500 trucks), and pursued an extraordinary
  ‘bicycle blitzkrieg’ along Malaya’s good roads, forcing the country to
  surrender remarkably quickly. Daring generalship, as well as requi-
  sitioned bicycles, gave the Japanese an extraordinary victory. For all
  these brilliant early successes, Japan and Germany saw their forces
  defeated in the field by overwhelmingly stronger opposition, and their
   cities and civilians mercilessly attacked. They were comprehensively
  defeated by powers which did indeed stress the economic and techno-
  logical factors in war.*°
    After the Second World War the technological way of warfare was
  central to the armament efforts of the great powers. From nuclear
  weapons to new anti-personnel weapons, from new communica-
  tions technology to military psychology and operational research,
  the military invested huge proportions of their budgets on research-
  ing, developing and procuring new weapons and methods of warfare.
  Strikingly, the technological and industrial intensity of the air and
  land wars against poor nations from 1950 was much greater than that
  against richer adversaries in the Second World War. The tonnage of
   air, land and sea munitions expended per American serviceman, was
  eight times greater in Korea and twenty-six times greater in Vietnam
  than in the Second World War.” Not surprisingly the disparity in
  casualties was stupendous. In Korea in 1950-53, the US-led forces used
  43 per cent of the munitions used by America in the Second World
  War, expending perhaps ten to twenty times the amount spent by the
  North Koreans and Chinese. They suffered 94,000 dead; on the other
  side military casualties were three times greater. Civilian casualties on
  both Korean sides came to 2 million.” In Indochina, from the 1960s
  and into early 1970s, the USA used twice the quantity of munitions it
  used in the Second World War, blasting an unseen enemy with indirect
  artillery fire and aerial bombardment. American dead were just under

     60,000. The South Vietnamese army suffered much heavier losses,
    some 270,000, while the North Vietnamese army and the Vietcong
     lost 1,100,000 dead. Vietnamese civilian deaths were atrocious: some
     200—400,000 civilians in South Vietnam alone. The North Vietnamese
     estimate is of 4 million dead civilians, North and South.”
      Disparities in killing power did not determine victory, however. In
     Korea the US was fought to a standstill by North Korean and Chinese
     forces, with Soviet assistance. Most spectacularly and significantly
     of all, Vietnamese peasants, enrolled in the Vietcong and the regular
    army of North Vietnam, defeated a superpower. The bicycles of the
    Ho Chi Minh trail defeated the B-52s. That such a weak power could
     even stand up to the USA and its modern weapons had a profound
     political effect around the world. Military and economic might, it
     seemed, could be defeated by political commitment. For some soldiers
     it revealed the need to return to older military thinking rather than
    what was seen as an engineers’ quantitative approach to war, a position
     reflected in the film Apocalypse Now.”
      This US reverse had a major consequence for thinking about tech-
    nology on the Left. The socialist and communist movements had been
     deeply committed to some kind of economic or technological deter-
    minism — this was a standard official interpretation of Marxism in the
     first two-thirds of the twentieth century. It suggested that military might
     followed from technological might. Thus, for Stalin, economic and
     technological development was a matter of military necessity. Yet even
     within this tradition the view emerged that morale and political commit-
     ment could overcome technologically superior forces. Chinese Maoists,
     in particular, focused as they were on the peasantry, saw both reaction-
     aries and nuclear weapons as ‘paper tigers’. But in the 1960s, the Western
     Marxists too turned decisively away from ‘economisny and indeed tech-
     nological determinism, to emphasise political action, culture, ideology.
     Peasants and students would form the new revolutionary vanguard, not
     the industrial working class of the rich countries.
      Guerrilla rebellions took place in many parts of the world. In Africa
    and South America a wave of military activity was stimulated by the

```

```
   possibility of victory. A particularly striking example is the still-con-
   tinuing rebellion against India by Maoist guerrillas known as the
   Naxalites, who since the 1960s have had extraordinary success in the
   tribal areas of eastern India, relying in part on bows and arrows and
   ‘country made guns’, including flint-locks.*° But by the late 1970s the
   great powers, as well as non-socialist movements, were using guerril-
   las against stronger forces. The United States, too, had learned about
   the power of the guerrilla. It funded guerrilla armies attacking the
   legitimate government of Nicaragua, and most importantly the Islam-
   icist peasant war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
   The weak have developed new military techniques, among the most
   notable being the suicide bomber, a tactic employed by the Tamil
   Tigers in Sri Lanka, the Palestinians in the occupied territories, and,
   on a much larger scale, by insurgents in Iraq following the US-led
   invasion of 2003.
   Iraq and the past
   The history of war in Iraq over the last two decades provides many
   examples of the complex interaction of the old and new in warfare,
   and of the dangers of naive futurism. Here old wars were fought, and
   the wars of the future were supposedly pioneered by applying the
   Revolution in Military Affairs.
    The story starts in 1979. Contrary to all the models of modernity,
   a brutal, modernising monarchy [— ] [the ] [apple ] [of ][America’s ] [eye ] [— ] [had ]

       20. Unknowingly preparing to fight the next war but one: a fifteen-inch naval gun
      being made by Vickers before the Great War. More than 180 were produced for British
       battleships. Most were still in service in the Second World War, where they found
                   more use than in the Great War.
     The war also saw the first large-scale use of ballistic missiles since
     the Second World War. The rockets were derived from the V-2 of that
     conflict. In 1955 the Soviet Union deployed a V-2 based missile later
     called the Scud A. In 1962 it put into service a derivative Scud B, which
    was to become AK-47 of the missile world. Iraq got its supplies from
     the Soviet Union in the 1970s, while Iran obtained them from Syria,
    Libya and North Korea. Each side bombarded the other’s cities with
     these weapons. Iraq had to modify its Scud Bs very considerably to hit
    Tehran, which it did for some weeks in 1988, a period of the conflict
    known as the ‘war of the cities. Hundreds of Scud Bs were fired. On

```
   the eve of, and following, the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, Afghanistan
   was supplied with many Scuds which were fired against Mujahedeen
   positions.
    The year 1991 saw the US engage in major warfare directly for the
   first time since Vietnam. It launched a massive attack to force Iraq out
   of Kuwait. In mid-January an extraordinary air offensive began which
  would see some 6,000 tons of ‘smart’ bombs, and some 80,000 tons
   of ‘dumb’ bombs, dropped. The result was the destruction of Iraq’s
   infrastructure, including its electricity supply, oil supply and com-
   munications. For all the talk of ‘smart bombs’ decapitating command
   and control this was Second World War economic warfare at particu-
   larly high intensity and precision. Thirty-one per cent of US bombs
   were dropped by the ancient B-52s. Recall too that the USS Wisconsin
   was present, bombarding the land with 16-inch shells. As ever, despite
  rampant propaganda that strategic bombing was finally effective, this
   verdict has been powerfully contested.
    While the destruction was overwhelming the effect on the capacity
   of the Iraqi army to operate and fight was nowhere as significant as
   implied. The army was bulldozered into the ground by superior US
   land forces, which would easily have won without the strategic bom-
  bardment. The land war was extraordinarily one-sided, as was shown
  by the minimal US casualties compared with the undisclosed level of
   Iraqi losses. As some American analysts put it afterwards, this was a
   first-world army confronting a third-world force, but in circumstances
  where might would win.*' Yet we should recall that these land forces
   were composed, on both sides, of formations deploying weapons
   familiar from the Second World War: many tanks, field artillery, rocket
   launchers, and large numbers of infantry carrying rifles.
    Apart from smart bombs, the most public new technology of the
   first Gulf War (1991) was the Patriot anti-missile system deployed by
   the USA. A key part of the Star Wars programme, anti-missile systems
   were themselves controversial. During and after the war US officials
  claimed the Patriot was a stunning success, destroying more than 96
  per cent of Scud-type missiles fired against Saudi Arabia and Israel.

```

-----

```
    That claim for their accuracy was reduced in the face of criticism to 61
     per cent, representing, it was claimed, twenty-seven successes against
     forty-four Scuds. Using the army’s methods, a 61 per cent success rate
     is fully consistent with the known conclusion that ‘Patriot did not
     destroy a single Scud warhead.’ What they had done was to claim
     success for the Patriot if 1) a Patriot missile got to where it was told
     to go by its targeting computer, which was most of the time; and 2) if
     the Scud caused no significant damage or casualties on the ground.
    Simply by missing a target — hitting the sea, or the desert, or failing
     to explode — the Scud became a victim of the Patriot. The army was
    assuming, implicitly, that the Scud was a 100 per cent effective weapon,
    when it was a very poor one indeed.
      In the second Gulf War of 2003, strategic bombing was repeated,
    and this time also an army was immediately victorious, conquering
     the whole of Iraq very quickly. But controlling the country proved
    much more difficult, and continuing operations against US forces have
    kept this Gulliver pinned down in central Iraq. The disproportion in
     casualties between the imperialist forces and the locals becomes ever
     greater, but victory is no more assured.
    Torture
    The United States responded with counter-insurgency operations
     linked with systematic interrogation and torture. This became known
     to the world through photographs of what had been done at an Iraqi
     prison, Abu Ghraib. Torture was, as ever, explained away as the unau-
    thorised work of low-ranking soldiers, the result of indiscipline. There
     isa much bigger story to be told. Before the Second World War torture
    was seen as a feature of more bestial past times, and a few foreign
    despotisms. What was certain was that it was disappearing, and had
     no place in civilised society. In a history of torture published in 1940
     there is not much on the twentieth century, and little if anything that
     is seen as new.** Of course the Nazis were associated with torture, but
    they were generally seen as a throwback. Yet the years after the Second
    World War, far from seeing the retreat of torture, saw its extension and

   its technological refinement. New forms of torture were devised and
  used on a widespread scale, becoming routine in their application,
  and in many cases brutally effective.
   One of the most distinctively modern forms of torture was the use
  of electric shocks. It has been claimed that the picana eléctrica was
   invented in Argentina, where it was introduced in 1934.*4 This little
  machine was, apparently in a different version, used by the French in
  Indochina and above all in Algeria. The French exported their tech-
  niques directly to Argentina and to the United States, whence they went
   to the rest of Latin America and to Vietnam.* It is known that officers
  of the United States government trained the police and military of
  friendly governments, such as Iran, in the use and methods of torture
   from at least the late 1960s. One such instructor, Dan Mitrione, under
  the cover of being an official of the Agency for International Develop-
  ment (AID), set up a torture school in a house in Montevideo in the
   late 1960s. According to a fictionalised account, he started by lecturing
  army and police officers on the nervous system, but ‘at no point ...
  does he hint that these nerve centres and sinews will later be used
   to guide the electrical prod: he goes over everything as though this
  were a medical faculty lecture room, employing only the most aseptic,
   neutral, scientific terminology.” Later in the week four beachcombers
   are brought in to be used as ‘case studies’ for the class — all are tortured
   with the electric prod, and then killed. The electric prod, the infamous
  picana, became the instrument of choice of South America’s torturers
   in the ‘dirty wars’ of the 1970s.*” Torture was a key instruments of an
  unbridled state terrorism which flourished particularly in that decade:
   it was applied to tens of thousands of mostly young people.
  War, technology and the history of the twentieth century
  Most military technologies of the twentieth century have had military
  origins and limited applications outside war. That is obviously the case
   for small arms, artillery, explosives and tanks. To this list other technol-
  ogies should be added, despite the impression that is often given that
  they are civilian technologies merely temporarily applied to war. The

     aeroplane, as we have seen was primarily a military technology. The
     radio, too, was first a military technology and was long connected to
     state power. Radar, an important new application of radio, developed
     in many countries in the interwar years, mostly in military-related
     contexts. The British radar system, which was far from being the only
     one installed in the late 1930s, drew on long military experience of air
     defence going back to the Great War.”
      Even the atomic bomb project, so often seen as the work of scien-
     tists, and thus primarily academic and civilian, was directed by the
     military and related agencies. The military engineer Brigadier-General
     Leslie Groves, not the academic physicist Robert Oppenheimer, ran
     the project. Among the many great industrial enterprises involved was
    DuPont, which was not just a chemical company, but long the major
     military explosives supplier in the USA.” In any case much of the
     theoretical work on the bomb was not a matter of nuclear physics,
     but of fluid mechanics, the science at the core of aerodynamics. The
    bomb was the product of old institutions and old sciences, as well as
    new ones. The military have been much more important in the devel-
    opment of technology than the civilian innovation-centric picture has
     allowed.
      As a consequence we have underestimated not only the contribu-
     tion of military institutions to military technology, but to civil tech-
    nology as well. The civil aircraft industry was just a branch of the
     core military industry; nuclear power was a spin-off from nuclear
    bombs and submarine reactors; much of radio and radar likewise is
     a spin-off. Early control theory and computing were a spin-off from
    problems relating to the control of heavy naval guns.*” And one could
     add other names and other technologies, notably computers and the
     internet, to the Japanese camera firm Nikon.*! Sometimes examples
     have been used to help justify military expenditures. At other times
     the military origin of civilian technology is used to show the negative
     influence of militarism on modernity.” An example is the computer-
     numerically-controlled machine tool, introduced through US air force
     funding in the 1960s for the manufacture of aircraft, and then very

   widely diffused. Military funding has pushed technologies towards
   being more authoritarian than they would otherwise have been. Far
  from liberating us, modern technology has been the tool of conser-
   vative not revolutionary forces. Old power relations are transmitted
  through new technology.
    The aeroplane, the radio, radar, the atomic bomb should be in
   military museums, alongside guns, tanks, uniforms and regimental
   colours. The military are not usefully thought of as remnants from
   the past who were reluctant adopters of the new. Rather, they were
  among the key shapers of the new. They should thus also have a place
   in museums of science and technology, along with the seemingly old
  weapons that did so much to shape twentieth-century war. But neither
   sort of museum is likely ever to have a section on killing technologies,
   to which we now turn.

            Killing
    The history of the non-military technology of killing is confined to
     the chambers of horrors, black museums, the private collections of
    ghouls. It has no place in more respectable museums except in the
     special case of genocide memorials. A museum of killing technology
    would confront us with uncomfortable questions. Killing, like war and
     the military, has been seen as something barbaric which the civilising
    process had left behind. But the rate of killing — of all sorts of living
    things — increased in the twentieth century, and did so drastically.
    For plants, bacteria, insects, cattle, whales, fish and human beings,
     the twentieth century was murderous. The civilising process did not
    reduce killing. What it did was to remove killing from the public arena
     — whether the execution of the criminal or the despatch of a chicken.
      Putting killing into the history of the twentieth century is a par-
     ticularly powerful way of exploring the interaction of old and new. It
     is a story which includes, in unexpected ways, nationalism, globalisa-
     tion, war, production and maintenance. It will particularly disturb
    our sense of technological time, and of what is significant.
    Innovation in killing
    An innovation-centric history of twentieth-century killing would be
    focused on the killing of insects, plants and micro-organisms, princi-
    pally but not only in relation to farming. Around 1900, there were few
     killing techniques available to the farmer: a few insecticides and fun-

    21. In the supposedly transparent twentieth century even the killing of animals has
    been put beyond reach, not only of the public but also of photographers. In the late
    nineteenth century one could find stereographs of the great butchers of the New
   World, including this rare image of an animal being killed. The original caption read:
    ‘Sticking Hogs, Armour’s Great Packing House, Union Stockyards, Chicago, USA,
  gicides, and the hoe. The twentieth century saw many new chemicals
  designed to kill small living things. The 1930s and 1940s were a partic-
  ularly innovative period. In the 1930s an IG Farben chemist discovered
  organophosphate insecticides. The organophosphates were one key set
  of post-war organic insecticides, the others were chlorinated organic

    compounds. The first and most famous of these was DDT. First used
     for the killing of lice and mosquitoes, it became a general-purpose and
     very widely used insecticide. Many others would follow, and continue
     to be used after DDT was increasingly restricted from the 1970s.
     Chemical herbicides also changed radically in 1940s. The main new
     one was 2,4-D, an amazing example of simultaneous discovery — four
     separate groups, two in the UK and two in the US, came up with it.!
      DDT, organophosphates as well as 2,4-D and other herbicides were

```

```
   a crucial part of the green revolution in the rich countries. Their use
  transformed production and the landscape. As a result of these her-
  bicides unwanted weeds perished in vast quantities leaving fields of
  uniform crops. Insects suffered from this, as well as from insecticides.
  These powerful chemicals introduced new and invisible dangers to
  the countryside. This was exposed in one of the great books of scien-
   tific activism of the century, the naturalist and science writer Rachel
  Carson’s Silent Spring, in 1962.
    Insecticides and pesticides also found applications in warfare. DDT
  was widely used, as we have seen, to clear areas of malarial mosquitoes
  in the Second World War, as well as to control the typhus-carrying
  louse. The USA's chemical warfare service looked at possible military
  applications of 2,4-D. In South East Asia throughout the 1960s a
  programme called, of all things, ‘Operation Ranch Hand’ used up
  to twenty-five aeroplanes to drop 19 million gallons of herbicide to
  destroy the economic basis of the Vietcong and to remove cover. The
  infamous ‘agent orange’ was nothing more than a particular mixture
  of standard commercial herbicides including 2,4-D.’
   The killing of micro-organisms also saw a great deal of innovation
  in the twentieth century. Best known were the new compounds used
  to kill bacteria in humans, such as Salvarsan, the sulphonamides of
  the 1930s and the most important, penicillin, developed in the 1940s.
  Such compounds were used not just in humans, but also in animals,
  where they were essential to control disease in the tightly packed
  animal populations of the new industrialised husbandry. There were
  other applications: in the 1940s it was discovered that penicillin made
  chickens grow faster, for reasons still unclear. As a result, in the mid-
  1950s one-quarter of all US antibiotic production was put into animal
  feed; by the 1990s, with production much higher, it was about one
  half, mostly for growth promotion.’
   The twentieth century brought innovation in anti-virals: treatments
  for herpes, polio and smallpox were developed in the 1950s, though
  they were in the latter cases overtaken by immunisation; Acyclovir
  in the 1970s; and in response to HIV/AIDS, AZT in the 1980s. Anti-

     fungal treatments received an enormous boost with the 1957 launch
     of Nystatin. This was an unusual substance since it was patented by
     two female scientists who worked in the public sector, in this case the
     New York state department of health (hence the name). The 1960s
     brought Daktarin. New anti-malarials, such as paludrine and chloro-
     quine, came out of a massive targeted research effort in the USA and
     Britain during the Second World War. No one has ever estimated the
      toll taken of the world’s viruses, bacteria, mould, amoebae, insects and
     plants by these new poisons.
      In terms of the killing of higher animals, the innovation-centric
    museum would have relatively little to show. The key killing technology
     has remained the knife blade applied to the throat, though this was in
     some cases, as in chicken-killing, mechanised. Fish were generally still
     suffocated after being caught in a net, and whales harpooned. Such
     significant innovations as there were came in stunning technology.
      The history of innovation in killing humans is better known.
     Chemical warfare arose in the First World War with such agents as
     mustard gas and phosgene; atomic and bacteriological warfare followed
     in the Second. There were subsequent innovations in all these areas.
     In the 1930s organophosphate insecticides were recognised as exceed-
     ingly toxic to humans, and this led to effective ‘nerve gases. Tabun and
     Sarin were manufactured by the Germans during the Second World
     War, and in the 1950s Sarin became a standard nerve gas, produced
      in, among other places, Britain. In the 1950s the company ICI intro-
     duced a new organophosphate insecticide that proved too toxic to use.
     Transferred to the USA, it formed the basis for a new class of chemical
     weapons, the “V-agents.* VX, one such agent, was central to the US
     and Soviet arsenals. Uranium and plutonium bombs led to a variety
     of more powerful fusion weapons, and such things as neutron bombs,
     which were designed to kill people without destroying things. All sorts
     of gruesome biological agents were developed too. Again the years of
     the long boom proved very productive.
      Outside warfare, the innovation-centric story had few reference
     points. First was the gas chamber in the 1920s in the USA (the electric

   chair was a late nineteenth-century innovation), and the lethal injection
   in the 1980s, also in the United States. Only one other country figured
   in this story: Germany. For the central innovation in the killing of
  humans, and by far the most problematic for our understanding of
  modernity, is the killing with Zyklon B in the Holocaust. Innovation-
  centredness leads to looking at Auschwitz as the great modern factory
   of human death.
   An innovation-centric history of killing would be a great advance
   over the current neglect of killing. Yet in the case of killing in particu-
   lar the deficiencies of an innovation-centric approach are particularly
  obvious. For we all know of the continuing use of long-established
  means of killing, particularly human beings and higher animals,
  things such as ritual slaughter knives, gallows, the garrotte, the guillo-
   tine or the electric chair. Just as in the case of war, killing technologies
  provide, as we shall see, many examples of long-lived, disappearing,
  reappearing and expanding ‘old’ technologies. Without recognising
   this the history of killing makes little sense.
  Whaling and fishing
  Whaling, often thought of as a nineteenth-century industry supplying
   oil for lamps and whale-bone for corsets, went through a revolution
   in the 1920s. The new whaling relied on hunting the difficult-to-catch
  rorqual whales (a family of baleen whales including the Blue, Minke
  and Humpback) in Antarctic waters. The killing was carried out with
   a nineteenth-century invention: the deck-mounted harpoon. It was
  hoped that new methods of killing would replace it, but nets, poisons,
  gas injections and rifles did not produce better results. In 1929 a
  German engineer called Albert Weber started working in Norway on
  means of electrocuting whales, which was further experimented on
   in the 1930s and 1940s; however the expected result that modern elec-
   tricity would replace the barbarous harpoon did not materialise. The
  nineteenth-century killing technology would have to do. °
    It came to be used more than ever, as whaling expanded enormously,
  driven by the demand for margarine and by economic nationalism.

```

-----

```
    Already before 1914 whale oil was being hydrogenated for margarine,
     but by the 1930s this was its main use. It was used to make some 30-50
     per cent of all European margarine.° In 1930-31 Atlantic whale oil pro-
     duction was the same as French, Italian and Spanish combined olive oil
    production. Whale oil margarine was mainly consumed in Germany,
     Britain and Holland, and supply was dominated by the Anglo-Dutch
     firm Unilever. In 1933 the Nazis began promoting German butter
     against margarine and Unilever, making a point of stressing the use of
    whale oil. Yet Unilever was forced to finance the building of a German-
     flagged whaling fleet, making Germany a whaling nation for the first
     time. Fats were important for national security.
     The new whaling involved processing whales in floating factories
     that hauled dead whales into their bellies through a ramp at their
     sterns. The first floating factory built in Germany, the Walter Rau,
    named for the owner of the main German margarine firm, went to
     the southern oceans in the mid-1930os. In its first season it processed
     1,700 whales, from which it produced 18,264 tons of whale oil, 240
     tons of sperm oil, 1,024 tons of meat meal, 104 tons of canned meat,
     114 tons of frozen meat, 10 tons of meat extract, 5 tons of liver meal,
     21.5 tons of blubber fibre and 11 tons of glands for medical experi-
     ments.’ By 1938-9 the Germans were deploying five owned and
     two chartered factory ships. The Japanese also went into large-scale
    whaling at this time. After the Second World War Germany was
    prevented from whaling for some years but its factory ships were
     used by other powers.* Whaling boomed, and up to twenty floating
     factories were operating in the Antarctic, more than ever before, but
     the catch never reached the peaks of the 1930s, and collapsed in the
     early 1960s.’ Whales are one of the most significant cases of disap-
    pearing animals of the twentieth century, more extreme than the case
     of elephants.
     Whaling is closely related to the development of industrialised
     fishing, which is in turn intimately connected with refrigeration.
     Fishing ports had long had large refrigeration plants to make ice to
     chill fish at sea, but freezing fish itself at sea was not successfully

  accomplished until decades after the freezing of meat. The driving
  force was Commander Sir Charles Dennistoun Burney, inventor
  of the mine-sweeping paravane in the Great War, a key figure in
   British airships in the 1920s and a Conservative MP. He developed
  new freezing equipment, and adapted his mine-sweeping paravane
   for trawling. Burney converted a wartime minesweeper into the
   1,500 ton Fairfree, the first stern trawler, one which hauled in its nets
   just as a whale factory ship hauled in dead whales. In 1949 Fairfree
  was bought by the Scottish shipping and whaling firm Christian
  Salvesen, which then built the first fully designed factory stern
  trawler, the Fairtry.'°
    As with so many cases of innovation, it was not the innovating
  nation which would most use the new technology. Copies of the
  Fairtry were built for the Soviet Union, first in Germany and then
   in the USSR." The first Soviet freezer trawler, the Pushkin, went
   into service in 1955, and the Soviet fleet would soon dominate world
  factory fishing, especially with a class of ship called the BMRT, intro-
  duced in the 1960s. The Soviet fleet became many times larger than
   its nearest rivals, and led the way in strip-mining the fish colonies.
  Catches went up so much that they reduced fish populations. The
  great Newfoundland Grand Banks fishery peaked in 1968; thereafter
   its yield plummeted." Yet for all the destruction of stocks in particular
   areas, factory fishing continued to expand. The most modern ships,
   for example the American Monarch, of 6,000 tons GRIT, can process
   1,200 tons of fish a day. Since the total global catch is now 100 million
  tons per annum, this suggests that, say, 300 of these ships could catch
   all the fish now caught worldwide.’ Just one new ship accounts for 15
  per cent of Ireland’s entire catch.
   Of course, the factory trawlers are not the only means of catching
  and killing fish — the world still has an enormous variety of fishing
   vessels. Around the world boat-building yards still construct fishing-
  boats out of wood, even though they will be equipped with engines,
  radar and synthetic nets. These [new ] [hybrid ] [technologies ] [are ] [as ] [new ]

     types of fishing technology are themselves expanding. For example,

    Slaughterhouses
     Just over one hundred years ago, at the very end of the nineteenth
     century, the British writer George Gissing visited poverty-stricken
     southern Italy looking for remains of Greek and Roman civilisations.
     In the city of Reggio di Calabria he found one of the few new things
     he thought worthy of praise: a ‘handsome’ building, which he thought
     was a ‘museum or gallery of art. To his surprise he found this “fine
     structure, so agreeably situated, was nothing else but the town slaugh-
     terhouse’. He saw it as a ‘singular bit of advanced civilisation, surprised
     that such a building which reminded him of ‘the pole-axe and the
     butchers’ knife’ should so advertise itself. He had the odd sense of
     ‘having strayed into the world of those romancers who forecast the
     future; a slaughterhouse of tasteful architecture set in a grove of lemon
     trees and date palms, suggested the dreamy ideal of some reformer
    whose palate shrinks from vegetarianism’.'* Advanced thinkers of the
     time, such as Gissing’s friend, H. G. Wells, were attracted to vegetari-
     anism and a vegetarian future.
     On the other side of the Atlantic, another writer was to picture
     a very different kind of slaughterhouse. Upton Sinclair, in his great
      socialist novel of 1906, The Jungle, described the booming, corrupt,
    business-dominated city of Chicago. Among the giant enterprises he
     discussed were the great meatpackers, a world away from Europe’s
     most modern municipal abattoirs (another, mentioned with approval,
     was the International Harvester factory). Here was a new kind of mass
     industry, with astonishing methods of production and unprecedented
     control over workers and government. Around the Union Stockyards
     was ‘a square mile of abominations’, where ‘tens of thousands of cattle
    crowded into pens whose wooden floors stank and steamed contagion.
     Here too were the ‘dingy meat factories’ with their ‘rivers of hot blood,
     and carloads of moist flesh, and rendering vats, and soap cauldrons,

   glue factories and fertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hell’.'5
  Here was ‘pork-making by machinery, pork-making by applied math-
   ematics. The ‘slaughtering machine ran on ... like some horrible
   crime committed in a dungeon, all unseen and unheeded, buried out
   of sight and out of memory’.'°
    The central character in the novel, a Lithuanian immigrant, becomes
   a socialist. He learns that the Beef Trust was ‘the incarnation of blind
  and insensate Greed. It was a monster devouring with a thousand
  mouths, trampling with a thousand hoofs; it was the Great Butcher
   — it was the spirit of Capitalism made flesh’ Bribery and corruption
   were its methods, it stole water from the city, dictated sentences for
   strikers; it lowered the price of cattle, ruined butchers, controlled the
   price of meat, controlled all refrigerated food transport.'”
    To understand the uniqueness and significance of these reeking
   factories of death, it is illuminating to cross not the Atlantic with the
  thousands of Calabrians who went to North America and the River
   Plate, but instead the Mediterranean a century later, against a new
   tide of migration into Europe. In late twentieth-century Tunisia, on
   several main roads through the desert there were concentrations of
   nearly identical small buildings lining each side of the road. Tethered
   next to many were a few sheep; hanging from the buildings were the
   still fleece-covered carcasses of their cousins. For these were butchers’
  shops and restaurants. As the heavy traffic roared by one could dine,
   on plastic tables, without plates or cutlery, on delicious pieces of lamb
   taken straight from the displayed cadaver and cooked on a barbecue
  crudely fashioned from sheet metal. Clearly this spectacle was not a
   left-over from the past, or the sort of thing which attracted tourists.
   It was something new: a drive-in barby for the Tunisian motorist and
   lorry-driver in a hurry.
   Along the road one could see the upmarket version — a skinned
   sheep’s carcass in a refrigerated glass case placed outside a roadside

    introduced to the delights of northern dairy produce, and many other
    products of the new food industry.
      Refrigeration was crucial to the new globalised food industries of
     the twentieth century. It was used to preserve fish, meat, fruit, butter,
     cheese and eggs.'* But in the case of meat it had particular impor-
     tance, making possible a new kind of global meat supply system. The
     1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica claimed that refrigeration on a ‘com-
     mercial scale has more powerfully affected the economic conditions
     of England and, to a less degree, of the United States than any other
     scientific advance since the establishment of railways and steam-
     boats’. It is a big claim, both because refrigeration does not seem to
    be that important, and because few remember just how important
     the importation of refrigerated food into Britain was even before the
     Great War, or how important this was for the global economy. For the
     late twentieth-century world the claim would be stronger still, and
     applied not just to Britain and the USA, but to the whole world, criss-
     crossed as it was by refrigerated lorries carrying every kind of material
     in what came to be called ‘cold-chains’'? Many carried equipment
    made by a company called Thermo-King which, from 1940, manufac-
     tured the refrigeration gear patented by an inventor, Frederick Jones
     (1893-1961). He was the first black (as he is universally labelled, despite
    having a white father) to be awarded the National Medal of Technol-
    ogy of the United States. The other major company, the Carrier Cor-
     poration, pioneered air-conditioning at the beginning of the century.
     Its founder, Dr Willis H. Carrier, was named one of the hundred most
     influential people of the century by Time magazine in 1998.
      There were alternatives to refrigeration, even in the case of meat.
     For example, the River Plate had been at the centre of a global meat
    system decades before the introduction of refrigeration. Up to 1910
    Uruguay’s exports were still dominated by tasajo, or carne seca (salted
     dried beef). Previously given to slaves in the Americas, it now fed their
    descendants, particularly in Cuba and Brazil, and still features in the
     cuisine of both countries. Criollo (creole) cattle were slaughtered and
    processed at ‘saladeros’, salting plants (which also produced hides

    Refrigeration greatly increased the long-distance trade in meat.
   In Chicago — a city which had grown in the late nineteenth century
   as a producer of salted pig-meat which went in barrels to markets
   far away — meat was chilled by ice and sent to eastern cities in
  railroad cars. Later, meat was also frozen and chilled mechanically.
  Drawing on vast supplies of cattle, the Chicago meatpackers turned
   into massive concerns such as Swift, Armour, Wilson & Co, Morris,
  and Cudahy, the Beef Trust. The giant US meatpackers had been
  important exporters of meat — salted, canned and chilled beef — but
  by 1900 they could not supply much to the world market from the

    USA. That market was largely Britain, which imported half its meat
     and accounted for 70-80 per cent of all meat traded internation-
     ally. In some places in Britain, the proportion was higher still. For
     example, over 80 per cent of all the beef consumed in London in
     the 1920s was imported, mostly from Argentina. Indeed much of
     Britain’s meat came from a trans-equatorial trade: from the River
     Plate, Australia and New Zealand. Already by 1912 there were four
    Southern hemisphere plants capable of freezing or chilling more
     than 500 beef carcasses a day, all in Argentina.” In this trade the
    Chicago meatpackers were to be crucial, along with British firms.
      Uruguay’s first frigorifico was not opened till 1904. Swift set up the
     second meatpacker (Frigorifico Montevideo) and Armour the third
     (Frigorifico Artigas). The fourth was set up in the early 1920s when
     the British Vestey family took over and remodelled the Liebig plant,
    now named Anglo del Uruguay as a frigorifico. The Vestey companies
      — centred on Union Cold Storage — formed one of the largest food
     enterprises in the world in the interwar years, rivalling the giant
    American firms. It owned not only slaughterhouses, but a shipping
     line (the Blue Star Line, created in 1911), cold-storage facilities and
     an enormous chain of butchers’ shops (till 1995) in Britain.*! The
     Vestey firm was an early case of one of the least recognised features of
    twentieth-century international trade, that much of it took place not
    between nations, but within firms.
      The oldest plant was taken over by the government and supplied the
     local market, while the Swift, Armour and Fray Bentos plants exported
     their products. How was the killing done? We have a description by a
     refrigeration engineer of the workings of the Fray Bentos plant in the
     interwar years. The killing was carried out in an approximately square,
     three-storey building, 30m long on each side. The cattle walked up a
    ramp to the third floor, where they were stunned with pole-axes, and
     then hung on a conveyor, had their throats cut and were bled. They
     were then taken off the conveyor and skinned, after which they were
    hauled up on to the rail once more for further processing. The hides
    and offal went down chutes, the offal to the first floor, and the hides

```
  to the ground. The carcass was cut in half, and the sides of beef then
  travelled down a 100m inclined and enclosed ramp to the four-storey
  chilling plant on the water’s edge. From the chilling plant, the sides
  went by covered way into the holds of the refrigerated ship.”” But there
  was much else going on, for every bit of the animal was used, and
  some 40 per cent in weight was removed to make what is called a
  ‘dressed’ carcass; this was turned into a wide range of products, from
  brushes to pharmaceuticals.
   The killing rate in the frigorifico was extraordinary, especially if we
  remember it was done by stunning with a pole-axe and then cutting
  the throat with a knife. Through much of the twentieth century
  Uruguay slaughtered 1 million head of cattle per annum, mostly in
  the four plants. In the 1930s the Anglo in Fray Bentos dispatched 200
  an hour.*’ According to Upton Sinclair, one Chicago plant was already
  killing twice that thirty years earlier. Fifteen to twenty beef cattle were
  stunned with a pole-axe every minute, and then killed: 400 to 500.an
  hour, around 4,000 a day.
   These giant meatpackers were unknown in the Old World; they
  were found only in the River Plate, the USA and Oceania. European
  slaughterhouses, often municipally owned, as in the case of La Villette
  in Paris, were spaces where many butchers could work, killing their
  own cattle on a small scale, for local consumption.” British slaugh-
  terhouses were tiny, supplied local markets and were not known for
  humane treatment of animals.*° Even the new interwar municipal
  abattoir in Sheffield, which had [a ] [monopoly ] [of ] [killing ] [in ] [its ] [area, ]
  dealt with only 600 cattle a week.” [The ] [point ][was ] [not ] [that ] [Britain ] [was ]

  Killing animals in the long boom and after
  In 1906 Sinclair described ‘a line of dangling hogs a hundred yards

```

```
     in length; and for every yard there was a man, working as if a
    demon was after him’2* Here was a disassembly line that would
     within a few years inspire the assembly lines of another American
     town, Detroit. Henry Ford himself recalled that “The idea came in
     a general way from the overhead trolley that the Chicago packers
     use in dressing beef?” Just as importantly, the Chicago meatpackers
     suggested the mechanical handling of things, and the use of gravity
     to pull things down through buildings, which Henry Ford also used
     on a large scale.*” The new world did indeed pioneer both mass
     killing and mass production. But both would spread and grow par-
     ticularly strongly in the long boom.
      The second half of the twentieth century saw huge increases in
     world production of meat, and the generalisation of mass killing.
     Annual global production increased from 71 million tonnes in 1960,
     rising to nearly 240 million at the end of the century. Per head of pop-
     ulation meat consumption nearly doubled over the period. It could
     easily increase a good deal further as the global average consumption
      is only about a third of the meat consumption of the richest countries.
    Much of the change in meat eating in the twentieth century has come
     from increasing consumption of chicken and pork; they provide two-
     thirds of all the meat consumed today compared to one half in 1970.
      Killing for meat takes place on a scale difficult to comprehend.
     Britain alone killed 883 million animals for food per annum at the end
     of the century, made up of 792 million chickens, 35 million turkeys, 18
     million ducks, 18.7 million sheep, 16.3 million pigs, around 3 million
      cattle, 1 million geese, 10,000 deer and 9,000 goats. The United States
      kills 8 billion chickens a year. In some cases the sheer scale of killing
    demanded new technologies of killing, including electric stunning
     and killing (with tongs for pigs and sheep), and gassing with carbon
     dioxide for pigs. In the case of chickens the change has been extraor-
     dinary. Chickens were killed on automated lines from the 1970s. They
     were strung up by the legs on a conveyor, and their heads dipped
     into a conducting solution. A current passing through their bodies
     stunned them before their necks were cut. Those not despatched by

```

```
  the machine are killed by a human being. They are then plucked and
  gutted by machine, and chilled. The whole process takes two hours.
  The largest chicken slaughterhouses now process 1 million birds per
  week.” This scale of chicken-killing is unimaginable by other means.
  It is difficult to envisage British local butchers and householders
  handling and killing 2 million chickens every day of the year.
   In the case of beef, the technologies of killing would hardly change
  at all from one end of the century to the next — the big changes were
  the introduction of the captive-bolt pistol to replace the pole-axe
  and the chain-saw to replace the axe.** In the years after the Second
  World War, however, the vast New World slaughterhouses of the early
  part of the century went out of fashion, and much smaller and more
  dispersed operations took over. The great plants of the River Plate and
  Chicago closed. The old Anglo plant in Fray Bentos struggled into the
  19708, long enough to be preserved as a museum, the appropriately
  named Museum of the Industrial Revolution, a place which figures
  in tourist guides to the Southern Cone. European self-sufficiency in
  meat, particularly in the British case, and the rise of the Common
  Market, which de-globalised the trade in meat, put paid to it. In the
  USA the great meatpackers of Chicago lost markets to new rural, non-
  unionised, low-skill, single-storey meatpackers, which sent out boxed
  meat to supermarkets instead of sides of beef to butchers (and of
  course to the new giant mass producers of beefburgers and the like).
   Since the 1970s, and especially the 1980s, new plants and new meat-
  packers, more concentrated even than those of Chicago’s prime,
  appeared. Four new meatpackers killed more than 80 per cent of US
  meat at the end of the century.*’ In 2001 the world’s largest chicken
  producer, Tyson Foods, took over the biggest meat producer, IBP. IBP
  is, it claims, ‘the largest provider of protein products on the planet’.
  It employs 114,000 workers and has sales of $26 billion. Although the
  methods of slaughtering and processing cattle remains essentially
  the same, the rate of killing has been pushed up: plants in the 1980s
  slaughtered 175 an hour, rising to 400 an hour, down a single line.**
  These large plants, located in such states as Nebraska, Kansas, Texas

```
     and Colorado (in that order) were also everywhere once again staffed
     by immigrants, now Latino and Asian.» The end of the unionised
     workforce meant not only a radical speeding up in production, but
     decreasing real wages. And, just as had also been the case when Sinclair
     wrote, the new meat industry had enormous political power.
    Executions and other killings
     In judicial killing respect for tradition is felt to be appropriate. Until
     they abolished capital punishment well after the Second World War,
     the British relied on the gallows, the Spanish on the garrotte, the
     French on the guillotine. Many continued using the firing squad, and
     the twentieth century saw plenty of beheadings and stonings too.
      The United States showed a remarkable appetite for developing new
     means of execution. In the 1880s, when the state of New York looked
     for new ways of executing its errant citizens, they came up with thirty-
     four possible methods, and four real contenders — gallows, garrotte,
     guillotine and firing squad. They liked none, for they mutilated the
    body of the deceased, and in some cases had unfortunate political
     associations. Two new methods were suggested — electrocution and
     lethal injection. The first was chosen, with the assistance of Thomas
     Edison, who ensured that alternating current, and not his own direct
     current, was used. In 1889 the first victim was killed in New York. By
      1915, twenty-five American states had the technology. But innovation
     did not stop there. In 1924 the gas chamber was introduced in Nevada,
     and its use too spread quickly. Hydrogen cyanide was the killing gas,
     produced by the simple means of dropping a bag of sodium cyanide
     into dilute sulphuric acid. The lethal injection was innovated in Texas
      im19gs2.°°
      Once introduced, a given killing machine lasted for a very long
     time. Thus the gas chambers, mostly installed in the 1920s and 1930s,
     were still in use in the 1980s and 1990s, and very old electric chairs
     remained in use for decades too, until — like many gas chambers — they
     became too troublesome to maintain. The last gassing was in 1999.7”
     Gas chambers were replaced by lethal-injection machines, which were

```

-----

```
  much cheaper than designing and building a new gas chamber or
  electric chair. Another factor was that in some US states those to be
  executed were given a choice and most seem to have gone for lethal
  Injection.
   Lethai injection has spread around the world, just as earlier, colonial
  powers took their execution technologies to their colonies.** At the end
  of the twentieth century the Philippines introduced lethal injection; it
  had wanted gas chambers, but none could be bought. China began to
  use lethal injection in the 1990s, Taiwan allowed its use but continued
  shooting, and Guatemala adopted it. In Thailand the machine gun
  replaced beheading in the 1930s; it has recently been replaced by lethal
  injection.
   Despite the progressive change towards lethal injection, the
  twentieth century saw expansion in the use of older techniques. The
  guillotine, perhaps the first killing technique devised to minimise
  pain to the executed, came into use in the French Revolution. Asso-
  ciated with the beheading of nobles and the Terror, it was to have a
  gruesome future. In the nineteenth century a number of European
  nations adopted it, including many German states. The new German
  Reich beheaded all its capital offenders from 1870, though not all
  by guillotine; some states retained the axe, until it was abolished in
  1936. But the execution rate was, as elsewhere, but a handful a year.
  The great age of the guillotine was about to begin again. Under the
  Nazis the execution rate increased drastically — in the Nazi era some
  10,000 people were executed after a judicial process, peaking at many
  thousands per year during the war. Hitler is reported to have ordered
  twenty guillotines. He introduced hanging as an alternative in 1942,
  using very crude gallows.
   In most places judicial execution was a rare occurrence, and from
  the 1940s would become rarer still. It was regarded in most of the
  rich world as a barbarous practice which should be abolished. In the
  United States, some 120 people were executed ever year in the interwar
  years. By the 1960s there were [few ] [executions, ] [and ] [between ] [1972 ] [and ]
  1976 there were none for technical [legal ] [reasons. ] [Elsewhere ] [too ] [the ]

```

```
     number of executions generally fell, and many countries abolished the
     death penalty altogether.
      The United States in particular deviated from this trend. Executions
     resumed in 1977, with the killing by firing squad of Gary Gilmore in
     Utah. But far from continuing on a downward path the number of
     executions surged in the 1980s and 1990s. Texas, using lethal injection,
     executed forty in the year 2000, leading the way back to capital pun-
     ishment levels in the USA not seen since the 1950s. Although lethal
     injection dominated, the gas chamber and the electric chair returned
      to use.
      The application of capital punishment has never been merely a
     judicial matter. The noose, electric chair and lethal injection were not
     neutral. Politics and race have mattered a very great deal. In Britain
     around twelve people a year were hanged in the twentieth century, yet
     the British judicially hanged over 1,000 Kenyans between 1952 and 1959
     (and killed tens of thousands by other means) during the Mau Mau
      rebellion. Between 1608 and 1972 only 41 per cent of those executed in
     the USA were white, despite it being an overwhelmingly white nation;
      since 1930 more than half of all those executed have been black.*? In
     some southern states the fall in lynchings of blacks in the early part
     of the century merely led to a rise in state executions of blacks.” Only
     since the reintroduction of capital punishment has the number of
     executed whites slightly exceeded the number of blacks.
     Technologies of genocide
     At certain times, in certain places, governments have sought to eliminate
     particular populations, or simply kill large numbers of people. In doing
      so they were sometimes forced to think about methods of killing, and
     sometimes to innovate in killing techniques. For example, in the Great
     War the Ottoman Empire decided to deport its very large Armenian
     Christian population from its central Anatolian territories. It was at
     war with Christian Russia and Armenia was on the Ottoman—Russian
     border. The deportations were themselves brutal forced marches with
    much death and killing on the way. The process did not stop until the

```

```
  creation in 1923 of a Turkish state in Anatolia, now free not only of
  Armenians but of Greek Orthodox peoples too. It is estimated that
  around 1.5 million Armenians died. Other massacres were small by
  comparison. In the Soviet Union, during the Great Terror of the mid-
  1930s, hundreds of thousands were executed by shooting. In a few
  weeks after their capture of Nanking in December 1937, the Japanese
  killed, it is roughly estimated, some 100-300,000 Chinese soldiers and
  civilians, mostly by shooting.
   It was the Germans who innovated, under cover of secrecy and
  war. Using conventional means — shooting, hanging, starving — the
  horse-drawn German forces killed many millions in Eastern Europe
  between 1941 and 1945, including millions of civilians. The first large-
  scale killing of Jews, in what had been eastern Poland and the Soviet
  Union, used conventional means. Four specially created and remark-
  ably small killing squads, Einsatzgruppen, together with local accom-
  plices, killed around 1.3 million Jews with small arms.*! Soon the
  Einsatzgruppen began to use gas vans on a small scale, but even the
  small number of these (around thirty is the largest estimate) could
  kill many thousands a day. Indeed the first mass-killing operation,
  using just three gas lorries, started in Chelmno in late 1941, taking
  roughly 1,000 lives a day. From December 1941 until early 1943 around
  300,000 were killed. In 1942 three more extermination centres were
  established — Sobibor, Belzec and Treblinka. With Chelmno, they were
  responsible for the deaths of around 2 million people. Treblinka was
  the largest, killing around three-quarters of a million people. All these
  were small places, deep in the forest, and all were destroyed by the
  Germans, mostly by 1943. They killed using carbon monoxide from
  engine exhausts. Its advantage was not that it killed faster — it was that
  it spared dedicated squads of killers the grisly task of killing directly.”
  This carbon-monoxide killing technology had already been used to
  kill tens of thousands of mentally and physically handicapped Aryans
  by 1941.
   It is telling that our central image of the Holocaust is not one of
  small arms and engine exhausts, [though ] [these ] [and ] [hunger ] [were ] [the ]

      great killers. It involves a large industrial site, a specialised killing
      gas, Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide), and industrial-scale crematoria
      to dispose of bodies. The one major killing site using these means,
     Auschwitz-Birkenau, killed more than any other single place, around
       1 million. There were survivors, and indeed much of the camp itself
     remained. For these and other reasons it was not typical. Auschwitz-
     Birkenau, the last extermination centre to come on line, and the last
       to operate, was not a pure extermination camp. It was an enormous
     labour camp, supplying manpower, with other camps in the area, for
      a vast new Upper Silesian industrial complex in territory incorporated
      into the Reich. Auschwitz-Birkenau was intended at one point to bea
     camp for the extraordinary number of 200,000 inmates.
      Zyklon B was used in Auschwitz, as elsewhere in the Nazi camp
     system, to disinfect clothes to keep lice-born disease under control.
     There it was found that it could kill people effectively too. Two
     houses were turned into gas chambers, and the designs of projected
      large morgues attached to crematoria, intended for the disposal of
      the bodies of the many who died from hunger and disease, were
     changed to convert them into gas chambers.** By this twisted road was
     Auschwitz-Birkenau created as an extermination camp with a novel
      killing technology.
      One of the great industrial enterprises the camps supplied with
     labour were new plants belonging to IG Farben. The company was
     building, for the first time contiguously, plant for synthetic oil and
     rubber, and for many other intermediate and final products, exploit-
     ing the inter-relatedness of the processes. This major undertaking
     never produced oil or rubber but it did manufacture other materials
     of importance for the war effort. The conjunction tempts us to see
     connections with the Holocaust; both were linked to a resurgent
     German nationalism. Treating Auschwitz as if it was a killing factory,
      in the same way that Leuna or Leverkusen were chemical factories or
     Krupps in Essen an armament maker, is to miss other crucial aspects.
     The Auschwitz-Birkenau killing facilities were neither very large,
     automated nor smooth running, nor especially capital-intensive.

```

-----

```
  The crematoria often broke down, and many bodies were buried or
  burned in pits. They worked intermittently as the supply of victims
  was variable. The greatest killing spree of all, that of Hungary’s Jews,
  which took around two months, was too much for the existing
  capacity, and needed extra killing, and especially incineration, facili-
  ties. Great sloping pits were built, with firewood as fuel. Furthermore
  the path that led to adapting lice-killing technology to humans and
  the steps that led to the processes for the manufacture of synthetic oil
  and rubber were very different.
   The image of Auschwitz as a radically modern factory of death
  nevertheless remains powerful. It has served as a strong critique of
  modernity in general, as a stark reminder of where modern science
  and industry could lead. It has helped fuel a retrospective debate as
  to whether Auschwitz should have been bombed, as if it were a great
  machine susceptible to destruction, such as a synthetic-oil plant or a
  V-2 factory.
   Simple though horrifying calculations make clear that although
  killing 2 million people in a year seems to be a stupefying task, it was
  well within the capabilities of much older killing technology. The
  four large slaughterhouses of small Uruguay could dispatch 1 million
  cattle a year with nothing more elaborate than a pole-axe and knife;
  Chicago’s largest were doing this even before the Great War. And, as
  we have seen, small arms and car exhaust took a terrible toll. Large-
  scale killing was not as new, nor as difficult, as the technological medi-
  tations on the Holocaust suggested.
   The nature and power of the killing machines at Auschwitz in par-
  ticular have been at the centre of the claims of Holocaust deniers.
  Much of the denier case is that it is inconceivable that so many people
  could be killed in gas chambers, a few gas vans and with rifles. In this
  sordid story a genuine expert on killing technology, Fred A. Leuchter
  Jr, a maintenance and repair man for execution equipment, became a
  central figure.“ Mr Death, as Errol Morris called his brilliant film on
  Leuchter, made a modest career in the United States reconditioning
  and remodelling execution equipment [after ] [executions ] [resumed ]

```
      there in 1977. Leuchter renovated gallows for Delaware, and improved
      a gas chamber for Missouri.** He also invented an automatic lethal
     injection machine for New Jersey. As perhaps the only living expert
     on gas chambers, Leuchter was hired in 1988 to testify on behalf of
      a Holocaust denier — a nice illustration of the role of maintenance
     man as expert. He visited Auschwitz, and convinced himself that there
     were no gas chambers there. His report became a key document in
     the Holocaust denier’s armoury. Holocaust denial, more accurately
     gas chamber denial, has led to research that shows in surprising detail
     how the SS built and used the gas chambers, weakening even further
     the denier case.*°
       If in innovation-centric history too much is made of Auschwitz, the
     Holocaust was nevertheless novel. Following the Holocaust genocides
     cannot be considered a throwback to earlier barbarity, however
     tempting that line of argument remains. There have been modern
     motivations, and planning, and in an already established pattern, the
     use of existing tools in new ways. This is clear in two later, smaller
     genocides.
       In Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979 some 1.7 million people were
     killed by the Pol Pot regime before it was defeated by the Vietnamese.
     Some 20 per cent of the population died, with the urban and rural
     Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai minorities being especially affected.”
     Enforced starvation was the main cause of death, but some 200,000
     were executed, according to one estimate. They were killed in many
     places and by a variety of methods: shooting, skulls bashed in with
     shovels, hoes and iron bars, and — an innovation — suffocation with a
     plastic bag.
       In 1994 central Africa was the scene of a spectacularly fast genocide.
     At least 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis (some estimates put the figure as
     high as 1 million), the minority population, were killed, 99 per cent
     between April and December.” Most victims were killed by machete
     (38 per cent), clubs (17 per cent) with firearms accounting for only
      15 per cent of deaths.” The Hutu government had even acquired
     machetes in advance. In 1993 alone around 1 million machetes,

```

```
  weighing around 500 tons and costing less than a US dollar each, were
  imported, around one machete for every three males in the country.”!
  This was something new — never before had so many been killed so
  quickly by machete, which appeared as a major killing machine for
  the first time in history. Invention happens at unexpected times and
  places.

              Invention
     Since the Second World War, in the Anglophone world, technology
     has come to be closely identified with invention. This conflation has
     been unhelpful to the understanding of technology and has also had
     negative effects on our understanding of invention. We do not have
      a history of invention, but instead histories of the invention of only
     some of the technologies which were later successful. That in itself
     biases our understanding. But the history of inventions we have is
      itself innovation-centric. It focuses on (some) aspects of what is new
     in invention, and it highlights changes in invention, not what does
     not change.
      The innovation-centric picture comes in a number of different
     versions. One focuses on inventions in academic scientific research;
     another on what are taken to be the crucial technologies; yet another
     looks at what are taken to be the most novel inventing organisations.
     Very often an overall argument is made that as time has passed novelty
     has itself become ever more novel. Each of these images, while it has
     some points in its favour, deserves to be challenged. One of the most
     important and interesting things about invention is that it exhibits
     important continuities which are insufficiently recognised, and indeed
     that it has changed in ways we do not sufficiently appreciate. Prolific
     invention has been with us for a long time — novelty is not new, but
     there are new things to say about it.

```

```
  Academic science and invention
  The academic research picture focuses on what it takes to be the most
  important and innovative aspects of science, and claims that crucial
  inventions which then shape our world derive from them. Implicit in
   this view is the argument that something called ‘science’ has become,
  since the late nineteenth century, the main source of technologies.
  What is meant by ‘science’ is something very particular. Just as tech-
  nology and invention are conflated, so are science and research. The
  twentieth-century belief that “Science implies the breaking of new
  ground’ has made science research.' But just as most engineers are
   not inventors, and most scientists are not researchers, so most science
   is not research.
   Even the research that is referred to when ‘science is used, is usually
  only a small part of all scientific research — that done in universities
   or similar bodies. There is a very particular innovation-centred view
  of academic research, which privileges organic chemistry and electric-
  ity in the nineteenth century, nuclear physics in the first half of the
  twentieth century, and molecular biology since the 1950s. From these
  particular academic researches, come, implicitly and explicitly, world-
  changing technologies — synthetic chemistry, electricity, the atomic
  bomb and biotechnology. The list will by now be familiar. Indeed, our
  standard picture of what is important in the history of invention in
  academic research has been profoundly affected by what are taken to
  be the most important technologies of the century.
   Only a tiny proportion of twentieth-century academic research was
  in particle physics and molecular biology. These branches of physics
  and biology did not even dominate those fields, let alone academic
  research as a whole. One of the most striking omissions is chemistry,
  the largest academic science for most of the century; others are
  academic engineering and medicine. In these sectors too, the constant
  generation of novelty became the rule in rapidly expanding univer-
   sities. Most novel university research has been in what are wrongly
  taken to be ‘old’ subjects.
    In any case new subjects of research in universities derived from

     older practices. The university was keeping up with a changing tech-
     nological world rather than creating it: there was flight before there
     was aeronautical engineering; there was photography long before any
     theory of the photographic process; there was any amount of highly
     specialised metal manufacture before metallurgy; and solid-state
     devices existed before solid-state physics. Industrial firms, not uni-
     versities, pioneered the scientific study of photography, metallurgy
     and the semi-conductor; the academy followed.
      The relations between the world of practice and invention in the
    academy have long been close. For all the talk of ivory towers, academic
     science, engineering and medicine have been closely connected to
     industry, as well as the state, since at least the late nineteenth century.
     The great German organic chemistry centres in the universities had
     close links with German industry before and after the Great War.
     Fritz Haber, of the Haber-Bosch process, was an academic. Academic
     experts on coal and in chemistry were involved in coal hydrogenation.
    The University of Goettingen was an important centre of aeronautical
     research before the Great War. Penicillin was spun-off from St Mary’s
     Medical School and the University of Oxford in the 1940s. MIT set
     up a spin-off arm before the Second World War. Stanford was also
     spinning out in the 1930s — its Klystron microwave generator became
     the first great product of what much later would be Silicon Valley.
      Yet historically-ignorant analysts insist that only in the last two
     decades have the barriers between the academy and industry been
    broken down with the creation of great entrepreneurial universities.
     These are only now, it is claimed, driving the creation of new indus-
     tries. Not only is the novelty of this greatly exaggerated, so is its sig-
     nificance. At the beginning of the twenty-first century US universities
     and hospitals were receiving around $1 billion worth of licence (largely
     royalty) income from their intellectual property per annum. That is a
    huge sum, but needs to be kept in proportion. The largest recipients
     got no more than tens of millions of dollars, with most of the money
    coming from a very few patents in the medical field, a notable case
    being Florida State University’s patent related to the cancer drug Taxol.

  It was far from self-financing. Most university patents were the result
  of huge public investments in academic research. The Bayh—Dole Act
  of 1980 was critical in that it gave universities intellectual property
  rights on the results of federally funded research. The universities
  and hospitals were spending some $30—4obn on research per annum,
  some $20-25bn funded by the federal government, with the balance
  coming from industry, local and state governments and the institu-
  tions themselves. The big story in US academic research continues
  to be what it has been since the Second World War: federal research
  funds, military and civil. For all the emphasis on private health care in
  the USA, the federal government has played a massive role in funding
  academic medical research, one which has increased very significantly
  in the past decade.
   Academics have wanted funding to be provided by government,
  and to be independent of funding directly concerned with invention
  and development, which was largely a matter for industry.” That there
  is a particularly widespread belief in the significance of academic
  science as a source of invention is testimony to the great influence of
  academic research scientists. There are indeed cases where academic
  research has led to new technologies. Many examples are given, but not
  all are convincing. Good ones would be X-rays and atomic weapons;
  poor ones, the cavity magnetron and the laser. The cavity magnetron,
  which generates high-power high-frequency radio waves, was used
  before academics studied it. The laser was the product of academic
  research guided and stimulated by the US military.
   The great bulk of invention — let alone the development of inven-
  tions — takes place, and always has done — a long way from univer-
  sity research laboratories, and no serious analyst of invention ever
  believed otherwise. Most invention has taken place in the world of use
  (including many radical inventions) and furthermore has been under
  the direct control of users. It has been the realm of the individual
  inventor, the laboratories, workshops and design centres of industrial
  firms, and the laboratories, workshops and design centres of govern-
  ments, and especially their armed forces.’

     Stage models of invention
     One important myth is that invention is highly concentrated in partic-
     ular areas where the most radical inventions happen. These are taken
     to be the technologies which are thought to shape particular historical
     eras. In the case of industrial technology, invention is thought to be
     concentrated in electricals and chemicals in the first half of the century,
     giving way to electronics and rockets, and then to computers and bio-
     technology. In recent years one could be forgiven for believing that
     there was no invention going on outside information and biotechnol-
     ogy. There is evidence of shifts in inventive effort between areas over
     time, and to a lesser extent of changes in inventive output over time,
     but it does not correspond to the stages suggested. Inventive effort in
     electricity and chemicals not only persisted, but radically expanded
     in the twentieth century. So did invention in mechanical engineering.
     However, the proportion devoted to rockets and electronics undoubt-
     edly grew in the 1950s and 1960s and it undoubtedly shrunk in the last
     decades of the century. It is the case that within industry life-sciences
     research, whether in pharmaceuticals or agriculture, has increased
     while heavy-chemicals research has fallen. That has happened even
     within particular firms.
      Perhaps the most powerful proof of the importance of the old is
     that the largest private spenders on research and development at the
     end of the twentieth century were not computer giants, or even phar-
     maceutical firms, but motor-car producers — General Motors and the
     Ford Motor Company top the list, not Microsoft or Novartis (see Table
      8.1, p. 204). The cost of design of a new car at the end of the twentieth
     century was around £100—500 million and about the same for a new
     car engine. It is in the same range as a new drug. Of course, it may be
     that research and development in these areas is expensive because to
    produce anything worthwhile, one needs to puta lot in. In other areas
     the returns may be much larger, and technical change much swifter.
     Micro-electronics may be the key case.
      There is no doubt that there has been a belief that technical progress
     has concentrated in particular areas, but it is hard to untangle whether

    24. John Garand, employee of the US Federal Armoury at Springfield, and inventor
   of the US Army’s semi-automatic rifle, the M-1, at work in his model shop. The M-1
   was the standard US infantry rifle of the Second World War. Mechanical inventions
   by employees of corporations and governments, and by private individuals, remain a
        significant proportion of all patents in the twenty-first century.
  this is because a lot of effort is devoted to it, or because it is produc-
  tive. There is an old Soviet joke which goes to the heart of the issue: an
  inventor goes to the ministry and says: ‘I have invented a new button-
  holing machine for our clothing industry. “Comrade, says the minister,
  ‘we have no use for your machine: don’t you realise this is the age of
  the Sputnik?”* Such sentiments shaped policy, not only in rockets, and
  not only in the Soviet Union. Planners hope to focus invention and
  development on what they take to be the ‘cutting edge’, or some other
  similar cliché, of technological advance. Much more has been invested
  by governments in invention in aviation than in shipping, or in nuclear
  power than other energy technologies. Of course military imperatives
  to build rockets and nuclear stations, subsequently justified by claims

     about their general technological fecundity, for example in the notion
     of spin-off, were important. Yet behind the spin-off argument was a
     key hidden assumption that spin-off happens only in what are consid-
     ered advanced technologies. We believe that spin-off from rockets is
     more likely and more significant than from button-holing machines.
      So powerful is the idea that important invention is confined to new
     technologies, that a special concept was used to explain innovation in
     old industries. It was the ‘sailing ship effect’. This is the argument that
     firms in old industries innovated only in response to new technology
     that threatened their survival. The examples given, all nineteenth-
     century ones, are: the sailing ship improving after the introduction
     of steam; the development of the Welsbach mantle for gas lights,
     which followed the introduction of electricity; and improvements in
     the Leblanc process for making alkali, following the introduction of
     the Solvay process. However, in all these cases there is no evidence
     that invention was not happening anyway in the ‘old’ industry.° In
     some instances there may indeed be a sailing ship effect. The speed up
     in invention in condoms and other forms of contraception after the
     introduction of the Pill is a case. But it may be explained by the special
     circumstances of the industry.
      Invention and innovation have been happening everywhere. Agri-
     culture has been an important site of invention and development
     activity, with the devising of new agricultural practices as well as many
     new plant varieties, such as IR8, the new dwarf rice introduced in
     1966 by the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines.
     Intensive development led to new animal hybrids (for example, in the
     case of chickens) and husbandry practices such as the use of growth-
    promoting antibiotics. The declining British cotton industry and
    government supported research and development in the growing of
     cotton, and the manufacture of cotton goods, on a large and increas-
     ing scale from the 1920s. In the early decades of the twentieth century
     the largest single corporate research project in the USA may well
     have been the American Tobacco Company’s development of a cigar-
    making machine.® Armed forces paid for research and invention in

   small arms and artillery, as well as in aviation and radio. Inventive
   activity in shipping has not only led to much larger ships but to such
  now widespread twentieth-century things as the bulbous bow. Even
  though it was very unfashionable and badly under-resourced, work
   was done for decades after the Second World War on improving the
  performance of steam locomotives.
   By the 1960s it was felt by some that whole areas of technology were
   not receiving the inventive attention they deserved. At its most basic
   there was an argument that too much was spent on aircraft, rockets
   and nuclear power, often labelled ‘prestige’ projects. More should be
   spent, it was argued, on bread and butter research and development,
   on improving electronics, and chemicals, even trains and buses. A par-
   ticularly strong and interesting version of the argument came from the
  economist E. F. Schumacher. He argued for the development of ‘inter-
  mediate technologies’ which would stand between the traditional tech-
   nologies of the poor world, and the capital-intensive large-scale ones
   of the rich world, an idea developed in a famous book called Smal is
   Beautiful (1973). These ideas were very influential, leading to the devel-
  opment, on a small scale and funded by charities, of a very wide range
   of new and improved things. For example, an academic engineer at
   the University of Oxford, Stuart Wilson (1923-2003) developed an
   improved cycle-rickshaw, called the “Oxtrike’. It was designed to be
   more efficient that the standard rickshaw, and also to be easily manu-
   factured in small workshops in the poor world. Yet it, like many such
   technologies, did not diffuse around the poor world to any great extent.
  There was suspicion of such technologies as second-rate technologies.
  Why should not poor countries have the best, they asked?
    There is a great difference between invention for the poor world
  and invention in the poor world. The invention and development
  taking place outside the world of western NGOs was surely much
  more significant than these efforts. Although not recorded in patents
   or copyrights, it too is important, changing the material structure of
   the world, for example in the case of the poor mega-city, the work of
  millions of untutored architects, engineers and builders.

    New inventive institutions
    The third kind of account focuses on telling the story of successive
    kinds of inventive organisation. In essence, it goes like this. In the
    heroic period of the industrial revolution invention was the work of
    individual inventors. From the late nineteenth century science and
    technology came together, and invention became the province of the
    corporate research laboratory, particularly in electricity and chemicals.
    By the 1970s and 1980s the key inventive institution had become the
    biotechnology and information technology start-up, the science park
    and the entrepreneurial university. Again, there is something in the
     story, but the timings and the substance are very misleading.
     Take the timing. Around 1900 there is little doubt that a majority of
    patents were still granted to individual inventors. Only as the century
    progressed did significant proportions of patents go to large firms.
    Corporate research laboratories and state organisations, while active
    around 1900, really came into their own only after 1945. Since then, the
    individual inventor has not disappeared — he (for invention has been
     a very masculine activity) has operated in a new context. Nor indeed
    has the large corporate inventor. One of the most striking features of
     the history of invention is the long lives of inventing organisations.
     Around 1900 one could see an important change within some indus-
     tries and some firms as to how they organised some of their inventive
     activity. ‘Research’ was established in firms for the first time, to sup-
    plement the existing scientific and engineering work.’ A majority of
     scientists and engineers continued to be employed in routine jobs, in
    production, in analytical labs and in development labs.
     The first research revolution in industry was not, as used to be
    thought, derivative of a research-centred academy, a kind of applica-
     tion in industry of an academic model. It was the result of a revolution
     that was taking place slowly but simultaneously in industry, govern-
    ment and the academy. In each a new research-focused science and
    engineering emerged. Universities went from being teaching institu-
    tions to teaching and research institutions (as did medical schools);
    government scientists and engineers became concerned not just with

  building roads, or enforcing, say, food standards, but also creating
  new knowledge and new things.*
   Research organisations were typically created in firms which were
  already large and technologically progressive, indeed often dominant
  in their field. The German synthetic dye firms, such as BASF, Hoechst,
  Bayer and AGFA, were well-established world leaders in synthetic
  dyes when they introduced research laboratories. Bayer did so in 1891,
  and only 20 per cent of its chemists were in research by the early
  part of the new century. In the United States the research revolu-
  tion was led by even larger firms. The first case usually cited is the
  1900 establishment of the General Electric Laboratory. Other signifi-
  cant research laboratories were established by the explosives firm Du
  Pont (1902 and 1903), telephone company AT&T (around 1911, when
   a research branch was added to the engineering department of its
  manufacturing arm, Western Electric), and the photographic giant
  Eastman Kodak (c. 1912). All these firms were already very large, inno-
  vative in ‘science-based’ technologies, and employed an abundance
  of scientists and engineers. Kodak and General Electric were already
  powerful multinational enterprises, leading the world photographic
  and electrical industries. AT&T dominated American telephony and
  telegraphy.
   One of the main factors leading to the establishment of research in
  these firms was potential threats to their dominance from European
  innovations. These innovations were not themselves the product of
  industrial research. Eastman Kodak felt threatened by the Lumiére
  brothers’ Autochrome process, which produced beautiful colour
  images. GE was concerned about a radically different kind of electric
  light invented by the German academic chemist Walter Nernst. His
  lamp was made of a material which conducted electricity and glowed
  when hot. It could be lit with a match. The rights had been acquired
  by the German electrical firm AEG, and they made Nernst a rich man.
  The lamp was to have only modest success, mostly in micro markets.
  One such was in the first successful [photoelectric ] [fax ][machines, ] [which ]
  were designed by Arthur Korn and [in ][use ] [before ] [the ] [First ] [World ] [War. ]

       25. One of the world’s great centres of invention, the Bayer works at Leverkusen, c. 1947.
       It was a great centre for the production of dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and much else
       besides, from the late nineteenth century to the present. Like many great researching
               corporations it is older than most nation-states.
    AT&T feared radio would undercut its telephone business; radio was
     the work of individual European inventors, among them Guglielmo
     Marconi.
      Industrial research would prove to be one of the factors that kept
     these firms dominant for decades, hence the familiarity of their names.
     The main research laboratories of General Electric and Du Pont are
      still where they were established more than one hundred years ago.
     At least fifteen out of the twenty-three firms listed as the top R&D
     spenders in 1997 (and 2003) were formed before 1914, and of these at
     least five were important in industrial research. Of course there were

```

-----

```
  new entrants to the top ranks, and they include Japanese car and elec-
  trical firms in particular.
   The great industrial research centres founded around 1900 had a
  history of expansion. Before the Great War Du Pont spent around 1
  per cent of its turnover on R&D, going up to 3 per cent in the interwar
  years. Between the 1950s and 1970s it was at 7 per cent of a much larger
  company. At the end of the 1960s Du Pont declared its programme
  of development of new products from its own research an expensive
  failure. In the 1970s it cut back on its R&D expenditures, and short-
  range work on existing products was emphasised. By 1975 the research
  intensity fell to 4.7 per cent, and to 3.6 per cent by 1980. The 1980s
  saw a return of interest in R&D, but largely in the life sciences. Yet Du
  Pont remains among the great spenders. It is still in the list in 1997, but
  because of cuts in research it dropped way down by 2003.
   Another example of long-term dominance is AT&T. Its research
  branch was incorporated into its subsidiary Bell Labs in the 1920s, a
  company which saw quite extraordinary growth and output through
  the twentieth century. It was a world leader in information technology
  from the 1920s and expanded enormously through the 1930s and up to
  the late 1970s. Among its products are the transistor, invented in 1947,
  the UNIX operating system of the 1960s, and the Digital Signal Pro-
  cessing chip in 1979, now ubiquitous in mobile phones and much else.
  Much reduced since by the breakup of AT&T’s telephone monopolies
  and its transfer to Lucent Technologies, it was nevertheless still in the
  top twenty in 1997, well ahead of, for example, Intel. Since then it has
  shrunk enormously, but it is still bigger than it was in the mid-1920s.
   The development of the transistor and the integrated circuit in the
  1950S, 1960s and 1970s was in part the work of entrepreneurial small
  firms. Transistor development and production were quickly taken by
  Bell staff to smaller and newer enterprises. Texas Instruments, with a
  former Bell employee, made the first silicon transistor in 1955. William
  Schockley, one of the inventors of the transistor, set up a semiconduc-
  tor firm in California. Experts left to form Fairchild Semiconductor
  in 1957, the company that introduced the key planar process for the

```

-----

```
     making of integrated circuits. Fairchild and Texas Instruments were
     granted key patents in 1959. Fairchild employees set up most of the
     new semiconductor enterprises of the 1960s, largely in the area that
     became known as Silicon Valley, which had since the 1930s welcomed
     new industries and had strong connections to new universities and,
      critically, the expanding US military. Among the new semiconductor
     enterprises was Intel (1968), which introduced the microprocessor, the
     computer on the chip, in 1971.
      The great firms in information-technology invention today are
      a mixture of ancient firms, and start-ups of decades ago: Siemens,
     IBM, Microsoft, Nokia, Hitachi and Intel (see Table 8.1, p. 204). They
     have R&D budgets only ever exceeded by those above them in the list
     today. In semiconductors and software the age when the small entre-
     preneurial university-linked start-up was crucial was the 1950s, 1960s
     and 1970s, not the later period when they were supposedly dominant.
     Hitachi and Siemens were both formed before the Great War, as of
     course was Bell Labs. But perhaps the most telling case is Interna-
     tional Business Machines (IBM), for decades synonymous with the
     computer, from the mainframe to the PC. Even before the Great War
      it was a huge force in calculating machines around the world. In the
     1940s and 1950s it still led, now in electro-mechanical machines. In
     the 1950s an MIT engineer designed a vast computerised system for
     US air defence, project SAGE. The contract to build these machines
     was given to IBM, despite it not having any experience of electronic
     computers. From this IBM would become, unexpectedly, the leading
     force in electronic computing, especially with the launch of System
     360 in the early 1960s. It remains a major R&D spender.
      In the case of biotechnology too, the boom in pharmaceutical
     research has been led by gigantic spenders, not by start-ups. And they
     have also been around for a very long time. All the largest spenders
     on R&D in pharmaceuticals/biotechnology are very old firms. Pfizer,
     Johnson and Johnson, Roche, each of the Swiss companies that
     merged to form Novartis (Ciba, Geigy, Sandoz) and those that merged
      to form Aventis (Hoechst and Rhone Poulenc) were all founded in the

```

```
  nineteenth century, as were all the parts of Glaxosmithkline (Glaxo,
  Wellcome, Smith, Kline French, Beechams, Allen & Hanbury). Not all,
  but many, were important in pharmaceutical research and production
  before 1914. The start-ups of the 1970s and 1980s are well behind.
   Although the big car companies which head the list of R&D spenders
  today existed well before the First World War, they were not known
  for R&D until well after the Second, with the partial exception of
  General Motors. They did little research, yet they were very inventive.
  The Model T launched in 1908 was a new kind of car: it was a sturdy,
  light, cheap vehicle, well adapted for use in the countryside. It did not
  come out of a laboratory, but from a small firm. By January 1910 Ford
  moved into a vast new concrete and glass factory at Highland Park,
  with its own palatial power station. It employed 3,000 production
  employees in 1910, expanding to over 14,000 by 1913.’ Few of today’s
  fastest-growing companies could match that rate of growth.
    In the car industry, and many others, there were few if any laborato-
  ries, but plenty of development workshops and testing facilities such
   as tracks, wind tunnels and hydrodynamic tanks. Such facilities were
  important in generating much-needed knowledge of things such as
  propellers, hull shapes, aeroplanes and materials. In these places the
  designers and the engineers long held sway. They were trying to achieve
  particular levels of performance, often throughincrementalchange,and
  much design work involved a great deal of calculation and modelling.
   The Second World War brought a radical change in scale in this
  inventive and development activity. Aircraft and aero-engines alone
  were huge elements of post-war R&D, largely funded by the state.
  Alongside this and organised in a similar way were the rocket pro-
  grammes and the development of new computing machines. Decisions
  were made to devote huge resources to particular projects, resulting
  not only in an increase in spending, but in a progressive reduction
  in the number of projects. The DC3 airliner cost around $300,000
  to develop in the late 1930s, while the larger DC4 in the mid-1930s
  took $3.3m; in the 1950s the DC8 cost $112m.'° The cost of aircraft
  development continued to increase, as did that of car development.

     Missiles, short-range and intercontinental, as well as space launchers
     also consumed vast sums in development expenditure.
      The phrase ‘research and development’ became a term of art espe-
     cially around the Second World War in both government and industry.
     It is an unfortunate term, as ‘development and research’ would more
     accurately reflect the fact that development expenditure was much
     larger than research expenditure.
    How does the bomb project fit in?
     In the history of twentieth-century science, technology and invention,
     no project has so central a place as the US atomic bomb project of the
    Second World War (though not the later work). It has profoundly
     affected what we take to be significant in the history of twentieth-
     century science, especially before 1939, and figures as one of the great
     technologies of the middle of the century. It also marks what is regarded
     asahugelyimportant organisationalinnovation inthe history of science
     and technology — the rise of “big science’. It is made unprecedented in
     world history through the discounting of the many precedents that
     existed. Once we put the old into the story, it will look very different.
      Let us start with the name. The use of the term ‘Manhattan Project’
     obscures an important word in its full name, which was ‘Manhattan
     Engineer District’ It was so-called because it was run by the US Army’s
     Corps of Engineers, a prestigious old institution that had long taken
     the best graduates from the West Point military academy. The Corps
     was organised into districts, and they created one for this new project,
     which wasa production, development and research project. In the usual
     stories about big science, its phenomenal cost of $2bn is referred to as
     if this was the cost of the research and development effort, when, in
     fact, most of the $2bn went on the building of two nuclear factories at
    Oak Ridge and Hanford. General Leslie Groves, the head of the project
     and senior member of the US Army Corps of Engineers, had previ-
     ously supervised the building of munitions plants, issuing contracts
    worth much more than the entire cost of the Manhattan Project."!
     Through the war the research and development cost was $70m

    26. The military engineer Brigadier General Leslie Groves was the director of the
   Manhattan Engineer District project, running everything from its research to the
   construction of the factories. Yet it is often implied that one of his subordinates, the
    director of the Los Alamos laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, was in charge. The
   academic-research-centred view of invention systematically downplays the crucial
      non-academic and non-physics elements of such projects as the bomb.
  ($800m in 1996 dollars). This was a very large sum for the time, but
  within an order of magnitude of other projects. Assuming each type
  of bomb cost $35m to develop, that was around ten times the develop-
  ment cost of the pre-war DC4 aircraft, and about the same as that of
  a new car today. There were many other very large projects, even in
  the USA. Among them were radar development, a huge effort to make
  new synthetic rubbers following the fall of the world’s main rubber
  plantations to the Japanese, and indeed large projects in medicine,
  among them penicillin and anti-malarial compounds. These all built
  on decades of experience in large-scale research and development,
  from nylon to coal hydrogenation, from motor cars to large airships.

     Is the rate of invention ever increasing?
     Given the paucity of and poor quality of the data, constructing a
     historical story of the changing patterns of invention is problem-
     atic. We should thus be sceptical of any claim for an increase or a
     decrease in the rate or significance of inventions in any particular
     historical period. The measures by which any such conclusion could
     be arrived at simply do not exist, and such measures as do exist
     suggest caution should be exercised. The main statistical informa-
     tion we have on invention is numbers of patents. Patents are legal
    documents granted to inventors giving them exclusive rights to the
     invention for fixed periods. Yet only some inventions are patented,
    and many developments cannot be patented. The existence of a
     patent gives no indication of its significance, nor that of the under-
     lying technology. Furthermore different nations adopted different
     patent systems, and all changed over time. Inventors have differed
     in their desire to get patents too. Only a small proportion of patents
     are ever worked; indeed only 10 per cent or less have been kept in
     force for their permitted time. Unlike most property, most patents
     turn out to have no value at all. Patents are a particular kind of
     legal claim on a certain invention, not necessarily one anywhere
     near being exploited successfully.'”
      Yet we can get some useful hints from this statistical history. Firstly,
     and perhaps most surprisingly, the rate of patenting has not changed
    much over time. US patents granted to US residents varied between
    around 30,000 per annum to 50,000 per annum between 1910 and
     1990, despite population growth, and even more significant economic
     growth. In some periods, notably the early 1930s, there were signifi-
     cant falls in patenting activity. This led to the belief among many that
     large US monopolies were retarding technological progress.!> Since
     the early 1980s there was a steady increase, such that resident patent
     grants reached around 80,000 at the beginning of the twenty-first
     century. In the European Union growth has been slower. To reinforce
     the earlier caution about drawing too many conclusions we should
     note that by these measures Japan was, at the end of the twentieth

  century, three times more inventive than the United States, and Korea
  more than twice as inventive. Is this plausible?
   Another way of getting at these issues is to look at research and
  development expenditure. This is an input into some, but certainly
  not all invention. Most has gone on the development not invention
   as such. R&D expenditure was tiny in comparison to the economy in
   1900, then these expenditures, by both government and industry, grew
  rapidly through the decades to the 1960s, much faster than the growing
  economy, especially in the long boom, and reached around 3 per cent
  of GDP for the richest countries. From the late 1960s R&D grew about
   as fast as the economies of rich countries, meaning that the propor-
  tion of GDP accounted for by R&D has hardly changed. Given that
  the rate of growth of the main R&D performers was low by historic
  standards, it follows that the rate of increase of R&D expenditures
  slowed down in the last decades of the twentieth century. Although
  the rate of growth of R&D has slipped very considerably, the actual
  amounts spent were greater year on year, with falls in some years.
    Increases in R&D expenditure suggest that inputs into invention
  and development have grown very significantly with time. Yet, these
  increases did not lead to any comparable rise in the number of patents.
  This suggests, again, that patents may be a very poor indicator of
  invention, and certainly of development. It could also suggest that
  over the century the costs of invention and development have been
  rising. Some have felt that innovations became increasingly trivial and
  expensive.'* One area where there has been a clear decline in R&D
  productivity is in pharmaceuticals. The number of new chemical
  entities (NCEs) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
  doubled between 1963 to the end of the century: they averaged about
  fourteen per annum in the 1960s and 1970s, rising from the 1980s to
  reach around twenty-seven in the 1990s. Yet over the same period
  the R&D expenditure of the pharmaceutical industry grew nearly
  twenty-fold.!° The common explanation is that the development costs
  of drugs have increased, especially as clinical testing becomes more
  expensive and time-consuming. A recent estimate of the total cost of

```

```
    R&D to achieve an approved new chemical entity in the pharmaceuti-
     cal industry is about $400m, though it needs to be recognised that this
     includes costs of projects which were stopped before they reached the
     end; thus the costs of successful projects are lower.'®
     Another factor needs to be taken into account. The NCE measure
     tells us nothing about the efficacy of new approved drugs, nor how
     different they are from each other. It could be that new drugs are
     radically better than old ones, yet there have been few if any drugs
     of the significance of those produced decades earlier. Pharmaceutical
    companies make huge investments in the development, testing and
    marketing of ‘me-too’ drugs, minor variants of existing treatments.
    They are inventing and developing better mousetraps.
     The pharmaceutical firms now account for around one-third of
     all development and research expenditure. Pharmaceuticals plus the
    motor-car industry perform around half the world R&D total. Yet it
     is hardly the case that the new products of either industry have been
    making anything like the radical difference made when these indus-
     tries spent much less on R&D. There is nothing as novel or as signifi-
     cant as penicillin or the Model T.
     What then of biotechnology, a central case for the argument
     that invention has shifted from corporate laboratories? The record
     here has been very disappointing if one looks behind the hype.
    Even in the face of low invention in traditional pharmaceuticals,
    only about a quarter of new pharmaceuticals are of biotechnologi-
     cal origin, though on a stricter definition it is considerably lower.
    Even on the widest possible definition, biotechnology-originated
    pharmaceuticals account for only 7 per cent of drug sales. In 2004
     the leading biotech firm (Amgen, founded in 1980) had sales only
     one-fifth of each of the leading three or four firms in the phar-
    maceutical industry. The pioneering company, Genentech, founded
     in 1976, had sales of $4bn in 2004. There have been twelve signifi-
     cant new biotechnological drugs in terms of sales since the 1980s,
     three of them synthetic replacements for existing ones. Only sixteen
    new biotechnological drugs offering more than minimal improve-

```
  ment over previous treatments have been launched since 1986. More
  interestingly, biotech innovations are already declining in additional
  clinical efficiency, and there has been a lot of me-too innovation
  in this field too. The impact on overall health will be minimal,
  despite enormous private and public investment in invention, partly
  because the drugs are for rare conditions.'”
    It is little wonder that in the pharmaceutical industry and biotech
  the investment in public relations and marketing is so huge. Pharma
  companies spend more on marketing than R&D — which tells us that
  they are not selling products that are obviously superior to those of their
  competitors. Penicillin did not need marketing; particular variants did.
    It is against that background that we should consider easily the
  most cited piece of evidence for a rapidly increasing rate of change in
  technology in recent years — the power of computing. It has proceeded
  at an astonishingly fast rate. In 1965 Gordon Moore, the research and
  development director of Fairchild Semiconductor, and soon to be one
  of the founders of Intel, suggested that the number of transistors on an
  integrated circuit that could be economically made would continue to
  grow at the same rate as in the early 1960s. In 1975 he thought growth
  would continue, but at half the rate he was measuring in 1965. Indeed
  the rate did fall, but there was a steady increase at roughly the rate
  predicted in 1975. But that rate of change was enormous. Between the
  1970s and the early 1990s Intel’s own processors increased the number
  of components at the constant rate of 100 times per decade. In the late
  1990s that rate increased, though not to 1960s’ levels.
   That one-hundred-fold-a-decade rate of change sustained for
  forty-five years is unprecedented. We do not find it in motor cars at
  the beginning of the century or since. We do not find it anywhere else
  today either. It cannot stand [for ][technical ] [change ] [in ][general. ]
   By the standards of the past, the present does not seem radically inno-
  vative. Indeed judging from the [present, ] [the ][past ][looks ] [extraordinarily ]
  inventive. We need only think of [the ][twenty ][years ] [1890-1910 ] [which ] [gave ]

             Conclusion
    We have long been told that we live with an ‘ever-increasing rate of
     change’, yet there is good evidence that it is not always increasing.
     Measuring change is extremely difficult, but let us start with economic
     growth in the rich countries as a crude measure. While there was
     rapid growth before the Great War, there was slower growth overall
     between 1913 and 1950. There was spectacular growth in the long
    boom, followed by less strong growth since. In other words, growth
     rates were lower in the interwar years than before 1914, and average
      rates of economic growth after 1973 were considerably lower than in
     the period 1950-1973. In the 1970s there was a ‘productivity slowdown’
     and since then the rich world has continued to grow, but not at his-
     torically unprecedented rates.
      Since the 1980s one could be forgiven for believing that high growth
     rates had returned, not least because of the constant evocations of the
     notion of ‘ever increasing change’, and all the talk of fundamental tran-
     sitions to new economies and new times. But in the USA, Japan, the
     EU and Britain, growth rates were lower in the 1990s than in the 1980s,
     lower in the 1980s than in the 1970s and lower in the 1970s than in the
     1960s.’ In the USA it appears that productivity growth increased in the
      late 1990s, but there is still a dispute as to whether this was general, or
     concentrated in the computer-manufacturing sector. Growth is not
     the same as change but there is no evidence that structural change in
     the rich countries was any faster in recent decades than in the long
     boom. Once again, our future-oriented rhetoric has underestimated
     the past, and overestimated the power of the present.
      Not all parts of the world grew at these same rhythms. For example
     the USSR grew very fast in the 1930s, while the rest of the world did not.

  Especially since the 1970s many economies in the Far East have grown
 very fast, but from a low base. The increasing scale of the Chinese
 economy in particular has meant that its growth has been enough to
  alter the global statistics materially. For example, global steel produc-
  tion is growing at long boom rates again thanks to China.
  Another important feature of change in the last three decades is
  that there has been a decline of economies, as well as growth. In some
  places the last years of the twentieth century saw retrogression. The
 income per head of the 700 million sub-Saharan Africans fell from
 $700 per head in 1980 to the even more miserable $500 at the end of
  the century; to make matters worse for the majority, 45 per cent of
  this output was produced in South Africa so the real fall elsewhere was
 even worse.” Malaria has become more common, and new diseases
 such a HIV/AIDS have swept through the continent as no other. Yet
  this is not a reversion to an old world, for this is a continent with cars
 and new kinds of shanty towns, a rapidly urbanising world without
 what is taken to be modern industry.
  From 1989 there was a remarkably rapid collapse in the economies
  of the Soviet Union and its former satellites, of 20, 30 and 40 per cent,
  far outstripping the capitalist recession of the early 1980s. Although
  this dramatic fall in output cannot be characterised generally as a
 technological retrogression such a phenomenon was evident in some
 places. Now independent Moldova, formerly part of the USSR, lost 60
 per cent of its output. Machines virtually phased out as the economy
 had developed since the Second World War, things such as ‘spinning
 wheels, weaving looms, butter churns, wooden grape presses and
 stone bread ovens — are now back in use’, it was reported in 2001. The
 ‘only way to survive is to be totally self-sufficient, claimed the curator
 of the ethnological museum in Belsama, ‘and that means turning the
 clock back’? Cuba, as we have seen, expanded the number of its oxen
  as it lost its supply of tractors.
   In some industries, such as shipbreaking, there has been a move
 towards a new kind of low-tech future. By the 1980s Taiwan had
 become by far the largest shipbreaker, demolishing more than a third

      modern technology on Alang Beach, Gujarat, India, in 2004. Alang Beach became the
       single largest centre of the shipbreaking industry, and a startling example of the new
       technological retrogression. The ship, originally HMS Vengeance, launched in 1945,
           was built at a time when shipbreaking was more capital intensive.
     of the world’s ships. By the early 1990s it was out of this industry, now
     dominated by India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, which between them
     had more than 80 per cent of the world market by 1995.* Taiwan used
     specialised dock facilities, but the new shipbreaking was on beaches,
     with the most minimal equipment, carried out by thousands of
     barefoot workers. The reason shipbreaking was done in these places
     was that scrap steel was in demand locally. But it is used in a markedly
      different way from other places and times: it is re-rolled, re-worked,
     rather than used to make fresh steel.
      What seems at first technological retrogression was perhaps not
     unknown in earlier years of the century. No one had ever attempted
      to build such a large canal with what were then such primitive means

  cal retrogression, for all the emphasis on the tractor. However, not for
  many centuries has a global industry retrogressed like shipbreaking
  has.
          a
  This book has argued for the importance of the seemingly old. It is
  also a plea for a novel way of looking at the history of the techno-
  logical world, one which will change our minds about what that world
  has been like. And implicit in it is a plea for novel ways of thinking
  about the technological present.
   We should be aware, for example, that most change is taking
  place by the transfer of techniques from place to place. The scope
  for such change is enormous given the level of inequalities that exist
  with respect to technology. Even among rich countries there are very
  important differences in, for example, carbon intensity. If the USA
  were to reduce its energy-use levels to those of Japan, the impact on
  total energy use would be very significant. But for poor countries, as
  well as for rich ones, such a message is often unwelcome. For imitating
  is seen as a much less worthy activity than innovating. To imitate,
  to replicate, is to deny one’s creativity, to impose upon oneself what
  was designed for others by others. “Que inventen ellos’ (‘Let them
  invent’) is seen not as sensible policy advice, but a recipe for national
  humiliation. To have technology or science’is, it is often deeply felt,
  to create something new. The answer to such concerns that is implicit
  in this book is that all countries, firms, individuals, with rare and
  unusual exceptions, have relied on others to invent, and have imitated
  more than they have invented.
   Arguments about imitating policies and practices for innovation
  might seem to fall in the same category. That is to say, that it might
  seem like a good thing that they [should ] [be ][the ][same ] [or ] [similar ] [around ]
  the world. Indeed there is [a ] remarkable [lack ] [of ][originality ] [in ] [inno- ]
  vation policies globally, and many [explicit ] [calls ] [for ] [copying ] [those ]

     perceived as the most successful models. Yet while copying existing
     technology is very sensible, imitating innovation policies may be a
     mistake. For if all nations, areas and firms are agreed about what the
     research should be, by definition it will no longer be innovative; and it
     might not bea good thing that all nations pursue the same policies for
     research, because they are likely to come up with similar inventions
     only a few of which will be used even if technologically successful. ‘If
     I knew the future of jazz I'd be there already, said one wise musician.
      Calling for innovation is, paradoxically, a common way of avoiding
     change when change is not wanted. The argument that future science
     and technology will deal with global warming is an instance. It is
     implicitly arguing that in today’s world only what we have is possible.
     Yet we-have the technological capacity to do things very differently: we
      are not technologically determined.
      Getting away, as this book has, from the conflation of use and
     invention/innovation will in itself have a major impact on our
     thinking about novelty generation. The twentieth century was awash
     with inventions and innovations, so that most had to fail. Recognising
     this will have a liberating effect. We need no longer worry about being
     resistant to innovation, or being behind the times, when we chose not
      to take up an invention. Living in an inventive age requires us to reject
     the majority that are on offer. We are free to oppose technologies we
     do not like, however much interested pundits and governments tell us
      it is essential to accept, say, GM crops. There are alternative technolo-
     gies, alternative paths of invention. The history of invention is not the
     history of a necessary future to which we must adapt or die, but rather
     of failed futures, and of futures firmly fixed in the past.
      We should feel free to research, develop, innovate, even in areas
     which are considered out of date by those stuck in passé futuristic
     ways of thinking. Most inventions will continue to fail, the future will
     remain uncertain. Indeed the key problem in research policy should
     be ensuring that there are many more good ideas, and thus many more
     failed ideas. Stopping projects at the right time is the key to a successful
     invention and innovation policy, but doing this means being critical
