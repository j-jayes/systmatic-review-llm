## Abstract

We study the consequences of worker displacement during the second industrial revolution using novel archival data on the 19th-century Swedish iron industry combined with linked census data. Ironworkers displaced by the industrial transformation exited the iron industry at higher rates, were more likely to migrate internally, and ended up in occupations that paid on average 10% less compared to non-displaced workers. While the displacement effects persist over time for workers, we find no evidence of spillovers on their children. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to quantify the effects of worker displacement during the second industrial revolution.

## 1 Introduction

Technological progress has displaced workers since at least the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution shifted economic activity from agriculture and small workshops to large-scale factories (Atack, Bateman and Margo, 2008). The displacement of workers during this period resulted in social unrest and violence (Caprettini and Voth, 2020) and sparked a skepticism of technology that persists to this day (Mokyr, 1992). However, despite the central role of labor displacement in the narratives surrounding the Industrial Revolution, quantitative evidence on the effects of displacement on workers and their families during this decisive period in economic history is scarce. More generally, while the recent literature has provided excellent insight into displacement effects in modern economies, we still know little about the effects of worker displacement during earlier stages of economic development.

In this paper, we study the effects of worker displacement during the second industrial revolution using a novel data set on the 19th-century Swedish iron industry. The iron industry played a pivotal role in European economic history, being among the first sectors to undergo industrialization. In Sweden, the real output of the iron industry quadrupled between 1850 and 1900 as production moved to increasingly large-scale industrial plants. However, this episode of industrialization simultaneously resulted in the displacement of workers as hundreds of smaller artisanal production sites closed down, the overwhelming majority of which had been producing iron for centuries.

We first analyze this structural change within an economic framework where relative productivity changes across regions determine plant closures, out-migration, and job switching. The underlying mechanism is that some regions were better equipped to accommodate larger establishments, which required additional capital and access to large quantities of raw materials. The framework suggests that

the severity of displacement depends on the substitutability of ironworkers between the old and new plants. In this context, where the displacement event has a strong spatial dimension, this refers not only to how easily ironworkers could migrate to the expanding regions at the center of the iron industry, but also to the elasticity of substitution between production in the declining and expanding regions. While much of the literature on technological change and labor focuses on the skill-biased nature of labor-saving technologies (Bound and Johnson, 1992; Card and DiNardo, 2002; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011), our model extends this understanding by considering spatial dimensions of industrialization.

To identify iron production site closures we digitized archival annual mining reports covering the universe of iron production sites in Sweden between 1860 and 1894. We combine this data with linked census data from the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), which covers the entire Swedish population in 1880, 1890, and 1900. The census data enables us to observe individual workers and follow their occupation and migration decisions over time. By combining the production reports and census data, we can identify individuals employed in the iron industry and who lived in parishes where iron production ceased between 1880 and 1890. We estimate the effects of site closures on worker outcomes by comparing the outcomes of displaced workers to those working in parishes where the iron industry continued to operate. We use information on workers outside the iron industry to control for broader regional economic trends between regions where the iron industry continued to operate and ceases.

Despite the general expansion of the industrial sector and iron industry in Sweden during this period, we find that workers who were displaced by site closures between 1880 and 1890 appear to have suffered negative consequences when observed in 1890. Displaced ironworkers are around 23 - 25 percentage points more likely to exit the iron industry compared to their non-displaced colleagues. In addition, displaced ironworkers were around 25 percentage points more likely

to migrate to another parish, which may have alleviated some adverse effects of displacement. However, despite the migration response and occupation switches, displaced ironworkers tended to move down the occupational earnings distribution. Displaced ironworkers ended up in occupations that on average paid 10% less compared to their non-displaced counterparts. Interestingly, the effects of displacement on iron industry employment, migration, and occupational earnings are similar when observing worker outcomes in 1900, suggesting that the shock persists over a long period of time for the displaced ironworkers.

We interpret the estimates as causal effects of iron industry site closures, driven by relative productivity shocks. This interpretation relies on the parallel-trend assumption that the outcomes of all ironworkers observed in 1880 would have evolved similarly had the industrial transformation not caused iron production to shut down in some specific locations. One concern with this approach is reverse causality, that the supply side of the labor market, such as migration trends or changes in human capital, drives plant closures rather than the other way around. However, when we estimate the same model for workers in occupations outside of the iron industry, we find no differences in occupational changes, migration responses, or occupation earnings between regions where the iron industry closed and remained open. This suggests that the results are specific to workers in the iron industry, as opposed to general changes in local economic conditions or infrastructure development. Second, while we model plant closure as a consequence of competition from more modern, expanding plants, it appears as the migration responses are driven by job loss and not by new opportunities elsewhere. Using a subset of iron production sites that remained open until 1890 but did not substantially increase production, we show that the results are driven by the displacement of workers in parishes where the iron industry ceased to exist, rather than the effects of an expansion of the iron industry in the control regions. Finally, we collected data on the site closures between 1890 - 1900 from additional sources

to identify whether ironworkers were on different trends in treated and untreated parishes prior to closure. We find no differences in occupation switches, migration behavior, or occupational earnings for ironworkers in the treated and untreated parishes in the period prior to the site closure. This further suggests that our estimates reflect the causal effect of the site closures, rather than differences in pre-trends between sites that closed and remained open.

A second concern is worker sorting, where workers may relocate in anticipation of future closures. To address this possibility, we first restrict the sample to workers living in their parish of birth, who are less likely to have spatially sorted based on short-term plant prospects. Second, we restrict the analysis to sites that closed after 1885, making it less likely that workers could anticipate the closure when we first observe their location in 1880. In both cases, we find results that are very similar to the baseline estimates. Third, we study site-level employee counts from the production reports and find that the number of workers starts to decline only two years before closure, further limiting concerns over worker selection.

A third concern is that we can only observe outcomes for workers who survived and remained in Sweden by 1890. Therefore, if displacement significantly affects either worker mortality or international migration our estimates may suffer from endogenous attrition. To address this contingency, we perform a sample attrition analysis and find that the likelihood of linking workers between the 1880 and 1890 census is similar for displaced and non-displaced ironworkers. This suggests that endogenous attrition is unlikely to affect the results.

We also study the intergenerational effects of worker displacement. We find that children of displaced workers are less likely to be employed in the iron industry and more likely to have migrated from their parish of birth compared to children of non-displaced workers. However, their occupational earnings are not statistically different from the occupational earnings of children of non-displaced workers. Hence, despite finding long-lasting decreases in occupational earnings

for individual workers affected by displacement, we conclude that the effects were relatively transitory in the sense that they did not propagate to subsequent generations.

Finally, we investigate the role of migration. Over half of the displaced ironworker eventually migrates away from their parish of residence, highlighting that spatial mobility may have been an important response during this period. The median (mean) moving distance is 50 (84) km, highlighting that these migration responses were not local in nature. When studying the outcomes by migration status, we find that a similar decline in occupational earnings of displaced ironworkers in the short-run regardless of migration status. However, the adverse effects in the long run are concentrated among the workers who did not to migrate from their original parish of residence following the displacement event. The occupational earnings of displaced workers who decided to migrate are no longer significantly different from their non-displaced peers in the control group by 1900. This suggests that regional migration may have mitigated the displacement shock for some workers in the long run.

Our paper contributes to several strands of research. First, we contribute to the literature on how technological change affects worker outcomes and hence the income distribution (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000; Milanovic, 2005; Lindert and Williamson, 2016; Goldin and Sokoloff, 1984; Atkinson, 2015). Innovations in agriculture have displaced workers globally since the early 19th century and continue to do so in the developing world today (Olmstead and Rhode, 2001). The shift from artisanal spinning and weaving to industrial textile production led to the widespread displacement of workers in England (Mantoux 1928) which triggered the so-called Luddite movement, a technology skepticism that has survived to this date (Mokyr 1992). Similarly, threats of worker displacement in this period gave rise to political populism in the US (Alsan, Eriksson and Niemesh, 2020). Although the productivity gains and reinstatement of labor have historically coun-

terbalanced long-run displacement effects of technological change (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019), the effects on the displaced workers in the short run might be substantial (Feigenbaum and Gross, 2020). This paper advances the literature by studying one of history's most significant displacement shocks, the transition from artisanal to industrial production during the Industrial Revolution, and provides novel worker-level estimates of displacement on industry exits, migration, and occupational earnings of affected workers. 1

Notably, the estimated occupational earnings losses of displaced 19th-century ironworkers are similar to earnings losses suffered by workers laid off today (Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan, 1993; Eliason and Storrie, 2006; Couch and Placzek, 2010; Seim, 2019). This is noteworthy given the absence of unemployment and training programs in the late 19th century which have been shown to play an important role in reducing the impact of contemporary displacement shocks (Edin et al., 2023). The results suggest an important role for local migration, with around half of the ironworkers migrating to a different location following the iron site closures. In the long run, workers who migrated to a new location, unlike their more stationary peers, did not end up in occupations associated with lower occupational earnings. The role of regional migration as a potential coping mechanism has received little attention in the displacement literature, with the exception of Huttunen, Møen and Salvanes (2018) and Gathmann, Helm and Schnberg (2020), o who show a similar role of regional mobility in helping workers adjust to job losses in contemporary settings in Norway and Germany.

Our study also contributes to research on the social and intergenerational effects of worker displacement. The displacement of workers during the industrialization of the Swedish iron industry in the 19th century did not appear to have significant scarring effects on the next generation - at least not in terms of occupational earnings. The existing evidence on intergenerational effects is mixed.

Some papers find that children of displaced fathers have lower annual earnings (Oreopoulos, Page and Stevens, 2008), worse health and nutritional outcomes (Schaller and Zerpa, 2019; Pieters and Rawlings, 2020), and lower educational performance (Rege, Telle and Votruba, 2011; Stevens and Schaller, 2011), while other papers find small or insignificant effects (Bratberg, Nilsen and Vaage, 2008; Hilger, 2016; Mrk, Sjgren and Svaleryd, 2020). o o Several papers find adverse effects on worker health (Browning and Heinesen, 2012; Eliason and Storrie, 2009), spousal health (Marcus, 2013; Bubonya, Cobb-Clark and Wooden, 2017), and parental health and family separations (Mrk, Sjgren and Svaleryd, 2020), sugo o gesting that worker displacement can permanently harm human capital.

Finally, our paper is the first to estimate the effects of worker displacement at the early stages of industrialization. Canonical work in development economics focuses on the transition of workers from traditional sectors of the economy to emerging modern industries (Lewis, 1954; Harris and Todaro, 1970). This transformative process is currently underway in many parts of Africa (McMillan and Zeufack 2022). However, we are unaware of empirical studies that assess the consequences of worker displacement during this crucial phase of economic development. By highlighting the importance of migration as a response to local shocks, our findings suggest that facilitating worker migration, for example through the provision of transportation for rural households (Bryan, Chowdhury and Mobarak, 2014), might be an effective way to reduce the costs of industrial transformation.

The remainder of the paper continues as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the historical context, the data and the empirical approach. Section 3 presents the main findings. Section 4 presents robustness and sensitivity tests. In section 5 we extend the analysis to the next generation and discuss the effectiveness of the migration response. Finally, section 6 concludes.

## 2 Historical context, data and methodology

## 2.1 Background

The Swedish iron industry in 1850 consisted of hundreds of small blast furnaces and finery forges scattered across the countryside. Skilled artisans and craftsmen produced iron using techniques developed out of centuries-old traditions. The industry comprised around six hundred active production sites, most of which were founded in the 17th century or even earlier. 2 By 1900, large ironworks organized as modern factories had almost entirely replaced the old forges and the real output of Swedish iron had more than quadrupled (BiSOS, 2019). The transformation of the iron industry marks the beginning of a period of rapid industrialization in Sweden's economic history and is typical of the economic changes associated with the second industrial revolution (Mokyr, 1992).

The transformation of the Swedish iron industry was a consequence of technological developments beginning in Great Britain (Eriksson, 1957). In 1784 the British inventor Henry Cort patented an improved 'puddling process' for converting crude pig iron into malleable bar iron, which revolutionized the quality and cost of British iron (Attman, 1958). Swedish iron producers were early to recognize the benefits of this process (Ryd'n, 2017). e However, immediate adoption was prevented by the lack of domestic coal deposits. Figure 1 illustrates the growth of the British and Swedish pig iron production during the first half of the 19th century. 3 Although British output was comparable to Sweden's in 1800, it exceeded Swedish output by more than an order of magnitude by 1850. At the same time, declining production costs led to falling prices of iron goods in British

markets. These developments posed raised concerns among Swedish producers, not least due to the importance of Britain as a major export market for Swedish iron.

The challenges arising from British puddle iron generated dedicated efforts in Sweden to close the technological gap. However, the Swedish iron industry struggled to keep up with the mounting foreign competition in the first half of the 19th century (Attman, 1986). The first significant breakthrough came in 1845 when the Swedish metallurgist Gustaf Ekman invented a charcoal-based production method known as the 'Swedish Lancashire process'. Heckscher and Heckscher (1954) note the significance of this achievement as 'one of the most glorious pages in Swedish economic history'. A second breakthrough came with the so-called 'ingot steel processes'. These include the Bessemer process, invented in 1856, and the Siemens-Martin process, invented in 1865. Parallel with the transformation of Swedish iron production, these breakthroughs laid the groundwork for the

rise of the modern Swedish steel industry. 4

In addition to the technological improvements, the advance of liberal economic policies around the mid-19th century began to erode some pre-industrial institutions that had restricted the growth of the Swedish iron industry. Most importantly, Swedish iron producers had been subject to output restrictions under the so-called 'smidesregleringen'. This monopolistic policy dated back to the 18th century when Swedish iron dominated the European iron trade (Heckscher, 1949). It was gradually retracted through the legalization of pig iron exports in 1835 and increased production quotas for bar iron in 1838, and was finally abolished in 1846 (Isacson, 1997; Olsson, 2007). Other archaic policies sought to protect the traditional iron industry by rationing land resources for charcoal production and ensuring quality by regulating work procedures (Bothius, 1958). e The so-called 'hammarsmedsordningarna' and 'masmastarordningen' dating back to 1637 and 1649 were both abolished in 1858 (Isacson, 1997). This removed a significant part of the regulations which, according to Heckscher and Heckscher (1954), imposed 'insuperable obstacles to industrial reorganization' in the Swedish iron industry.

The liberal reforms and technological innovations contributed to an exceptionally expansive phase in the Swedish iron industry, beginning in the mid-19th century. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Between 1850 and 1900 the total output of pig iron increased from 141 to 526 thousand tonnes, while the output of bar iron increased from 97 to 489 thousand tonnes. 5 The changes also facilitated the emergence of new organizational structures. By the end of the 19th century, the once-dominant cooperative associations of craftsmen had been largely replaced by

5 These numbers translate to an annual growth rate of around 2.6% for pig iron and 3.2% for bar iron. In the preceding period, 1800 to 1850, real output growth was more limited, amounting to annual growth rates of around 1.2% for pig iron and 1.3% for bar iron

hierarchical firm structures, which clearly separated the roles of capital owners, engineers, and workers.

Figure 2: Production in the Swedish iron industry: 1800-1900

<!-- image -->

Note: Swedish bar and pig iron output for 1800-1900 are from Olsson (2007). The total number of operational furnaces and finery forges (production sites) is from Statistics Sweden (BiSOS C) for the period 1860-1900, and from ˚ berg (1999) for the years 1800, 1825 and 1850. A

Most of the iron production sites that existed in Sweden in the mid-19th century had been producing iron for over two hundred years. 6 Prior to industrialization, high transportation costs combined with the demand for large quantities of charcoal in iron production exerted a centrifugal force on the spatial distribution of sites. In effect, the geographical concentration of production was constrained by the availability of local forest resources. This issue was gradually alleviated by technological advances and the expansion of railway networks in the latter half of

the 19th century. As competitive pressures increased, other factors became more important, including distance to ore fields, transportation, and access to local hydropower resources.

The new technologies generally required larger facilities and continuous production to operate efficiently. This meant that iron producers needed to scale up their operations to stay competitive. Hundreds of producers were unable to make the necessary adjustments and were forced to shut down. This event is commonly referred to as 'the great decline of the forges' ('den stora bruksdden') and has o been well documented by Swedish economic historians. Figure 2 illustrates the development by plotting the number of active production sites over time. Between 1860 and 1900 the number of sites fell by about two-thirds, from around 600 to 200 sites. At the same time, total employment in the iron industry doubled as shown in figure D.1 in the appendix, increasing the average number of workers per site by a factor of six. In appendix A, we discuss a number of factors that influenced the destruction or survival of individual plants in this period. By 1913, Boethius (1958) notes that 37 ironworks represented over 90 percent of the Swedish iron and steel output.

Since the decennial Swedish census data starts in 1880 and the mining books extend to 1894, we will focus on the period between 1880 and 1890. We use the digitalized production reports to identify all recorded site closures in this time period. We cross-reference the closure dates reported in the books using external sources, and exclude closures that represent a transition from iron production into other closely related types of manufacturing not covered in the mining book data. This approach permits us to identify 99 geographically located site closures occurring between 1880 and 1890. The left-hand panel of figure 3 shows the sites where iron production ceased between 1880 - 1890 and where it continued.

Blue indicates that iron production continued between 1880 and 1890 (for parishes, indicating the survival of at least one site), whereas red indicates that production shut down between 1880 and 1890 (for parishes, indicating that all sites closed down).

## 2.2 Theory

The 19th-century transformation of the Swedish iron industry illustrates how technological change, international competition, and regulatory changes can reshape production. New technologies and innovations that scaled up production increased the importance of access to natural resources, such as coal and sufficient water supply to use for power generation, which altered the regional distribution of iron production. In this section, we provide a conceptual framework to analyze the

effects of this structural change on worker outcomes.

We consider a Cournot model with a number of 'iron plants' operating in two regions. To align the conceptual framework with our empirical model, the regions are labeled treatment ( T , where the traditional iron industry closed) and control ( C , where it continued). Each region has n j iron plants which compete for ironworkers within the same region, where j = T, C . The productivity of workers in the two regions is denoted by A T (treatment) and A C (control). Assuming both regions produce the same good with a price normalized to 1 (a simplifying restriction that will be relaxed later in this framework), the profit function for a plant i in region j is given by:

$$π ji = A L j ji -w ji ( L ji ) L ji -K, (1)$$

where production uses only labor L ji , so output is Q ji = A L j ji . The fixed capital cost K is the same in both regions, representing natural resource requirements for plant maintenance.

The residual supply curve of labor facing an individual plant 1 in region j is:

n

<!-- image -->

j

where w j 1 is the wage rate of plant 1. The residual labor supply curve is conventional except for the term M j , which is net out-migration of ironworkers from region j . The term M j reflects that out-migration makes labor costlier ( M j is negative if there is net in-migration). This aspect means that labor productivity shocks will spill over across regions.

With this set-up, we derive labor market, migration and plant closure responses to changes in technology ( A j ) and capital requirements ( K ) which are the main

exogenous variables. Labor demand L ji for a plant is determined through Cournot competition, where plant i in region j maximize π ji with respect to L ji taking the other regional plants' demand for labor and out-migration M j as given. Since all plants in a region are identical, the subgame perfect equilibrium values of L ji are:

$$L ji = L j = A j -M , j 1 + n j ∀ i = 1 , ..., n j . (3)$$

Substituting this into the profit function and setting π j = 0 gives the competitive number of plants:

$$1 + n j = A j -M . j √ K (4)$$

Equation (4) indicates that the number of competitive plants increases with productivity ( A j ) but decreases with capital requirements ( K ). This aligns with historical accounts of Sweden's declining number of forges at the end of the 19th century as new technologies became more capital-intensive due to the larger required scale. The number of plants also decreases with out-migration, as labor becomes less affordable. Substituting (4) into (3) gives:

$$L j = √ K, n L j j = A j -M j -√ K, w j = A j -√ K, (5)$$

showing that an increase in capital requirements leads to higher labor per plant ( L j ) but fewer plants ( n j ), reducing total labor demand ( n L j j ). Higher productivity can counteract this effect by restoring employment and output. Additionally, because fixed capital costs K increases the surviving plants' market power, workers are paid less than their marginal product ( w &lt; A j j ).

We next consider regional migration. Assume that the two regions have the same exogenous wage for non-iron industry jobs. Workers migrate from treatment to control regions if the ironworker wage difference is significant. Let α be an individual-specific migration cost, uniformly distributed on the unit interval, and let σ be a general migration cost. Workers migrate out of treatment regions if

w C -1 2 σα &gt; w T -(1 -α ) 1 2 σ . Normalizing the total labor force to 1, we can express out-migration as a share relative to the baseline labor force share in each region, 1 2 , at w C = w T . Out-migrants thus equal:

$$M T = IP ( α < w C -w T σ ) -1 2 = A C -A T σ . (6)$$

Substituting (6) into (5) gives the equilibrium ironworker labor in region T :

$$n L T T = σ +1 σ A T -1 σ A C -√ K, (7)$$

with analogous expressions for control regions (switching subindices from T to C ).

The parameter σ indicates how easily ironworkers migrate. High migration costs ( σ → ∞ ) mean an idiosyncratic shock to A T has no effect on competing regions' employment. With low σ , migration is feasible, and productivity shocks spill over across regions through competitive pressure on labor demand.

Finally, substituting (6) into (4), the equilibrium number of plants is given by:

$$1 + n T = σ +1 σ A T -1 σ A C √ K . (8)$$

The productivity parameters A T , A C , and K determine the evolution of the number of plants, employment, and output over time. In Figure 4, we simulate these outcomes, assuming constant productivity in treatment regions while productivity in control regions increase exponentially. We also assume that the capital requirements increase overall. The simulated trends align with the historical descriptive data presented in previous sections, on the development of iron forges and employment over time. There is a marked decrease in the number of plants, but the decrease is uneven. The more productive regions expand production and the labor force using fewer plants, thus reconciling the historical facts that the Swedish iron sector expanded while a large number of smaller plants closed down.

We have so far assumed that the goods produced in both regions have identical

A C = 0 1 + 0 5 . . t + 0 1 . t 2 ), and capital requirements are increasing with √ K = 0 01 . × t. σ = 10. Prices fixed at P T = P C = 1.

prices, effectively disregarding demand-side considerations in the market for iron products. 7 However, if prices differ and the regions' outputs are close substitutes, competitive pressures on less productive regions intensify. Let the price of Q j be P j , modifying the profit function to π ji = P A L j j ji -w L ji ji -K . The global demand for the regional products is determined by a CES (constant elasticity of substitution) utility function:

$$U Q ,Q ( T C ) = ( Q ( ρ -1) /ρ T + Q ( ρ -1) /ρ C ) ρ/ ρ ( -1) , (9)$$

where the first-order condition for utility maximization yields:

$$Q C Q T = ( P T P C ) ρ . (10)$$

Here, ρ is the elasticity of substitution between goods, which also represents the elasticity of substitution across types of workers if a specific type of worker produces a specific type of good (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). This connection conveniently ties our framework to the standard skill-biased technological change model, adapted here to reflect a worker's region-specific productivity. With P j = w j + √ K A j and Q j = A n L j j j , equation (10) becomes:

$$w T + √ K w C + √ K ( n L T T n C L C ) 1 /ρ = ( A T A C ) ( ρ -1) /ρ . (11)$$

where n L T T is the labor demand in the economy. Notably, when √ K → 0 equation (11) is identical to the canonical skill-biased technological change equation (Card and DiNardo, 2002; Acemoglu and Autor, 2011), although in our version, the middle term is endogenous of relative migration flows. Specifically,

n L T T = ( σ +1 σ w T -1 σ w C ), so:

$$w T + √ K w C + √ K ( σ +1 σ w T -1 σ w C σ +1 σ w C -1 σ w T ) 1 ρ = ( A T A C ) ρ -1 ρ , (12)$$

which also embeds the migration cost parameter σ .

With product differentiation, the impact of technology depends on whether the production in treatment regions complements or substitutes the control region's production. If the two regions' products are near-perfect substitutes ( ρ → ∞ ), production in the less productive region will cease entirely when A C &gt; A T (and vice versa). Conversely, if the outputs are gross complements ( ρ &lt; 1), labor demand will increase in the less productive region. 8

Ultimately, the observed dynamics are significantly shaped by the fixed capital requirement ( K ). These costs enable us to derive a finite number of plants in competitive equilibrium, thereby explaining the observed plant deaths. As capital requirements increase, wages must adjust more to balance technological differences between regions, as reflected in the first ratio of (12). However, as wage disparities grow, the labor supply in the treatment region eventually depletes ( L T → 0) as 1 σ w C → σ +1 σ w T (second ratio in 12). Consequently, the fixed capital requirements combined with regional migration explain the concentration of workers in specific regions, such as factory towns, rather than being distributed across numerous rural forges. While K may adjust endogenously in the long run, certain aspects-such as natural resource availability or institutional constraints-remain fixed, limiting the adaptability of affected regions.

## 2.3 Empirical Specification

The effects of A T , A C and K are key determinants of structural change but are ultimately unobservable. Our empirical analysis focuses on displacement effects

using the 'death of the forges' as a natural experiment, comparing worker outcomes in regions with and without plant closures.

We interpret the driver of plant closures in treatment regions relative to control regions as a shock to A T relative to A C , driven by how well they can adopt the new technologies. These productivity changes affect closures directly by lowering labor's marginal productivity and indirectly through increased competitive labor costs (hence A C appears in Equation 8, provided the cost of migration σ is not very high). With the number of plants determining employment in an industry, a productivity shock's effect on total employment is compounded by labor demand and labor supply effects.

Plant closures in treatment regions are thus partly driven by productivity improvements in control regions. These spillovers are not necessarily a problem for identifying displacement effects. When uneven technological change drives plant closures through competition, a representative 'displacement effect' should take into account that the determinants that reduce labor demand at one site increases it elsewhere. Equation (8) does point to a reverse causality problem related to migration, however: if some random event, unrelated to productivity, causes some workers to move out (for example, a decrease in σ , a supply-side preference parameter), and labor scarcity force plants in out-migration regions to shut down, the correlations between plant closures and out-migration are not 'displacement effects'. Instead, it would be out-migration that drives plant closures.

To address this, we compare outcomes across regions and occupations, using non-ironworkers in 1880 as a secondary control group. This accounts for general migration push factors. Our regression specification is:

$$Y i = δD i + γ D ( i × W i ) + occupation i +region + i ϵ , i (13)$$

where Y i is the worker's outcome in 1890 (or 1900 for long-term effects). We focus on three outcomes: (1) continued employment in the iron industry, (2)

migration, and (3) changes in occupational earnings. D i is a dummy variable indicating workers who resided in 1880 in a parish where all iron production was shut down, as illustrated in figure 3. Hence, D i = 1 indicates that the worker resided in one of the treatment parishes where production stopped between 1880 and 1890, while D i = 0 indicates that the worker resided in one of the control parishes where iron production continued until at least 1890. W i is a dummy variable indicating that the worker was employed as an ironworker in 1880. Fixed effects for occupation and region are captured by occupation i and region . i 9

The coefficient δ represents the general effect of site closures on all types of workers in a region, while γ captures the displacement effect on ironworkers. We restrict the sample to male workers observed in both the 1880 and 1890 censuses to maximize observations. Additionally, we limit the sample to parishes with active iron production in 1880 to create a suitable control group for estimating the effect of site closures on ironworker outcomes.

The interpretation of γ as the causal effect of displacement relies on three key assumptions. First, we assume that the characteristics of ironworkers in 1880 are similar across treated and control parishes, implying that initial sorting (conditional on fixed effects) does not explain outcome differences in 1890 or 1900. Second, we assume that no unobserved factors affect ironworkers and non-ironworkers differently in treatment and control regions, while also influencing site closures between 1880 and 1890. Third, we assume that sample attrition is either similar across parishes or uncorrelated with potential outcomes. Section 4 provides extensive robustness checks and sensitivity tests to evaluate these assumptions.

## 2.4 Data

To study the transformation of the Swedish iron industry, we digitalized novel archival data from a series of annual production reports covering the period between 1860 and 1894 ('bergmstarrelationer'). a These annual production reports were compiled by the administrators of each mining district and submitted to the National Board of Trade. Each report contains detailed accounts of the district's mining and metal processing industries, including site-specific information on the activity at individual mines and ironworks.

We digitized the original handwritten reports stored in the Swedish National Archives in Stockholm and constructed a panel of year-site observations covering the universe of the Swedish iron and steel production sites between 1860 and 1894. 10 The digitized data contains information on the output of each production site for each year of operation, as well as employee counts for certain years. Figure 5 illustrates a page from the production reports. For our purposes, the production reports offer crucial data on the periods of activity of all ironworks, blast furnaces, and finery forges that operated in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century.

To collect information on worker outcomes, we use data from the Swedish population censuses of 1880, 1890, and 1900 which have been digitized by the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP). Each census contains individual-level data on various characteristics, including occupation, family structure, current place of residence, and place of birth. The NAPP has matched individual census records across censuses based on the personal information provided in the census, resulting in a linkage rate of 64% for males aged 25 - 45 between the 1880 and 1890

censuses, and a 55% linkage rate between 1880 and 1900. 1112 The linked census data thus allow us to track the outcomes of individual workers and their children between 1880 and 1900.

We rely on the occupational descriptions from the census to identify ironworkers in the data. The occupational descriptions were originally recorded by the parish priests and have been coded into five-digit HISCO codes by the NAPP. The occupational codes used to classify ironworkers are listed in table 1 below.

12 While it would be interesting also to study the labor market outcomes of females, we are limited by the fact that we only can observe occupations for a very small sub-sample. The labor force participation of women (excluding maids and domestic servants) during this period was around 5%.

Unfortunately, it is not always possible to distinguish ironworkers from workers in related industries due to incomplete information in the census records. For instance, some of the occupations we use to identify ironworkers, such as 'metal smelters', could refer to workers in other metal industries. However, the dominance of iron within the Swedish metal processing sector during this period means that this problem is not likely to be severe. 13 In other cases, potential ironworkers could be listed in the census as 'factory workers' or simply 'workers', which could lead us to erroneously exclude workers actually employed in the iron industry. In these cases, we take a conservative approach and only include workers whose occupations are expressly linked to the iron industry. 14

Note: Number of observations based on the occupational codings in 1880, for individuals who are linked between the 1880 and 1890 census.

The closure of almost one hundred production sites between 1880 and 1890 affected about a third of the sites that operated in 1880. To identify the effect of these closures on individual workers, we must first identify the workers who were employed at these sites and thus became displaced. Since the census data does not contain explicit information on the place of employment, we infer the likely place of employment based on other information available in census records. In the baseline analysis, we consider workers to be displaced if they are listed as

ironworkers at the time of the 1880 census and reside in a parish where all iron production sites shut down. We record 54 such instances of parishes where all iron production ceased due to site closures that occurred between 1880 and 1890. The right-hand panel of figure 3 illustrates the geographical distribution of these parishes, as well as those where iron production continued.

To verify the approach, we consider how observed site closures correspond to changes in iron industry employment in the census data. Figure 6 plots the change in the number of ironworkers in the census between 1880 and 1890 according to the status of the iron industry. We find a clear decline in ironworker employment in parishes where production reports indicate that iron production closed down. This suggests both that (1) the census data can accurately identify individual ironworkers, and that (2) the site closures obtained from the production report data are visible as displacement events in the census data. Figure 6 demonstrate that the structural change in Sweden affected regions differently, consistent with the conceptual framework in which a negative shock to productivity in some regions meant that other regions could expand production.

The baseline approach described above defines displacement events not at the level of the individual site, but at the level of the parish. This approach is preferred because it avoids incorrectly designating workers as displaced when, in reality, it is a question of reallocation between two nearby sites. When other sites in the same parish continue to operate, it is possible that sites close without separating workers from their original employment. In contrast, when all production within the parish ceases, this represents a clear instance of displacement. The parish-level approach does, however, have the potential drawback of discarding displacement events occurring in parishes where other sites continued to operate. In appendix G we discuss this issue further and present alternative approaches that leverage displacement events at the level of the individual site.

The census data does not include explicit information regarding individual in-

come or social status, but we can approximate the average annual earnings of individual workers using their occupations. We combine the Swedish census data with data on occupational earnings provided by Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012) for Norway, which was in a political union with Sweden during this period and had a similar occupational structure. Compared to the Swedish earnings data available for this period, this data offers the advantage of being available for a much larger number of occupations. We verify that the earnings reported in the Norwegian data are comparable to Swedish ones for those occupations where data is available in both countries in appendix B). The process used to link the earnings data to the census occupations is described in appendix C. While the Norwegian wage data are our preferred measure due to the political and geographical closeness to Sweden, we show that the results are similar when the occupational earnings data are instead based on the US occupational wage structure.

Since the occupational earnings data from Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012) represents a cross-sectional sample of occupations, it cannot be used to capture changes in occupational wages over time. This unfortunately is a limitation of virtually all studies in historical contexts. Nonetheless, the wage data provide a unified measure of workers' position in the occupational hierarchy, as approximated by the average occupational earnings in 1900. Therefore, as long as the relative earnings of occupations remained more or less stable between 1880 and 1900, the data allows us to quantify the relative impact of occupational changes over time for individuals and groups of workers.

## 3 Results

## 3.1 Occupations

We start by analyzing the effect of the plant closures on the probability that a worker remains employed in the iron industry following the displacement shock. Table 2 shows the estimates obtained by estimating equation 13 with a dummy variable indicating whether a worker is employed in the iron industry when observed in 1890. Consistent with expectations, the plant closures significantly reduced the likelihood that workers remain employed in the iron industry in 1890. In parishes where iron production continues, around 62 - 67% of the ironworkers observed in 1880 remained employed in the iron industry in 1890. By contrast, this probability is 23 - 25 percentage points lower for workers who initially resided in parishes where iron production ceased. The sharp and significant drop in the likelihood of continued employment in the iron industry indicates that workers were more likely to exit the iron industry and switch to different occupations following the initial displacement shock.

The occupational response reported in table 2 is illustrated graphically in figure 7 using the raw data. The figure plots the change in occupational categories

Although 62% of ironworkers who were not displaced remained in the occupation, the corresponding figure for displaced ironworkers is only around 37%. The figure also indicates that a large proportion of displaced ironworkers ended up in other types of non-specialized factory work (around 29%), despite this occupation making up less than 1% of total employment in 1890. 15 The second-largest share ended up in other metal industries, such as the manufacturing of consumer goods (around 16%), while a smaller share ended up as farm laborers or peasants (8%).

## 3.2 Migration

Many individuals remain employed in the iron industry, even though the production sites in their parish of residence closed down. Our conceptual framework suggests that migration might play an important role in reinstating labor within a given profession. Internal migration was quite common during the period under study for skilled professionals, with 25% of adult males moving to a different parish between 1880 and 1890. 16 Table 3 shows the effect of site closures on a dummy variable indicating whether the worker moved to a different parish between 1880 and 1890. The closure of the iron industry leads to a 25 percentage point increase in the migration rates among ironworkers, representing a doubling of the baseline migration rate. Interestingly, no such differences are visible among workers outside the iron industry between the treatment and control regions. The

out-migration for non-ironworkers in practice is slightly lower in parishes where the iron industry disappeared, suggesting that the changes in migration rates are specific to the iron industry workers.

## 3.3 Occupational earnings

Tables 2 and 3 suggest that displaced ironworkers responded to site closures both by changing their occupation and by migrating to a different parish. In some cases, displaced workers ended up in higher paid occupations, and in other cases they ended up in lower paid ones. 17 As illustrated in figure D.2 in the appendix, displaced workers saw more movement both up and down the occupational earnings distribution compared to their non-displaced peers. To analyze the overall effects of these adjustments, we study the effect of displacement on occupational earnings. Table 4 reports the effect of site closures on the occupational earnings at the time of the 1890 census. On average, displaced ironworkers in 1890 ended

up in occupations associated with around 9 - 10% lower earnings compared to the occupations of their non-displaced counterparts. The effect appears again to be specific to ironworkers, with no differences in the occupational earnings developments for workers outside of the iron industry between the treatment and control regions and is stable across both comparison groups. The results are similar when using occupational earnings in levels instead of log earnings as shown in table E.1 in the appendix.

Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for clustering at the parish level: ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗ p &lt; 0.05, ∗ p &lt; 0.10. Sample restricted to those between ages 18-59 at the time of the 1880 census. The income data is described in Appendix C. Observations without an reported occupation in 1890 are not included, thus the drop of observations compared to tables 2 and 3. Given that the likelihood of not reporting an occupation is fairly balanced between displaced and non-displaced ironworkers (2.31% and 2.11% likelihood respectively), the results are similar when assigning these observations a very low income.

## 3.4 Persistence

Finally, we use the 1900 census to analyze whether the effects on occupational changes, migration, and occupational earnings persist in the long run. The results might be somewhat attenuated, since we cannot observe all iron site closures between 1890 and 1900 and thus some of the ironworkers in the control group have been displaced when observed in 1900. Nonetheless, tables E.2 - E.4 in the appendix indicate that the effect of worker displacement on occupational changes, migration, and occupational earnings remain clearly visible in 1900. The effects on

occupational changes and migration in 1900 are remarkably similar to the effects observed in 1890, suggesting that most of the migration response and occupational changes took place shortly after the plant closures. The estimated effects on occupational earnings are also similar, suggesting that the initial displacement shock had long-term consequences extending 10 to 20 years after the event.

## 4 Robustness and sensitivity

## 4.1 Industrialization or stagnation

The empirical approach of this paper relies on the assumption that, had it not been for the displacement events, the outcomes of displaced and non-displaced ironworkers would have evolved similarly over time. One concern is that workers in control parishes are experiencing positive sides of the industrial expansion in the iron industry that may not have materialized in treated parishes, even if those sites had continued to operate. If these workers are also less likely to become displaced, then we may overestimate the negative effects of displacement. In this section, we present several approaches to investigate whether our estimates are driven by changes in the control regions or in expanding industrial sites.

First, we restrict the control group to parishes where the iron industry survived, but did not experience rapid industrialization between 1880 - 1890. These sites could offer a more credible counterfactual outcome for parishes where all sites close down, assuming that our treated parishes would have seen little industrial growth even if production had continued. In practice, many plants that did continue to operate beyond 1890 experienced relatively little change in employment between 1880 - 1890. While they did not close, they also did not expand employment or develop into industrial towns. 18 Tables F.7 to F.9 in the appendix split the

control group into parishes with positive employment growth in the iron sector between 1880 and 1890 and parishes with zero or negative employment growth. The displacement effect estimates are similar in both cases. As such, we conclude that the findings of this paper are not primarily driven by industrial expansions taking place in the control group.

Second, we account for differences in the initial characteristics of the local iron industry. Figure F.3 illustrates the distribution of total employment in 1880 by the status of the site in 1890. Notably, sites that closed down tended to have fewer workers on average compared to sites that continued. Similarly, figure F.4 illustrates the distribution of parishes by the number of active sites in 1880. It indicates that parishes where iron production shut down tended to have relatively few sites to begin with. The differences in firm size and firm concentration raises the concern that closing and non-closing sites might differ in their initial prospects for industrialization. To address this issue, we repeat the analysis using a smaller sample of parishes that share similar initial conditions. In particular, we drop all parishes with more than one production site or more than 30 ironworkers in 1880. The results are presented in the appendix tables F.3 and F.4, with estimates that are close to the main estimates presented in section 3. Hence, initial differences in the structure of the local iron industry do not appear to explain the findings of this paper.

Third, we account for differences in other observable characteristics at the parish and individual level. Table F.5 indicates that parishes where all sites ceased production differ slightly from parishes with surviving sites in terms of occupational structure at baseline (excluding ironworkers). In particular, closing parishes had a larger share of farmers and farmworkers (65 percent compared to 49 percent), and a smaller share of non-farm manual laborers (15 percent compared to 23 percent). Moreover, workers in treated parishes were slightly less likely to reside in an urban location, and were roughly one year older on average, compared

to workers in parishes where iron production continued. To account for these differences, we repeat the main analysis while controlling for the share of workers in different occupational categories at the parish level in 1880, as well as urban residency and age. The results are presented in table F.6, and are virtually identical to the main findings. Hence, observable differences in the initial occupational structure of parishes do not explain the results.

Fourth, we control for the distance to major ore mines in 1880 to account for differences in the initial industrialization prospects. While industrialization generally implied increasing demand for all major inputs, iron ore was particularly important as the basic input in pig iron production. Moreover, Eriksson (1957) notes that the transportation costs of iron ore were higher than for any other raw material used in iron production. Figure F.1 illustrates the geographical distribution of major ore fields in 1880. Notably, most mines are located in the central regions of Sweden, where iron production tended to continue. Therefore, one concern is that the results could be driven by initial differences in the prospects of centrally located parishes vis-'-vis a parishes located in the periphery, which would have affected worker outcomes even in the absence of site-closures. To address this issue, we control for the distance (in kilometers) from the parish to the closest major ore mine ( M i ). The results, presented in table F.1 in the appendix, are similar to the main findings. Hence, the clustering of surviving sites in central mining areas does not explain the findings of this paper.

Finally, we use a similar approach to account for cross-parish differences in local forest cover. Regions with a dense forest cover could be on different industrialization paths relative to areas characterized by plains, for example, due to differences in accessibility and population density. Simultaneously, technological and institutional developments tended to shift the focus from fuel accessibility as a primary constraint to the availability of water power and ore (see Eriksson, 1957), decreasing the viability of sites whose initial comparative advantage was

mainly related to an ample supply of local fuel sources. Simultaneously, these sites may have been disproportionately affected by growing input competition from the expanding timber industry. To account for this issue, we repeat the main analysis while controlling for the local forest cover as a percentage of land within a 10 km radius of iron production sites in each parish. The results, presented in F.2 in the appendix, are aligned with the main findings. Hence, differential trends in heavily forested areas do not appear to be driving the results.

## 4.2 Regional shocks and trends

A second concern is that differences in outcomes between the displaced, and nondisplaced ironworkers might reflect broader trends or shocks in these regions that extend beyond the iron sector. In general, the δ coefficient in equation (13) should capture such differences. However, this coefficient is estimated based on all nonironworkers, which might not form a reasonable counterfactual for ironworkers. To investigate whether broader regional trends within the manufacturing sector may explain our results, we repeat the analyses for manufacturing workers working with non-metallic inputs, such as carpenters and tailors. The results are displayed in tables F.10 and F.11 in the appendix. There are no effects of the iron plant closures on migration patterns or occupational earnings of manufacturing workers outside the iron industry. Hence, the results do not reflect different trends in the manufacturing industry between the treated and untreated regions, but instead are specific to manufacturing workers in the iron industry.

It is possible to take this analysis one step further by estimating a separate version of equation 13 for each occupation listed in the census, thus providing parish level 'displacement estimates' by occupation. Tables F.12 to F.14 in the appendix show the result of this exercise for all three outcomes. The migration response, occupational change, and occupational earnings losses are substantially stronger for those employed in the iron industry compared to the other occupations. This

robustness check further highlights that the changes within the affected parishes are specific to the iron industry and not driven by changes in the region's broader economic development. In addition, it highlights that the iron industry decline may have had limited spillovers to other occupations. The likely reason is that while the iron industry constituted the single-most concentrated industry in our iron regions, it still only made up 3.4% of total employment (or 7% of non-farm employment). This share is smaller in the treatment regions as highlighted above, since they had fewer and on average slightly smaller production sites as highlighted in the previous section. In these regions, the iron industry made up 1.2% (or 2.5% of non-farm) employment, explaining why the spillovers of the decline of the iron industry may have been limited at least in the short-run. While iron industry workers experienced the strong negative consequences, other occupations appear to have been comparatively unaffected.

Finally, one different possibility is that workers in the iron industry in surviving and closing sites were on different trajectories prior to the site closures. In this case, the differences-in-differences assumption may not hold. While we cannot use the 1880 - 1890 site closures to test this, since we have no observed data on worker outcomes prior to 1880, we can use the 1890 - 1900 closures as a placebo test. If sites that remained open and those that closed were on similar trajectories prior to the site closure, then the workers at the sites that closed between 1890 -1900 should have similar pre-trends between 1880 - 1890. To investigate this, we collected data on the closing dates for all sites that remained open in 1890 according to the mining books from external sources. Out of the 239 sites that remained in operation by 1890, a further 40 closed between 1890 and 1900. 19 Appendix table F.18 estimates the baseline model with treatment based on site closures between 1890 - 1900 to study if pre-trends are visible in the years prior

to closure between ironworkers in treated and untreated parishes. There are no significant differences in the outcomes of the ironworkers between 1880 - 1890, highlighting that worker of surviving and closing production sites were not on different long-term trajectories prior to closure.

## 4.3 Worker selection

A third concern is that endogenous worker sorting before 1880 might affect the estimates. While the descriptive statistics presented in appendix table F.15 suggest that displaced and non-displaced workers shared roughly similar characteristics in 1880 in terms of age, employment status and earnings, there could be unobservable differences driving selection. For instance, the most talented workers may have left the closing sites prior to their closing date, thus leaving us with a negatively selected sample of employees when a site closes.

One way to investigate this concern is to compare the estimates for sites that shut down shortly after we first observed the workers in 1880 with the estimates based on sites that closed in the late 1880s, which would arguably be more difficult to predict in 1880. Appendix table F.16 shows the estimates for the split sample. There are no significant differences in the displacement effect estimates for the plants that closed in 1880 - 1884 and those that closed in 1885 - 1889, suggesting that worker selection based on short-term plant prospects is unlikely to drive the results. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that the migration of highly skilled workers into the expanding sites is driving the results, we restrict the sample in appendix table F.17 to workers still living in their parish of birth at the time of the 1880 census. The results are again similar. Related to this, appendix figure F.5 shows that the employee level counts in the mining reports do not decline in the years leading up to plant closure, further alleviating our concerns about anticipatory sorting.

## 4.4 Spatial level of the analysis

A different concern is that the results may depend on the spatial unit of analysis at which we assign workers to treatment or control groups. The model in section 2.2 highlights that the effects of the site closures are felt within the local labor markets, but the question is what a good approximation for the local labor market is. The baseline analysis defines parishes as the local labor market, which might be either too small or too large in practice.

On average, the parish seems to be a reasonable approximation of the size of a local labor market. Over 60% of the ironworkers living within the affected parish actually lived in the very place where the ironwork was located. As such, most ironworkers lived very close to their place of work and commuting even between the various places within the parishes appears to have been relatively uncommon. Appendix G investigates this more formally, and shows that the results are very similar when assigning treatment at the place-level instead of the parish level.

At the same time, workers might be willing to commute to other parishes if a different surviving ironwork is located just across the border, in which case the parish might be too small of a geographical unit. To investigate whether this may play an important role, table F.20 in the appendix shows the estimates separately for displaced ironworkers living a parish that bordered a parish where at least one ironwork remained open, and those workers that had no other ironworks remaining open in neighboring parishes. The estimates are similar across the two groups, highlighting that sites that remained open in other nearby parishes could not substitute for the closure of the ironworks in their own parish. As such, using the parish as the unit of analysis seems to provide a reasonable approximation for the extent of the local labor market.

## 4.5 Sample attrition and US occupational earnings

A fifth concern is that workers most severely affected by displacement are more likely to leave the sample. For example, losing occupational status and income may have adverse health effects, leading to higher mortality rates. Furthermore, displacement could serve as an incentive to migrate abroad. To address this issue, we examine whether the displacement shock affected the probability of workers remaining or dropping out of the sample. The results of this attrition analysis are presented in appendix table F.19. We find no significant difference between displaced and non-displaced ironworkers, which suggests that selective attrition through mortality and out-migration is unlikely to drive the results.

Finally, the baseline occupational earnings estimates are based on the 1900 Norwegian wage structure as mentioned in section 2. While Norway and Sweden were in a political union during the period and the wages were similar in occupations where information on both countries was available as shown in appendix B, one might be concerned that the results are driven by particularities in the Norwegian wage structure. To investigate this, table F.21 in the appendix shows the results when using occupational earnings from the 1901 US Cost of Living survey (Preston and Haines, 1991) which have been previously digitalized and matched to the NAPP occupational structure by Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012). The decline in occupational earnings following displacement is even somewhat stronger when using the US occupational earnings instead of the Norwegian occupational earnings, highlighting that the results are also not driven by any particularities in the Norwegian wage structure.

## 5 Extensions

## 5.1 The next generation

Although the results presented in section 3 show that displaced workers experienced long-term negative consequences, it is also interesting to consider whether the displacement shock affected the outcomes of subsequent generations. To investigate this, we study a sample consisting of the male children of workers observed in 1880. 20 To ensure a sufficiently large sample of children old enough to have observable labor market outcomes, we focus on the outcomes measured in the 1900 census. We restrict the sample to children between 0 and 10 at the time of the 1880 census, which means that the children will be between 20 and 30 years old in 1900. 21 We estimate the model in equation 14, which is similar to equation 13 but with the occupation and ironworker status on the right-hand side based on the occupation of the household head in 1880.

$$Y i = δD i + γ D ( i × W Father i ) + occupation Father i +region + i ϵ i (14)$$

Table 5 shows the effect of worker displacement on the outcomes of children in 1900. Column 1 indicates a weakly negative effect on the probability that the child is employed as an ironworker. Although 24% of the sons of non-displaced ironworkers worked in the iron industry in 1900, only 16% of the sons of displaced ironworkers did. At the same time, column 2 reveals a significant 20.4% increase in migration among children of displaced workers, which is similar to the effects

on their parents. Given the relatively high baseline mobility of the children of ironworkers during this period (49% lives in a different parish in 1900 compared to 1880), few children of displaced workers still lived in their parish of birth by the time of the 1900 census. Hence, migration seems to be an essential and lasting response to plant closures. At the same time, no such migration responses are visible for the children of non-ironworkers in the parishes where the iron industry closed. These estimates again highlight that the effects are specific to the iron sector and that broader regional trends in migration patterns do not drive the results.

Finally, column 3 of table 5 presents the estimates of the worker displacement on children's occupational earnings in 1900. The estimated effect on occupational earnings is comparatively small and statistically insignificant, suggesting that displacement did not strongly affect the occupational outcomes of the worker's children. The estimates are somewhat imprecise due to the relatively small sample of 146 male children of displaced workers (out of which 111 report an occupation in

1900). 22 However, the estimates are substantially smaller compared to the longrun parental occupational earnings losses presented in table E.4 in the appendix. As such, the effects of worker displacement do not seem to affect the earnings of the next generation, although they are somewhat less likely to be employed in the iron industry.

## 5.2 The migration response

The conception framework and results in section 3 suggest that migration was an essential part of the adjustment process following site closures. One question is how the migration decision is related to other effects of displacement. Around 43% of the displaced ironworkers had migrated to a different parish by 1890 and this rises to 54% by 1900. Although the decision to migrate is subject to selection, comparing migrant and non-migrant outcomes may offer some insights into whether migration can mitigate the negative effects of the displacement shock.

First, we consider the type of locations that the migrants moved to. Table 6 shows how the migration patterns of displaced ironworkers differed from those of non-displaced ironworkers. Notably, displaced ironworkers were more likely to migrate to a different province (ln), a suggesting that displacements engendered more than just local migration responses. The mean (median) moving distance of displaced ironworkers, conditional on migration, was 84 (50) km. In terms of destinations, displaced ironworkers were less likely to move to urban areas compared to non-displaced workers. In fact, only 3% of the displaced ironworkers that migrated moved to an urban area which is far below the urbanization level of Sweden in 1890 (18%). As such, the displacement of worker in the iron industry did not contribute significantly to the large-scale migration to cities observed in Sweden during this period. Instead, displaced ironworkers were more likely to

move to an iron-producing region compared to non-displaced ironworkers in 1890.

Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for clustering at the parish level: ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗ p &lt; 0.05, ∗ p &lt; 0.10. The table compares the differences in migration destinations for all workers and ironworkers in the treatment and control parishes, conditional on moving away from the parish of residence in 1880. Control mean refers to the destination characteristics of ironworkers in the control regions that migrated between 1880 and 1890 to a different parish.

The next question is whether the migration decision mitigated the adverse effects of displacement. Although migration is selective, comparing migrant and non-migrant outcomes may offer some insights into whether migration protected workers from the displacement shocks. We estimate equation 15, which is similar to equation 13 except for the addition of an interaction between the displacement shock and a dummy variable M i , indicating whether the individual has moved to a different parish since being first observed in 1880.

$$Y i = δD i + γ D ( i × W i ) + µ D ( i × W i × M i ) + occupation i +region + i ϵ i (15)$$

The results are presented in table 7. Columns 1 and 2 suggest that migration is associated with slightly smaller displacement effects in 1890. This could indicate that some workers who migrated found new jobs in the iron industry. However, the estimated interaction effects are small and not statistically significant. As such, migration did not fully compensate for the negative effects of the displacement

shock in the short run.The interaction between migration and outcomes changes if we focus on worker outcomes in 1900, which are presented in columns 3 and 4. By 1900, the career developments significantly differ between displaced ironworkers that did and did not migrate. Furthermore, the estimates in column 4 suggests that the occupational earnings of displaced workers that decided to migrate are now similar to those of non-displaced workers. These estimates suggest that migration may have been a viable strategy to mitigate the impact of the original displacement shock in the long run.

Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for clustering at the parish level: ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗ p &lt; 0.05, ∗ p &lt; 0.10. Sample restricted to those between ages 18 - 59 (49) at the time of the 1880 census for the first (last) two columns and parishes with iron production in 1880 to save space. To allow for comparison of the sample of movers, both for the outcomes in 1890 and 1900 we base 'M' on whether individuals migrated between 1880 - 1890. The results for the outcomes in 1900 are virtually identical if we instead define 'M' based on migration between 1880 - 1900 instead. The control means refer to the outcomes of non-displaced ironworkers in 1890 and 1900 respectively.

## 6 Conclusion

We study the industrial transformation of the Swedish iron industry in the late 19th century and find that many ironworkers were negatively affected by the closure of the old iron production sites. Ironworkers displaced by the production site closures between 1880 and 1890 left the iron industry at higher rates compared to

non-displaced workers and ended up in lower-paid professions. We estimate that displaced workers ended up in jobs with 10% lower occupational earnings compared to non-displaced workers. While these losses do not quite offset the average wage growth in this period, the downward movement within the occupational income distribution implies that displaced ironworkers missed out on a significant share of the real earning growth of Swedish manufacturing workers between 1880 and 1890.

Many ironworkers responded to displacement through migration. We find that displaced ironworkers were 25 percentage points more likely to migrate to a different parish than non-displaced workers to cope with the local labor market shock. This response seems to have been effective in the long run. Although the shortterm earnings losses associated with displacement are similar for migrants and non-migrants, one decade later, the earnings of the displaced ironworkers who chose to migrate are similar to those of non-displaced ironworkers. Furthermore, we find no adverse effects on the earnings of children of displaced workers. Hence, although industrialization had long-lasting consequences for the displaced workers, the displacement did not generate long-term scarring effects for the subsequent generations.

The occupational earnings losses we find are comparable to those in the contemporary plant closure literature, which is remarkable given the lack of education and retraining programs to mitigate the costs of job loss in this period. One explanation may be the importance of regional migration as an adaptation mechanism. Furthermore, as noted by Sderberg (2000), the social consequences of the deo struction of the old Swedish iron industry must be interpreted in light of the simultaneous industrial expansion that occurred elsewhere. This context sets the event studied in this paper apart from many similar examples of mass displacement, such as the steel crises that affected the English midlands, the Ruhr area in Germany, the Rust Belt in the US, and the Swedish Bergslagen in the 1970s

and 1980s, where the plant closures coincided with a wider contraction of the manufacturing industry.

Since this is the first paper to quantitatively study the consequences of worker displacement during the industrial revolution, we cannot compare our estimates to those of other countries. Nevertheless, the findings of this paper provide a rational motivation for the early social mobilization against technological change, such as the Luddite movement in Great Britain, as we find that displaced workers suffer permanent losses in terms of average occupational earnings. At the same time, the unions and political parties that grew out of Scandinavia's industrial revolution were less technology-averse than the United Kingdom. Moreover, historical records indicate that opposition to technology was seldom explicit in Swedish union-orchestrated demonstrations in the early 20th century (Molinder, Karlsson and Enflo, 2021). As such, the direct negative consequences of industrialization for Swedish workers may still have been relatively mild compared to the experiences in other European countries.

The fate of individual iron production sites in Sweden during the period studied in this paper (1860-1890) was influenced by a complex interplay of economic and geographical factors. As mentioned in section 2.1, the traditional Swedish iron industry consisted of hundreds of small-scale production units. These sites were distributed across a large area across central Sweden, as illustrated in figure 3. The proliferation of sites was partly the result of legislation that explicitly regulated the scale of individual production sites. Moreover, competition for local forest resources used in fuel production contributed to the spread of sites over larger areas. However, as the technological and institutional conditions changed in the mid-19th century, the nature of these constraints changed, resulting instead in an environment that favored large-scale production centered on fewer sites.

To understand why certain sites survived while others closed down, it is helpful to begin by examining differences in their initial conditions that might predict survival. First, one might expect that initial differences in the performance of sites in 1860 would provide a rough prediction for the scope for future expansion. As such, the centralization of production would likely lead to production being concentrated to sites that were already comparatively large, and relatively more productive. In figure A.1, we test this hypothesis by studying how the survival of individual production sites over time (measured in the year of closure) is related to various measures of site performance and size in 1860. For this exercise, we have digitized additional detailed production data for a subsample of 138 sites that were operating in Orebro county in the year 1860. ¨

Panel A of figure A.1 suggests that initially larger sites tended to survive slightly longer. However, the difference is small. Sites that survived at least until 1895 had roughly 12 workers in 1860, while sites that closed down within

the first ten years had roughly 10 workers. However, panels B and C suggest a somewhat stronger relationship for differences in initial output and average labor productivity. Finally, panel D illustrates how the survival of blast furnaces in the period 1860-1895 is related to the days of burning time in 1860. The burning time is a good measure of capacity utilization. It indicates that sites that were used more intensively in 1860 were more likely to survive. This evidence is consistent with the notion that production concentrated to sites that were already relatively more productive. However, there is also a considerable overlap, with many sites that were relatively unproductive in 1860 still surviving at least until 1895.

In addition to the initial characteristics of the production sites themselves, it is likely the survival of sites depended on geographical factors. In particular, the shift to larger-scale production units required greater access to raw materials (most importantly iron ore and fuel), as well as local hydropower resources (used to power bar-iron hammers, blast furnace blowers and hoisting machines). Eriksson (1957) notes that, even after the introduction of steam engines, most sites continued to rely primarily on hydropower due to its cost-efficiency. In figure A.2, we study how the survival of sites that were operating in 1860 depends on measures of local access to ore and charcoal, as well as access to local hydropower resources.

Panel A of figure A.2 compares sites that are above and below the median in terms of distance to major ore fields in 1860. It indicates that locations with greater access to this basic input were around 10 percentage points more likely to still be in operation by 1895. Panel B instead compares sites that are above and below the median in terms of forest cover in 1850, which serves as a proxy for local access to charcoal. It indicates that sites had greater access were slightly less likely to survive. This mirrors the discussion in section 2 of a declining importance of local forest resources. Finally, panel C compares sites based on the average annual hydrological discharge associated with the location of the production site (a proxy of hydropower potential). It indicates that sites with better access to hydropower

were around 10 percentage points more likely to still be in operation by 1895.

While the evidence in the figures suggest that external and geographic features predict plant closures, the exact timing of the closures remains hard to predict. As such, the access to natural resources, while clearly predictive of which plants close down between 1860 - 1895, are not sufficiently powerful to predict which sites closure in exact census intervals. The reason is that many iron production sites fail to expand in this period and close in the subsequent decades, with the precise closing date being hard to determine based on geographic constraints alone. As such, we highlight that the results are robust to the inclusion of the various geographic characteristics in section 4.1, but do not use these characteristics separately as an IV to predict site-closure in any given decade-interval.

Note: The figure illustrates the relationship between the sites' recorded year of closure and various baseline site characteristics measured in 1860. The figures is based on sites belonging to the county of Orebro, for which additional site-level information has been collected and digitized. The category 'after 1895' includes all sites which remain open at the end of the period covered in our data, and for which we therefore do not have a recorded closing date.

Note: Panel A illustrates the share of sites still operating over time, comparing sites located at a distance from major ore mines that is greater or lower than the median distance (see the map in figure F.1). Similarly, panel B compares sites with a percentage of forest cover above or below the median (see map in figure F.2), and panel B compares sites located in areas with an average hydrological discharge above or below the median. 59

## B Comparing Norwegian and Swedish earnings data

In this paper, we use Norwegian data on average annual earnings by occupation in 1900 to quantify the economic significance of changes in occupational status. The use of Norwegian data in the Swedish context is not ideal since the relative earnings of different occupational groups could differ between the two countries. However, given that data on the annual earnings of Swedish workers is not available at a sufficiently detailed level, we use Norwegian data as the second-best option. That said, the Norwegian data likely offers a good approximation due to the large structural similarities and high level of integration between the Swedish and Norwegian economies at the time (Sweden and Norway were in a political, economic and monetary union until 1905). Table B.1 reports the average annual earnings of different categories of Norwegian workers in 1900 provided by Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012), as well as the average annual earnings of similar categories of Swedish workers in 1900 provided by Bagge, Lundberg and Svennilson (1933). Table B.1 suggests that, for those worker categories where a comparison is possible, the Norwegian and Swedish earnings data appear to be well aligned.

Note: The Norwegian data is from Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012) (converted to Swedish Kronor using the exchange rate for year 1900 provided by Klovland (2004)). The Swedish data is from Bagge, Lundberg and Svennilson (1933) who collected information on wages between 1860 and 1930. The reported earnings are adjusted for in-kind payments. The annual earnings of male agricultural day-laborers is calculated by multiplying the daily wage rate (markeg˚ng a rate) by 297 (assuming a six day working week).

* To calculate the annual earnings of owner-occupier farmers we divide the total value of the 1900 harvest (after correcting for input costs following Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012)) by the number of farm owners in Sweden in 1900 obtained from Bidrag till Sveriges officiella statistik (BiSOS) 1851-1917.

## C Imputation of earnings data

The linkage of the historical occupation to the wage data comes from Abramitzky,

Boustan and Eriksson (2012). This data is coded according to the same histori-

cal 5-digit occhisco classification used by IPUMS International for the digitalized Swedish censuses, which means that the historical occupations are standardized according to the same 5-digit occupational classification. For 73% of the observations, we directly observe the occupational earnings data from Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012), out of which a substantial fraction (73%) are farming households. For the remaining 27%, we average the earnings from occupations within the same 1-/2-/3- digit historical ISCO classification with available wage data, weighting the occupation by the frequency at which they are observed. Using the 3-digit classification pushes the matching rate up to 95% and with the 2-digit classification to 99%. Finally, we use wages on the 1-digit ISCO classification level to obtain a 100% matching rate on wages. The occupation for which we have to rely on the 1-digit occupational structure are not very obviously selected, with the 5 largest occupations being accountants, charcoal burners, hotel managers, musicians and 'other jewelry workers'. However, the results are virtually identical if we restrict attention to the occupations for which wages are known at the 3-digit level.

To investigate the applicability of the Norwegian wage structure to the Swedish context, we compared the Norwegian wages with the wage levels which are known for a select number of Swedish occupations in appendix B. Finally, for some individuals the occupation is classified as missing, but we know from the occupational string that these individuals were living off church charity or begging. For these individuals, we assign the earnings to be the lowest observed earnings among the occupations, which are domestic servants.

Given that the likelihood of not reporting an occupation is fairly balanced between displaced and non-displaced ironworkers (2.31% and 2.11% likelihood respectively), the results are similar when assigning these observations zero income.

Figure F.1: Major ore mines in 1880

<!-- image -->

Note: The figure illustrates the location of major iron mines operating in 1880, including the reported output of each mine in that year (in thousand tonnes of ore). It also displays the status of iron production in parishes between 1880 and 1890. The data on ore mines comes from historical records, provided by Statistics Sweden (BiSOS C, Bergshantering 1858-1910), which we have digitized and geolocated. We attempted to geolocate all mines with an annual output exceeding roughly 500 thousand metric tons (100 thousand centners). Out of 50 such mines listed in the records, we managed to find precise geographical coordinates for 49. Together, these 'major mines' accounted for more than 80% of the total iron ore produced in Sweden in 1880.

Note: The figure illustrates the distribution of forests across Sweden around 1846. The original map (panel A) was created by King Charles XV of Sweden while serving as crown prince, with the help of local advisers. We digitized the map (panel B) and extracted the share of forested area within a 10 kilometer radius of each production site to obtain a measure of local forest cover.

The table illustrates key differences in the baseline share of different occupational categories (excluding ironworkers), urban residency, occupational earnings and age between parishes that continued to produce iron between 1880 and 1890, and parishes where production stopped. The sample consists of male workers residing in parishes producing iron in 1880. All differences are statistically significant.

In this analysis, we repeat the main analysis while controlling for baseline characteristics measured in 1880, as listed in table F.5. Differences in occupations and earnings enter as parish-level means, while 'Urban place of residence' and 'Age' are included at the individual level. Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for clustering at the parish level: ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗ p &lt; 0.05, ∗ p &lt; 0.10.

Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for clustering at the parish level: ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗ p &lt; 0.05, ∗ p &lt; 0.10. Sample restricted to those between ages 18 - 59 at the time of the 1880 census. The lists of occupations considered as ironworkers are displayed in table 1.

Figure F.5: Worker counts prior to plant closure

<!-- image -->

Note: The figure displays estimates of site-level employment in the years leading up to closure. We run the following regression emp i,t = ∑ 30 t =1 δ t + γ i + ε i,t , where emp i,t is the number of workers employed at site i in the period t years prior to closure (i.e. the last year of operation), and δ t captures the the number of workers employed t is years prior to closure relative to the baseline t = 0).

Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for clustering at the parish level: ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗ p &lt; 0.05, ∗ p &lt; 0.10. Sample restricted to those between ages 18 - 59 at the time of the 1880 census. The treatment variable 'D' is based on whether the remaining iron sites closed between 1890 and 1900. 40 out of the 239 sites that remained in operation in 1890 closed between 1890 - 1900. Since the mining book series end around 1890, we base the closing dates on external sources. Fortunately, the cultural impact of the 'great death of forges' means that excellent documentation exists for many sites from museums, historical societies, and the national archives. To avoid endogeneity in terms of which sites has historical coverage, we used a single list as baseline documentation, called 'Lista ver jrnbruk, o a hyttor och smedjor i Sverige' to determine production site closures between 1890 and 1900. For 17% of the production sites that remained in operation until at least 1890 according to the mining books, we cannot establish a closing date using the outside sources. We assume that these sites continue to operate past 1900. The estimates are robust to excluding parishes that contain any of these sites with uncertainty around their closure date.

Some codes used to describe Swedish occupations, such as 'husbandmen or cottars' and 'customs officers' are not used in the digitalization of the US and Norwegian census data, and thus have no matching wages. As such, the number of observations is slightly smaller than in the occupational earnings table in the main text (table 4). The majority of missing earnings data (70%) concerns the ''husbandmen or cottars' category. Replacing their earnings with the earnings of 'Livestock workers' from Abramitzky, Boustan and Eriksson (2012) slightly increases the displacement effects.

Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for clustering at the parish level: ∗∗∗ p &lt; 0.01, ∗∗ p &lt; 0.05, ∗ p &lt; 0.10. Sample restricted to those between ages 18 - 59 at the time of the 1880 census. Estimates based on a model with occupation and parish-fixed effects to account for more flexible differences in trends at the parish level between 1880 - 1890. As such, the 'D' estimate disappears since it's colinear with the parish-fixed effects.

## G Alternative treatment definitions

In this section we use an alternative approach to identify displaced workers. In general, a worker is considered displaced if he has an occupation that is connected to the iron industry, and resides in a location where all iron production is shut down. In the main specifications, we use the parish as the main geographical unit to identify such locations. This approach is based on the mild assumption that workers reside in the same parish where they are employed. However, it also assumes that any worker residing in a parish where production continues cannot have been displaced. This ignores a number of site closures between 1880 and 1890 that took place in parishes with continuing production. To address this issue, we use an alternative definition of treatment capable of exploiting individual closures.

The census records list a narrower geographical definition referred to as the 'place of residence' (hemort). This measure allows us to identify individuals residing in the immediate town or village where the site is located, or at the production site itself. Therefore, we can produce a direct match between each production site and individual ironworkers. For each parish containing at least one production site, we list each recorded place name mentioned in the census and manually assign it (when possible) to a specific production site. In tables G.1 to G.3 we repeat the main analysis using this alternative geographic treatment indicator. When using the transcribed place of residence (hemort) to define the geographical dimension of treatment, the estimated migration response is significantly smaller compared to the main specification. This is expected. Displaced workers are less likely to migrate to a new parish if there are other iron producers still operating in their home parish. Otherwise, the results are similar to the main specifications.

The narrower geographical definition allows us to exploit a larger number of closures but is also associated with certain trade-offs. First, the size of the geographical units vary significantly across cases. For example, the place of reference

can sometimes refer to the production site itself and sometimes to the whole village where a furnace is located. Second, it makes the assumption that workers reside very near, if not at, the actual production site itself. This places strict (and unrealistic) limits on the mobility of workers, who may, in fact, live in other nearby locations. Therefore, we also use an alternative approach that combines the parish and the place of residence. This measure identifies any ironworker as displaced if he is assigned as such by either definition. This allows us to maintain the preferred parish-level definition for the most part, without throwing away the variation caused by additional displacement events in parishes where some iron production continued. The results are presented in table G.4, and are similar to the main findings.

## Expanded definition of ironworker

Second, we create a broader occupational definition of ironworkers by expanding the occupations regarded as ironworkers with those listed in table G.5. By expanding the occupational definition, we may succeed in including a larger number of displaced ironworkers, but also risk diluting the treatment variable by including workers belonging to other sectors. Therefore, we combine the broader occupational definition with the narrower geographical definition described in section G. The results are presented in table G.6, and are similar to the main findings.

Table G.5: Additional occupations classified as iron industry workers

| Occupation                                        |   Observations |

Finally, in table G.7 we use the transcribed place of residence (hemort) in

combination with the parish-level treatment, as well as the expanded set of occupations. Again, the results are similar.
