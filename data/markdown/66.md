## Introduction: The Labour Process

On 13 March 1930, Michail Shkunov, A Moscow plumber, finally got a job. When he left the labour exchange, the doors closed and Soviet commentators  pronounced  that  this  event  symbolized  the  end  of  mass unemployment in the USSR. Since that time, the provision of regular paid labour and a permanent occupation for all who are able to work has been one  yardstick  which  has  been  used  to  legiti  mate  Soviet  society  as  a socialist state. This book seeks to discover the extent to which this claim is true  and  whether  there  are  any  systemic  fe  atures  of  Soviet  society  in distinction from capitalism which lead to the provision of full employment.

Almost all research in the West on employment (or unemployment) and the  labour  process  is  based  on  capitalist  market-type  societies.  Levels  of unemployment are seen to derive from the working of the market economy: to be the result of structural insufficiencies in demand, of the overpricing or immobility of labour or-as seen by Marxist critics-to be consequent on the laws of capitalist accumulation creating a reserve army of idle people. Employment  and  the  labour  process  in  socialist  states  must  be  seen  in  a completely diffe rent economic, ideological and political context. It will be established in this book that the Soviet economy is one of full employment with  the  highest  rate  of  paid  employment  known  to  history.  This  is considered to be a consequence of the operation of the economic mechanism and political system. In distinction from market economies, it will be shown that in the socialist economy there is no effective propensity to increase the profitability of capital by reducing labour costs.

The  contemporary  'labour  process'  approach  emphasizes  the  role  of labour as the creator of wealth in the context of the exploitation of labour through  the  competition  of  capitals.  Numerous  policies  are  seen  to  stem from  this  in  the  eyes  of  western  labour  process  writers. 1 Exploitation  of workers  by  capital  prevents  work  from  being  the  expression  of  a  human need; coercion of labour by management is ensured by depriving workers of control-scientific  management'  and  automation  lead  to  deskilling,  to dependency on management, to redundancies and a pool of surplus labour which enfeebles the political resistance of workers.

This kind of approach cannot be applied without considerable modification  to  socialist  states.  It  is  not  appropriate  here  to  explain  the Soviet  economic system 2 but  some  of  the  major  distinctions  from  market capitalism  may  be  noted.  The  competition  of  capitals  is  replaced  by administr ative direction of accumulati on; wholesale and consumer prices are fixed by planning organs. Output and product mix is not determined by market  conditions  and  demand  but  by  an  administr  atively  assigned economic plan. From the point of view of the enterprise, the output plan is the main indicator of success. There is a quasi-labour market in which the price  of  labour  may  respond  to  shortages  within  fairly  strict  wage  diffe rentials  laid  down  by  the  planners  and  the  total  wage  fund  is  given  to  a production enterprise. There is little incentive to reduce labour costs or the number  of  workers  employed;  on  the  contrary,  the  enterprise's  interest  is served by the inflation of the wage fund. In this context, the quasi-labour market operates at the industry and enterprise level. Full employment and the  absence  of  administr  ative  restrictions  on  mobility  between  jobs  give rise to labour mobility between enterprises. To maintain a large and reliable workforce, enterprises seek to reward their employees with better facilities to  earn  wages  and  provide  payments  in  kind.  This  gives  rise  to  the differentiation  of  conditions  and  opportunities  not  as  under  capitalism  on the  basis  of  a  monopoly  of  skill  or  by  bargaining  position  but  by  the industry and enterprise in which a person works.

Turning  from  the  economic  mechanism  to  the  political  and  ideological spheres,  there  are  also  major  dissimilarities  between  the  USSR  and  the West. The government accepts responsibility for the provision of occupations  for  the  population  of  working  age  and  for  a  job  thought appropriate for the worker. Marxist-Leninist ideology regards work not only as an instrumentality to provide income to meet needs, but as a human need in  itself.  A  priority  of  policy  and  one  which  confers  legitimacy  on  the leadership is to provide employment-albeit, if necessary, at the expense of efficiency. Trade unions operate on an industry-wide basis and their prime job  is  to  fulfil  the  plan-to  increase  output-rather  than  to  support  some sectional interest. The  Communist  Party  plays  an  administrative  role unknown to political  parties  in  western  societies:  it  functions  not  only  to integrate the worker but also seeks to stimulate the efficiency of management and the productivity of the employee.

It  will  be  shown in the chapters that follow that the Soviet economy is one of full employment and labour shortage. This affects the labour process by strengthening the position of labour vis-à-vis management, and weakening the 'control' of management. It leads to a 'slack' labour regime, with infractions of labour discipline such as absenteeism and low effort. In order to improve efficiency and labour productivity, the economic planners and  management  have  to  devise  new  and  diffe  rent  methods  of  labour motivation. These involve collecti ve financial incentive schemes, the use of moral stimulati on, the development of a collect ive consciousness on the part  of  the  workforce,  and  greater  reliance  on  administrative  control.  A dilemma facing the Soviet economic and political leadership is whether it can  increase  efficiency  in  general  and  labour  productivity  in  particular within the confines of a full-employment economy.

The  approach  taken  in  this  book  departs  from  the  labour  process paradigm  associated  with  the  followers  of  Braverman.  First,  it  takes  into account  the  dominant  ideology  defining  the  values  which  work  and  nonwork  have  for  the  dominant  classes  and  groups.  Since  the  time  of  the Reformation, it has been widely held that work is a major component in the ethic of capitalism. Work, however, in its modern form of paid employment is  an instrumentality, it is a means to the achievement of income. This, in turn, is seen to provide satisfaction in terms of standard of living or status by occupation. While it is true that some commentators see paid labour as being  psychologically  and  socially  desirable,  in  the  West  policy-makers tend to give priority to the provision of income as a substitute for work for those  who  are  voluntarily  (e.g.  the  sick,  young  and  old  people,  much domestic labour) or involuntarily 'unemployed' (i.e. those actively 'seeking paid labour' but unable to get it). It is hypothes ized in this study that policy makers in socialist states have a different attitude to the use of labour. Many western Marxists regard paid labour as alienating and seek to transcend it under  socialism  by  the  substitution  of  leisure 3 for  work.  The  writings  of Marx and Lenin will be cited to show that they regarded labour as being part of human liberation. This element of Marxism, it is argued, provides an ideological environment which conditions policy-makers to give priority to providing employment (rather than income) in Soviet society.

Secondly, labour history has its own particular dimension which shapes popular  aspirations  to  work  of  workers  and  non-workers.  Historically, Soviet  industrialization  has  placed  great  store  on  mobilizing  labour  as  an

econonic resource; hence the value of work could be interpreted as an effect of the economic system in its legitimation of wage labour. It might therefore be regarded not as a fundamental value in Marxism, but as an instrumentality (similar to  the  'Protestant  work  ethic')  to  induce  people  to accept a system of paid labour. The work culture of Tsarist Russia, shaped by the relatively short working year of the traditional peasant and inherited by Soviet power, has to be taken into account.

Thirdly, I consider that prominence has to be given to the political and economic system based on public ownership of property and which accepts responsibility for the level of economic activity, including investment and employment.  In  the  absence  of  a  market,  administrative  politics  in  the USSR dominate economics, and administrative solutions have to be found for  economic  problems.  One  must  attempt  to  discover  the  forces  which drive a socialist economy. Under the present conditions of Soviet planning, industrial enterprises are not subject to the constraint of a market, they are not  threatened  by  bankruptcy  or  takeover. They  seek  to  maximize  output, and wage cost is relatively unimportant. One must consider whether a full employment economy is simply the result  of  intentional  decisions  by  the government or whether the operation of the economic mechanism creates a surplus of jobs in relation to the labour supply. There are obvious economic inefficiencies involved in a low-wage/high-employment economy: we shall investigate the extent to which under employment and low productivity are systemic properties of Soviet planning and the scope fo r improvement.

The  book  describes  the  context  of  the  labour  process  and  attempts  to locate various theoretical approaches in an empirical context. The book has the following plan. In the first chapter, I consider the nature of the dominant value  system  of  Marxism-Leninism  as  it  has  developed  in  the  Soviet Union with respect to labour and employment. In Chapter 2, I outline the evolution of a full-employment labour economy in the Soviet Union and the extent to which one may say that 'full employment' has been achieved. Next I  consider  the  ways  that  the  labour  force  is  allocated  to  jobs  and  the mobility of labour. Various forms of unemployment are analysed in Chapter 4 including 'frictional' movements due to turnover and structural unemployment as found in certain geographical regions. In Chapter 5 our concern is with labour productivity and administrative measures to improve it. In Chapter 6 we turn to consider the under-utilization of labour and the phenomenon  of  'labour  shortage'  and  the  effects  of  technological  change

with respect to redundancy or what I have termed 'displacement' ( vysvobozhdenie ). In Chapter 7 some conclusions are made concerning the Soviet  labour  market.  Next  we  examine  the  'brigade'  system  of  work organization  devised  to  increase  the  efficient  use  of  labour.  Finally,  I attempt  to  generalize  about  the  labour  market,  full  employment  and  a shortage  economy  by  locating  labour  in  a  system  of  societal  exchanges. These are: the resource mobilization system, the political support system, the loyalty solidarity commitment system, the labour consumption market system,  the  allocative standard  system  and  the  authority  legitimation system.  While  these  systems  are  common  to  all  societies,  the  Soviet  one does not function in the same way as under capitalism. Its peculiarities and interests promoting full employment are described in the last chapter.

## 1 Soviet Marxism and the Ending of Mass Unemployment

## Work and Employment in Soviet Ideology

In their approach to the labour process, the leaders of the USSR have been influenced in their policy and thinking by Marxist assumptions. For Marx, the maintenance and reproduction of material life is the prime human need. In a well-known passage in The German Ideology, Marx writes: 'The first historical act is . . . the production of material life itself. This is indeed. . . a fundamental condition  of  all  hist  ory,  which  today,  as  thousands  of  years ago,  must  be  accomplished  every  day  and  every  hour  merely  in  order  to sustain human life.' 1

In  Marxist  thought  it  is  labour  that  creates  value,  i.e.  it  is  the  labour power that is embodied in a good or service that gives it social value. The labour  theory  of  value  is  the  linch-pin  holding  together  work,  production and  output.  Use-values  are  produced  by  conscious  or  purposeful  human activity: such activity may be defined as work. The notion of work not only connotes physical or mental activity but also social relationships which are formed  in  the  process  of  working.  Work  has  two  social  aspects.  First,  it fulfils  a  social  need on the part of the worker-it uses mankind's creative power. Expending such effort is man's 'life-activity'.  What distinguishes the 2 human race from other species is the ability to transform nature to a world of its own making. The second aspect of such activity is that the goods and services  produced  are  consumed.  Material  and  spiritual  human  needs  are met  through  the  consumption  of  goods  and  services.  Production  and consumption  are  both  aspects  of  the  fulfilment  of  needs  in  the  Marxist conception of human beings.

In Marxist theory, the kind of activity or work that characterizes a society (and  the  requisite  structure  of  needs)  is  dependent  on  a  given  mode  of production. The labour process in pre-capitalist societies was linked to the

direct satisfaction of needs; the typical peasant laboured to fulfil his or her material and spiritual wants, and to pay taxes. Employment and unemployment are concepts which only have meaning in a society which has a market for labour. In peasant societies the division of labour activity into  employment  and  unemployment  does  not  occur.  There  is  no  wage labour. There is no sharp demarcation between work and leisure. The social relations engendered by work fo cus on fa mily activity. If the harvest fails, the peasant starves, but he or she is not unemployed. If the family increases in size, all take part in tilling the soil, reaping the harvest and consuming the  produce:  all  are  absorbed  in  the  social  relationships  of  the  domestic economy. If there are too many mouths to fe ed, some go hungry, but they are  not  unemployed. The growth of the division of labour, of paid labour and the employment of workers, gives rise to a dif fe rent constellation of needs: production and consumption are dif fe rentiated. In the expansion of labour  activity  through  a  market  system  men  and  women  need  jobs  or employment, they become wage labour.

While human activity and work fulfil human needs, the Marxist notion of class  structure  modifies  the  ways  that  work  is  organized  and  labour  is performed.  Work  as  fulfilment  of  human  needs,  it  is  argued  by  many Marxists, is vitia ted, even precluded by the capitalist class structure. The division of societies into classes gives rise to a dominant and an exploited class. The significa nce of this division is that the dominant class, as such, does  not  participate  in  labour  activity,  though  the  dominant  class  and  its agents shape the social relatio nships in which work takes place. While the consumption needs of members of the dominant class are met, they do not make any contribution to fulfill ing human needs. Class relations also have their impact on the activity and labour of the exploited class. Exploitation means that the workers' exchange with nature is not an expression of their will  but  is  determined  by  the  domination  of  the  ruling  class.  The  social relations  in  which  paid  work  takes  place  are  based  on  exploitation  and involve conflict. Under capitalism, much (not all) work is instrumental, it is organized by the capitalist class for the realization of exchange-values and for the extraction of surplus though in the process use-value is produced. 3 Under such conditions the fulfilment of the workers' needs, it is argued, is made impossible. The worker becomes alienated.

## Alienation or Fulfilment in Employment?

In the late 1960s and 1970s in western countries, alienation was the primary focus  of  concern  of  Marxist  s.  Alienation  is  one  of  the  most  ambiguous words  used  in  the  social  sciences.  One  may  distinguish  between  three meanings of  the  term.  First,  alienation  is  used  in  a  very  general  sense  to describe  a  lack  of  correspondence  between  people  (as  individuals  or groups)  and  society;  it  depicts  a  state  of  malaise  in  social  relationships involving feelings of isolation, powerlessness, self-estrangement and normlessness.  Secondly,  Marxist  writers  particularly  have  focused  on control of the product of labour. As ownership of the means of production is vested with the capitalist class, the worker's product is alien to him and, in a societal  perspective,  there  arises  a  disjunction  between  production  (for profit) and  human  needs.  This  approach  sees  the  primary  source  of alienation  (both  at  work  and  in  society)  to  lie  in  ownership  relationships. Thirdly, many writers (Marxist and non-Marxist) have found the essence of alienation  to  lie  in  the  modem  process  of  production;  for  this  school,  the nature of and context in which work is performed are alienative.

The  thrust  of  most  recent  western  scholarship  has  been  on  the  third approach  and  has  been  inspired  by  Marx's Economic  and  Philosophical Manuscripts. Such writers have emphasized the fact that large-scale massproduction  process  manufacture  leads  to  the  fragmentation  of  production and  to  the  extreme  division  of  labour.  The  repetitiveness  of  jobs  in  mass production,  the deskilling of manual  and  non-manual  work,  and  the increasing  domination  of  management  over  workers  have  led  Marxists  to deny that such employment fulfils human needs. Such critics are agreed that rather than developing a person's potential powers, 'capitalist labor consumes these powers without replenishing them, bums them up as if they were  a  fuel,  and  leaves  the  individual  worker  that  much  poorer.  The qualities that mark him as a human being become progressively diminished.'  Writers such as Braverman 5 4 emphasize the deskilling process involved  with  the  advance  of  capitalism. An  individual  becomes  'a  living appendage of the machine'. 6

It would be mistaken, however, to regard work, even under capitalism, as alien to people's needs. Needs are relative to the development of society and are socially defined. Under conditions of modern capitalism, wage labour is

a means to meet the necessities of life: it is an instrumentality to fulfil the prime needs of reproduction (food, shelter). It is also valued in itself. To be gainfully  occupied  or  employed  is  a  mark  of  social  recognition  of  one's contribution to society. The dominant class legitimates itself by claiming to contribute to wealth-creation-profit is a reward for risk-taking, and even Royalty  performs  the  ceremonial  aspect  of  government  and  is  claimed  to contribute to the 'tensionmanagement function' of society. For Marxists, a distinction here is between the parasitical class which lives off labour and the productive class which creates value.

This line of reasoning, which posits employment as a major dynamic of modern society, has been questioned in recent years. Writers such as Claus Offe 7 have argued that in advanced western societies, work and employment no longer have such an important role. Following sociologi sts such as Dahrendorf and Bell, Offe argues that labour and wage dependency no  longer  play  a  major  role  as  the  focus  of  collective  concern. 8 In  their stead, as organizing principles, Offe suggests concepts such as 'way of life', post-industrial society, and the home.  Socialist writers, such as Gorz and 9 Willis, have also opposed the oppressive ideology of work under capitalism and called for the positive use of free time. 10

In the 1980s, the advent of high levels of unemployment in the West has led  to  a  different  emphasis  on  work  and  employment.  The  stress  on  the 'alienative' character of work current in the 1960s has been put to one side and  replaced  by  a  concern  for  the  'right  to  work'.  There  has  developed  a recognition of the severe deprivation which ensues if work is denied to a person  and  has  eclipsed  the  writings  of  Bell  and  Offe  and  led  to  a reappraisal  of  employment.  Contemporary  writers  analyse  work  in  four dimensions: for the individual-the provision of income, the 'social recognition'  of  the  worth  of  the  employed  person  and  his  or  her  social status: an activity to occupy and structure the day; an environment in which social conviviality outside the family may be enjoyed; finally, work results in the provision of goods and services which other people may enjoy. 11 The moral and social values engendered  by  capitalism make  work-and especially an occupation and employment-a human need. Unemployment is  not only a potential cost to the economy in that labour is underutilized, but it is a cost to the unemployed individual and to society. Employment is the  main  means  by  which  national  income  is  distributed.  The  burden  of

unemployment is socially differentiated, the poorest groups with no or little capital bear the brunt of the costs and politically it may be socially divisive and destabilizing.

What is true about the critique of Dahrendorf, Bell and Offe is that, as incomes  and  consumption  pass  certain  thresholds,  the  marginal  utility  of money falls. The  'motivation'  effect  of  additional  money  has  declined  for social  groups  who  have  sought  satisfaction  outside  the  work  role.  Just where  these  consumption  thresholds  are  located  is  a  controversial  matter and it seems likely that middle-class strata (earning, say,more than double the average wage) will have lower motivation for extra income than lower income  groups.  Financial  incentives  also  vary  between  societies,  being greater in market-type societies such as the USA and lower in welfare states such  as  pre-Thatcherite  Britain.  The  system  of  pecuniary  rewards  is dominant in the contemporary United States, here retirement in old age may be considered as the postponed gratification of the earned efforts of labour. In  welfare  states,  such  as  the  USSR,  security  in  old  age  and  automatic pensions give rise to a need for greater satisfaction in work. However, the psychological effect of a decrease in income, as with unemployment, gives rise  to  dissatisfaction  for  all  social  groups  in  all  societies. 12 In  a  nutshell, rises in money income do not make all people more satisfied but reductions in money income invariably lead to increases in frustration and dissatisfaction.

Marxists in socialist states have always adopted a positive attitude towards the need for people to work. With regard to labour, the ideology of Soviet Marxism may be called the 'Protestant ethic of socialism'. 13 Lenin's analysis of  work  recognizes  its  primacy  for  the  building  of  socialist  society.  For Lenin,  work  was  not  only  the  fulfilment  of  man's  'species  being'  but  was bound  up  with  the  development  of  productive  forces.  Capitalism  (and  its form  of  labour)  was  progressive  compared  with  fe  udal  society.  Lenin stressed the economic and social advance of wage labour over serfdom. As he put it in The Development of Capitalism in Russia, 'Compared with the

labour of the dependent or bonded peasant, the labour of the hired worker is a progressive phenomenon in all the branches of the economy.' 14

Unlike  advanced  capitalist  countries,  where  wage  labour  was  taken  for granted, the Soviet state set about creating conditions for the growth of a class  of  wage-labourers.  In The  Immediate  Tasks  of  Soviet  Power, Lenin considered  that  a  major  task  of  the  Soviet  government  was  'to  teach  the people how to work'. 15 Large-scale  factory  production,  then  characteristic of capitalism, was regarded as being capable of fulfill ing a higher level of human  needs  than  artisan  labour.  The  most  advanced  forms  of  labour organization  had  to  be  copied  from  the  West.  For  Lenin,  Taylorism  (or scientific  management)  was  'the  last  word  of  capitalism'  and  'its  greatest scientific  achievements  [lie]  in  the  field  of  analysing  mechanical  motions during work, in the elimination of superfluous and awkward motions, in the working out of correct methods of work, and in the introduction of the best system  of  accounting  and  control,  etc'. 16 Taylorism  has  affinities  with Leninism in that it subscribes to 'scientific principles' and hierarchical forms of  organization  and  control.  They  share  common  values  in  seeking  to improve  efficiency  through  the  rational  organization  of  the  work  process and  increasing  the  tempo  of  work.  Taylorism  has  been  adapted  to  the process of work in the USSR with important amendments.

In creating the conditions of a socialist attitude towards work, the Soviet political leadership  was  confronted  not  by  workers  who  had  become alienated  by  capitalist  conditions  of  labour  but  by  peasants  used  to  the rhythm  of  traditional agricult ural production  and  untouched  by  the protestant reformation. The cultural background to the Soviet industrialization process is a condition ing factor of immense importance. The  'Protestant  ethic',  contingent  on  the  rise  of  capitalism  in  Western Europe,  did  not  provide  an  analogous  value-system  on  which  the  Soviet leaders  could  build.  Hence  Stalinism  as  an  ideology  had  elements  of  the provision of a motivating work ethic. In the early period of Soviet power the Soviet leadership encouraged full employment primarily to bring about economic advance-to create the material basis of communism. Also a new type of labour process under socialism was thought to be possible. Work as salvation  is  a  common  element  in  the  Puritan's  and  Stalin's  world-view. 'Alienation' played little part in Soviet Marxist philosophy during the period before  the  death  of  Stalin.  The  major  disjunction  between  producers  and

society was analysed in terms of the second approach to alienation defined above (p. 9)-the separation of the product of labour from its maker.

During the 1950s even the discussi on of the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts did not lead to alienation being considered to lie in the  work  process. 17 The  political  conditions  present  in  the  USSR necessary for the abolition of alienation as a structural condition were held to  be  the  public  ownership of the means of production, the demise of the capital  ist  class,  and  the  replacement  of  production  for  the  market  by planning (i.e. the creation of use instead of exchange values).

Under these conditions labour power ( rabochaya sila ) is not a commodity which is bought and sold under conditions of the competition of capitals. There is, however, a quasi-market for labour. Ownership is vested in the  state  which,  representing  the  interests  of  society,  manages  the employment  of  labour  through  the  planning  organs.  As  a  contemporary Soviet writer, Sorokina, has expressed it, in the USSR labour power has a dual  character:  it  is  the  property  of  society,  as  the  state  is  the  major employer, and it is the property of the worker, who is paid wages for his work. 18 'Material incentives' are given to compensate workers for effort and quality of labour.  The  market,  however,  is  restricted;  wages  are  not responsive to the direct interaction of supply and demand, and combinations of  workers are not allowed to bargain for sectional interests. Differentials (at  least  until  the  advent  of  Gorbachev)  are  relatively  modest.  Social regulation  through  state  planning  of  wage-scales  coexists  with  individual negotiations between worker and management.

The emphasis on the duty to labour which has been made explicit in The Fundamental  Laws  or  Constitutions  of  the  Russian  Republic  and  of  the USSR should be interpreted with this in mind. In distinction from capitalist state s, the Constitutions have always defined work as a right and duty of citizens: the state therefore has an obligation to provide employment. In the twentieth century, western capitalist governments put their policy emphasis on  consumption  rather  than  work.  Unemployment  is  mitigated  by  the provision of a minimum standard of living through unemployment or social welfare benefit. Full employment in socialist states is a vindication of the Marxist  notion  that  labour  is  the  source  of  value  and  that  idleness  is degenerate.  It  is  also  recognition  that  industrial  development  requires  a different work ethic from the traditional peasant one.

The  Bolsheviks  in  1918  were  conscious  that  they  should  define  the essence of the socialist system. As Sverdlov put it: 'Just as in the days of the French  bourgeois  revolution  .  .  .  there  was  proclaimed  a  Declaration  of Rights  of  Man  and  of  the  Citizen.  .  .  so  today  our  Russian  Socialist Revolution  should  likewise  make  its  declaration.  .  .' 19 The  Declaration abolished private  ownership of the means of production, ratified workers' control and, what is of our primary concern, 'in order to do away with the parasitic  classes  of  society  and  [to]  organize  the  economic  life  of  the country,  universal  labour  duty  is  introduced'.  The  first  Constitution  ofthe RSFSR, publish ed on 3 July 1918, reiterated the obligation of all citizens to work, and proclaimed the freedom of citizens from economic exploit ation. Constitution al rights were restricted to those who laboured, symbolically indicating the importance of labour in the new Republic. In the early years of  the  Revolution,  labour  (like  military  service)  was  an  obligation-a povinnost ' as it was described in the 1918 Constit ution. Similar sentiments have  been  expressed  in  the  1936  and  1977  Constitutions.  In  1936  it  was declared  that:  'Work  in  the  USSR  is  a  duty,  a  matter  of  honour  for  every able-bodied citizen-He who does not work shall not eat'. Citizens had the right  to  work  and  to  'guaranteed  employment'.  However,  work  was  now regarded  as  a  duty  ( obyazannost ') and  was  defined  as  such  in  these constitutions. 20

In the development of the USSR up to around 1956, work was regarded as an essential component of building socialism. The emphasis was not on the  content  or  form  of  labour  so  much  as  the  socio-political  necessity  of work.  Hence  Marxism  -  Leninism,  as  it  developed  under  Stalin  in  the USSR,  became  an  ideology  which  was  used  to  develop  work  attitudes necessary  for  industrial  growth.  These  attitudes  were  transmitted  to  the peasantry, and to the newly arrived townspeople. Such ideological precepts were accompanied by many massive campaigns glorifying the factory and its work in general which sought to create a positive attitude to labour in an urban setting.

Changing Conceptions of Work

The  declarations  of  the  1936  and  1977  Constitutions  of  the  USSR  have witnessed  a  change  in  emphasis  concerning  the  role  of  work.  The  earlier constitutional claims (and policy which derived from them) emphasized the social necessity of work in order to provide the necessities of life; work was a duty to create the conditions of the first stage of the communist mode of production. Work was seen as a human necessity and was counterposed to the idleness of a parasitical ruling class. In the 1977 Constitution (Article 60), the citizen is given a right to socially useful activity chosen by him or her; in practice, the choice of a trade or profession. This recognition signals a  development in the Soviet conception of work under 'mature socialism'. Individual satisfaction in, and with, work is now of greater importance to policy-makers. As  the  late  Leonid  Brezhnev  put  it:  'Socialism  as  a  social structure has within it great possibilities for the rational and human use of society's  main  productive  force-human  labour.' 21 Under  socialism  work should become 'a need and a pleasure'. 22 It  is  assumed that people should have  work  in  keeping  with  their  capabilities,  education  and  professional training.  In  general,  people  are  not  directed  to  work  in  any  particular geographical  area,  or  in  any  branch  or  enterprise  of  the  economy,  and people cannot be sacked without the agreement of the local trade union or without following the due process of law. 23

In  1984,  Chernenko  reiterat  ed:  'the  principle  of  socialism,  which  is sacred to us, is from each according to his ability, to each according to his work. This is the foundation of the social justice that our working class and our people, for the first  time  in  history,  have  converted  from  dreams  into living reality.' 24 In his speech to the Party Congress on 25 February 1986, Gorbachev also emphasized the fact that the essence of social justice of the Soviet system is 'from each according to his abilities, to each according to his work'. 25 The notion that people have a right and a duty to work is one of the  most  firmly  bedded,  'taken  for  granted'  assumptions  made  by  citizens and policy-makers in the USSR.  Aganbegyan  echoes  many  people's sentiments when he says, 'I have always considered that the chief joy of life and the one that gives it meaning is work'. 26 In  distinction from capitalist society, Kosalapov (then editor of Kommunist ) described socialist society as a  'working  society'  not  a  'consumer  society'  and  S.  Ivanov,  writing  in Pravda in March 1983, makes explicit that one of 'the fundamental duties of the  government  is  to  provide  work  for  every  citizen'. 27 The  economic

system, argues Ivanov, operates in such a way as to provide work-and a choice  of  work.  The  universality  ( vseobshchnost' )  of  labour  distinguishes socialism  from  capitalism.  These  views  are  given  wide  publicity  in  the Soviet Union. For instance, a broadcast on Moscow Radio on 28 January 1985 contrasted 'USSR Employment with USA Unemployment'. Reporting on the USSR Central Statistical Agency's report of economic achievements for  1984  which  stated  that  'complete  employment  of  the  workforce  was ensured in the country . . . [and] has become a way of life', it was concluded that: 'Complete employment under socialism and growing unemployment in capitalist countries are characteristic features of different social systems . . .' 28

I he Soviet ideology or labour provides greater constraints on the political leadership than is found under capitalism: not only is there an expectation that paid work will be provided for all but that such work is required to be 'satisfying'. Economic reformers and planners make explicit the goal of the provision  of  employment:  'In  the  system  of  socialist  production  relations, guaranteeing ablebodied people jobs is one of the most important independent tasks of the planned development of social production . . .' 29 E.R.  Sarukhanov,  in  an  authoritative  review  of  labour  under  socialism, points  out  that  'socialism  creates  the  possibility  for  the  full  use  of  the workforce because the development of social production is made subordinate  to  the  task  of  satisfying  the  growing  material  and  cultural demands  of  the  members  of  society.  .  .  .  Socialist  reproduction  is  an unlimited process, because in socialist society there is no limit to the growth of  requirement  for  people.  .  .  .  Labour  is  a  need-a  means  of  man's development, of realising his capabilities . . .' 30 As Gorbachev emphasized in his speech commemorating the 150th anniversary of Lenin's birth:

For the first time in history, the working man has become the master of his country, the maker of his own destiny. The guaranteed right to work and its remuneration, society's care for man from his birth to old age, the wide access to culture, the respect for the individual's dignity and rights, the steady expansion of the working people's participation in management-all these are eternal values and inseparable features of the socialist way of life. Herein lies the most important source of political stability, social optimism and confidence in the future. 31

To abrogate the right to, and provisions of, employment would seriously undermine the ideology and legitimacy of the ruling groups in the USSR. In his  speech  to  the  27th  Party  Congress,  Ligachev  stressed  that:  'Socialism

cannot allow and will not allow large groups of working people-and the count may well be in millions-to find themselves redundant in society as a result of scientific and technical progress, not prepared for work in the new conditions . . .' 32

There are three functions to having an occupation ( zanyatost' ): (i) economic (promoting economic growth): (ii) income (participation in and creation of national  income);  and  (iii)  social  (the  realization  of  social  needs  through labour). 33 In framing social policy, the social, psychological and physiological  aspects  of  employment  are  given  greater  emphasis  than  in capitalist societies. 34

## Problems of Motivation for Work

Offe and other critics of the work process under contemporary capitalism have pointed to the developing crisis of 'exchange-rationality' when market conditions do not act as 'effective and reliable' spurs to individual action. 35 A socialist society, however, anticipates this condition by stressing more the collective necessity (rather than merely the individual instrumentality) for work activity. The Soviet dictum of 'giving according to one's ability and receiving according to one's work' poses the contradiction between individuals'  expressive  needs  for  work  and  the  instrumental  returns  from work. Needs cannot be met solely through an increase in pay. Zaslavskaya has  pointed  out  that  wage  incentives  are  proving  to  be  less  effective: 'managers  claim  in  recent  years.  .  .  that  many  workers  have  no  serious interest in extra money.' 36 The increased material well-being of the country reduces  the  economic  need  to  work  intensively.  She  argues  that  workers' effort is not recompensed properly. The need to calculate proper norms and incentive payment has been taken up by the Gorbachev leadership. 37

The  other  side  of  the  contradiction,  however,  has  to  do  with  the development of individuals'  interest  in  work-their  possibilities  of  giving according to their abilities. Zaslavskaya points out that greater independence and initiative is necessary for working people to express their creativity. 38 The  conditions.  of  labour,  access  to  education  and  social

services, the allocation to work 'according to people's abilities' (rather than by  privileged  position),  the  creation  of  a  management  structure  enabling workers to work efficiently, are also important considerations in a socialist system. 39 The provision of services to the non-working population (children, pensioners, and other groups such as the disabled) also has to be ensured to fulfil socialist criteria of social justice. If Habermas and Offe are correct  in  pointing  to  the  limitations  of  'market  incentives'  (including  the reserve army of unemployed) as a motivating force for work, then orthodox Soviet  economists  and  sociologists  have  a  case  in  seeking  to  improve motivation for work outside the market nexus. A current danger in Soviet policy is to copy western market-type forms of incentives to the extent of undermining a socialist pattern of organization.

The  low-pay/full-employment economy  characteristic of the USSR creates  its  own  problems.  It  is  often  argued  that  the  desire  for  'satisfying' work, the absence of a 'reserve army' of unemployed and ineffective wage incentives lead to a poorly motivated workforce and this in turn undermines another tenet in the Soviet concept of building socialism-the steady rise in material welfare. While such fa ctors undoubtedly make increases in labour productivity difficult to obtain, one should not put all the fault on the policy of full employment:  countries  experiencing  unemployment  also  have difficulties  in  raising  labour  productivity  and,  as  noted  above,  in  securing motivation for work. Even more fundamentally, the market as an institution has  been  faulted  by  some  western  commentators  as  a  means  to  satisfy human wants. 40  (See discussion below, p.218.) There is a tension in Soviet society  between  the  economic  requirements  of  the  economy  and  the aspirations  of  many  people.  The  provision  of  paid  employment  is  a traditional social goal (both for the individual and the society of which he or she is part) and has to be reconciled with the aspirations for different types of work  expressed  by  individuals.  Soviet  policy-makers  therefore  are constrained by policy objectives which have not been adopted by governments under capitalism: (a) the provision of employment for all the population, and (b) the requirement to give opportunities to people to find satisfaction in such work.

Other contradictions occur over the 'rational' use of labour ( ratsional'naya zanyatost ')  and people's individual preferences. The Soviet labour specialist, Kostakov, has pointed out that the needs of the population may not coincide with the needs of production; the necessity of activity in

the workplace is not the same as human need under communism. In order to reconcile individual interests with production ones, differentials in respect of  wages,  pensions  and  holidays  are  established.  Another  example  of  a contradiction is the need of women to participate in employment to enhance their personal development and society's need for women to replenish the population stock. 41 (Working  women  have  fewer  children  and  some commentators,  recognizing  'women's  labour  in  housework'  and  in  childraising, have advocated a reduction in the level of women's employment.) 42 Conflicts  of  social  and  individual  interests  also  occur  over  redundancies; this topic will be taken up later.

Under  the  conditions  of  socialist  states  we  must  distinguish  between different  types  of  alienation  and  disenchantment  with  work.  Prior  to  the 1960s Soviet writers were mainly concerned with the structurally-induced types of disjunction under capitalism between the labourer and his product involving the production of exchange rather than use-values. In more recent times  attention  has  focused  on  a  type  of  dissatisfaction  occurring  when individual workers are unhappy with the conditions of their labour and with the jobs that they are required to do under conditions of modern technology. In this latter sense, 'alienation' has been developed by western writers such as Seeman and Blauner 43  (the third sense defined above, p. 9). Such writers shift the emphasis away from structural factors associated with a mode of production,  to  the  individual's  perceptions  of  his  or  her  labour  which  are shaped  by  the  technology  of  modem  production.  'In  modem  industrial employment, control, purpose, social integration and self involvement are all problematic.' 44

Many  Soviet  studies  have  pointed  to  the  rise  of  such  attitudes  in  the labour process in the USSR. 45 The expansion of consumerism in the USSR has  led  to  a  greater'instrumentality'  in  the  attitudes  of  workers  towards work, and the rising levels of education have led to a growth in desire for interest  and  self-satisfaction  in  work. 46 The  greater  use  of  the  market,  of material incentives and  of a consumerist  mentality  has  led  to  more 'instrument  alism' in the attitudes of workers  towards  work.  Despite condemnation  of  'consumerism',  the  Leningrad  study  of  young  workers found  that  'some  young  people  are  undergoing  a  so-called  instrumen talization of their attitude towards work, that is, the basic values of labour

are shifting from the sphere of its content to the area of working conditions and remuneration.' 47

Soviet  sociologists  and  other  commentators  have  advocated  greater participation in management in the enterprise and various schemes of teamwork assembly to overcome monotonous work. 48 Lenin's ideas of Taylorism  and  the  importation  of  western  methods  of  the  work  process (particularly  mass-production  assembly)  have  been  somewhat  updated  by the advocacy of the more humane face of contemporary western procedures and the modernization, as it were, of brigade and team methods, and various other  types  of  'socialist  emulation'.  These  are  not  only,  as  invariably interpreted  in  the  West,  ways  to  increase  labour  productivity  but  are intended  to  develop  a  moral  tone  appropriate  to  a  socialist  form  of  work behaviour. Indeed, some Soviet sociologists (particularly Yadov and Zdravomyslov)  have  been  at  pains  to  argue  that  increasing  'satisfaction' with  work  will  not  necessarily  increase  labour  productivity.  Similarly, recent Soviet discussions on the election of managers and an enhanced role to  the  labour  collective  are  also  indications  of  ways  in  which  a  more 'socialistic' labour  process  may  be  created. 49 The  imbalance  between people's aspirations for jobs with the array of posts available is a problem which is to be resolved through the 'lowering of ambition' and a diffe rent fo rm of school socialization-particularly the provision of vocational education.

In  considering  these  disjunctions  between  aspirations  for  work  and  the kinds  of  jobs  available,  one  must  bear  in  mind  that  (unlike  under  capit alism) the dominant ideology requires not only that work for all has to be provided  but  that  this  work  should  give  satisfaction  to  the  worker.  The relatively high proportion of real income derived from 'social consumption' (highly subsidiz ed housing, travel, health, education, leisure) makes the use of  material  incentives  less  potent  as  an  incentive  to  labour  than  under capitalism.  There  are  therefore  structurally-induced  expectations  which make the fit between aspiration and reality more difficult to achieve than in the  West.  Getting  the  'right  attitude'  towards  work  is  not  just  a  way  of increasing  labour  productivity  but  has  'a  direct  relationship  to  the  moral state of the entire people, the entire society'. 50

A major difference between socialist states and capitalist ones is that in the  former  there  is  less  differentiation  between  'the  individual  realm  of

work' 51 and the collectivized provision of welfare. The Soviet factory is the hub of the distribution of welfare benefits; leisure provision, recreation and housing  are  closely  linked  to  the  enterprise  through  the  trade  union  and ancillary organisations. 52 This gives the workplace a greater role in the life of  the  individual  than  it  does  in  the  West.  The  high  effective  labour participation rate also precludes the development of countercultures, as in the West, where non-work and unemployment  may  be  normal  and legitimate.  Measures  initiated  by Andropov  and  continued  by  Gorbachev against 'parasitism' (see below p.55) have to be seen against the backcloth of a value system emphasizing the social utility of labour.

## 2 A Full-Employment Economy?

## The Evolution of Full

## Employment

In the period following the Revolution, the Soviet leadership was not only influenced by considerations

concerning the building of 'communist man', but also by more pressing and immediate economic and

political  demands.  In  the  early  years  of  Soviet  power,  providing  work  (or reducing levels of unemployment) was

not a priority. 1 It was not until 1930 or 1931

that  one  may  say  that  mass  unemployment  came  to  an  end  in  the  USSR. 2 During  the  period  of  War  Communism  and  the  New  Economic  Policy, unemployment

continued at levels comparable to those of Western European countries. The chief cause of unemployment was the

movement of peasants to the town to seek work. 3 The draft of the first Five Year Plan, compiled in 1927, estimated that the

unemployment level of 1.9 million of that year would rise to over 2.3 million in 1931-32.  The advent of the Five Year Plans, however, with their 4

vast expansion programmes, led to an increase in employment opportunities not only in industry and building but

also in the sphere of government services (e.g. health, education).

The Marxist ideology of work coincided with economic rationality. Soviet industrialization strategy was to

maximize labour inputs, which were abundant and cheap whereas capital was scarce and expensive. Despite the

growth of population of working age and the massive influx of peasants to the towns (1.6 million in 1928 and 2.63

million in 1930) the number of jobs increased to such an extent that mass unemployment was eliminated. The growth

of  the  population  of  working  age  and  the  growth  in  the  number  of employed  for  the  periods  1920-26,  1926  -29,  1939-1959,  1959-1970,  and 1970-1979  are  shown  in  Figure  2.1.  In  the  1930s,  a  seven-hour  day  was introduced, labour was used

'around the clock' and the low-pay economy  was  instrumental in encouraging managers to maximize the

recruitment  of  labour.  Educational  facilities  and  health  services  were expanded and these not only absorbed the

unemployed but provided opportunities  for  the  graduates  of  educational institutions. A massive increase in

non-manual posts occurred providing work and opportunity for a middle class.

The ending of mass unemployment, with its attendant low-pay

economy, must be considered in the context of a developing society. The 'employed' population as a

proportion of the able-bodied labour force was relatively low in the 1930s. A large share of the workforce was

engaged in agriculture, either on individual plots or on collective farms, and there were administrative

restrictions on their geographical and occupational mobility. Such groups of the population could not be

considered to be 'employed' wage labour, and as such they were not part of the labour market. There was,

as in many agricultural societies,'under employment' in the countryside in the sense that the

peasants'  time  was  either  not  usefully  occupied  with  work  or  their marginal productivity was very low or even

## negative.

With  the  ending  of  mass  unemployment,  labour  exchanges  were  closed and the matching of vacancies with labour

demand took place mainly through a quasi-labour market. (The exchanges were reopened in 1967, see below

pp.50-54).  In  the  towns,  workers  were  able  to  leave  their  jobs  to  work elsewhere: they were recruited by

presenting  themselves  'at  the  factory  gate'.  The  government  ended  the payment of unemployment benefit

from October 1930 and this encouraged mobility between jobs and areas and acted as a means to cajole the

unemployed  to  work.  The  ending  of  mass  unemployment  helped  to legitimate the Soviet government. It was, and still

is, proclaimed as a success of Soviet power and considered to further the development of communist man. Since

that time, it has become a 'sacred' element in Soviet policy.

It  is  mistaken  to  believe  that  ideology  plays  a  constant  role  in  political affairs. Ideology acts as a constraint

on political  leaders  but  it  is  within  limits  also  capable  of  being  adapted and  suited  to i their  political  purposes.  Marxism  as  an  ideology  of  labour legitimated a regime under Lenin and

Stalin in which all had a duty ( povinnost' ) to labour. The economic needs of

Soviet Russia required not only a massive transfer of labour from village to town, but an ideology of work:

Soviet Marxism provided it. The provision of full employment in contrast to the unemployment of capitalism became

one  of  the  Soviet  Union's  success  stories.  The  leadership's  claim  to  be building a 'socialist

state' rested on the provision of employment for all. This in turn is a major constraint on economic policy.

How far then is it true to say that the contemporary USSR provides full employment for the whole population?

## The

## Employed Labour Force 1939 to 1982

Before  considering  the  actual  rates  of  labour  utilization  and  the  extent  to which different types of unemployment

or underemployment continue, the definition of a number of relevant terms is necessary.

The employed labour force is usually understood to include persons above a specified

age who are at work for pay (and in capitalist countries for profit) during a given period. This includes those

who have a job but are temporarily absent for reasons of illness, injury, leave or industrial dispute. The

self-employed are usually defined as 'employed' in the sense of being part of the economically active

labour force, though from a social and occupational point of view (which does not concern us here) these two

occupational  statuses  should  not  be  confused.  The economically  active population includes  members  of  the  armed  fo  rces,  but  excludes  unpaid domestic workers and full-time students. 5

The  term unemployment 6 is  defined  to  include  those  people  within  a specified age range who are

available for employment  but  whose  work  has  been  suspended  or terminated, including those who have not had a job

and are seeking employment. The essence of 'involuntary unemployment' is that the person must be of

employable age, actively seeking work and unable to find. it. There is also a minimum period of unsuccessful job

search  (usually  three  months,  but  often  longer)  which  is  necessary  to qualify for the status of being

'unemployed'  as  far  as  the  compilation  of  labour  statistics  in  market economies is concerned. In the

Soviet economy, unemployment statistics in this sense are not comprehensively collected.

Another distinction may be made in terms of underemployment. This has to do with the

inadequacy  of  a  person's  employment,  involving  working  involuntarily part of the time ('visible

underemployment')  or  a  'misallocation  of  labour  resources' such  as underutilization of skill or low

productivity ('invisible under-employment').  It is important to distinguish 7 between underemployment (or overemployment) and

unemployment as these situations are often confused and conflated. The under employed

person (a) receives an income, (b) has an occupational status, and (c) has an activity to structure the day.

What is lacking, however, is (d) an effective contribution to production. The financial

burden of the underemployed is borne by the employer and consumer. The social cost of being unemployed is borne

largely by the unemployed person and welfare support as provided by the government (or in the West by charities).

What is an inefficient labour policy for a firm or industry may not be so for society as a whole: taking account

of  social  costs  and  political  costs,  it  might  be  more  beneficial  to  keep labour at work but underemployed than to

have mass unemployment.

All  studies  of  the  Soviet  labour  force  point  to  the  fact  that  a  very  high proportion of the population is

economically  active.  However,  in  comparative  perspective,  the  legally sanctioned age of entry to paid labour is

relatively high as a compulsory ten-year education (in some areas, eleven) gives a minimum age threshold of 17

years  and about 24 per cent of the population 8

continues in full-time tertiary education to the age of 21 (or more).  The 9 age of retirement is low-60 years for men and 55 years for women; and

employees in certain industries (e.g. coalmining) are entitled to retire even earlier. Details about the exact

proportion of the population in work, and the kind of work performed by people of various ages, have not been

published by the Soviet government for the recent past. On the basis of the data available, however, one may make

- a number of estimates about the levels of employment.

Statistics  on  the  labour  force  are  published  by  the  Central  Statistical Administration in the

annual  statistical  yearbook  ( Narodnoe  khozyaystvo  SSSR , )   these  specify the  number  of  persons  employed  in  various  industries  and  agricultural employment in terms of state

farms ( sovkhozy ) and collective farms ( kolkhozy ). The

censuses of the population (1959, 1970, 1979) define employment status (including pensioners in full-time work)

and  that  of  1979  includes  men  and  women  occupied  (as  their  main occupation) in private agricultural production.

These  official  statistics  have  some  deficiencies:  the  military  and  prison population are either ignored or

included  in  other  (non-specified)  sources,  part-time  workers  (such  as children, students) and those working in

the 'second economy' are excluded. People having more than one job may be counted twice in employment

returns. Such  deficiencies,  of  course,  also  apply  to  other  countries' statistics. Table 2.1 shows employment levels on the basis of the census by age

groups.  These  data  show  in  summary  form  overall  the  high  and  rising participation rates. These figures, however,

need to be further refined.

Table 2.2 shows data on various aspects of

labour  participation  for  various  years  from  1939  to  1982:  the  total population, that of 'working age',

the  full-time  student  population  (over  17  years  of  age),  the  numbers  of employed manual and non-manual workers,

and those engaged in the 'social economy' 10 of collective farms. Study of the table brings out:

- (a)  the  growth,  both  relative  and  absolute  since  1940,  of  the  employed manuals and non-manuals (line 4),
- (b) the decline in the collective farm labour force (excluded here are those solely engaged on private plots)

(line 5),

- (c) the increase of those in employment and study as a proportion of the population working age (line

6).

Compared to other countries, the USSR has a much larger economically active population. If one considers, as a

crude statistic, the total number of economically active people, including collective farmers and those in

private agriculture, divided by the total number  of people in the economically active age groups (17-59 for men,

17-54 for women) one has a percentage in 1979 of 91.28 per cent. For the 16-59 and 16-54 cohorts the total is

Notes:

88.38 per cent. 11 The

Soviet rate for men aged 16-59 in 1979 was 88,46 per cent; the comparable figure (16-54) for women was 88.2 per

cent. Comparative figures for West Germany (in 1980) are 86.3 per cent for men (15-59 year olds) and 54.7 per

cent for women (15-54 year olds), and for France 82.7 and 53.9 per cent. 12 We must bear in mind that the Soviet Union has a higher participation rate in

education and a younger retirement age and also that in market economies a large proportion (usually more than

## half) of employed women are working part-time. The higher participation of women becomes clearer when we consider

age-specific rates.

Unlike the practice in other countries, 13 the

USSR does not release statistics on age cohort levels of employment. The United States

Foreign Demographic Analysis Division has calculated participation rates by age and sex and these are reliable

estimates. 14 Some key figures are shown on

Table 2.3. Here we observe for men in the

20-54  age  bracket  participation  rates  of  over  90  per  cent,  rising  to  a maximum of 97.6 per cent in the 30-39 year

age  bracket.  The  fall-off  at  either  end  is  due  on  the  one  hand  to participation in higher education, and on the

other hand to early retirements (retirement for men normally takes place at 55 and at 50 years for certain

industries). Women also have a high participation rate, though lower than that of men. Of women in the 30-39 year

age cohort, 93 per cent are in employment. The reduction at each end is due once again to full-time study and

retirement.  Differences  in  proportions  in  employment  between  men  and women in the 20-50 age groups only come to

from 3 to 5 per cent: during childbirth and associated leave women are recorded as being employed (in accordance

with the 'temporarily absent' stipulation mentioned above).

The significance of these data is brought out in comparative perspective. In Table 2.4 are reproduced the economic participation rates for France, West

Germany and Hungary for 1981. While for males, the Soviet participation rate is only a few points higher in the

30-50 age groups, the disparity becomes much greater when one studies the female population. The difference

between the Soviet and Western European female labour force participation rates is from 20 to 40 percentage

points greater. Moreover, Soviet women are employed on a full-time basis (some studies show that they are at paid

work only one hour per week less than men), whereas a high proportion (usually more than half) of employed women

in Western Europe are part-timers.

## 'Underoccupied' Social

## Groups

Despite  the  ideological  emphasis  on  work  as  a  human  need  and  the comprehensive provision by the economy of paid

occupations there remain various forms of under- and unemployment in the USSR. The amount of

'involuntary'  unemployment  (in  the  sense  of  people  actively  seeking  work but unable to find any) is low,

and Soviet policy is intent on utilizing to the maximum its labour resources. Since the late 1970s, this task has

falling and the burden of the maintenance of the older population (which is rising) becomes heavier. There are

three main social groups which Soviet analysts regard as being 'underoccupied': these

are  older  school  pupils  and  students,  women  and  old  age  pensioners.  The amount of part-time work is very small:

ignoring participation in the second economy, it has been estimated that as a proportion of all workers,

part-timers came to 0.32 per cent in 1974, 0.41 per cent in 1976 15 and 0.41 per cent in 1979. In 1978, out of a total of some half million

part-time  workers,  women  with  children  constituted  120,000:  in  industry were 28,000, state farms 8,000, building

4,600, other branches 82,000. 16 Education

accounts for many of the residual: in 1974, 1.02 per cent of employees were part-timers. The urbanized Russian

republic (RSFSR) employs more than the other republics: in 1975 about 2 per cent of the workforce there were

part-time.

## Students

Many  school  pupils  in  rural  areas  work  part-time  in  agriculture.  In  some areas of the country, as many as a third

of  all  schoolchildren  work  in  agriculture  for  more  than  six  months  of  the year (see below, p.81). In the early

1980s, school-leavers entering the labour market have a gap of from three to six months 17 between leaving school and starting work. Students in

university education numbered 5.3 million in 1982/83, of whom 60 per cent were full-time; another 4.5 million

were in technical institutes ( tekhnikums ) with roughly the same proportion in

full-time study. 18 Of those in full-time

study, about half do not have a grant 19 and

thus there is an available pool of labour with some spare time and a financial incentive to work. The extent of

student employment is not known precisely. Novitsky and Babkina 20 suggest that about half of all part-time workers are students. They mostly work

in agriculture and construction in the summer months. As for school pupils, it has been reported that about 3

million work on farms for one month in the summer. 21  No records are kept of student 'dropouts'. In the Russian republic

(RSFSR),  it  has  been  estimated  that  180,000  young  people  a  year  leave secondary and higher education early.

Kotlyar calculates that this represents an annual unemployment loss of 15, 000 full-time workers. 22

## Women

We have  noted  earlier  the  very  high  labour  participation  rates  of  women. There are, however, some women who are

not employed, and Soviet policy-makers are attempting to bring them into the workforce. The

1979  census  showed  significant  inter-republic  variations  in  terms  of  the labour participation rate for women. The

USSR average yearly participation rate was 47.8 per cent of the total female population and the average level of

dependency  was  29.7  per  cent  (i.e.  the  proportion  of  non-employed  to employed). In the Russian republic (RSFSR)

the  comparable  figures  were  49.8  per  cent  and  26.0  per  cent.  In  Latvia, however, the participation rate was much

higher at 51.3 per cent and that of dependence lower at 25.1 per cent. At the other end of the scale came

Turkmeniya  (38.4  and  50.2  per  cent),  Armenia  (44.8  and  39.7  per  cent) Tadzhikistan (37 and 51.5 per cent),

Kirgiziya (39.5 and 45.1 per cent), Azerbaydzhan (41.1 and 45.1 per cent), Kazakhstan (43.4 and 40.6 per cent)

and Uzbekistan (38.4 and 48.3 per cent). Only in Tadzhikistan did private agricultural work as a main activity

take up more than one per cent of the female labour activity (1.1 per cent). 23

Whether  these  figures  represent  'underutilization'  or,  as  some  western

writers maintain, an excessive use

of  female  labour,  is  a  complicated  matter  of  interpretation  and  policy choice. On the one hand are arguments

concerning  the  social  and  political  importance  of  the  employment  of women. An absence of paid employment, it is

argued, belittles the social role of women: a lack of jobs per se leads to an

inferior  social  status  and  financial  dependence  on  men.  The  economy needs more workers, especially due to

negative demographic patterns.

On the other hand, is the argument that the present levels of employment exploit women's labour. Not only do

women bear the burden of the upbringing of children and the major share of housework, but they also occupy the

most unskilled jobs, their occupational advancement is restricted and their pay is, on average, 30-35 per cent

lower than men's. The concentration of women in low-paid industries is a vicious circle perpetuating low

pay. 24 In a study of wage differentials in the

cellulose, paper and wood processing industry of the USSR, Blyakhman and Zlotnitskaya found that women gave less

priority  to  pay  than  to  favourable  working  conditions,  the  proximity between workplace and residence, and the

services provided by the enterprise. Men were found to be three times as likely to be oriented towards wages

which compensated for unfavourable working conditions. Even with the same job skills, men have higher

expectations concerning wages. 25 Women find social and psychological

satisfaction in employment: one study found that 70.5 per cent of women with less than seven years' education

sought a job, even if they had no financial need. The figure rose to 93 per cent for women with specialist

secondary education. 26

Economic  demand  has  coincided  with  social  policy,  and  has  led  to  the high female participation rate. Increases in

women's  participation  have  followed  the  expansion  of  industry  (in  the 1930s), the decline in the number of

men available for labour (during and after the Second World War) and the demographic labour shortage (during the

1970s and 1980s). With economic development there has been a tendency for men to move into skilled jobs and for

women  to  be  recruited  from  domestic  or  agricultural  labour  to  fill unskilled  jobs  vacated  by  men, 27 though  the  number  and  proportion  of Soviet women in

skilled  manual  and  professional  jobs  greatly  exceeds  those  in  advanced capitalist countries. M.Ya. Sonin has

calculated that, typically, 31 per cent of male workers will be in the highly skilled manual grades of work

(grades  V-VI)  whereas  only  4  per  cent  of  women  will  be  so,  in  the unskilled categories (I-II), will be found 19

per cent of male workers and 66 per cent of the female. 28

The  policy  options  concerning  women's  employment  are  brought  to  a head over the issue of part-time work.

Excluding the collective farm sector, only 0.41 per cent of the workforce is part-time, half of whom are

women. 29  Two-thirds of all part-time workers

are in the service sector, accounting for one per cent of the employees. 30 Leaving aside regional and ethnic factors, the major reason for the lower

participation of women in the workforce is their responsibility for children and housework. It has been estimated

that  8  to  9  per  cent  of  urban  women  of  employable  age  are  lost  to  the workforce because of their need to care for

young  children  at  home;  several  million  of  these  are  women  under  30 years  of  age. 31 Family  burdens,  together  with  the  need  for  extra  family income, favourably

dispose many women to part-time labour. In 1977, one survey found that of women without an occupation, 40 per

cent expressed a wish to work part-time. Moskoff, in summarizing Soviet research, concludes that 90 per cent of

those who want part-time work are women; 22 per cent of women not at work sought part-time labour and 10 per cent

of those in work preferred part-time jobs. 32

While the provision of part-time work would undoubtedly draw into the labour force women who

are  engaged  at  home  or  in  subsidiary  agriculture,  it  would  also  deploy many women from full-time into part-time

work. As the economic loss from the latter would considerably outweigh the gain from the former, policy makers

are  loath  to  advocate  a  widening  of  opportunities  for  part-timers.  In addition, management is often

psychologically  unprepared  for  the  introduction  of  part-timers  believing that changes will disrupt production

even  though  worker  productivity  may  be  higher.  Policy  advocated  by Gorbachev at the 27th Party Congress in 1986

was  to  increase  the  provision  of  part-time  jobs  and  to  develop  work  at home. As most of the present demand for

part-time work is from women, its introduction would have the effect of creating a secondary labour market, which

would be to the long-term disadvantage of women compared to men. The latter would regard employment as a career

while women part-time workers would conceive of their job instrumentally as an added source of family income

('pin money  ')  and  social  satisfaction.  The  part-time  nature  of  their employment would effectively

exclude women from managerial posts and would be detrimental to their occupational mobility. Part-time work would

exacerbate  the  present  condition  of  inequality  of  women  vis-à-vis  men caused by industrial and occupational

segregation, inequality in educational opportunity, social attitudes defining 'women's work', and the

responsibility  of  women  for  the  maintenance  of  the  family  and  the home. 33

## Pensioners

We have seen that the Soviet Union has very high labour participation rates for the 'economically active'

population,  rather  higher  than  those  of  capitalist  states.  Such  participation excludes people who have retired

either  through  disablement  or  old  age.  The  official  age  of  retirement, introduced in the late 1920s, however, is

much lower than in the West. The retention in the workforce of women over 55 years of age and men over 60 years

is one of the main ways that the reduction in the number of young workers coming into the labour market can be

offset. The total number of people on pensions in the USSR has increased as follows: 4 million in 1941 (0.2

million  being  old  age),  21.9  million  (5.4  million  old  age)  in  1961,  41.3 million  (24.9  million  old  age)  in  1971  and  51,4  million  (35.0  million  old age)  in  1982. 34 The  employment of old age pensioners has risen in recent years. As a proportion

of the total Soviet labour force, old age pensioners were 0.8 per cent in 1960, 2.8 per cent in 1970,4.3 per cent

in 1975 and 6.9 per cent in 1982. 35 Of old age

pensioners  in  1960,  11.7  per  cent  were  in  employment.  By  1970,  the proportion had risen to 19 per cent and by

1982 it was 32 per cent. 36 (The number of

people  of  retirement  age  in full-time work  as  defined  in  the  1979  census, however,

was only 11 per cent.) 37

As  to  disabled  persons,  some  25  to  30  per  cent  are  employed.  The majority of those with grade 3 disabilities

(mildly disabled) have jobs; of those in grade 2 (severely disabled but not requiring constant care), only 5 per

cent are employed; in group 1, a negligible number are employed. Most of such employment is in urban areas where

special workshops have been set up; others work at home. 38 To encourage the recruitment of disabled people, enterprises are allowed to

keep an extra proportion of profits when they employ them. 39 Significantly more disabled people could be employed if conditions were

improved.

Since the early 1970s, Soviet policy has been to encourage pensioners to continue at work. Surveys have found

that many workers reaching pensionable age would prefer to stay on. In the late 1970s, for instance, one study

found that 79.5 per cent of men and 61.3 per cent of women wished to continue at work, and over 80 per cent of

these  desired  to  continue  in  their  old  job  at  the  same  place  of  work. 40 Pensioners may receive their pension in addition to their wage, subject to the

condition  that  they  may  not  have  more  than  a  total  of  300  roubles  per month. (Average earnings in 1982 was 177

roubles per month.) Should the pensioner's combined wage and pension exceed 300 roubles, the wage is reduced

by the difference. One exception to liability to this deduction is pensioners employed in mining, non-ferrous

metals and certain other essential industries: in these industries there is no wage ceiling and of course the

minimum retirement age here is 55 years for men. Since January 1980, pensioners have been able to forgo drawing

their  pension  at  retirement  age  and  to  rely  on  their  wages;  in  these circumstances they are able to qualify for a

pension at an enhanced rate when they do retire and the maximum pension payable rises from 120 roubles per month

to 150 roubles.

41

In terms of labour supply and effective utilization, the financial incentives outlined above

already show a significant increase in labour participation. In the republic of Azerbaydzhan in 1984, it was

reported  that  44  per  cent  of  pensioners  were  in  work  and  of  those qualifying for pensions between 1982 and 1984

more than 70 per cent chose to continue working. 42 It seems likely that the labour participation rate of the under 70 age group

will be approximately 35 per cent in the mid-1980s and will compensate somewhat for the relative decline of new

entrants  to  the  labour  force.  It  will  also  bring  the  USSR  more  into  line with western capitalist states as far as

the age of effective retirement is concerned. Social policy for increasing the level of pensioners' labour

force  participation  derives  from  the  economic  need  to  maintain  present levels of employment and to reduce the

number of dependants on the employed population.

## Some

## Conclusions

While one is hampered by the lack of comprehensive and detailed statistics on levels of employment, the empirical

data  assembled  in  this  chapter  enable  us  to  come  to  a  number  of  reliable conclusions concerning the rates of

labour  utilization.  First,  since  1959,  on  any  comparable  basis,  the  labour force participation rate in the USSR

has been of a very high magnitude. Second, the participation of women has been at a quantitatively higher level

than that of women in industrialized advanced western countries and that of men in the 30-45 age group is

comparable to advanced western countries. Third, due to the incidence of an early retirement age, the period of

full participation ceases at an earlier age than in the West. The retirement age of men (60 years) and women (55

years)  is  much  lower  than  in  Western  European  countries  and  the  60-65 (men) and 55-65 (women) cohorts could

provide a source of labour as the age cohorts of retirement age grow in size. Finally, the Soviet economy may be

defined as one of full employment. This does not imply that the economy is without forms of unemployment or

underemployment, topics we shall return to in Chapter 4.

## 3 Planned and Market Labour Mobility

Soviet spokespersons regard the ending of unemployment in the 1930s as being coterminous with the abolition of the 'reserve army' of unemployed labour and the ending of the labour market in the USSR. This is a half-truth. Compared to capitalist market societies, it is the case that wages were not effective  in  regulating  the  supply  of  labour,  and  the  absence  of  a  pool  of unemployed made dismissal less effective as a means to discipline labour. The other part of the story is that the 'planning' of labour was only partial. At  most,  about  a  quarter  of  entrants  to  the  labour  force  came  from Orgnabor (the department concerned with labour supply)  and these did not 1 necessarily  stay  in  their  first  jobs.  The  vast  majority  of  workers  were recruited through informal channels and in practice moved from one job to another. Enterprises attempted to optimize their labour force by persuading valued  workers  to  stay  and  to  attract  others  from  outside.  In  this  more limited  sense,  a  labour  market  existed  and  continues  to  the  present  day. Imperfections  in  labour  markets  and  in  the  planning  of  labour  lead  to various types of unemployment which will be discussed after considering how the labour force is placed in jobs.

There are now six types of 'planned' mobility of labour (planned in the sense that there is some form of administrative recruitment and direction) in the USSR: (i) Orgnabor; (ii)  'transfers' of skilled workers within a branch of industry; (iii) 'social appeals' involving the mobilization of youth in new building projects; (iv) resettlement of families, usually from areas of rural labour  surplus  to  areas  of  deficit;  (v)  labour  exchanges  which  are  not 'directive'  in  character;  and  (vi)  the  placement  of  graduates  of  various educational and training institutes under various Ministries. 2

The respective weights of the various forms of recruitment including the market  are  shown  on  Table  3.1  for  the  Ukraine  (1975),  L'vov  province (1975)  and  the  Russian  republic  (RSFSR)  in  1980.  It  can  be  seen  that organized or administrative channels of labour placement control no more than 15 per cent of labour movements; labour bureaux only deal with some 10  per  cent  of  total  recruitment,  when  all  forms  of  recruitment  are  taken into account. Enterprises directly hire most hands, and in various oblasts of the USSR between 60 and 80 per cent of those taken on will have left other jobs.  While the job placement bureaux account only for 10 per cent of job 3 recruitment,  in  recent  times  their  role  has  increased,  the  proportion  of placements  by  them  rising  nearly  two  and  half  times  between  1970  and 1980. Comparative statistics for 1975 and 1980 for the Russian republic are shown on Table 3.2. Recruitment by enterprises themselves fell by some 14 per cent. The administrative allocation of labour must be considered in the context  of  the  'market'  continuing  to  be  the  main  way  in  which  labour  is recruited-though the 'market' for labour does not adjust its price (wages) as freely as in market systems. This has led to the rise of a second economy and various forms of self-employment.

## Orgnabor

When it was introduced in 1931, Orgnabor's principal  task  was  to  recruit labour from collective farms to urban industry. In practice, collective farms were required to provide industrial enterprises with labour. The collective farmer was denied individual mobility. In such a way 'transitional unemployment'  was  eliminated  and  Soviet  Russia,  bad  though  urban housing  was,  did  not  experience  the  shanty  town  and  mass  poverty conditions  of  many  developing  societies.  Also,  fo  rced  labour  projects organized  by  the  security  services  used  prisoners  to  make  up  deficits  in labour supply. In the 1930s, 2-3 million prisoners (about 15 per cent of the workforce) might have been engaged in building, mining and lumber, 4 (this includes the bulk of the criminal population who are required to work). No data are currently available on the extent of this practice; one estimate in 1982  is  that  3  million  people  work  in  camps  felling  timber,  building  gas pipelines and other construction projects,  (total employment in 1982 was 5 127.9 million).

By 1953 the agencies of Orgnabor directed mainly urban workers from areas  of  labour  surplus  to  those  of  deficit.  Since  1967  the  agencies  of Orgnabor have been subordinate to the Republican State Committees on the Use of Labour Resources. The plans for labour procurement are made in the

Republican Gosplans after considering requests from Ministries and other production  organizations.  Gosplan  USSR  coordinates  the  flow  of  such workers between branches of the economy and different republics. In the pre-war  period  urban  workers  numbered  some  15  per  cent  of Orgnabor' s total; by 1971/74 they came to 73.7 per cent. Orgnabor now helps relocate workers in the far north, Kazakhstan, the Urals, Siberia and the far east. In the  1951-69  period,  a  third  of  transferred  workers  in  the  RSFSR  went  to Siberia  and  the  far  east;  by  1974  this  had  risen  to  49  per  cent.  For  some industries,  most  of  the  workers  were  sent  to  Siberia  and  the  east:  in  the Ministry  of  Communications  the  proportion  was  89.4  per  cent;  industrial and construction materials, 87 per cent; transport construction, 75 per cent; and timber, 79 per cent. Of the total number of workers taken on in industry by enterprises in 1974,4.7 per cent came through Orgnaborin fishing the proportion  was  12.4  per  cent,  and  in  timber-felling,  11.8  per  cent. 6 Most workers  coming  under Orgnabor are  unskilled,  over  25  years  of  age  and unmarried  (only  2.4  per  cent  took  their  families).  They  sign  on  for  short contracts-under  six  months,  or  from  one  to  three  years.  In  1974,  threequarters  of  workers  recruited  through Orgnabor were  on  at  least  yearly contracts.

In  1984  some  400,000  persons  a  year  were  being  channelled  through Orgnabor to  work  in  labour-deficient  areas:  85  per  cent  were  under  40 years of age and 70 per cent had a trade. Since 1984, workers who sign up for a fixed minimum term period are to have greater payments, better travel conditions,  and  the  amount  of  baggage  carried  has  been  doubled.  An allowance is made for travelling time and special loans are available fo r setting up home. 7 Workers are bound by their contracts and can only leave without penalty if the administration fails to honour their contract. If they leave for any other reason, it is considered as absenteeism and the worker loses his uninterrupted work record, he may also be fined and have to pay his own fare home. Research has shown that conditions (housing, catering, leisure) are often poor and that many workers leave before their contract is fulfilled. 8

Transfers within Industrial Ministries

The  most  obvious  form  of  direction  takes  place  within  enterprises  or industrial  conglomerates.  The  larger  the  industrial  unit,  the  greater  the internal mobility-and the lower the rate of labour turnover as measured by workers handing in their notice at the plant. In the early 1970s, one study showed  that  about  8  per  cent  of  the  workforce  changed  jobs  internally. Those  who  move  to  other  enterprises  by  agreement  with  the  heads  of enterprises averaged 3-4 per cent of the workforce per annum between 1967 and 1974. 9

Planned movement within branches of industry is usually associated with the transfer of workers to new enterprises. For instance, the new Volga car factory built between 1970 and 1972 recruited 8000 skilled workers from other car plants. When various forms of internal reorganization take place either through  closing  down  plants  or  through  managerial  initiatives, workers who change jobs are benefited in the  following  ways:  they  keep their  uninterrupted  work  record  (this  also  applies  to  a  spouse  who  also decides to move); they receive payment when moving and retraining; they have priority  in  housing  and  childcare:  they  receive  expenses  for  moving and  a  lump-sum  displacement  based  on  their  average  salary;  and  their dependants  also  receive  an  allowance. 10 Such  mobility,  sponsored  within industrial  branches,  is  relatively  underdeveloped.  Maslova  calls  for  the following  improvements  and  changes  in  organization:  transfers  and  their associated  rights  should  be  extended  to  enterprises  outside  the  branch  of industry;  a  uniform  statute  should  be  enacted  standardizing  and  applying the conditions of internal transfers to all displaced workers; where retraining  for  jobs  in  short  supply  takes  place,  workers  should  be  able  to receive their previous level of wages. 11

## Social Appeals

A peculiarly Soviet form of meeting labour shortages is the device known as 'social appeals' ( obshchestvennye prizyvy ). This form of recruiting labour was first organized by the Young Communist League (Komsomol) in 1956. It involves participation in permanent employment, chiefly in construction and in enterprises in the northern and eastern areas of the country. Young

people leaving school or college figure largely in this group. In 1971, threequarters of the Moscow Komsomol's appeal included young people between 18 and 25 years of age; 83 per cent were Komsomol members. The height of this movement was in the 1956-65 period when 1,800,000 young people volunteered for work: of these 1,100,000 enrolled on seven-year contracts. 12

Another form of 'social appeal' is that of the summer student detachments who  normally  work  for  a  short  period  on  building  projects.  In  1967, 100,000  students  participated  on  such  schemes,  a  figure  which  rose  to 619,000 in  1974. 13 These  volunteer  shortterm  workers  provide  labour  for building projects such as the trans-Siberian railway. Usually such workers do not have relevant skills and 75 per cent have to be trained on the job. 14

## Resettlement of Families

This  form  of  labour  movement  enables  agricultural  areas  with  labour shortages to be populated. Such resettlement was especially important in the early 1950s. Since that time the numbers participating have fallen. Taking 100 as the average movement between 1951-1955, the index fell to 59.1 in 1961-65  and  40.2  in  1971-74. 15 Since  1974,  the  following  benefits  are payable  to  families  wishing  to  move  voluntarily  to  rural  localities  where labour is needed. Travel and transportation of personal goods are paid for, and there are allowances of200 roubles for the head of the family and 75 roubles for each member; quarters are provided for resettlers; and on state farms  new  settlers  are  excused  paying  rent  for  two  years  after  moving. 16 Though the majority of families stay permanently, many move back from the Urals, Western Siberia and the Volga regions. Of settlers in the RSFSR in the period 1951-70, 13.6 per cent left after one year and 24 per cent after two  years;  by  1970-74  the  rate  had  fallen  to  6.9  per  cent  for  first-year leavers. 17 Major  dissatisfaction  lay  with  living  and  working  conditions. Despite improvements, discontent with conditions in rural areas continues. Most migration in the 1980s was of this form, accounting for 80 per cent of moves; only 20 per cent came under 'organized' schemes noted above. 18

## Employment Bureaux

In  1967,  employment  bureaux  were  reopened  in  the  USSR.  Such  offices were  organized  under  the  Councils  of  Ministries  of  the  Republics.  They provided  information  about  jobs  and  also  gave  advice  to  potential  job takers. They also had the functions of assisting the state planning agencies with measures for retraining and transferring labour and with formulating proposals  for  the  planning  and  national  utilization  of  labour.  The  state planning  agencies  (Gosplans)  coordinated  the  work  of  the  bureaux.  The bureaux not only deal with enquiries from workers seeking jobs but also are linked  to  special  commissions  for  certain  categories  of  labour:  youth, juvenile  offenders,  invalids  and  demobilized  officers,  and  ex-convicts. These commissions need not be described in detail here. It should be noted, however,  that  the  authorities  set  up  such  specialist  bureaux  in  order  to maximize the recruitment of all types of labour. People defined as invalids or  handicapped  are  the  responsibility  of  the  social  security  offices.  The organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs find jobs for exconvicts through job placement bureaux.

Youth Placement Commissions ( Kommissii po trudoustroistvu molodezhi ) are agencies of the local soviets. 19 Enterprises are supposed to reserve a certain proportion of jobs for school-leavers (around 5 per cent). School-leavers from ordinary schools are not obliged to use the Commissions: in 1979,35 per cent of leavers in Moscow did not do so and a similar  proportion  was  reported  for  Orel  in  1976. 20 As  far  as  vocational schools  (PTUs  and  SPTUs)  are  concerned,  these  are  invariably  linked  to 'base enterprises' or industries (such as the railways) which absorb graduates who are subject to initial placement in jobs. The same is the case with graduates of specialized secondary and higher educational institutions. Gosplan and the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, in  conjunction  with  the  'consuming'  Ministries,  draw  up  assignments  for graduates who are allocated to jobs, normally for a three-year period. This is a form of direct labour recruitment and by-passes intermediary bureaux.

The  placement  of  school  and  college  graduates  is  one  area  in  which Soviet planners can meet deficits and shortages. This system, however, has some  inefficiencies.  Many  students  'drop  out'-in  the  RSFSR,  180,000 students per annum prematurely leave educational institutions. 'No records

are  kept  on  these  people  and  no  purposeful  work  is  being  done  to  place them in jobs.' 21 Kotlyar has also pointed out that administrative placement often breaks down. He cites a report in Pravda (12 July 1981) to the effect that in 1981 in the Russian republic, enterprises and institutions refused to take  1,000  physicists,  more  than  1,100  chemists,  and  750  biologists  from universities. 22 Graduates also with impunity fail to tum up at their assigned jobs. 23

By  1974  the  employment  bureaux  covered  nearly  all towns  with populations of between 100,000 and 400,000, and in some republics they were  also  located  in  medium-sized  towns  of  50,000  to  100,000. 24 Of workers recruited to industry, 8.7 per cent in 1971 came from the bureaux and  14.1  per  cent  in  1974  (data  for  USSR).  In  some  republics  the proportions were higher: in 1974, in Armenia, it was 40.7 per cent, and in Uzbekistan, 22.8 per cent were so recruited. 25 In  the  1980s greater use of labour exchanges on a nationwide scale has been advocated to fill vacant jobs.  In  June  1980,  it  was  decreed  that  all  towns  with  populations  over 20,000 should have bureaux. By 1982, 830 towns had employment bureaux; in the course of the tenth Five Year Plan (1976-80), 13 million people were placed through them, and in 1982 and 1983, 6 million. 26 However, as noted above, the recruitment of most labour still takes place 'at the factory gate' rather than through offices. A study in 1980 of 156 production units showed that only 31 per cent of labour requirements were filled through administrative channels and of these 19 per cent were school graduates. 27 By  1982,  25-30  per  cent  of new job  seekers  used  the  job  placement services. 28 In Perm, it has been reported that 85 per cent of workers already have  jobs  before  they  leave  their  own  factories  and  labour  placement officers often fail to fulfil their placement assignments. 29

The  role  of  the  bureaux  is  as  an  intermediary.  Neither  worker  nor enterprise  need  take  the  job  or  the  worker  on  offer.  In  1973,  of  the  total number  of  enquiries  by  workers,  86.9  per  cent  were  sent  to  jobs  by  the exchanges;  64.6  per  cent  actually  took  them  Up, 30 that  is,  a  third  of  the offers were turned down. Most of those seeking and accepting jobs through the exchanges  were  younger  workers  with  lower  levels  of  education (primary or incomplete secondary).

The  bureaux  are  financed  by  the  enterprises  using  them,  though  many calls have been made in the Soviet press for a transfer of funds to the local soviets for support of job placement bureaux. 31 Fees vary as they are fixed by the republican price committees. Enterprises make an initial payment in accordance  with  their  size.  In  addition,  payment  is  also  made  for  each worker  taken  on  (e.g.  2  roubles  in  the  Russian  republic;  3  roubles  in  the Ukraine, 4 roubles in the far north). In some republics the enterprise only pays  a  fixed  fee.  Kotlyar  has  pointed  out  that  the  system  of  enterprises paying for job placements encourages a high turnover by the job placement bureaux. Their dependence on enterprises 'impedes the performance of their functions  of  supervising  the  utilization  of  manpower,  the  observation  of work-force ceilings etc.' 32 A study of bureau users in 1971 found that only 10  per  cent  were  seeking  their  first  job.  Of  the  remainder,  dissatisfaction with existing jobs was as follows: 35 per cent were dissatisfied with wages and conditions  of  work,  15.5  per  cent  wanted  better  housing  or  childcare facilities  or  to  live  closer  to  their  work,  6.2  per  cent  had  been  sacked  for disciplinary offences, and 4 per cent had been laid off or their contracts had come to an end. 33 In the RSFSR, 88 per cent of moves were within given localities (rayons), and only 2.7 per cent were to other republics. 34

The  main  difference  from Orgnabor is  that  the  worker  comes  to  the bureaux after having left his job on his own initiative. His labour contract is an  individual  matter  between  him  and  the  enterprise  and  the  potential recruit  does  not  receive  any  financial  incentives  to  take  up  the  post.  The bureaux  have  reduced  the  amount  of  time  between  jobs  by  from  five  to fifteen days depending on the locality. 35 An advantage of the bureaux is that through them, workers have a greater choice of job-in Leningrad in 1974, every applicant was offered two to three vacancies. 36 The most frequent use of exchanges is made by industry and construction.

The  bureaux  do  not  have  a  comprehensive  or  compulsory  coverage, though in some areas those dismissed for disciplinary offences have to be channelled through such offices.  Some enterprises  do  not  bother  with  the offices and rely on word-ofmouth communication and recruit 'at the gate'. Some even 'intercept' job seekers outside the labour exchange offices. 37 As a result the bureaux do not have a full picture of vacancies and become less useful to job seekers. They are often short of staff and are unable to deal with requests for jobs outside their areas. 38 Also enterprises do not send in

all vacancies and sometimes they ask for more labour than they really need. In 1984, for the RSFSR, it was reported that about 40 per cent of vacancies for  manual  workers  were  reported  to  the  labour  bureaux,  17  per  cent  for engineers and technicians, and 14 per cent for office workers. The position is  similar  in  other  republics. 39 Maslova  points  out  that  if  workers  made redundant  ('freed') by  an  enterprise refuse the jobs offered by  their employer, they lose their rights concerning the type of job they are entitled to  and  also  they  may  lose  their  uninterrupted  service  record. 40 Such  a procedure could be extended if the labour bureaux  were  made  the intermediaries in the job search; workers made redundant through technical advance or reorganization would be placed according to their qualifications without loss of earnings. 41

Kotlyar 42 is among the professionals who advocate that the responsibility for placing discharged workers in jobs should be transferred from Ministries,  Departments  and  enterprises  to  the  organs  of  the  USSR  (and Republican) State Committees on Labour and Social Problems. He points out  that  the  1970  resolution,  'On  the  Procedure  for  Strengthening  the Interest  of Workers in Increased Production Output, the Rising of Labour Productivity  and  the  Reduction  of  Employed  Personnel',  gives  Ministries, Departments  and  enterprises  the  obligation  to  find  work  for  displaced workers:  'This  frequently  places  the  administration  in  serious  difficulties and  impedes  the  disengagement  of  workers  who  are  awaited  in  other divisions  of  the  national  economy.' 43 However,  Kotlyar  also  notes  that workers  who  change  jobs,  and  even  those  fired  for  violating  labour discipline,  often  receive  higher  salaries  at  their  new  place  of  work.  A selective study (no details are given) found this to be the case in 30 per cent of  the  cases,  moreover  wage  rises  were  as  much  as  30  per  cent. 44 This would  seem  to  indicate  that  such  moves  were  often  to  the  worker's advantage. Only 12 per cent of job changers in the RSFSR return to their original  workplaces. 45 However,  Kotlyar  has  estimated  that  some  40  per cent 'of the overall total of job movements do not correspond to the interests of citizens, labour collectives or society as a whole' and entail unnecessary costs. 46 Job changers also regularly take up different trades: this occurred in 30  per  cent  of  all  cases  studied  in  the  RSFSR,  and  of  those  hired  at  'the gate',  52  per  cent. 47 Despite  Kotlyar's  specious  arguments,  this  is  not

necessarily  a  bad  thing,  as  the  labour  force  is  responding  to  industrial requirements.

## The Ufa-Kaluga Experiment

The imperfections in the market operating through the labour bureaux led in 1970 to the so-calle d Ufa-Kaluga experiment. 48 This system extended the rights of the employment bureaux in that area over most vacancies which had to be filled  through  the  bureaux. The  exceptions  were  leading  cadres (directors, chief engineers), professors and teachers, scientists, specialists in health and education, senior government employees, young specialists and youths finishing school and graduates of trade schools. 49 In all other cases enterprises  had  to  make  known  their  vacancies  to  the  labour  bureaux. Enterprises retained the right whether or not to hire workers sent to them by the  bureau. A  payment  of  3  roubles  was  made  by  the  enterprise  for  each person sent by the bureau and subsequently employed. 50

This system had some advantages. The authorities had a better idea of the labour  shortages  and  could  identify  enterprises  with  excessive  demands. This enables resources to be channelled to the training of labour. 51 In UfaKaluga, job changing when people took new posts was reduced by 5 per cent  in  Kaluga  and  12  per  cent  in  Ufa.  Registered  labour  shortages  in enterprises in Ufa dropped 2.2 times in 1970-72; in Kaluga the number of enterprises with employees in excess of planned targets was reduced from 40 to 17. The bureaux exercised an effective control over enterprises' labour recruitment.  From  1970  to  1984,  personnel  turnover  in  Kaluga  dropped from 17.8 to 11.6 per cent. 52

The  mandatory  scheme  however  has  not  been  adopted  in  other  areas where enterprises have been allowed to continue hiring workers independently.  This  is  probably  a  result  of  pressure  from  the  industrial enterprises and Ministries who objected to control over the labour supply by the  bureaux;  such  control  made  production  more  difficult  by  depriving enterprises  of  labour  reserves.  Individual  workers  also  objected  to  the scheme as it deprived them of choice. Hence 'planning' of labour comes into

conflict  with  powerful  enterprises  and  skilled  workers  who  have  a  shortterm interest in a labour market in conditions of labour scarcity. 53

## The Voluntarily Unemployed and SelfEmployed Sub-Cultures

The absence of planning over the labour force has led to a subculture of the unemployed, or 'parasites' and to the formation of gangs of self-employed labourers ( shabashniki ). These are relatively small groups of people outside the formal labour market.

The prevalence of voluntary unemployed people in the USSR has been the  concern  of  some  commentators  since  the  early  1970s  though  our knowledge of 'drop-outs' from employment is fragmentary. 54 Some evidence exists of a growing sub-culture of 'non-workers'. In the first half of the 1980s,  many  letters  were  published  in  the  press  concerning  the prevalence of parasites. In May 1983, Pravda reported that officials of the USSR  People's  Control  Committee  investigated several cities in the Ukraine, Chelyabinsk, Novosibirsk and other areas, and it was found that the  non-working  'parasitic'  population  was  equal  to  from  threequarters  to the  whole  of  the  reported  labour  shortage  in  these  areas. 55 Many  people were found to be permanently idle-that is, not working for a whole year. The Soviet  Procurator-General, A.M.Rekunkov  deplored  the  fact  that  'the law enforcement organs annually expose tens of thousands of citizens who have not worked anywhere for a long time . . ., one crime in four or five is committed by those who are not working or studying.' 56  The government newspaper Izvestiya (5  April  1985)  published  an  article  by  Professor  I. Karpets,  the  Director  of  the  Institute  for  Studying  the  Causes  of  and Elaborating Measures to Combat Crime in the USSR. He pointed out that: 'In  many  regions  there  has  been  a  noticeable  increase  in  the  number  of persons  not  engaged  in  the  sphere  of  social  production  and  leading  a parasitical life. . . . The parasite becomes a real violator of the fundamental principle  of  our  society  (the  principle  of  social  justice).  .  .  .  In  certain circumstances  attempts  to  live  at  other  people's  expense  are  directly

classified as criminal and such persons are forced to work in line with the court's sentence.'

The 'voluntarily unemployed' however, also includes those who are 'selfemployed'.  This  activity  involves  the  provision  of  services  'on  the  side', such as motor repairs, and painting and decorating. Brigades of 'migratory workers' ( shabashniki )  do  building  work  at  high  prices.  Karpets  concedes that such people are not strictly parasites, but as they often obtain materials and equipment illegally they engage in 'parasitic activity'. 'Parasites' in the sense  of  people  who  do  not  labour  and  enjoy  publicly  provided  services, often form part of a criminal sub-culture. In Latvia a study showed that one quarter of offenders were unemployed at the time of the offence, and that of these, two-thirds had 'led a parasitic way of life' for three years. 57 Another study in the Chuvash autonomous republic showed that 50 per cent of those convicted for leading a parasitic way of life had previous convictions, and 82 per cent were ordered by the court to undergo treatment for alcoholism. 58 An  estimate  of  500,000  'parasites'  living  in  the  USSR  has been  leaked  to  the  western  press,  allegedly  originating  from  the  First Deputy  Procurator  of  the  USSR. 59 Karpets  reports  that  the  'number  of people who lead a parasitic way of life is quite noticeable in a number of regions'. 60

In  late  1982  and  early  1983,  in  an  attempt  to  tighten  up  on  labour discipline  and  to  draw  as  great  a  number  of  the  working  population  as possible into the workforce, the authorities enforced the law on 'parasites'. This  law  (Article  209  of  the  RSFSR  criminal  code)  states  that  a  person (usually a man, because of the many exemptions for women) who has been living off others for four months can be charged with parasitism, as long as he  or  she  has  been  given  warning  after  three  months  to  find  a  job.  The sanctions are a maximum of two years' imprisonment for a first conviction and a minimum of one year and maximum of three years' imprisonment for a subsequent conviction for the same offence. 61 In  his  address to the 27th Party  Congress  Gorbachev  deprecated  the  persistence  of  parasites  and others who  misappropriate  socialist  property.  He  promised  'additional measures' against them in the near future. 62

These draconian administrative measures should not detract from the resp onsibility of government to provide work. Fifteen days after a request has been  received,  the  executive  committees  of  local  soviets  are  obliged  to

provide  work  and  accommodation  for  idlers.  Karpets  emphasizes  the  fact that the 'instructions of Soviet executive  committees  are  binding  on enterprises, institutions and organizations'. 63 Rekunkov points out that it is obligatory  for  directors  of  enterprises  and  other  establishments  to  employ people found idle, and sent to them by the police. Having been sent to a job, however, the authorities find it cumbersome to check whether the individual has continued in it satisfactorily. 64 In practice the law is difficult to enforce. Other  commentators  point  out  that  such  parasites  often  contrive  to  get themselves sacked. 'Assignment and treatment' centres fo r parasites find it difficult to obtain work for them. When they do so, vagrants often do not tum up for work but remain in the centre. 65

Employers  also  dislike  taking  on  such  employees  and  there  is  some evidence  to  show  that  the  employers  make  life  hard  for  them  by  giving them  more  (compulsory)  overtime,  and  send  them  to  help  out  in  other enterprises and in agriculture. 66 A report by the Deputy Chief of the Omsk Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  Administration  has  pointed  out  that  many enterprises,  'on  various  pretexts  .  .  .  "purposefully"  rid  themselves  of indisciplined  people  and  attract  reliable,  skilled  cadres  to  replace  them.' 67 He goes on to point out that dismissals and transfers have a bad effect on the  morale  of  such  workers  who  become  sources  of  public  disorder.  'The more people who are dismissed for negative reasons, the higher the overall level of crime'. Maintaining people in jobs has social benefits and a more stringent policy of labour efficiency leading to sackings would have social costs, borne by society at large. One may surmise quite confidently that the security  services  favour  full  employment  and  administrative,  rather  than market, methods to achieve it.

## Shabashniki

Despite the gloomy picture of crime and drunkenness given above, many so-called 'parasites' do useful work. Groups of people, typically men aged 25-40,  group  together  into  brigades  of  labourers.  They  take  on  jobs  in agriculture  and  building  on  a  piece-rate  basis  for  a  given  price.  Such workers are called shabashniki. Their wages range from twice to eight times

the regular rate for a job. 68 The 'economic mechanism' of such employment has  been  described  as  follows:  'The  migrant  labourer  is  given  complete independence in setting his goal and in choosing the means of achieving it. The  book-keeping  is  simple:  my  money  for  your  work.  If  there  are  no materials, find them.  If there's no  machinery,  get some.  There's no oversight, no supervision.' 69

The parasitical nature of shabashniki is derived not from not working but from  its  entrepreneurial  activity  and  from  a  tendency  of  such  groups  to obtain their materials illicitly. 70 Detractors regard them as having inflated or 'unearned'  incomes.  From  the  point  of  view  of  the  utilization  of  labour resources,  which  is  our  concern  here, shabashniki should  increase  the number of people at work though they are not employed by an enterprise for a wage. Though they may work for only part of the year (six to eight months), in 1984 Fedorchuk reported that thousands of brigades head for areas of labour shortage and that in some rural areas 50 per cent of building work was completed by them. A survey conducted in Armenia found that of seasonal workers going outside the republic, 55 per cent had previously not been employed, 20 per cent had had part-time jobs, and 25 per cent had jobs they did not like. The main incentive to work outside Armenia was the very high level of wages as most of the Armenians were poorly paid peasants. 71 In  the  RSFSR,  the  Republican  Goskomtrud  found  that  10-15,000  people participate for from six to eight months per year in shabashniki activity. In Armenia the figure is 25,000. 72 Their numbers in total have been estimated at  about  400,000. 73 In  the  mid-1980s,  opinion  turned  somewhat  in  their favour, and an article in Izvestiya pointed to their higher productivity and to the  fact  that  they  fulfilled  the  Leninist  criterion  of  payment  'according  to one's  work'. 74 Such  workers  are  also  geared  to  working  for  'end-results'. Fedorchuk,  in  the  same  interview,  conceded  that  penal  measures  alone could not overcome the illegal activities associa ted with shabashniki :  'the main  thing  here  is  to  improve  the  economic  mechanism'.  An  article  in Izvestiya has further pointed out that readers' letters indicate that employees of 'monitoring agencies' (i.e. those concerned with allocating and controlling labour) are opposed to shabashniki ,  whereas 'everybody elseeconomic executives, officials, workers, agronomists-is to one degree or another "in favour"'. The largest number of letters in favour originate from researchers and engineers. 75

## Control of the Labour Market

Current practice has moved  away  from  compulsory  registration and direction of labour because it limits freedom of choice by employees and employers. But influential writers such as Maslova 76 and Kotlyar argue for a  comprehensive  system  of  job  placement  organizations.  Even  by  the middle of 1984, only 15 per cent of job moves came under the control of local  agencies.  In  1984,  Kotlyar  pointed  out  that  labour  moved  from 'labour-deficit  regions  to  labour-surplus  [ones],  from  enterprises  whose staffs  were  below  strength  to  enterprises  with  above-plan  numbers  of employees.' 77 Such  a  system  would  enable  more  efficient  intraand  interbranch  mobility  to  take  place  and  would  facilitate  greater  geographical mobility.  Giving  an  institution  such  as  the  State  Committee  on  Labour responsibility for job moves would also 'relieve enterprises of the obligation to find jobs for the employees they released'. 78 The more 'spontaneous' job recruitment ('at the factory gate') would become redundant. Such proposals, including  the  setting-up  of  uniform  allocation  procedures,  administrative sanctions and fines on uncooperative officials have been widely canvassed in the USSR, but have not been taken up. 79

The organizing principles of labour placement are the market ('recruitment at the factory gate') which has been and is currently dominant in the USSR and administrative direction (the 'Kaluga Ufa ex[eriment'). A greater  emphasis  on  planning  and  discipline  will  encourage  the  Soviet authorities to move towards the weakening of rights of enterprises to recruit labour,  to  strengthen  the  placement  of  workers  through  labour  exchanges and  to  exert  sanctions  as  suggested  above.  Labour  experts  like  Kotlyar argue  pursuasively  that  recruitment  of  labour  by  enterprises  (i.e.  the  'free market')  differs  significantly  from  the  organizational  forms  ('planning')  of the socialist state. Clearly, enhanced administrative control of labour would entail giving more powers to labour placement agencies; this is an example of the 'strengthening of labour discipline' which has been emphasized under the  Andropov-Chernenko-Gorbachev  leadership. 80   The  higher  rates  of labour  mobility  required  by  more  intensive  forms  of  production  will probably  lead  to  the  introduction  of  severance  pay,  extended  periods  of retraining on full pay, 81 and the transfer of responsibility for re-employment

from  enterprises  to  labour  exchanges.  Such  measures  will  reduce  the number of 'parasites' and shabashniki. But more flexible payment of wages at enterprises as reward for 'end-products' is more likely to undermine the opportunity for self-employment.

## 4 Types of Involuntary Unemployment

While  mass  structural  unemployment  is  not  a  characteristic  of  the  USSR, one  must  consider  the  presence  of  other  forms  of  unemployment  and underemployment, the most important types of which are 'structural',

'seasonal' and 'frictional'. Structural unemployment is an absence of jobs in a particular labour

market. This usually occurs on a regional basis. Population grows in a given area at a faster rate than the

supply of jobs. In addition, certain districts might  be predominantly concerned with a particular industry having a relatively narrow and specialized  pattern  of  skills:  for  instance,  the  mining  industry  recruits  few women

workers, in textiles men are a minority and agriculture (at least in the USSR) has a preponderance of unskilled manual workers. 'Seasonal' unemployment is linked to the cyclical nature of production or of demand. In

the Soviet Union, due to the inclement winter weather, this is particularly the case  with  agriculture,  fishing,  open-cast  mining  and  building.  'Frictional' unemployment occurs when workers are idle between jobs or

statuses.  School-leavers  or  demobilized  military  may  not  wish,  or  may  be unable, to find suitable work

immediately.  If  workers  are  hierarchically  or  geographically  mobile  there may be periods of idleness between the time that workers leave one job and take up another.

## Frictional

## Unemployment

In any modern economy, however perfectly organized, there are likely to be periods  of'friction'  when  school-leavers  come  onto  the  market  or  when employees  voluntarily  change  jobs.  Instantaneous  individual  adjustments which would be necessary to equilibriate supply of (and demand for) labour even in a

perfectly free market are impossible to achieve: in any labour market there are  always  some  jobs  vacant  and  some  people  seeking  work.  This  is illustrated in Figure

4.1. At wage W, ONi is demanded, but only ON is employed. The frictional level of unemployment is

N-Ni. 1

Figure 4.1: Frictional unemployment

<!-- image -->

In market economies, it is usually reckoned that even with full employment,  2-3  per  cent of the workforce  will remain  'frictionally' unemployed. 'Frictional' unemployment is not usually counted in market

economies  as  giving  a  person  an  unemployed  status.  The  length  of  the period recognized as being 'between jobs', or actively seeking work, makes a great  deal  of  difference  to  unemployment  statistics.  People  unsuccessfully seeking work for less than four weeks are usually excluded, and in some

countries, such as Sweden, the qualifying period is as much as 60 days. 2

## Measurement of

## Turnover

Frictional unemployment  is the major source on which the rate of unemployment in the Soviet Union has been estimated by western experts. Such estimates are based on extrapolation from data on turnover ( tekuchest '). These  include  people  who  voluntarily  leave  or  are  dismissed,  but  exclude those who retire, join the armed forces, are transferred to other enterprises or participate in 'organized

transfers'  ( orgnabor ).  On  such  a  basis,  Mesa-Lago  and  Peter  Wiles  have attempted  to  calculate  total  Soviet  unemployment  rates  forthe  1950s  and 1960s. Mesa-Lago 3  calculates that in 1960, 20 per cent of the workforce lost an average of 27

work  days  as  a  result  of  changing  jobs:  this  gives  a  rate  of  'aggregate unemployment' at 3.3 per cent. As

Mesa-Lago  points  out,  however,  the  statistical  basis  for  these  calculations has  some  flaws.  Turnover  may  not  have  involved  any  time-lags  in  some cases  and  the  average  days  lost  may  not  be  representative  of  the  whole: turnover varies enormously between areas  (see below). 4

Nevertheless,  Mesa-Lago  concludes  that  a  rate  of  2-3  per  cent  is  'roughly indicative of the importance of

frictional  unemployment  in  the  USSR  due  to  job  shifts  among  industrial workers'.  Paul R. Gregory, on the basis of interviews conducted in the early 5 1980s with 2,800 Soviet emigrés living in the United States, estimates that the  level  of  unemployment  is  2½  to  3  per  cent. 6 Peter  Wiles,  basing  his

estimate  on  a 30  calendar  day  average  idleness  for  a  jobchanger  in Krasnoyarsk city, calculates a 1.3 per cent frictional

unemployment rate for the USSR. 7  In the Soviet journal Trud in 1974, it was reported that in the RSFSR 3.5 million people in

industry  and  building  changed  jobs:  it  was  further  calculated  that  this represented a loss of 400,000 person work years. If one expresses this as a proportion of total employment in industry and building one may calculate an annual rate of frictional employment of 1.5 per cent.  In the Belorussian 8 Republic in 1976/77, it has been calculated that the equivalent of 10-11,000 people  were  lost  to  production  in  industry  and  building  as  a  result  of turnover.  This represents a loss of under one per cent per year. 9 10

Turnover  varies  between  regions  and  between  industries.  In  1967,  it averaged 22.1 per cent in the USSR, with a range of from 18.6 per cent in Belorussia to 39.8 per cent in Tadzhikistan. 11 In the USSR, turnover fell in industry from 22.1 per cent in 1967 to 19.8 per cent in 1972. 12 Teckenberg cites  the  following  rates  for  the  RSFSR  for  the  late  1960s-in  the  coal industry: 17.1 per cent, metal: 14.8 per cent, chemicals: 18.8

per cent, machinery: 18.1 per cent, light industry: 20.8 per cent, construction materials: 34.4 per cent, the food industry: 35.7 per cent. 13 A study by Borisov in Minsk province found the following rates of turnoverin  all  industry  in  1975:  16.9  percent  (20.1  in  1970),  in  machine  tools  and metalworking: 18.2 per cent (22.4 in 1970), woodworking and cellulose and paper

industries: 11.3 per cent (17.6 in 1970), chemicals and petrochemicals: 21 per cent (25.4), light industry: 14.5

per cent (13.7), food: 26.6 per cent (30.4), glass: 10.5 per cent (17.5). This represents an average turnover of 16.6 per cent in 1975 and 20.1 per cent in 1970. 14 M.I.  Dolishni  provides  some  interesting  data  on  turnover  in  the Ukraine. In the eighth Five Year Plan (1966-70), turnover totalled 19 per cent of the industrial workforce per annum (about 1

million  workers  changed  their  place  of  work),  by  1970-75  the  average total  had  fallen  to  700,000,  representing  a  total  loss  of  1.5  per  cent  of industrial production. 15 In the early 1980s, 20 million workers changed jobs or retired each year; a third of these represented 'natural' transfers-joining the army or higher education, going on retirement

or invalidity pensions-giving a net rate of job changers of 14 per cent of the employed workforce. 16

To conclude, though levels of turnover declined in the late 1970s 17 and early  1980s,  one  might  estimate  a  range  of  1.3-1.5  per  cent  of  the  work force  being  frictionally  unemployed  at  any  time  in  the  USSR.  Labour turnover  is  not  necessarily  an  economic  cost  and  from  a  macroeconomic point  of  view  it  may  have  some  benefits.  But  Soviet  enterprises  regard turnover as a cost: it disrupts the work process, new workers require training, and they are initially less efficient.

Enterprises  anticipate  and  attempt  to  minimize  the  disruptive  effects  of turnover by 'overfulfilling' the

plan for labour: in 1975, Gosplan USSR planned 101.6 million jobs, and actual employment totalled 104.1 million. 18 The movement ( peremeshchenie )  of  individuals between regions, industries and trades is a necessary response to the changing requirements of industrial needs. From the point of view of the individual, turnover through dissatisfaction with one job may lead in another to greater satisf action and better conditi

ons. 19

## Comparative Study of

## Turnover

Though labour turnover has been stressed as a cause of unemployment in the USSR, it is not a phenomenon stemming from the socialist organization of work. The level of turnover in comparative perspective, despite the

protestations  of  some  Soviet  managers  and  economists,  is  not  particularly high. The data we have considered above give turnover rates of around 20 per cent for Soviet industrial production. 20 In an authoritative survey of the literature, James L. Price shows that the median reported level of the annual turnover in western (mainly American) goodsproducing industry was 50 per cent,  with  a  range  around  the  median  of  39  per  cent;  in  manufacturing industry the median was 54 per cent (range, 21 per cent) and mining 38 per cent  (range,  13  per  cent). 21 The  latter  figures  are  aggregated  averages  and some studies include separations due to retirement and death. Even so, rates of  turnover  under  capitalism  are  very  much  higher  than  in  the  USSR;  and American  rates  may  be  double  the  Soviet  figures.  (Rates  in  capitalist countries, however, may fall in periods of high unemployment.)

Labour turnover in the Soviet Union is a phenomenon which has many features  in  common  with  that  of  western  industrial  societies.  Studies  of turnover usually attempt to distinguish between rates for men and women, manual  and  non-manual  workers,  younger  and  older  workers  and  poorly qualified and educated workers. 22 A study carried out in Belorussia in 1974 of 1634

people at job placement bureaux found that 53.5 per cent of those who had given up their jobs were under 30 years of age; of these 67.6 per cent had primary  or  incomplete  secondary  education. 23 They  also  had Table  4.1: Motives of employees of very large industrial enterprises in Novosibirsk and the Altai Kray who left work voluntarily

short  service  records:  some  80  per  cent  of  voluntary  leavers  had  less  than three years' service and 53.4 per cent had less than one year. 24 Another study found  that  turnover  among  16-29  year  olds  was  four  times  greater  than among 30-39 year olds and 10-11 times greater than among those over 50 years  old. 25 Reasons  for  leaving  work  in  industrial  enterprises  in  Lvov  in 1976 26 were as follows: 1.7 per cent because work was not available in their own trades, 6.6 per cent were dissatisfied with the nature of work, 6.1 per cent were

discontented with the organization ( rezhim) of  work, 13.2 per cent disliked the

distance  from  work,  12  per  cent  wanted  higher  wages,  2.2  per  cent  felt children's pre-school facilities to be inadequate, 6.9 per cent changed their residence,  and  35.2  per  cent  left  for  other  reasons.  Another  study  of voluntary  leavers  from  enterprises  in  the Altai  district  and  Novosibirsk  in Siberia found that 'personal

motives'  closely  followed  by  'standard  of  living'  accounted  for  the  highest proportion of those who

left.  The  'organization  of  labour'  accounted  for  relatively  few  moves.  The details are shown in Table 4.1.

Following Price's analysis of the western literature, we may concur that workers with long service have lower rates of leaving than those with short

service,  younger  workers  have  higher  rates  of  turnover  than  older  ones, lower  skilled  manuals  experience  more  turnover  than  the  skilled,  nonmanuals have lower rates than manuals, and women have higher rates than men. 27

The conclusion that levels of turnover are significantly lower than in the We  st  may  be  advanced  confidently  despite  the  ambiguities  in  statistical reporting. This is a surprising conclusion. One would expect that the higher the  rate of  labour  utilization  (i.e. in the  West,  the  lower  the  rate  of unemployment)  the  greater  the  level  of  turnover. 28 As  March  and  Simon have  expressed  it:  'Under  nearly  all  conditions,  the  most  accurate  single predictor  of  labor  turnover  is  the  state  of  the  economy.' 29 Price  points  out that  'No  evidence  could  be  located  which  contradicts  the  hypothesised relationship  between  level  of  employment  and  turnover.' 30 In  the  Soviet Union,  however,  the  growing shortage of labour  would  appear  to  be associated with a decline in turnover rates.

## Limitations on Labour

There  are  a  number  of  institutional  variables  which  may  explain  why Sovietrates are lower than western ones.

satisfaction.  'Satisfaction'  is  linked  to  a  number  of  variables.  In  the  West level  of  pay  plays  an  important  though  by  no  means  the  only  part  in  an individual's satisfaction with work. Low pay,

other things being equal, leads to dissatisfaction and labour mobility. 31 Pay, however, does not respond to shortage in the USSR in the same way as in the West and wage differentials are much lower. Nevertheless, while wagescales are laid down by national and local bodies of Goskomtrud, there is in practice  considerable  responsiveness  of  earnings  to  local  conditions  and relative labour shortage. Pay responds to shortage, but not to the same extent as  in  western  capitalist  labour  markets. This  can  be  illustrated  by  the  data collected  in  Belorussia  (Table  4.2)  where  workers  of  an  identical  skill working in various factories are shown to receive different levels of wages. Policy,  however,  is  to  reduce  these  differences  which  are  put  down  to inadequate 'norming' policy.

Generally  speaking,  workers  of  a  given  skill  grade  should  receive  an identical  wage  for  identical  work,  unlike  under  capitalism  where  wages should be linked to what particular labour markets can pay. As noted above,

dissatisfaction  with  pay  figures  prominently  as  a  subjective  cause  for leaving-21.4 per cent in industry, 29.6

per  cent  in  the  public  service  sector,  23.4  per  cent  in  transport  and communications. 32  Turnover is also linked to wage levels: workers earning under 120

roubles  had  a  22.5  per  cent  turnover  rate,  those  earning  120-30  roubles 20.3 per cent, and for those earning 130-40 roubles it fell to 17.9 per cent. 33 These figures again may be related to skill level and length of service. Of crucial significance is that in the USSR a given pay rate does not, through inflation, decline in real income terms to the same extent as it has done in the West.  Satisfaction  is  only  marginally  increased  with  a  pay  rise,  though dissatisfaction more than

proportionally rises with a fall in pay.

The 'level of integration' of the worker has been found to be a significant determinant of turnover in the West: it is inversely related to turnover. Where workers  have  high  levels  of  participation  in  primary  group  relations  then integration is  high  and  turnover  low. The Soviet factory attempts to create positive

identification  on  the  part  of  the  workforce. The  relatively  high  levels  of participation in social, economic and political organizations at the workplace, particularly in large and successful enterprises, have led me to

conclude  that  the  Soviet  worker  has  a  high  level  of  identification  with his/her work

groups. 34 The provision of social services and housing through the factory collective distinguishes the Soviet factory from that in the West. The lack of

housing  in  the  vicinity  of  a  potential  new  employer 35 is  an  effective deterrent  for  workers  to  stay  put-though  they  do  not  lose  their  factory housing should they change jobs.

The other most important determinant of labour mobility is opportunity. In the  West,  full  employment  gives  rise  to  opportunity.  Though  the  labour market  is  imperfect,  knowledge  is  relatively  widespread  and  workers  are able  by  changing  jobs  to  better  their  conditions,  pay  and  status.  Fewer women have fulltime employment and the need for two or more members of a family unit concurrently to find suitable jobs does not happen as often as in the USSR

where full-time employment for married women inhibits their geographical  mobility.  In  the  West,  mobility  is  also  enhanced  by  a  free market for housing in the private sector: here again is a structural difference with the USSR, where the private urban housing market is small. Outside of local networks, knowledge of available jobs is low in the USSR. There is no national  labour  market.  Job-placement  bureaux  are  of  limited  and  local utility.  The  media  is  not  developed  as  a  source  of  job  recruitment,  and competitive recruitment is not practised. Hence in the

Soviet  Union  knowledge  of  job  opportunity  is  low  and  this  deters turnover, even though people are not

administratively prevented from moving to new jobs.

One other caveat, should be borne in mind when comparing Soviet with capitalist  market-type  societies.  Transfers  and  displacement  occur  in  the Soviet Union within enterprises and administrative units, such as industrial

ministries. Charged with the responsibility of finding work for displaced workers and having a shortage of

labour, enterprises are usually large enough to transfer excess labour from one plant to another. As in western societies, large-scale employers produce low levels of turnover 36 as displacements may  be absorbed in the organization  which  has  many  of  the  characteristics  of  primary  rather  than secondary markets, providing careers and not just jobs for employees. The variation in turnover by size of factory in the USSR is shown on Table 4.3:

Industry.  Turnover  at  the  smallest  factories  (under  200  workers)  is  three times as great as at the largest (over 1000). The large enterprises have great advantages in providing varied and constant work and resources to finance a wide range of social activities and welfare services (factory shops, holiday provision, kindergartens, health services and housing). As shown in part (b), very large factories provide 7-15 times the services for the

workforce compared to very small enterprises. At present, Soviet enterprises have a responsibility to find

alternative work for workers displaced by new technology or reorganization and this stimulates within-factory mobility. Western firms, however, have no responsibility for finding work for their redundant employees and the onus falls on the employee and is facilitated by the government through the labour exchange  and  welfare  maintenance  policies.  The  economic  system  in  the USSR ensures not only full employment, but also job security.

## Structural

## Unemployment

Structural unemployment is defined as a lack of demand for certain types of labour caused either by a reduction in demand for particular products or as a result of an increase in the supply of workers. In advanced western market economies shifts in demand for products lead to regional imbalances in the labour market: for instance, a reduction in primary industrial output causes unemployment  in  mining  and  agricultural  areas.  In  western  countries  in recent  years,  the  increased  numbers  of  women  seeking  work  is  another source of structural unemployment. An economy may solve such imbalances either by moving workers from areas of labour surplus to labour scarcity or by creating jobs in areas of labour surplus. An excess of labour in peasanttype agriculture is not strictly

'structural  unemployment'  for  reasons  discussed  above;  it  is,  however,  a waste of labour resources.

Demographic changes in population affect labour supply independently of the existing location of industry. The 'labour supply' in any country has to be seen in a geographical perspective because workers are members

of  families  and  localities  and  local  networks  tend  to  inhibit  mobility. Industrial  development  and  population  reproduction  are  never  perfectly symmetrical. In the USSR, the major potential mismatch between population

supply and labour demand is to be found in the growth of the labour supply in the Central Asian areas of the country among the agricultural indigenous population whereas the major industrial developments are occurring in the

Siberian  areas  and  the  traditional  European  zones.  The  chief  structural change in demand is likely to be for labour associated with intensive growth in the tertiary sector. Before  considering  Soviet  policy  on  population migration  and  industrial  location,  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  may  be indicated by study of the changes in

labour supply.

## Demographic Change

The major sources of, and shifts in, population in the various republics of the USSR are illustrated on Table 4.4. This table shows population growth for the USSR from 1950 to 1980, broken down into the various republics. While each  republic  shows  an  increase  in  population  from  1950  to  1980,  the relative share of the Slavic republics (RSFSR, Ukraine and Belorussia) fell from 81.6 per cent in 1950 to 74.8 per cent in 1980. The annual percentage increase in the Central Asian

republics  (Uzbekistan,  Kirgiziya,  Tadzhikistan  and  Turkmenia)  was  3  per cent between 1950 and 1980, and for

Kazakhstan was 2.7 per cent. These figures, of course, reflect the ageing of the population and do not directly indicate the proportions in the various age groups.

The birthrates  by  republics  are  shown  on Table  4.5.  Compared  with  the national  average  of  17.4  in  1970  and  18.9  in  1982,  the  Central  Asian republics ranged from 30.5 to 35.2, and from 31.2 to 38.7 on the two dates respectively. These figures again confirm the rapid growth of population in Central Asia, Kazakhstan and the Caucasus and the almost static birthrate of the

European, and especially the Baltic, republics.

These  data  may  be  further  refined  between  urban  and  rural  populations and between the various nationalities.

## Table 4.6 depicts the proportion of rural

population by republics. This shows the preponderance of village-dwellers in Central Asia in 1979: Uzbekistan 59

per cent, Kirgiziya 61 per cent, Tadzhikistan 65 per cent and Turkmenia 52  per  cent.  The  number  of  collective  farmers  is  again  highest  in  Central Asia: compared with an All-Union average of 14.9 per cent it is 24.7 per cent in Uzbekistan, 20.3 per cent in Kirgiziya, 26.3 per cent in Tadzhikistan, and 33.4 per cent in Turkmeniya.

The eponymous nationalities in the Central Asian republics are clustered in collective farms in the rural areas.

The rural locations of the Central Asian nationalities are shown on Table 4.7. Only 25.6 per cent of Russians were rural in 1979-34.4 per cent in the RSFSR. Of the Central Asian nationalities, however, 67.7-80.4 per cent were rural  in  1979-an  average  of  76.5  per  cent  of  Central Asians  within  their titular republics. Study of the figures over time shows a much greater rural decline for Russians than for the Central Asian nationalities.

M Feshback, 'Trends

On  the  basis  of  these  data  one  may  conclude  that  increases  in  the workforce  will  occur  in  the  Central  Asian  areas  of  the  country,  and principally among the eponymous population. Such increases will take place among the rural population.

Earlier we discussed the labour force participation rate for the population of  the  USSR.  Our  present  task  is  to  define  it  in  the  various  republics. As previously  pointed  out,  there  is  no  direct  Soviet  statistic  available  on  this topic.  One  can,  however,  express  the  total  numbers  of  manual  and  nonmanual workers for a given year as a proportion of the economically active age groups 16-54/59. These are calculated on Table 4.8. The crude employed labour participation rate has been calculated by dividing the total number of manual  and  non-manual  workers  (column  4)  by  the  economically  active population  age  groups  (16-54/59)  (column  3).  This  statistic  has  some imperfections; column 4 includes pensioners working full-time, and column 3 includes students and members of the armed forces. It also excludes from the employed population collective farmers and those in private agriculture. For our purposes, however, column 5 does indicate variations in the regional levels of labour utilization. Set against an average participation rate for the USSR

of 72.6 per cent, the Central Asian republics have low scores ranging from 50.3 per cent (Tadzhikistan) to 58.7

per cent (Kirgiziya). These low participation rates reflect the low level of urbanization and the large

collective farm work force.

The Soviet census of 1979 defined the economically active population 37 ( zanyatoe )  and those in private agriculture. Table 4.9 shows the republican breakdown, with figures for men and women. One cannot directly extrapolate from the data shown to levels of underemployment. The numbers reflect  the  age  distribution  of  the  population-a  population  with  many children will obviously have a lower level of employment than one with a preponderance  of  young  adults.  As  the  populations  of  the  Central  Asian republics have a large number of young dependants, one might expect the proportion of 'employed' to be

lower  than  that  of  the  European  republics.  This  is  indeed  the  case-the Central Asian republics have a range of 41.5-45.5 per cent for men compared to the USSR average of 55.7 per cent, and 37.0-39.5 per cent for women

compared to an All-Union average of 47.8 per cent. With the ageing of the populations, many more Central Asian nationalities will come into the labour market. Labour participation rates are particularly low in the Central Asian villages, and here is a reservoir of labour supply. In addition, the traditional use  of  children  in  the  fields  increases  the  number  of  workers  available:  a sociological  study  of  mobility  in  the  Uzbek  and  Thrkmen  republics  found that over a third of school-age children worked in the fields for six or more months a year. 38

We may summarize our discussion so far as follows. The Central Asian republics  have  a  rapidly  growing  population  which  is  located  among  the eponymous  nationalities  which  are  predominantly  rural.  The  European nationalities  have  a  stable  population  profile;  the  proportion  of  old  age dependants is likely to rise significantly. Two main

sources of increased labour supply may be identified: first, the post 55/59 age groups on pensions, predominantly in the European areas; and, second,

the  Central  Asian  nationalities.  The  former  are  in  areas  with  existing  job vacancies  and  have  appropriate  skills.  The  latter  nationalities  are  in  rural areas lacking employment

opportunities at present, and young people there have insufficient industrial and commercial skills.

## Migration

Demand for labour in the 1980s is in the industrialized European areas of the country and in the developing parts of West Siberia. However, Soviet writers recognize that in western Siberia, the Urals, the Volga and the Central Black Earth areas, more people leave than arrive. In some of the European mining areas, the exhaustion  of supplies leaves a surplus of workers  to be redeployed and the development of the oil and gas

complex in such areas as Tyumen led to labour shortages in western Siberia for industry and agriculture. Despite wage differentials, population has also moved  away  from  western  Siberia. 39 Migration  to  these  areas  has  been largely  of  European  rural  populations;  the  rural  Central Asian  nationalities have  remained  in  the  collective  farms  in  the  countryside.  Between  the censuses of 1970 and 1979, the rural population of Kirgiziya rose by 18 per cent, Uzbekistan by 21 per cent, and

Turkmeniya by 28 per cent. 40 Here population is grouped m the traditional large, extended family. In 1979, the average size of Russian ethnic families was 3.2-for Uzbeks it was 6.2, for Kazakhs 5.5, Kirgiz 5.7, Tadzhiks 6.5 and Turkmens 6.3. 41 The pattern of migration between the Central Asian and European parts of the country differs: in the former, males leave the villages for  work  in  the  cities  and  women  stay  in  the  villages.  Central Asian  rural women not only remain unemployed but also maintain the traditional way of life.

As  noted  above,  the  republics  of  the  Caucasus  and  Central  Asia  have lower levels of employment than elsewhere.

The journal Zarya Vostoka has pointed out that the republic of Georgia has a much lower index of participation of people in social production than the national average. During the ninth Five Year Plan, 'the development rates of industry  and  construction  were  insufficient  to  produce  a  substantial  rise  in the  employment  level  of  the  ablebodied  population.' 42 A  correspondent  of Pravda, discussing  the  malutilization  of  labour  resources  in  the  Tadzhik republic pointed out that 'The number of unemployed women

increases each year, and the main reason is that they have no opportunity to  learn  a  vocation.  .  .  .  the  Tadzhik  Republic  State  Planning  Committee excludes  mothers  with  several  children  from  the  manpower  resources  and thereby creates the illusion of high employment.' It has also been pointed out that mechanization of agriculture

leads to job losses. 43 In Kirghizia, it has been reported that a third of those employed  in  domestic  work  and  private  plots  could  be  employed  in  paid labour  if  there  were  the  jobs  available. 44 Similarly,  in  Turkmenia  in  1979, two writers from the Turkmen Labour Research Institute mentioned the need to  increase  the  level  of  employment,  given  the  rise  in  the  able-bodied population.  They  recommended  the  provision  of  light  industry  and  the production  of  more  local  consumer  goods. 45 The  needs  of  the  growing population have also been noted by Geydar Aliev, when First Secretary of the Azerbaydzhan Party organization. In 1976, he pointed to the 'considerable number'

of employable  people without jobs and the need for further new building. 46

Unemployment has also been reported in the RSFSR to be greater in small and medium towns and in the rural areas, whereas in large towns there is a deficit  of  labour. 47 An  exceptional  view  has  been  attributed  to  A.  G. Aganbegyan who, in 1965, was reported as saying that in small and medium towns, 25 to 30 per cent of the population 'able to work'

were unable to find work, and the comparable figure in large towns was 8 per cent. 48 These figures are not qualified in the reported speech-we do not know whether they refer to the total population (including pensioners) or to those  coming  onto  the  labour  market;  we  also  lack  information  about  the duration of such unemployment and whether the reference is to the lack of jobs  available,  or  to  the  absence  of  acceptable  jobs  on  offer.  Such  a statement interpreted literally is contrary to all other evidence on the scale of unemployment.

The Soviet  demographer  Perevedentsev  has  summed  up  the  position  on structural  employment  as  follows:  areas  of  labour  surplus  are  located  in Central  Asia, south Kazakhstan, Transcauca sia, the north Caucasus, Moldavia and the western Ukraine. There is an acute shortage of agricultural labour in the Non-Black-Earth zone, the Urals, Siberia and the far east. He proposes  a  population  shift,  with  the  urban  population  of  the  Non-BlackEarth  region  going  back  to  the  countryside  and  urban  people  from  the southern  areas  moving  to  the  urban  areas  of  Europe.  A  further  move  is recommended  of  rural  people  from  the  southern  regions  to  the  southern urban areas. This scenario involves a movement of European peoples out of the southern areas. 49

## Rural Underemployment in

## Central Asia

The  tendency  towards  low  geographical  mobility  and  insularity  of  the eponymous nationalities is explained by their religious and ethnic background and their poor command of the Russian language. The standard of living in areas of labour  shortage  outside  of  Central  Asia  is not sufficiently higher to compensate for the harsher climate: the cost of living in Central Asia is 10 per cent lower than in the central Russian regions and collective  farmers'  earnings  are  higher:  outward  mobility  would  lead  to  a 'worsening of [the

inhabitants'] material conditions'.  Diffe ent f 0 o kways or ways of life would be  experienced  by  immigrants  from  the  Asian  sun  belt.  Urban  dwellings have been built for smaller families and this creates an obstacle to mobility. 1 Private agricultural production in Central Asia is very profitable and a move to another area might well entail a fall in income. 2 The large families leave many women outside employment; in the early 1980s, in the urban areas of Tashkent, Andizhansk arid Bukhara, 30 per cent of the population was not employed. Women constituted 92 per cent of the non-working able-bodied population 80 per cent of whom had

## children. 3

In Tadzhikistan, employment bureaux have been set up and the resettlement  of  some  of  the  population  outside  the  republic  has  been planned. 54 Without migration to urban areas it seems likely that considerable underemployment will be absorbed in the collective farms of Central Asia and policy has been to develop industrial enterprises in small and medium settlements there. Many enterprises have been built in the countryside in the 1970s and, as a result, the proportion of manual and

non-manual workers in rural areas rose from 7.4 per cent in 1960 to 13.3 per cent in 1977. 55

However, the labour reserves in the countryside have not been absorbed by such developments. As an Uzbek economist has pointed out, mechanization  of  agriculture  has  occurred  more  quickly  in  cotton  farming than new jobs have been created. In 1970 the State Committee on Labour of Uzbekistan estimated that 29 per cent of collective farmers had been made surplus  to  requirements.  Since  then  the  proportion  has  risen  even  more. 56 This has led to a 'forced retention' of workers in agriculture. 57 A review of the  situation  in  Tadzhikistan  by  A.  Gelischanow  points  to  the  inadequate level of jobs in the rural areas. The

journal Kommunist Tadzhikistana reported a meeting between representatives of a

village and government administrators in which it was pointed out that the population  of  Surkh  was  outstripping  the  availability  of  jobs:  'There  is  no

work. The single . . . vegetable growing

sovkhoz cannot provide jobs for all. There is too little land and too little

water.'

58

Another report in Pravda pointed to the rural labour surplus in Tadzhikistan and the inadequate level of industrialization. The labour surplus in agriculture does not promote 'the mechanization of agricultural work and the transition to progressive forms of labor organization and remuneration . .

.' 59 Policy  is  to  maintain  jobs  at  the  expense  of  low  levels  of  income. Farms  in  the  European  areas  of  the  USSR,  in  contrast,  have  witnessed  a flight of  young  people  to  the  towns,  leaving  an  increasingly  old  and feminized workforce.

## Urban Labour

## Deficits

There is no evidence for structural urban unemployment in Central Asia up to  the  mid-1980s.  Most  commentators  conclude  that  despite  its  population growth, 'Central Asia has been experiencing a labour shortage'. 60 As inferred by the discussion above, the rural areas have population reserves, whereas the towns have a labour shortage. Rural

unemployment in Central Asia may be estimated at around 4 per cent. 61 This position is summed up by Kh. Saidmuradov, Chairman of the Council for the Study  of  Productive  Forces  of  the  Tadzhik  Academy  of  Sciences:  'A paradoxical situation arises: on the one

hand,  there  is  an  acute  shortfall  in  labor  resources;  on  the  other  hand,  an undoubted surplus.' 62 In Uzbekistan in 1978, R. A. Ubaydullayeva reported

'an acute shortage in labor resources' in the developing region. 63 The Deputy Chairman of the Uzbek State Committee for Labour Resources Utilization complained  of  the  low  rate  of  emigration  from  rural  areas  and  noted: 'Finding work for young

people  in  the  countryside  is  an  especially  complicated  problem.' 64 Rural overpopulation  and  underemployment  would  appear  to  be  occurring.  With mechanization, productivity in the countryside has been rising, thus reducing the number of jobs. 65 As Davlatov has pointed out: 'there is a contradiction between  introducing  brigade  methods  in  agriculture  [which  will  enhance labour efficiency] and the need to provide permanent work.' 66

Labour shortage in the towns has been met by the immigration of workers from the European areas of the country and by a greater participation in the workforce  by  the  indigenous  population.  In  industry  the  share  of  the workforce by Uzbeks was 31.2 per cent in 1967 rising to 38.2 per cent in 1977; in building the

corresponding figures were 34.8 and 35.6 per cent; in transport 41.2 and 44.4 per cent; in the massive Tashkent textile mills, the proportion of local nationalities employed rose from 17.1 per cent in 1966 to 40.3 per cent in 1979. 67 However,  such  developments  have  not  been  sufficient  to  meet  the urban need for labour and to relieve the overpopulation in the countryside. As the Soviet economist Manevich has pointed out, in the central areas of Russia a quarter to a third of the rural

population moves to the towns, whereas in Central Asia only 5 per cent does so. 'The indigenous peoples of

the Transcaucasian republics move to the cities of their own republics but very rarely to other regions of the country, and the Central Asian indigenous peoples resettle unwillingly even in the cities of their own

republics.' 68 In 1981, in Uzbekistan, 61.4

per cent of school-leavers who went to work found jobs in agriculture (12 per cent in industry and 6.8 per cent in building); of rural school-leavers a much higher proportion stayed in agriculture, and only 6 per cent worked in

industry.  'The  population  mass  remained  in  the  village  while  industry remained with insufficient

workers.' 69 G.  A.  Shister  has  complained  that  textile  factories  built  in Andizhan  and  Namegan  have  been  working  at  undercapacity  because  of labour

shortage. 70 Outmigration from the cities of skilled workers has also taken place  with  a  movement  of  the  non-indigenous  population  to  the  European areas  of  the  country  and  this  has  exacerbated  the  labour  shortage  in  the towns of Central Asia. 71

## Location of

## Industry

Soviet policy appears to favour the location of labour-intensive industries in small  towns  in  Central  Asia.  An  order  of  Gosplan  in  1977  required  that investment  plans  should  reflect  labour  supply  and  that,  therefore,  new construction should take place in Central Asia. Bromley and Shkaratan point out  that  it is often  suggested  that  traditional  industries  such  as  foodprocessing  and  light  industry  should  be  developed,  rather  than  metalworking  which  the  local  nationalities find uncongenial. 72 An  obvious strategy  would  be  to  bring  cotton  manufacture  to  Central  Asia  from  the RSFSR where labour is in short supply. 73 The labour force participation rate in Central Asia could then be increased. However,  in 1983, cotton procurement  prices  were  raised,  leading  to  increased  incomes  in  the  rural areas  of  Uzbekistan.  As  Sheehy  points  out,  internal  stability  is  probably more  important  than  using  unemployment  and  poverty  as  a  stimulus  to outward population movement. 74

Many  measures  to  stimulate  the  movement  of  population  have  been suggested.  Kostin,  for  example,  suggests  improving  urban  housing  and

living  conditions  and  raising  wage  incentives.  He  rejects  specific  policies aimed  at  different  nationalities  and  advocates  the  better  management  of existing labour resources and attracting

pensioners. 75 Bromley and Shkaratan recommend that the local lifestyles of  the  people  be  taken  into  account  in  industrial  policy. 76 However,  these recommendations  have  still  to be translated into policy options. The traditional textile manufacturing areas of Ivanovo were extensively refurbished  in  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  and  mechaniz  ation  of agriculture in Central Asia has been curtailed to allow surplus labour to be employed. 77 Kh.  Saidmuradov,  in  discussing  the  movement  of  industry  to small towns and settlements in Tadzhikist an, complains that Ministries are unwilling to site affiliates of major enterprises of the central industrial region in  Tadzhikistan. 78 By  1982,  however,  some  branches  had  been  set  up, particularly in the silk industry. These new factories experienced difficulties in recruiting skilled labour in the localities and productivity was only some 30 per cent of the parent enterprise. 79

The provision of paid employment is the policy of the Soviet government. But the provision of paid work requires the location of industrial enterprises in areas of population surplus or the movement of such surplus to new places of  work.  In  western  societies,  market  stimulation-the  carrot  of  a  higher standard  of  living  and  the  stick  of  rural  poverty-impels  labour  to  move. Such  migrants,  often  drawn  from  underprivileged  ethnic  groups,  form  the basis of a secondary labour market performing unskilled low paid jobs with no chance of advance and promotion. In the Soviet Union there is a lack of economic 'push': rural residents are shielded

from poverty by relatively adequate remuneration. The evidence suggests that the contentment of the Central Asian nationalities is regarded as a prime matter of policy and the social cost of underemployment is carried by

society as a whole. The absorption of labour into the rural community is partly a consequence of government

procurement policy in providing sufficient resources to maintain life in the countryside  thereby  enhancing  ethnic  harmony  and  political  stability.  It  is also partly due to the lack of 'pull by the towns over the rural

ethnic community. This in turn relates to the social barriers dividing ethnic groups and also to the absence at present of a consumer society qualitatively superior to traditional village life.

## 5 Labour Productivity

Whilst Soviet leaders and commentators, as well as those in the West, agree that 'productivity' and especially 'labour productivity' are currently the key to economic advance, what these terms entail and how they are to be achieved are  matters  of  ambiguity  and  dispute.  Discussions  of  'productivity'  involve the  whole  gamut  of  features  of  economic  life. As  Salter  has  put  it,  in  'the interpretation of even the simplest measures of productivity arises a host of very complex problems. For behind productivity lie all the dynamic forces of economic life: technical progress, [capital] accumulation, enterprise, and the institutional pattern of society.' 1

We may define productivity as the relationship between the aggregate of factor  inputs  (labour  and  capital)  and  the  aggregate  of  outputs.  Labour productivity is the contribution of labour to output. From the viewpoint of the  economy,  labour  input  has  three  main  aspects:  the  quantity  of  labour employed, its quality and organization. We have discussed the 'quantity' of labour  earlier,  in  terms  of  the  rate  of  labour  utilization.  'Quality'  and organization are our concern in this chapter. In making comparisons between societies and over time, it is important to bear in mind that labour is utilized with capital: the age, quantity and quality of the capital stock should also be taken into account in a comprehensive study of productivity. The quality of labour has to do with its effectiveness and efficiency. Experience, effort and educational  level  influence  the  ability  of  employees  to  perform  their  tasks efficiently.

Labour productivity, expressed as output per employee in a given period, may  rise  because  the  composition  of  capital  has  changed  or  because materials used have improved. Hence measures of 'labour' productivity may reflect changes in other factor inputs. Productivity may also be distinguished from efficiency. Low productivity says nothing about efficiency, because the latter is concerned with the effective utilization of inputs. Output produced may be such that no other organization of the given factors could increase it. Measures  of  economic  efficiency  must  compare  parallel  situations,  taking account  of  variations  in  capital  stock,  scale  of  production,  quantity  and quality  of  labour.  If  capital  and  materials  are  scarce  in  relation  to  labour inputs, then labour productivity will be low, though it may  not be

inefficiently  used. The  distinction  between  'intensive'  and  extensive  labour productivity hinges on changes in the content or quality of labour rather than on increasing the amount of labour employed.

## The Level of Labour Productivity

Labour  productivity  in  the  USSR  is  known  to  be  much  lower  than  in advanced  western  economies.  Bergson,  in  an  authoritative  comparative study, estimated that in 1960 gross material product per employed worker in the  USSR  was  only  31  per  cent  of  that  of  the  USA.  It  ranked  lower  than other West European countries in this respect: Italy's comparable output was 34 per cent, the United Kingdom's 49 per cent, Germany and France 51 per cent.   One  of  the  major  concerns  of  Soviet  planners  in  the  1980s  is  to 2 improve labour productivity: this has been a constant theme of recent Soviet leaders.  This  is  associated  with  the  movement  of  the  economy  from  an 'extensive' form of development to an 'intensive' one.

'In terms of historical scale, significance and implications, the regearing of our national economy along the lines of intensive development may rightly be placed alongside such a very profound change as socialist industrialisation  which  radically  altered  the  face  of  the  country.' 3 Soviet writers  on  the  economy  constantly  refer  to  the  need  to  'maximize'  and  'to improve  the  efficiency'  of  factors  of  production.  Tikhonov  in  the  same speech  referred  to improvements  in  labour  productivity  as  being  'the principal  factor'  in  economic  growth  under  the  eleventh  Five  Year  Plan (1981-85). It was planned that productivity of labour should rise between 17 and 20 per cent, and such increases were planned to account for 85-90 per cent of the growth of the national income.

'Pace,  quality,  thrift  and  organization  [ tempy,  kachestvo,  berezhlivost', organizovannost' ] these are the main slogans of the day. . .'  In these words 4 Gorbachev  epitomizes  once  more  the  goal  of  increasing  productivity.  The priorities  of  policy  are  'to  raise  labour  productivity,  improve  the  quality  of production, economise on resources'.  The 'acceleration of economic growth' 5 is crucial to the party programme and to the success of the twelfth Five Year Plan (1986-90). In his discussion of the revision of the Party Programme, Gorbachev emphasized the switch  to  the  'intensive  tracks  of  development'

and 'the attainment of a superior level of organization and efficiency for the Soviet economy.' 6 The draft Basic Guidelines for the Economic and Social Development of  the  USSR  in  1986-1990  and  in  the  Period  up  to  the  year 2000 calls  for 'a  shift [in] production  to  a  primarily  intensive  path  of development,  to  achieve  a  cardinal  increase  in  the  productivity  of  social labour, and to accelerate the rates of economic growth on that basis'. 7 The increase in national income in the twelfth Five Year Plan (1986-90) is to be achieved  'wholly  through  increasing  labour  productivity'.   The  goal  of  the 8 present Soviet leadership is to attain 'the highest level of labour productivity in the world'. 9

As  Gorbachev  stated  in  his  speech  in  October  1985  when  making  his report on the introduction of the new version of the Third Programme of the CPSU: 'in the new Five Year Plan, the increase in national income and in the output  of  all  branches  of  material  production  will,  for  the  first  time,  be obtained wholly through increasing labour productivity.' 10 There will be an increased rate of retirement of fixed assets, an increase in the rate of capital investment by 80-100 per cent and selectivity in investment; machine tools are to be favoured. 11 In the next Five Year Plan labour productivity is to rise 130 to 150 per cent. 12 The essence of Gorbachev's policy is that improved productivity  is  the  key  to  the  acceleration  of  economic  change,  and  the movement to the 'intensive track' of development. 13 In his election address, reported in Pravda on 21 February 1985, Gorbachev claimed that by 'using the same machine tools, the same equipment and the same land, it is possible to  produce more output and of better quality, with fewer outlays. . . . It is important  .  .  .  again  and  again,  to  study  all  of  the  factors,  all  of  the components, that ensure highly productive labour and enhance the mechanism  for  the  dissemination  of  advanced  experiences.'  Thrift  and business efficiency are the psychological attitudes to be fostered by management.

To  achieve  these  rates  of  increase,  the  work  process  has  to  be  more effectively organized, workers have to be more efficient: either more must be produced  with  the  same  levels  of  manning  or  a  given  level  or  production must  be  achieved  with  fewer  workers.  Soviet  experts  on  labour  suggest many  ways  that  labour  may  be  more  productively  used.  Kostin 14 is indicative of current thinking when he advocates eight major ways to utilize more effectively and efficiently labour resources: (1) the modernization of

equipment; (2) more investment in re-equipment rather than construction of new units; (3) greater flexibility in labour utilization, with multiple machine operation;  (4)  specialization  of  production  and  repairs;  (5)  greater  use  of scientific work organization (i.e. time and motion study); (6) the improvement  of  'moral  and  material  incentives'  at  work  and  'socialist competition';  (7)  the  reduction  of  loss  of  working  time  and  better  labour discipline and (8) limiting the number of employees.

In fact, however, the rate of productivity growth had suffered a long-run decline,  much  to  the  concern  of  Soviet  economists 15 and  political  leaders. Table 5.1 shows the growth of productivity of labour for the eighth (196670), ninth, (1971-75), tenth (1976-80), eleventh (1981-85) and the projected  increase  for  the  twelfth  (1986-90)  Five  Year  Plans.  This  table shows the decline in the rate of increase up to 1980. Tables 5.2 and 5.3 bring out,  however,  the  fact  that  productivity  in  absolute  terms  has  continued  to rise steadily since 1940. There are important variations in the sectors shown in  the  table:  machine  tools  and  metal-working  had  the  highest  growth  of labour  productivity,  light  industry  and  food  have  had  much  lower  rates. From 1980 to 1983, the fuel industry had a negative growth rate, falling to 99.6 in the latter year. 16

Annual national income for manual and non-manual employees has risen from 1292 roubles in 1960 to 3120 in 1984, 17 but the return on capital assets has  declined.  The  rates  of  growth  of  capital  ( fondovooruzhennost ') per worker employed in industry rose by 246 per cent between 1970 and 1984, and the average level of productivity in industry increased by 176 per cent (see table 5.4). The return on capital therefore has declined. Also the 'shift' index

measuring  the  utilization  of  equipment  fell  from  1.55  in  1959  to  1.42  in 1972: 18 by  1981 in metal-working it had fallen to 1.35. 19 Caution must be exercised, however, in interpreting such data. As the capital stock grows it becomes  increasingly  difficult  to  increase  the rates of  labour  productivity and a decline in the rate of growth has occurred in all industrial societies as they have matured.

The rate of obsolescence of capital has a direct effect on levels of labour productivity. The  introduction  of new  and  better  machines  raises  the productivity of labour through less downtime  through  fewer  workers producing a given output more quickly and with less breakdowns. The use of old  and  obsolescent  machinery  is not necessarily  inefficient.  Scrapping  of plant  is economically  desirable  when  it  fails  to  make  a  surplus  over

operating costs. Compared to high labour-cost economies, in low labour-cost ones, it  is  efficient  to  use  older  capital  and  the  capital  stock  will  therefore rationally be composed of much outmoded machinery. When investment is cheap  relative  to  labour  cost  a  high  rate  of  capital  retirement  takes  place. Abandoning 'outmoded methods' is not good management if labour is cheap and  capital  expensive  because  new  capital  may  be  more  expensive  to produce  a  given  output,  especially  if  labour  is  of  poor  quality  and  new equipment  needs  a  high  level  of  skill.  Studies  of  British  and  American industry,  for  example,  have  shown  that  American  productivity  is  higher because  the  rate  of  capital  retirement  is  higher.  This  is  not  due  to  'good management' but is economically justifiable because the USA has a higher level of real wages. 20

As noted above, in chapter 2, the Soviet Union has had a plentiful supply of labour, and has adopted an extensive rather than an intensive investment policy-i.e. it has added labour to capital rather than substituting labour for capital. However,  as  the  stock  of  capital  increases,  the  real  price  of investment  relative  to  labour  falls.  In  a  competitive  economy,  there  is  a market compulsion to replace obsolete plant because production in old plants is  costlier  than  in  more  modern  ones.  In  the  USSR,  however,  such  market compulsion  does  not  operate.  Management  has  no  financial  incentive  to innovate,  to  adopt  new  plant  and  methods.  Management  has  no  material advantage to overcome short-term problems (including labour displacement) and  the  rising  initial  costs  of  introducing  new  technology.  As  there  is  no foreign  competition,  industrial  ministries  act  as  monopolists  and  retain obsolete plant, this leads to lower output at a higher price than is economically justifiable and technical progress in the economy as a whole is retarded. A further obstacle in the USSR is that capital has no market price and the labour market is imperfect. The price mechanism is not a constraint on firms either to shed labour or to scrap equipment. Rule-of-thumb methods and administrative means are utilized to direct investment. Mistakes at the highest  level  over  the  distribution  of  investment  may  be  a  cause  of  low productivity as well as the economic and political environment in which the economy  operates.  These  underlying  factors  act  as  structural  limits  to possible increases in labour productivity and are the subject of macroeconomic reform. Here we may turn to consider procedures within the given constraints of planning which may influence labour productivity.

While the goal of raising productivity is an agreed objective, the measures to be taken to achieve this goal are matters of controversy. Even in advanced capitalist firms, the quantification of the causes of productivity differentials is  at  an  elemental  level. 21 One  may  distinguish  between  the  underlying factors  promoting  the  'quality'  of  labour  and  the  organizational  methods intended to translate  labour  potential  into  work.  Most  policy-makers  focus on the latter as these are amenable to political decision and should have an immediate positive effect.

## The Quality of the Labour Force

The  efficiency  of  a  labour  force  will  vary  according  to  its  'quality'  and composition. It is widely accepted that age, industrial experience, sex, skill and  education  have  direct  effects  on  productivity. 22 As  Pratten  has  put  it, 'Tradition, custom and education may affect the motivation and performance of managers and workers and so differences in labour productivity can only be fully explained by studying the development of firms and the environment in which firms and their employees have operated over a period of many years.' 23

In  a  speech  on  the  intensive  development  of  the  economy,  Gorbachev pointed  out  that  'Present-day  production,  with  its  complicated  and  costly equipment,  and  the  nature  of  labour  are  making  incomparably  higher demands on everything that is known as the human factor in the economy: the cultural and technical level, vocational skills, creativity and the discipline of  personnel.  Without  this,  neither  labour  productivity  nor  output  quality may be raised.' 24 In  the USSR, interwar industrialization was characterized by  a  quantitative  growth  of  the  urban  working  class.  The  peasant  stock constituted a poorly educated and inexperienced industrial working class.

The urban immigrants from the countryside possessed a relatively low level of general education, the work skills they acquire usually result from rote learning and experience, not from instruction and knowledge. Among such workers the habit of team work under the conditions of the rhythms enforced by machinery are formed most slowly and consequently they have greater difficulty in mastering  the  habits  of  conscious  production  and  labour  discipline  within  the  framework  of  an industrial organisation. 25

In  western  societies  a  universal  culture  of  literacy,  numeracy,  discipline and  punctuality  is  taken  for  granted.  Learning  new  skills  associated  with technical  change  presents  difficulties  in  western  industrial  countries  but advances are facilitated by a high general level of education and culture. In 1951, for instance, Britain had more than two-thirds of its male labour force with nine or more years of schooling, and in the United States in 1957,57 per cent of this group had ten or more years of formal education. 26 In the Soviet Union, at the beginning of the 1970s, only half of the workforce had seven or more years of schooling and even by the beginning of the 1980s, the figure had only risen to three-quarters. In 1979, as recorded in the census, only 39.2 per cent of manual workers had a full secondary education or more. 27

While  the  massive  migrations  of  the  early  period  of  industrialization slowed down in the post-Second World War period, even in the 1960s, 60 per  cent  of  the  increase  in  the  urban  population  was  made  up  of  rural immigrants,  the  figure  falling  only  to  55  per  cent  in  the  1970s. 28 This migration was greater' in the small towns; in the large ones, especially those with restrictions on residence, 29 the working class was  largely selfgenerating. A common problem in countries experiencing rapid industrialization is the adjustment of peasants to town and factory life. In a study  sponsored  by  the  journal EKO, a professor  of  economics  from Leningrad  is  reported  as  pointing  out  that  enterprises  still,  despite  official restrictions, recruit migrants from agricultural areas who  'bring their unsystematic work habits with them.' 30

Workers  with  pre-industrial  skills  experience  frustration  in  an  urban industrial  setting.  In  the  Soviet  industrial  culture,  work  habits,  discipline, punctuality  and  initiative  are  not  part  of  the byt (way  of  living)  of  certain strata  of  the  working  class.  As  Gordon  and  Nazimova  have  expressed  it: 'Daily experience persuades us that it is precisely this personality element of occupational and production competence that is developing most slowly of all.' 31 The low 'quality' of work habits, noted by Lenin when he pointed out that 'The Russian is a poor worker as compared to the advanced nations', 32 is a legacy inherited by many in the contemporary workforce. Productivity is kept  below  a  level  attainable  with  the  equipment  available  because  of  the low quality of labour input. As Gorbachev has pointed out, 'Unconscientious work by a person in the sphere of production or services at any workplace . .

. hinders not only the interests of society but also the worker's own interests in the form of poor-quality goods and services.' 33

A survey of 10,150 people aged over 18 years on the Soviet way of life conducted in eight different Union republics in the early 1980s, found that 98 per cent of the respondents considered 'industriousness and a conscientious  attitude  towards  labour  to  be  the  most  important  factors  in achieving success and well-being in life.' In practice, however, the researchers  found  that  those  with  a  'high  level  of  self-discipline'  and  a 'creative' attitude towards their duties accounted for only 25-35 per cent of the  sample  who  were  in  employment,  while  some  20  per  cent  had  a  low level,  showing  'little  initiative,  violating  labour  discipline  and  frequently failing to meet plan assignments'. 34

The quality of labour input is lower in the Russian areas of the USSR than in some other republics. Industrial labour productivity is higher in Latvia and Estonia than the USSR average. 35 In these republics, the level of equipment, education and vocational training is similar to the USSR average, yet labour productivity is 10-15 per cent higher.

One may conclude that it is precisely  the  habituation  of  personnel  of  this  region,  due  to  actual historical circumstances, to high accuracy and care in their work that is the principal reason for high  efficiency  of  their  labour.  .  .  .  Shaping  of  the  traits  of  personality  corresponding  to  the requirements  of  highly  developed  industrial  production  is  becoming  one  of  the  most  important tasks of the social and cultural policy of the Communist Party. 36

Type  and  duration  of  education  affect  the  level  of  skill,  motivation  and adaptability  of  the  workforce.  As  early  as  1924,  the  economic  returns  to education  were  noted  by  Strumilin,  who  calculated  that  for  every  rouble spent  on  primary  and  secondary  education,  the  national  income  would increase sixfold. 37 But educational systems have a tendency to replicate past rather than new knowledge, and in such cases education does not fulfil its potential contribution towards productivity. The length of time in education is  generally  regarded  as  being  a  reliable,  though  imperfect,  index  of  the capability  of  the  workforce.  A  better  qualified  workforce  is  able  to  learn about,  cope  with,  and  use  the  most  efficient  technically-based  production practices. Also, in periods of rapid change, the better the educational level of the  workforce, the more able it is to respond to innovation and to take up different work.  The amount  of 'effort' put into work  is an obvious determinant of output, but it is notoriously difficult to measure. The pace of

work  and  attention  of  the  employee  to  detail  is  influenced  by  the  general level  of  culture,  by  the  subjective  preference  given  to  work  as  opposed  to leisure, by the role of work in bestowing status through earnings, and by the managerial techniques employed to ensure a constant flow of materials and high tempo of operation. Education, experience and cultural background go to make up labour power or the potential of labour; management and work organization turn that potential into actual work.

General educational standards have undoubtedly risen in recent decades in the  USSR.  The  proportion  of  manual  workers  having  more  than  primary education  rose  from  401  per  1000  in  1959,  to  760  in  1979  and  to  825  in 1984; the comparable figures for non-manual employees are 911, 982 and 987; and for collective farmers 226, 593 and 695. 38 Though I shall mention some reservations  below,  these  advances  in  educational  levels  have  led  to improvements in productivity. Zhamin pointed out in 1969 that workers who have nine or ten years of education master new techniques twice as quickly as  those  with  six  or  seven  years. 39 Other  studies  have  demonstrated  that workers with higher grades of general education take less time to master new types of work, and show more initiative; they also work more efficiently, as witnessed by the fact that they make less waste and have fewer breakages. 40

While the effects on productivity of longer education have been positive, some negative influences may be detected. Workers may underutilize their qualifications by being 'underemployed' on routine work or on jobs which do not  require  such  education. 41 Thus  a  dissatisfied  stratum  of  workers  arises who  move  from  one  job  to  another. 42 The  level  of  general  education  has risen  but  the  vocational  aspects  have  been  neglected.  There  has  been  a tendency  for  students  in  the  general  secondary  schools  to  aspire  to  nonmanual work and for skilled manual jobs to be rejected. 43 Up  to  the  mid1980s, some one third of school-leavers had no vocational training and they lacked knowledge of, and motivation for, the world of work. The educational reforms  in  the  'Guidelines  for  the  Reform  of  the  General  and  V ocational School ' adopted in April 1984 attempt to improve the quality of schooling and to make it more appropriate to the world of work. In 1984, the numbers of  pupils  admitted  to  PTUs 44 for  the  first  time  since  1977  exceeded  the number of planned places. In that year a quarter of all pupils leaving school after eight years' education started work. 45 The problem with the provision

of  'vocational'  education  is  that  the  skills  required  in  a  growing  economy often change more quickly than the educational system.

What one may unequivocally conclude is that whatever political regime currently ruled the USSR, the quality of labour is more comparable to Italy or southern Europe countries than to the USA or north-west Europe. For this reason, whatever organization of production is introduced in the USSR, one might  confidently  expect  labour  productivity  to  be  lower  than  in  the advanced capitalist countries. Improvements in the educational level, training  and  experience  of  the  working  class  should  provide  the  basis  for rises in productivity.

## The Tempo of Work Activity

In addition to the suitability and type of a worker's education, productivity is determined by the motivation and intensity of activity of the employee. This can be illustrated by considering western economies.

Accepted  levels  of  overmanning  to  maintain  output  given  irregular material supply, high numbers of 'indirect' employees (canteen staff, welfare workers, office staft), and restrictive practices by unions have been shown to lead  to  lower  productivity  in  Britain  compared  to  the  USA-as  have  the lower levels of 'control' exercised by management. 46 It is widely recognized that  a  'reserve'  of  labour  in  the  sense  of  a  surplus  of  people  seeking occupations  over  the  supply  of  jobs  available  provides  a  positive  spur  to labour  effort.  A  conscientious  attitude  to  work  is  widely  believed  to  be ensured  by  the  fear  of  dismissal  and  unemployment.  A  psychological atmosphere  is  created  which  is  much  wider  than  the  experience  of  the relatively small number of workers who at any one time are faced with the loss of work  and  their  livelihood.  A  full  employment/labour  shortage economy  makes  labour  'discipline'  difficult  to  enforce.  Workers  who  lack conscientiousness  at  work  are  able  to  procure  other  work  if  sacked  and management  is  loath  to  exert  sanctions  for  fear  of  losing  workers.  It  is argued by critics that a 'systemic' effect of a labour shortage economy is to create  a  psychological  atmosphere  which  encourages  slackness  in  general, and a low intensity of work in particular. Kornai points to absolute labour

security  as  promoting  irresponsibility  at  the  place  of  work  by  anybody susceptible to it- the diligent suffer and the careless and lazy gain. 47

In the USSR, the extent of production deficits resulting from unproductive working  time  may  be  gauged  by  the  fact  that  the  loss  of  one  per  cent  of worktime in industry  can  lead  to  a  shortfall  of  output  to  the  extent  of  6.5 milliard roubles. 48 A survey of 10,150 people conducted in the early 1980s found  that  only  25  per  cent  of  the  employees  claimed  that  they  were adequately  supplied  with  equipment  and  the  necessary  materials,  58.4  per cent regarded supply as 'fair', and one sixth considered supply to be poor. 49 The actual loss of labour time and its economic cost is extremely difficult to estimate.  S.  D.  Reznik,  writing  in Ekonomika stroitel'stva , 50 points  that  in four building trusts studied the loss of working time due to the 'violation of labour discipline'  as  a  percentage  of  all  time  lost  was  11.5,  15.9,  17.4  and 31.5 per cent. In house building, another study found that over a four-month period losses of working time came to 1086 days: 48.4 per cent of the lost time was caused by defaulting of subcontractors, 8.2 per cent by delays in deliveries,  6.2  per  cent  by  lack  of  essential  machinery  and  equipment,  7.2 per cent by the incompetence of foremen and inadequate technical preparation, and only 3.5 per cent by violations of labour discipline. 51 Other authors stress that the magnitude of losses of worktime caused by absenteeism and innershift losses is difficult to estimate, since they are often underreported. Kostin estimates that 'inner-shift' losses amount to 8-12 per cent of worktime, though official figures only register 0.1-0.3 per cent. 52 An editorial in Izvestiya in 1985 reported that at numerous enterprises intrashift idle  time  takes  up  at  least  10  per  cent  of  total  time.  Reducing  it  by  half would  raise  labour  productivity  by  4-5  per  cent. 53 Bernd  Knabe  refers  to Soviet  estimates  that  loss  of  time  is  equal  to  15-20  per  cent  of  total worktime. In addition, on average 15 days a year are lost due to illness, and another  five  days  to  administratively  sanctioned  leave. 54 Absences  for shopping and similar activities have been reported to average 1.6 hours per day and to affect 30 per cent of workers. 55

E.A.  Kyuregyan  surveyed  some  4000  workers  at  ten  representative industrial  enterprises  in  Erevan  in  1979-81  on  their  attitudes  to  work  and level  of  discipline.  He  found  that  29  per  cent  of  the  correspondents  had broken labour discipline, 4.6 per cent had not fulfilled the plan, and 44.4 per cent had produced  low  quality products (presumably  products below

technical specifications). 56 Such losses of labour time and infringements of discipline  are  recognized  by  Soviet  economists  and  sociologists  to  be associated  with  inefficiency  of  the  technical  organization  of  the  work process  (availability  of  materials;  efficiently  working  machinery)  and  are defined  as  the  'objective'  conditions.  Kyuregyan's  research  found  that  the greatest  number  of  breaches  of  labour  discipline  had  their  roots  in  the breakdown of equipment and insufficient and untimely supply of materials and tools. This was followed by poor organization of labour, and the absence of  skilled  help,  low  levels  of  knowledge  and  production  experience  of workers,  lack  of  interest  in  carrying  out  the  task  and  the  loss  of  time  in changing to other jobs. 57 Kyuregyan points out that the enterprises used outof-date  and  worn  machinery  which  was  subject  to  breakdown,  and  the technical  organization  of  the  enterprise  (including  supply)  was  responsible for most of the poor work and was an underlying cause of ill-discipline.

Other  Soviet  statistics  are  available  on  idle  time  in  the  machine  tools industries. Staff shortage was one of the most important causes of time loss, ranging from 16.1 per cent of all time lost in casting equipment to 26.3 per cent in metal-cutting. Planned repair and modernization accounted for 15.1 percent of lost-time in metal-cutting and 26.5 per cent in casting equipment. Out of order ( neispravnost' and unplanned repair of equipment ranged from 10.9  to  15.8  per  cent. 58 'Absenteeism'  ( proguly )  accounted  for  a  relatively tiny  proportion  of  idleness:  0.1  per  cent  in  the  forge  and  presswork  and casting equipment, and 0.2 per cent in metal-cutting and welding machines. Illness,  however, is an important cause of absenteeism, accounting for 'the vast majority of working-time losses in many branches'. Conditions of work are  often  bad,  with  high  levels  of  dust,  gas,  noise  and  poor  lighting. 59 Legitimate absence for illness is as much as three times that of absenteeism. 60

As far as intrashift losses are concerned, Soviet studies show that out of order and unplanned repair of machines ranged from 14 per cent to 26.1 per cent  of  time  lost,  setting  machines  from  13.5  to  22.7  per  cent,  lack  of materials,  parts,  etc.  from  17.9  to  22.1  per  cent.  Delays  attributable  to workers' ill-discipline was small: 1.1 per cent of time lost in forge and press work,  1.8  per  cent  in  metal-cutting,  1.9  per  cent  in  electronic  information machinery,  2.3  per  cent  in  casting  equipment.  These  data  may  conceal shortfalls caused by indiscipline and absenteeism, as such causes may reflect badly on management 61  and may be under-reported.

## The Campaign for Labour Discipline

While  these  quantitative  studies  suggest  that  indiscipline  is  not  the  most important  problem  as  far  as  labour  productivity  is  concerned,  popular indignation in the Soviet press focuses on such pathologies. 62 Many letters have  been  published  decrying  the  prevalence  and  anti-social  nature  of  illdisciplined workers. 'Violating labour discipline' is a phrase which is applied to almost any activity which may reduce output-particularly individual acts of drunkenness, poor time-keeping and absence, idling on the job, carelessness, and  poor  performance  in  general. Literaturnaya gazeta's correspondent,  G.  Popov, 63 writes:  'There  can  be  no  doubt  that  labour discipline and production discipline play an enormous role in everyday life. The economic welfare of the country as a whole and of each of us depends . . .  on labour, production, and executive discipline.' The following are typical of  letters  published:  the  struggle  against  idlers,  shirkers,  drunkards  is  our task.  Who  should  punish  a  violator  of  discipline?  We  should.  .  .  .  At  the factory where I used to work, the practice of 'hidden idling' was common. . . .  Do  you  know  of  cases  when  violators  of  discipline  are  punished  on  the request  of  their  comrades  at  work?  They  are  rare.  .  .  .  It  is  good  that [management]  considers  the  labour  shortage.  But  it  is  not  a  matter  of indifference to us workers whom we work with. Shirkers mean that plans are not  fulfilled,  that  the  collective  will  pay.  We  should  not  let  individuals speculate on the fact that there are not enough workers. The power of the collective  is  great.  The  boss  and  foreman  of  a  workshop  can  be  told  that workers  will  not  put  up  with  a  good  for  nothing.  Moral  and  materials pressure can be used but a conscientious work attitude cannot be cultivated unless the life of an idler or drunkard is made unbearable. 64

## A foreman wrote as follows:

This  is  what  happened  a  few  weeks  before  New  Year  at  our  factory. Seventeen  people  wrote  two  identical  letters-one  to  the  factory  manager and the other to the chairman of the trade union committee. The substance of the letters was:

'Dismiss Comrade X, he spoils our collective'.

There followed a stormy session of the factory trade union committee. One after  another  workers  and  engineers  stood  up  and  accused  this  worker  of arriving late at work,  taking  long  lunch  breaks,  taking  no  notice  of reprimands, constantly doing defective work. . . . In the end the worker was transferred to another section but still remained at the factory. . . . It must be said that our factory [is most efficient]. . . . Why shouldn't we rid ourselves of  [a  slacker]  once  and  for  all?  .  .  .  Many  laws  and  regulations  today  are orientated not so much towards a struggle against violators of discipline as towards  their  protectors.  It  seems  that  the  egoistic  good-for-nothing  is sometimes in a better position than the administration of the factory and the collective. . . .

Many workers would behave differently, would work as they should, if they did not know that there was no unemployment in our country. Almost every enterprise needs workers. If a worker leaves one enterprise he will be taken on by the neighbouring factory. He can dictate his own conditions. And the shop foreman has to hold his tongue, be patient. . . 65

A  lawyer  correspondent  commented:  I  sympathize  with  the  author  of  the above letter and others who insist on the stepping-up of the campaign against violators  of  labour  discipline.  .  .  .  But  there  is  a  paradox  here.  .  .  .  Many leaders  who  demand  new  measures  in  practice  do  not  apply  the  existing measures . . . We should campaign for better labour discipline strictly within the boundaries of law. Research shows that there is a direct link between the number of cases of indiscipline permitted by the administration and the level of discipline among workers and employees. 66

Impressionistic study of the Soviet press leads one to believe that labour indiscipline is thought to be rife. This view is substantiated by a survey of 500  readers  of  the  journal Ekonomika  i  organizatsiya  promyshlennogo proizvodstva and  300  participants  in  seminars  in  the  Siberian  areas  of  the USSR. 67  In answer to the question, 'Have any changes occurred-for better or for worse-in the state of labour discipline during your working career?, B.P.  Kutyrev,  reported:  'Most  respondents  expressed  the  view  that  labour discipline must be steadily improved and that its present level is too low to satisfy  the  constantly  growing  demands  of  production  and  of  society.' 68 A study of the themes  on  the topic of labour discipline in Leningrad newspapers, analysed between 1982 and 1984, found that 45 per cent of the

publications  concerned  punishments  for  disciplinary  offences  and  73  per cent were on education measures to strengthen discipline. 69

In the late 1970s and particularly in early 1980s with the administration of Yuri  Andropov,  campaigns  were  instituted to tighten up and  enforce measures  against  slack  labour  discipline.  These  have  been  carried  on  by Gorbachev.  The  Central  Committee  called  for  a  'more  resolute  struggle against  all  violations  of  Party,  state,  and  labour  discipline',  and  the  Soviet press called for a less lenient attitude towards  ill-discipline. 'Labour discipline'  refers  not  just  to  the  observation  of  the  rules  of  internal  work order  but  also  to  a  'conscientious,  creative  attitude  to  work,  high-quality work, and productive use of work time'. 70 Many resolutions were passed and measures were taken to strengthen discipline in the workforce. 71 The main thrust of the drive to improve labour discipline is directed at reducing loss of worktime incurred through absenteeism-i.e. days lost through late arrivals and  early  departures  from  work;  another  target  is  'intra-shift' loss of worktime  in  the  form  of  idling,  drinking,  playing.  But  'discipline'  equally applies  to  the  administration  which  is  required  to  provide  the  necessary 'organizational and economic conditions for normal highly productive work', the  supply  of  machinery  and  materials  should  promote  'rhythmic'  (i.e. uninterrupted) work. 72 The administration is not allowed to distract workers from  these  tasks  and  to  transfer  them  to  carry  out  'anything  unconnected with production activity'. 73

The major legal enactments may be adumbrated here. In December 1979, a law 74 was enacted which decreed that workers who leave a job twice in the same  year  for  no  good  reason  lose  their  continuous  labour  entitlement ( stazh ). Absentees  and  those  found  drunk  at  work  lose  their  holiday entitlement  gained  for  uninterrupted  work.  Workers  guilty  of  malicious infractions  of  labour  discipline  lose  their  rights  to  holidays  at  enterprise sanatoria and rest homes. They also lose their place in the housing queue.

In  January  1983,  the Andropov leadership put into effect a campaign to combat  absenteeism  by  administrative  means.  'Raids'  were  carried  out  in public places and malingerers were flushed out. 75 Such  activity  performed by  the  police  and  volunteers  is  spasmodic.  Typical  of  such  'raids'  is  the following,  which  happened  prior  to  the Andropov  campaign  in  Frunze  in January  1982. 76 The  'raiders'  were  made  up  of  members  of  the  People's Control  Committee  of  the  Republican  State  Committee  on  Labour,  the

newspaper Sovetskaya  Kirgiziya and  its local correspondents.  In  their inquiries they visited 15 enterprises and found that the 'main reason' for poor time-keeping was 'an indulgent, liberal attitude towards violators of labour discipline. As a rule no action at all is taken against them. Some places do not even keep records on them.' 77 At one factory they found that within shift, equipment downtime and breakdowns led to losses of 17 per cent of working time, one-third of which  is accounted  for by management-authorized absences.

On 7 August 1983 a comprehensive resolution on labour discipline was passed. 78 I shall summarize the 'negative' sanctions, and later I shall tum to the  ways  that  positive  administrative  encouragement  is  proposed.  For  all workers and employees absent without a valid reason, 'their regular vacation time for that year is to be reduced by the number of days they are absenthowever, the vacation must not be less than two working weeks'. For those absent

for  more  than  three  hours  during  a  weekday  without  valid  reason,  the  same  sanctions  are  to  be applied as those established for absenteeism; workers and employees who commit violations of labour  discipline,  are  absent  without  a  valid  reason  or  who  show  up  for  work  in  a  state  of intoxication may be transferred to another, lower-paying job for a period of up to three months or moved to another, lower-level position for the same period. A person is not to be released at his own request  during  this  period,  and  the  time  spent  on  jobs  to  which  manual  workers  or  office employees have been transferred for violating labour discipline does not count towards the period of giving notice; workers and office employees who are dismissed for the systematic violation of labour discipline, for absenteeism without a valid reason or for showing up for work in a state of intoxication are to be paid half the regular bonus rate for the first six months at their new places of work. . .  .  It  has  been  deemed  advisable  to  increase  the  material  liability  of  workers  and  office employees  for  damage  they  cause  to  enterprises, organizations or institutions during the performance of their labour obligations, including liability for the production of defective output.

(The worker is required to pay for damage so done, to a maximum of a third of his or her salary). Workers may be sacked on turning up for work drunk.

These  are  the  main  lines  of  legislation  and  policy  which  have  been continued by Gorbachev. In his election speech, reported on 1 March 1984, he  took  up  many  of  the  points  made  by  Andropov  in  calling  for  greater labour  discipline,  responsibility,  exactingness  and  improvements  in  'style and  methods  of  work'. 79 Enhanced  standards  of  socialist  legality,  and  the cessation of embezzlement, parasitism, hooliganism (i.e. general misbehaviour including drunkeness) and various forms of cheating

('padding' of reports) are the thrust of the leadership's thinking in creating the right  style  of  work.  Social  justice  also  has  a  role  to  play  in  improving incentive to work; unearned or unjustly earned income militates against the principle  of  remuneration  in  accordance  with  the  quality  and  quantity  of work. 80 The  attitudes  of  management also require a significant shift in the direction  of  greater  'thriftiness',  with  more  emphasis  on  economizing  time and materials; management has to be more 'responsible' and should accept its obligations to combat mismanagement and wastefulness. 81

Such suppression of individual manifestations of ill-discipline (the 'subjective'  element)  have  to  be  seen  in  the  context  of  poor  conditions  at work, of mismanagement and of the insufficient or poor training of workers. While  reducing  infractions  of  labour  discipline  will  undoubtedly  lead  to improvements  in  morale  and  increases  in  labour  productivity,  indiscipline itself should be analysed as consequences of the operation of the economy (the 'objective' position). Penal sanctions can only have a limited effect.

## Managerial and Systemic Causes of Poor Labour Discipline

L. Kostin, M. Sonin, T.I. Zaslavskaya and many others have emphasized the structural  and  managerial  constraints  which  predispose  workers  to  bad habits. The full-employment, labour-shortage economy makes it difficult for enterprises to enforce penalties. As Sonin pointed out: The administration of enterprises  and  institutions  is  frequently  compelled  to  hire  new  personnel and close its eyes to their moral and professional shortcomings. To a certain degree the dismissal of a careless or insufficiently skilled worker may even run  counter  to  the  direct  interests  of  the  enterprise  (better  to  have  a  bad worker than no worker at all). Those who violate labour discipline, including chronic  absentees,  do  not  fear  the  gravest  consequence-dismissal-since the only threat is transfer to another, frequently better paid job. Any manager will  unquestionably  think  twice  before  instituting  strict  discipline  for  fear that his workers will begin looking for a job where the rules are not as strict. Much loss of worktime is also due to administratively authorised leave. 82

The survey conducted by Kutyrev 83  gives instances of the strength of the position of workers. The editor of the Metallurgiya publishing house wrote: 'It  used  to  be  possible  to  sack  or  to  transfer  a  person  who  was  working poorly, but now such a decision is costly: you have to find someone new and train  him,  and  your  work  unit  will  suffer.  Just  try  to  find  an  excavator operator today! One has to "think three times" before you take such a step. This is where the harmful liberalism one encounters comes from.'

The  legal  safeguards  to  workers'  employment  also  hinder  management from  taking  action  against  mischief-makers.  A  foreman  at  the  Noril'sk mining  and  metallurgical combine  pointed  out  that 'complaints about decisions  regarding  violations  of  labour  discipline  are  taken  seriously  [by unconscientious workers]; therefore, even when  they  are guilty of a violation,  they  will  file  complaints  with  officials  at  all  levels.  Repeated efforts to check out such problems may confirm management's view, but at a considerable cost in time and nervous tension.' 84

Less  than  a  third  of  the  correspondents  in  the  survey  conducted  by Kutyrev considered weak laws to be a cause of labour discipline. Two-thirds of  people  polled  thought  that  poor  labour  discipline  was  a  consequence  of the acute labour shortage: 'You can't make proper demands on an employee these  days:  if  you  sack  him,  he'll  find  another  job  that's  just  as  good.  .  .  . Employers consider it better to have a poor worker than none at all.' 85

Managerial  and  systemic  insufficiencies  are  considered  by  most  Soviet specialists on labour to be much more important determinants of labour illdiscipline than individual behaviour. But Soviet press coverage emphasizes the 'subjective' factor at the cost of objective ones, In Karpov's study of the Leningrad press (1982-84), only 25 per cent of themes on labour discipline were on the improvement of the organization of production, 16 per cent on enhancing  the  interests  of  workers  and  11  per  cent  more  on  widening  the participation of workers in administration of production. 86

The lack of a clear relationship between worker incentive, effort, output and  wages  is  crucial.  In  the  discussion  of  the  survey  noted  above, A.  Ye. Gazaryan of Gomel University pointed out that with the existing ceilings and floors on wages, incentives are not effective. 'A machine-tool operator who is  ten  times  more  disciplined  and  conscientious  than  a  fellow  worker  with the same job receives only slightly more money and sometimes he even gets the  same.'  Another  contributor  argued  'only  amateurish  efforts  have  been made to structure the incentive system in such a way as to increase worker

motivation, let alone harness it. ,87 Inadequate service arrangements necessitating  queuing  (waiting  for  transport,  meals,  consumer  goods  etc.) leads to short-time working (leaving early, absenteeism). The major deficiencies mentioned in this survey are: inadequate incentives for conserving labour, underemphasis  on final results, the slow pace of equipment  renovation,  shortcomings  in  the  organization  of  production, labour and administration, failure to observe the plan and imperfections in the management mechanism. Three-quarters of the correspondents felt that it was  outside  the  power  of  enterprises  to  enforce  discipline.  They  lacked control over the shortage of labour, breakdowns in the supply of materials were outside their control, and they had insufficient powers to reward good workers and penalise shirkers. 88 Kutyrev concludes that it is the 'economic mechanism'  which  is  at  the  root  of  poor  labour  discipline. 89 Zaslavskaya cites a sociological study claiming that 90 per cent of executives and 84 per cent of workers believe that under different economic conditions they could work  with  significantly  greater  efficiency. 90 These  include  having  greater independence  and  initiative  and  making  income  depend  on  the  quality  of work.

Dissatisfaction  with  work  by  young  workers  is  another  cause  of  illdiscipline. The main offenders appear to be young (under 30) workers and male. This age group also has the highest turnover rate. It is suggested that violations of discipline committed by them are a reflection of the frustration felt by young workers when their jobs do not live up to the expectations 91 of a  better  educated  and  demanding  young  workforce.  'Dissatisfaction'  with existing practice may not be a form of labour 'indiscipline' but an indication of  the  inadequacy  of  traditional  management.  It  is  also  the  result  of  bad planning,  since  workers  are  not  always  given  jobs  requiring  the  skills  in which they have been trained.

## Organizational Measures to Improve Labour Productivity

Given the  constraints  discussed  above-size  and  quality  of  the  population stock,  and  the  level  of  capital  investment-planners  attempt  within  the

structure of a command economy to devise means to make labour work more efficiently and effectively.

A common assumption underlying Soviet thinking (as indeed managerial thinking  everywhere)  is  that  the  level  of  effort  of  the  worker  could  and should be increased. Measurement of 'effort' and the determinants of effort are  notoriously  difficult  to  achieve.  It  is  generally  agreed  that  individuals have a map of preferences in which work is substituted for leisure. In the Soviet  Union,  work  is  regarded  as  more  than  an  economic  necessity.  It  is part of a good life. Wages in western society are instrumentalities linked to individual  striving  for  status  and  possessions.  It  is  widely  believed  that Americans work harder than Europeans because status is seen in terms of individual  advancement  measured  in  money. 92 As  noted  earlier,  for  the 'incentive' of wages to be effective they must be related to purchasing power as well as the mentality of the worker. Here indeed one may make parallels between  Soviet  and  British  industry.  Pratten,  in  his  comparative  study  of labour  productivity,  found  that  British  workers,  unlike  Americans,  lacked motivation for money income. 93 The provision of many services 'in kind' (or highly subsidized) in the USSR serves at present to diminish remunerative motivation.

Material incentives, in the form of rewarding individual contribution by monetary payments, is one of the guiding principles of the organization of the  workforce.  This  pre-dates  the  current  leadership  and  goes  back  to  the time of Stalin. Chernenko summed up current policy when he reiterated that the  principle  of  socialism,  which  is  sacred  to  us,  [entails]  from  each according to his ability, to each according to his work. This is the foundation of the social justice that our working class and our people, for the first time in  history,  have  converted  from  dreams  to  living  reality  .  .  .  .  Those  who work  at  top  efficiency  should,  always  and  everyWhere,  be  provided  with tangible advantages in earnings and in the distribution of housing, vacation accommodation and other social benefits. 94

Gorbachev has also emphasized the role of Soviet justice in improving the motive  to  work,  he  has  castigated  unearned  and  unjustly  earned  income which is contrary to payment according to the quality and quantity of work done. 95

The objective of wage policy is to use wages as an incentive for greater effort on the part of the employee and to reward the quality as well as the

quantity  of  labour. At  the  same  time,  to  avoid  inflation,  planners  have  to ensure that wages rise less than productivity. Difficulties arise when planners have to reconcile wages paid with the assumptions (a) that higher levels of skill and qualification should be more highly rewarded; (b) that the provision of incentives for motivation has to affect the labour force as a whole; and (c) that an increase in levels of productivity should rise at rates greater than the increase in wage payments.

In  market  systems,  the  wage  paid  may  reconcile  labour  demand  with supply,  though  there  are,  of  course,  imperfections  caused  by  wage-fixing, and lags in adjustments of wages. Productivity is ensured by unproductive firms  (in  the  last  instance)  being  bankrupted,  and  a  drive  to  improve productivity and to minimize wages is derived from the necessity to remain in  business  at  a  profit.  However  much  the  market  is  modified  in  capitalist states-either by government policy or employees' associations-the influence  of  the  market  is  to  pay  the  minimum  acceptable  wage  to  the smallest workforce compatible with maintaining output over a given period. Capitalist firms are not subject to wage and price controls and rises in wages may be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. (Wages in the public sector are also indirectly linked to market rates.) In socialist economic systems, however, wage-scales, the quantity of material inputs and outputs, and their prices are given to enterprises by superior economic organs. The wage fund is one of these inputs. As noted above, socialist enterprises have a propensity to employ as many workers as possible, to spend the wage fund and  to  make  it  as  large  as  possible.  The  wage  fund  is  relatively  weakly constrained.  In  the  early  1980s,  in  order  to  control  wage  rises,  an  attempt was  made  to  gear  a  one  per  cent  increase  in  labour  productivity  to  wage increases of 0.35 per cent. This was ineffective and the ratio was raised to 0.4 per cent in 1984. 96 Just as in market societies where there is inflationary drift, in planned ones wage increases are not adequately covered by growth of productivity. In the early 1950s, wages in industry increased by 0.23 per cent for every one per cent increase in labour productivity; five years later, the comparable rise for wages was 0.45 per cent, in 1976 to 1983, it was 0.9 per  cent. 97 In  the  tenth  Five  Year  Plan  (1976-1980),  the  increase  in  the growth  of  wages  was  0.69  per  cent  of  the  planned  increase  in  labour productivity,  instead  of  the  planned  0.5  per  cent.  In  some  industries  (coal, meat  and  dairy),  productivity  even  fell,  while  wages  rose;  in  ferrous metallurgy, petroleum, pulp and paper, food and fish, average wages grew

faster than productivity; in building the indices were the same; in machine tools, labour productivity overall grew faster than wages.

In  the  first  years  of  the  eleventh  Five  Year  Plan  (1981-85),  wage  drift continued: in 1981 industry recorded an average increase of labour productivity of 2.7 per cent and an increase of average wages of 2.3 per cent -a  one  per  cent  increase  in  labour  productivity  for  every  0.85  per  cent increase  in  wages,  as  against  0.64  per  cent  defined  by  the  plan. 98 In  1982 wages rose nearly one third more quickly than labour productivity. 99 This is often caused by adjusting production plans downwards without reducing the wage fund. 100 Ministries and industrial associations redistribute plan assignments, making life easier  for  those  who  work  poorly  and  increasing the  burden  on  the  more  efficient  factories. 101 Prices,  however,  do  not respond to shortages and demand cannot be satisfied. The extent of shortages of consumer goods may be gauged by the fact that between 1970 and 1983 the wages fund in the national economy increased by 90 per cent, while trade turnover rose by 81 per cent. 102 In 1984, compared to 1983, the productivity of  labour  in  industry  rose  103.8  per  cent  (in  agriculture  [ obshchestvennoe proizvodstvo ], 103 it  was  101  per  cent,  in  building  103.1  per  cent,  in  rail transport  102  per  cent).  The  average  income  of  manuals  and  non-manuals rose  by  103  per  cent.  In  1984,  productivity  was  0.4  per  cent  higher  than planned. 104

Systemic  labour  shortage  leads  to  enterprises  bidding  up  the  price  of labour. To keep labour in the factory and to prevent the disruptions of labour turnover,  wage  rates  are  adjusted  and  bonuses  are  paid  to  bring  up  wages should  there  be  a  shortfall.  Hence  wage  levels  became  established  not  by rational norms but by 'unwritten rules' about the standard of living a worker should  enjoy. 105 In  the  electrical  equipment  industry  between  1970  and 1980, the incentive fund rose by 76 per cent while labour productivity rose by 58 per cent. In another enterprise the incentive fund rose by 83 per cent while labour productivity increased by 8 per cent. 106 Wage drift may also be observed  with  regard  to  differentials  which  have  narrowed  considerably: between 1976 and 1984 the wages of manual workers grew by an average of 40 roubles per month, whereas those of engineers rose by only 20 roubles. The average pay of engineers, according to one writer, is only 10 per cent more  than  that  of  workers. 107 This  process  is  said  to  reduce  the  material motivation of engineers and to create distortions in the pay scales which no

longer in many instances sufficiently reward levels of skill. 108 The  lack  of consumer  goods  available at market prices in turn reduces financial motivation-as money is only worth what it can buy.

The  essence  of  current  reforms  in  socialist  societies  is  to  stimulate  the labour  force  to  work  harder  and  to  encourage  the  enterprise  to  increase productivity without significantly weakening the planning constraints on the enterprise  noted  above.  One  important  means  to  combat  the  tendency  of wage  'drift'  and  the  lack  of  correlation  between  wages  and  effort  is  the improvement of norms in deciding wage rates.

## Norms

'Norming' or 'norms' ( norma ) refers to the amount of time necessary for the fulfilment of a particular work activity, given the qualifications of a worker and the level of technology. Wages are paid on the basis of such norms. The value of output is then fixed in relation to the norm, and wages are directly linked to the normative net output of labour. Determining norms is similar to time  and  motion  studies  in  the  West.  In  socialist  states,  the  notion  of  the 'socially  necessary'  labour  time  embodied  in  a  product,  derived  from  the Marxist labour theory of value, legitimates this process. It is assumed that there should be a technologically-determined 'norm' for each work process. Such norms determine what workers should receive as a fair reward for their effort, they shape relativities between workers as well as being a measure for the improvement of productivity. (Norms are separate from bonuses which are paid out of profits.) 109 Once norms have been worked out, the size of the wage fund for an enterprise may be determined by the volume of net output. The  wage  fund  should  only  rise  in  proportion  to  achieved  production  and labour productivity growth.

Economists and planners regularly call for the re-examination and setting of norms on 'technically-based' criteria on a branch and inter-branch scale. The objective  here  is  for  a  given  job  to  be  paid  identically  wherever  it  is located  (subject,  of  course,  to  planned  regional  supplements)  rather  than being  determined  by  individual  factory  management  decision.  In  the  ninth Five Year Plan (1971-1975) it is claimed that 1.706 million piece-workers were made redundant as a result of revision of norms. 110 Norms are often set

too low and are regularly overfulfilled from 150 to 200 per cent; 111 in 1981, more than one third of all piece-rate workers in industry fulfilled their output norms  by  110-130  per  cent  and  another  third  by  more  than  130  per  cent. Norms which are fulfilled  qualify  for  a  bonus  of  20  per  cent  of  the  basic wage  rate  even  though  the  norms  may  be  fixed  too  low. 112 Norms  also 'nearly always fail to take into account the equipping of production with new machinery  and.  .  .  the  improvement  in  workers  skills'. 113 To  stop  this practice  many  writers  call  for  a  limit  to  the  overfulfilment  of  norms.  A correspondent  writing  to  the  newspaper Literaturnaya gazeta, summed  up the situation as follows: The loss of work time in industry is great. But on the  other  hand  is  it  normal  that  at  some  enterprises  output  norms  are constantly being overfulfilled by 20-40 per cent without any great strain, and with considerable inner-shift loss of work time? Use of these reserves alone would  give  us  a  huge  number  of  additional  work  hands.  At  present, enterprises have to have hidden reserves to compensate for inadequacies in planning  material-technical  supply,  use  of  workers  and  employees  for agricultural work, construction etc. However, freeing [i.e. making redundancies]and realising manpower  reserves does not improve the financial-economic  position  of  an  enterprise,  on  the  contrary,  it  usually worsens considerably. We must find a way out of this vicious circle. It can be said without doubt that without making enterprises interested economically in  saving  labour,  all  other  measures  will  not  provide  a  solution  to  the problem. 114

Clearly, workers often attempt to negotiate the lowest norms to secure the highest pay for the minimum amount of work. To counter this tendency, the Aksay method  was  introduced  in  1968  in  a  plastics  factory  in  the  Rostov province.  The  object  of  the  scheme  was  to  encourage  workers  to  revise labour norms on their own initiative. It is claimed that at the plastics plant out put rose by 14 per cent per annum between 1972 and 1982, 115  which is three times the average in this branch of industry. The director saw 'norming' as  the  crucial  variable  to  increase  productivity.  He  points  out  that  norms reconcile the interests of the individual, the factory collective and society: 'if norms are set low, the individual worker may be at an advantage-but not society  and  the  collective  ...  if  the  norm  is  high,  the  material  and  moral interest  of  the  individual  is  reduced.' 116 When norms are always overfilled by 130 to 140 per cent, the usual procedure is for a norm-setter ( normirovshchik ) to advise the director to increase the norm. If he does so,

workers become dissatisfied and wages fall, though later they normally rise. There is a constant process of norm-fixing and revisions. The Aksay director, N.  Nagibin,  points  out  that  this  creates  a  bad  psychological  atmosphere. While norms are revised 'from above' when new technology or machinery is introduced, at other times workers initiate increases. The immediate incentive is that the worker is paid on the introduction of the new norms a bonus equal to half of the anticipated saving for a six-month period. When accepted, such increases in productivity lead to a continuous rise in wages. Since  1978,  piece-workers  have  had  a  threefold  increase  in  wages  and productivity has grown six times. Discipline in the factory has improved and labour turnover has declined from 30 per cent to 6 per cent. 117

It  is  recognized, however, that the method has not been widely adopted. Factory  director  Nagibin  concedes  that  disruption  of  supplies  may  lead  to norms (and output) not being fulfilled and thus managers and workers have a common  interest  in  maintaining  hidden  reserves  of  labour  which  can  be called on to maintain sudden bursts of production (storming) and low norms can be grossly exceeded thereby compensating for idle time. In some cases, when the scheme was introduced bonuses have been lowered to exact even greater savings for the factory: this goes against the spirit of the scheme and leads  to  resentment.  But  workers  become  wary  of  initiating  and  accepting the revision of norms, despite initial material incentives of 50 per cent of the value  of  resources  saved.  As  a  weaver  put  it  in  a  letter  to Literaturnaya gazeta : I am weaver. . . and on average a weaver today may manage 26 to 28 looms.  It  would  be  possible  to  do  more,  but  people  don't  want  to.  Why? Because it's not worth it. . . . Let us assume that workers agree to supervise an extra 4 machines. Their pay increases. . . and does so for 8 to 10 months. Then output norms are increased. Wages stay the same as they were before the extra machines were taken on, but the work is more difficult. As a result many people refuse to man more machines. 118

The  system  of  individually-based  norms  has  some  intrinsic  difficulties. Workers  concentrate  on  their  individual  tasks  to  the  detriment  of  the collective  interest.  They  may  show  less  care  for  equipment.  Defining  the correct norms, moreover, is a highly complicated process. The materials and machinery used by workers vary greatly, making it difficult to fix equitable rates. Even when it is possible to ascertain what a worker could reasonably be expected to do, the organization of production often means that norms are not enforced. Lack of supplies, holdups and breakdown of machinery restrict

output  and, if norms  were  strictly  applied, wages  would  fall.  Hence management often resorts to paying bonuses to workers, not as a reward for extra effort but in order to make up the wage to the average level of pay. 119 In the early 1980s, in many industries, bonuses came to the maximum limits of 40-60 per cent of pay; in industry more than 90 per cent of all workers (on piece-rate and time-rate) receive bonus payments. 120 Fixing the wage fund on the basis of 'norms' would also make life more difficult for management whose wages fund would be determined by an 'objective' criterion. Hence there  is  resistance  to  their  introduction  and  adoption.  The  brigade  system, described below, is one way around these problems.

## Conclusions: Productivity in a Low Pay/FullEmployment Economy

The maturation of the Soviet economy in the 1980s has brought in its train not only new economic problems but also a different pattern of needs on the part  of  the  population.  It  is  impossible  to  increase  growth  extensively  by adding to the labour force because the supply of labour cannot be significantly increased. The economy now requires intensive growth entailing an increase in labour productivity. Labour  productivity and motivation to work are systemic properties of a social system which limit the opportunities of the political leadership to raise productivity through its own actions. The Gorbachev administration, however, has inherited an economic system which provides opportunities for labour productivity to rise. From a social point of view, it will benefit from a population which is much better educated and able to adjust to changes in technology. One current cause of low labour productivity is overmanning and there is currently a surplus of employed  labour  to  meet  administrative  inefficiencies.  In  the  short  run, labour  productivity  can  be  improved  by  reducing  the  age  of  retirement  of capital.  This  will  lead  to  shorter  periods  of  machinery  downtime  and  to  a reduction in the number of auxiliary workers. Relatively small improvements in administration also can lead to rises in productivity: these are to do with delivery of materials and  using the workforce  more effectively. Such changes can be achieved without any significant reform of

the existing 'economic mechanism'. The impact of the campaign to increase 'labour discipline' is limited to short-term improvements in labour productivity.  Increased  motivation  to  work  in  the  long  run  is  largely conceived of in material terms-of more appropriate payment 'according to one's work'.

Material  'stimulation'  of  labour  to  achieve  greater  efficiency  has  many implications  for  social  policy.  First,  wage  payments  linked  to  'material incentives' may give rise to socially and politically unacceptable differentials between groups of workers, thereby undermining the principles of distribution  thought  appropriate  for  the  development  of  'mature  socialism'. While reward according to the principle of desert has been a component of policy since the time of Stalin, those of need and equality of consideration are  also  motivating  principles  of  socialism.  Secondly,  the  utilization  of wages as a stimulus will only be effective if payment can be realized through consumption.  This is not just a problem  of adjusting the economic mechanism but involves the development of new and different products with an  appeal  to  the  higher  income  groups.  A  consumer  society  fulfils  a particular pattern of needs: it encourages production to respond to the pattern of demand given by the distribution of income. The consumption needs of the richer groups might be met at the cost of those of the poorer ones. Such a policy is at variance with the political goals and ideological outlook of the Soviet  political  leadership  (or  at  least  with  elements  of  it).  A  consumer society also entails the reconciliation of demand and supply through the use of money, rather than administrative allocation. Thirdly, improving material incentives  involves  not  only  rewarding  those  who  work  efficiently,  but penalizing  workers  who  default. The  organization  of  work  on  the  basis  of efficiency, where for the enterprise marginal cost equals marginal revenue, is likely to involve a reduction in the workforce. Unemployment may follow in the  train  of  a  move  to  an  economy  based  on  maximizing the efficiency of production units and giving priority to consumption needs. Unemployment is not only a consequence of substituting capital for labour but it also acts to discipline  the  labour  force  and  as  a  reservoir  to  meet  changing  industrial requirements for labour (by sector and geographical location). For reasons to be discussed below, it seems unlikely that a western-type labour market will evolve. More likely will be an increase in the number of redundancies which will be handled through labour exchanges with enhanced powers. Individual

security  of  employment  will  be  weakened  in  the  context  of  economic planners maintaining full employment at the macro-level.

## 6 The Process of Redundancy, Displacement or 'Freeing' of the Workforce in Conditions of Labour Shortage

## Occupational and Sectoral Labour Mobility

Western commentators justify levels of unemployment on the grounds that industrial change and economic efficiency require a responsive labour force. The market, it is held, is a regulator. Declining industries shed labour which is absorbed by growing ones. The supply of labour has to respond to demand through retraining and changing jobs. Both Soviet and western writers have said that the Soviet labour market lacks flexibility and that labour mobility is sluggish.  Garnsey   points  out  that  employment  in  manufacturing  has  been 1 greater, and  in  the  service  sector  lower,  than  in  the  West.  A  similar conclusion  has  been  reached  by  E.  Manevich,  who  unfavourably  contrasts shifts between  sectors  of  the  Soviet  economy  with  those  in  capitalist countries.  The immobility of a large number of unskilled manual workers in 2 many areas of production acts as a brake on the rise of labour productivity. At the level of the enterprise when mechanization has occurred, the numbers of  workers  have  only  decreased  marginally.   Study  of  the  occupational 3 structure  of  the  labour  force,  however,  shows  that  considerable  changes  in the structure of employment have taken place in recent years.

Table 6.1 shows the number of workers in different industries in the USSR for certain years between 1940 and 1982. The table shows first, a reduction of  5.3  million  in  the  agricultural  workforce  between  1940  and  1982  and  a concomitant  rise  in  industry,  building  and  transport;  second,  it  shows  the slow  increase  in  the  service  sector  between  1965  and  1982.  Unlike  in

western  capitalist countries, however,  the  proportion  of employees  in industry,

Source:

building  and  transport  has  risen,  albeit  very  modestly  between  1975  and 1982. Agricultural  employment  has  only  fallen  slightly  between  1975  and 1982 (from 22.6 per cent to 20.2 per cent). By contrast, in 1975, the USA agricultural labour force was only 3.8 per cent, the British 2.7 per cent, and Japan, which started its industrialization from a similar base to that of the USSR, reduced its agricultural labour force from 50.1 per cent in 1950 to 12.5 in 1975. These changes refer to annual average levels of employment. Prima facie, and bearing changes in western societies in mind, the general distribution  of  the  Soviet  workforce  would  appear  to  be  changing  less rapidly in the past twenty years: the total workforce in industry, building and transport  increased  from  43  millions  to  61.2  millions  between  1965  and 1982.

It  would appear that workers are retained in positions, even after capital investment takes place. Study of the data in Table 6.1 shows that the ratio of manual workers to the total number of non-manual has remained constant, or has  even  increased  between  1940  and  1982.  Taking  the  total  number  of manuals to the total number of workers the ratio was 1.4:1 in 1940 and 1.4:1 in  1982;  in  industry  the  ratios  were  1.1:1  and  1.2:1  on  the  two  dates respectively.  In industry in the RSFSR the number of manual workers was 4 planned to be reduced from 53.6 per cent in 1981 to 49.7 per cent in 1985a reduction of 0.7 per cent annum, and even in factories which will come onstream in 1981-90, one third of the labour force will be manual workers. 5 Economic  plans usually define the level of labour displacement (or 'freeing' 6 )  at  some  one  per  cent  of  the  workforce  a  year,  whereas  many specialists argue that it should be more like three per cent.  Possibly there 7 are  too  many jobs in the USSR. Are more jobs created than are necessary and are jobs maintained that should be eliminated?

## An Oversupply of Jobs?

Levels of employment are directly related to the supply of jobs. Western and Soviet  economists  agree  that  the  Soviet  economy,  in  a  macro  sense,  is  a labour shortage one. A labour shortage may be said to exist when the number of vacancies is greater than the number of workers presenting themselves for employment; i.e. the effective demand for labour outstrips its supply. This is

illustrated by Figure 6.1. At wage W, N2 is demanded and O N1 is notionally supplied. N1-N2 is the labour shortage. N-N1 represents the level of frictional unemployment, as described above (see Chapter 4).

Figure 6.1 Demand and Supply of labour

A  labour  shortage  can  be  characterized  at  different  levels:  (a)  in  the economy, (b) in industrial sectors and regions, (c) in particular trades or jobs, and  (d)  in  certain  enterprises.  Due  to  imperfections  in  the  labour  market,

shortages at one level may not affect other levels. Conceptualizing 'shortage' is  complicated by considerations of the efficient use of labour, by whether the supply of jobs is artificial and by whether requirements of production can be  met  by  fewer  workers.  The  latter  considerations  are  not  only  technical and managerial ones but are also linked to the training, ability, motivation and culture of the worker or employee.

Estimates  of  'overmanning'  and  'underemployment'  are  fraught  with methodological  problems.  Notions  of  what  is  a  'reasonable'  or  'efficient' work rate  are  not  simply  technological  measures  of  work  output,  but  also involve socially construed beliefs about work norms. Even under capitalism, work rates vary greatly between societies, though management is impelled to increase work effort. How then do Soviet economists justify their assertion that the workforce is 'underemployed'? There is, first, direct evidence of the inefficient use of labour time, and secondly, economic analysis pointing to the inefficient combinations of factors of production and the low productivity of labour.

There is a paucity of detailed statistics showing the extent and nature of the  supposed  shortages:  no  comprehensive  and  regular  surveys  of  job vacancies are published. In total the number of vacancies is approximately two  per  cent. 8 This  is  not  a  particularly  high  figure  as  one  would  expect, with normal turnover and the creation of new jobs, vacancies to be about this proportion, At the macro-level we know that labour demanded by enterprises continually exceeds Gosplan's calculations. In 1971, the planned number of workers was 92.7 million. In practice, employment totalled 94.1 million; in 1975, 101.4 million places were planned and 104.1 million were employed; i.e. plans were exceeded by 1.4 and 2.7 million in the two years respectively.  In 1981, Manevich reiterated the fact that the 'inflation' of the 9 workforce regularly exceeds the plan by 2-2.5 million. 10

Estimates made by central planners at the macro-level of the numbers of jobs in the economy are not coordinated with the number of jobs created by enterprises.  Numbers  of  jobs  are  not  calculated  centrally  for  enterprises which are able to employ the numbers of workers they require, subject to not exceeding  the  wage  fund  (i.e.  the  total  planned  expenditure  on  wages). 11 However,  the  size  of  the  wage  fund  indirectly  regulates  the  size  of  the workforce  and,  since  1980,  ceilings  have  been  set  for  the  total  numbers employed.  Such  limits are enforced by the local councils' executive committees ( ispolkoms ) but their monitoring and enforcement are

ineffective.  In  1983,  it  'frequently  happened  that  union-republic  ministries ratified manpower increases without consulting local organs'. 12 In 1982, onethird  of  enterprises  in  four  production  ministries  of  the  Russian  Republic (RSFSR)  exceeded  the  labour  targets;  and  one  fifth of all industrial enterprises  in  that  republic  employed  more  workers  than  authorized  in  the plan. 13 Local  agencies  of  control  have  no  effective  power  over  ministries and  can  only  petition  them  and  the  organs  of  people's  control.  Reducing bonuses  of  management  (as  a  penalty)  is  counter-productive-it  weakens morale  and  lowers  output.  I.  Malmygin,  in  the  Soviet  planning  journal Planovoe  khozyaystvo , 14 points  out  that  in  industry  the  number  of  jobs regularly  increases  in  the  USSR,  much  more  than  the  number  of  workers available for employment. From this viewpoint, the demand for labour-the creation  of  jobs-is  the  crucial  factor.  The  Soviet  economic  mechanism operates to increase the supply of jobs. Enterprises have no interest to adopt manpower ceilings. Widespread shortages of labour are  reported.  In  1979, 197  industrial  enterprises  were  surveyed:  at  179  there  was  a  shortage  of workers.

Agriculture  is  short  of  skilled  and  semi-skilled  labour. An  article  by  V . Golubev  and  L.  Tyangov  pointed  out  that  in  the  NonBlack-Earth  zone  in 1973 there were 116 farm machinery operatives per 100 machines, by 1980 this ratio had fallen to 104:100. In 1980, 72-3 per cent of farms in Novgorod and  Pskov  provinces  had  less  than  one  machine  operator  per  piece  of equipment. 15 The exodus from rural areas leads to labour shortage and this in turn requires the towns to send workers to the countryside to help with the harvest and  other urgent jobs. The  training of more  skilled workers ( mekhanizatory )  in  rural  areas  does  not  solve  the  problem.  In  the  Amur region, for example,  7000  people  are  trained  yearly, but most  leave agriculture. 16 The  building industry is also short of skilled workers, particularly  bricklayers,  carpenters,  erectors  ( montazhniki ) and  concrete layers. 17 Such building workers have a high turnover as conditions of work and  pay  are  poor.  While  posts  appear  to  be  vacant  throughout  the  USSR, regional imbalances exacerbate the problem.

The Underutilization of Labour

The  present  high  levels  of  labour  utilization  and  the  apparent  shortage  of labour  have  been  interpreted  by  many  commentators,  especially  but  not exclusively in the West, as being indicative of the inefficent use of labour, of underutilization and overmanning and of being a hidden form of unemployment  or  underemployment.  Western  writers  conceive  of  such employment to be deleterious to production and public welfare: 'It contributes to slow and undemanding work rhythms, slack work discipline, low productivity, low average wages, high production costs etc. ... It is one of  the  factors  that  enables  workers  to  husband  their  energies  for  private ventures. It has a adverse impact on work habits and attitudes toward work. And it results in wages being insufficiently linked to performance.' 18 It is not only  western  critics  of socialist societies, however,  who  point  to  the widespread  'overmanning'.  Economists  in  the  USSR  and  other  socialist countries point to the paradox of 'labour deficits' coupled with the abundance of reserves. Such writers would deny that the demographic tendencies noted above (see Chapter 4) are the chief cause of labour shortages, but point to chronic overmanning and uneconomic deployment.

Comparative studies with western countries suggest that for similar types of  production  Soviet  enterprises  are  'overstaffed'.  Myasnikov  and Anan'ev point out that in the Soviet small tools industry there are 30-50 per cent more workers than in comparable enterprises abroad. 19 G. Kulagin has remarked that  in  chemical  plants  bought  from  abroad  more  than  1.5  times  as  many operatives  are  employed,  3.5  times  as  many  engineering,  technical  and administrative staff and eight times as many auxiliaries. 20 Manevich has said that  Soviet  machinery  plants  employ  30-50  per  cent  more  personnel  than similar  factories  in  the  major  capitalist  countries:  Japan  and  the  Federal Republic of Germany require only a quarter to a third as many designers and researchers  to  develop  comparable  new  machinery.  Soviet  factories,  too, have  many  more  'auxiliary'  workers  (repairmen,  toolmakers,  materials handling workers). Manevich argues that they account for 38 per cent of the total number of workers in Soviet machinery plants, but only 11 per cent in American  factories. 21 He  concludes  that  the  causes  of  inadequate  labour resources are the low levels of mechanization and automation. In 1974, 45 million  people  were  engaged  in  unskilled  manual  labour;  this  represented about 44 per cent of employees in industry, 66 per cent in building and 75 per cent in agriculture. Furthermore, he points out, even when laboursaving machinery is introduced, 'excess employees' are maintained on the payroll. 22

(This  may  be  somewhat  misleading,  as  western  factories  are  able  to  scrap and replace parts rather than repair them. American plants also have more machinery for lifting and transfer, whereas in the USSR this has to be done manually.)  Much  of  the  mechanization  of  production  is  haphazard.  In  one automatic production facility, it took 120 workers to operate the machinery and 1500 to do the despatch, packaging, stores and repair work. 23 In  total, about half of all manual labour in the Soviet Union is engaged in auxiliary production. 24 The  economic  effectiveness  of  investment  is  2.8-3.5  times greater in auxiliary than in basic production. 25 Numbers in auxiliary work, however, grow because of the need to repair and service machinery. (Spare parts  have  to  be  made  in  the  users'  workshops.)  In  1979,  there  were  35 million people in repair work and 14 million workers employed in loading and  unloading  (i.e.  22-33  per  cent  of  workers  employed  in  the  various industrial branches).

Seasonal shortages in agriculture have 'knock on' effects in industry. The system of shefstvo or shefskaya pomoshch' involves enterprises helping out with agricultural labour bottlenecks. Kostakov has estimated that some two per  cent  of  all  industrial  personnel  are  maintained  at  enterprises  so  that sponsorship  work  may  be  carried  out. 26 This  leads  to  inefficiency  in industry. A writer to Pravda expressed his frustration as follows: Everyday many tens of thousands of people leave their places of work to do jobs that are inappropriate for them. . . . For the third week now. . . our enterprise's employees have been going out into the radish fields, where the radishes are not even ripe. But no matter what work there is to be done or what we have accomplished,  they  don't  release  us  earlier  than  the  set  time.  Isn't  this absurd? Who is supposed to design new equipment? Who is supposed to put it into production? How much is a bunch of radishes costing the state? 27

A director of a plastic and polymer factory reported that the enterprise had to send 400 people to harvest tomatoes, 120 people per day from November to May to agriculture depots, and 50 workers were engaged on building houses and silos. In eleven months in 1982, it was estimated that in this enterprise alone 90,000 workingdays (7 per cent of total labour time) were lost by such activities.  A  contributor  to Literaturnaya  gazeta estimates  that  about  1.5 million people per month may be absent from their main tasks in order to perform shefstvo activity. This form of activity makes for poor discipline-

workers  do  not  work  properly  at  their  place  of shefstvo and  often  request time off from their home enterprise in lieu of work performed at weekends. 28

To  meet  this  kind  of  labour  demand,  enterprises  hold  on  to  reserves  of manpower to send quotas for agricultural and construction work. This partly explains the large numbers of manual workers retained in industry, described above. Economists such as Manevich and Kostin call for such practices to be dropped, or at least curtailed, since it is uneconomic in the long term. They point  out  that  if  agricultural  labour  were  better  organized,  and  such  work more mechanized, there would be no need to import such large numbers of helpers  from  industry.  Agro-industrial  complexes  or  associations,  it  is suggested,  should  be  created  to  reduce  the  seasonal  fluctuations  in  the employment  levels  for  agriculture. 29 Manevich  points  to  the  instrumental rationality of this process for the factory manager: 'enterprises keep certain reserves  of  workers  to  enable  them  to  send  workers  for  agricultural  work without placing the fulfilment of their own production plan in jeopardy. . . . The recruitment of workers and white-collar workers for agricultural work is not  economically  viable.  As  a  rule,  the  agricultural  output  attributable  to these workers is two times more expensive than that produced by agricultural  workers,  and  their  labour  efficiency  is  four  times  less  than  at their normal workplace.' 30

Overmanning is widespread in the USSR and, moreover, is recognized to be so. Over 1000 people participated in a forum on labour organized by the weekly  Literatumaya  gazeta,  of  whom  80  per  cent  said  that  there  was  no 'real' labour shortage. 31 In the discussion of labour utilization, an economist wrote from Alma Ata that the 'planned' workforce could be reduced by 6.4 per cent and he alleged that generally work for a planned workforce of 100 could  be  done  by  60. 32 A  western  study  conducted  in  1983/84  of  2900 former Soviet citizens fo und that 75 per cent believed that productivity in the USSR was declining and 49 per cent felt that the plan could have been fulfilled  with  5  per  cent  fewer  workers.  (Eleven  per  cent  felt  that  it  could have been completed with 50 per cent fewer employees.) A contributor to the Literatumaya gazeta debate emphasized that inefficiency was due to lack of financial incentives. It was pointed out that many enterprises exceed plans by 30-40 per cent without any strain on the workforce. 33

Production  is  not  carried  out  evenly  throughout  the  month;  rather,  it  is clustered in the last few days. As V. Parfenov has put it: 'if a plant fulfills 6070 per cent of its monthly plan in the last 10 days of the month that means

that the enterprise has a considerably greater number of people than it needs if  work were to be organized at a regular pace . . ." 34 Labour reserves are also necessary to help cope with changes in plan assignments and to be In reserve'  to  help  overcome  bottlenecks  caused  by  irregular  supplies  and breakdowns.

## The Process of Job Creation

There are two main reasons for the excessive number of jobs created, First, the level of new investment is high and creates its own demand for labour. New  capital  investment  is  sanctioned  by  Gosplan  and  is  administered through  the  control  of  local  agencies  of  USSR  Capital  Investments  Bank. They are supposed to 'establish clear-cut criteria for the economic effectiveness of new construction and of expansion, reconstruction and reequipment'. The USSR State Construction Committee and its local agencies have oversight over new construction projects. Though the total amount of investment  is  controlled  by  Gosplan,  investment  and  construction  organs ignore the labour implications of new investment. The Ukrainian Minister of Industrial Construction has pointed out that new construction is required by 'powerful organizations at all levels . . .. Reconstruction is unprofitable for builders . . ..We build mainly new plants.' 35 Second, production enterprises have  little  incentive  to  economize  on  labour.  The  wage  fund  is  given  by higher authority, and the larger this is, the easier it becomes for the enterprise to meet  its  production  targets.  The  essence  of  Soviet  planning  is  the fulfilment  of  production  targets  in  quantitative  terms.  Enterprises  are  not rewarded if their wage fund is not used up. Enterprises (with the exception of some 'experiments' described below) have no financial incentives to 'shed labour'. Sonin has pointed out that authorities at all levels in the enterprise (foremen, shop superintendents and enterprise directors) have a stake in not reducing manpower reserves, but in 'retaining extra workers, saving them for peak  periods  and  for  periodic  assignments  to  agricultural work'. 36 In planning  negotiations,  therefore,  the  need  for  workers  by  enterprises  is inflated.

The  existing  shortages  of  labour  have  a  ratchet  effect:  shortage  creates further  shortage.  New  enterprises  tempt  labour  by  offering  higher  wages.

Managers in practice have some leeway in fixing wages. A writer to EKO describes the process whereby new enterprises inflate their wage funds. Such factories  make claims to their administrative superiors for labour-intensive processes. These they use for non-labour-intensive ones and thus are able to pay wages which are 40-50 roubles greater than other factories. 37

The  numbers  in  the  workforce  are  an  important  determinant  of  the resources  made  available  to  the  enterprise  in  the  economic  plan:  they determine the size of the wage fund, the material incentives fund, the sociocultural and housing construction fund, the bonuses for introduction of new technology, the bonuses for socialist competition, and (in the machine tools and metalworking industries) the salaries of managerial and engineeringtechnical  personnel. 38 The  'brigade'  and  Shchekino  methods studied below are advocated to overcome these problems.

Administrative  controls  are  ineffective  in  reducing  manning  levels.  In 1982 the planned growth of labour resources was reduced by the planners by a third in the RSFSR and by a quarter in Lithuania. However, it was found that  about  a  fifth  of  industrial  enterprises  in  that  year  had  exceeded  their labour  quotas,  yet  the  same  proportion  of  enterprises  had  a  shortage  of trained workers. 39 Labour organs of Goskomtrud and Gosbank USSR have the  right  to  exert  economic  sanctions  against  enterprises  which  exceed  the limit  of  workers'  places. They  may  reduce  the  wage  fund  by  up  to  50  per cent and by up to 50 per cent of the bonus fund for management. In practice, however, such sanctions are only applied when enterprises do not fulfil their plan  for  the  increase  of  labour  productivity.  In  1981,  it  was  reported  that 2000 cases of exceeding labour employment limits were known to the labour authorities  of  the  RSFSR  but  only  in  564  cases  were  material  sanctions applied. 40

Attempts  by  enterprise  managers  to  plan  the  number  of  workplaces through  a  process  of  'certification'  have  been  made.  This  process  tries  to relate  manpower  available  in  a  given  area  to  the  needs  of  the  individual enterprises. The local authority'S planning commission takes over responsibility for checking the manning levels in factories. For instance, in the Voroshilov factory in Dnepropetrovsk, a 'certification' of the number of workplaces  was  reported  in  March  1984:  it  found  that  of  2789  jobs,  528 were only partially necessary and 92 were unnecessary and were eliminated. 41 Such 'experiments', however, have not yet been adopted on a wide-scale level and have met with resistance by managers. 42

The  availability  of  'surplus'  labour  at  enterprises  concurrent  with  an insatiable demand for labour by the enterprise poses the problem of whether the Soviet authorities may improve productivity of labour through redundancy  while  avoiding  mass  unemployment. Answers  to  this  question may be sought at the macro-level with changes in the 'economic mechanism' and the planning process, and at the micro-level in the enterprise and work unit. We shall take up the macro-analysis in the final chapter and outline in this and the next two methods that have been introduced at the workplace: the 'Shchekino experiment' and the work brigade.

## The 'Shchekino Experiment'

Localized  'experiments'  may  be  introduced  in  the  Soviet  Union  without seriously  disturbing  the  institutionalized  patterns  of  control  and  traditional planning procedures. They can be used as instances of what might be called 'good practice' in British government-a model to be emulated by others and on which existing activity may be evaluated. They may be initiated by local political interests (the local party apparatus)  or by  management.  The Shchekino  experiment  takes  its  name  from  the Shchekino  khimkombinat imeni 50-letiya obrazovaniya SSSR 43 in  Thla  which  in  1967  introduced  a number of local reforms aimed at improving labour productivity.

Tula is an urbanized and industrialized province in central Russia. It has a very high labour participation rate-97.4 per cent of the economically active population 44 is either at work or study. The size of the population of the area is declining. Extensive forms of economic development (adding more labour to capital) had to be replaced by intensive ones. From 1966 to 1968-70, the rate of growth of labour productivity fell from 8.8 per cent to 7.2 per cent a year and wage rises were greater than productivity increases. 45 The chemical industry in Tula was an expanding one as mineral fertilizers were in great demand  for  agriculture.  Expansion  of  production,  then,  was  limited  by labour shortages both within existing enterprises and for meeting the needs of newly construct ed ones. In April 1967, representatives of the USSR State Committee on Labour and Wages and the Ministry of the Chemical Industry visit ed the Shchekino chemical fa ctory. 46

Following their visit the Shchekino experimenr 47 was instituted. It sought (a)  to  increase  output  of  an  enterprise  with  a  given  number  of  employees, and (b) to increase output and simultaneously reduce the number of staff. 48 As  P.  Sharov,  the  manager  of  the  enterprise  pointed  out,  the  established planning  procedures  entailed  that  the  larger  number  of  workers  employed, the greater the material incentives fund. The crux of the experiment was to maintain the size of the wage fund while decreasing the number of workers employed;  under  the  routine  form  of  planning,  of  course,  the  number  of workers would entail a fall in the wage fund. The scheme enyisaged that (a) the Shchekino wage fund was to remain unchanged fo r three years (196870), (b) the production plan was to be stable during this period, and (c) the enterprise  had  to  increase  labour  productivity.  The  fixing  of  levels  of production targets together with a constant wage fund meant that improvements in labour efficiency through labour losses would not lead to hikes in targets with a lower wage fund.

The incentive for (c) was that all savings on labour would accrue to the enterprise's funds. Fifty per cent of savings would be the responsibility of the workshop head who could give bonuses to workers for combining jobs or increasing output. Wages could rise by up to 30 per cent of basic pay. The other half of savings made would be controlled by the factory director and could be used as financial incentives for punctuality, to enhance the quality and  quantity  of  production,  and  to  improve  amenities-factory  housing, holiday facilities and so on. 49

A  number  of  suggestions  were  made  as  to  how  productivity  should  be increased.  The  most  important  ways  to  reduce  staff  were  to  combine  jobs ( sovmeshchenie  professii ), to mechanize  labourintensive work, and to 'expand zones of service' ( rasshirenie zon obsluzhivanie ), i.e. to supervise or operate more working units. In addition, other procedures of a technical and administrative kind were advocated: (i) the 'scientific organization of labour' (NOT),  (ii)  introduction  of normatives  for  labour,  (iii) automation  of production processes, (iv) simplification and improvement of the administration  structure,  (v)  centralization  of  auxiliary  services,  and  (vi) provision  oftraining  for  all  categories  of  workers  to  enable  them  to  have knowledge of technological processes involved in production, and to keep up with technical innovations. 50

The immediate results of the experiment were hailed as impressive. The enterprise  manager  reported  that,  in  the  first  two  years,  more  than  1000

workers took on a second or 'mixed' job, more than 4000 workers improved their qualifications, the number of workers was reduced by 870, in two years productivity  increased  by  87  per  cent  and  the  volume  of  output  by  80  per cent. 51 Between  1967  and  1974,  the  volume  of  production  increased  2.5 times and labour productivity by 3.1 times; total personnel employed fell by 1324 and expenditure on wages per rouble of goods produced fell from 13.9 copecks to 5.3 copecks; the average wage increased by 43.1 per cent. Labour discipline also improved, turnover was reduced and fringe benefits were also better. 52 The  destination  of  labour  that  was  shed  will  be  discussed  below; here we may note that the demand for similar types of labour continued in an adjacent newly constructed plant.

The first period of the Shchekino experiment lasted from 1968 to 1972, during this time the method was adopted by 22 enterprises responsible for about  a  third  of  industrial  output  in  the  province. 53 This  period  saw productivity  rising  mainly  through  combining  jobs  and  the  expansion  of 'zones of service'. By 1974 in the 22 factories adopting the methods, 7421 employees were laid off: 5991 manual workers, 1127 engineering technical workers and 160 office ( sluzhashchie )  personnel. This  represented  about  8 per cent of the total number employed in industrial production, 19.4 per cent were laid off at the Shchekino plant, 19.7 per cent at Novomoskovski and 11 per cent at Tulasantekhnika. 54

The  second  stage  of  the  Shchekino  experiment  occurred  between  1972 and  1976.  This  coincided  with  the  spread  of  the  movement  to  other industries and to further developments in the modernization of production, improvements in the management structure, updating technology and better training for the work force. By the end of the ninth Five Year Plan (1975), Parfenov  and  Shvetsov  report  that  some  1000  enterprises  had  adopted  the method  of  which  only  150  were  in  the  chemical  industry;  45,500  manual workers and 10,600 technical and office workers had been made redundant. 55 During  this  stage  the  introduction  of  new  methods  and  the 'freeing' of workers was accompanied by the construction of new combines which were staffed  by  workers  from  the  old  plants. 56 In  the  machine  tool industry,  personnel  cuts  occurred  among  auxiliary  workers,  whereas  at Shchekino production workers were affected. 57

The adoption of the Shchekino method appeared to make a difference to the efficiency and productivity of labour. A study of 326 enterprises between

January  and  October  1975  fo  und  that  91.7  per  cent  of  the  increase  in production was derived from an increase in labour productivity compared to 80. 5 per cent in industry as a whole. 58 The tempo of work and discipline improved  with  the  introduction  of  the  Shchekino  method.  In  the Artemov GRES, turnover fell from 17 per cent in 1973 to 8.7 in 1975. In the Angarsk petrochemical  plant  absenteeism  fell  by  40  per  cent  between  1970  and 1975. 59 At  enterprises  studied  which  had  adopted  the  method,  wages  on average  had  a  7.8  rouble  additional  payment  and  the  average  bonus  for workers was 8 per cent. 60

In  the  second  phase  of  the  experiment,  low-powered  and  antiquated equipment  was  'reconstructed';  technology  and  the  introduction  of  laboursaving  machines  became  of  prime  importance.  A  study  of  the  Shchekino method  adopted  at  the  Perm  Mashinostroenie  factories  found  that  at  one factory  between  1969  and  1972  increases  in  labour  productivity  were derived from the following: mechanization and automation of production (29 per  cent),  perfecting  organization,  adjusting  norms  and  pay  (22  per  cent), introduction  of  new  technology  (20  per  cent),  improvements  in  product design (18 per cent), perfecting administration, combining jobs and widening job content (11 per cent). 61

Taking  the  period  1967-80,  under  the  chemical  and  mineral  fertilizer industries,  83,000  people  were  displaced:  19  per  cent  through  combining jobs,  23  per  cent  as  a  result  of  expanding  'zones  of  service',  17  per  cent through improving the form of administration, 8 per cent from progressive labour  norms,  15  per  cent  were  due  to  transfer  to  the  brigade  form  of organization, 5 per cent resulted from the centralization and specialization of auxiliary services, 12 per cent through the mechanization of labour intensive work; in all, 30 per cent were 'freed' as a result of technical factors and the remainder from organizational-economic measures. 62

The  method  was  adopted in Ministries concerned with motor car production  (23  enterprises),  chemical  and  oil  industry  machine  tools  (46), chemicals (150), tractors  and  agricultural  implements  (l). 63 Others  ignored the  scheme.  Data  given  in  an  overview  article  in Sotsialisticheski  trud showed  that  the  method  had  been  adopted  in  the  paper-making  industry (54.3  per  cent  of  the  enterprises),  chemical  production  (46  per  cent), microbiological  industry  ( glavmikro-bioprom )  (41.7  per  cent),  oil  refining and  petrochemicals  (30.1  per  cent).  These  industries  were  ones  where regulated technological processes occurred and were paid on day rates; here

'technical-organizational measures' are utilized to combine tasks and reduce the number of jobs. In machine tool, coal and light industry workers use one machine and are paid piecework and output is increased by the intensity of machine working and hence the Shchekino method is less useful. 64 In 1981, ministries not adopting  the  method  included:  the  Ministry  of  Energy Machinery, Ministry of Oil Production, Ministry of Gas Production, Ministry of Heavy Machinery Production, and the Mining Industry. 65 Different forms of laboursaving are appropriate for different industries. A survey of eighteen Leningrad factories in different branches of production found that displacement  of  workers  could  be  analysed  into  three  groups.  First,  in machine  tools,  30  per  cent  of  the  'freed'  workers  were  as  a  result  of mechanization  and  automation  of  production  and  only  9.9  per  cent  from combining  jobs  and  widening  the  sphere  of  activity.  Secondly,  in  the chemical  industry,  combining  jobs  and  widening  the  'zone  of  service' accounted  for  41.9  per  cent  of  those  displaced,  and  only  10.1  per  cent  of displacements  were  due  to  mechanization  and  automation  (for  the  third group, metallurgy, no data are given). 66

By 1980, however, the full scheme had been adopted in 2003 production enterprises,  and  7251  enterprises  had  adopted  elements  of  the  method, particularly combining jobs and extending the sphere of operations. 67 It was claimed that such devices in the period of the tenth Five Year Plan had freed 968,000  workers-6  per  cent  of  the  industrial  production  personnel  and 433,000 had been transferred to new workshops to take up vacant posts. 68 In 1980, the freeing of workers led to savings in the wages fund of 287 million roubles. 69

As to redundancies, though no comprehensive statistics are available, the Central Statistical Agency,  surveyed a sample  of factories using the Shchekino  method.  The  results  were  as  follows:  in  the  Ministry  of  Light Metallurgy  15.3  per  cent  of  the  total  employed,  Ministry  of  Chemical Production 10.3 per cent, Ministry of Energy 10.4 per cent, Ministry of Oil Extraction 6.4 per cent and the Ministry of Heavy Metallurgy 6 per cent. 70 In auxiliary  work  (repair,  transport,  packeting,  control)  combining  jobs  and extending job content, reductions in personnel were much lower: Ministry of Oil  Extraction  1.8  per  cent,  Ministry  of  Energy  of  USSR  1.1  percent, Ministry of Paper Production 0.8 per cent, Ministry of Chemical Production 0.7  percent,  at  the  Ministries  of  Heavy  Machinery,  Electrical-Technical

Industry, Leather and Footwear and Fur industries 0.4 per cent, Automobile Production 0.3 per cent and Sewn Goods Industry 0.2 per cent. 71

The  scale  of  laying  off  may  be  gauged  by  a  survey  of  326  industrial enterprises  studied  on  1  November  1975,  which  since  introducing  the experiment had 'freed' 4.5 per cent of their workforce-47,400 personnel. 72 The destinations of the workers so made redundant by changes in the 326 enterprises  studied  were  as  follows:  22.4  per  cent  took  up  jobs  in  new workshops (presumably within the same enterprise) and 52.4 per cent were assigned  to  vacant  positions  in  existing  workshops,  25.2  per  cent  went  to other  enterprises  and  organizations  with  vacancies. 73 At  Shchekino,.  V .M. Suslyak,  the  Secretary  of  the  Tuila  obkom,  points  out  that  the  local  party organization and  the trade union  branches  'were  obliged  to help the leadership  of  the  combine  to  find  work  for  displaced  manual  and  nonmanual  workers'. 74 In  an  overview  article,  V .  Fil'ev  points  out  that  when redundancies are properly planned workers can have a choice of two to three jobs. 75

## Limitations on the Spread of the Method

The experiment was unevenly adopted. By the end of the 1970s, the method was used in full at 1500 enterprises in the USSR and only in part at another 8000. 76 During the whole period of the tenth (1976-80) Five Year Plan, R. Batkaev and S. Semin, estimate that 968,000 people were 'freed' in 11,710 enterprises using the Shchekino method. The growth in productivity at such enterprises  averaged  3.4  per  cent  compared  with  1.5  per  cent  not  on  the system. This was widely regarded in the Soviet press as disappointing. In the second  phase  of  the  scheme,  some  of  the  initial  conditions  were  either changed by the higher authority, or enterprises were unable to implement the method  because  of  regulations  imposed  by  their  ministries.  The  USSR Committee on Labour and Wages in 1973 changed the rules. They forbade the  transfer  of  wage  savings  to  the  material  incentive  fund;  profits  from savings  were  taken  by  the  central  authorities  (from  Shchekino  itself,  4 million  roubles).  The  promised  stable  five-year  wage  fund  and  production targets were not maintained. 77 The authorities found it necessary to change

supply targets. A. Radov, the Pravda correspondent who investigated the fate of the experiment in 1981, reported that if a head of a glavk (administration) had non-ftilfilment of the plan by one enterprise, the targets would have to be  'redistributed' 78 to other  enterprises,  including  those  on  Shchekino. Ministries which started new units in enterprises did not provide them with additional wage funds and thus savings from productivity had to be used to finance the wage outlays for the new units. 79

In the Cherkass chemical plant 'Azot', for instance, the wage fund was set for  the  period  1971-75,  but  adjusted  17  times  during  the  period  of  the experiment. 80 At  the  Shchekino  plant,  after  economizing  on  labour  and saving  on  the  wage  fund,  the  enterprise  found  that  the  wage  fund  for subsequent  years  was  cut.  During  the  ninth  Five Year  Plan  (1971-75),  the fund  lost  3  million  roubles:  This  led  to  a  situation  in  which,  with  the introduction  in  1975  of  new  base  wage  and  salary  rates,  the  combine  was forced by a lack of money to cancel the intended pay increments and rates for 1700 employees. During the past five-year plan, the Shchekino workers' planned  wage  fund  decreased  by  1.3  million  roubles.' 81 Ministries  also required  enterprises  to  reduce  engineering,  technical  and  office  staff,  quite independently of reductions made internally as a result of the introduction of the new methods. 82 These procedures, of course, severely discouraged their introduction. In other enterprises, even when considerable rises in productivity had been achieved, the Ministry discontinued the scheme and in some cases refused the adoption of the method. 83

The introduction of general regulations allowing enterprises to give extra material incentives for work with fewer staff led to enterprises ignoring the need to introduce the Shchekino principle. 84 Ministries and Departments did not  press  the  method,  presumably  because  production  would  be  fixed  for five  years  and  therefore  supply  would  be  inflexible.  As  Academician  A. Aganbegyan  put  it,  when  an  enterprise  has  a  stable  plan  for  a  number  of years,  the  Ministry  loses  room  for  manoeuvre,  complicating  its  own  life. When  one  enterprise  does  not  fulfil  its  plan,  another  one  is  given  an additional assignment and its plan revised upwards.  This completely undermines the Shchekino experiment. The Deputy Minister of the chemical Industry,  K.  Cherednichenko,  asserted  in  March  1977  that  the  instructions sent to enterprises by the central authorities 'gradually reduced the interest of enterprise  collectives  in  introducing  the  Shchekino  method'. 85 Enterprises,

for instance, were required to set labour norms on a branch and inter-branch basis as a condition for introducing the method; yet even in the Shchekino combine  itself  by  1977  only  30  per  cent  of  personnel  were  working  on confirmed norms. Thus, this regulation 'will prevent most enterprises from introducing  the  Shchekino  workers'  experiment  during  the  tenth  Five-Year Plan'. 86 While the regulations formally said that enterprises could independently decide to adopt the experiment, 'other paragraphs indicate that no step can be taken without a higher department's approval'. 87

In  1978,  Goskomtrad,  Gosplan,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  trade unions' organization approved new  regulations on the application of Shchekino.  Such  methods  would  be  introduced  by  management  with  the agreement  of  the  trade  union  committee. 88 While  the  methods  were  not universally put into effect, this decree marks  the acceptance of the Shchekino experiment as part of the system of economic administration. In December 1981, a resolution of the Council of Ministers gave managers the right to give supplementary payments for combining jobs and for expanding zones of service as well as for increases in the volume of work done. 89 This resolution  provides  the  basis  for  increasing  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of labour  under  the  brigade  system. The  resolution  gave  management  greater powers  over  the  distribution  of  material  benefits  and  the  displacement  of workers.  By  the  mid-1980s,  the  following  elements  derived  from  the Shchekino method had been incorporated in the practice of many enterprises:  the  setting  of  stable  wage  normatives,  the  transfer  of  unused savings from the wage fund to the fund for material incentives, the setting of supplementary payments for combining skills, the simultaneous payment of rewards  for  measures  undertaken  to  guarantee  reductions  in  staff,  the planning of basic indicators for the Five Year Plan with divisions for each year.  Until  1981,  these  rights  had  been  given  only  to  enterprises  officially designated as working ' po-shchekinski '. 90 By the early 1980s the scheme had been  revitalized  and  in  1984,  practically  all  enterprises  in  the  chemical industry had adopted the method. 91

Resistance to Change

The reluctance  on  the  part  of  the  Ministries  to  implement  Shchekino  may also be seen to have a political significance: the greater the independence of enterprises, the lesser the need  for ministerial tutelage and  direction. Ministries probably regarded an extension of the method as an infringement of  their  own  rights.  Some  indication  of  this  view  is  the  statement  by  S.Z. Kossoi, the deputy director of the Ryabikov machinery factory in Tula, when he said, 'the  clear,  well-defined  nature  of  the  rights  won  by  the  Shchekino method  is  apparently  not  to  the  liking  of  certain  planning  and  economic agencies . . . '. 92 When the scheme went through difficult periods, the Party again seems to have been the major force in Shchekino for keeping it going. Under the town Party Committee was formed a council composed of Party, Soviet,  Komsomol  workers  and  other  specialists.  J.  Grotseskul,  the  First Secretary  of  the  Shchekino  town  Party  Committee  points  out  that  'due  to lack  of  support  from  the  Ministry  [the  method]  began  to  crumble.  It  was clear that without Party action, the innovation would go no further . .,' 93 The Party was responsible for reviving the scheme in the late 1970s.

The  implications  of  the  Shchekino  method  become  clearer  when  we consider  its  further  developments.  V.V.  Semenov,  the  head  of  the  Tula Province Party Committee advocated that the method be spread 'horizontally' to  other  enterprises  in  the  city.  From  a  labour  utilization  point  of  view,  he argued that it was hardly an economy of labour if, after being displaced from Shchekino, the workers were used inefficiently in other city enterprises. By 1982,  90  per  cent  of  the  city's  industrial  output  was  on  the  Shchekino method and this equilibriated labour supply and demand. The First Secretary of  the  Shchekino  City  Party  Committee  advocated  that  the  system  be extended to a regional basis and he further advocated it be introduced in the Tula province as a whole. 94 If such proposals were  to be adopted, adjustments  between  enterprises  and  labour  supply  problems  would  be determined  locally  and  the  supervisory  powers  of  the  centre  would  be reduced.  By  the  mid-1980s,  the  Shchekino  'experiment'  was  sufficiently adopted for it to be considered no longer at the experimental stage and, as noted  above,  many  of  its  conditions  have  been  generally  adopted. 95 The brigade system (see Chapter 8) in which workers are paid for 'end results' to some extent supersedes the 'Shchekino' method. 96

Opposition  also  came  initially  from  the  workers  at  the  Shchekino  plant and presumably was also a factor when introduced elsewhere. But 'displacement'  involved  by  the  method  does  not  have  the  connotation  of

'redundancy' as in the West. It means for an employee his or her departure from a given production collective and/or his or her movement to a different type  of  work. 97 Such  labour  movement  has  to  be  seen  in  the  context  of enterprises having an obligation to give work to those displaced through the introduction of new technology. 98 It  is  recognized, moreover, that there are conflicts of interest between the individual and society: 'freeing of workers may correspond to the interests of society and to the labour collective but not to the interests of those who have to transfer to a different section, or to a different enterprise.' 99 On the positive side, the benefits of a rise in labour productivity accrue to the economy and to society as a whole. The individual worker who remains in employment has a rise in wages, his qualifications may be improved and it is possible that the 'content of labour' will also be more acceptable. 100 For workers 'displaced' from their enterprise, however, the benefits may  not  be direct and-should  they  be  unable  to  find satisfactory work-they may even become worse off. The introduction of the method 'directly impinged on every employee's personal interests. Some had to be  persuaded  to  transfer  to  a  neighbouring  plant'. 101 Parfenov  and Shvetsov  refer  to  the  resistance  as  follows:  In  accordance  with  dialectical laws, every innovation encounters psychological barriers of negation, doubt and  attachment  to  the  old  ways.  The  Shchekino  innovation  was  also complicated  by  the  fact  that  it  directly  impinged  on  every  employee's personal interests. Some had to be inspired voluntarily to assume additional workloads, others had to be persuaded to transfer to a neighbouring plant. For  a  full  six  months  prior  to  the  first  release  of  production  workers, hundreds  of  communists  conducted  exploratory  work  in  the  collective. Twelve  combine  committees  and  dozens  of  shop  committees  searched  for optimal variants of organising labour at each work-place and endeavoured to solve complex and subtle social problems . . . . 102

Overcoming such problems, the prevarication of the higher administrative personnel, and inertia probably account for the inability and unwillingness on  the  part  of  some  managers  to  adopt  the  Shchekino  method. 103 A spokesman  of  USSR  Goskomtrud  has  pointed  out  that  many  enterprises initially refused to try the experiment. The personal influence of the Deputy Minister, K. Cherednichenko, and the active support of the Party organizations  in  Tula  provided  the  energy  for  the  introduction  of  the scheme. 104 The Party Second Secretary of Tula obkom (province) is reported

as  saying  that  the  Party  had  to  persuade  people  in  the  factory  that  the practice of planning from the achieved level would cease. After convincing them, the practice recommenced and at many of the province's enterprises, plans were revised upwards six to seven times per annum. 105 A spokesman of Gosplan pointed out that such changes are caused by unforeseen changes in  the  economy: 106 from  the  planners'  point  of  view  having  'slack'  at enterprises helps them to reschedule supply.

A report by Sovetskaya Rossiya's correspondent from Tula recorded that supervisory  staff  were  afraid  to  try  new  methods  as  long  as  the  old  ones worked. As one collective put it: 'They're somewhat fearful . . . when there is a surplus of employees, it's more peaceful to work . . . '. 107 Labour reserves are  used  to  prevent  interruptions  of  work  when  workers  are  on  leave  or absent.  The  Second  Party  Secretary  in  Tula  reported  that  local  managers preferred the old system which they found easier. 108 Radov recalls that when he  was  at  the  enterprise,  'the  chairman  of  the kolkhoz under  the  factory's patronage  came  there.  .  .  .  He  reminded  them  that  he  was  expecting  100 workers  daily  and  that  a  hostel  had  to  be  built  for  them.  The  factory management was not against this . . . . But the trouble was to procure the helpers. For the kolkhoz was not the only enterprise under its patronage. It had  to  send  people  to  the  brick  works,  to  construct  roads  and  to  pick vegetables.' 109 Hence  the rationale of the local management  and  its opposition to 'freeing labour' is clear.

Another  important  reason  for  the  reluctance  of  enterprises  to  adopt  the method  is  that  'it  is  more  advantageous  even  in  economic  terms  for  an enterprise to have a surplus than a shortage of manpower. The enterprise's status  is  determined according to numbers. The more people there are, the bigger the wage fund and likewise also of the bonus resources." 110 Radov points out that the managers' salaries depend on the size of the workforce, not  on  how  effectively  it  is  used.  As  the  factory  administration  and  the Ministry officials had some fear of change, it is understandable that the Party organization played an important part in pushing such reforms. Radov points out  that  economic  organs  (economists  and  managers  of  enterprises)  had almost to be forced into applying the method by the local Party organs. 111

## Displacement of Labour at the Enterprise

Comprehensive statistics have not been collected on the numbers of workers 'displaced' 'redistributed', 'freed', 'transferred' or plainly made redundant as a result of economic change, particularly following the introduction of laboursaving  machinery  or  improved  work  organization.  In  the  period  1971-75 enterprises  under  the  USSR  Ministry  of  Ferrous  Metallurgy  shed  350,000 jobs as a result of increased labour productivity. Of these, 270,000 workers were  'transferred  to  other  sectors  of  production'. 112 The  guidelines  for  the formulation of the Five-Year Plan (1976-80) for the Production Association recommended that a plan be drawn up for an absolute and relative reduction of  the  manual  labour  force  for  each  year  of  the  Five  Year  Plan.  But  in practice, reductions in the numbers of manual workers have been unevenly distributed  over  the  USSR.  In  Latvia,  a  'complex'  programme  for  the contraction of physical labour was drawn up in 1976 by Gosplan, Goskomtrud  and  the  Central  Statistical Agency.  It  covered  14  republican. ministries and departments and 65 enterprises under All-Union jurisdiction. Between 1976 and 1978, 12,900 workers doing physical labour were made redundant, the work of 14,300 was mechanized and 19,400 were redeployed to  other  jobs. 113 By  1980,  however,  it  was  reported  that  'the  majority  of enterprises have not developed such plans'. 114 For the period 1981-85 many regional  schemes  were  being  put  into  effect  which  aimed  to  maintain planned  growth  with  the  same  or  a  smaller  labour  force. 115 In  this  plan period ministries, association and enterprise have been required to cut their manual  labour  force. 116 Some  positive  results  have  been  reported.  In  the Ukraine  between  1980  and  1983,  2.4  million  full-time  workers'  positions were eliminated ( n ) against 1.9 million planned. 117 Subjecting production to 'the  scientific  organization  of  labour'  (time  and  motion  studies)  led  to  the elimination  of4600jobs  in  the  Ukraine  (1983)  and  more  than  8000  more were expected to be lost in 1984. ll8 It  is  confidently  stated  that  one  fifth  of required  labour  productivity  may  be  achieved  by  means  of  the  'scientific organization of work'. 119 But L.A. Kostin reports that the experience of 35 industrial ministries in the eleventh Five-Year Plan showed that in the first two years of the Plan they were unsuccessful in reducing the labour force by the planned number of 1.2 million manual workers. 120

The  data  and  opinions  cited  above  would  indicate  that  the  'freeing'  and redeployment of labour in the Soviet Union is occurring, though at too slow a rate to meet adequately the advances in technology which are taking place.

## How Displacement Affects the Worker

We  have  noted  that  'displacement'  in  the  USSR  does  not  result  in  an unemployed stat us, as in capitalist societi es. A study of the effects on the worker of 'freeing' through the Shchekino method has been reported by L. Gol/din  in  the  journal Sotsialisticheski  trud (no.  3,  1980). A  questionnaire was completed anonymously by 'several thousand' respondents at enterprises adopting the Shchekino method. Though this is by no means comprehensive it  gives  many insights into how the Soviet authorities went about reducing and redirecting the labour force.

Study of the workers' responses, according to Gol' din, showed that none had  any  fear  of  being  unemployed. 121 Prior  to  the  introduction  of  the method, Party and other groups spent a considerable time explaining to the workforce the advantages of the system. Six months prior to the first release of  production  workers,  'hundreds  of  communists'  conducted  exploratory work in the factory. Twelve factory committees were formed in addition to many  workshop  committees.  These  groups  solved  'subtle  social  problems' including  presumably  decisions  about  who  should  be  made  redundant. 122 Before  the  method  was  introduced  it  was  agreed  by  the  members  of  the whole collective and not just introduced by the management. 123 Considerable  on-the-job  training  in  other  skills  was  given  at  the  various enterprises:  at  the Azot combine,  every  machine  operator  had  to  learn another job over a two to three-year period and at the Polimir factory, most of  the  workforce  had  retraining  before  and  during  the  introduction  of  the method. 124

A.s noted above, the problem of unemployment did not arise because an enterprise  producing  synthetic  fibre  was  being  built  in  the  vicinity  of  the combine.  Many  workers,  however,  did  not  want  to  leave  as  they  were uncertain  of  whether  they  would  have  similar  jobs  and  the  same  rates  of pay. 125

Women and older workers were not interested in changing their place of work.  It  was  the  younger  workers  who  left.  At  the  beginning  of  the experiment, the average age of the factory personnel was 27, in 1981 it was 41. This was due to the ageing of the staff and the lack of new young recruits to the enterprise. 126 Gol'din points out that, on the whole, workers 'approve of  the  introduction  of  the  Shchekino  method'.  They  are  interested  in  the material  rewards  and  later  improvements  in  the  work  process  are  of  most concern. 127 In  all,  in  the  period  1971-75,  3313  workers  at  the  Shchekino enterprise  were  displaced  ( vysvobozhdenny ),  of  whom  only  554  left  the enterprise.

A survey of nine enterprises on the Shchekino method delineated the form taken  by  the  'displacement'  of  workers.  Table  6.2  shows  that  most  of  the displacement  occurred  through  the  redefinition  of  the  jobs  of  workers (combining  activities  and  overseeing  more  units)  rather  than  through  the introduction of new technology and new processes. The total of 873 workers displaced through mechanization and automation was made up of a single, large contingent of 454 workers at the Furmana textile mill. In a study of25 oil-extraction  and  refining  enterprises  it  was  found  that  combining  jobs accounted for 11 per cent of the displacements (760 people), widening the sphere of operations 46.2 per cent

(3200) improving the organization of the engineering and the structure of the administration  of  labour  20.8  per  cent  (1400),  improving  the  structure  of laboratory  control  and  transport  10.8  per  cent  (738)  (the  figure  of  4.2  per cent  was  wrongly  calculated  in  the  original),  other  activities  7.7  per  cent (487). 128 Ruzavina, taking into account other studies, concludes that for the period  up  to  1972,  displacement  on  account  of  'technical  progress  was insignificant' and  she  gives  examples  of  factories  where  the  plan  for technical advancement was not fulfilled. 129

A study by Dolishni of the introduction of new technology in the Ukraine, though  not  indicating  the  total  number  of  workers  displaced,  shows  the relativities betweeen different types of technology and the attributed increases in labour displacement. 130 These are shown in Table 6.3. Dolishni notes that in the industry of the Ukraine, more than 8 per cent of the average number of workers were displaced during the period of the ninth Five Year Plan;  as  a  result  of  the  introduction  of  new  technology,  the  numbers  of displaced  workers  increased  39  per  cent  between  1971  and  1975. 131 Table 6.3, however, shows that displacement originating from the introduction of automated systems and computers between 1971 and 1975 was insignificant,

accounting for only 1.3 per cent of labour displaced. Dolishni points out that their  introduction  even  leads  sometimes  to  an  increase  of  personnel  to service them. 132

The industry in which labour displacement was greatest was coalmining, and light industry machine-tools and metal-working also lost relatively much labour. 133 Table  6.4  shows  the  numbers  of  workers  displaced  at  various factories in 1975. Automation and computer systems played very little role: they accounted for 50 per cent of displaced labour at the instrument factory, at the Mikronpribor plant 10 per cent, at the carriage works 15 per cent, at Lvovpribor 13 per cent, at the bio-physical instruments factory 10 per cent. Automated systems of management were introduced at only 3 out of the 17 factories quoted in the table. 134

The  vast  majority  of  workers  displaced  by  the  Shchekino  method  were absorbed  on  other  work  within  their  own  enterprises.  In  the  Shchekino enterprise itself during the period 1971-75, 3313 workers were displaced, of whom  only  554  (16.7  per  cent)  left  the  enterprise. 135 A  study  of  14 enterprises reported by Ruzavina showed that the Shchekino enterprise was exceptional, with a much higher than average dispersal of workers to other enterprises: out of a total of 1052, 24.3 per cent went to other plants, most of the  enterprises,  however,  shed  less  than  5  per  cent  in  this  fashion,  as  is illustrated in Table 6.5. The difficulty of mobility, notes Ruzavina, is that it involves  the  mobility  of  other  members  of  the  worker's  family.  The  high labour participation rate, therefore, makes movement from the existing place of work more difficult than in capitalist countries where fewer wives work in paid employment as a main occupation.

points  out  that  where  displacement  occurs  due  to  'intensive'  growth  (i.e. introduction  of  new  technology),  workers  may  need  to  be  geographically mobile. (As noted in chapter 3, the present Soviet system has no institutions to cope with such movement and no plans for such geographical mobility.) She  calls  for  a  special  office  to  be  concerned  with  labour  mobility  and movement between enterprises. 136

## Retraining

Retraining  of  workers  is  an  important  way  to  increase  productivity.  The objective  of  the  Shchekino  and  other  schemes  is  to  train  workers  with  a second or third trade. At the Angarsk petrochemical combine from 1971 to 1975,  some  10,000  workers  attended  courses  on  which  1300  learned  a second or third trade. This factory also shed 3400 workers between 1971 and 1975. At the Alma-Ata plant Kzyl-Tu during the ninth Five Year Plan, 20 per cent  of  the  workers  upgraded  their  qualifications. 137 A  report  on  Radio Moscow 138  described the introduction of robots in a heavy-engineering plant in  the  Ukraine,  in  which  forty  press  workers  were  displaced.  All  were retrained within the enterprise for other trades and during the retraining they received  their  previous  wages.  Over  a  five-year  period  500  workers  were displaced, retrained and employed within the enterprise.

In  the  ferrous  metallurgy  industry  in  the  period  1971-75  over  350,000 workers  were  'freed'  as  labour  productivity  grew.  These  were  primarily auxiliary and administrative personnel. The process of redirection, however, does  not  channel  workers  to  places  where  they  are  needed.  Retraining  is done within enterprises. Movement between enterprises is 'insignificant' and

there  are  no  effective  economic  and  organizational-legal  prerequisites  for interplant redistribution. 139

In the early 1980s, research was carried out in 13 enterprises in various industries.  It  was  found  that  of  those  who  had  transferred  from  manual  to mechanized work, 38.7 per cent had completed a training course, 52.3 per cent had 'individual' or 'group' training lasting two to three weeks, and 8.9 per cent had no training at all. 140

A study of jobs that were eliminated completely ( absolyutnoe vysvobozhdenie )  in  a  Leningrad  area  factory  in  the  1980s  shows  that  most workers  are  retrained  and  absorbed  in  their  own  factory,  very  few  were transferred  to  others-of  a  total  of  98  redundancies  only  16  moved  to another enterprise. The type of retraining for such workers is shown on Table 6.7.

Each year, new factories coming on stream, require 500-600,000 workers in the USSR, The absence of channels of redistribution, however, means that these factories with new and complicated technology are short of workers. Also when

workers leave enterprises because of the introduction of new technology, the most efficient workers are kept and the less effective freed. 141 As early as 1965, E. Manevich advocated that unemployment benefit should be paid to those made redundant due to 'technological progress', but this suggestion has not been taken up. 142 In 1978, he called again for forms of material support to be given to workers who move to new jobs, for training to be given and help also for their move. 143 Displaced workers do not have the right to the same  conditions  or  income  as  before,  though  it  seems  likely  that  the administration  will  attempt  to  find  suitable  work.  The  regulations  for  the further  introduction  of  the  Shchekino  method  introduced  in  January  1977 stipulated  that  enterprises  freeing  labour  in  order  to  reduce  the  number  of personnel  should  retrain  them  and  find  them  alternative  jobs. 144 Other commentators have advocated the introduction of unemployment benefit. G. Popov  (a  professor  at  Moscow  University  and  a  key  figure  in  present discussions) arguing fo r a significant reduction in the surplus workforce and the payment to redundant workers of a minimum wage of 80 roubles, points out that 'a clear distinction must be made between the right to work and the right to a certain wage level. A worker who leaves a plant retains his right to work, but no one is obliged to guarantee him anything above the minimum that the country is able to afford today.' 145

Such views undermine the present security and conditions of employment in the USSR. A lawyer, V. Malakhin, replying to Popov's article, argued in Pravda that paying 80 roubles (half the average wage) 'would be a flagrant violation  of  labour  legislation  and  Article  40  of  the  USSR  Constitution, which guarantees not only the right to work, but the right to choose one's occupation'. 146 Soviet officials have made it clear that unemployment benefit will  not  be  introduced  in  the  USSR. 147 The  evidence  points  to  a  great reluctance to shed labour in those enterprises which might cause difficulties for  the  further  absorption  of  displaced  workers. Most of the 'shedding' has taken place in expanding industries and the bulk of the workforce, as noted above,  has  been  transferred  to  work  on  new  units  in  the  same  or  nearby enterprises.  Under  the  Gorbachev  leadership  one  might  expect  greater flexibility  in  the  movement  of  labour.  In  1985,  in  the  resolution  'On  the Further Improvement of the Management of the Agro-Industrial Complex', people displaced through reorganization are to retain their pay for no longer than three months. 148

## Raising Productivity Through Displacement While Maintaining Full Employment

The significance of the Shchekino methods lies in the management of labour and  the  attempt  to  reduce  labour  costs  in  the  production  process.  The displacement of labour has had positive though limited effects in improving labour  productivity.  The  greatest  saving  in  labour  has  been  in  the  area  of workers' combining jobs and taking on more jobs. But this is not the limit of the method. It is clearly not the case that the system is limited by 'the level of underutilized capacity within the plant'. 149 Technical advance entails that the introduction of new technology will always enable savings in labour to be made.

As  a  managerial  device  to  reduce  the  cost  of  labour,  however,  the initiative to reward labour for greater intensity of effort comes into conflict with the principle derived from NOT (the Scientific Organization of Work) that  norms  should  be  'technically  validated',  i.e.  that  there  should  be  one technically  validated  rate  for  a  job  wherever  it  is. While  it  is  true  that  the extra pay given for increased productivity is limited, it does to some degree undermine  the  universality  of  labour  norms  and  increases  the  differentials between enterprises.

'Displacement'  has  not  led  to  unemployment  as  understood  in  the  West. Unlike under capitalism where profit is dependent in part on lowering labour costs because price is determined by demand, in the Soviet Union there is no market  compulsion  for  managers  to  minimize  total  labour  costs.  In  an administrative  system,  labour  costs  are  given,  and  supply  determines  the price of commodities. Producers seek to maximize the inputs, not the surplus between costs of production and the selling price. 'Scientifically determined norms' for work should provide a common basis for the level of wages for all kinds of labour. In practice, however, this is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.  The  resort  to  allow  enterprises  greater  initiative  is  a  short-term solution  to  the  problem  of  reducing  labour  levels,  but  is  at  the  cost  of violating the principle of the consistent application of labour norms.

The absence of a labour market enables the planners to provide occupations for all who seek work-something which evades governments in  advanced capitalist states. It does this, however, at an economic cost of underemployment  and  the  inefficient  use  of  labour.  The  use  of  a  labour

market in the western sense would destroy the planning system. Administrative measures  are the only feasible way  in which  greater efficiency can be achieved.

The rises in productivity planned in the current (twelfth) Five Year Plan will  lead  to  a  reduction  estimated  at  between  13  million  and  19  million people at present employed in the primary and secondary sectors, with the number of manual labourers falling between 15 and 20 per cent. 150 This will involve a major shift of manpower between sectors. The service sector will grow  considerably and greater mobility between  occupations will be necessary.

One may optimistically forecast that such labour shifts will occur without the  development  of  mass  unemployment.  Kostakov,  in  an  interview  with Tass  (subsequent  to  the  article  cited  above)  has  argued  that  displaced workers  should  be  retrained  on  full  pay. 151 The  Soviet  economy  will continue to pay a social cost for the employment of people at a full wage for less than a full workload. Further reductions could be made in the length of the working  week,  in  the  provision  of  part-time  employment,  and  in increasing  the  length  of  full-time  education.  The  systemic  character  of underemployment  is  an  advantage  in  maintaining  high  levels  of  labour utilization if a high level of formal employment is considered to be morally desirable and politically feasible.

However, the increasing pace of technological change and the requirement to  displace  labour  to  ensure  increases  in  productivity  will  undermine  job security.  It  seems  likely  that  jobs  will  be  lost  and  that  workers  will  be required  to  find  new  ones  through  the  labour  exchange  and  to  move,  if necessary, to places where jobs are available. Extended severance pay and retraining allowances will probably be introduced as substitutes for unemployment benefit,  which  for  ideological  and  political  reasons  will  be impossible to introduce.

## 7 Distinguishing Features of the Soviet Labour Market

## Employment and the Dual Labour Market

The main thrust of recent scholarly western writing on labour has been in terms of dual and segmented markets.  Such paradigms cannot be applied to 1 Soviet-type  societies  without  considerable  modification-if  they  can  be said to be relevant at all. Western writers who point to similarities between the  capitalist  and  the  Soviet  labour  market  ignore  the  context  in  which labour  is  employed.  While  we  may  not  dwell  here  on  the  economic  and 2 political  system  in  which  labour  is  engaged  under  capitalism  and  state socialism,  some  of  the  major  contrasts  may  be  summarized  before  we consider problems of productivity and work organization.

A  'market'  in  its  most  general  sense  is  a  mechanism  which  reconciles supply  and  demand.  It  is  assumed  that  there  are  specific  and  opposed interests which constitute the forces of demand and supply. The market as an  arena  of  exchange  reconciles  the  interests  of  the  bargaining  parties. Many  theorists  interpret  such  market  exchanges  as  being  to  the  mutual advantage  of  both  parties:  when  equilibrium  is  reached  each  side  has  a satisfactory outcome. The effects of market activities, it is asserted, are to coordinate  and  distribute  resources  in  an  optimum  way;  efficiency  and effectiveness  are  achieved.  As  a  result  of  market  exchange,  the  worker receives his just desert.

Other writers on the labour process, however, deny both the reciprocity of  exchange  and  the  justice  of  market  outcomes  (see  below  pp.  218-19). From such viewpoints markets are regarded as mechanisms which lead to the  domination  of  one  group  over  the  other  and  it  is  concluded  that  the exchange relations  are  unequal  and  outcomes  are  to  the  advantage  of  the powerful (capital). The labour market is constituted of mechanisms through which  the  hiring  of  labour  is  arranged;  wages  or  salaries  reconcile  the

interests  of  employer  and  employee.  Many  theorists  of  labour  markets conclude that the employer is dominant. Under capitalism surplus has to be extracted  from  the  employee.  The  reserve  army  of  unemployed  severely weakens  the  bargaining  power  of  labour.  Labour  markets,  however,  are more complex than a mere confrontation of worker and employer. To ensure a stable and loyal work force some firms under capitalism replace personal forms of control (hiring 'at the factory gate'; firing on the factory floor) with bureaucratic control.

Two types of labour market are thus established. The 'secondary' market in which personal control continues: workers are hired with no security or provision  for  a  career  or  advancement;  the  level  of  skill  typically  is  low, turnover is high and wages are poor; workers in such jobs usually have little education  and  are  often recruited from  certain social groups-ethnic minorities, school-leavers, women.  In  the 'primary' market, however, security  of  tenure  for  the  employee  is  achieved  and  promotion  within  the firm  is  possible;  turnover  is  low,  wages  are  high,  employees  are  usually recruited from established social groups with good levels of education.

The  primary  labour  market  reduces  levels  of  uncertainty  for  employer and employee. It does not, however, entail an equality of exchange. Labour market  theorists  would  interpret  the  primary  market  as  a  sophisticated device  to  ensure  the  control  of  the  employee  by  the  management  of  the firm. As Edwards has put it: 'The new system of control, devised both as part of the corporation's response to the general worker threat to capitalist hegemony and as a specific strategy to ameliorate the crisis of control in the firm, was bureaucratic control'.  In essence, in return for relative security of 3 employment,  good  working  conditions  and  career  prospects,  the  firm  is ensured a stable, loyal and hardworking labour force. Wages and conditions of work are not determined 'on the market' (i.e. external to the firm) but are regulated internally. The firm, being in control of the labour process, is able to exert sanctions (rewards, responsibility, wages) over the 'captive' labour force.

In a command or planned economy of the Soviet type the labour market is  not  characterized  by  secondary  or  primary  markets  analogous  to  those under capitalism as described by Edwards, Reich and Gordon. The data we have  considered  lead me  to  conclude  that labour markets  are of a differentiated  form,  similar  in  limited  respects  to  dual  markets  under capitalism. The most important differences affecting the labour market are

threefold: first, production does not take place for profit realizable through commodity markets: second, the labour force is fully employed; and third, there is an absence of a national labour market.

Management has no incentive to minimize labour costs. The absence of production for profit and of the need for accumulation to take place at the level  of  the  enterprise  significantly  changes  the  pattern  of  management motivation.  For  reasons  adumbrated  above,  management  seeks  to  enlarge and spend its wages fund. It acts like a public sector institution in a western economy. Also, management is severely circumscribed in its power over the labour force. Edwards points out that under capitalism the firm is a 'system of control'. 4 Under state socialism, it is the Ministry which has analogous power; and Ministries work in conformity with the economic plan, which defines  inputs,  outputs,  the  wages  fund  and  prices.  To  overcome  the 'distortions'  caused  by  market  forces  in  determining  the  'true'  deserts  of employees (e.g. monopoly tendencies by certain groups of workers) wage rates for various skills are given to the enterprise. They are based on 'norms' which  are  part  of  national  job  evaluation  intended  to  secure  equality  of desert.

It is not  market  uncertainty  that  threatens  Soviet  management  but administrative uncertainty. Soviet enterprises are motivated to expand their workforce. To maintain a stable labour force they undermine the regulations (stipul  ated  by  the  state  committee  on  prices  and  wages)  applicable  to wages to reward workers with scarce skills. Hence in a limited respect some Soviet enterprises operate like primary labour markets as in the West. They provide out of their surpluses welfare services, and through their administrative  control  they  seek  to  distribute  rewards  of  a  material  and welfare  kind.  This  process  applies,  though  in  different  degrees,  to  all enterprises,  not  just  to  big  monopolies  which  characterize  the  primary labour  market  in  the  West.  (Small  enterprises,  as  noted  earlier  cannot compete with large ones on the scale of provision.) Moreover, as there is no ultimate threat of unemployment and as the enterprise is not evaluated by market  performance,  management  does  not  regulate  the  workforce  with Taylorist rigour. At the point of production, on the shopfloor, the 'brigade' method, to be discussed below, seeks to reward workers on the basis of their individual skill and collective performance. Hence administrative control is replaced  by  social  control  based  on  self-interest.  This  in  turn,  however, creates a contradiction in the administration of the enterprise: the notion of

universal norms for a given job is undermined by the ability of production teams to 'overfulfil' their plans and by the interest of management (for the sake of stability) to pay over the planned rates. Also, Soviet-type management does  not  have  the  authority  of  their  counterparts  in  western firms  and  workers  effectively  have  greater  control  over  the  process  of production.

Soviet  employees,  unlike  their  counterparts  in  the  West,  have  less effective  choice  of  occupational  mobility.  There  is  no  national  labour market  and  recruitment  of  labour  takes  place  through  local  informal networks  and  to  a  lesser  extent  by  administrative  placement.  Mobility  is restricted in three ways: recruitment of many entrants to the labour market is controlled administratively, geographical mobility is subject to administrative ratification (and some  cities and areas are effectively restricted to their existing population), the high full-time employment levels make husband and wife the unit of employment.

The secondary labour market, as described above, does not exist in any significant  way  in  the  Soviet  Union.  The  major  reason  for  this  is  that uncertainty of employment does not occur for the employee. Management cannot  reduce  labour  costs  by  the  recruitment  of  cheaper  labour  at  the factory gates. On the contrary: the unemployed are likely to be 'undisciplined' and minimum wages are laid down by the state committee. Even managements employing unskilled workers in low-paid sectors of the economy will attempt to provide conditions which will keep a stable labour force.  From  the  supply  side  of  labour,  administrative  controls  prevent  the immigration  of  a  'reserve  army'  of  people  seeking  work.  Whilst  we  have noted that there is a pool of underutilized rural labour in some areas of the USSR, procurement prices of agricultural products are such that underemployment is sustained in such areas. The inability of enterprises to 'push  up'  wages  to  act  as  a  carrot  and  the  absence  of  the  sticks  of unemployment  and  rural  poverty,  deter  labour  mobility,  the  growth  of  a secondary  market  and  its  associated  ethnic  underclasses  as  found  in  the West.

A Differentiated Labour Market

Labour in the Soviet Union is not a homogeneous product. Even workers with  identical  skills  have  different  conditions,  prospects  and  wages.  The labour  market  is  differentiated.  On  the  side  of  production,  certain  sectors enjoy higher wages and better conditions irrespective of the skill levels of employees.  One  may  observe  social  statuses  grouped  in  occupational clusters. Women, for instance, are less skilled than men and are concentrated in low-paying industries (textiles, catering, teaching, administration); Central Asian ethnic groups remain in traditional agriculture. The differentiation of the labour market is the consequence of complex  interchanges  between  administrative  decision,  traditional  values and market shortage.

Wage rates are determined by state committees for wages and prices in collaboration with the state planning committee (Gosplan). Such rates are not fixed in a vacuum. They reflect social and political priorities. Marxism as economic theory posits the source of wealth to be productive labour in the sense of the creation of commodities that can be exchanged for a price. Politically, men in 'productive' industries have been regarded as the core of the  working  class  which  ideologically  is  regarded  as  the  dominant  class. The  promotion  of  political  stability  and  social  solidarity  underlies  the financial  rewards  of  this  group.  'Direct'  producers  of  wealth,  therefore, receive higher rewards than providers of services. Hence manual workers in general and in extractive industries (for example, mining) in particular have higher  wage  rates  than  non-manual  professionals  (physicians,  teachers). Men traditionally work in such industries and this gives rise to differentiation  by  sex.  Wage  differentials  have  progressively  moved  away from non-manual workers to manuals as shown by Table 7.1.

Marxism  as  an  ideology,  however,  does  not  legitimate  differential rewards on the basis of sex. Traditional views about the position of women in society have influenced their work role. The feminist argument has some force here. The economic and political apparatus which regulates wages and job  recruitment  is  dominated  at  the  higher  levels  by  men  and  they, subconsciously perhaps, take it for granted that women are rightly engaged in more menial jobs and in less well paid industries and services.

SSSR for Televant D years ,

The operation of the laws of a 'shortage' economy favours the production sector. In the negotiation of a wages fund with higher administrative bodies, the  managements  of  industrial  distribution  enterprises  are  able  to  bargain for a large fund. The uneven distribution of administrative power between industrial ministries  (with  heavy  industry,  machine  tools  and  defence having  priority),  gives  rise  to  distortions  in  the  distribution  of  the  wages funds.  Hence,  though  notionally  wages  should  reflect  general  principles concerning skill, experience and work effort, in practice wage rates provide only  'floors'  below  which  wages  do  not  fall.  Groups  of  workers  in  wellendowed enterprises are able to  negotiate  higher  income. This  bargaining position is furthered by the labour shortage which induces management to hike wage payments to maintain a stable and financially motivated labour force. In this way, however, distortions in wages occur-workers with given skills  find  that  wages  vary  between  different  enterprises.  The  absence  of trade  unions  as  effective  levers  of  wage  payments  (within  and  across industries) helps maintain such distortions and anomalies.

In the services sector, the strength of employing units is weaker. These ministries have lower prestige and political muscle and this is compounded by the feminization of the workforce. Consumers are treated with indifference  and  bear  the  social  cost  of  inadequate  provision.  Wages  rise more slowly. The workforce is highly feminized, and politically women are unable to bring sufficient administrative and political pressure to raise the standing  of  their  services. A  vicious  circle  occurs  with  low-paid  workers and  underfinanced  enterprises  unable  to  provide  comparable  welfare  and social facilities (housing, holidays, childcare, clinics) to the well-endowed factories.

The  poor  servicing  of  consumers  in  many  sectors  (car,  house-building and  repair)  leads  to  suppressed  demand  and  creates  a  market  for  certain

skills  (mechanics,  plasterers,  plumbers,  painters).  The  market  asserts  its own priorities on the price of labour: individuals and groups of shabashniki (self-employed)  mop  up  excess  spending  power.  The  market  effectively fixes  a  wage  rate.  Ironically,  this  reverses  the  planners'  priorities,  for  it creates  an  aristocracy  of  labour  not  in  the  industrial  sector  but  amongst workers, including the unskilled, such as building labourers and taxi-drivers who can serve the retail consumer. In doing such part-time jobs they move out of the public sector creating further labour shortage and distortions in the  administered  ordering  of  the  labour  market.  Tradesmen  capable  of finding work in the 'private' sector are able to bargain for higher wages in the  public  sector-or  in  those  parts  of  it  with  the  ability  to  pay.  Skilled workers who lack negotiable skills (e.g. librarians, laboratory technicians, engineers, teachers, clerks) and the semiskilled (machine operators, assemblers, fitters, panel operators, computer technicians) become captives of  the  public  sector.  Divergences  between  their  income  levels  and  those exercising 'private initiative' lead to charges of 'injustice' in the distribution of rewards.

The planners are thus faced with trying to resolve many contradictions. To  further  social  justice  they  advocate  the  strengthening  of  scientifically worked out norms. But to meet production workers' demands for realistic wages and to improve labour productivity they concurrently advocate the khozraschetny brigade  (see  below,  Chapter  7).  Efficient  workers  with negotiable  skills  are  able  to  maximize  their  personal  advantage  akin  to similar  workers  exercising  private  initiative.  In  doing  so,  however,  the socialist  goal  of  equality  of  distribution  is  undermined  by  the  excessive fulfilment  of  the  principle  of  payment  by  results.  The  system  punishes employees who do not produce an 'object' but who provide services-social workers, librarians, teachers, clerks, technicians, scientists.

To conclude, the labour market under Soviet socialism is differentiated. Some  industrial sectors are well-endowed  and  workers  in them  are relatively  privileged.  They  operate  in  a  similar  way  to  primary  labour markets  under  capitalism:  workers  in  them  have  a  real  income  above  the average for a given level of skill, conditions are superior and a job for life may be pursued. This is not only for foremen and supervisory staff, but also for manual workers; indeed, Soviet enterprises cultivate 'workers' dynasties' across generations. The absence of competitive recruitment and a national (All-Union) labour market promotes internal promotion, as does the chronic

labour shortage in general. Secondary labour markets, however, do not have the same character as in the West. There is an absence of migratory labour: immigration  is  strictly  controlled  and  has  an  insignificant  impact  on  the labour market. Internal migration is limited: pockets of underemployment in the countryside are perpetuated but are not characterized by rural poverty. Full  employment  at  a  macro-level  makes  the  labour  market  a  sellers' market.  The  labour  shortage  concurrent  with  administrative  formation  of wages  obviates  the  development  of  a  qualitatively  separate  secondary labour market. Nevertheless, poorly endowed industries and services have below-average levels of pay and poorer conditions. We may call this sector a quasi-secondary  labour  market.  From  the  labour  supply  side,  it  is distinguished by feminization of the labour force. Administrative regulation of the services and retail sectors involving lower average wages and poorer conditions has led to the growth of 'individual initiative' in some trades and services.  This  has  created  a  market  in  which  labour  is  able  to  bid  up  its price. This in turn undermines the bureaucratic system of wage and price formation.  Its  logic,  in  a  context  of  full  employment  and  in  the  form  of khozraschetny brigades,  will  be  to  undermine  seriously  the  administrative determination of wages.

## 8 The Brigade System and the Work Process

## Taylorism and the Labour Process

The brigade system, as currently advocated, is a form of work organization which  modifies  in  many  significant  respects  the  dominant  paradigm  of Taylorism 1 which has had an enormous impact in the USSR. Taylorism is not just a theory of work organization and control but is a perspective on work  and  production  which  has  been  adopted  in  one  form  or  another  by both western advanced capitalism and by socialist countries. Taylorism is open to many interpretations: it is often viewed as an 'ideas system', as a form of work organization or job design, as a form of structure of control to extract  surplus   (through  pay,  time  and  motion  study,  fragmentation  of 2 work) and as an organizational theory to enhance productivity and economic efficiency.  Such approaches are not mutually exclusive. 3

Kendall  E.  Bailes  has  shown  that  in  the  early  days  of  Soviet  power, Alexei Gastev, a self-styled disciple of Taylor, emphasized the fragmentation  of  work  turning  the  workers,  even  under  socialism,  'into mechanized  and  standardized  cogs  in  a  vast  machine'.   Capitalism  and 4 socialism  share  in  common  Taylor's  goal  of  achieving  prosperity  through the  increases  of  productivity. This  is  the  objective  which  has  commended itself not only to western capitalists but also to Lenin and his followers. The controversy  over  Taylorism  turns  on  the  duality  between  its  function  of improving productivity through the scientific study of the work process and its effects of making employees work harder and thus extracting more profit under capitalism. 5

Henri  Savall   itemizes  four  propositions  derived  from  Taylor  which,  I 6 believe,  inform  western  and  Soviet  practice.  First,  scientific  management implies a reciprocity of relationships between workers, foremen,

technicians, engineers and employers. Second, efficiency in work may only be  achieved  through  the  application  of  'scientific  principles'  to  analyse methods of work. Taylor believed that there was only one way to achieve efficiency with a given process. Third, Taylor believed that the management had  the  responsibility  to  give  workers  technical  assistance.  The  hierarchy was  important  in  the  transmission  of  knowledge  and  organization  of training essential to optimize efficiency. Fourth, work  has to be a cooperative venture undertaken in the spirit of collaboration. Specialization of  work  has  to  take  place  within  the  context  of  the  development  of  a cooperative spirit.

This summary of Taylor's principles brings out four affinities with Soviet Marxism-Leninism. First, it is compatible with the Leninist organizational precepts of democratic  centralism and  central planning.  Authority is hierarchical  and  centralized.  Second,  like  Soviet  Marxism,  Taylorism  is steeped in notions of scientism, i.e. the application of scientific principles to human  behaviour.  Third,  both  Taylorism  and  Marxism-Leninism  have materialist philosophies. Finally, as noted above,  both socialism and capitalism  are  predicated  on  the  belief  that  material  abundance  may  be achieved through increased productivity which in turn can only be achieved through  collaboration  between  management  and  labour.  As  a  writer  in Pravda has put it: The objective conditions for the moulding of voluntary, conscious discipline are inherent in the very nature of socialism, above all in  public  property,  production  relations  and  the  objectives  of  production, and in the unity of the fundamental interests of the individual and society. By increasing public wealth, the worker, to an ever greater degree, satisfies his own requirements as well. . . 7

There is a duality in Thylorism between, on the one hand, its concern for efficiency, with the reduction of Costs and the rationalization of movement and, on the other, the control of the workforce to secure greater exchange value or, in the Soviet context, value for investment and the control of the workforce by management.

The brigade system in the USSR attempts to use the positive elements of Taylorism  which  have  been  absorbed  into  the  movement  called  'the scientific  organization  of  work'  (NOTnauchnaya  organizatsiya  truda . ) NOT is concerned with 'the process of organizing labour in a precise and calculated  way',  its  objective  is  to  save  on  'time,  effort  and  materials'. 8

However,  the  brigade  system  takes  into  account  many  of  the  criticisms which  have  been  made  of  the  negative  and  unsatisfactory  elements  of Taylorism. Alexei  Gastev  himself  was  subjected  to  the  criticism  that  his concept of labour involved its 'militarization' and denied it any creativity. 9 Bogdanov argued on the  contrary  that  industrialism  created  workers  who could share in 'the planning, regulating and fulfilling functions of industry'. 10 Bogdanov conceded that fragmented work and detailed control might be necessary in an undeveloped economy with an abundant supply of unskilled labour but with the development of the Soviet economy a form of 'comradely  cooperation'  would  arise  with  organizing  and  executive  tasks becoming  combined. 11 Gastev  was  also  criticized  on  the  grounds  that  he neglected  the  psychological  and  physiological  aspects  of  labour. 12 His opponents  argued  that  workers  under  socialism  should  develop  initiative and participation in production. 13

In analysing Soviet work methods and job design one should not identify aspects of the Taylor system with their American counterparts as the context of production in the USSR is quite different. In the USSR a major role of NOT  has  been  to  create  an  ethic  of  labour  in  place  of  the  laggardly, slapdash attitudes of the newly-mobilized Soviet peasantry. 14 Gastev made it  explicit  that  NOT  was  'a  means  for  raising  culture  in  general  and  a method of struggle against remnants and survivals of the peasant, Asiatic culture  of  old  Russia'. 15 Education,  training  and  induction  into  a  work culture have played a more important role (though often overlooked in the West) in NOT than they have in Taylorism in the West. NOT has always encouraged participation by the worker in the organization of things. This has been a goal, even if it has not been fulfilled, which is not the case for the American version of Taylorism.

Taylorism is widely criticized in the West for taking too instrumental a view of people at work. As Savall 16 has pointed out, people expect a great deal  from  work  and  have  had  a  long  period  of  preparation  for  it.  People have  high  expectations:  the  work  should  develop  their  intelligence  and imagination; the development of technology leads to greater cooperation in work. Taylor has been found to be wrong in assuming that there is only one 'scientifically determined' way to do a job. Mass-production processes have only a limited application and 'small-batch' production is less amenable to the high degree of specialization assumed by Taylor. The need for quality

requires  workers  who  are  conscientious  and  have  a  commitment  to,  and sense of pride in, their work. The brigade system in the USSR has affinities with Taylorism,  and  in  its  contemporary  form  seeks  to  avoid  some  of  its drawbacks.

## The System of Brigades

The brigade system is intended not only to improve labour productivity (its main aim) but also to motivate workers, to constrain the labour policy of managers, and to reconcile the interests of individual workers with those of the industrial enterprise and society as a whole. 17

Work  methods  based  on  the  self-interest  of  workers  which  had  been developed in the 1930s with the introduction of Taylorism had often led to a conflict  between  individual  and  collective  interest.  As  a  writer  in EKO described it: Social ownership of the means of production under socialism created the necessary basis for the fusion of social and personal interests. However, the interests of society, the collective, and the individual do not always coincide. Specialization of production and further deepening ' of the division  of  labour  means  that  the  interests  of  society,  the  collective,  the shop,  the  section,  and  the  individual  are  not  always  in  agreement.  For example, to assemble a machine it is necessary to have all the component parts.  For  individual  shops  it  is  not  equally  economically  advantageous [ vygodno ]  to  produce  all  the  parts  to  make  up  a  set  [ komplekt ],  therefore there  is  a  surplus  of  some  parts  ['paying  well']  and  a  deficit  of  ['poorly paying'] others. A worker doing individual work is interested in overfulfilling the plan not for the parts necessary for assembly, and thus for the end product of the enterprise, but in the most 'advantageous' [ vygodnye ] ones, the ones which pay best. In such cases material interest is at odds with the  organizational  ones  of  the  administration.  A  mechanism  is  necessary which can unite the interests of every participant in the production process with the interests of the enterprise. One such mechanism. . . is, the brigade subcontract [ podryad ]. 18

Changes  in  the  organization  of  production  requiring  workers  to  have  not one skill but many and to exercise a wider responsibility over production

tasks  make individual job  assignments  less  appropriate  and  collective  (or brigade) methods more appropriate. 19

Since the Second World War, collective forms of labour have had ups and downs  in  the  USSR.  In  1951,  in  the  Kharkov  turbine  factory,  multi-shift brigades  similar  to  the  present  ones  were  formed. 20 Brigades  of  the contemporary type began to be introduced in industry in the early 1970s, but it was not until later that decade that they were widely advocated and adopted as the principal form of work collective in the USSR. 21 Factories introducing  this  system  in  the  late  1970s  include V AZ  (V olga  automobile plant), the  Kaluga  turbine  factory,  the  Perm'  engine  building  factory, Uralmash,  the  Gomel  electrical  equipment  factory, Yuzhuralmash  and  the Konakovo mechanical instruments factory. 22

The  objectives  of  the  brigade  system  are  (a)  to  encourage  maximum effort by individual members, (b) to provide an incentive to economize on labour  employed,  (c)  to  stabilize  labour  mobility  and  enhance  labour discipline, (d) to involve workers in management, to increase their personal responsibility for state affairs in the collective, and (e) to make the labour collective not only a unit of production but also a social unit. 23 As a brigade leader put it in an article in Kommunist : 'Contemporary production demands that every worker be able to picture his place in the work process, to know on what and for what he is working, what depends on him, and to feel that his  labour  is  a  necessary  part  of  the  overall  work.  There  is  a  need  to organize labour and pay so that a worker is interested not only in fulfilling his  own  assignment,  but  also  in  achieving  optimum  end-results.' 24 While brigades have existed in the USSR since the 1930s, the contemporary form of brigade labour is wider in scope and significance. 25

The  1979  resolution  on  the  economic  mechanism  decreed  that  the brigade form of labour organization would become the 'basic' type of labour unit in the eleventh Five Year Plan. 26 The earlier brigade methods were a collection of individual job specifications with workers having individually targeted assignments and being paid according to their personal output. The contemporary system, however, seeks to specify inputs, output and wages for  a  group  of  workers  (the  brigade)  as  a  whole.  They  work  on  a  given contract  ( ediny  naryad , ) rather  than  on  individually  priced  tasks.  Such brigades  may  be  organized  by  a  given  shift 27 or  'vertically', 28 the  latter being appropriate when the process of production transcends more than one

shift.  Such  brigades  have  the  advantage of being able to include not only line  workers,  but  technicians  and  auxiliary  workers-loaders,  controllers, crane operators, machinery maintenance and repair personnel. 29 Specialized and complex brigades may be organized on a shift basis or across several shifts.  They  have  been  found  to  operate  successfully  in  both  mass  and small-batch production. 30

By 1984, 18.4 million industrial production workers out of a total of 37.9 million were organized into 1.519 million brigades. While the desired size of brigade should be about 25, in 1983, it averaged eleven and a third of all brigades  had  less  than  five  members. 31 There  were  732,000  'complex' brigades with 10.6 million workers, and 787,000 'specialized' brigades with 7.7 million participants. In 1984, 15 million brigade members (1.21 million brigades)  were  on  'single  contract'  (i.e.  they  were  given  a  total  sum  for completion of the output target). 32 By  1984, it  was  reported  that  65.6  per cent of workers in brigades were on job assignments linked to final pay. 33 While these data show a considerable rise in the number of brigades, 34 even in 1984 half of the total number of production workers were not organized in them.

A  distinguishing  feature  of  the  contemporary  brigade  method  is  that management  gives  the  brigade  a  volume  production  target  and  goals  for numbers  of  workers  employed,  and  quality. 35 It  takes  responsibility  for arranging  the  organization  of  inputs-use  of  materials,  deployment  of labour and the distribution of wages. The brigade has a yearly subcontract on the basis of which a monthly assignment for output is given; it also has a wage  fund,  an  average  wage,  a  given  workforce,  a  labour  productivity growth quota, and expenditure for tools and supplies. 36 This is known as a full  accounting  ( khozraschetny ) system  which  is  often  regarded  as  the essence of the new type brigade system. 37 In cases where time is essential to the contract (e.g. completing buildings), bonuses may be given for early finishing; this is called akkordnaya oplata. An assumption of the system is that  the  factory  management  does  not  interfere  with  the  organization  and work process of the brigade. Intermediate calculation by the management of payments  for  fulfilling  operations  is  superseded  by  the  brigade  which distributes  pay  among  its  members.  Hence  the  brigade,  rather  than  the individual,  becomes  an  accounting  and  work  unit.  However,  Yu.  Balatin (Chairman of the USSR Committee on Labour and Wages) pointed out that

in  1983  only  15  per  cent  of  brigades  were  working  to khozraschet . 38 By 1985  this figure had reached only 20 per cent, to the concern of Gorbachev. 39

It  is  well  known in all industrial societies that when workers are priced on  individual  piecework  rates,  they  maximize  wages  by  working  slowly when tested. Thus a rate for the job is secured by a minimum of effort at the cost of low productivity. A brigade contract, it is believed, will overcome this  underworking.  In  order  to  maximize  income,  fellow  workers  will 'pressuriz  e'  each  other  to  work  harder  and  to  increase  productivity.  As Gorbachev  has  put  it:  In  a  brigade  every  person  is  on  view,  and  the members  of  the  collective  themselves  evaluate  the  extent  of  everyone's participation  in  joint  work.  Here  the  principles  of  social  justice  are  more fully  realised,  both  in  earnings  and  in  other  material  and  moral  forms  of incentives.  Here  it  is  difficult  to  frinagle  and  hide  behind  the  backs  of others; the link between pledges and the final results of production is more clearly evident. 40

Incentives should be determined collectively by the brigade council ( sovet ). Such  payments  should  reflect  effort  and  skill  on  the  part  of  individual workers.  If  wages  accurately  reflect  effort  and  work,  it  is  believed  that workers will be more satisfied and the psychological well-being resulting from membership of a brigade will lead to reduced labour turnover.

There are many forms that brigades may take. 41 Specialized ( spetsializirovannye )  brigades  are  formed  of  workers  with  the  same  trade (e.g.  lathe  operators). These  are  not  the  most  appropriate  for  the  goals  of contemporary brigades as they tend to be based on individual job assignments-disaggregated by the brigade-rather than on combined work contributing to a whole product. Complex ( kompleksnye ) brigades are made up of a group of workers having many skills covering the production of a given  product  or  of  one  component  part  of  a  product.  In  these  brigades, workers combine many tasks and skills.

## Calculation of Wages

There  is  no  standardized  formula  for  the  distribution  of  pay  within  the brigade. The brigade soviet, or council, is responsible for distributing if not the  overall  wage,  then  at  least  the  bonus  part.  In  practice,  there  are  three ways in which workers are remunerated. First, equally to all members-this method is  often  adopted  in  small  brigades  with  undifferentiated  levels  of skills  and  experience. 42 Second,  and  most  generally,  workers  are  paid  the basic rate for their skill category ( razryad ), but their bonuses are calculated according  to  their  contribution  to  the  brigade's  work.  Third,  a  system  of coefficients  has  been  introduced  at  some  enterprises  to  determine  each individual's  contribution  to  the  collective's  work.  This  is  called  the  KTU ( koeffitsient trudovogo uchastiya, or coefficient of labour participation): by this method, workers are evaluated on the basis of their work effort by the brigade council. This involves estimating initiative used, capacity for work in other jobs, intensity of work and conscientiousness; and the KTU may be reduced  for  poor  discipline  or  poor  work. 43 The  value  of  defective  work may be calculated  and  not  only  will  an  individual's  KTU  be  reduced  but also  the  whole  brigade  may  suffer  a  loss.  This  encourages  workers  in brigades to reduce defective products and to pass on skills to inexperienced workers. 44 But in 1983, such coefficients were used only by 30.6 per cent of all  brigades. 45 Coefficients  are  set  monthly  for  members  by  the  brigade council. This  not  only  attempts  to  distribute  wages  more  equitably  to  the workforce  but  also  attempts  to  eliminate  the  practice  of  the  'levelling'  of wages: Unfortunately at many enterprises it is normal to 'pull up' [ vyvesti ] wages, using every possible supplementary payment, bonus etc. . . . so that a worker does not get less than a certain level. This means that payment is not  made  for  'concrete'  work,  but  on  the  basis  of  an  'average',  so  that  a worker is not offended, and does not go off to another factory - this leads to 'levelling', the 'stimulating' role of the rouble is reduced and labour is less efficient.  .  .  .  A  worker  knows  that  if  he  works  badly,  his  wage  will nevertheless be raised. One way of solving the problem is to have brigades with 'economic accounting' [ khozraschet ]* which ensures that one receives according  to  one's  labour,  providing  that  brigades  are  guaranteed  normal work. The brigade system of payment is also designed to eliminate 'peak' wages, earned by favoured workers doing well paid [ vygodnye ] operations. 46

Brigades receive bonuses for the overfulfilment of targets and for savings in materials and, by the same token, deductions in remuneration are made for non-fulfilment of targets and for excessive expenditure on materials.

## Participation in Administration

The brigade method should not be conceived of as solely an instrumentality to get workers to work harder. It is also thought that it may overcome the 'dissatisfaction'  with  work  experienced  in  the  advanced  division  of  labour and the 'fractioning' of the process. Western firms in the 1970s and 1980s have attempted to improve productivity, reduce turnover and motivate the workforce  by  various  forms  of  job  design  and  work  organization.  Job enlargement  schemes  involving  workers  combining  similar  types  of  jobs (horizontal job rotation) and job-enrichment (combining different jobs such as maintenance, service and repair-vertical regrouping) have been successfully  practised. 47 The  introduction  of  'semi-autonomous  groups'  or 'group technology' has been advocated and tried. Briefly, such schemes in the West give the responsibility to a group of workers to rotate jobs (they have been trained to do all the jobs required) and work as they wish to meet their  production  targets. 48 These  experiments  are  similar  to  those  tried  in the USSR. The foreman is made redundant and workers are given greater responsibility for their work. Such schemes in the West, however, have had only limited success. Trade unions particularly have been opposed to their introduction as they are believed to infringe union power. Management has also had reservations: the schemes destroy the traditional forms of control both by the foreman and by management's control of job design. Western firms  are  also  subject  to  intense  competition  and  the  short-term  costs  of such  initiatives  cannot  be  passed  on  to  consumers,  however  desirable  the forms of work reorganization from a social point of view.

In the USSR, O.F. Balatski, writing in EKO points out: The fractioning of the work process leads on the one hand to an increase in efficiency but, on the  other  hand,  work  becomes  more  and  more  monotonous-  research shows that after a certain stage has been reached in the division of labour, productivity stops growing or even drops. . . . In order to make labour more

attractive, to give it more content, it is necessary to look for new forms of labour organization such as the 'complex' brigade, based on an end product . .  .  .  The  growth  in  the  volume  of  production,  the  more  complicated  links between enterprises and sub-divisions, narrow specialization and differentiation of operations, all complicate the management process . . . . The  active  participation  of  all  workers  in  management  increases  their creative  interest  in  the  results  of  labour  and  forces  them  to  make  more effective use of the reserves of productivity growth. 49

Balatski points to the example of American and Japanese motor companies creating work  teams  for  assembly  and  the  consequent  rise  in  work satisfaction.

The importance of the system of production relations is emphasized by Pavlov and Gavrilenko. Writing in Literaturnaya Gazeta, 50 they  point  out that unless workers participate in administration, they may 'feel like hired [ naemny ] workers'. Having drawn attention to the fact that wage rates have risen faster than productivity, they point out that a real khozyain (boss,  or owner) would not pay himself more than he produced. They point out that the  link  between  collective  ownership  and  management  of  production  is weak. Hence workers consider not the end-product and the interest of the production  unit  as  a  whole  ( obshchego  dela )  but  their  own  individual interest. Participation in the management of production is advocated to heal this rupture. The objective of reform on the shopfloor should be to create a subjective feeling on the part of the worker of being an owner ( khozyain ) of the enterprises. The brigade system is advocated as a means to this end. It may overcome the disjunction between management and workers to some extent by devolving many of the decisions of the management to the work unit. At  the  Kaluga  turbine  works,  which  is  often  cited  as  an  example  of good  practice, 51 brigades  not  only  linked  wages  to  production  tasks  but improved the participation of management in production at all levels.

In many cases, as at Kaluga, members of the brigade councils are elected by  open  ballot  at  general  meetings  of  the  brigades.  Each  council  must include  a  production  foreman,  a  trade  union  organizer,  and  a brigadir as chairperson. 52 The  brigade  councils  have  to  be  distinguished  from  the council of brigade leaders ( brigadirs ).

Brigade leaders are a crucial link in the chain. Ideally, conscientious and efficient workers are selected and some have been assistant foremen; full-

time  training  oftwo  to  three  months  is  sometimes  carried  out  by  the Ministry. 53 The brigadirs also have their own factory council to which they are  elected  (presumably  by  all  the brigadirs )  for  a  two-year  period;  the council operates under the leadership of the factory trade union committee and the section of the administration concerned with labour and wages. 54 The  yearly  plan  is  confirmed  by  a  general  meeting  of  all brigadirs and quarterly ones  by  the  council  of brigadirs. 55 Brigadirs and  budding brigadirs attend courses, organized by the appropriate Ministry, where they learn good practice. Some schools for brigadirs have been founded under the auspices of various Ministries. 56 The brigade leaders report directly to the factory director with whom they should have a good rapport.

At some enterprises, the functions of foreman and brigadir are combined. Obviously, the rise of the brigadir seriously affects the position of foreman and Yu. Batalin has noted the need for a new definition of the latter's role. 57 B. Molodtsov, writing in Pravda , suggests that the role of the brigadir will be  to  take  over  the  personnel  and  disciplinary  functions,  leaving  the foreman to deal with the engineering aspects of production. 58 In many cases the  brigade  council  has  taken  upon  itself  as  much  as  70  per  cent  of  the decisions previously made by the foreman.

A  more  collective  attitude  towards  work  may  be  engendered  by  the brigade system and workers may begin to feel more like 'masters' of their enterprise, reflecting collective ownership of the means of production. The effects then should be to increase labour productivity. A workers' assembly ( sobranie )  is  held  monthly,  allowing  discussions  by  the  rank  and  file  of production assignments, quality of product, productivity, waste, discipline and the distribution of wages. 59 Mutual help becomes more of a feature of the  brigade  method.  After  studying  brigade  and  individual  work  at  21 factories in Irkutsk, Bronshtein points out that it is normal with piece-work organization  for  members  of  the  collective  to  go  home  and  leave  one comrade  and  the  foreman  to  complete  unfinished  work.  In  brigades,  the brigadir and all members have the responsibility to complete the work and consequently all are prepared to 'muck in'. 60

The brigade  system  should  bring  together  leading  personnel  within  the enterprise to help liaise with the management. The factory director should participate in the deliberations of the council of brigadirs and the chairperson of the council of brigadirs should be in 'constant contact with

the factory chief. 61 Brigade councils ( sovets ) composed of the brigadir, the representatives  of  the  Party,  trade  union  and  Komsomol  and  leading ( peredovye )  workers are formed which help integrate the workers into the factory administration. 62 The participation of Party and trade union representatives  ensures  consistent  administrative  and  political  control  and prevents the brigades from becoming competing political units to Party and union. 63 The presence of such influential people helps to make the brigade councils authoritative. 64

The initiative for the formation of a brigade soviet is often taken by the factory Party group. 65 The brigadir is appointed by the management of the enterprise, after consultation with the foreman  and  members  of  the brigade, 66 and this procedure is in keeping with the principle of 'one man management'. The brigade system is  introduced  by  a  decision  ( prikaz )  of the management and not at the initiative of the workforce; 67 however, the trade union committee should be consulted. 68 When the brigade system was introduced at the Krasny Ekskavator factory, for example, it was planned by the  factory's  general  director,  the  Party  Secretary  and  the  chairman  of  the factory trade union committee. 69 The prikaz defines the composition of the organizational  committee  responsible  for  the  planned  changes. 70 At  this preparatory  stage  intense  campaigns  ( agitkampaniya )  take  place  to  break down psychological opposition to change. 71 Once brigades are formed the administration still retains authority over signing on new workers, though the views of the brigade may be taken into account. 72 At the Frunze bicycle factory  former  employees  are  only  taken  on  if  a  particular  brigade  will accept them. 73 The  management thus remains in control of personnel and planning of the enterprise targets. The brigade possesses devolved authority over the work activity of its members and over levels of pay of individuals. At  Kaluga,  meetings  took  place  twice  a  month  between  the  heads  of brigades  and  the  factory  director.  Decisions  made  by  the  brigade  leaders' council, after confirmation by the director, have the force of orders of the combine. 74

A form of social control is established by members of the brigades. As researchers  writing  in Sotsiologicheskie issledovaniya put  it:  'no  one  is interested in having a poor worker in the brigade, as this affects the "end results" and overall brigade pay'. 75 The brigade heightens the effectiveness

of the teaching of new workers for 'practically the entire brigade acts as a collective  mentor  to  new  brigade  members'. 76 For  the  same  reason,  job demarcation disputes are avoided and members  have  an  interest in developing multiple skills in order to substitute for each other. Sociological research conducted in machine tool factories in the Ukraine found that 84 per  cent  of  workers  in  brigades  working  on  a  single  contract  thought  it normal to help their fellow workers, compared to 42 per cent working on individually priced jobs. It was also found that workers in brigades began on their  own initiative  to  learn  other  jobs,  so  that  they  could  stand  in  for each other. 77 On the basis of a survey of workers in 21 factories in Irkutsk, it was found that many more workers in brigades intended to learn another trade. The reasons differed considerably: for 'individual' piece workers (i.e. not in brigades) the main motivation (41 per cent of respondents) was at the request of the foreman (master) and next (29 per cent) was to fulfil the plan; for brigade workers, 62 per cent said it was the fulfilment of the plan for the collective,  the  second  most  frequently  cited  reason  (17  per  cent)  was  to make work more interesting. 78   This  in  turn  may  increase  job  satisfaction and reduce turnover. 79

## Labour Productivity

Increasing  labour  productivity  is  considered  to  be  a  major  object  of  the brigade system. As the Chairman of the USSR State Committee on Labour and  Wages  has  put  it:  A  major  area  of  the  effort  to  achieve  a  cardinal increase in labour productivity is the strengthening of collectivist principles and  the  effective  utilization  of  the  brigade  form  of  the  organization  of labour and incentives. We see the basic task here as uniting the development of the most progressive types of brigades with measures for improving the system of the management of socialist enterprises. This organic unification will be achieved primarily through the contract form of the organization of labour and pay. 80

Labour productivity is improved by workers themselves having an incentive to  'shed  surplus  labour'.  If  production  is  overfulfilled  with  less  than  the

assigned number of workers, supplementary pay is increased by 1 per cent for every percentage overfulfilled up to a limit of 10 per cent. 81 The wage fund for the brigade is not reduced if the number of workers falls below that authorized in the contract. 82

A study of brigade contracts in the Gomsel'mash production combine in one quarter of 1979 found that the total workforce had declined by 9.1 per cent on average; output per worker had increased by 13.2 per cent and the maximum and minimum earnings had risen by 1.7 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively  (comparisons  made  with  previous  year).  Some  brigades  had reduced  the  labour  force  from  10  per  cent  to  13  per  cent  a  year  whilst maintaining  the  volume  of  production. 83 A  survey  of  21  enterprises  in Irkutsk reported in 1982 84 found that, in comparison with individual pieceworkers,  the  brigade  form  of  organization  had  20  per  cent  higher  labour productivity and turnover was 40 per cent lower. 85 A report of a brigade in the building industry working in Siberia found that the average wage was 476  roubles  (compared  to  300  roubles  for  a  comparable  group),  fewer workers  were  employed  (80  compared  to  400  of  another  comparable administration).  The brigadir remarked  to  the Pravda correspondent:  it seems to me that in Western Siberia it's possible to reduce the number of construction  workers  by  a  least  one-third,  if  not  by  one-half.  .  .  .  Why should  we  keep  people  on  if  we  can't  properly  provide  them  with  work? We're paying a high price, and I don't mean wages-we're corrupting the workers,  accustoming  them  to  an  easy  living.  This  applies  not  only  to workers but to the managerial staff as well. 86

Hence brigades are a method of legitimating reductions in the workforce. Indirectly,  the  acceptance  of  responsibility  by  the  brigade  for khozraschet reduces the numbers of administrative personnel: documentation is reduced and  so  is  the  need  for  norm-setters,  quality  control  inspectors  and  sector chiefs. 87 The Vice-Chairman of the USSR State Committee on Labour and Social Questions points out that foremen under the brigade system should be capable of a larger workload and should be able to supervise two or three brigades-i.e. 50-75 workers instead of 25. 88

With the introduction of brigades at Kaluga, labour turnover dropped to a quarter of its previous level. Productivity grew enormously in the first year of work with the new brigades, it rose from 15-20 per cent, a third of the

increase  in  labour  productivity  was  claimed  to  be  due  to  the  brigade methods,  but  wages  rose  much  less  (at  just  over  the  average  for  the industry). 89 Similar  results  have  been  claimed  at  different  times  for  other industries.  In  the  building  industry,  a  famous  brigade  named  after  the builder  N.A.  Zlobin  was  formed  in  the  early  1970s  and  it  succeeded  in building a 14-storey block of apartments in 155 days instead of 235. The Soviet press is full of accounts ofthe successes of brigades. B. Molodtsov, writing  in Pravda about  the  Orekhovsk  cotton  factory,  reported  that  after the introduction of brigades, hourly output increased by 4-5 per cent, labour discipline was much improved and idle-time was down 2-3 per cent. 90  An account of the Elektrosignal factory in Novosibirsk recounts that with the introduction  of  a  complex  brigade  system,  lagging  behind  plan  targets ceased.  In  one  shop  targets  were  subsequently  fulfilled  by  50  workers instead of 65, the number of rejects also declined; in another shop, with 15 per cent fewer than the planned number of workers, output rose 5.6 times and wages doubled. 91  In 1985, it was reported that a brigade in Vladimir saved  2617  person  days  (20,800  roubles)  in  a  year,  and  workers  in  the brigade received 316 roubles in bonus. 92 In the Ukraine, a review of brigade activity found that when it was introduced absenteeism and labour turn-over fell,  and  productivity  rose.  At  another  factory  where  experiments  with brigades were tried, productivity was 2.7-4 times higher than the republican average. Turnover dropped from 13.5 per cent in 1975 to 10.8 per cent in 1979. 93 In one factory, labour turnover had declined from 27 per cent to 15 per cent. 94 I. A. Lanshin (Chairman of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Workers in Construction and the Building Materials Industry) has claimed that the introduction of brigade methods in building would increase productivity by 3.1 per cent. He advocates the setting-up of brigades of 4060 workers. 95 A study of the work of more than 1000 brigades by NII truda and  Gostomtrud,  reporting  in  1983,  found  that  in  the  year  of  formation, brigades  on  average  improved  labour  productivity  by  5-6  per  cent,  in  the next year it usually rises 6-8 per cent and in the third year, 8-9 per cent. For workers  not in brigades in these branches, labour productivity only improved  2-3  per  cent. 96 It  was  found  that  in  the  brigade  system,  wages rose  less than  productivity:  prior  to  the  introduction  of  brigades  the coefficient of productivity increase to wage increase was 1:72, afterwards it was 1:65; 97 also the average level of worker grade ( razryad ) increases from

3.1  to  3.5  with  the  movement  to  brigade  status. 98 Workers,  it  may  be assumed,  have  greater  opportunity  and  incentives  to  raise  their  levels  of skill.

## Difficulties in Forming Brigades

Articles in the Soviet press indicate, nevertheless, that the introduction of the brigade system is not without difficulties. Sometimes brigades will be set  up  only  in  a  'formal'  sense  without  any  changes  in  organization  and accounting. 99 Quite  often  management  does  not  see  the  advantage  in introducing them. There are often no improvements in economic indicators after  their  introduction-rises  in  labour  productivity,  for  instance,  may  be achieved through working overtime. 100 The administrative context is often not conducive to the effective operation of the brigade system. Irregularity in  the  supply  of  materials,  the  breakdown  of  machinery  and  inefficient servicing  leads  to  the  non-fulfilment  of  the  output  targets. 101 In  January 1985  an  article  in  the  trade  union  newspaper, Trud, pointed  out  that  the productivity of brigades in building was slowing because of the shortage of supplies  and  unevenness  of  delivery.  Sometimes  (the  same  writer  points out)  equipment  costs  rise  during  the  plan  period  and  subsequently  bonus payments  are  reduced. 102 The  logic  of  the  brigade  system  is  that all members will be penalized because they are commonly tied to the planned output. Thus collectives often break up and revert to the former individual norms because under such conditions fewer workers will be penalized if the product is not completed.

Changes in enterprise organization are essential to ensure that brigades, when  introduced,  operate  efficiently  and  effectively.  Sometimes  after  the changeover  to  a  single  contract  insufficient  technical  preparation  is  made and initially productivity and wages drop; this leads to distrust of the new methods. 103 The optimum size of brigade must be related to the process of production, and the mere copying of practice of other brigades (say Kaluga) will lead to poor results. 104

The  advantages  of  brigades  are  lost  if  only  part  of  the  enterprise  is organized. In 1980, one-shift brigades predominated, and a third of brigades

had  fewer  than  five  workers.  This  effectively  excludes  workers  from participation in the management  of production, as they concentrate narrowly  on  their  work  tasks. 105 The  importance  of  vertical  or  intershift ( skvoznye )  brigade  structures  is  often  emphasized  as  a  means  of  gaining increases in productivity, 106 but this is often difficult to achieve. Sometimes factory chiefs set up an 'exemplary brigade' and brigadir in order to impress higher authorities. 107 Some enterprises also have a poor evaluation of the potentiality of the system. 108 The  introduction  of brigades creates a powerful form of worker association which may criticize the administration, for a whole group of workers becomes aware of, and has a material  interest  in,  efficient  management.  It  therefore  becomes  more arduous for the management than dealing with individual workers who may become  resigned  to  breaks  and  interruptions  in  production. 109 Hence management  may  be  reluctant  to  adopt  the  brigade  system  and  have  a negative evaluation of it.

Sometimes the brigade system operates to subvert the planning system. Rather  than  brigades  being  conditioned  in  reaching  output  targets,  they attempt  to  negotiate  levels  of  plan  assignments. 110 Auxiliary  workers (storemen,  stock  handlers)  are  also  often  excluded  from  the  scheme.  In 1982, for example, only 10 per cent of auxiliary workers were in brigades. White-collar and engineering-technical workers are usually excluded from the  brigade  system,  though  a  Party-government  resolution  of  December 1982  called  for  large  all-purpose  brigades  to  include  engineering  and technical personnel and production organizers. 111 It  is  often suggested that their pay should also be dependent on the success (or failure) of brigades.

One  of  the  main  reasons  for  opposition  to  the  brigades  is  that  some workers fear that collective responsibility and a levelling of pay will reduce their  status  on  the  shopfloor. 112 In  an  attempt  to  explain  the  reluctance  of workers to form brigades, Bronshtein studied the characteristics of workers in brigades and those who did not wish to work in them. The average age of workers  opposed  to  joining  brigades  was  11  years  older  than  the  factory average. They also had longer than average length of service at the factory. They  were  skilled  workers,  earning  on  average  295  roubles  (67  roubles more than the average factory wage). The level of education was lower than average.  These  workers  had  the  well-paid  ( vygodny )  jobs,  they  had  good relations  with  the  foremen,  received  low  targets  to  increase  productivity

and, due to their experience, enjoyed a high status in the collective. Such workers used their influence to minimize rises in annual output norms and rises in productivity. 113 Hence it would appear that a sort of 'aristocracy' of labour with high levels of skill, wages and experience has a material interest in  opposing  the  brigade  system.  To  overcome  such  problems  it  is  often contended  that  such  organization  should  be  extended  to  encompass  the whole factory as a brigade system. 114

A more negative evaluation of the operation of the brigade system has been made by Nina Maksimova on the basis of visits to five machine tool and  ferrous  metallurgy  enterprises. 115 The  thrust  of  her  article  is  that  the brigade system develops 'instrumental' mercenary attitudes among brigade members who become estranged one from another. Some brigades do not want  untrained  workers  because  initially  they  lower  productivity;  the increased  speed  of  operations  leads  some  workers  purposely  to  disrupt production  to  earn  rest  periods.  After  initial  hikes  have  been  made  in productivity,  further  increases  become  progressively  harder  and  brigades again  begin  to  conceal  reserves.  Working  out  the  coefficient  of  labour participation creates friction among the brigade members, as disagreements arise  about  the  relative  efficiency  and  personal  contributions  of  different members,  and  subjective  evaluations  frequently  occur.  Participation  in brigade meetings and by the brigadirs were often inadequate and management often usurped the position of brigadir or chose brigade leaders to their liking.

The  inertia of management  in  introducing,  and  of  the  workers  in accepting, the brigade system is to be overcome through the activity of the Party organization. The Party factory group has a particular role to play in combating  inertia  and  demanding  a  new  style  of  leadership  from  the management. 116  The 1982 resolution calls upon republican and lower Party organizations to get going the brigade form of organization. Party primary groups in enterprises should help to mould 'a healthy moral and psychological climate, [to develop] labour and public awareness, [to instil] in the collective's members a lofty responsibility for the fulfilment of plan assignments  and  adopted  socialist  pledges  .  .  .  .  [T]he  primary  [Party] organizations at enterprises should set up Party commissions for monitoring management's  activity  in  introducing  the  brigade  form  of  labour  and

heightening its effectiveness.' 117 The trade unions have been called on to be more vigilant in bringing to task managers who break agreements. 118

## Evaluating Brigades

Press  reports  and  individual  accounts  of  the  difficulties  of  industrial organization are useful in portraying perceptions of correspondents, but one can never be sure of their representativeness. A number of studies have been made  by  sociologists  which  have  attempted  to  examine  empirically  and objectively the progress of the brigade system. A study in 1982-83 by Ille and Sinov 119 of nine machine  tool factories located in eight cities interviewed  1684  workers  in  211  brigades  and  329  representatives  of  the shopfloor administration. They found many deficiencies in the organization of brigades. Of those surveyed 54.2 per cent said that they had not learned to use their rights in the brigades. (It has been reported, for instance, that the administration  distributes  wages  and  defines  the  parameters  of  KTU.) 120 About 40 per cent of those surveyed considered that the administration was not interested in giving workers real rights to control the management, and 30  per  cent  thought  that  the  administration  encouraged  participation  but ignored  their  suggestions. 121 Participation  in  the  shop  councils  was  also irregular:  a  quarter  of  workers  polled  had  not  been  to  a  meeting  in  the previous  year,  and  40  per  cent  had  not  attended  more  than  three  or  four times. However, the majority of workers surveyed found that in the brigade system  work  was  more  varied,  interesting  and  testing.  Another  study  of workers in the Kostroma electric supply found that 75 per cent of manual workers and 72 per cent of engineering and technical workers approved of the transfer to the brigade system; 50 per cent thought that pay and work safety  had  improved,  40  per  cent  thought  that  norming,  participation  in production and relations with the foremen had improved. In addition, those interviewed thought that work efficiency could be enhanced by improvements  in  work  conditions  (72  per  cent),  pay  (64  per  cent)  and organization of labour (59 per cent). 122

E.  I.  Khrishchev  has  reported  on  research  conducted  at  20  industrial enterprises in Kishinev, Moldavia in 1976 and 1982. 123 Between 1976 and

1982, it was found that the number of respondents favourably disposed to the  development  of  the  brigade  method  increased  (80  per  cent  in  1982 compared to 69 per cent in 1976). The researchers compared the respondents' attitudes to various aspects of labour: they were analysed into three  categories:  high,  middle  and  low  levels  of  satisfaction.  Some  of  the data are shown in Table 8.1. The totals of categories (high, middle and low) sum to 100 per cent; only 'low' and 'high' satisfaction is shown in the table. Table 8.1: The Distribution of Workers by Degree of Satisfaction with Different Aspects of Labour Activity in Production Brigades in Enterprises in Moldavia, 1976 and 1982. (% of total surveyed)

Table  8.1  shows  that  attitudes  toward  various  aspects  of  labour  by brigade  members  had  improved  between  the  two  dates.  By  1982,  79  per cent of brigade members had a high evaluation of the labour collective (52 per cent in 1976) and only 11 per cent had a low evaluation (18 per cent in 1976). The content of work, relations to the administration, participation in management, the 'perspective' on production all had higher positive scores in  1982  than  in  1976.  However,  more  workers  felt  that  there  was  greater danger and there was more dissatisfaction with pay (27 per cent had a low satisfaction  level  in  1982,  compared  to  18  per  cent  in  1976),  the  level  of nervous stress also rose ('high' satisfaction fell from 52 percent in 1976 to 44 per cent in 1982). The more negative aspects may have been caused by

some resentment at changes in wage differentials which were not compensated by increases in earnings, and the greater stress may have been due  to  a  higher  work  rate  and  more  complicated  tasks.  Khrishchev  notes that less than half of the surveyed workforce had a high level of satisfaction on this score. This confirms the views of Maksimova, cited above.

The  survey  analysed  changes  by  type  of  work  unit.  Over  the  six-year period, it was found that in brigades with a mixture of trades ( kompleksnye , ) the levels of grade increased by 18 per cent, in single trade ( spetsializirovannye ) brigades it rose 14 per cent, and for those not working in brigades, only 6 per cent. 124 Greater initiative with respect to innovation was shown in the mixed trade brigades where 20 per cent of those surveyed had  made  suggestions,  compared  to  only  8  per  cent  in  single  trade brigades. 125 Similarly, the brigade system led to greater demands on the part of their members compared to individual workers. The numbers of brigade workers dissatisfied with the activity of the permanent production meetings rose  by  15  per  cent  (7  per  cent  for  individual  workers),  people's  control groups,  19  per  cent  (7  per  cent)  and  with  informational  meetings  and meetings with the director, 26 per cent (4 per cent). Khrishchev argues that the  brigade  method  gives  workers  a  greater  awareness  and  interest  in  the affairs of the whole factory, whereas 'individual' workers focus on their own conditions and pay. 126

Another  study  carried  out  in  the  Urals,  soon  after  the  introduction  of brigade  methods,  compared  brigade  members  and  workers  on  individual piece-work jobs. It was found that the former were more dissatisfied with production  conditions  than  the  latter. 127 Table  8.2  shows  that  of  brigade members 25 per cent were dissatisfied with the planning of work, 42.4 per cent with the condition of equipment, 33 per cent with the organization of work, and 32 per cent with the rhythm of work, those on piece-work were correspondingly more satisfied on all these counts. 128 The authors point out that such dissatisfaction is caused by poor organization of the brigades. Also when work is organized on an individual basis, organization is something abstract  and  only  impinges  when  the  individual's  work  is  interrupted,  in brigade methods, however, organization becomes magnified, as all administrative miscalculations affect the non-completion of the final project.

The brigade  system  acts  collectively  as  a  pressure  group  on  management and exerts more influence than the sum of individual workers' grievances. Management subject to poor planning may resist the introduction of brigade methods because they are a threat to inertia.

Workers in brigades had a higher estimate of the use of their knowledge and abilities than those working  individually. Their evaluations also increased over time, as may be seen from the data shown on Table 8.3.

Evaluations  of  various  aspects  of  activity  in  work  by  three  different forms  of  labour  organization  (mixed  brigades,  single-trade  brigades  and individual work) are shown on Table 8.4. The data cited refer to those with 'high'  levels  of  satisfaction.  The  results  show  that,  in  1982,  the  mixed brigades  had  higher  scores  on  nearly  all  indexes  compared  to  the  singleskill  brigades  and  individual  workers;  conversely,  those  working  outside brigades had lower levels of satisfaction than those in them. One exception may be noted: this concerns quality, in which individual workers excelled more  than  the  other  two  groups.  In  order  to  fulfil  output  norms,  those working in brigades may have had to 'rush' work, leading to poorer quality. In  the  mixed  brigades,  the  index  of  good  quality  work  only  rose  4  points (from 56 to 60) between 1976 and 1980, and in the single-skill brigades it actually fell (from 78 to 64).

Considering the changes over time, a consistent pattern may be discerned of  generally  rising  levels  of  satisfaction  in  the  mixed-skill  brigades,  an uneven  profile  in  the  single-skill  brigades  and  a  decline  in  levels  of satisfaction  by  those  working  outside  brigades.  One  exception  may  be noted:  those  not  in  brigades  improved  considerably  the  deployment  of advanced  skills  (a  rise  from  32  in  1976  to  51  in  1982),  Of  the  workers surveyed in 1982, 73 per cent had a firm opinion about the brigade form of labour, 60 per cent considered that this form of organization and stimulation of labour undoubtedly contributed to the improvement of labour discipline and the improvement of the quality of work. 129

## Conclusion

Considered  in  the  context  of  western  developments  in  management  and work organization, the brigade system has many positive attributes. Despite some  drawbacks,  the  brigade  system,  if  implemented,  is  likely  to  be  an economic and social advance and will lead both to enhanced productivity and  greater  worker  satisfaction.  It  combines  the  need  for  greater  worker satisfaction and participation with economic stimulation which meets both the  needs  of  the  enterprise  to  improve  productivity  and  the  worker  to benefit from the gains of productivity. While forms of worker participation in  the  USSR have been criticized as being inadequate by western writers, they do in practice involve very much more control over the job situation than do western experiments. 130 In the West workers resist management. 131 All  schemes  for  worker  participation  (western  and  Soviet)  are  advocated within  the  context  of  production  goals  set  by  management.  The  brigade system combines job enlargement, job enrichment, job rotation, control of the work setting and participation in the design of the job process and the distribution  of  wages.  The  expectations  for  satisfying  work  are  probably

higher  in  the  USSR  than  in  the  West  and  such  schemes  therefore  would seem to be more appropriate.

The  obstacles  to  the  introduction  of  such  'semi-autonomous'  groupings are quite different from the pressures in the West. In the USSR, the market does  not  have  the  same  limiting  effects.  Enterprises  are  not  subject  to market pressures, and wage costs do not have comparable significance (they only imperfectly reflect demand and supply, and rises in wages or in prices do  not  lead  to  lay-offs  or  redundancies).  Formal  worker  resistance  to regrouping of skills orchestrated in the West by trade unions does not occur in  the  USSR.  The  dominant  ideology  sustains  the  notion  of  a  unity  of interest between management and employee. This is buttressed at all points by  the  Party  organization  (and  by  the  trade  unions).  While  resistance  by workers to managements' attempts to raise the intensity of efforts occurs, there  is  an  absence  of  any  counter  ideology  and  organization  sustaining worker opposition to the semi-autonomous group. Similarities with western types of resistance lie with management and with an 'aristocracy' of wellplaced  workers.  The  former  sees  the  develpment  of  semi-autonomous groups of the brigade type not just as a challenge to their authority, but as a source of criticism of inefficiency and ineffectiveness. Individual workers with experience and authority in the enterprise likewise regard brigades as threats  to  their  own  status  and  privilege.  The  greater  emphasis  on  an increased pace of labour effort through brigade pressure is likely to lead to some resistance on the part of workers who put a greater emphasis on the work place as a social community. 132

- *  'Economic  accounting'  ( khozraschet )  means  that  the  cost  of  all  production  inputs  (materials, energy, labour) are considered in the calculation of the brigade's earnings.

## 9 Full Employment and Labour

## Shortage: The Direction of Change

In the foregoing analysis, it has been demonstrated that in distinction from capitalist societies, a very high rate of labour utilization is a feature of the Soviet economy.  We  may  conclude  that  the  Soviet  labour  market  is characterized by: (a) the employment of a large proportion of the population leaving no 'reserve army' of unemployed or self-employed; (b) the underutilization of labour at the place of work-'hoarding' or maintenance of labour reserves, and (c) a market shortage of labour: the labour market is a 'seller's market'. Labour utilization in the USSR is not characterized by mass unemployment. The main disutility is in various forms of underemployment. By underemployment one has in mind conditions in  which  persons  are  in paid employment but their labour is not used efficiently: they may be idle for all or part of the time, or their level of skill is higher than required in the job they do. The Soviet economy may be characterized as one of labour shortage and  labour  underutilization.  Shortage  may  be  defined  as  a  state  in  which effective demand for labour (or the number of jobs) outstrips supply. Labour 'shortage', however, is complicated by considerations of the efficient use of labour,  by  whether  the  supply  of  jobs  is  inflated,  and  by  whether  the requirements of production may be met by fewer workers. Such considerations involve technical, managerial, educational, psychological and cultural criteria.

Here I shall turn from empirical analysis to consider explanations of the full-employment  low-wage  economy  characteristic  of  the  USSR.  First,  I shall  examine  three  "  general  approaches  to  the  socialist  full-employment economy; second, I shall develop my own sociological paradigm (including elements from all three of these paradigms): and third, I shall indicate some probable  developments  in  terms  of  reform  in  the  USSR  in  the  coming decade.  In  explaining  the  level  of  full  employment  (i.e.  the  'quantity'  of people at work) one should also take into account the nature of employment (i.e. the 'quality' of work).  One  needs  to  grapple  with  three  distinct dimensions  of the labour market: full employment  at  a  macro-level, underemployment at a micro-level, and a general chronic shortage of labour.

The  effects  of  the  Soviet  labour  market  give  rise  to  a  strong  bargaining position  of  labour  at  the  place  of  work  and  to  a  regime  of  'soft'  labour discipline.

One  may  distinguish  three  explanations  of  the  high  though  inefficient labour utilization rate in socialist societies. The first regards full employment as  a  positive  consequence  of  government  policy.  A  second  interprets  the labour market  in terms of over-full employment  and  emphasizes  the inefficient under-utilization of labour. A third considers the labour market in terms of systemic contradictions.

## The Government Policy Approach

The  structure  of  the  Soviet  labour  market  and  its  ensuing  problems  are explained  by  many  writers  in  terms  of  government  policy.  A  socialist economy, it is argued, rests on public ownership and planning and ensures the maximum utilization of labour power. Workers are not left unemployed which is a social cost, but are utilized gainfully at work. Government policy under planning has a goal of providing work. The policy of a fully employed but low-paid workforce is a response both to the ideological imperatives and to the requirements of modernization under conditions of state ownership of the means of production and central planning. It fulfils the economic need to utilize the workforce,  and  at the same  time  it provides  employment implementing the political objectives mentioned earlier. In the early period of  Soviet  power,  industrialization  and  economic  growth  was  the  primary objective  of  the  Soviet  government,  but  once  full  employment  had  been achieved,  it  became  a  sacred  element  in  Soviet  social  policy.  The  duty  to provide  full  employment  is  derived  from  the  legitimating  ideology  of Marxism-Leninism.  From  this  point  of  view  full  employment  cannot  be abrogated without seriously weakening the integrity of Soviet society. The provision of full employment and the overcoming of alienation at work are legitimating  factors  for  the  regime  in  the  world  order.  Soviet  statesmen  as well  as  philosophers  and  journalists  point  to  the  fact  that  'the  majority  of representatives from the capitalist world, no matter what their political views or class background, recognize that the right to work is a great achievement of socialism. . . . Soviet society is a society of people at work' ( lyudi truda ). 1

There is  an  international  dimension  to  internal  policy:  the  weakening  of  a policy  of  full  employment  (perhaps  more  so  than  a  decline  in  the  rate  of economic  growth)  would  cast  in  doubt  the  Soviet  claim  to  be  a  socialist state. The political framework, in which the Communist Party is legitimated as  the  expression  of  the  interests  of  the  working  class,  ensures  that  full employment is a priority. In essence, full employment is considered to be a consequence of socialist planning.

Shortage of labour and the under-utilization of labour are regarded by this school  of  thinkers  to  be  imperfections-the  unintended  consequences  of planning are due to 'lack of fit' between labour supply and labour demand. V. Medvedev, criticizing western conceptions of a 'deficit economy', considers that 'shortage' is not an  innately inherent characteristic of a planned economy. 2   Deficits  persist  because  of  disproportions  in  planning  and  nonfulfilment of plan targets. Labour shortage occurs because of disruption in the  system  of  production  in  which  managers  hoard  labour  reserves.  The remedy is not merely adjustments of supply and demand but reform of the planning  mechanism  involving  the  liquidation  of  the  discrepancy  between money appropriations and material resources to coordinate the money supply with  the  improvement  of  labour  productivity.   A.  Kotlyar  conceives  of 3 'labour shortage' as a non-antagonistic contradiction which may be resolved through  the strengthening of the planning  mechanism. 4 Movement  to 'intensive'  production  with  rising  productivity  will  lead  to  the  reduction  of the number of people employed in production; in time, a shift of labour to services will take place and a shortening in the length of the working day will  occur. 5 Full  employment  of  labour,  however,  will  be  ensured.  Other sources  of  labour  shortage  are  demographic  considerations  (fluctuating levels of birthrate, mismatch  between  geographical  areas  of  industrial development and labour supply) and the education system 'lagging behind' changes  in  technology  leading  to  an  inappropriately  skilled  workforce; labour  discipline  and  socialization  are  inadequate.  Organizational  methods are poor and enterprises are given too slack a wages fund or fail to improve productivity.  Improvements in planning the size, training  and  discipline  of the labour force are seen to be antidotes to the inefficient and wasteful use of labour. This  line  of  reasoning  is  taken  by  most  economic  reformers  in  the USSR who believe that the  existing  structures  need  perfecting  rather  than changing in any significant way.

## The Need for a Market

Some western writers also explain labour shortage as due to deficiencies in the planning of labour but they see such deficiencies as an inherent part of the  planning  system.   Thus  a  second  approach  is  to  fa  ult  the  system  of 6 planning as such. To raise labour productivity and the efficiency of labour some Soviet specialists  and  most,  if  not  all,  western  economists,  advocate the use (or greater use) of the market. Labour shortage and under utilization are caused, it is argued, by  wages  being  too  low  and  insufficiently differentiated by market forces. Overemployment is a cause for sorrow not rejoicing. If the price of labour reflected supply and demand, there would be no  chronic  shortage  at  a  macro-level  (though  'frictional'  unemployment would  persist):  a  higher  cost  to  the  enterprise  would  stimulate  its  more efficient use and  reduce overmanning,  higher  wage  incentives  would increase  labour  productivity.  Wages  would  more  accurately  reflect  the contribution of the worker  to output, and  labour mobility would  be enhanced;  real  'shortages'  would  be  ended  through  the  inflow  of  workers seeking higher wages. Wage differentials would reflect economic needs not political priorities. The development of a proper labour market would lead to the shedding of surplus labour, a pool of unemployed and the seller's market in labour would become a buyer's one. These policies involve major changes in the system of planning and the dismantling of a command economy. The forces  of  the  market  would  replace  many  of  the  activities  which  are  now subject to administr ative control. The present high rate of labour utilization would  fall;  fewer  people  would  be  employed  but  they  would  be  more effectively used and better paid.

It cannot be doubted that the 'market' in economics and politics has been a major  innovation  accompanying  the  rise  and  consolidation  of  capitalism both  as  a  form  of  economy  and  in  terms  of  bourgeois  democracy.  n  has enlarged  the  area  of  individuals'  positive  freedom  through  giving  more choice.  However,  the  market  has  costs.  The  market  militates  against  other values-t hose of community, and of control of the  environment. As  R.E. Lane  has  cogently  argued,  it  restricts  opportunities:  amenities,  privacy, cultural  goods,  safety,  cleanliness  and  public  goods  generally. 7 Fulfilling market-generated needs reduces other forms of gratification and well-beingfamily, love, health, friendship.  It works against equality: choice is limited 8

by  unemployment  under  capitalism  and  labour  markets  are  themselves socially  strati  fied.  Market  capitalism  has  not  secured  full  employment  for the  labour  force.  In  Japan  where  there  is  job  security  in  industry,  this  is limited to a relatively small proportion (18 per cent of the labour force) of 'permanent  employees'.  The  registered  unemployment  rate  of  2.5  per  cent grossly under represents the real level of unemployment-26 per cent of all female workers are part-time; in 1974, unemployment rates of 10 percent for men  and  40  percent  for  females  have  been  calculated.  There  is  a  large secondary  labour  market  with  low  wages,  high  turnover,  the  absence  of unionization and lack of unemployment  insurance. 9 The  market  may generate  needs  for  work  and  income  that  cannot  be  fulfilled  and  thereby create dissatisfaction. Market forces in the arena of the industrial enterprise severely  limit  job  redesign  and  worker  participation  both  of  which,  if introduced, would increase production costs. More important from a Marxist standpoint,  impersonal  market  'laws'  put  their  outcomes  outside  direct human  control.  The  market  is  the  antithesis  of  a  Marxist-  Leninist worldview  which  sees  conscious  political  control  shaping  human  destiny, rather than impersonal economic forces. The market economy is a value in itself:  as  Milt  on  Friedman  has  made  explicit,  the  free  market  promotes  a 'largely free society'. 10 Lurking behind 'free market' analyses are ideological preferences.

Reliance  on  the  market  is  an unlikely and  undesirable  strategy to coordinate  factors  of  production  and  to  improve  productivity  and  labour efficiency in the USSR. This is for three main reasons: experience of market societies  has  led  western  governments  to  intervene  to  promote  public welfare,  the  ideological  mental  set  of  the  Soviet  leadership  is  alien  to  the market and the Communist Party will maintain its political control.

## Systemic Contradictions

A third  explanation  of  the  present  labour  situation  is  in  terms  of  systemic contradictions. Writers adopting this stance reject the assertion that the high levels of labour utilization are an intended result of planning. Planners, they argue, have little control over recruitment and labour supply. They have been unable to eradicate labour shortage and 'unemployment on the job', and their

attempts  at  increasing  labour  productivity  have  not  been  successful.  The working of the economic mechanism in socialist states leads to shortages not only  of  labour  but  also  of  other  goods;  a  feature  of  the  system  is  its incapacity to supply commodities in relation to effective demand. Concurrently, resources are not efficiently used-labour and capital are underutilized. The operation of the economy is seen as the unintended consequences  of  individuals'  and  institutions'  actions.  Such  writers  would seek independent laws of a socialist economy in the same way as western economists and sociologists assume that capitalist economies have their own internal  logic  leading  to  depression  and  under-utilization  of  resources-p articularly, labour unemployment.

It  is  important  to  stress  that  the  socialist  economy  operates  in  quite  a different political, administrative and ideological environment and consequently  the  laws  or  processes  of  capitalist  economies  cannot  be applied.  The  major  differences  may  be  itemized  as  follows:  (1)  public ownership and planning give the socialist government a greater role over the economy  and  a  responsibility  to  provide  work  for  the  citizen;  (2)  the ideological constraints make chronic unemployment an unacceptable economic and political  cost;  (3)  demand  and  supply  are  not  responsive  to price as in capitalist economies; hence in the absence of significant structural change,  'freeing'  the  price  system,  in  the  sense  of  making  it  more  like  a western  market  one,  will  not  resolve  the  pathologies  of  the  labour  market noted above. In such a system a labour shortage concurrent with underemployment at the workplace is a systemic contradiction: it is, to quote Kornai, a 'consequence of the economic mechanism and of the institutional framework'. 11 This  school  of  economists  does  not  make  any  normative pronouncements  about  reform  of  the  system;  rather  it  is  concerned  in  a behavioural sense to expose the operation of the economy. 12

Janos Kornai is the best-known exponent of this approach. 13 He contrasts a 'resource-constrained' market for labour in socialist states with a 'demandconstrained' one under capitalism. The demand for labour is determined by the  supply,  the  plan  for  labour  is  based  on  the  forecast  of  employment constraints. 14 The plan consumes all available labour in the forecast which creates  a  shortage  of  labour. The  system  has  an  'investment  hunger'  which uses  resources  and  labour  reserves. 15 Employers,  to  counter  this  deficit, inflate their demands for labour as expressed in their planned estimates. This in turn leads to 'unemployment on the job': 'the more frequent and intensive

the  labour  shortage,  the  greater  will  be  the  internal  slack,  namely  the unemployment on the job.' 16

Effects of the labour shortage are the loosening of labour discipline, the deterioration  of  work  quality  and  the  lessening  of  workers'  diligence.  The security of employment gives rise to irresponsibility in anyone susceptible to it. Absenteeism exacerbates the shortage. Output becomes erratic and supply of commodities and services falls short of demand. Deficits characterize the wholesale market. Insuffici encies of supplies, materials and services in tum lead  to  slackness  on  the  job, 17 creating  'storming'  when  they  become available. Securing ample labour reserves, therefore, is a logical response by employers  to  meet  their  output  targets.  This  hoarding  tendency  in  turn increases the labour shortage and unemployment on the job making a vicious circle.

Kornai rejects the view that a policy of full employment may be explained solely in terms of government policy in socialist states: 'It is true that much depends  on  employment  policy.  .  .  yet  an  explanation  of  the  process.  .  . depends on considerations deeper than mere government policy. It follows necessarily  from  the system; for  if  the  system  is  resource-constrained,  an almost  unlimited  hunger  and  expansion  drive must prevail  and  then  the potential reserve labour must be absorbed sooner or later.' 18

It is when Kornai comes to analyse the political and social framework that his  explanation  is  inadequate.  He  points  out  that  the  tolerance  level  of employment is a 'social phenomenon'. 19 Once 'given', only marginal changes are  pos  sible.  Unemployment,  he  argues,  cannot  fall  much  below  the minimum level caused by 'friction'. Employment, he notes, is not just work for a wage but is 'a way of life'. 20 Hence in socialist states, there is no fear of 'genuine'  unemployment,  only  fluctuations  around  the  normal  participation rate. 21 He  asserts  that  the  state  of  the  labour  market  has  changed  pe rmanently under socialism-the beha viour of sellers of labour is 'characterized by guaranteed employment'. 22 There is a 'control mechanism that drives [the] system . . . back to a normal state following deviation from it'. 23 Having  dismissed  the  explanation  of  full  employment  as  being  due 'solely to a description of government policy measures', he insists that it be traced to 'intrinsic social forces'. 24 It is precisely here that Komai's argument is  lacking.  While  he  makes  reference  in  a  general  way  to  the  institutional framework,  he  does not analyse the relationship between  polity and

economy. 25 Kornai emphasizes that 'definite social relations and institutional conditions  generate  definite  forms  of  behaviour,  economic  regularities  and norms'. 26 His focus is on the forces operating on the industrial enterprise and in  the  economic  sphere,  yet  he  lacks  a  macro-analysis  of  what  shapes  'the forces  operating  on  the  enterprise'  and  determining  the  nature  of  the economy  which  give  rise  to  'shortage'.  The  role  of  values,  the  nature  of exchange between economy  and  polity, and the legitimation process involving loyalty and solidarity are not dealt with in his work. It is precisely these are as, however, that shape expectations and are powerful constraints on  the  operation  of  the  economy.  It  is  to  this  wider  social  and  political framework that I now turn.

## A Sociological Approach

Whilst  Kornai  and  others  argue  that  employment  and  labour  shortage  are systemic  characteristics  of  state  socialism,  their  accounts  lack  analysis  in terms  of  the  social  system.  They  describe  the  economic  mechanism,  but evade the societal and political dimensions. One reason for this, I suspect, is that Marxism is a systemic theory of society and in state socialist societies, a legitimating  ideology.  If  the  traditional  Marxist  model  is  brought  into question  by  having  insufficient  power  to  explain  the  operation  of  the economy, then its role as a legitimating ideology is cast in doubt. Also, if the 'economic  mechanism'  is  at  the  root  of  the  inefficiencies  of  the  system (rather than political institutions and ideological preferences) then economic reform  is  required  to  put  things  right  (as  opposed  to  systemic  changes  in power,  property  and  ideological  relations).  In  addition,  economists  by training have insufficient interest in, and knowledge of, theories of society, rather  than  models  of  the  economy.  When  economic  models  break  down, which  they  must  do  when  applied  to  activity  beyond  their  frame  of reference, analysis relies on making discrete observations.

An  attempt  will  be  made  here  to  develop  a  sociological  model  of  the socialist  labour  market  which  may  also  be  applied  to  other  aspects  of  the economy. Full employment has to be explained in terms of values, forms of political and social integration, the fusion of politics and economics, as well

as  through the processes of the economy. The objective is to highlight the exchanges between the economy and its social and political environment.

The framework of societal analysis suggested by Talcott Parsons may be utilized.  This  involves  four  analytically  distinct  subsystems  of  society:  (1) the economy, (2) the polity, (3) the societal community, and (4) the cultural system. The economy needs little comment: it is concerned with production and distribution of commodities and services, labour is the major resource which  turns  natural  objects  into  use-values.  The polity's functions  are  to make decisions for the mobilization of resources, for the definition, making and  attainment  of  society's  goals.  The societal  community has  to  do  with maintaining social control and integration including norms, law and coercion.  The  integration  system  has  the  role  of  coordinating  the  various parts of the system. The cultural system represents the goals which motivate people in society, and these are derived from the overriding values. The four sub-systems  may  be  illustrated  by  four  boxes  designated  by  the  letters  A (adaptation),  G  (goal-attainment),  I  (integration),  L  (latency)  (see  Figure 9.1).

Figure 9.1 Dimensions of society

<!-- image -->

These analytical categories apply to all societies. Complex exchanges take place  between these four sub-systems. But various societies have different ways  of  making  such  exchanges.  First,  I  shall  consider  the  interchanges described by Parsons which characterize a market system (he has in mind the USA); and second, I shall suggest how this model may be applied to socialist societies.  From  economic  analysis,  the  notion  of  a  moving  equilibrium  is

applied to adjustments which continually happen. Parsons has described his scheme  as  one  of  'the  analysis  of  dynamic  equilibriating  processes'.  (He notes, however, that equilibrium under capitalism does not always occurexceptions are hyper-inflation and chronic shortages; wars, slumps and mass unemployment  may  also  be  added.)  Exchange  takes  place  between  these systems  in  a  way  analogous  to  an  economic  model  consisting  of  inputs (factors  of  production)  and  outputs  (products)  between  each  system.  Links are  established  between  the  sub-systems  through  different  media.  Money serves as a medium for the economy, power for the polity, influence for the integrative subsystem and commitments  for  the cultural system. The principles governing the four systems are: integrity (for the value system), solidarity  (for  the  integrative  system),  effectiveness  (for  the  polity)  and efficiency (for the economy).

Figure 9.2 Systems of society

<!-- image -->

Figure  9.2  summarizes  these  exchanges  and  illustrates  the  appropriate media.  There  are  six  systemic  sets  of  exchanges  which  characterize  all

societies. (The detailed categories are shown in Parsons.) 27 Under capitalism,  the  labour  consumption  market  system  (the  L-A  exchange)  is distinguished  by  an  exchange  of  labour  capacity  (work)  for  wage  income: money,  used  to  purchase  commodities,  is  the  essence  of  the  individual's commitment to work. 28  In  other  words,  motivation  to  work  is  satisfied  by wage  income.  The  resource  mobilization  system  (A-G)  is  maintained through exchanges of money and power. The polity maintains the conditions for  effectiveness,  it  controls  the  level  of  credit  and  the  price  of  money (interest),  the  level  of  capital  investment  is  determined  by  the  polity.  The economy in return maintains productivity and thereby increases the level of goods available  to  the  collectivity.  The  allocative  standard  system  (A-I)  is concerned with the assertion of claims to resources by the economy against standards for such allocation. The integration of society requires that claims have  to  be  prioritized;  entrepreneurial  activity  plays  an  important  role  in innovation.  The  loyalty/solidarity/commitment  system  (the  L-I  exchange) expresses  the  exchange  between  values  and  integration.  The  beliefs  in property,  private  enterprise  and  individualism  are  given  by  the  overriding value  system  and  they  ensure  solidarity.  The  legitimation  system  (G-L) summarizes the exchange between the polity and values. The terms of the legitimation of activity in western society are expressed through democratic procedures  in  the  polity,  and  private  ownership  of  economic  enterprises. Political  loyalty  is  ensured  when  these  conditions  are  met.  Loyalty  is  a necessary condition for the effectiveness of the polity, which in turn ensures its role in mobilizing resources (G-A) and contributes to solidarity (G-I).

This  concludes  my  brief  exposition  of  the  Parsonian  model  of  the economy under capitalism. As far as the economy is concerned, a few salient points  may  be  highlighted:  individual  motivation  for  work  is  provided  by wages; demand is superior to supply; priorities and budgeting are controlled through allocations of money in return for productivity. Such exchanges are performed  through  differentiated  institutions,  money  is  a  crucial  unit  of account and medium of exchange.

Exchanges in Socialist States

These  types  of  exchanges  do  not  occur  in  socialist  states.  The  chief differences may be itemized as follows (1) The values involving motivational commitments are different. 'Commodity demand' is not a prime motivational  force  under  planning.  (2)  'Wage  income'  in  return  for  labour capacity does not have the same salience, as moral duty and psychological satisfaction are also considered to be motivating factors for work. Motivational commitment to labour is in moral and legal as well as financial terms. (3) In Parsons' scheme, affecting all the exchanges in and out of 'A', is the role played by the medium of money. The budget constraints in social ist societies  are  extremely  weak,  money  is  a  unit  of  account  but  it  is  not  a medium  of  exchange  as  under  capitalism.  (4)  Forms  of  legitimacy  and authority  are  derived  from  the  ideology  of  Marxism  -  Leninism  and  the Communist  Party.  (5)  Production  is  not  responsive  to  price,  and  price  is insensitive  to  demand;  this  is  the  case  in  all  commodity  markets.  (6) 'Inefficiencies'  are  characteris  tic  of  the  economy  and  have  become  an accepted way of life. (7) The economy is publicly owned, it is organized and planned by administr ative  bodies. The  allocation  of  resources  takes  place through  administrative  channels  rather  than  a  market.  (8)  There  is  no entrepreneurship in the sense of individuals marketing products or services in exchange for profit. (9) Flows of money (credit) and interest rates do not influence investment or production; accumulation of money does not lead to investment.  (10)  There  is  no  pay  ment  for  risk  (profit)  and  there  is  no bankruptcy.

In conceptualizing the role of the economy in a socialist society, however, Parsons'  insights  should  be  retained  as  a  framework.  It  must  be  conceded that  all  societies  have  four  functional  dimensions,  and  differentiated  ones need  to  have  forms  of  exchange  to  maintain  equilibrium.  Compared  to market-type societies, plann ed ones of the Soviet type have a deceptively simple appearance. The  main  structural difference is the absence of differentiated institutions having relative autonomy. The Communist Party as an  institution  appears  to  be  omnicompetent  and  in  practice  the  functions defined above are not the concern of differentiated institutions. The 'inputs', 'outputs'  and  media  are  dissimilar  in  capitalist  and  socialist  societies.  The motivational  commitment  system  is  derived  from  the  value  system  of Marxism-Leninism, though money and status for the individual also have a role.  Integration  through  planning,  law  and  education  seeks  to  secure  the values  of  the  dominant  Communist  Party:  harmony  is  sought  through  the

notion of a classless society. (The complicating effects of tradition al values, procedures  and  norms  are  excluded  here,  though  I  have  discussed  them elsewhere.) 29 Efficiency and effectiveness, the motivating values of capitalism,  have  less  salience  than  those  of  integrity  (of  ideology)  and solidarity.

The  socialist  system  (see  Figure  9.3)  has  some  notable  differences compared to the capitalist. Parsons has made clear that American society has

economic productivity. The collective goals of a Marxist-Leninist party are comprehensive.  Motivational  commitments  stemming  from  values  include full  employment  and  social  welfare  (the  L-I  exchange).  'Commitments'  as media out of L are retained in this model. The exchange with the economy (I-A) involves a commitment to maximum production of goods and services: goals  are  defined  in  terms  of  supply,  rather  than  commodity  demand,  as under capitalism. This has important implications for the conduct of affairs at enterprises: plans are fulfilled in output terms, rather than efficiency ones. The medium of coordination at I under capitalism is 'influence'; in socialist societies  planning  exerts  power-like  sanctions.  Administratively  ordered plans  characterize  the  I-A  exchange,  rather  than  entrepreneurship  and  the influence of the interest rate as in market societies. Legitimation of authority (L-G)  comes  from  public  ownership  and  the  expression  of  class  interests which  in  turn  have  been  derived  from  the  value  system  of  MarxismLeninism. The economy is not a market-linked network of competing firms, but  a  system  of  enterprises  controlled  by  Ministries  which  in  turn  are subordinate  to  the  polity  and  the  societal  community  (I).  Money  is  still  a medium  out  from  A  and  wages  are  products  which  fulfil  motivational commitments (A-L). However, money is not a means for accumulation and income in kind (social services, subsidies) reduces its potency; work is also regarded as a moral need and social duty. The polity penalizes those who do not  work  and  by  the  same  token  the  integration  system  prioritizes  the provision of jobs. Goods are measured in monetary terms (A-G), but prices do not reflect scarcity. Claims to resources are expressed in financial terms (money is a unit of account), but capital markets do not allocate resources (it is not a medium of exchange).

The exchanges from G are determined by the medium of power. The Party apparatus is particularly important in aggregating plans for the allocation of resources (in line with its interpretation of the community's needs). Priorities in allocation  of  resources  to  the  economy  are  specified  by  G  (G-A). Responsibility for employees' interests (G-L) are shared by Party and trade unions, in the context of public ownership  and  planning.  The  Party leadership combines the allocation of resources with leadership in management (G-I).

The outputs from I differ considerably from capitalist states. Parsons has in mind 'influence' in the sense of 'constituent demands' 30 (I-G). In socialist states  these  demands  are  often  suppressed.  Under  American  capitalism,

Parsons  describes  an  action  sequence  of  interest-demands  →  leadership responsibility → policy decisions → political support. (This is analogous to a  perfect  competition  model  of  the  economic  market  in  which  demand stimulates  supply.)  In  socialist  states,  interest  demands  do not 'define  the situation  for  political  decision-making',  as  postulated  by  Parsons.  Political support is sought, but it is not crucial to leadership. The legitimation system gives the polity authority to achieve general goals, irrespective of political support in a western electoral sense. The 'assertion to claims on resources' may not be reciprocated in the allocation of claims (I-A exchange). Claims may not be met. Shortages of commodities may ensue (i.e. the production of goods  and  services  A-G  may  not  coincide  with  the  definition  of  outputs expressed  at  I).  Ideology  legitimates  societal  integration  in  terms  of  a classless  society  and  the  meeting  of  needs;  market  systems  fulfil  wants  in terms of consumer demands which in turn may violate norms of equality and fraternity. Shortages  may  be  a  source  of  'strain'  (I-L)  but,  as  Kornai concedes,  shortages  are  an  accepted  part  of  life  (as  inflation  is  under capitalism)  and  do  not  have  serious  destabilizing  effects.  Consensus  is maintained through a combination of social and welfare benefits coupled to the provision of employment in the context of a low productivity economy. The welfare state and full employment are linchpins in the loyalty/solidarity/commitment system and the political support system.

## The Fusion of Political and Economic

The  organization  of  political  and  economic  institutions  in  the  USSR  has important  effects  on  policies.  In  socialist  societies  there  has  been  no  clear institutional division between the economic and the political. In any society, the costs of economic efficiency in political terms may be measured in the weakening of public loyalty and social solidarity. But the accepted division in capitalist society between economics and politics diverts responsibility for unemployment  away  from  the  formal  arena  of  politics.  Unemployment  is legitimated in the West as being necessary for economic efficiency. Policies to  reduce  unemployment  do  so  in  the  context  of  maintaining  efficiency. Invariably they involve financial compensation for the loss of work but do not make the provision of employment a major policy goal.

In  the  USSR  the  greater  fusion  of  politics  and  economics  and  the responsibility the state assumes for public welfare make it impossible for the government to ignore the social and political costs of economic change. If unemployment were to be a consequence of economic policy, its cost could not be shouldered by the working class, as the Party claims that the Soviet state  is  the  expression  of  the  interests  of  that  class.  The  hegemony  of  the political over the economic in the USSR ensures the priority of loyalty and solidarity  over  economic  efficiency  and  this  entails  a  full  employment policy.

The implication for policy and reform is that a reliance on market wage stimulation  will  not  be  effective  unless  the  ideological  priorities  are  also changed. Values, however, are notoriously difficult to alter. The role of the polity  is  to  release  resources  to  maximize  output.  This  is  ensured  by  the public  ownership  of  the  means  of  production  and  planning  (the  authoritylegitimation  system).  The  nature  of  the  political  support  system  is  also different  from  that  under  capitalism.  The  polity  is  much  more  strongly anchored  under  the  domination  of  the  political  party.  Political  support  is certainly  necessary,  but  there  are  few  checks  on  leadership  for  'effective management'. This may weaken solidarity and consensus. However, this is compensated  by  the  stabilizing  effects  of  full  employment  and  social security. Unlike under capitalism, where the allocation of resources and the need  for efficiency leads to employment  uncertainty,  under  socialism efficiency in the economy is sacrificed for solidarity. And unlike in capitalist market societies where the amount of credit and the levels of interest may depress economic activities, in socialist societies it is the 'allocative standard system' that has been weakly developed. Administrative control of claims to resources is weak in face of the power to invest sanctioned by the polity. The loyalty/  solidarity/commitment  system  is  predicated  on  the  creation  of  a classless  society.  The  standards  of  allocation  are  in  terms  of  maintaining loyalty:  full  employment  is  a  priority  rather  than,  as  under  capitalism,  the striving for efficiency in the economy. It is in this sense that full employment is part of government policy. It would not be impossible to reduce the level of  labour  utilization  and  increase  unemployment  in  the  USSR.  But  the economic processes leading to present overemployment are not countered by the government because political values stress the importance of work and occupation: loyalty and solidarity are politically dependent on full employment.

Kornai  and  other  commentators  who  argue  for  a  'systemic'  analysis  of socialist societies are correct in their general standpoint. My own approach has sought to outline the fact that full employment is systemic because it is closely  linked  (a)  to  the  loyalty/solidarity  system,  (b)  to  motivational commitments,  (c)  to  a  supply  resourced  economy,  and  (d)  to  an  outputmaximization and politically determined resources allocation system. 'Shortages'  are  likely  to  be  a  consequence  of  such  a  system  because integration is not fulfilled through the satisfaction of 'demands'. Any major change in the system of motivational commitments and integration processes would lead to  the  breakdown  of  the  complex  sets  of  institutional  interests and exchanges. This would have to include greater individual sovereignty, an enhanced  role  to  'influence',  the  strengthening  of  standards  of  allocation involving the use of money as a medium-as a criterion of investment. A thorough use of the price system (affecting wages, capital and commodities) would destroy the present complicated sets of exchanges established under state socialism.

One can also look at the social system in another way-by consideration of group interests. The legitimating ideology can only be effective in terms of a social policy of full employment if there are dominant and subordinate groups in support of it, or at least, if the balance of political interests favours it.  Compared  to  western  capitalism,  a  wide  range  of  groups  in  the  USSR endorse a full employment policy.

## Interests Promoting Full Employment

Three main interests promote full employment under socialism: management, labour and Party. By contrast, in a market system, management is  under  pressure  to  cut  labour  costs  to  compete  more  effectively.  Poor market  performance  leads  to  a  decline  of  profits,  possible  takeover  and bankruptcy. There is little financial cost involved in creating redundancy, the costs of unemployment are social costs which are not borne by the firm. In command economies, however, management has no incentive to shed labour. The more labour resources it has available, the better it can meet its output targets. Enterprises are not subject to bankruptcy or takeover. Surplus labour not only helps management to overcome production bottlenecks, but the size

of  the  labour  force  is  also  a  criterion  of  management's  earnings.  The ministerial apparatus superior to the enterprise also has plans to fulfil and, recognizing the  need  for  'slack',  will  not  push  for  greater  efficiency  at  the cost of supply uncertainty. Surplus labour is a social cost, not a financial one to the enterprise or ministry.

Labour itself is tar more homogeneous than in the West. Trade unions do not  have  the  power  to  bargain  on  behalf  of  privileged  groups  of  workers (such  as  printers,  or  doctors  of  medicine).  There  is  no  impetus  from organized  labour  in  the  USSR  to  break  out  of  a  low-pay  economy,  or  to increase pay differentials. Unemployment resulting from labour costs being kept artificially high, as a result of union activity, does not occur. The masses of employed  people have good reason to fear the consequences of unemployment. Many of the older workers have neither the motivation nor education  to  acquire  new  skills  forced  by  technological  change  and  they would be likely to suffer reduction of wages and status. Any prolonged form of  unemployment  would,  in  the  absence  of  social  security  benefit,  cause poverty. It is likely that labour, at the levels of the factory Party and trade union committees, as well the rank-and-file worker, favours a policy of full employment at the expense of economic efficiency.

The  Communist  Party  as  a  political  agency  has  no  incentive  to  allow unemployment  to  develop.  Any  threat  of  mass  unemployment,  let  alone public  disturbances  as  have  occurred  in  Poland,  would  weaken  the  Party's authority and would bring into question the USSR as a socialist state. The police and security services have a stronger voice in government decisionmaking than in advanced western states. Their concern with the prevention of public disorder also encourages a full-employment policy, as witnessed by campaigns  instigated  by  Andropov  against  parasitism  and  their  explicit views that unemployment causes crime (see above p. 57).

Another  way  of  putting  it  is  that  certain  groups'  interests  are  met  by present  policy  which  would  be  undermined  by  a  'market-type'  economic reform.  The  present  system  of  planning  gives  the  Party  and  government leadership prerogatives over the allocation of resources that would pass to 'the  market'.  A  market-type  system  would  not  only  diminish  the  political power of the economic Ministries and Party, but would be likely to divert resources to consumption and away from defence and welfare. A weakening of  the  right  to  employment  would  be  opposed  and  feared  by  the  mass  of rank-and-file Party members and qualms about the effects of labour unrest

(in  a  social  ist  society)  are  strong  enough  for  the  Party  leadership  to  give priority to the maintenance of loyalty on the part of the working population albeit at the expense of economic ef ficiency.

## Sources of Change

The command economy described above is under pressure to change. The maturation of the economic, political and social system, its greater diversity, complexity and size, requires modification to the sets of exchanges described  above.  The  Soviet  Union  has  had  a  turbulent  political  history reflected in high levels of political insecurity and oppression during the time of Stalin. The instability associated with post-revolutionary regimes has led the political authorities to give priority to the maintenance of the solidarity system, and to channel resources into economic growth and defence. As B.P. Kurashvili has put it, historically the development of production relations in the USSR required the predominance of common (as opposed to individual) interests, it  required direct state management and the disposal of resources by the state. 31 This has involved the hegemony  of  the polity with administrative control located at G (see Figure 9.3 above). Political power (P) has been the dominant medium of control with little use of other mediain terms of money (M), influence (I), commitment (C).

The  greater  political,  social  and  economic  maturity  of  the  USSR  has created  the  basis  for  greater  diversity  and  the  necessity  for  exchange. Reforms  call  for  a  greater  role  to  be  given  to  money,  influence  and commitment.  The  higher  levels  of  differentials  and  the  rise  of  articulate interests  on  the  part  of  various  occupational  groups  in  the  USSR  has  been noted  by  Kurashvili  and  by  Zaslavskaya.  The  latter  has  called  for  greater open  debate  about  priorities  and  has  called  for  greater  'flexibility'  and 'democracy'. 32 In  terms  of  my  model  this  involves  the  formalization  of exchanges  between  G/I  (the  nature  of  effective  leadership  and  political support),  A/L  (commitment  to  production  through  satisfaction  and  wages and production of goods and services), L/G (the relationship between public ownership and planning and employees' interests) and All (a realignment of claims to resources and outputs of economic plans). As noted in Figure 9.3 interchanges through the media of money, influence and commitment occur

between economy, polity, society and cultural system. Zaslavska ya summed up the problem when she pointed out that the USSR's productive forces have changed significantly from the 1930s when the economic mechanism was set up, what  is  now  necessary  is  making  'a  rational  calculation  between administrative and economic methods of management under new conditions'. 33

In  the  1980s,  the  Soviet  Union  has  a  different  order  of  priorities. These have  been  explicitly  articulated  by  the  leadership  of  Gorbachev.  They involve a greater concern with efficiency and quality of life. There are also exogenous pressures: the need to adopt new technology to match the West's military  effort, the  greater  awareness  by  Soviet  citizens  of  the  living standards in advanced capitalist countries and the relative underachievement of the Soviet economy in relation to them.

Gorbachev's policy reflects the initiative of professional groups ('specialists') with a vision of a different type of society-one more able to compete  with  the  economic  advance  of  the  West;  one  more  differentiated with  greater  individual  choice  and  uncertainty;  one  in  which  change  is institutionalized in the socioeconomic system. It involves greater 'flexibility' on the part of the workforce, entail ing more job changing and a weakening of job tenure; it involves greater autonomy for work units (brigades) and for the industrial enterprise. Groups  advocating  these  changes  have  been discussed above: they are made up of 'reformers' in government and Party hierarchies and particularly in academic institutes, especially in the Academy of Sciences.

They  take  their  cues  for  change  from  the  practice  of  the  West  and  the policies adopted in other socialist countries, such as Hungary. 34 They have the support of the younger, better qualified workers and professionals who will be able to compete and excel under a system encouraging initiative and independence. Such people are more 'consumer-oriented' and desire a higher quality standard of living. This policy, however, involves greater inequality in the distribution of resources and greater income differentials. It is a policy in favour  of  the  strong-those  who  can  compete  successfully.  Market principles  and  contractual  relations,  as  advocated  by  Aganbegy  an, 35 for instance, would be part of such a policy.

In  terms  of  my  model,  the  polity  and  economy  have  to  become  more differentiated to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The resource mobilization system and the labour consumption system inherited from the

period  of  rapid  economic  growth  and  political  consolidation  are  now inappropriate.  As  Gorbachev  puts  it:  'The  specific  economic  and  political situation  we  are  in,  and  the  particular  period  of  the  historical  process  that Soviet  society  .  .  .  [is]  going  through  require  that  the  Party  and  every member  of  it  display  their  creativity,  capacity  for  innovation  and  skill  to transcend the framework of habitual but already outdated notions.' Later in his speech Gorbachev made explicit: The forms of production relations, the system  of  running  and  managing  the  economy  .  .  .  took  shape  .  .  .  in  the conditions  of  an  extensive  development  of  the  economy.  Gradually  they become obsolete,  they  began  to  lose  their  role  as  incentives  and  here  and there they turned into impediments. Currently we are striving to change the thrust of the economic mechanism, to overcome its costintensive nature, to target it towards enhancing quality and efficiency, accelerating the progress of  science  and  technology  and  the  strengthening  of  the  role  played  by  the human factor. 36

Communism is not only an ethic of work and industrial development, but it also aspires to the provision of abundance in terms of goods and services. In  the  contemporary  Soviet  Union,  there  is  a  peculiar  combination  of socialist welfare objectives and a growing western-style consumerism. The more demanding population seeks better forms of services and commodities, as well as more significant forms of participation and the use of non-working time.  Pushed  both  by  the  need  to  keep  up  with  the  West  and  by  a  more urbane  and  demanding  younger  generation,  the  political  leadership  of  the USSR will move policy in the direction of greater efficiency. Inefficiency is not legitimated by Marxism; it is not a virtue of a planned economy.

Economic  reform  will  probably  lead  to  greater  differentiation  of  the political and the economic and to a greater stress on efficiency. The greater emphasis on economizing (and an improvement in quality) is brought out by the slogan: 'Pace, quality, thrift and organization'. 37 The role of money wili be enhanced. Gorbachev has called for restructuring of the economy and for a  critical  examination  of  the  relationship  between  'goods  and  money'.  In discuss ing the organization of agriculture, Gorbachev pointed out: 'The role of  financial  autonomy  will  be  raised  significantly,  its  final  results  must become  the  norm  for  all  links  in  the  agro  industrial  complex.  .  .  .  The practice  of  bank  credit  must  be  substantially  altered  so  that  it  provides incentives to raising the level of activity of collective and state farms.' 38

Gorbachev calls for a 'radical reform' in economic management to raise 'efficiency  and  quality,  to  speed  up  scientific  and  technical  progress,  to develop  the  workers'  interest  in  the  results  of  their  work  and  develop initiatives  in  a  socialist  sense  of  enterprise  in  each  unit  of  the  national economy and primarily in labour collectives.' Economic enterprises will be given greater autonomy: 'Enterprises and organizations should be given the right to market above-plan output, unused raw and manufactured materials and equipment and so on, independently. . . . It is finally time to put an end to the practice of petty tutelage of enterprises on the part of Ministries and Departments. . . . Ministries should concentrate on issues of technical policy, balance  within  industries  and  satisfying  the  requirements  of  the  national economy  for  high  quality  output  from  their  industries.' 39 The  task  of enterprises is 'to react responsively to the demands of consumers'. 40

The exchanges between economy and the motivational system (the L-A exchange) will be strengthened in the form of exchanging money for goods and services. 'It is necessary for the size of an enterprise's wages fund to be directly tied to revenues from the sales of their products. . . We can no longer reconcile  ourselves  to  the  fact  that  the  workers  of  enterprises  producing useless products are . . . receiving . . . in full, both their wages and bonuses and other benefits.' 41

I pointed out above that a market system could not effectively be grafted on to the present political order unless a change in values also occurred. The mobilizing principle of 'social justice' is likely to be used to legitimate the shifting  of  resources  from  administrative  control  to  the  market.  M.  N. Rutkevich 42 has  pointed  to  the  fact  that  the  proportion  of  real  income  for manual and non-manual workers received through public consumption funds has increased from 25.2 per cent in 1960 to 28.9 per cent in 1984, and the proportion  received  by  collective  farmers  has  correspondingly  risen  more quickly-from  10.3  per  cent  to  19.2  per  cent.  Rutkevich  argues  that  the principle  of  'payment  according  to  one's  work'  should  be  applied  in  this arena. He points out that income transfers through public consumption lead to  inequality.  Subsidies  for  the  upkeep  of  certain  activities  (e.g.  theatres, clubs,  libraries)  benefit  some  people  irrespective  of  their  contribution  to society.  He  argues-rather  like  opponents  of  the  welfare  state  in  western countries-that a minimum level should be provided by the government and that  people  should  pay  for  themselves  above  this. This  would  involve,  for instance, progressively higher rents for more desirable accommodation and

housing.  Charges  would  be  introduced  for  certain  kinds  of  educational courses (foreign languages, typing, music).  The  provision of medical services and other welfare services varies according to the place of work of an  employee.  This  form  of  injustice,  according  to  such  writers,  could  be remedied by allowing more people to buy these services on the market In this  way  real  income  would  be  shifted  from  payments  in  kind  to  money income which would be an 'incentive  for  increasing  the  labour  activity  of personnel and labour collectives'. It might further be argued that the 'defence of workers' interests' would be weakened with a movement to market type bargaining: trade unions under capitalism have experience of wage bargaining unknown in socialist countries where their tasks have traditionally been mainly integrative.

Such  views,  however,  have  to  be  implemented  in  the  context  of  the legitimating  principle  that  people  under  socialism  give  according  to  their abilities.  Furthermore there is an implication in Marxist ideology that with the development of the material basis of communism, people should receive 'according to their needs', rather than to 'their deserts' as the market would reward them. T. Zaslavskaya has addressed this concept in relation to social justice. 43 Here  Zaslavskaya  argues  that  a  socialist  state  has  to  'create  the optimal conditions for the full-fledged social development of each person'. This calls for greater state provision to enable all children to enjoy relatively equal  starting  conditions  to  develop  their  abilities.  The  unequal  access  to higher  education  by  higher  social  groups  and  the  unequal  distribution  of cultural  resources  (between  urban  and  rural)  entail  greater  collective  pro vision. Zaslavskaya advocates that 'a substantial portion of the expense. of raising children  should  be  placed  on  the  state'. By  adjusting  welfare payments  in  this  way,  a  more  equitable  level  of  well-being  would  be achieved by raising the standards of families with many dependent children. The distribution of occupations is such that in many localities it is impossi ble to match the potential of people to jobs available (in some rural school s most girls become milk-maids). The supply of jobs should be organized to fulfil human aspirations. This procedure is again contrary to the development of a western-type free labour market and is in opposition to the ideology of many of the economically-oriented reformers.

The  'acceleration'  of  social  change  in  the  1980s  will,  in  the  sphere  of labour, lead to redeployment of the labour force at a much greater rate than hitherto. Both Gorbachev and Kostakov have estimated that from 12 to 19

million existing jobs will be lost through the intensive development of the economy. 44 The  need  for  greater  efficiency  to  maintain  higher  levels  of output, however, is unlikely to lead to structural unemployment. The supply of jobs is already inflated, the length of the working week may be reduced, and the system of planning is able to ensure the provision of sufficient jobs at a macro-level to accommodate the labour force.

It is likely that the need for efficiency will lead to some weakening of the principle  of  solidarity.  However,  for  reasons  adumbrated  above,  a  fullemployment policy under present conditions of planning will continue, albeit at the cost of economic inefficiency. Some market features are likely to be adopted. Policy will mitigate the worst effects of underemployment. Changes are likely to involve greater administrative control over the number of  workers'  places,  a  tightening  of  the  wages  fund,  greater  incentives  for management and workers to make surplus labour redundant, the lifting of the responsibility from enterprises to find work for redundant workers, greater reliance  on  labour  exchanges  to  place  them  in  new  jobs  and  finally,  the payment  of  wages  for  extended  periods  to  workers  made  redundant.  A distinction between job security and full employment will be made entailing the weakening of the former and the maintenance of the latter. One is likely to  have  a  situation  of  full  employment  at  the  macro-level  with  greater  job insecurity at the micro-level.

As I have illustrated on Figure 9.3, state socialism as a social system does not have the same kinds of reciprocated exchanges as under capitalism. It is possible, however,  for reciprocated exchanges  to develop  under  state socialism  and  to  enhance  its  efficiency  and  effectiveness. Within-system reform will entail an increased role to money: as a medium of exchange for commitment (the A-L exchange), for the production of goods and services (the A-G exchange). The system of motivational values (MarxismLeninism),  types  of  integration  and  political  priorities  (planning  and  Party hegemony) require modernization-being brought up-to-date in a world of a consumer society and high technology. The problem for the Soviet leadership  is  to  decide  what  kinds  of  policy  are  consistent  with  a  Marxist framework  of  motivational  values,  patterns  of  integration  and  socialist management. Merely copying some elements of a market capitalist economy may  create  distortions  and  weaken  solidarity.  As  far  as  employment  and labour are concerned, the adoption of a western-type labour market would undermine  public  ownership  and  planning,  the  present  forms  of  social

integration, the legitimacy of the leading role of the Communist Party and it would  (intentionally)  weaken  the  bargaining  position  of  employees.  From the  point  of  view  of  practical  politics,  'economic  reform'  is  limited  by  the systemic properties (including the values) of the socialist system.  A movement  away  from  a  full-employment/low-wage  policy  would  have serious  destabilizing  consequences  for  the  present  political  system  and  the political leadership. Economic reform cannot simply copy western processes which are organically part of a different social and political infrastructure. Reform is likely to be piecemeal, to take place within the existing structures and procedures of planning.
