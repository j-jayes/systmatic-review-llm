## NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR

A History

Although the  inclusion  of  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  as  part  of Confederation is of national signifi  cance, it represents only a small portion of the province's past. Sean Cadigan has written a defi  nitive history of one of North America's most distinct and beautiful regions. The  site  of  the  continent's  fi  rst  European  settlement  one  thousand years ago and a former colony of England, this easternmost point of the continent has had a fascinating history in part because of its position as the gateway between North America and Europe. Examining the region from prehistoric times to the present, Newfoundland and Labrador is not only a comprehensive history of the province, but an illuminating portrait of the Atlantic world and of the European colonization of the Americas.

The  book  traces  the  major  developments  in  the  region's  history, from the fi  rst European settlements, the extinction of the indigenous Beothuk by European settlers, the confl  icts between settlers and the imperial government, to the Royal Newfoundland Regiment's near annihilation at the Battle of the Somme, the rise of Newfoundland nationalism, Joey Smallwood's case for confederation, and the economic disappointments that resulted after Confederation. Paying particular attention to the ways in which Newfoundland and Labrador's history has been shaped by its environment, this study considers how natural resources such as the Grand Banks, the cod fi  shery, and off-shore oil have affected the region and its inhabitants.

Written in an engaging and accessible style, Newfoundland and Labrador brings the rich and vibrant history of this remarkable region to life.

## Acknowledgments

Gerry Hallowell fi  rst  approached me in 1997 on behalf of the University of Toronto Press to write this history of Newfoundland and Labrador. I agreed to do so just before I learned that I was expecting my fi  rst daughter, Elizabeth. This touched off a chain of events, which although very rewarding from the perspective of family, led to many delays in producing this work. I dedicate this book to Elizabeth, to her younger sister Margaret, and to their mother and my partner Bonnie Morgan, who also read and provided advice on an early version.

I thank the University of Toronto Press for its patience, and I am particularly grateful to Len Husband, editor of Canadian history, for his advice and encouragement.

A number of people helped me by giving freely of their time and advice.  Alan  Macpherson, professor emeritus in the department of geography,  Memorial  University,  assisted  my  interpretation  of  the Norse in chapter two. Peter Sinclair,  department  of  sociology,  Memorial University, advised me on many aspects of the writing of this book and, more importantly, has been a steady source of friendship and  collaboration.  As  always,  Mark  Leier,  department  of  history, Simon  Fraser  University,  has  offered  good-humoured  counsel  and camaraderie.

Most important has been the advice and support of Rosemary Ommer, now the director of special projects, Offi  ce of the Vice-President Research, University of Victoria, who has been a mentor to me since my days as a graduate student.

## Introduction

## Scarce Environmental Leeway, Nationalism, and the Long Term in Newfoundland and Labrador

'We are not a nation,' declared J.R. Smallwood in his motion to send a Newfoundland delegation to Canada to discuss the possibility of union in 1946. Smallwood was not commenting on Newfoundland and Labrador's unique cultures or identities. Instead, he insisted that its small population, the relative underdevelopment of its economy, the poverty of its people in comparison with Canada, Britain, or the United States, its domination by the largely mercantile elite in St John's, and the failure of independent liberal democratic government to address any of these problems meant that Newfoundland and Labrador could not sustain itself economically and politically.  Yet, while Smallwood 1 acknowledged that Newfoundland and Labrador had not undergone the developments associated with successful economies elsewhere, he was unprepared to accept that the environmental circumstances of his country did not favour such a transformation. For thousands of years Newfoundland and Labrador's cold-ocean environment had supported relatively small-scale, local populations spread out along a vast littoral and heavily dependent on the harvest of marine animals such as cod, seals, and whales. There was little in this environment that could sustain the industrial and urban transformations that occurred elsewhere in North America and the British empire. Nonetheless, in their response  to  specifi  c  local,  colonial,  and  imperial  relationships  that governed the exploitation of marine resources, colonial leaders, by the late nineteenth century, had embraced a landward, often nationalist, policy of industrial development which ignored the basic ecological constraints that had defi  ned previous societies in Newfoundland

and  Labrador.  Smallwood's  vision  of  economic  development  was another  variety  of  this  commitment  to  landward  industrialization, which continued to neglect Newfoundland and Labrador's dependence on marine resources and the diverse needs of its many peoples. Like the policies of earlier colonial nationalists, Smallwood's efforts foundered on the stark reality of the province's fragile but unavoidable dependence on its maritime resources. While initially quite rich, these resources have provided scarce leeway in terms of how societies have used them in conjunction with landward resources. The story that follows is the story of those resources and the political, cultural, social, and economic responses of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador in a changing world.

Newfoundland and Labrador's rich maritime ecologies and comparatively impoverished land-based ones are the legacy of an ancient process which began over 500 million years ago. Tectonic forces in the  Earth's  crust  began  to  split  the  primordial  single  land  mass  of the planet into continents and ocean fl  oors. About 190 million years ago, land masses emerged with the basic shapes of the continents we know today, although they were much closer together. What became known as the Grand Banks was a massive continental shelf of what would become known as North America, as the land mass parted from what would become Europe and Africa (see map 1). Tectonic pressures constantly worked on this shelf, producing shelves adjacent to the land masses of Newfoundland and Labrador and sunken regions that, over about 50 million years, fi  lled with sediments. Within these sediments formed large reserves of oil, making the basins we know as Jeanne D'Arc, Orphan, and Whale the basis for offshore oil industry exploration and development.

The formation of the Grand Banks was one of two determining factors in the development of the ecologies of Newfoundland and Labrador. About 65 to 75 million years ago, shifts in the earth's crust formed what we now call the Labrador Sea, a trench between the continental shelf of North America and the shelf that incorporates the islands from Ireland to Greenland. The same process widened the shelves around Labrador and Newfoundland and produced corridors of deeper waters throughout the shelves and banks, which would become important migratory routes for fi  sh such as cod. After a fairly warm period, a cooling trend that extended from 40 to 50 million years ago made the waters around Newfoundland and Labrador 'a sparse and subarctic environment.' Although the area has experienced considerable variations, it has retained these essential characteristics to the present. 2

Although the continents continued to drift apart, and the Grand Banks continued to sink while sea levels rose, the banks remained a shallow shelf with a well-defi  ned edge. The banks formed a massive undersea barrier to the warm-water northerly fl  ows of the Gulf Stream, turning them eastward away from Newfoundland and Labrador. The northern edge of the banks diverted the southward icy fl  ow of the Labrador Current toward the southeast, where it runs into the Gulf Stream off the southeastern Grand Banks.

While the Grand Banks have profoundly infl  uenced the ecological circumstances of Newfoundland and Labrador, so too has the Labrador Current. The current has two branches. The fi  rst is the counter-clockwise  offshore  fl  ow  of  the  West  Greenland  Current  in  the Labrador Sea. This gyre mixes with, and brings northward, waters from the North Atlantic Current of the Gulf Stream off the southeastern Grand Banks. The second is the inshore stream that originates in the  polar  waters  of  the  Canadian  Current.  These  waters  fl  ow  from the Arctic Basin, picking up volumes from the freshwater drainage of Hudson and Ungava bays as well as the coast of Labrador. The inshore stream follows a longitudinal trough, which keeps it close to the shores of Labrador and the northeast, southeast, and southwest coasts of Newfoundland. Moderated by its southerly and westerly fl  ows, the inshore fl  ow of the Labrador Current nonetheless remains very cold, having a major impact on the climate of coastal Labrador and most of Newfoundland. Fresher Labrador coastal water from the inshore current fl  ows westerly along the Labrador side of the Strait of Belle Isle. 3 The  mixture  of  waters  from  the  Labrador  Current  and  the  Gulf Stream produces a rich blending of temperatures and salinity. The constant inputs of fresh water and solar warming in the surface waters of the inshore current result in shelf water. This shelf water mixes with the offshore current, modifi  ed by the warmer, deeper waters of the North Atlantic Current, called slope water. The counter-clockwise flow of the Labrador Sea, with its steep gradients, means that shelf and slope waters meet in a shelf-break front along the edges of the nearby banks. The mixing of the waters constantly brings to the surface  more nutrient-rich waters. These nutrients foster the bloom of phytoplankton, microscopic plants that are the most elemental part of the food chains of the animals of the North Atlantic. The much shallower waters of the Grand Banks further allow sunlight to reach the ocean fl  oor, permitting the photosynthesis required by phytoplankton to grow. At the same time, the cooler waters of the Labrador Current partially inhibit the growth of bacteria that would, in otherwise

## 6 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

warmer waters, kill much of the phytoplankton. Microscopic animals known as zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, serving in turn as the meals for larger fi  sh and crustaceans, which, in their turn, become the prey for each other, seabirds, and marine mammals. 4

The land masses of Labrador and Newfoundland are distinct from each other. Labrador is the most eastern extension of the Precambrian rock of the Canadian Shield. The Labrador portion of the Shield has four distinct geological provinces: Nain, Churchill, Grenfell, and Superior. The Churchill province has been historically signifi  cant for its huge reserves of iron ore. Newfoundland, on the other hand, is a geological orphan of the Appalachian mountain system to the southwest, although part of its westernmost zone, called the Humber, shares a geological ancestry with the Precambrian rock of Labrador. The Dunnage zone of central Newfoundland contains vast amounts of rock of  volcanic  origin,  consisting  of  copper,  gold,  lead,  silver,  and  zinc deposits that have served as the basis for mining on the island since the late nineteenth century. To the east are the gneisses and granite formations of the Gander zone. The easternmost Avalon zone has a separate geological origin from that of the other zones and consists of Precambrian volcanic and sedimentary rocks that have yielded, in various places, iron ore and other minerals for commercial extraction. Labrador and Newfoundland also have separate glacial histories. Although glacial periods have occurred as early as 800,000,000 years ago, the last glacial period began about 100,000 years ago and ended about 10,000 years ago. Subdivided into periods of differing ice sheets, those of  the  Late  Wisconsin period appear to be responsible for many of the province's river valleys and coastal fjords. Labrador lay under the Laurentide Ice Sheet, although the eastern Mealy Mountains and portions of the Torngat Mountains probably remained uncovered. Most of Newfoundland was covered by local glaciers. 5

While  the  combined  impact  of  ancient  geological  processes  and glaciations  produced,  in  many  areas,  a  coastline  of  daunting,  fortress-like cliffs that loomed over the sea, most of the land masses of Newfoundland and Labrador remained subject to the impact of the Labrador Current. The current's constant fl  ow of cold water, and the icebergs and pack ice it brings through Labrador waters into those of  Newfoundland  throughout  the  spring  and  early  summer,  produce very late, cool, and wet springs and cool summers throughout much of southern coastal Labrador and most of Newfoundland. The exceptions are those parts of the west coast from Bonne Bay south and the central lowlands of the Exploits and Humber River valleys,

areas which are beyond the infl  uence of the Labrador Current and which have longer, warmer summers (see map 2). Colder conditions and shorter summers characterize the subarctic climate of south and central Labrador and the arctic conditions of northern Labrador. Persistent high air pressure over the Labrador Sea in the spring makes easterly and northerly winds common. Newfoundland's climate is a maritime one, with plenty of precipitation in the form of rain, fog, or  snow.  Although the prevailing winds are westerly, tropical and continental cyclonic systems track over Newfoundland and southern Labrador, bringing highly unpredictable and stormy weather, with impressive volumes of precipitation. Along the south and east coasts of Newfoundland, inhabitants may expect a maximum of about 145 frost-free days each year, but the number of such days is much shorter to the north and in Labrador. 6

Newfoundland and Labrador's maritime, subarctic, and arctic climates, and its great amounts of precipitation, aggravate the poor quality of its soils. The retreat of the Wisconsinan glaciation about 10,000 years ago scraped bare much of the land and contributed to a very rough terrain. As the ice withdrew, it left rocks and gravel covering much of the high ground, while the highest elevations had nothing but naked bedrock. Low-lying lands, especially along river valleys, retained a stratifi  ed mix of sand, silt, and gravel. About one-third of the land surface of the island of Newfoundland has almost no soil. There are only extremely small pockets of organic soils throughout the island, and larger areas of mineral soils, including relatively fertile deposits of mixtures of alluvial soils, river sediments, and marine sediments. These sparse areas permit limited agriculture, but the generally shallow and acidic soils usually contain much gravel and little humus. They retain little water, and frequent, often heavy precipitation and spring run-off make them vulnerable to erosion and leaching, a process  whereby water drains nutrients from the soil. The vast bulk of Newfoundland's surface area may be said to have 'no capability for crops or permanent pasture use,' while much of the rest faces 'severe limits' that restrict what may be grown (see map 3). Nonetheless, the combination of relatively fertile glacial debris and warmer weather in the vicinity of the Humber and Grand Codroy rivers and their tributaries, on the west coast of Newfoundland, and in the watersheds of the Exploits, Gander, and Terra Nova rivers in central Newfoundland, give them a better agricultural capacity than most areas. 7

Climate and geology have also shaped the nature of Newfoundland and Labrador's forests. The western and central regions of New-

## 8 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

foundland contain the island's best tracts of forest. Much of Labrador to  the  northwest  of  Groswater  Bay  is  either  treeless  tundra,  where permafrost may be found, or tundra mixed with patches of stunted forests, as is the coastal area to the southeast and the Strait of Belle Isle (see map 4). Much of western Labrador is peat land, a mixture of lakes, rivers, bogs, swamps, and muskeg, broken by higher land of  either  barrens  or  forest.  Barrens  dominate the southeastern interior of Labrador, composed of rocky, windswept stretches of mosses, lichens, and areas of stunted black spruce or balsam fi  r. The shores of  Lake Melville and its tributaries, including the watershed of the Churchill River, are covered with boreal coniferous forest (the easternmost of which has been described as 'the fi  nest coniferous forest of the Province'), dominated by black spruce and much smaller mixed stands of balsam fi  r, white spruce, white birch, and balsam poplar. Similar boreal forests cover much of central and western Newfoundland, although there is mixed forest and tundra at the tip of the Northern Peninsula and smaller areas of peat land on the western side of that peninsula as well as at the bottom of the Burin and Avalon peninsulas. Although absent from the Labrador boreal forest, white pine was an important species in central and western Newfoundland. Its maximum size there of eighty feet in height and three feet in diameter made it much smaller than the white pine of Canada and the United States, and therefore less desirable commercially, but the local white pine nevertheless became an important commercial staple of the lumber trade, so much so that Newfoundlanders had commercially annihilated it by the early years of the twentieth century. Large tracts of the interior of the Northern Peninsula, the south coast of Newfoundland, and a corridor of land running from the south coast through the base of the Baie Verte Peninsula and then northeast along the coast of Notre Dame Bay are barren. 8

The  boreal  or  tundra-like  nature  of  Newfoundland  and  Labrador supports a limited fl  ora. Arctic grasses and sedges are common throughout  the  tundra-dominated  areas.  Peat  moss  dominates  the peat lands, while lichens are common throughout most areas. Feather mosses often cover the ground under the great tracts of conifers, as do a rich variety of mosses in wetter areas. Flowering plants include pondweeds, irises, and orchids, as well as the pitcher plant, an insecttrapping plant that is common in bogs and which is now the provincial fl  ower. Perhaps the most delightful plants to be found throughout Newfoundland and Labrador are the fl  owering ones with edible berries. Local people are especially fond of three varieties of the rose fam-

ily: bakeapples ( Rubus chamaemorus ), plumboys ( Rubus pubescens ), and raspberries ( Rubus idaeus ), among many others. Hardly less esteemed are members of the heather family, including the blueberry ( Vaccinium angustifolium ), marshberry ( V. oxycoccus ), cranberry ( V. macrocarpon ), and the highly prized ingredient of jams, jellies, pies, and other confections, the partridgeberry ( V. vitis-idaea ). While these berries are delicious additions to local diets, they have had limited commercial potential. Other plants include members of the honeysuckle family and a wide variety of woody shrubs, including the ubiquitous alders, which are common in forested regions and are important in enriching the soil with nitrogen. Finally, there are massive numbers of dicotyledonous herbs, mostly non-native plants that accompanied European migrants, including dandelion, thistles, and goldenrods. 9

The restrictions  of  soil,  climate,  and  fl  ora  that  characterize  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  might  best  be  appreciated  when  we  consider the narrow range of fauna they supported. Labrador has had a greater variety of mammalian species than Newfoundland, twentytwo in comparison with twelve on the island. Before the local aboriginal people's fi  rst contact with Europeans, a small number of species lived  in  the  interior  of  Newfoundland:  caribou,  American  beaver, and arctic hare. These animals served as prey for a large number of predators besides humans, including the now-extinct Newfoundland wolf, bears, and lynx, and a variety of small animals such as marten, mink, weasels, otter, and red fox. Bats and meadow voles are also part of the native fauna, while polar bears and arctic foxes are occasionally sighted. With the exception of polar bears, Labrador had no other large mammals than did the island but had a greater variety of smaller ones, such as porcupines, wolverines, lemmings, moles, fl  ying squirrels, foxes, and shrews. The last was introduced into the island of Newfoundland, as were snowshoe hares, red squirrels, eastern chipmunks, house mice, Norway rats, and mink. Moose were introduced to  Newfoundland in 1878 and from Newfoundland to Labrador in 1953. While Labrador shares the insect varieties of the other areas of the  Canadian  Shield,  the  island  of  Newfoundland  has  a  relatively small number of insects. Many of these are European migrants, but Newfoundland, like Labrador, has many black fl  ies and mosquitoes. Overall, the far greater number of predators relative to prey species in the prehistoric period has led one historian to call Newfoundland 'a rather impoverished piece of the boreal forest in the mouth of the St. Lawrence.' 10

The dominance of its marine environment meant that Newfound-

land's and coastal Labrador's marine and aquatic fauna were much more bountiful and, to a much greater extent than land-based ones, sustained the areas' human populations. Although large cold-water marine ecosystems with fewer species in  fairly  simple  food  chains dominate the western North Atlantic, its marine fauna were exceptionally abundant. The profusion of zooplankton supported capelin, a pelagic fi  sh of small size but great numbers and with a fl  esh rich in oil. Along with Atlantic herring, capelin became the main prey of the gadoids, or codlike fi  shes: Atlantic cod (including many sub-populations or sub-stocks, such as those that constitute the historically important northern cod groups), Greenland cod, haddock, pollock, and hake. In addition to the gadoids, capelin, and herring, the seas were home to many species, including smelt, fl  ounder, mackerel, redfi  sh, lobsters, and other shellfi  sh. Coastal areas supported mussels, softshelled clams, and other small marine animals. Anadromous species that migrate to rivers from the sea to breed, such as Atlantic salmon, arctic char, lake trout, mud trout, and lake whitefi  sh, returned to rivers from the waters off the Newfoundland and Labrador coastlines. Lake whitefi  sh were introduced into Newfoundland in the 1880s, as were later pink salmon, brown trout, and rainbow trout. There are also  a  variety  of  eels,  eel-shaped  fi  shes,  sharks,  and  rays  in  coastal waters. Many of the fi  sh were the prey of the seabirds such as ducks, geese, murres, gannets, puffi  ns, terns, gulls, loons, and the now-extinct fl  ightless great auk and the Eskimo curlew. 11

A variety of marine mammals lived off these aquatic species. Although a navigation hazard, the pack ice that dominates the Labrador shelf and the northern Grand Banks serves as the winter habitat for harp seals. For millennia, millions of harp seals migrated each year from their summer grounds in the Davis Strait along the Labrador coast. There the seals swam close enough to shore to be hunted from land with harpoons or nets. At the Strait of Belle Isle, the herd split in two as one group moved into the Gulf of St Lawrence and the far larger one moved down the northeastern coast of Newfoundland. In both areas the seals fed and mated in open water. In the spring, the females hauled up out of the water to bear and nurse their pups on the pack ice that had drifted south on the Labrador Current. Other seals swam regularly in coastal waters: harbour, ringed, bearded, grey, and hood as well as walrus. In addition to seals, a variety of whales and dolphins inhabit the waters off Newfoundland and Labrador, including pot head, minke, humpback, fi  n, and sei whales, and harbour porpoises, white-sided dolphins, and white-beaked dolphins. 12

Several views have been proposed about how best to support human  society  in  this  cold-ocean  environment.  Since  the  early  nineteenth century, this debate has been a defi  ning element in the history of Newfoundland and Labrador. 13  The following twelve chapters explore the history of this debate in light of the strategies various societies  developed to adapt and survive in such an environment. The book examines and interrogates the logic of a peripatetic Newfoundland nationalism that claims that the province can survive as a separate economic and political unit.

Chapter one considers the manner in which most prehistoric peoples depended on the exploitation of coastal marine resources. The nature of early European contact with the descendants of such peoples, the subject of chapter two, refl  ected the boreal, tundra, and coldocean coastal ecologies of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Norse abandoned the limited agricultural capacity of the area, while later Basque, French, and English adventurers found plenty of whales and fish to exploit, and the early Europeans were migratory hunters and fishers. Chapter three examines the manner in which the fi  shing industry and imperial rivalries fostered limited settlement, largely to the detriment of aboriginal peoples. Eventually, British hegemony in Newfoundland and Labrador resulted in the development of a naval government which failed to meet the more complex needs of a resident fi  shing industry and nascent colonial society. Chapter four therefore looks at the consequent transition from naval government to colonial government by 1824, showing how the societies and governments that existed in Newfoundland and Labrador before 1824 exhibited remarkable adaptations to the exigencies of life in a cold-ocean coastal environment.

Such adaptations were much less important in the struggle of colonial reformers for representative and responsible government, the subject of chapter fi  ve. Since they needed to obtain British imperial consent for constitutional change, but were faced with imperial indifference to the management needs of the Newfoundland fi  shery, Newfoundland governments turned to a ruinous program of landward economic diversifi  cation, which is examined in chapter six. Chapter seven considers the rise of colonial nationalism in Newfoundland by the early twentieth century. Local nationalist sentiments intensifi  ed with the participation of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians in the First World War, but war debt and postwar depression exacerbated the economic and social problems arising from the failures of Newfoundland's landward development, and merchants and politicians

frustrated the efforts of the Fishermen's Protective Union to secure better management of the fi  shing industry.

The subsequent social and political crisis led to the suspension of responsible  government  in  1934,  the  subject  of  chapter  eight.  The collapse of responsible government, however, did not lead to more interest in how communities might develop successfully in an environment dominated by the sea, and chapter nine explores how a British-appointed  Commission  of  Government  embraced  the  previous trajectory of economic development policy in Newfoundland. This occurred despite early misguided experiments which sought to achieve the moral reform of Newfoundlanders and contrary to an interesting proposal for the cooperative revitalization of Newfoundland and Labrador outports. The massive public spending triggered by the Second World War convinced many Newfoundlanders and Labradorians that they could have the same type of modern, urban, and consumerist society as had been developing elsewhere in North America. Chapter ten examines how such convictions fuelled Smallwood's successful campaign to bring Newfoundland and Labrador into Confederation in 1949, but how his subsequent development policies followed the earlier failures in landward development of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The modernization of Newfoundland and Labrador continued nonetheless, supported by federal spending in Newfoundland. Chapter eleven considers the new generation of neonationalists in Newfoundland and Labrador who were the products of such modernization. The book concludes with a consideration of the ecological and social problems posed by recent neo-nationalism within a long-term perspective on the history of Newfoundland and Labrador.

## The First Peoples by the Sea

The area from the northern coast of Labrador at Saglek Bay to the south coast of Newfoundland may seem cold, barren, and unforgiving, yet for almost seven millennia prehistoric peoples lived and travelled throughout the coastal regions of almost every part of what is now the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The fi  rst peoples of Labrador consisted of two broad groups, referred to in the scholarly literature as 'Indians' and 'Palaeo-Eskimos,' divided somewhat in ways that parallel the modern-day divisions between the Innu and Inuit. Both colonized the island of Newfoundland in successive waves of  immigration that spanned many thousands of years. Everything we know about these people comes from the work of modern-day archaeologists, who have uncovered evidence of pathways of cultural exchange, trade, and migration. Despite their many differences, one essential common trait defi  ned those who made Newfoundland and Labrador their home: they lived by their own cunning and wits in using the riches of the sea.

The Maritime Archaic people were descendants of the great migration of 'Palaeo-Indians' from Eurasia across the Bering Strait into the northern reaches of the American continent. Around 7000 BC, in the wake  of  the  receding  glaciers,  Palaeo-Indian  hunters  settled  along the  coast  of  southern  Labrador.  The  acidic  soils  of  the  region  have left little evidence of these people beyond some stone tools, particularly various forms of chert, a stone prized by prehistoric peoples for the ease with which it could be fashioned into tools. Archaeologists suggest that they moved into Labrador to harvest its rich marine re-

## 14 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

sources; they call the Palaeo-Indians 'Maritime Archaic' because of their heavy reliance upon the sea. By about 5500 BC the Maritime Archaic people in southern Labrador had tools that were distinct from those of their relatives in other parts of eastern North America. Some began to move northward along the Labrador coast around 4500 BC, and by 3000 BC others had crossed the Strait of Belle Isle to settle the island of Newfoundland. The expanse of time in which they lived and migrated across the coastal areas of Labrador and Newfoundland is astonishing when we consider that the entire history of settlement by people of European descent in the same region is only about fi  ve hundred years.

Archaeologists have found evidence of the Maritime Archaic people as far north as Saglek Bay on the coast of Labrador, through Sandy Cove and Rattler's Bight in Hamilton Inlet to L'Anse Amour in the Strait of Belle Isle to the Beaches in Bonavista Bay on the northeastern coast of Newfoundland. The richest discoveries have been made at Port au Choix on the west coast of Newfoundland, where an ancient burial site has told us most about these fi  rst people (see map 5). Located just south of the Strait of Belle Isle, the region was likely the area of longest Maritime Archaic occupation and lay along the major migration route from Labrador to Newfoundland. Two peninsulas, Point Riche and Port au Choix proper, jut out into the sea, where the cold Labrador Current meets the warmer Gulf waters. Although Port au Choix contains no easily worked stone, its ideal location for hunting made it an attractive place to live, and it became a hub in the exchange of cherts from Cow Bay in the south to Ramah Bay in the north. 1

It was the sea rather than the land that sustained the Maritime Archaic people. Caribou and a variety of smaller land mammals, in addition to berries and other plants, were important sources of food and material. However, Newfoundland and Labrador's boreal forests, bog lands, or subarctic terrains offered few sources of food as bountiful as those  of  the  sea.  The  Maritime  Archaic  people  hunted  a  variety  of seabirds and ducks, including the great auk and the Eskimo curlew, for meat and eggs. More important to the Maritime Archaic people were the harp seals that arrived in the region each spring; these early people also hunted other types of seals, whales, and walruses. They fished for cod, various fl  atfi  sh, salmon, trout, and shellfi  sh. 2

The Maritime Archaic people used slates and cherts to make spears and lances for hunting, developed barbed and toggling harpoons to take marine mammals, and appear to have made barbed bone tips with which to spear fi  sh. They do not seem to have had the bow and

arrow but may have hunted birds using small darts. Since migratory animals such as harp seals and caribou were available only on a seasonal basis, the Maritime Archaic people likely organized themselves into small kin groups, or bands, that could easily follow their prey. The elaborate burial ground at Port au Choix suggests that the Maritime Archaic people were not simply nomads. They likely saw the area surrounding their cemetery as the home from which they journeyed out to hunt and gather. During the fall and winter, the Maritime Archaic people may have followed caribou into interior upland areas, where they could also hunt bear, beaver, and arctic hare. The late winter and early spring would draw the Maritime Archaic out onto coastal headlands to take seals. The Maritime Archaic people may have used boats to hunt harp seals, but the drifting ice often came so close to shore that they could probably often hunt without such craft. The presence of so many toggling harpoons in Maritime Archaic sites suggests that they stayed on the coast throughout the spring and summer to hunt seabirds and other seals, and to fi  sh. 3

While we know something of their economy, it is more diffi  cult to put a human face on the Maritime Archaic people. Much of the culture and values of these fi  rst people will remain unknown, but there is some evidence upon which we might speculate. Artefacts and DNA analysis from archaeological research at Port au Choix suggest a clear division of labour between the men and women, although there is little evidence about who took responsibility for childrearing. The people of highest status would have been the men who had the greatest hunting skills and who travelled to hunt migrating birds, caribou, and beaver, which provided hides, furs, bone, and sinews that were crucial for utensils, clothing, and tools. Wives of these men likely accompanied them on the hunt to assist and process the game. The people of this group ate more meat and were buried with many more goods, further suggesting their higher status. The best hunters would have been accepted as leaders of the hunt and accorded respect through burial rituals. But the number of goods buried with them indicates that the Maritime Archaic people valued sharing their wealth, not accumulating it. Younger, more inexperienced males who were not yet skilled hunters probably made unattractive mates for women. These men would have depended upon the game they could more easily hunt while perfecting their skills. Finally, those too old to travel or hunt, as well as young children, stayed with women who had not taken a spouse or who had borne children and stayed behind to care for them. The predominance of saw-toothed points and harpoons suit-

able for spearing fi  sh in their graves suggests that these women fi  shed to provide for those who could not do so for themselves. Although the infi  rmities of age may have made elderly adults less important in providing their people with sustenance, the knowledge they had accumulated, and could pass on, likely meant that older people continued to be valued. The Maritime Archaic people may have viewed the elderly as shamanistic due to their knowledge of animal behaviour, the weather, and the environment in general. 4

The  manner  in  which  the  Maritime  Archaic  people  buried  their dead also provides clues to their spiritual life. The condition of many skeletons suggests that they had been buried after fl  esh had decomposed  from  them  and  others  had  been  buried  in  careful  bundles. Both suggest that although Maritime Archaic people died throughout the year, their remains were only temporarily interred until an appropriate time for ritual burial arrived. The presence in the graves of exactly the same types of tools and weapons as adults would have used in their day-to-day lives suggests belief in an afterlife in which people would continue on as they had in life. In particular, the Maritime Archaic people likely assumed that infants and children would grow into adults even after death. As these goods required a great deal of skill and effort to manufacture, the act of placing them in the graves likely indicates the respect and affection held by the living for their deceased. The presence of amulets fashioned from bone, antler, and stone into the shape of various animals further suggests that the Maritime Archaic people believed they could acquire traits, powers, or characteristics of the creatures being emulated. Similarly, the presence of large numbers of claws, teeth, and bones from a variety of animals suggests that the fi  rst people hoped to gain the abilities of these  animals  by  possessing  some  physical  part  of  them:  the  teeth of  a  fox,  for  example,  may  have  been  thought  to  pass  on  its  crafty hunting  skills.  The  presence  of  an  image  of  a  killer  whale  carved from stone in the grave of one young adult male has led some archaeologists to speculate that the Maritime Archaic may have held some animals in special regard, perhaps even to the point of forming a  cult  around  them.  Surely,  there  is  no  better  animal  for  sealers  to emulate and placate than a killer whale, for these toothed sea mammals not only are themselves remarkably successful seal killers but also are reputed to attack small boats. Hence, they would present a constant source of anxiety to people hunting from dugouts or skin boats. Additionally, based on the manner in which beaks, bones, and carvings of birds appeared in specifi  c graves, there may have been

some totemic  association  between  individuals  or  families  and  specifi  c species of birds. 5

It is too easy to forget, when describing the Maritime Archaic people's society at one point in their history, that they were innovative people  whose  culture  changed  over  their  three-thousand-year  history. The social and community organization of the Maritime Archaic peoples  was  not  static;  archaeological  evidence  of  their  dwellings suggests that the earliest people lived in single-family pit dwellings that  would  be  typical  of  small  hunting-and-gathering  bands.   The 6 later development of large multi-family longhouses suggests that the Maritime Archaic people came to congregate in larger communities for  a  variety  of  political,  economic,  social,  and  ceremonial  reasons. Stone projectile points found by archaeologists at L'Anse Amour suggest that the Maritime Archaic people constantly refi  ned their hunting technology. Furthermore, Maritime Archaic occupation patterns shifted over time. About 4000 BC, these people began to expand northward up the Labrador coast, possibly in response to a gradual warming trend that would have expanded the range of territory suitable to the pattern of Maritime Archaic hunting. Over the course of the next one thousand years, Maritime Archaic people reached as far as Saglek Bay, where they found Ramah chert, an almost translucent, beautiful grey silicate stone that fl  aked easily into sharp cutting edges. This northward movement may have brought the Maritime Archaic people into contact with the Palaeo-Eskimos, a people whose way of life refl  ected their arctic environment.

The early Palaeo-Eskimos arrived in northern Labrador from the western arctic sea about 2000 BC. As the climate cooled again, forcing the tree line southward, Palaeo-Eskimos moved from the high Arctic southward as far as Hamilton Inlet during a period of several hundred years. Their archaeological remains contain many small cutting blades and harpoon heads well suited to hunting marine animals. It is likely that the Palaeo-Eskimos spent their lives on the coastal edge of the pack ice, hunting the seals, walruses, small whales, and polar bears that frequented blow holes and polynnas, small open bodies of water in the spring ice. The Palaeo-Eskimos would retreat as the pack ice did, turning to hunting harbour seals, seabirds and other fowl, and perhaps even caribou that came out to the coast, as well as fi  shing for salmon and arctic char. These animals would have provided enough food to make trips to the interior unnecessary.

Although it appears that the Maritime Archaic people of Labrador retreated along the Labrador coast and into the interior around Lake

Melville as the Palaeo-Eskimo advanced, there is little evidence to suggest confl  ict between the two peoples. The Maritime Archaic people continued to travel to the coast to hunt, and the two peoples may have traded and interacted with each other. The Palaeo-Eskimos appear to have acquired toggling harpoons from the Maritime Archaic people, possibly in exchange for teaching them about the bow and arrow. Although differences persisted in the styles of tools and housing of the Maritime Archaic and Palaeo-Eskimo peoples, both balanced seal hunting with caribou hunting along the coast. 7 Yet both cultures retained their integrity and appear to have avoided much intermingling.

We do not yet know what became of the Palaeo-Eskimo and Maritime Archaic peoples. Their populations appear to have moved and fluctuated with changes in climate and through cultural interaction. Studies  of  similarities  in  blades,  tools,  and  other  artefacts  suggest that the Palaeo-Eskimo people may have developed into the Dorset peoples between 2000 BC and 1500 AD. Around 1000 BC, the Maritime Archaic people in Newfoundland disappeared, possibly because of changes in climate, a shift in the resource base upon which they depended, or the southward advance of the Dorset subgroup known as the Groswater, or Early Dorset people. In Labrador, the Maritime Archaic people appear to have relied more on hunting in the interior during a period of warming temperatures between 4500 and 2000 BC, and the later southward movement of the Dorset may have reinforced this trend. The archaeological evidence of the interior hunters has led them to be described as 'Intermediate Indians.' 8

From approximately 1000 BC to 800 AD, a number of distinct subgroups  of  Dorset  populations  waxed  and  waned  in  Labrador  and Newfoundland. In addition to the Groswater people, there were distinct Middle and Late Dorset cultures, although it is unclear whether groups developed one from the other or developed distinctly from common, possibly Palaeo-Eskimo ancestors. All of the Dorset developed tools that suggest the hunting of marine mammals remained the cornerstone of their lives. The remains of their early dwellings - small oval structures composed of bone, wood, and skins on top of irregular excavations - indicate that the Dorset initially investigated the hunting potential of an area through irregular seasonal visits. Once they learned  of  abundant,  predictable,  and  accessible  prey,  such  as  the harp seals of the Gulf area, the Dorset established more permanent communities based on the construction of larger, rectangular, semisubterranean houses. The Dorset people do not seem to have used boats in their hunting despite their reliance on marine animals. Partic-

ular subgroups, such as the Groswater people, may have disappeared because they did not adapt to adverse climatic change. However, as in the case of the later Middle Dorset people, cultures adapted by incorporating interior hunting, especially of caribou, into their seasonal round of activities. 9

By about 500 BC a Late Dorset culture developed in the northern coastal areas of Labrador. The Late Dorset people differed from earlier peoples in a number of ways. Unlike the other Palaeo-Eskimos, the Late Dorset people were hunters of the sina , or seaward edge of the  pack  ice.  Furthermore,  while  the  other  Palaeo-Eskimos  usually combined hunting land animals with those of the coastal waters and lived near inner bays of river mouth sites, the late Dorset preferred to live on outer coastal areas. From there, hunting parties travelled out to the edge of the pack ice. 10

Specialists  in  hunting  marine  animals  in  winter,  the  Late  Dorset moved south from northern Labrador to Newfoundland and inhabited many of the sites previously occupied by earlier Palaeo-Eskimo peoples. Those who migrated to Newfoundland concentrated on the west coast, in Notre Dame Bay, and in Bonavista Bay, where they had access to the richest food source available: the harp seals of the Gulf and front herds. Some settled on the south coast and Trinity Bay and probably depended much more on harbour seals. Both areas also had caribou herds that migrated close to the coast. Such herds would have allowed the Late Dorset people to maintain their characteristic maritime way of life. Unlike their predecessors, the Late Dorset preferred Ramah chert, although those who eventually settled in Newfoundland used a wide variety of cherts and nephrite in the construction of tools, implements,  and  ornaments.  The  beautiful  carvings  and  pendants made from ivory, bone, and antler found among their burial sites, although stylistically different from those of the Maritime Archaic people, suggest similar spiritual beliefs. The Dorset buried their dead in rock crevices with kits containing tools, weapons, amulets, and other objects. Around 800 AD, the Late Dorset population in Newfoundland disappeared. Although the reasons for this collapse are not clear, their dependence on maritime resources would have left them extremely vulnerable to fl  uctuations in the availability of seals. Adverse wind conditions, for example, if persistent for a few years, might have kept the pack ice offshore. This would have led to a subsistence crisis that could have, in turn, eventually led to the collapse of the Late Dorset population. 11

The  arrival  of  the  Thule,  the  ancestors  of  the  modern-day  Inuit,

spelled the end of the lineages of Dorset cultures. The Thule were seafarers who swept across the Arctic from the western Alaskan coastline by about 1000 AD. They fi  rst arrived in Labrador about 1200 or 1300 AD. Living in a treeless world, they invented houses, dog sleds, and skin-covered boats that were framed with whale bones and driftwood. Their single-person kayaks and larger umiaks gave the Thule a technological advantage in transportation in a coastal environment. Paddling these craft, the Thule harpooned small whales such as bowheads using toggling harpoons that would not come back out of the wound, attached to lines with fl  oats that tired out wounded animals enough for them to be approached and killed. The Thule did not hesitate to use whatever resources they found as they ventured south during the fi  fteenth century AD, eventually reaching the area around Nain. In doing so, the Thule had supplanted the Late Dorset people, whose material culture disappeared from the archaeological record. It remains unclear whether the Dorset were assimilated into Thule culture through intermarriage and the adoption of the superior Thule technologies or met more violent ends. The similarity of some of their harpoon technology, and Inuit stories about earlier people, suggests that there might have been a cultural exchange between the two groups.

Initially, the Thule established very small settlements, probably living in kin groups of between one and three families. In the summer, the Thule fi  shed and hunted caribou inland. They used the ground to shelter themselves, digging the foundations of their homes partially beneath the surface of the soil, then building a top structure using whatever materials might be at hand, from sod to whale bone. The Thule built these houses on outer islands to be close to ice-free polynnas, where the whales, walruses, and seals that were their favourite prey surfaced. Hunting and butchering whales and walruses required the Thule to congregate in large numbers. During the winter, some Thule might leave the main camp to move into the interior in search of game, building snow houses for shelter. Similarly, during the summer the Thule might move around bays and headlands, camping in tents of boulders and hides. Thule dominance of the coastline may also have led the Intermediate Indians who met them to depend even more on interior resources such as caribou, and some Intermediate Indians appear to have moved across the Strait of Belle Isle, possibly evolving into the Beothuks. 12

By about 200 AD an Amerindian cultural complex that likely continued the Intermediate Indian tradition occupied the coast from just below Nain southward into the Strait of Belle Isle. Although some

modifi  cations in the style of tools and other artefacts have been found, there are enough similarities to suggest a broad relationship between them, the earlier Intermediate people, and the subsequent Point Revenge Indian people of the fi  fteenth century. Like the other people of prehistoric Labrador and Newfoundland, their material of choice for tools was Ramah chert, a stone found only at Ramah Bay, which lay in Dorset territory. Although there was little overlap between the areas where Dorset and prehistoric Indian people established their camps, and both designed their tools very differently, some sort of exchange relationship facilitated the prehistoric Indians' access to Ramah chert. The evidence of one group at the Daniel Rattle archaeological site, for example, suggests they maintained hunting camps along the coast in outer headland areas to hunt seals in the spring and fall, to hunt walruses during the winter, and to fi  sh during the summer. They also used these camps as bases from which to trade with neighbouring Dorset people. Although they had access to a variety of cherts and other stones to make utensils, the people of the Daniel Rattle complex ritually burned Ramah chert, which suggests the stone may have had a spiritual signifi  cance for them. During the episodic disappearances of people, associated with the shift from Middle to Late Dorset people, the prehistoric Indians probably travelled to Ramah to procure its prized chert, but otherwise they appear to have gotten the stone from other people. The Point Revenge people appear to be the direct ancestors  of  the  current-day  Innu,  formerly  known  as  the  Naskapi and Montagnais people of Labrador. 13  The Thule people who later occupied Northern Labrador provided the Point Revenge people with another trading partner in chert but also provided competition for access to marine resources.

Archaeological evidence suggests that a 'Recent Indian' people (socalled  to  distinguish  them  from  the  Maritime  Archaic  people)  had become part of life on the island at about the time of Christ. There remains much to be learned about the relationship between the Point Revenge people of Labrador and Recent Indians of the island, but they may have had a common ancestor in the Intermediate Indians. Trade of materials, knowledge, and marriage partners from Labrador to the island would have been easy because the narrow Strait of Belle Isle serves as a highway as much as a barrier. The natural resource funnel of the Strait concentrated marine mammals such as seals and whales at specifi  c times of the year, making it an ideal hunting location. The archaeological evidence suggests that the Recent Indians moved back and forth across the Strait and that they had some sort of exchange

relationship  with  the  Dorset  people  as  well  as  Point  Revenge  people. Once on the island, the Recent Indians would have been able to follow the harp seals in a southeasterly direction along Newfoundland's northeast coast. The harp seals would have been particularly important prey as large numbers congregated close to shore on the arctic pack ice during the spring whelping season. Other Recent Indians moved to the island's south coast, where grey and harbour seals frequented its year-round, ice-free waters and near where the largest herds of caribou wintered. 14

Although  they  shared  much  of  their  culture,  there  was  variety among the Recent Indians. The 'Cow Head' tradition, for example, refers to the remains of people fi  rst identifi  ed at Cow Head on the west coast of the Great Northern Peninsula. There were also the 'Beaches' and the 'Little Passage' peoples. The earliest evidence suggests that these Recent Indians relied on hunting and gathering marine resources, although they likely hunted inland as well. Like the Point Revenge people,  those  of  the  Beaches  (800-1200  AD)  developed  an  economy based on the resources of the inner coastal areas. More important, the Beaches people used Ramah chert, which they would have had to get from Labrador through trade. The Little Passage people descended from the Beaches and were distinct in their greater use of bows and arrows rather than spear throwers and darts. It is possible that this technological  shift  made  the  Little  Passage  people  more  successful competitors for resources with the Dorset, perhaps even in warfare. Whatever the case, the rise of the Little Passage people has been associated with the disappearance of the Dorset in Newfoundland. 15

The earliest  sites  of  the  Little  Passage  people,  named  after  a  site between Hermitage Bay and Bay d'Espoir, are dated to some time between 1100 and 1200 AD. These people ranged around the entire coast of Newfoundland and are the direct ancestors of the Beothuks. The Little Passage people depended on a delicate balancing of marine and land resources. From spring through early fall, they would have been on the coast hunting and gathering marine resources. In the fall, they established camps inland, from which they would hunt caribou and trap smaller game and fur-bearing animals. The abundance of the caribou may have even drawn some of the Little Passage people into a more interior-dependent lifestyle than their contemporaries. 16

By the fi  fteenth century, the Little Passage people had evolved into what we know as the Beothuks. Although the Beothuks occupied a large area, the best guess of anthropologists is that there were as few as 500 people before European contact and no more than 1,600. While

in popular imagination they were mysterious people of the forest, the sea dominated the life of the Beothuks, as is evident in the importance of canoes in their lives. Their ocean-going canoes allowed them to visit outer islands to hunt seals and gather eggs and to pursue small whales, which they killed with toggled harpoons, a technology they probably learned from the Dorset people. Unlike most canoes, those of  the  Beothuks  had  straight,  deep  sides  narrowing  to  a  V-shaped keel, which, when ballasted with rocks, were very stable, and were not easily blown off course.

In the fall the Beothuks travelled further inland but do not appear to have strayed far from the coast. Initially moving inland to pick berries,  the  Beothuks  soon  turned  to  the  organization  of  their  caribou hunt. This hunt was important; they needed to kill large numbers of caribou so that they could store meat and fat for the coming winter. They relied upon caribou skins, sinews, and bone to make clothes, tools, and even their homes. The Beothuks constructed fences of broken trees, which often extended for many miles, to herd the migrating caribou to particular places at river crossings or ponds where hunters lay in wait. Some caribou might be killed as they passed through the fences, and the Beothuks often took to the water in canoes to chase and kill the slow-swimming animals.

Since  a  successful  caribou  hunt  required  many  hunters,  the  Beothuks divided tasks by gender. Many women were needed to butcher and process the animals into food, prepare skins, and make clothes. Men directed the hunt, but women and children may have helped pursue and kill the caribou. The large amount of work required for the hunt meant that the members of kin groups who otherwise spent the summer apart ranging along the coasts came together in the fall and winter. Away from the harsh winds of the exposed coastline, the interior must have been a more appealing place to spend the winter. Although the often deep snows of the interior could be daunting, the Beothuks' warm clothing and snowshoes allowed them to live and travel in comfort. They survived the dark and cold months by congregating in large groups and living off stores of food prepared in advance for the most brutal of seasons. To cope with the cold months, the Beothuks built more substantial houses, or mamateeks, that could accommodate about ten people. While the tops of the winter mamateeks were conical, the bottoms consisted of as many as eight walls made from tree trunks driven into the ground. The Beothuks banked earth against the outside of these walls to provide insulation and used layers of moss and bark to insulate their homes.

## 24 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

A band, or extended kin group, of between thirty-fi  ve and fi  fty-fi  ve people would winter together in a cluster of winter mamateeks. They held  special  ceremonies  of  feasting  and  dancing  each  year  as  they came together to cover themselves with red ochre; a coating would last usually for a year, and it was a source of shame to be asked by the band to remove it. Each person covered his or her body with ochre in particular ways to denote membership in the band. Winter was an important time in the formation of families, as young people would select their mates during the social times. Festivals and games also tightened the bonds within the band. Bands cooperated for specifi  c labour-intensive subsistence activities such as the construction of fences by which the Beothuks channelled caribou and the preparation of the animals for use once they were slaughtered. 17 The Beothuks were monogamous, and the relationship between men and women within the family was fairly equal. There is little evidence to suggest that male authority, or patriarchy, was very important.

The scale  of  the  caribou  hunt,  and  its  importance  to  the  subsistence of the Beothuks, likely encouraged the recognition of some leadership among an otherwise egalitarian people. Preparations for the hunt required skill and coordination. The long fences would have to be built and maintained, and the hunters' actions coordinated, during the slaughter. They might have chosen a 'chief' for his hunting skills, knowledge of religious ceremonies, and ability to lead in emergencies. Male hunters with unusual prowess, or perhaps those with wisdom and generosity, would be recognized by the group. Therefore, leadership was consensual. Such leaders would bear some evidence of their status, such as wearing slightly different clothes, by having a somewhat larger mamateek, or bearing some emblem of authority. Such authority would only last, however, as the band consented to be led by that person. The esteem in which the Beothuks held their leaders is suggested by the special burial treatment the latter received. When a leader died, the members of his band would inter him in a lavish burial hut. They would later lay to rest members of this person's immediate family when they died. The Beothuks buried others by wrapping the deceased in birchbark, then laying them out on top of the ground covered with stones.

Men and women shared in the spiritual leadership of the Beothuks as shamans or healers. Healers knew the medicinal lore of local plants. While shamans could also be healers, they were much more. The shamans served as intermediaries between the Beothuks and the spiritual life they felt animated the world around them. There is not much evi-

dence about the Beothuks' religious beliefs beyond their animism, a spiritual belief common to all of the First Nations of North America. The Beothuks further believed in a Great Spirit that had power over all  things. They feared a 'devil,' or malign spirit, that punished the wicked. The Beothuks appear to have treated death as a form of sleep. In  addition  to  ensuring  that  they  buried  the  deceased  with  grave goods that would assist them later, the Beothuks preferred to inter their dead close to the sea. 18

The Beothuks followed a seasonal round of resource exploitation dominated by life on the coastal fringe. In summer they frequented the sheltered inner shores and estuaries of the island's great bays as they fi  shed and hunted small game. They lived in small family groups and fanned out over wide areas to increase the likelihood of fi  nding enough resources to live on. Their housing refl  ected the seasonal pattern of their lives. The Beothuks' summer mamateeks could accommodate one to three families. These were covered with animal hides and bark, which could easily be put up and taken down and were well suited to travel along the coastline. The seashore was the place of  plenty  and  warmth  for  the  Beothuks.  Although  the  company  of friends and kin must have warmed them against icy winds and cold nights, the early spring was a welcome time. The Newfoundland interior supported very few fur-bearing animals, and there were no biggame animals to hunt besides the caribou. The spring brought sea ice and accompanying cold, wet weather with it, but the ice also brought an abundance of seals when the Beothuks' winter stores ran short. The Beothuks consequently welcomed the chance to move to outer coastal areas to hunt seals. It is likely that from such a coastal camp the Beothuks fi  rst saw the distant sails of European ships.

The sun rose and set over several distinct cultures over the seven millennia since people fi  rst set foot on the Labrador coast. From the receding of the last glacier to the arrival of European explorers, each of the fi  rst peoples by the sea had lived where they could combine the resources of the land with the abundance of food from the sea. Peoples with superior seafaring technologies such as the Inuit and the Beothuks inherited the edge of the continent and the island of Newfoundland, and thrived. They were our fi  rst peoples by the sea.

## The European Encounter

The cultures and material lives of the Innu, Inuit, and Beothuk differed from one another,  but  these  differences  paled  by  comparison  with those that existed between the First Nations and the European newcomers. The Norse explorers, who began to expand from Scandinavia from the eighth through eleventh centuries, were doughty seafarers. Familiar with the skills of latitude sailing, the Norse were expert in finding their way at sea by observing ocean currents, coastlines, and the migrations of fi  sh and birds. The material basis of their lives was not, however, the sea. For all the romance and legend of the Vikings, by the tenth century  AD, most Norse were Christian farmers rather than pagan warriors. Exploring for new land to farm, the Norse found little  prospect  in  what  is  now  Newfoundland and Labrador. While they came into confl  ict with the fi  rst peoples, the Norse had little impact on their way of life. Later European explorers and fi  shers came to catch fi  sh and hunt whales but otherwise saw little reason to settle the area. English attempts to establish proprietary colonies found that some local farming and forestry were indispensable to profi  table fisheries, but none of these landward activities supported settlements or colonies without the fi  sheries. Limited contact and seasonal trade meant that their early encounter with Europeans left the land beyond the western seas as the domain of the fi  rst peoples.

Norse expansion into the North Atlantic refl  ected the changing nature of medieval Scandinavian society and economy. The fundamental basis of Norse society was the landnam , or freehold farm or estate in a patriarchal social organization. Norse men expected to own farms or

practise crafts freely in animal husbandry and tillage that was suited to the use of pastures at high latitudes and in mountainous surroundings. Such expectations did not mean that Norse society was egalitarian. A hierarchical order of kings and nobles, sometimes referred to as magnates, provided freeholders with military protection and effective government in return for the control of larger estates and tribute. The magnates employed servants and slaves to work their estates and formed alliances with better-off neighbouring independent farmers. By the eighth century AD, population in Scandinavia developed beyond the capacity of local resources for freehold farming. A warming trend had made more land available for tillage, a process that benefi  ted the kings and nobility, pushing the greater population to look for new land to clear. As the population continued to grow, people found less pasture land, and interest in the colonization of new areas grew. Norse explorers, merchants, and plunderers developed vessels that were able to venture out into the deeper oceans from coastal waters and navigable rivers. These vessels increasingly carried members of the elite and their retinues, who were leaving behind more powerful rivals or the growing power of the Norwegian crown, or who were banished because of crimes against such competitors. 1

These Norse explorers established colonies in Iceland, supported by professional traders and ships' crews who participated for a share of any profi  ts. The Norse of Iceland later explored Greenland. One of the most important of these was Eirik raude Thorvaldson (Eric the Red). He fi  rst explored Greenland from 982 to 985 AD, and, with his son Leif (known as 'the Lucky'), established colonies there over the next  thirty  years.  They  found  some  pasturage  within  the  fjords  of Greenland as well as woodland that would provide construction materials and fuel. Its subarctic southern coasts could not support much livestock; Norse settlers had to hunt the same seals and caribou as did the Greenland Inuit. The hazards of navigation around the Greenland coasts  may have carried some Norse vessels to the coasts of Newfoundland. Such appears to be the case with Bjarni Herjolfsson, who in 986 AD brought back reports of new lands that encouraged the 1001 AD explorations of Leif the Lucky. Leif claimed Leifsbudir, a location close to the current-day L'Anse aux Meadows, as his landnam . The settlement he built at Leifsbudir served as the gateway to the southern land he encountered, Vinland, the 'Land of Wine,' a vaguely defi  ned area that might have encompassed the coastlines from the Gulf of St Lawrence to the Bay of Fundy. He fi  rst sighted Helluland, the 'Land of Flat Rocks,' which may have been Baffi  n Island. The next area was

Markland, or the 'Land of Woods,' a part of the Labrador coast. This area held much promise for the Norse, as there was always a demand for good timber. Vinland, with its varied woodland, game, and reputed wild grapes, was by far the most attractive area. 2

Over the next nine years, Leif and his family led expeditions to Vinland.  These  were  more  prospecting  voyages than attempts at colonization; there were likely no more than ninety people at any time living on the coast. The Norse explorers brought few of their female kin. The base camp they built at L'Anse aux Meadows contained halls, servants' huts, and forges, but no barns or other structures for sheltering livestock. Additionally, the Norse built their dwellings at L'Anse aux Meadows close together in a way that would make them easy to defend, rather than in the dispersed fashion of Norse farming communities. Finally, most of the artefacts left by the Norse at L'Anse aux Meadows suggest a people busy with boat repair rather than farming. The large halls likely housed the leader of the expedition, along with his retinue, while labourers and slaves would have lived in the smaller huts. 3

L'Anse  aux  Meadows  was  a  staging  area  from  which  the  Norse could explore the Labrador coast, the eastern and western shores of Newfoundland, and the north shore of Quebec. The Norse may well have met proto-Algonkian-speaking First Nations at Vinland and retreated back to the safety of L'Anse aux Meadows. The defensive nature of the L'Anse aux Meadows buildings suggests that the Norse used it as a retreat, possibly from clashes with First Nations. While it  may  have  appeared  to  be  a  safe  harbour,  L'Anse  aux  Meadows was a risky choice. Long before the arrival of the Norse, Ãpaves Bay had been a favourite place for fi  rst peoples to hunt and gather, and they may have been uneasy about Norse settlements. Meanwhile the Norse may have been nervous about encountering strange new people who were unlike the Inuit they had encountered in Greenland. Leif's brother Thorvald led an expedition to claim Krossanes as his landnam , not far from Leifsbudir. He spent two summers and a winter in Newfoundland and had fought with people whom the Norse called Skraelings. Iron swords were not particularly superior to the stone-tipped spears and bows and arrows of the 'Skraelings,' resulting in the death of Leif's brother during a skirmish in which eight of the nine of the Norse's foes were killed. 4

The Norse did not need Vinland, since Greenland still had plenty of land for settlement. It is possible that the Norse could cross the Davis Strait to cut timber without establishing any settlement. The trip was

only a short one from the northern hunting grounds of Greenland. Such hunts might have led the Norse across the Strait in search of furs. All  of  this  activity,  however,  depended  on  the  Greenland  colony's ability to sustain Norse exploration and resource exploitation further abroad. By the early fi  fteenth century, Norse Greenland was itself in grave trouble. A cooling trend appears to have undermined farming and trade with Europe. As the Norse colony at Greenland withered, the base necessary for further voyages to North America disappeared; although there is evidence that a ship from the Eastern Colony of the Norse in Greenland visited Markland in 1347. It would be about 150 years before Europeans would again visit Newfoundland and Labrador. 5

The knowledge gained by the Norse about the island of Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador had little lasting effect on their European neighbours' consciousness about what lay beyond the Atlantic's western horizon. In the fi  fteenth century, Bristol merchants certainly knew about Iceland's fi  shing grounds, and there were reports in England that an English Minorite, or Franciscan friar, had recounted travels in the North Atlantic, possibly as far as Markland, to the court of the English King Edward III in 1360. However, Iceland likely represented the outer limit of Europe's western world. In 1477, for example, Christopher Columbus may have travelled to Iceland on board a Bristol ship, but probably heard little from the island's inhabitants about Greenland let alone lands further west. The Norse explorations played no obvious part in Columbus's or John Cabot's later explorations and landfalls in the Americas. 6

From the  Norse  explorations  through  to  Cabot's  voyage  and  on to  the  fi  sheries  and  whaling  enterprises  of  the  sixteenth  century, Europeans often came to exploit the marine resources in waters off Newfoundland  and  Labrador's  coasts.  They  had  little  interest  in colonization, or in 'taking possession' of the region. The migratory fishery to Newfoundland, well under way by 1502, was one of the earliest continuous European activities in North America, although it was only conducted during the summer months. Everyone involved with the migratory fi  shery,  including  the  Spanish,  French,  English, and Portuguese, took a good look at Newfoundland and Labrador's coasts while fi  shing in the waters surrounding them. North America provided no treasure to be looted such as the Spanish had found in the Caribbean. Throughout North America, Europeans found, as had the Norse before, that the First Nations of the continent's eastern seaboard sometimes resisted intrusion on their lands but at other times

were keen to trade. Fur trading, like whaling and fi  shing, did not require settlement in the hostile new lands. 7

As long as the trade and resources of Europe provided enough opportunity, merchants had little reason to invest in expeditions to the New World. Merchants from Bristol, England, for example, probably invested in a few westward adventures shortly after 1480, but they had plenty of more secure investments in the trade of fi  sh, wool, cloth, and wine between England, Iceland, and the Iberian peninsula. Bristol-based vessels fi  shed in Icelandic waters, but as Iceland fell more into the orbit of the Hanseatic League, the main competitor of the English for trade in Europe, some Bristol merchants decided to search for fishing grounds to the west and likely funded the discovery of fi  shing grounds  surrounding  Newfoundland.  While  English  mariners  had fished in Icelandic waters, they lacked the navigational skills for great voyages of discovery to the west. Instead, Bristol backers turned to the Venetian citizen Zuan Caboto, called John Cabot by his investors. Cabot's own desire was to fi  nd a route to the riches of the Orient, or at least an equivalent of the gold Columbus found in South America. Cabot was one of a number of the fi  fteenth-century Mediterranean mariners who had become skilled in celestial navigation.  Bristol mer8 chants did not put much money into developing the Newfoundland fishery, though, and did not invest a lot in his voyage.

It  is  impossible to say whether Cabot even landed in Newfoundland and Labrador during the 1497 voyage. Cabot left Bristol on 20 May and appears to have made for Ireland, from which he could have sailed west along the line of latitude. The diffi  culties of taking navigational readings in the period, combined with the lack of certainty about exactly what part of the Irish coast Cabot sailed from, make it impossible to determine where he landed in June of 1497. The sparse descriptions of this landfall made by Cabot, and his son Sebastian, as well as the rumours that circulated in Europe about Cabot's adventure, variously support a landfall in Cape Breton, Newfoundland, or  southern Labrador. We must remember that geographical information about what was to Europeans a 'New World' was imperfect at best. While the most educated speculation places Cabot's landfall 'somewhere between Sandwich Bay, Labrador, and White Bay, Newfoundland,' no one can claim defi  nitely that Cabot raised the royal standard and took possession of Newfoundland or Labrador for the English  crown.  It  is  more  certain  that,  having  explored  the  waters around Newfoundland, Cabot left from Cape DÃ©grat in the Strait of Belle Isle to sail east and collect his Â£10 reward and yearly Â£20 pension from King Henry. 9

## The European Encounter 31

Despite better fi  nancial support for his 1498 voyage, Cabot and his crew disappeared at sea. Although the explorer had found rich fi  shing grounds, they were located in a daunting climate without much else that was immediately lucrative and in waters that fi  shers from Portugal may have already been using. Bristol merchants continued to prefer to trade local cloth for French and Iberian wines, turning their attention  to  the  western  Atlantic  only  as  wars  in  Europe  increased their dependence on Spanish and Portuguese markets. Cod itself did not interest the Bristolians since England had enough fi  sh for its own needs  in  closer  waters,  but  they  did  wish  to  increase  their  import trade and identifi  ed Portugal and Spain as the likely sources. While Bristol merchants and shippers traded for high-priced, low-volume items such as sugars, spices, fruits, and wines, they had only cheaper high-volume items such as cloth to exchange. Although Bristolians eventually expanded into the trade with the West Indies and the Atlantic Islands such as the Madeiras, for much of the fi  fteenth and sixteenth centuries, they did not give up on the dream of fi  nding a direct route to Asia's luxury goods. Bristol merchants backed John Cabot's son Sebastian, for example, in his expedition up the Labrador coast in 1508. Throughout the fi  rst half of the sixteenth century, the crowns of England and Spain sought Sebastian Cabot's skills as an explorer, navigator, and cartographer, meaning that his reputation and fame eclipsed that of his father. While precious metals, gems, spices, and cloths may have been on the minds of the Bristol merchants, the humble cod proved to be England's Atlantic treasure in the long term. 10

In the short term, Portugal claimed that England had no right to Newfoundland, which it claimed by right of the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1493. The Portuguese crown sponsored the exploratory voyages of the Corte-Real brothers, Gaspar and Miguel, in 1501 and 1502. To substantiate its claim, the crown gave Gaspar Corte-Real the captaincy over any territories  he  might  discover.  Gaspar  followed  in  Cabot's wake in more ways than one, also perishing at sea during his voyages. The Portuguese concentrated on their trade routes to India around the Cape of Good Hope, but JoÃ£o Alvares Fagundes, a wealthy, retired military offi  cer of Porto, had royal permission to explore and govern territories in Newfoundland and the offshore islands now known as St Pierre and Miquelon. Fagundes's claims led to no concerted efforts to colonize but provided a convenient way for the Portuguese crown to keep open the possibility of some day directing their imperial efforts  northward  into  the  Atlantic.  However,  the  lucrative  trade  in Asia and South America meant that while the Portuguese explored and sometimes fi  shed around Newfoundland, they were otherwise

## 32 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

insignifi  cant  in  European  expansion  there.  Cod  could  be  had  from other nations' fi  shers in exchange for wine, silver, or gold. There was no need to catch it directly. 11

The Portuguese involvement in what the English called the fi  sheries of the 'New found Isle landes' was small but still greater than that of the English in the fi  rst half of the sixteenth century. The Portuguese and English were adventurous dabblers by comparison with the French and Spanish. The Basques from the Bay of Biscay area in southern France and northern Spain, who might have sighted Newfoundland or Labrador before Cabot, had dominated the European cod fi  shery since medieval times because they had access to plentiful supplies of salt. With this salt, the Basques produced a better-quality preserved fi  sh that could be traded over long distances. The Basques continued  to  bring  cod  to  Europe  from  the  west  even  after  they stopped fi  shing in Icelandic waters, but before Cabot's voyage. The Basques came to these waters not only to fi  sh for cod, but also to hunt whales. By 1530, they were well established as the premier fi  shers and whale hunters of the south coast of Labrador, which they called la Provincia de Terranova , and the island of Newfoundland, which they called Ile de Baccaillau . Although a few vessels from each of the western European nations were visiting Newfoundland, the Basques were most numerous.

Along the Labrador coast, the Basques hunted bowhead and right whales for their baleen and blubber. Baleen could be used to make items that needed to be strong and fl  exible, and the oil rendered from whale fat was the petrochemical of the early modern era. Europeans burned it in lamps for light and used it as an industrial lubricant. The major whaling centres on the southern Labrador coast were at Red Bay and Chateau Bay. Usually twenty to thirty Basque ships travelled to these areas to hunt throughout the summer and might stay until January, and even later if the arctic sea ice blocked their ships. Each Basque ship sailed with a crew of 130 and would take back at the end of the season about two thousand barrels of whale oil per ship, each barrel weighing about 181 kilograms.

Whale hunting was a dangerous business. Much of what we know about the hunt comes from the remains of tragedy in the industry, both actual and anticipated: the wills left by whale hunters fearful that they might not return home and the archaeological investigations of the remains of those buried far from family, friends, and home on the Labrador coast. The Basques hunted whales by chasing them in small boats, harpooning the huge animals, and then attaching fl  oats to the

line, or allowing their boats to be dragged, until the exhausted whale could  be  killed.  The  whalers  could  be  capsized  and  drowned,  but many others died of lack of provisions and exposure when ice forced them to overwinter on the Labrador coast. While there is evidence of Inuit and Innu exchange of material goods with the Basques, and perhaps even employment of the latter by the Basques, there is not much evidence of good relationships with local fi  rst peoples, which might have helped the whalers endure the winter.

A number of factors diminished the Basque presence in Newfoundland  and  Labrador.  By  1600,  the  Basques  had  depleted  the  whales they hunted and shifted their effort to cod fi  shing on the south coast of Newfoundland. Spanish Basque merchants and shipowners found their fl  eet drafted and trade taxed to support the Spanish Armada, lost in the disastrous defeat by England in 1588. As a result, the Spanish Basque fi  shery was in ruins by the late sixteenth century, and French Basque merchants moved in to hire their crews, use their ports, and sell fi  sh and oil to them. French Basque gentry and merchants, such as Adam de Chibau, moved into their Spanish counterparts' trade, often with the fi  nancial backing of Spanish merchants. 12

The infl  uence of the Basques reached beyond their own fi  shing industry. Basque pilots were like the Cabots; they were available for hire and appear to have guided the ships of many nations to the waters off the eastern North American seaboard. Throughout the sixteenth century the fi  shery did not consolidate in any particular western European port. Over fi  fty ports continued to send ships across the Atlantic at the century's end, although certain ports had already begun to emerge as especially important. Norman fi  nanciers who backed French fi  shers,  for  example, got most of the supplies for their fi  shing voyages from the ports of Bordeaux and La Rochelle. By the 1550s, fi  shers from French Basque ports joined the Bretons and were supplied in a similar manner. From the 1540s, Spanish Basque fi  shers were going as well. While fi  shing fl  eets from Portugal and Spain tended to be small, the French fi  shing fl  eet grew rapidly to several hundred vessels by the late sixteenth century. 13

We must assume that many of these fi  shers went to waters close by Newfoundland and Labrador, but we cannot say for sure. Records of fi  shing enterprises of the period tend to be very general about the destinations of voyages. There are, nonetheless, records that suggest that the French were active in Newfoundland waters. In 1527 European visitors to St John's reported seeing many Breton, Norman, and Portuguese fi  shing vessels in the harbour. Jacques Cartier appears to

have depended on the familiarity of fi  shers from Brittany with the northeastern and northwestern coasts of the island in his own voyage of exploration. As in the case of other fi  shers, the French voyages to Newfoundland in the 1530s and 1540s were to establish inshore fi  sheries. These ships left Europe early in the spring and returned later in the fall. Fishing would be done near a shore and the salted cod dried on the beaches during the brief summer. Only after 1545 did fi  shing ships appear to be able to carry all of the materials required for the fishery of the great banks off Newfoundland. When such bank fi  shing developed, it did not require land or time for the construction of shore facilities at Newfoundland. Crews on the banks did not dry cod but pickled it in brine on board the ship and could thus catch full cargoes more quickly. These ships could, consequently, return to Europe much faster than those involved in the shore fi  shery. 14

Early  European  merchants,  shipowners,  and  fi  shers  organized their  production for international markets in broadly similar ways, although there was much local variation in what might be termed 'vernacular' practices. French, Iberian, and English fi  shing voyages all  tended to use ships in the range of 40 to 50 tons, although they might occasionally  use  ships  as  large  as  200  tons.  Shipowners  and merchants spread risk by investing individually in a great number of  ships,  a  way  of  not  having  too  many  eggs  in  one  basket  should one ship be lost at sea or have a bad voyage, as commonly occurred. The sixteenth-century fi  shery was not organized on a national basis. Merchants might provision their ships and engage crews from ports throughout northwestern Europe, making some cooperation between the fi  shing industries of individual countries a necessity. Merchants engaged crews by share agreements to begin work in April of each year.  Once  hired,  crews  pressured  their  masters  to  hurry  through the process of provisioning their ships and sailing to western Atlantic fi  shing grounds. Any delay ate into the short fi  shing season, from June through August, in the waters around Newfoundland, and made likely a smaller overall catch. Upon arrival, fi  shing crews had to build cookhouses and shelters, stages for unloading and preparing cod, as well as fl  akes on which the fi  sh could be dried. 15

Crews did not fi  sh from the large ships they sailed from Europe. They used small boats that they rowed or sailed from shore to the fishing grounds. Each small boat had a master, botswain, and an unskilled man. These men would use two or three handlines, each containing a couple of baited hooks. After a long day's work, the crew heaved their catch up onto the stage, where the shore crew took over.

Members of the crew, called headers and splitters, prepared the fi  sh for salting. Under the watchful eye of a beach-master, unskilled crew members would pile the split  fi  sh  with  salt  and,  after  a  few  days, spread it to dry on beaches or fl  akes. Crews always included a few young men who were apprenticed to learn the business of the cod fishery. Once the fi  shing was over in late August, crews often sailed their  ships  to  the  markets  for  cod,  exchanged  the  cod  for  a  paying cargo of foodstuffs and wine, and then sailed to another port where this  might  be  sold.  Back  home,  crew  members  received  their  pay according to skill, or at least a balancing of accounts as they might have taken an advance on their wages at the beginning of the voyage. Shares varied from the highest for beach-masters, ships' pilots, stewards, and surgeons through ships' carpenters, skilled fi  shers, and shore workers. The unskilled apprentices received the least, perhaps only a quarter of what the beach-master might earn. All received their pay by a share of the total share due to the ship's master. The precise nature of shares varied considerably by the region from which crews came. Crews from the Breton coast, for example, tended to accept less pay than their Norman counterparts because their masters provided them with wine or cider.

The provision of wine or cider might have lightened the hearts of crews who otherwise ate plainly. Without some light spirits, crews might have lived on little more than bread and water. Victuallers provided ships with biscuit, the staple of the crew's diet. In addition to their daily ration of biscuits, the crew ate smaller amounts of dried peas and beans, and some fat in the form of bacon or olive oil. These legumes might be cooked with a very small portion of salt meat or fi  sh, and would be seasoned with garlic, mustard, or vinegar. The terms of their employment allowed each crew member some storage for their own freight, a right called portage. Those who wanted a better diet might well have used such space to bring along more diverse extra food such as cheese. While crews could not work on empty stomachs, merchants had to supply the voyage with all the other equipment required by fi  shing: boats, hooks, lines, and salt. All together, the supplies the merchants provided on credit represented a signifi  cant risk. If the fi  shing voyage failed there would be no return on the investment, and voyages would not succeed if inadequately equipped. On a successful voyage, merchants expected to receive a 20-40 per cent return on their loans. 16

The increased European activity in the waters of the southern Labrador  coast  and  Newfoundland  attracted  the  attention  of  the  fi  rst

peoples of the region. At some point during the turn of the sixteenth century, the Inuit began to migrate south of Nain, establishing a community at what is now called Hopedale. Good hunting could be found in nearby waters, and the climate was slightly warmer than the northern parts of the Labrador coast. Other Inuit chose to settle at Eskimo Island, located between Hamilton Inlet and Groswater Bay, an area not frequented by whales and walrus, the basis of their economy and well within the territory of the Point Revenge people, who may not have welcomed such an incursion. The main advantage of Eskimo Island was that it served as a good base from which the Inuit could raid Basque whaling stations to the south. Basque whale hunting competed directly with the primary economic activity of the Inuit. There was little basis for trade between the Europeans and the Inuit, but the Europeans had boats that the Inuit could take, as well as spikes and nails that could only be secured by burning the whaling station structures. While Eskimo Island was close enough for the highly mobile Inuit to strike at the Basques, it was far enough away to make European reprisals unlikely.

Archaeological investigations suggest that the Inuit initially built homes much like those of their Thule predecessors but by the midseventeenth century had begun to use multi-family dwellings. The Inuit  homes  at  Eskimo  Island  contained  a  great  deal  of  European goods, including iron spikes they had fashioned into various hunting tools. They used European hardwoods in making fl  oats and ground red roofi  ng tiles the Basques had brought from Europe either for pigment or as whetstones for sharpening blades. Glass beads also seem to have been an object of Inuit desire, something that the Basques likely brought with them for trade. By the early seventeenth century, Inuit from other communities as far north as Killinek were acquiring smaller amounts of all these goods. The Inuit of Eskimo Island had become more than raiders by the end of the seventeenth century. They began to serve as 'middle man' traders between Inuit further north and the Innu of Labrador and European traders to the south. The size and complexity of the Inuit homes at Eskimo Island continued to grow, suggesting their success as traders. 17

The Inuit's southern expansion profoundly affected the Innu of the central and southern Labrador coasts. The Basque whalers, as well as French and Dutch traders, encountered Innu hunters on the coast, suggesting that the prehistoric Indians' use of coastal resources had survived into the initial period of contact with Europeans. Archaeological investigations of Basque whaling sites have revealed projectile

points associated with both Point Revenge and Little Passage people. These people may have come to Basque posts to trade food for European metals. Relations between the Innu and the Inuit may have worsened as a result of the presence of Europeans as trading partners. The Innu decision to turn away from the sea to rely on hunting caribou may have been related to violence at the hands of the Inuit, who wanted to monopolize access to Europeans, or to escape the growing hostility of Europeans to any people of the First Nations whom they may have blamed for the wintertime raids upon their property.

Dependence on the caribou hunt changed the Innu, who developed social strategies that allowed them to hunt caribou over the vast territory of the Labrador interior. To increase the chance of fi  nding caribou, the Innu ranged throughout the interior in small family bands led by male hunters. The dispersed nature of this hunting pattern allowed the Innu to take advantage of local supplies of edible plants, small game, and fi  sh that would not sustain a large community. By spreading  out,  the  Innu  did  not  break  down  into  small,  nomadic bands that had little to do with each other. On the contrary, the Innu remained in contact with each other as a nation. Each band looked for the great caribou herds, which, when found, would require the assistance of other families in killing and processing. Innu society might be thought of as a web spreading throughout the interior. People travelled from band to band, meeting at favoured locations at different times of the year to share information about hunting opportunities. In winter, the Innu family bands would choose a good location near a lake or river for fi  shing. During the spring, these bands would meet with others at places in the interior along which caribou were known to migrate to calving grounds in the high country. During the summer, the Innu would stay on barren land in the higher country. There the Innu would fi  nd porcupine, arctic hare, and fowl such as ducks, geese, and ptarmigan to hunt. When autumn approached the Innu would again rendezvous at points where they knew caribou herds would migrate back to wintering grounds.

In the fall, working in small groups of hunters and their families, but occasionally working in larger communities, the Innu would take 750 to 1000 caribou. While men killed the animals, women and children processed them into preserved meat, fat, and skins. As the success of the hunt became clear, a small group would leave to contact other hunting groups to advise them of their own good fortune. European observers often thought that the Innu were being wasteful in their apparent slaughter of the animals they encountered, but nothing

went to waste as people came from all over the interior to share in the hunt. In addition, preserved caribou was used in the caches that made interior travel possible and served as the main component of the Innu's winter diet. 18

The landward orientation of the Innu meant that chance contact with European fi  shers or explorers was unlikely. The situation was much different for the Inuit, and contact with Europeans foreshadowed greater diffi  culties to come. Some of the European goods found among the remains of the people of Eskimo Island may have come from contact between the Inuit of Baffi  n Island and the English explorer  Martin  Frobisher.  Although  the  English  lagged  behind  the French and the Basques in entering the Newfoundland fi  shery, they continued to have contact with the lands beyond the sea. Bristol merchants,  for  example,  continued  to  fund  searches  for  the  Northwest Passage.  They  assisted  Frobisher's  second  voyage  and  supported even  more  Humphrey  Gilbert's  voyage  in  1583. 19 From  the  1520s, the English continued to explore the western seas, and in the 1530s, English explorers had ventured to the Strait of Belle Isle to follow up on the work of Jacques Cartier. Frobisher had served with merchant ships in the trade routes to West Africa and, by the 1550s, had likely learned about the voyages of the Corte-Reals from Portuguese seafarers he had worked with. In three voyages undertaken in 1576, 1577, and 1578, Frobisher explored the northern Labrador coast, the bay that bears his name (which Frobisher thought to be a strait), and Baffin Island generally. Frobisher's tendency to kidnap Inuit for information and interpreters provoked hostile relationships with them, and later Dutch whalers' visits to the Davis Strait found the Inuit willing to trade but not otherwise welcoming of the Europeans. 20

Basque whaling stations, such as those at Red Bay and Chateau Bay in the Strait of Belle Isle, continued to be a longer-lasting source of European goods. The archaeological evidence for the early seventeenth century suggests that access to European goods had little impact on Inuit life. When the Inuit moved south, it was most likely to search for better hunting and greater supplies of local wood provided by the more hospitable climes of the central Labrador coast. It may also be the case that early contact with Europeans, such as the Frobisher and Dutch expeditions, introduced diseases among the Inuit that disrupted their community life and made access to European goods for trade more important. Gradually, contact with Europeans led to changes in the life of the southern Inuit. Well into the eighteenth century, these Inuit began to build larger, multi-family dwellings, integrated more

## The European Encounter 39

European metals into their tool production, and dealt determinedly with any new Europeans they encountered, such as the French from New France. Among the Inuit, good hunters and shamans had always had a special status. Some of these began to use their skills to acquire European goods for trade with other Inuit. Combined with the better resources of the southern coast, the Inuit there began to develop a society and economy based on trade as well as subsistence activities. From the north, Inuit traders acquired ivory, baleen, sealskins, oil, and feathers that they could supply to Europeans. The Inuit traders  then  sent  European  goods  north.  The  wealth  generated  by  this trade allowed the southern Inuit to establish larger settlements. As trade grew, and community size increased, the southern Inuit may have found that they could no longer maintain, or did not have to engage in, seasonal settlement on outer islands for hunting. Instead, the southern Inuit could rely on those to the north to do so. The more centralized and larger Inuit communities of the south often did not enjoy good relationships with each other. It may be that rivalry grew as each community tried to support its trade with the north. 21

To the south, the island of Newfoundland had been fi  guring more prominently in the European cod fi  sheries  of  the  western  Atlantic, particularly in the case of England. Merchants in Bristol found they could sell codfi  sh to southern Europe in exchange for the products they were importing, thus easing the ongoing trade defi  cit problem of the late sixteenth century. The riches Portugal and Spain had plundered in South America and the Caribbean excited envy among their European neighbours, England included. The English and French did not have the fi  nancial resources or political stability to build similar empires, but such problems did not stop some English adventurers from dreaming. While Frobisher had hoped to fi  nd a direct trade route to  Asia,  his  contemporary,  Sir  Humphrey  Gilbert,  thought  about  a different kind of approach. Gilbert, along with Frobisher and other adventurers such as Sir Francis Drake, spent some of their time in the 1560s  plundering  England's  enemies  as  privateers.  In  1566,  Gilbert proposed that England should build a colonial empire of silver and gold as had the Iberians. By 1578 he had convinced Queen Elizabeth to allow him to establish, or 'plant' as Gilbert might have termed it, a colony in North America. Although Gilbert planned to plant somewhere to the south on the North American mainland, the familiar sailing routes in the fi  shery led him to Newfoundland in 1583. There he landed at St John's and boldly claimed the island for England despite the presence of ships from other nations in the harbour.

Gilbert's trip brought him a watery grave and little else. His contemporaries probably did not think much of his colonial adventure, but the wars of the late sixteenth century began to convince many English of the need for a greater colonial presence in the western North Atlantic. In 1578, for example, Anthony Parkhurst proposed that the fi  rst country to establish settlement at Newfoundland would gain control over the entire fi  shery. If England did not become that country, then some other such as France would beat it to the prize.

The  English  government  did  not  have  the  fi  nancial  resources  to support  colonization.  Rather,  it  listened  to  the  wild  speculations of  colonial  promoters such as Parkhurst and fellow writer Edward Hayes (who had accompanied Gilbert on his earlier adventure), who dreamed of rich timber lands, shipbuilding yards, mines of precious metals and stones, fertile farms, and factories. Promoters argued that all these activities would supply the needs of colonial fi  shing people much more cheaply than they could be provided for from England. By lowering the costs of the fi  shery,  the  colonies  would  prove  immensely profi  table to anyone who would invest in them. 22

By the mid-1570s the effort of ports such as Bristol in the fi  shery increased dramatically, and it looked as if there would be much support among the city's entrepreneurs for some colonial adventure. War with Spain between 1587 and 1604, however, forced the English to turn away from any interest in colonization. The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 gave English merchants more confi  dence about fitting out ships for the cod fi  shery. A defeated Spain continued to try to exclude the cod of its enemy from its market, but through the 1590s Irish, Dutch, and French merchants were willing to buy Englishcaught fi  sh for shipment to the Spanish market, where the price was high. The requirement of fi  nancing of the fi  shing ships and the dealing with foreign shippers encouraged patterns of investment that, in the long run, proved better than the chartered companies in underwriting the fi  shing industry. West Country merchants knitted together an interest in the Newfoundland fi  shery that would last centuries and built on the longer trading relationships between ports such as Bristol and the Portuguese to ensure access to salt.

A good example of the West Country merchants is the Newman family of the Devonshire port of Dartmouth. The family had a long history in the cloth and woollen trades and at the beginning of the sixteenth century began to trade in wine. Soon they started trading their wine for fi  sh and salt for the local market. Once started, the Newmans' contact with the fi  sh trade began to grow. By 1589 John Newman was

## The European Encounter 41

trading fi  sh and sending vessels to Newfoundland to acquire more. The Newmans invested heavily in shipping, and the fi  sh trade gave them the opportunity to deploy their vessels in both the production and marketing of an important commodity. By the early seventeenth century, the family had assigned some ships to fi  shing, with catches being transferred to cargo ships that headed for Iberian and Mediterranean markets. 23

Peace in 1604 led to more English interest in colonies and the expansion  of  industrial  enterprises  abroad.  Through  the  end  of  the sixteenth century the number of ships sailing annually from Bristol increased, and by the 1620s between eight and sixteen vessels sailed for the fi  shery each year. The crown lacked the money or commitment to overseas enterprises and depended upon subjects to undertake the expenses of harassing the shipping of enemies (through privateers) and founding colonies. The king was willing to grant lands in the new world to private investors if they enforced English law and increased the trade of the kingdom. The renewed interest in an English fi  shery in Newfoundland did not mean that anyone rushed to undertake the expenses of forming a colony. Bristol investors were uninterested, but some wondered if a colony might supply the fi  shery itself without the cost of shipping in provisions. In 1610, for example, Bristol and London merchants founded the London and Bristol Newfoundland Company in an effort to lower some of the costs associated with the migratory fi  shery. King James I granted the company a royal charter for the entire island of Newfoundland. The investors hoped that their colony in Conception Bay, named Cuper's Cove (later Cupids), under the direction of John Guy, would make money. Colonists could fi  sh earlier and later in the year than migratory fi  shermen and would not have to rebuild wharves and stages each spring. Colonists could also lay claim to the best fi  shing grounds and beaches for drying fi  sh before the arrival of competing fi  shers in the early summer. 24

Guy's colony at Cuper's Cove represented a fi  rst attempt at organized European settlement in Newfoundland, an attempt that likely did not profi  t the investors. The colony was more successful, however, in establishing the notion among some English adventurers that the island, or at least the Avalon Peninsula, was a 'new land' devoid of Christian inhabitants and thereby open to be claimed by the English as their own. Earlier proponents of settlement and people active in the migratory fi  shery, such as Anthony Parkhurst (who visited Newfoundland a number of times between 1575 and 1578) and Captain Richard Whitbourne (who visited Trinity Bay in 1579), gave no indica-

tion that they noticed the Beothuks at all or else felt that the Beothuks did not frequent the Avalon Peninsula. This was important, since the 1606 colony at Jamestown, Virginia, had met a hostile reception from local Amerindians. Since no 'Christian king' had sovereignty over the new land, the Europeans felt free to move in and establish their own laws. And since the indigenous peoples Europeans encountered had not 'improved' land by cutting its forests and fencing and planting fields, they had not made the land into private property. In their own minds, Europeans thought the land was free for them to take. First Nations who lived on the land might be suitable trade partners or maybe even souls to save though conversion to Christianity, but they were not subjects of a Christian king and therefore had no real rights. In other words, the supposed moral superiority of Christianity was seen by the English and other Europeans as giving them the right to subordinate fi  rst peoples in their own lands, especially if such subordination included the establishment of lucrative fur trades or other commercial activities.

Originally, John Guy's instructions had been to establish peaceful relations with the Beothuks; he had met with a few and exchanged a few European items for some furs. Rumours of Beothuks living in nearby Trinity Bay had reached Guy's colony by 1612, when he sent explorers across the arm of land separating Conception and Trinity bays. Although these explorers met no Beothuks, they discovered evidence of the extensive use the Beothuks made of the area extending from present-day Dildo Arm to Bull Arm. This discovery prompted Guy into mounting a larger expedition; in October he sent a barque and shallop with crews and trade goods into Trinity Bay. The crews of these vessels were to explore the resources of the south side of the bay and to contact the Beothuks. The explorers found Beothuk camps at what are now Hopeall and Dildo South and, when they ventured into the interior, found a canoe, evidence of a fi  re, and smoke on the shore of Dildo Pond. Guy's men left some trinkets and biscuit in exchange for taking some beaver meat and children's moccasins. Guy's party then ventured to the bottom of Trinity Bay, where, in the vicinity of what is now known as Bull Arm, they discovered a Beothuk path that crossed the narrow Isthmus of Avalon to Placentia Bay. Again discovering ample sign of the Beothuks' presence, the English sailed further, with Guy hoisting a white fl  ag in the hope of establishing that he meant only trade, not harm. This tactic met with some success, as a group of Beothuks used a signal fi  re to draw the ships' attention. Eight Beothuk men met with Guy and his captains. They exchanged

mutual signs of friendship, gave each other gifts, and shared a meal. Guy's party stayed in the area for a while to explore. While Guy established no commitment to trade with the Beothuks his group had met, the Bristol colonizer had reason to hope. On the explorers' return to Cupids, they passed the site of their original meeting with the Beothuks and found some furs and other goods hung, apparently left as gifts. Guy had not brought along much to trade, so he left a pair of scissors, some needles, a knife, and a hatchet in place of some of the skins. 25

The Beothuks had little interest in trade and avoided the unpredictable and potentially dangerous fi  shers, although there is evidence that sixteenth-century European visitors had brought iron goods specifi  cally for trade with them. 26 They did not need European allies in their own confl  icts with other peoples as was often the case in North America. More important, European fi  shers left behind iron nails and many other items when they left each fall; the Beothuks could scavenge abandoned fi  shing premises for the metal goods that made their lives easier. Most hunter-gatherers did not have the same notion of private property as did the property-obsessed Europeans and would have viewed anything left behind when a people moved on as free for others to take and use.

By contrast, the Innu and Inuit of Labrador established fur trades with  French,  English,  and  Basque  fi  shers,  whalers,  and  explorers. The Innu, who visited the Great Northern Peninsula, may even have traded European manufactures for furs from the Beothuks, becoming 'middle men' in the trade. The opportunities for desirable European goods such as portable and durable copper kettles and iron knives, hatchets, and spear points may have prompted the Innu to shift their economy from a heavy reliance on marine resources to a more interior adaptation. Harvesting greater numbers of fur-bearing animals and spending less time on the coast likely prompted some cultural changes, but the low frequency of meeting with Europeans allowed the  Innu  to  maintain  many  qualities  of  their  society.  Although  the Inuit's relations with European fi  shers and whalers had been more strained, the Labrador coast's more daunting ecology was inimical to sustained, direct contact between the two peoples.

Little came from John Guy's hope for trade with the Beothuks, and the colony failed to live up to the expectations of its backers. Growing competition from London merchants, and the feeling that the investors at home had not supported the enterprise with suffi  cient funds, caused John Guy to withdraw from the adventure. Others, such as

## 44 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

John Mason and Henry Crout, continued to explore the island and attempt contact with the Beothuks, but little came of it. The French in Canada brought missionaries along to convert the First Nations, and these missionaries acted as intermediaries between the two peoples. The fl  edgling colonies in Newfoundland could not afford to support missions, and the English were more interested in making a profi  t from the fi  sh trade than they were in the fate of the Beothuks' souls. More important, the far greater numbers of seasonal migratory fi  shermen who arrived from Europe each year overshadowed the settlers' efforts. For example, Guy had sent only two craft into Trinity Bay in 1610, but more than sixty ships in the migratory fi  shery carried English fi  shers into Trinity Bay in 1620. These migratory fi  shermen cared little for trade with the Beothuks and knew less about the fi  rst peoples than the settlers did. While the settlers were careful about the manner in which they tried to contact the Beothuks, the seasonal fi  shermen blundered ashore in great numbers looking after their own wants and worrying little about giving offence to anyone else. Fear and suspicion matched these fi  shermen's ignorance; they had a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later when approached by the Beothuks. 27

Despite their efforts to establish good relations with the Beothuks, the French who became involved in a migratory fi  shery to Newfoundland developed a relationship as poor as the English one. Initially interested in fi  sheries as an outgrowth of their European trades, and in exploratory adventures in search of oriental riches, the occasional and seasonal visits by Europeans to the shores of Labrador and Newfoundland provided little reason for the development of good relationships with the fi  rst peoples. As in the case of Frobisher's relationship with the Inuit, intermittent contact with the fi  rst peoples could lead to hostility and confl  ict. The Basques may have inadvertently affected the trade  and  relations  of  the  Labrador  peoples.  Overall,  however,  the impact of Europeans on the fi  rst peoples was minimal as even the first attempts at proprietary colonies proved disappointing. Growing European interest in settlement and colonization would change this, leading to confl  ict reminiscent of the Norse experience centuries before, but with more disastrous implications for the Amerindians of Newfoundland and Labrador.

## Migrants and Settlers: The Development of a Fishing Society, 1610-1775

The Cupids colony failed as a profi  table colonial adventure on the part of its Bristol investors, but it was the fi  rst blow against the dominion of Newfoundland by the fi  rst peoples. The Cupids colonists built a well-fortifi  ed and comfortable compound, sowed their crops, sawed lumber for boats and buildings, and began to fi  sh in their fi  rst year. Over the long term, the colonists hoped they could locally supply the fishery more cheaply than migratory fi  shers and enjoy a longer fi  shing season by being freed from travelling to and from Europe each year. While profi  ts from such a colonial strategy proved elusive, the Cupids settlers laid the basis for permanent European settlement in Newfoundland. Early colonization failed, but English interests came to  accept settlement as necessary for the defence of their fi  sh trade from European rivals and encroachments by locally competing aboriginal interests.

Europeans mistook the coastal lands used by the Beothuks as empty,  and  migratory  fi  shers  felt  free  to  leave  fi  shing  premises  unprotected at the end of the fi  shing season. From the Beothuk perspective, they could gather from abandoned fi  shing premises each winter the metal goods that made their lives easier. The Beothuks did not see the premises as private property but rather as something abandoned and therefore free to take without the risk of contact with potentially violent Europeans, although their scavenging eventually earned them a reputation as thieves. Thus, in the fi  rst century or so of sharing the island with European visitors, the Beothuks prospered from the iron tools that made their lives easier without altering their culture and communities. 1

No lucrative fur trade with the Beothuks awaited the Cupids colony, which also found that its agricultural and other landward economic activities  provided few opportunities for profi  t. The colonists' fi  shery faced persistent depredations by pirates such as Peter Easton. The Bristol and London Company began to sell rights to colonize parts of Newfoundland to investors such as the Welshman William Vaughan in 1617. Vaughan established a colony between Caplin Bay and Placentia Bay on the Avalon Peninsula. The colony's settlers benefi  ted from the leadership of Captain Richard Whitbourne, but, despite a move to Renews in 1618, the colonial adventure was over by 1619. Vaughan and Whitbourne wrote books The Golden Fleece and Discourse and Discovery respectively - promoting colonization, but both acknowledged that future colonization would have to depend on the fishery. Former partners of the Bristol and London Company established a more successful colony at Bristol's Hope (Harbour Grace), Conception Bay, in 1618, which lasted until 1631. Those who fi  shed there likely prospered, but without much help from their governor. In 1623 Henry Cary, Viscount Falkland, established another colony between Ferryland and Aquafort on the north, and Renews in the south, but little is known of the colony as it too ceased to exist by 1628. While all of these colonies disappointed their backers, they brought out settlers who stayed and formed the basis of a permanent population of European descent in Newfoundland. 2

These settlers learned that their well-being depended on the fi  shery just as the merchants who backed the migratory trade came to understand that they depended on settlers. West Country merchants were coming to dominate the English fi  shery; from 1610 the migratory trade from the ports of Plymouth, Dartmouth, and Bideford in Devonshire, as well as from Dorset and Hampshire, had thrived. The merchants of these ports used a share system to fi  nance their industry, but it was expensive and risky to fi  t out vessels and crews for the annual trips to Newfoundland. Some settlers annoyed the West Country merchants by trying to exploit exclusively good shore facilities previously used by the migratory fi  shermen. Overall, the settlers were too few in number to be more than a nuisance, and many West Country merchants found that they could make money by supplying the settlers alongside the migratory trade. Settlers and migratory fi  shers probably saw little difference between themselves. There were few female settlers, meaning that most single males had little opportunity to establish their own households or accumulate much property on their own. The population of those who saw Newfoundland as their home

consequently grew slowly. While many of the single men among the settlers may have hoped to return to England, or perhaps move on to  another colony, in the meantime they hired migratory labourers to help in their fi  sheries and made money by cutting wood for the migratory operations. Some settlers might sell liquor and tobacco to the migratory fi  shermen from their homes. Providing a little comfort to migratory fi  shermen could be a lucrative supplement to the unpredictable fi  shery. 3

Although migratory shipowners found that the handful of settlers in Conception Bay posed little threat to their voyage, the same could not be said for the colony of Avalon, established by George Calvert, who acquired William Vaughan's rights to the area. An investor in the Virginia and the East India Companies, Calvert was determined to succeed in Newfoundland. He sent artisans and builders to Ferryland, under the command of Edward Wynne, to construct a fortification, stone quay, forge, kitchen, mansion, and houses, all along a cobblestone street. By 1625, one hundred settlers were farming and fishing there, and Wynne brought out additional artisans, as well as women to bake bread and brew beer for them. Calvert was well connected in England, becoming Lord Baltimore for his role in English politics but, as a Roman Catholic, decided to make Avalon into a bulwark against Protestantism in the new world. He brought his family to  Ferryland, with more Catholic settlers and a priest in 1628, and, although he tried to ensure that the colony would be guided by religious toleration, his 'Romish' sympathies antagonized the bulk of his Protestant colonists. 4

Plagued  by  sectarian  tensions,  Baltimore's  colony  successfully fought  off  raids  by  French  pirates  under  the  command  of  Captain Raymond de la Ralde, but the colonists found it diffi  cult to raise much besides root crops to supplement insuffi  cient imported supplies, particularly  during the cooling global climate of the early seventeenth century. In 1629, Baltimore moved to Maryland because of political harassment in London and the troubles of the colony, but he did not abandon the colony of Avalon, realizing that his settlers were engaged in a lucrative fi  shery. He left as his agent in charge of the plantation, a former soldier, emphasizing just how much attention had to be devoted to defence rather than productive enterprise. 5

Offi  cial colonization had failed, but a settler population had been established  that  needed  a  mechanism  to  resolve  disputes  with  migratory fi  shing interests. 'Fishing admirals' had customary legal authority for the migratory fi  shery since at least the beginning of the

seventeenth century. The fi  rst fi  shing captain to arrive in each Newfoundland harbour for the fi  shing season would become admiral, the second vice admiral, and the third the rear admiral. Without court offi  cers or chambers, the fi  shing admirals were to keep law and order in the fi  shery. A 1634 code issued by London's Court of Star Chamber, the Western Charter, formalized the fi  shing admirals' legal authority over the administration of the fi  shery, giving them legal jurisdiction over all but capital crimes and theft of more than 40 shillings. Capital crimes were to be tried in England - an unworkable system which required the accused and witnesses to be transported across the sea before justice could be done. Through to 1670, the English government sought to buttress the migratory fi  shery by making fi  shing admirals enforce laws against the transportation of passengers to Newfoundland or the assignment of legal rights to overwintering shore crews since some migratory shipowners feared that if too many people became residents on the island, then all the best space on shore would be lost to them. The fi  shing admirals did little to discourage settlement and probably followed English common law in their judgments, usually  confi  ning  themselves  to  settling  disputes  over  the  right  to  use particular fi  shing rooms. 6

In practice, fi  shing admirals refl  ected the ambivalence of English state policy toward the growing interdependence of residents and migratory fi  shing interests. It was diffi  cult to distinguish between the two since settlers were often transient, moving from fi  shing station to fi  shing station looking for work or better facilities for fi  shing. To anyone living and working there, Newfoundland was simply part of a 'Greater New England,' an integral part of the trade of the Atlantic world in which the people of the British Isles were accustomed to moving about. 'By-boat keepers,' migratory boat owners who came out yearly to fi  sh,  but  who left their water craft in Newfoundland, were becoming more important in the fi  shery and were becoming difficult to distinguish from residents by their conduct of business and tendency to settle. Proponents of settlement pointed out that settlers helped to keep Newfoundland out of the hands of the French and were a profi  table source of trade for many merchants and shipowners. The Western Charter consequently recognized settlement, but protected migratory fi  shers' use of land, timber, and shore facilities, and continued to allow the mayors of the West Country towns to oversee the administration of justice at Newfoundland.

West Country shipowners and merchants had built the trade without state protection, monopolies, or subsidy, as had been the case in

other areas of imperial expansion, and did not want the government to interfere in their trade. They were content that the charter of 1634 recognized their right to fi  sh and trade at Newfoundland. Most West Country merchants had begun to specialize in trade, carrying by-boat keepers and passengers to Newfoundland, supplying them and resident fi  shers  in  return  for  their  catches.  Merchants  crammed  many people and a lot of goods into their ships. Most ships were from 40 to 100 tons in size, but they could occasionally be as small as 15 or as large as 200 tons. Provisions were stored below, and the passengers and crew were quartered on the deck, although there was usually only enough space for half of the people to sleep at once. Despite the harsh nature of conditions, there was no shortage of people willing to go fi  shing. Every winter, merchants and shipowners would spread the word that they needed crews for the summer. In February, the rural people of the West Country would attend fairs in market towns such as Poole or Newton Abbott looking for work. Agents of the fi  sh merchants or their ships' captains would pay potential members of a fishing crew a small sum in advance to seal a contract. New fi  shing servants  would  then  make  their  way  to  port  and  help  prepare  the voyage. Sometime before February, West Country ships would sail for the coast of Ireland, as had the Cabots so many years before. Here they could run before prevailing easterly winds that carried them to the Grand Banks. Once fi  nished at Newfoundland, many ships sailed for Mediterranean or West Indies markets fi  rst, while others left behind crew members to make room for fi  sh. In such cases, it might be a long time before crews saw their home ports again. 7

Tensions between migratory shipowners and those who supported settlement and the by-boat fi  shery continued, but the English Civil War of 1642-8, the Restoration of the English crown in the 1650s, and war with Spain from 1655 to 1660, all disrupted the migratory trade but made the administration of Newfoundland a low priority in London. During the seventeenth century, the English did not dominate the naval and mercantile affairs of the North Atlantic. By the 1630s, Dutch traders were using more cost-effective cargo ships and better access to Spanish ports to make serious inroads on the carrying trade in  English-caught  fi  sh.  Many  English  merchants  and  shipowners participated in the fi  shery by fi  nancing sack ships. These were cargo vessels that carried provisions, equipment, and labour to the Newfoundland fi  shery in return for fi  sh products to be sold in southern European markets; their owners and backers made money solely in freight  rather  than  the  production  of  fi  sh.  Preoccupied  by  war,  the

English government had little energy to spare for protecting the sack trade and the cod fi  shery and relied on some settlement at Newfoundland to protect its claim to the island. The threat of Dutch mercantile hegemony in Europe, by 1656, prompted fi  erce maritime rivalry with England. Many of the English policies, such as the Acts of Trade and Navigation of the 1660s which required English merchants to use English-registered vessels, were acts of economic warfare against the Dutch. Twice the Dutch raided Newfoundland, fi  rst hitting St John's, Bay Bulls, and Ferryland, then, in 1673, Ferryland alone. The Dutch were not prepared to establish settlements that could compete with the English and French at Newfoundland and abandoned their interest in it. The French responded to the Dutch threat and the English presence in Newfoundland by building the settlement and military fortifi  cation of Plaisance in 1662, using it as a base to guard approaches to the Gulf of St Lawrence and New France as well. 8

By comparison with the French, English settlement grew informally. Some West Country merchants left behind servants to maintain possession of shore facilities against competitors who might arrive fi  rst the next spring. These wintering servants could protect premises from pillaging and could begin fi  shing earlier in the spring. Merchants in the migratory trade found their overhead costs could be lowered by supplying residents or by-boat keepers. Many by-boat keepers also stayed year-round to guard their premises and take advantage of a longer fi  shing season. A few by-boat keepers and servants settled permanently, marrying into resident families established in the earlier colonial ventures of the seventeenth century. The permanent settlers who owned boats, gear, and shore premises became known as planters. They supplemented the potentially profi  table but risky business of  fi  shing  with  a  little  subsistence  farming,  cutting  wood,  building boats, trapping furs, and providing services and supplies to migratory fi  shers.

The  balance  between  residents  and  migratory  fi  shing  interests could be upset. By 1638, for example, the English merchant and adventurer David Kirke had acquired rights to Baltimore's interests at Ferryland. Kirke established his own family there and began to trade with Baltimore's old settlers. Entrenching himself as the patron of local  settlers,  Kirke  used  his  colonial  charter  to  act  as  governor,  taking the best fi  shing  facilities  for  his  colonists  and  taxing  migratory fishers working within the boundaries of his colony by taking a portion of their catch. By 1652, Kirke, a royalist, was out of favour with the new Commonwealth government in London. It acted upon West

Country merchants' complaints about Kirke by sending a governor, John Treworgie, who quieted relations between settlers and the migratory shipowners. Kirke likely died in prison in 1654 awaiting trial for charges of interfering in the migratory fi  shery, but his wife, Lady Sarah Kirke, continued to manage the family's business at Ferryland through  1679,  eventually  building  the  largest  and  most  successful plantation  in  Newfoundland.  Three  of  the  Kirke  sons  also  became successful planters, continuing in the fi  shery until they were driven out by the French army in 1697. Charles II had recognized that amicable relations between settlers and migrants would be maintained if colonial authorities protected the latter. The Crown allowed the West Country adventurers new charters in 1661 and 1676, which protected the Western merchants from colonial interference such as that by Kirke. 9

Although  government  remained  hostile  to  colonization,  persistent threats from the French over possession of the island served as a counterweight. The English government accepted some settlement as  desirable,  but  without  the  expense  of  colonial  government.  The capitalist organization of the English fi  shery mixed with the varying social aspirations of its participants to produce a hybrid society. The interrelated resident and migratory fi  sheries depended on hired labour, with servants comprising about 90 per cent of the local population in summer and outnumbering planter families' members by two to  one  during  the  winter.  The  great  merchant-planters  such  as  the Kirkes assumed a gentry-like patron-client relationship with neighbouring smaller-scale planters. The Kirkes used their ability to extend credit to planters and market planters' fi  sh to cultivate the loyalty and fish supplies of their neighbours. Their ownership of boats separated the planter gentry and planters from their hired servants, skilled and unskilled. Smaller planters, however, worked beside their servants, and both depended on the merchant capital of the planter-gentry to fish.  The servants worked for shares and occasionally, if they were very skilled, for fi  xed wages. Cash was always in short supply, but servants were happy to take part of their pay in the tobacco, wine, and other beverages that merchants came by easily in the cod trade. Most servants were the young of West Country artisan, yeoman, and husbandman households who hoped to one day establish their own households either in England or in Newfoundland. Although planters and fi  shers alike did their best to farm as part of their seasonal round of work in Newfoundland, the local ecology would not support the type of commercial farming emerging among the gentry and

producing classes in England, with its concomitant social and political  respectability.  For  people  of  means,  Newfoundland remained a nice place to visit for trading and fi  shing, but it was a disreputable place to settle. 10

English fi  shers faced stiff competition from the French, especially from the port of Saint-Malo, and fi  erce rivalry between the English and French resulted in a regional division of the fi  shery by the 1650s. The English controlled the shore between Bonavista Bay and Saint Mary's Bay. The French fi  shed off the coast north of Bonavista Bay (which they called the Petit Nord), and in Placentia and Saint Mary's bays. The French fi  sheries were lucrative, especially since they could be combined with excursions to Nova Scotia and the Labrador coast for  a  supplementary  fur  trade  with  Natives.  Although  there  were never more than eight hundred or nine hundred people at Plaisance, the French base protected the French fi  shery. Between 1660 and 1680 greater numbers of Basque and Breton ships entered the bank fi  shery and expanded into England's markets in Spain and Italy, protected by tariffs against English competition at home.

The English government knew that some settlement helped hold Newfoundland  against  French  territorial  ambitions.  West  Country merchants favoured imperial spending on the navy rather than colonial fortifi  cations to protect their commercial interests and feared the creation of colonial institutions such as courts, which would have to be paid for by a tax on fi  sh rather than settlement. In 1675 the Board of  Trade  even  asked  convoy  commander Sir John Berry to remove settlers from Newfoundland. Berry could not do so because residents had no means to pay for their return to the British Isles and were so intermingled with migratory fi  shing interests. As early as 1678, West Countrymen who had been long involved in the fi  shery, such as Nehemiah Troute, openly argued in favour of settlement as a means of protecting the property of the migratory fi  shers when they left at the end of the fi  shing season. 11

English fi  shers  likely  feared  the  Beothuks  more  than  the  French. Each spring, the Beothuks came to the coast to hunt seals and gather birds'  eggs  at  about  the  same  time  as  the  fi  rst  fi  shers  from  Europe arrived. The Beothuks and the migratory fi  shermen became competitors for coastal resources, but without a fur trade to alleviate tensions between  Natives  and  newcomers.  Overwintering  Newfoundland fishing  servants  trapped  what  furs  were  available  from  the  small number of fur-bearing animals on the island, but the large number of seasonally abandoned fi  shing premises continued to supply iron for

the Beothuks to take. They did so by burning premises to obtain the thousands of nails left behind that were holding together the migratory fi  shers' boats, stages, fl  akes, and other buildings. This raised the enmity of the migratory fi  shers,  who  found  blackened  rubble  each spring instead of boats ready for the water and fl  akes ready for drying fi  sh. The long-term result was that the migratory fi  shery came to depend on even more settlers to protect its boats and premises. While the English settled the Avalon and the French used the Petit Nord, the Beothuks were relatively unmolested in Notre Dame Bay until well into the eighteenth century. 12

The strengthening of the French presence at Plaisance during the 1690s made it diffi  cult for the Beothuks to harvest resources outside of a relatively small area increasingly pressured by the territorial expansion of many other peoples, both First Nations and Europeans. The Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia were able seafarers who had become one of the most important fur trading partners and military allies of the French. It is possible that Mi'kmaq had been resorting to southwestern  Newfoundland  as  part  of  a  larger  foraging  territory  since the sixteenth century. A few came to Newfoundland as allies of the French in their confl  ict with the English and soon began competing with English furriers on the Avalon Peninsula. By 1690 the English and French were at war again. Anxious to protect their fortifi  ed fi  shing port, the French encouraged more Mi'kmaq to come to the south coast, and many settled close by Plaisance. Over the next twenty years the  Mi'kmaq  and  other  Native  allies  assisted  French  military  campaigns against the English Shore and took a role in raiding English settlements. The Beothuks lost access to much of the south coast of Newfoundland, not through Mi'kmaq hostility, but to overall European encroachments and confl  ict on the coastal areas that were so necessary to their economy. To the north, Innu began visiting the island to trap furs on the Great Northern Peninsula. While Innu may have traded with the Beothuks, there was little opportunity for such in the French and Mi'kmaq forays overland from Plaisance to St John's in the 1690s and 1700s, which used Beothuks' portage routes. The Beothuks retreated from such encroachments on their territory, thereby losing access to the Avalon Peninsula. 13

The  arrival  of  European  fi  shers  in  Notre  Dame  Bay  in  the  early eighteenth century changed the Beothuks' way of life. The Europeans explored the river systems that emptied into the bay, fi  nding bountiful salmon populations to exploit and furs to trap during the winter. The European fi  shing effort not only brought colonists into the last refuge

of the Beothuks near the coast, but also competed with them for the salmon upon which the Beothuks had increasingly relied. In the short term,  the  Beothuks  desperately  attempted  to  defend  their  territory by stealing or destroying Europeans' equipment and even molesting or killing European fi  shers, occasionally beheading their victims for ritualistic celebrations of their victories. Over time, as Europeans retaliated, the Beothuks retreated further into the interior, where they came to rely almost exclusively on caribou for their sustenance, building extensive fencing for the hunt. Their need to store more meat for longer periods of time also meant that they had to invest more effort in preserving and building storehouses. Settlements probably grew around such storage facilities, fostering Beothuk identity and solidarity against the Europeans. Archaeological evidence suggests that they began to engage in ceremonial feasting, and the accounts of later Beothuks captured by settlers suggest that the indigenous people considered cooperation with Europeans as traitorous. Thus, the Beothuks did not simply fl  ee into the interior, but rather chose to retreat there to regroup and take a stand against the Europeans who encroached on their lives. 14

The English government left their three thousand or so settlers in Newfoundland  defenceless  and  without  supplies  when  war  with France broke out in 1690. The fi  shing fl  eet was not permitted to sail until 1694 because of the fear that the navy might be short of sailors. Then, during the winter of 1695-6, French and Native soldiers under the command of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville marched overland from Plaisance to attack English settlements, destroying houses, stores, and flakes, and expelling the settlers in every community except Bonavista in the north. Some settlers fortifi  ed Carbonear Island and successfully held off the French attack there. The poorly supplied French were unable to hold on to the settlements they had taken when an English relief expedition arrived in 1697. Although English offi  cials and merchants might have been satisfi  ed that naval power rather than settlement held Newfoundland for them, this was small comfort to the settlers and merchant capitalists who had lost the labour and capital they had invested locally over a generation. 15

The opportunity for a new policy toward Newfoundland came at the end of the seventeenth century. Many in England continued to believe that only the migratory fi  shery would train men for the navy and stimulate English West Country manufactures, while others argued that English possession of the island depended upon settlement. King William's Act (10 and 11 William III, cap. 25) enacted a compro-

mise between these contradictory ideas in 1699. The act restricted residents' attempts to engross all good shore facilities at the expense of the migratory fi  shery by reserving the areas they usually used. At the same time the act recognized that residents had the right to use property they had before 1685 as well as any land occupied between 1685 and 1698. King William's Act gave most land over to the purposes of residency, except long-time fi  shing ships' rooms. 16

In effect, the act was a compromise between those who wanted settlement and those who feared such settlement might harm the migratory fi  shery. It also provided Newfoundland with its fi  rst offi  cial local court system, confi  rming fi  shing admirals in the informal administrative and limited judicial authority they had previously exercised, and now requiring that the commanders of the naval convoy that cruised Newfoundland waters each summer to become an appellant authority over that of the fi  shing admirals. In practice, naval commanders primarily used their judicial powers to govern the use of wages and credit in the fi  shery, but, although the fi  shing admirals remained by statute  the  most  important  civilian  authorities,  naval  offi  cers  could regulate  the  sale  of  alcohol  and  the  observance  of  Sunday  services among  the  migratory  fi  shing  crews.  Especially  when  the  military threat of the French was strong, the highest-ranking post captain, or commodore, of the naval convoy's authority superseded the authority of the fi  shing admirals. 17

The War of the Spanish Succession (1702-13) demonstrated that the limited English settlements were still vulnerable to attack from Plaisance. The French had captured St John's again in 1709, and the English used their naval superiority to blockade Plaisance. This time, however, the restoration of peace saw the French give up most of their territorial claims in Newfoundland. Although the fi  shery was important to Plaisance, privateering had been one of the most lucrative activities engaged in by the shipowning and mercantile members of the small colony's elite. Peace could secure access to the cod fi  shery, which remained crucial to the imperial economy, but local privateering would only threaten such access. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 established English possession of Newfoundland. France abandoned Plaisance, although a small number of French fi  shing families persisted on the southwest coast of Newfoundland until the 1740s. The French and Mi'kmaq moved to other colonies on Ile St-Jean (now Prince Edward Island), the GaspÃ© Peninsula, and Cape Breton. The French used Cape Breton to protect the maritime approaches to their St Lawrence colony and to serve as a base for their fi  shery, while private traders contin-

ed to visit Newfoundland to engage in illicit trade as well as to fi  sh legally. More important, the Treaty of Utrecht allowed the French to continue in their migratory fi  shery. The French gained the right to fish and use shore facilities on the Newfoundland coast from Cape Bonavista to Point Riche during the fi  shing season (see map 6). AngloFrench rivalries on the American mainland meant that France would lose Cape Breton by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. While France regained the islands of St Pierre and Miquelon off the Newfoundland south coast as a base for its bank fi  shery, some of its former Mi'kmaq allies  in  Cape  Breton  began to leave for occasional visits to St Pierre and, eventually, settlement in Bay d'Espoir on the south coast and St Georges Bay on the west coast of Newfoundland. 18

Treaty rights did not alone guarantee that English fi  shers would prevail over the French. War had sapped much of the labour used by the French in their fi  sheries. Even more important, France's loss of territory in North America had led to an important technological shift in its fi  shery. The French had been using the dry cure that was favoured by the Mediterranean and Iberian markets, but the war had eroded the French resident fi  shery and restricted access to coasts for dry curing. This meant that French merchants had to turn more to a 'green' cure, in which fi  sh was pickled while ships were on the banks fishing.  British  merchants  now  had  an  advantage  in  supplying  the Mediterranean, Spain, and Portugal with the dry-cured product. The old Basque ports and Bayonne continued to decline throughout the eighteenth century, although the ports of Saint-Malo and Granville recovered some of the former ports' business. The merchants of these ports,  increasingly  without  markets  elsewhere  in  southern  Europe, supplied the protected French market through the port of Marseilles. The merchants of Saint-Malo and Granville continued to pursue the green fi  shery on the Grand Banks and the dry fi  shery in inshore Newfoundland waters that was protected by treaty rights. 19

The fi  shery of the English West Country grew under the shelter of the English navy's strengthened position in the North Atlantic. The navy provided greater security in trade, which encouraged the merchants of Bristol and London to concentrate on other trades. The accumulated knowledge among West Country merchants allowed them to  dominate the industry, but they depended more on the resident fishery at places such as Trinity, fi  rst settled in the seventeenth century by a small number of planters. There were still too few settlers to supply enough fi  sh to merchants for export. As a result, a number of West Country merchants established capital and labour-intensive

fishing operations to facilitate their trade. The greater demand for labour led merchants to recruit Irish servants from the ports of Cork, Youghal, and Waterford, where they purchased provisions. Irish merchants who supplied the ships kept an eye open for opportunities to enter the trade; some turned to the fi  shery of Placentia, which had been taken from the French. Since they were now recruiting from the Irish labour market, the people who came to fi  sh there were almost exclusively Irish, and the area around the town became a great centre of Irish settlement. 20

With  little political interference  from  London,  West  Country merchants  and  their  Irish  partners  prosecuted  their  trade  without distinguishing  between  residents  and  migrants.  The  Newmans  of Dartmouth, for example, saw their fi  rm grow during the early eighteenth century through a thriving partnership with a local St John's plantation operated by the Holdsworth family. The fi  rm established a house at Lisbon to oversee its fi  sh marketing and later developed it into a partnership with Poole and other Dartmouth merchants. Just as important was the family's need to establish a St John's operation to manage the Newfoundland side of the trade. The brothers Robert and Richard operated a fl  eet of ten vessels from St John's. In 1757 Robert Newman purchased a substantial plantation at the upper end of St John's  harbour.  In  addition  to  fi  shing  premises,  Newman  acquired meadows, gardens, and dwelling houses there. While merchants such as the Newmans, whether from Dorset, Devon, or Waterford, tended to go to St John's only for the summer fi  shing season, they had invested signifi  cant capital in Newfoundland and recognized the needs of a resident community. 21

The complexity of the fi  sh trade allowed more Irish entrepreneurs into the fi  sh business and made St John's a centre of growing importance. The preference of some of the Irish and West Country partnerships to use St John's as a base indicates the growing importance of that  port  as  a  mercantile  centre.  Other  harbours  of  the  Avalon  Peninsula,  such  as  Ferryland  or  Old  Perlican,  had  much  better  shore facilities  and  local  fi  shing  grounds,  but  St  John's  great  advantage was its location. The port lay roughly in the centre of the Old English Shore, which stretched from Trepassey in the south to Greenspond in  the  north.  Furthermore,  St  John's  fjord-like  natural  harbour  and small opening, the 'Narrows,' was an easily defended berth for naval and merchant vessels alike. Although a diffi  cult passage for any vessel, merchant ships and migratory fi  shing vessels often stopped at St John's at the beginning of the season to gain news of where the

fishery seemed most likely to succeed. As war disrupted the English migratory fi  shery on the Grand Banks, many merchants established branches of their businesses in St John's. These merchants often stationed junior partners in the harbour to deal with planters who established resident fi  sheries along the coastline beyond the Narrows.

St John's central location, and the constant arrival and departure of merchant ships, made the port an ideal choice for Britain's unoffi  cial capital in Newfoundland. From 1697 the English had a military garrison fortify the harbour. More important, throughout the eighteenth century, the naval squadron used St John's as its base of operations. The naval squadron rendezvoused at St John's in the spring before dispersing to patrol the coastline and the western waters of the North Atlantic. The navy brought with it rudimentary religious and government institutions.  In  1697,  the  Reverend  William  John  Jackson  had been stationed in St John's as a chaplain with the naval squadron. Reports of the desire by St John's inhabitants to build a church led to his return in 1701 as a minister at the behest of the Bishop of London. The Church of England did not see Newfoundland as an important fi  eld of activity. While Jackson began to receive support from the Anglicans' missionary vehicle, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG), it showed little interest in Newfoundland after Jackson left two years later. In 1711, Josias Crowe, the commodore of the English squadron, assembled St John's merchants and his other naval offi  cers to develop laws for the better government of local people. Crowe ordered money collected from residents to support the town's new church and clergyman and to provide for local policing and protection of fi  shing rooms. As the non-fi  shing establishment grew, some planters turned from fi  shing to other economic areas such as keeping public houses or taverns. Against the background of a law which was intended to protect the migratory fi  shery, naval offi  cials charged with enforcing King William's Act encouraged the development of government to serve the needs of residents. 22

As settlement continued to grow, residents wanted a fuller administration of justice than provided by the legal regime designed for a migratory fi  shery. Merchants and planters faced problems of enforcing agreements over credit and punishing crime while both the fi  shing admirals and the naval squadron were home in England. Planters and merchants had invested signifi  cant capital in St John's and were concerned by the growing number of servants who overwintered in the town. In November 1723, a group of these prominent residents founded their own court and elected three magistrates. The gather-

ing cited the political philosophy of John Locke to justify the right to create institutions to defend their property. These magistrates, Chaplain John Jago and merchants Samuel Rooke and Allyn Southmayd, heard civil disputes about debt and property ownership, a variety of petty  criminal  cases,  disagreements  between  masters  and  servants, and public nuisances. While most of the people who participated in the court's proceedings, whether defendant or plaintiff, accepted its legitimacy, English authorities did not. This particular court does not appear to have met the next year, but merchants had begun to suggest that the British government appoint magistrates to protect property, and commanders of the naval convoys began to appoint justices of the peace to supplement the fi  shing admirals. 23

The earliest institutions of government in Newfoundland were judicial, but the naval character of government was much different than that of the other English colonies in North America. Both law and custom prohibited taxation in the fi  shery, discouraging the British government from appointing a civil governor and administration which would then have to be paid for out of the imperial treasury. With King William's Act,  naval  commanders had the right to hear appeals of decisions made by fi  shing admirals, and British authorities expected them to counterbalance the authority of the fi  shing admirals. During the War of the Spanish Succession, naval commanders had also assumed duties that might usually have been exercised by a civilian governor, but their primary motivation was to prepare settlements on the English Shore for French attacks. Gradually, after 1729, the English government included in the commanders' commission a vague mandate to enforce British policy. Smuggling, property ownership, and emigration all proved to be problems that demanded some greater presence of government authority at Newfoundland, and a 1729 order-in-council provided the convoy commander, Henry Osborne, with full civil and military authority over Newfoundland. This recognized his right to delegate judicial authority to magistrates during the winter and to subordinate naval offi  cers as surrogates. Newfoundland naval governors, in effect, became the island's chief executive and judicial authority during their presence on the summer station. The fi  shing admirals were unhappy that the navy was assuming authority without parliamentary approval and tried to limit the jurisdiction of the naval governors' magistrates, but England's attorney general confi  rmed the governors' and magistrates' authority. 24

The growth of settlement meant that the naval governors wanted a year-round legal establishment at Newfoundland to deal with crimi-

nal matters. In 1749, the naval governor George Rodney pressed for judicial reform, assuming the duties of a chief justice, a practice followed by future governors until 1781. In 1750, the British government established by order-in-council a Court of Oyer and Terminer at Newfoundland to hear criminal matters, and Rodney made his naval surrogate judges responsible for specifi  c districts. By the 1760s, the naval state consisted of the executive authority resident within the offi  ce of the commander stationed at St John's for the summer. The commanders governed by decrees that were carried out by civil magistrates in nine districts, and by naval surrogates in fi  ve maritime districts which they patrolled in their capacity as commanders of naval ships. Slowly, this naval administration acquired the basic offi  ces of day-to-day government that many settlers would have been familiar with in their home countries: constables, coroners, sheriffs, and grand juries that could make presentments on behalf of local people. 25

While not a colonial administration, naval government was well suited to people spread out in settlements along an immense littoral. Most people abided by English common law, so a police force was unnecessary, and in the last resort the naval commanders could rely on their ships' guns, sailors, and marines to back up their orders and judgments on any part over the coast under their authority. Ships' officers used customary corporal punishment such as fl  ogging aboard ship, and such might be used in sentencing for crimes in Newfoundland.  The  offi  cial  culture  of  the  British  navy  frowned  on  arbitrary discipline that might result in mutiny; offi  cers were professional and disinterested in who won disputes over such things as the allocation of shore space; and the British government 'did not permit the indiscriminate use of military force' in the administration of justice. The ritual and the ceremony of the navy's presence in their harbours further gave settlers a sense of connection to an authority that was above the commercial interests of the fi  shing industry. For the fi  rst time, settlers could have their cases heard by judges who were committed to upholding the customary laws of their communities, as well as statutory law, but who were not the representatives of merchants who gave them credit, bought their fi  sh, or paid their wages.

The justice of the offi  cers was not ideal. The naval government's administration  refl  ected  the  class  divisions  of  the  day.  Court  offi  cers, for example, came from the ranks of the merchants, mercantile agents, and prominent planters who dominated every fi  shing community. The appellant authority of the naval surrogates and the naval governor meant, however, that fi  nal authority lay with naval offi  cers

drawn from the British gentry. These offi  cers, in addition to having no direct interest in the fi  shery, had the status and social and political connections to allow them to face down any recalcitrant merchant. 26 The summary justice and administration of naval government thus gave some order to a settler society continually augmented by more migrant  fi  shers.  Only  some  of  these  fi  shers  stayed  permanently  as residents, but even those who stayed the shortest contributed to the myriad needs of local society.

The population of Newfoundland was growing rapidly. In 1750, the total population of European descent on the island was less than ten thousand and by 1764 had grown to about sixteen thousand. During the summer the population swelled with the arrival of migrant servants, both English and Irish, and then settled back down to smaller numbers during the winter. While the fi  shery paid good wages in comparison with what they earned as labourers at home, working conditions were brutal. The dangers of the sea were many; servants undertook an arduous voyage simply to reach the fi  shery and then would often spend days at sea in small, open craft engaged in hauling baited lines laden with cod. Since masters did not like their servants sleeping while there were fi  sh to be caught, servants might go for days without rest while working in the cold and wet. Buying liquor from their masters and merchants was sometimes the only comfort available and may have left servants indebted at the end of the fi  shing season, thereby forcing them to stay in Newfoundland during the winter to get by as best they could. Other servants may have decided to stay to trap furs to make extra money. 27

The naval offi  cers were alarmed more by the propertyless servants who stayed than by other settlers. Moreover, while estimates of their proportion of the resident population are unreliable, contemporary observers felt that the Irish were becoming the most numerous of the settlers, at least on the Avalon Peninsula. Growing numbers of Irish worried fi  shing masters and naval authorities. Many of the Irish servants spoke only Gaelic, and their mutterings about the conditions of employment and other  complaints  remained  a  mystery  to  masters and  offi  cials.  Harsh  work  and  poverty  gave  the  Irish  good  reason to  be  dissatisfi  ed,  especially  during  Newfoundland's  long  winters. Not all of the Irish were impoverished, and increasing numbers of the  resident  planters  and  merchants  were  of  Irish  origin.  The  class differences that existed among the Irish were small comfort to local offi  cials, however. 28

Most  of  the  Irish  who  migrated  to  Newfoundland  were  Roman

Catholics. They arrived at a time when English Protestant sentiments had been infl  amed by the tensions with France that erupted in the Seven Years War (1756-63). Anxiety about war stirred up long-standing English fears about the infl  uence of 'papacy' within its dominions. In the British Isles, such fears had led to anti-Roman Catholic 'penal' laws limiting property rights, citizenship, and freedom of worship. The pro-Stuart rebellions of 1715 and 1745 renewed anti-Roman Catholic sentiment, spreading even to Newfoundland in 1715, when the governor accused an Irish man at Placentia of hiding refugee rebels. Although the enforcement of the penal laws waxed and waned, the rise of the Hanover monarchs encouraged their vigorous application in England. To assure the loyalty of Roman Catholics who lived within the empire, the government designed an oath of allegiance which required repudiation of the leadership of the pope. After 1745, the governor noted that many of the Irish in Newfoundland refused to take  the  oath.  The  Catholic  (Stuart)  uprising  against  the  Protestant monarchy in Britain failed in 1745 (allowing authorities to relax the application of their anti-Catholic laws) but popular anti-Catholicism increased both in Britain and in Newfoundland. Governors and surrogates feared that the complex class antagonisms of Ireland would accompany  new  migrants.  In  Ireland,  wealth  and  land  ownership rested in the hands of a Protestant oligarchy whose language (which the  Irish  associated  with  English  rule,  oppression,  and  exploitative rents) remained English. The vast majority of the Irish, especially in the areas from which people migrated to Newfoundland, were Roman Catholic, and their language of resistance was Gaelic. 29

The history of the Irish within the British empire meant that imperial offi  cials suspected disaffection wherever Irish settlement concentrated. Not only were an increasing number of the settlers around St John's Irish Catholics but so were many of the soldiers. The naval government's early trial of capital offences, through the court of Oyer and  Terminer,  concentrated  on  the  discipline  of  Irish  soldiers  and fishing servants, although other people appeared before the court as well. The crimes were severe: manslaughter, murder, and gang rape. Usually the accused were Irish, but this was not a guarantee of conviction, and the court pardoned capital sentences in some cases. While spectacular cases might shock authorities, such as the 1754 robbery and murder of prominent St John's merchant and magistrate William Keen by a group of ten Irish men and women (Keen had a history of using his judicial offi  ce to harass the Irish), the Irish had become indispensable to the fi  shery and found ready defenders in West Country

merchants, who did not feel that they seriously threatened the peace in Newfoundland. 30

In both Ireland and Newfoundland, the labouring Irish turned to their clerics for leadership in the fi  ght against exploitation. The disruption of the Irish Roman Catholic Church by the English penal laws meant that priests often served their parishes without the diocesan control of bishops, and a similar situation developed in Newfoundland,  where a generation of itinerant priests claimed to serve their people without the need for permission by bishops to administer the sacraments and acknowledged no higher institutional authority.

The nature of the trade between Waterford and the West Country meant that Ireland played a great role in the formation of Newfoundland society despite the concerns of English authorities. Nevertheless, the  West  Country continued to dominate the Newfoundland trade and, although settlement increased, many people continued to identify with their English places of origin. Their links to home were constantly reinforced: most of the provisions and all of the capital goods required  for  the  fi  shery  came  from  Irish  and  West  Country  ports, although New England ports were becoming more important in the supply of provisions during the eighteenth century. Planters could only acquire labour, provisions, and capital goods by securing them on credit from the West Country merchants.

Class relationships in the fi  shery were complex, but ownership or control over the means of providing credit was clearly the great divide among residents. The fi  shery depended completely on Iberian, Mediterranean, and West Indies markets for the sale of its fi  sh products. Fish sales resulted not in cash but in cargoes of other goods that fi  sh merchants carried to Europe. Almost all of the Newfoundland trade took place on ships built and owned outside of the island, although boats used in the fi  shery might be built locally. The only people with access to enough capital to engage in the export trade were the West Country and a few Irish merchants. These merchants were the only ones who could provide credit to planters and therefore were at the apex of social and economic power. West Country merchants, such as Benjamin Lester of Poole, in Dorset, built thriving trades. Lester was active in the administration of Trinity, the Newfoundland headquarters of his trade. While willing to use his commission as a justice of the peace to augment his authority over local servants and settlers, Lester otherwise took little interest in Newfoundland. Like the naval governors, Lester usually returned to England each winter. 31

Places  such  as  Trinity  were  developing  beyond  the  capacity  of

## 64 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

transatlantic mercantile and naval elites to govern effectively. In Trinity, merchants employed servants directly to catch and cure the fi  sh they traded. In the 1753 summer fi  shing season, for example, Joseph White employed twelve fi  shing boats and ten sailing vessels worked by 213 servants. In winter, White kept on 30 caretaker servants. Even the planters who fi  shed independently of merchants relied on hired labour. These smaller masters still hired on average about 25 servants each in the summer of 1753. The problem with a fi  shery that relied on a great deal of hired labour was its relatively high fi  xed overhead cost, in an industry marked by prices that fl  uctuated widely due to international  factors  beyond  local  control.  Depressed  conditions  in the industry throughout the 1760s meant that most masters dismissed their servants, although no other industries existed to absorb the surplus.  Until  1771,  'masterless  servants'  roamed  Trinity,  committing robberies and other crimes to survive. Newfoundland governors encouraged former masters to return some of the unemployed to Great Britain. The remaining surplus labour appears to have stimulated an offshore bank fi  shery. Despite depression, the number of boats employed in the inshore fi  shery continued to increase between 1750 and 1775. The inshore fi  shery averaged about 175-200 per year employing between 875 and 1,000 servants. This growing inshore fi  shery was probably the result of expanding household production by planters, who could rely on family labour and supplementary farming to lower overhead costs. By 1775, in other words, Trinity was unmistakably a place of settled society, and one of many such communities around the old English Shore. 32

The naval government enjoyed a close relationship with the citizens  of  Atlantic  commerce.  Local  administrative  policy  could  vary considerably from one naval governor to the next, but in the main the governors tended to see themselves as the administrators of a British industry, not a settled society. Governor Sir Hugh Palliser, who fi  rst came as governor in 1764, was determined to restore the dominance of the migratory fi  shery over the resident fi  shery. He had previously commanded the squadron that took St John's back from a French occupation in 1762. His naval experience against the French undoubtedly  made  Palliser  seem  an  excellent  choice  to  British  offi  cials  for governor of Newfoundland. While the Treaty of Paris in 1763 had restored to the French their fi  shing rights in Newfoundland waters between Cape Bonavista and Point Riche, there were modifi  cations that required enforcement. The British government had further agreed to allow France the islands of St Pierre and Miquelon to serve as bases

for its local fi  sheries. It was Palliser's duty to ensure that the French conformed to the treaty by not fortifying the islands or building any facilities other than those necessary for their migratory fi  shery. The governor also ensured that British migratory and resident fi  shers respected the right of the French to fi  sh on the treaty shores. At the same time,  Palliser  defended  British  sovereignty  by  making  clear  to  the French that they were subject to British authority while fi  shing and enjoined the French naval squadron to police smuggling between the French at St Pierre and Miquelon and residents of the south coast. Although the French complained about Palliser, their capable governor of  St  Pierre  and  Miquelon,  FranÃ§ois-Gabriel  d'Angeac,  successfully fended off the worst of Palliser's accusations about treaty violations and did his best to ensure that French colonists' fi  shing efforts did not provoke British hostilities. 33

The residents of Newfoundland were unhappy that Palliser tried to  revive  the  migratory  fi  shery  at  their  expense.  Merchants  complained that the governor had decided to protect the migratory fi  shery by stopping resident merchants' and fi  shers' encroachments on the ships' rooms in St John's for warehouses and stages. Palliser also wanted to stop merchants from advancing too much credit to planters and servants and stranding the latter in Newfoundland by seizing the catches of masters who could not repay their debts. Unpaid servants possessed no means by which they could return home, and imperial policy could not tolerate this threat to a well-trained supply of British seamen, who were also consumers of British-made goods. Palliser proposed that the British parliament should make it illegal for British ships to leave migratory servants behind in Newfoundland at the end of the fi  shing season. During his time as governor, the British did not enact such legislation, but this did not stop the governor from taking matters into his own hands by occasionally ordering masters to pay their abandoned servants' passage home. 34

Palliser further found the development of a settled population disturbing because so many were Roman Catholic Irish. He disliked the fact that Irish Catholics seemed to outnumber English Protestants, and that the Catholics managed to 'have priests secreted among them, to the great disturbance of the peace and good government of the country in the winter season.' Palliser did not allow Roman Catholics to freely  practise  their  religion. 35 He  also  strove  to  discourage  Roman Catholic Mi'kmaq fur trappers from Cape Breton who had begun to settle in St George's Bay and Bay D'Espoir. Palliser feared that these former  French  allies,  and  perhaps  Acadians  who  disguised  them-

selves as Natives, could potentially aid France in resuming its territorial ambitions on the island.

Although Palliser was no friend of the development of Newfoundland, his policy on Labrador unintentionally ensured that it would be maintained as a resource frontier to be exploited by Newfoundland residents. The governor only wanted to make sure that the fi  sheries and seal hunt of the Labrador coast were preserved for the migratory fishery. When Palliser assumed the governorship in 1764, Montrealbased merchants such as Daniel Bayne and William Brymer dominated the trade of the Labrador coast west of the Strait of Belle Isle, while merchants from Jersey and England dominated the trade in the Strait. In 1765, Palliser declared that no colonial interest had a right to property in the valuable seal hunt on the Labrador coast to the detriment of British migratory interests. In 1767, the governor proclaimed that only the fi  rst three ships to arrive from Britain in the major harbours of the coast could leave behind sealing crews for the winter. Palliser had hoped that the British government would agree to his ambitious plans to fortify and defend the coast and subsidize British vessels on migratory fi  shing trips to Labrador. Unwilling to bear the expense, the British government did not agree to Palliser's administrative plans. The Quebec merchants demanded that the British government and courts recognize their property rights and sued Palliser for damages. The case dragged on until 1769, when the Privy Council found for the plaintiff but also declared that Palliser's actions were in keeping with the British government's policy and ordered the government to pay the damages rather than Palliser personally. Palliser had also tried to deny fi  shing ships from the American colonies access to the Labrador coast, but the British government would not support him. 36

Palliser's attempt to limit colonial property rights on the Labrador coast ironically established the basis for settlement that would, in the long run, supersede the British migratory industry there. The governor's  intervention  against  Quebec  merchants  helped  Jersey  merchants such as the DeQuetteville Brothers and West Country fi  rms such as Thomas Bird of Poole and Noble and Pinson of Dartmouth, to establish posts for the salmon fi  shery and sealing along the Labrador coast of the Strait of Belle Isle from Blanc Sablon to Forteau. Palliser's 1765 regulations allowed the fi  rst of these merchants' vessels to reach any harbour the right to maintain crews over the winter to catch seals and whales. The second vessel gained the right of an exclusive salmon fi  shery in the harbour, while the third had the right to trade with  local  First  Nations.  The  Jersey  and  West  Country  merchants

found that sealing, salmon fi  shing, and the fur trade required substantial premises maintained on a year-round basis. They petitioned the Board of Trade for rights to property and year-round residence, which the Board granted in 1773. Within a decade, these fi  rms were bringing hundreds of servants from Jersey, the Bay de Chaleurs, and St John's to work in their industries. Many of these servants began to work on their own account, but continued to trade with the Jersey and West Country fi  rms, so that the migratory and resident fi  sheries on the coast co-existed. 37

To make the coast safe for the migratory fi  shery also required improved relations with the Inuit. The Inuit sometimes raided the southern coastal fi  shing premises, taking boats, weapons, and any tools they found useful. Palliser felt that trade was the key to better relationships; it would give the Inuit the goods they wanted without violence and provide a product for export. The governor turned to the Moravian missionaries, who had long experience in missions among the Inuit of Greenland and knew a similar dialect of the Inuit language. Some of their members had even attempted to establish a mission to Labrador in  1752  but  had  disappeared  during  the  trip.  One  of  the  Moravian brethren, Jens Haven, decided that the mission should try again and secured Palliser's support in 1764. Palliser permitted Haven to issue certifi  cates guaranteeing the Inuit peaceable trade with English merchants and promised naval protection to English traders who chose to deal with the Inuit under the auspices of the Moravians. The Moravians planned to establish missions and open trading posts nearby to entice the Inuit to settle and convert. The missionaries further wanted to  keep  the  Inuit  from  trading  with  others  who  might  abuse  them or give them alcohol. Palliser accompanied four missionaries to the coast in 1765. There he issued a proclamation forbidding the crews of French ships in the fi  shery at Newfoundland, whom Palliser believed encouraged hostility toward the English among Natives, from visiting the Labrador coast to trade with the Inuit. Palliser promised his  government's  peaceful  intentions  and  goodwill  to  a  council  of Inuit at Pitt's Harbour. The Moravians set about to mediate disputes between the English fi  shing on the coast and nearby Inuit; however, some plundering of premises by the latter continued. The governor constructed a blockhouse at York Harbour from which such premises would be guarded by a year-round garrison.

An attack by Inuit on the fi  shing post of London merchant Nicholas Darby at Cape Charles in 1767 led to retaliation by the York Harbour garrison. The garrison killed twenty men and captured nine women

and children who were sent to St John's as prisoners. Palliser sent most of the Inuit back to their people, but kept one woman, Mikak, her son, and one other boy. He sent the captives to England to impress Mikak with the magnitude of English power in the hope that she would communicate the futility of resistance to her people. Palliser and Haven successfully used Mikak, who was an object of great curiosity for the British  aristocracy,  to  get  more  support  for  the  Moravian  Missions from the Board of Trade. In 1769, Mikak returned to her relatives on the coast, having promised Haven and Palliser she would encourage her people to trade with the English and cease travelling to the island of Newfoundland. Mikak soon became the second wife of her sister's husband, Tuglavina.  Inuit  society  was  polygamous,  and  marriages could be dissolved easily. Mikak used her infl  uence to secure local Inuit acceptance of a Moravian mission at the site of what is now Nain and negotiated privileged access to the English for Tuglavina. Mikak eased the meeting of the two peoples and thus prevented a repeat of the sort of violence which had often accompanied earlier attempts. 38

The Moravians established their fi  rst mission at Nain in 1771, paying the Inuit in fi  shing equipment and other tools. The Inuit were quick to adopt useful European technologies but retained the elements of their own technology when there was no better European item. They used wooden boats, which were superior to the multi-person, skincovered boat, for example, while continuing to use the single-person kayak. This prompted economic change as the Inuit diverted hunting effort from food species to fur-bearing animals for trade. The missionaries mingled trade with preaching. Through the 1770s and 1780s the Moravians established successful missions at Okak and other bays. It was the beginning of the integration of the Labrador Inuit into the transatlantic economy and caused signifi  cant changes in their lives. Nain had been a seasonal camp before the Moravians established the mission, but now the missionaries encouraged the Inuit to abandon their nomadic economy and settle there so that they would be able to make it to church each Sunday. Those Inuit who did so had to trade for many of the necessities of life which they had previously provided for themselves. This required breaking with their extended families who lived together and shared resources, and Inuit European-style nuclear families started to live in single houses and to function as single  economic  units. 39 Over  time  this  had  far-reaching  implications. The new diet that included European items was less healthful than their earlier diet, and increased contact with Europeans spread diseases such as smallpox. Sedentary Inuit families adopted Christian-

ity and abandoned practices such as polygamy, although the changes were  slow.  For  all  of  the  cultural  changes  prompted  by  Moravian activity,  their  presence lessened the acts of inter-ethnic violence on which the Inuit had come to be the victims. South of the territory the Moravians were coming to dominate, British traders such as George Cartwright established their own premises partially by forming reciprocal relationships with local Inuit. Such relationships could end in tragedy, as when smallpox devastated the family of Cartwright's associate Attuiock in 1773. Through the activities of furriers, fi  shers, and seal harvesters such as Cartwright, people of European ancestry were becoming familiar with the coast of Labrador and how one might live there. 40

Under Palliser, naval government had become a weapon in the defence of the migratory fi  shery and imperial interests. Although naval government provided rudimentary administration to settlers, it showed little interest in doing more to meet their needs. In the Moravians, Palliser found a church that appeared to advance the greater cause of the preservation of the British migratory fi  shery. The Church of  England,  like  the  Roman  Catholic  and  dissenting  churches,  had taken  little  interest  in  Newfoundland.  The  development  of  British colonial populations through migration and subsequent natural increase forced the churches to pay more attention. The fi  shery had attracted people from the southeast of Ireland, the Channel Isles, and the  English  West  Country.  These  migrants  brought  their  Roman Catholic, Anglican, and dissenting faiths with them. In the absence of a clergy, settlers provided their own ministrations by performing sacraments,  conducting  everything  from  baptisms  to  funerals,  and developing their own informal forms of worship. While the development of settlement drew the institutions and clergy of the churches to Newfoundland and Labrador, settlers were reluctant to give up their own forms of religious observance. Throughout the 1760s and 1770s, even as more clergy arrived, settlers insisted on performing their older religious services, challenging the clergy's sole right to perform and charge fees for the same.

The growth of popular support for lay leadership was a particular problem for the Anglican hierarchy. In towns throughout British North America, the tendency for respectable artisans, shopkeepers, and other members of the middling classes to choose preachers from among themselves fanned the fl  ames of dissent. In St John's, the economic impact of the military establishment helped to foster an artisan and shopkeeping class that was not directly involved in the fi  shery.

Consequently, it is not surprising that local dissenters chose an army paymaster, John Jones, to lead them in prayer. Jones was a successful organizer and moulded his civilian and military followers into a recognizable congregation. Jones's success angered the Anglican missionaries Edward Langman and Walter Price, but to little avail. Jones returned to seek ordination on his own once he had established his prominence in the church life of the port town. As a result of SPG complaints about the laity's religious offi  ciating, Governor Edwards, in 1779, ordered the justices of the peace to restrict the religious ministrations of the lay people. Anglican missions had opened at St John's and Harbour Grace, but the church was less than enthusiastic in its early ministry to the people. 41

Neglected by the more established churches, people in outlying settlements such as on the north side of Conception Bay turned to the Methodists. They embraced Methodism's evangelical popular disillusionment with the older churches' conservatism. The Methodism of  John  Wesley  rejected  the  aristocratic  ritualism  and  hierarchy  of the older Roman Catholic and Anglican churches in favour of a more individual and reasoned explication of faith. In Newfoundland, the Irish preacher Laurence Coughlan, although ostensibly carrying out an Anglican mission in Conception Bay at the request of local merchants in 1766, began to preach a more radical Methodism than that advocated by Wesley. Fishing people in Conception Bay, particularly young women, rallied to Coughlan's message that the individual experience  of  'being  born  again'  was  more  important  to  salvation than one's status in society or position within the more established churches.  Coughlan's  message  was  particularly  appealing  among people who had decided to settle and establish their own household fisheries. For the most part, the merchants upon whom these fi  shing people depended were Anglican and, occasionally, Roman Catholic. Coughlan preached against settlers' taking alcohol on credit and argued for a temperate and frugal life that would lessen dependence on merchants' credit. An itinerant minister, and able to preach in Gaelic, Coughlan eventually built a strong following among Irish settlers on the north shore of Conception Bay. In four years, Coughlan organized his followers through small meetings, often appointing 'common' people to hold services, and building a sense of community in opposition to the merchants and their clerical supporters in the more conservative churches. By 1770, merchants complained about Coughlan, who called his detractors 'the Children of Darkness,' 'the Enemy,' and 'the Children of Disobedience.' Coughlan left Newfoundland three years

later because his failing health had made it impossible for him to bear the harsh climate. The force of his personality, his religious radicalism, and his affi  liation with the SPG meant that Coughlan had established no organizational support for his version of Methodism. Subsequent itinerant preachers kept Methodism alive among the growing population of Conception Bay, but the infl  uence of more moderate Wesleyanism gradually became dominant with the later evangelistic mission by William Black to Newfoundland on Wesley's behalf in 1791. 42

Palliser had been determined to preserve Newfoundland and Labrador for the British migratory fi  shery. Nevertheless, a resident society  of  competing  interests  had  developed,  and,  as  the  growth  of Methodism suggested, its members were beginning to think about how best to pursue their own agendas. Palliser had feared that such a resident society might become as troublesome as the New Englanders, who in the aftermath of the Seven Years War bristled under the taxation  and  restrictions  of  the  British  crown.  For  about  165  years, the English had found that some settlement was necessary to protect the Newfoundland and Labrador fi  sheries from European rivals and aboriginal competitors. Although some English mercantile interests feared that settlers would compete with their migratory trade, and the crown feared the expense of governing settlers, settlement remained limited because of Newfoundland's comparatively poor landward resources. The American Revolution was about to change this and to make Palliser's last-ditch efforts to defend the migratory fi  shery come to naught.

## Not Quite a Colony, 1775-1824

Tied as they were to British interests in the international fi  sh trade, the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador did not join the Americans in their revolution in 1776. However, over the next half-century or so, the impact of the revolution and subsequent upheavals in the North Atlantic world laid the foundations for the triumph of resident interests  and  settlement  over  those  of  the  migratory  fi  shery.  New England had been an important source of provisions for the fi  shing industry, but the revolution forced merchants in the fi  shery to fi  nd alternate supplies in Canada, Nova Scotia, and Europe, and to rely on residents' gardening and livestock for as much food as possible. Confl  ict disrupted the labour supply as well: servants faced the risks of enemy attacks on their vessels or impressment into naval service if  they  continued to work in the migratory fi  shery. Merchants who supplied the migratory trade and the larger vessels, which fi  shed on the banks, thus found labour scarcer and more expensive. Merchants also found access to the best markets in Europe closed by the allies of the Americans in the early 1780s. Similar conditions prevailed during the wars with Napoleon and the War of 1812, although the market conditions of these wars infl  ated the price for salt fi  sh. Postwar recessions led planters to retreat into smaller-scale household production, and merchants to rely on such households' supplementary economic activity to subsidize the fi  sh trade.

The growth of the resident fi  shery fostered the development of a local capitalist class. In 1775 Newfoundland society had consisted of small communities of fi  shing people grouped around the premises of

West Country merchants. These communities were more closely tied to the merchants' home ports in Britain than to each other. The principal partners of these fi  rms continued to reside in Britain but increasingly relied on local agents to manage their supply trade. Even the revival of the migratory fi  shery at the end of the American Revolution did not weaken West Country fi  rms' relationships with residents. Many of the fi  rms withdrew completely from the migratory fi  shery during a 1789 depression in the industry, concentrating exclusively on supplying residents with goods on credit while marketing their fish. As the resident fi  shery grew in importance, West Country merchants found it more diffi  cult to control their agents, who often pursued business interests of their own in Newfoundland. 1

Specifi  c  West  Country  areas,  sometimes  in  association  with  Irish ports,  became  linked  with  particular  areas  of  settlement  in  Newfoundland in the 1780s. Settlers from Trinity northward depended on the Poole fi  rms of Benjamin Lester, John Slade, and Jeffrey and Street. A wider group of Poole, Dartmouth, and Topsham merchants, along with a sprinkling of London, Cork, and other West Country fi  rms supplied the residents of St Mary's and Placentia bays in the south. Bristol merchants dominated the trade of Harbour Grace, while Poole fi  rms were more important in Carbonear. The southern shore of the Avalon Peninsula between St John's and Trepassey was a South Devon preserve,  while the merchants of Dartmouth were the most important in St John's. Together, the merchants of Dartmouth and Poole were the most important in the Newfoundland trade, while the two largest merchant houses were those of Benjamin Lester and Jeffrey and Street. On the Labrador shore of the Strait of Belle Isle, the Jersey fi  rms of Nicolle and LeBoutillier and the West Country fi  rm of Joseph Bird dominated. The agents, or junior partners, of fi  rms who resided in Newfoundland were transatlantic capitalists whose social and political ambitions lay with their city of origin and Britain in general. 2

British authorities were unhappy that the resident fi  shery grew at the expense of the migratory fi  shery during the American Revolution. Imperial  offi  cials  had  by  now  accepted  limited  settlement,  but  the migratory fi  shery had been important for the West Country, Jersey, and Irish economies. British offi  cials feared that an expanded resident fishery would be a market for local capital and labour and would be conducted by potential sympathizers with American republicanism. The British Board of Trade decided to revitalize the migratory trade by taking the advice of former governor Sir Hugh Palliser. He argued that the growth of the resident fi  shery had been caused by merchants'

truck  practices,  which  left  indebted  migrant  labourers  stranded  in Newfoundland at the  end  of  a  fi  shing  season,  unable  to  pay  their passage home. Those servants who worked for resident planters or by-boat keepers might not be paid when fi  sh merchants seized the catches of their masters for debts the latter owed before wages were paid. Either way, servants had to stay over in Newfoundland and over time (see chapter 3) established their own households, often through marrying into already resident planter families. To remedy this, Parliament passed 15 George III, cap. 31 in 1775, subsequently called Palliser's Act. The act required that any servants hired in England must have prearranged, fi  xed wage agreements, in writing, with their masters before commencing the fi  shing voyage. Further, no master could advance more than half the wages in provisions to a servant during the season. The remaining half wages had to be paid in good bills of exchange on the servants' return to England at the end of the season. Masters also had to guarantee return passage.

Palliser's Act, and subsequent Newfoundland judicature acts, also insisted that the law of current supply apply to all those working in the fi  shery. This law gave servants the fi  rst lien against an insolvent or bankrupt master's catch, ensuring they would be paid their wages if their employer died or became insolvent. The second lien went to merchants who had advanced the planter credit in the current fi  shing season. Previous creditors received subsequent liens in the order in which they had extended credit. This new law, known locally as the wage and lien system, strengthened the hand of fi  shing servants in dealing with their masters and merchants. Palliser's Act provided for the imprisonment, whipping, and forfeiture of wages by deserting or negligent servants. Such provisions were in keeping with the criminalization of servants' breach of contract in the Anglo-American law of master and servant, but by the late eighteenth century local courts ignored them in favour of obliging masters to pay wages. Courts in Harbour Grace (the administrative centre for much of the northeastcoast Newfoundland fi  shery), for example, did not imprison or whip negligent  or  deserting  servants.  Servants  almost  always  won  suits against  masters  who  had  denied  them  their  wages,  although  they were less likely to win cases against masters who deducted wages for negligence. Surrogates and magistrates usually asked for smaller deductions by masters in favour of their employees even in cases lost by servants. While the Board of Trade intended Palliser's Act to ensure servants returned home, local courts' rigid enforcement of the wage guarantees transformed the act into a defence of servants' rights. The

administration  of  wage  law,  later  extended  to  the  resident  fi  shery, protected servants more than their masters, making Newfoundland a more attractive place for the propertyless to stay. 3

Palliser's Act failed to discourage the resident fi  shery even as merchants  involved  in  the  fi  shery,  especially  in  St  John's,  came  to  see themselves  as  Newfoundland  residents.  Despite  its  administrative and military importance, St John's had not yet become the local metropolis.  Other  centres,  such  as  Trinity,  Harbour  Grace,  Carbonear, Ferryland, and Placentia served as important merchant outposts of firms which operated a triangular trade, centred in Britain, between Newfoundland, the United Kingdom, and the overseas markets for salt fi  sh. The limited civil expenditures of St John's were of little interest to the local mercantile community. 4

The American Revolution changed this. Conscious of the military imbalance between themselves and the British on the open sea, the Americans  harassed  the  empire  wherever  possible,  including  the Newfoundland fi  shery. Merchants worried about their investment in the bank fi  shery and feared that the garrison in St John's, a company of old men and boys in the Royal Highland Emigrants and a company of invalid artillerymen, could not defend the port. The naval squadron stationed at Newfoundland during the summers had also been reduced in size since 1769, and it faced a daunting task in trying to defend the island, Labrador, and fi  shing vessels on the Grand Banks. From 1776 to 1778, Governor and Royal Navy Vice Admiral John Montagu improved the fortifi  cations at Placentia and St John's, although with the assistance of St John's merchants. The success of American privateers against British ships on the Grand Banks, and the entry of the French on the side of the Americans meant that the British  government  augmented  the  small,  poorly  equipped  naval forces based in St John's. Local artisans and labourers formed a local militia in 1778, which St John's merchants agreed to support as the Newfoundland Volunteers in 1779 (renamed as the Newfoundland Regiment in 1780). Merchants had come to believe that the naval administration of Newfoundland had failed to protect their interests adequately and that they should be entitled to better protection of their property rights in St John's as they took greater steps to defend themselves. 5

The British naval squadron unintentionally preserved the Labrador coast under the effective control of St John's. Quebec merchants had continued to demand recognition of their right to the seal hunt along the Labrador coast, and the British government had warmed to the

overtures of Quebec governor Sir Guy Carleton in 1774. Infl  uential supporters of the navy in the British House of Commons, many of whom were friends of Palliser, unsuccessfully opposed the navy's, and thus the Newfoundland governor's, loss of control over the territory. Under the Quebec Act of 1775, Labrador had again become part of the colony of Quebec, although the rights of British migratory ships to the cod fi  shery continued. Newfoundland naval governors continued to protect the migratory fi  shers on the coast, while the governors at  Quebec found that they had little means to exercise jurisdiction. During the American Revolution control over Labrador fell to the naval authorities of St John's, who also commanded all of the British naval forces throughout the Gulf of St Lawrence and as far south as the Hudson River. As thinly stretched as it was, the naval squadron, under the direction of Governor Edwards, was the only protection that the Labrador coast had. Through 1779 and 1780, the authorities in St John's made the coast more secure against American privateers. At the end of the war, the Labrador fi  sheries from the Strait of Belle Isle eastward and northward had come under the effective government of St John's. 6

The end of war in 1783 saw the readmission of international competitors into the fi  sheries of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Americans  and  their  French  allies  won  the  war;  their  fi  shing  industries suffered as British naval operations had kept both from fi  shing on the banks. Under the subsequent Treaty of Paris with its former American colonies in 1783, Britain allowed New England fi  shers to return to the banks off Newfoundland and Labrador and in the Gulf of St Lawrence. The Americans also gained the right to fi  sh in inshore waters along the British coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Magdalen Islands, and Nova Scotia. By the Treaty of Versailles, signed in the same year, Britain returned to the French their fi  shing rights in Newfoundland, but the boundaries of the French Shore shifted from between Cape Bonavista and Cape St John to between Point Riche and Cape Ray. While British negotiators did not want it stated forthrightly in the treaty language, they conceded to the French an exclusive right to the fi  sheries of the French Shore, and the French continued their possession of St Pierre and Miquelon. 7

By 1788 the British migratory fi  shery, buoyed by high fi  sh prices, had revived, producing almost 52 per cent of the total British catch. But the resident fi  shery was a close competitor, and Palliser's Act encouraged it by declaring as fi  shing ships' rooms all unoccupied land along the shores at Newfoundland, regardless of ancient usage. This

declaration reserved such land for the migratory fi  shery. Further, any land not used for the fi  shery for one full year would revert to ships' rooms. Migratory fi  shermen  were  the  ones  least  likely  to  maintain year-to-year usage of shore facilities, while residents, by their very presence, were more likely to do so. Under the act, the processing of salt fi  sh was the only legitimate use of ships' rooms. Warehouses, shops, and docks for the local carrying trade dominated the St John's waterfront, but these were not used for making fi  sh. Although British houses still dominated the trade, local agents of these fi  rms, like residents, knew that they held such property only at the pleasure of a governor's willingness to believe they used it for the fi  shery. In 1784, Governor Campbell was increasingly concerned about the congested St John's waterfront and faced a good deal of animosity from St John's residents when he tried to survey the ships' rooms. Over the next fi  fty years, discontent with the naval governors' attempts to regulate the alienation of ships' rooms to raise revenue for the expense of local government  undermined  St  John's  merchants'  confi  dence  in  naval government. 8

As the American Revolution destabilized West Country participation in the trade, more Irish and Scottish fi  rms entered the fi  shery. From Waterford and Ross came the Irish fi  rms of Ryan, Keough, Eustace,  Meagher,  Sweetman,  and  Morris.  An  occasional  Scottish  sack ship had carried provisions to trade at Newfoundland for fi  sh to sell in Iberian markets as early as 1726. However, Scottish merchants became seriously interested in the Newfoundland trade from the 1760s with the growth of the Clyde and Ayreshire deep sea trades. Merchants  from  Greenock  and  Glasgow  began  to  carry  manufactures from Scotland to sell in Newfoundland. The Scottish merchants concentrated  in  St  John's  and  northeast-coast  centres  such  as  Harbour Grace and Bonavista, while the Irish fi  rms developed trade from St John's to Placentia Bay. 9

The Irish and Scottish fi  rms drew on residents' experience in the fish  business  rather  than  relying  on  partnerships  with  West  Country  fi  rms.  Scottish  merchants  supplied the provisions and access to markets  that  were  already  part  of  their  colonial  trades;  they  were more likely to provide credit to new residents as they tended to be less committed to long-term relationships with existing suppliers of salt cod. People in the trade referred to the new merchants as 'dealers' to distinguish them from the old West Country 'merchants.' The Scottish merchants found St John's a convenient place from which to deal, and they reached out even into the territory of the West Country

firms. Irish merchants in St John's invested in huckster shops to supply the consumer needs of the Irish servants who came to the area. They also invested in public houses, which comforted servants with a warm meal, a drink, and a smoke away from the eyes of their masters. Most provided services to the people of St John's in return for the bills of exchange servants earned in the fi  shery, or by taking fi  sh in payment directly. By the turn of the century, these Irish and Scottish firms competed with the West Country fi  rms of St John's to such an extent that the latter survived by retreating into their outport operations. Firms such as Robert Newman and Company closed their St John's premises to specialize in the supply trade among the growing number of resident fi  shers on the south coast of Newfoundland. 10

Merchants' origins could set them apart from each other. Roman Catholic  merchants  from  Ireland,  for  example,  were  mortifi  ed  that the authorities might consider them the same as Roman Catholic Irish fishing servants. Truck credit practices, the dangers of working on the sea, and poor opportunities for local farming were more important than ethnicity and religion in determining the harshness of such servants' lives. They turned not to the offi  cial structure of the church, but rather to itinerant priests for leadership, whether in faction fi  ghts to control access to employment in a particular fi  shing community, or in making public their grievances with merchants. The activities of the itinerant Irish priests had so embarrassed Catholic merchants that they had petitioned the church in Waterford and London to send a bishop to bring the priests under control. In 1783, Catholic merchants in St John's sent a deputation to Waterford to look for a suitable church leader.  They  wanted  one  from  the  conservative  clergy  of  the  Irish church who had resisted middle-class radicals in exchange for British state support of the church. The answer to merchants' prayers came when James Louis O'Donel, who had been born into a prosperous Tipperary farming family in 1737, became Prefect Apostolic in 1784. His family had provided the classical education that allowed him to enter the priesthood and to fi  t in with the English establishment. Although O'Donel's function was to make the church an instrument of class rule, he continued to face opposition from 'strolling' priests of the people, such as the Dominican Patrick Lonergan, who sided with fishing servants in their disputes with merchants. 11

O'Donel had arrived just as the growth of residence made many merchants more aware of just how important local government was to  their  interests.  Through  the  late  1780s,  merchants  pressured  the government  to  provide  St  John's  with  more  constables  and  better

regulation of its many public houses. Governors, in turn, wanted the merchants to help out with government fi  nances, because their legislative grants from Britain fell short of the expenses of regulating a resident population. The issue came to the fore in 1789, when a transport ship destined for the mainland colonies dumped a large number of  Irish  convicts  in  Newfoundland.  Governor  Milbanke,  without funds to feed and house the convicts until they could be transported out of Newfoundland, asked the St John's merchants to help. They agreed to provide food but stopped short of paying half of the cost of transporting the convicts out of the island. Without real property to tax, the merchants agreed only to a voluntary tax on fi  shing vessels. Local magistrates handled the convicts on behalf of the governor and inhabitants, and collected taxes in the form of fees and duties for the construction of basic public works such as jails. Irish authorities claimed that the governor of Newfoundland had no right to transport the convicts back to Ireland because, in their opinion, they had been sentenced to transportation to a British colony. British authorities defended Milbanke by reiterating Newfoundland's lack of colonial status, although a local government had coped with a diffi  cult problem. 12

O'Donel and his priests worked to ensure that local offi  cials would not be troubled by Irish residents as they had been by the convicts. They were joined by Thomas Yore, or Ewer, in 1788, who took up the  pastoral  duties  of  the  Ferryland  district.  Yore  became  the  merchants' champion in a fi  ght against another radical priest, the Franciscan Patrick Power, who came to St John's well recommended from the church in Ireland in 1787. Power supported fi  shing families from the south shore of the Avalon Peninsula who complained about mistreatment by merchants. Power's infl  uence extended to the Ferryland district and drew the ire of Yore. Local fi  shing servants tended to be from Leinster or Munster and frequently found it diffi  cult to fi  nd employment in the fi  shery. Yore, also from Leinster, encouraged faction fighting between his countrymen and those from Munster to divide the supporters of his fellow Franciscan, Power. Even as he encouraged faction fi  ghting, Yore vocally supported local merchants, with the full blessing of O'Donel. O'Donel's actions drew the ire of two bishops in Ireland, James Lanigan of Ossory and William Egan of Waterford, who both felt that the clergy should be fi  ghting for the betterment of all of the people in their pastoral care. O'Donel was steadfastly with the  merchants.  By  1791,  their  united  opposition  drove  Power  from Newfoundland. The Irish Catholic merchants of St John's were suit-

ably grateful;  they  had  been  paying  O'Donel's  salary  of  Â£1,500  per year and invited him to dine with them and the governor to celebrate his victory over Power and the fi  shing people of the area. 13

The days when Newfoundland's civil needs could be met by paying  a  bishop's  salary,  or  voluntary  subscriptions  and  supplements from the governors' resources, were coming to an end. The resumption of trade with the United States fuelled more growth in St John's, where merchant fi  rms competed with English houses for the trade of outport planters. The St John's economy grew even more as residents opened  more  public  houses  and  taverns  to  profi  t  from  satisfying thirsty  and  hungry soldiers and fi  shing  servants.  The  construction, maintenance, and operation of new warehouses, wharves, stores, and other mercantile premises as well as military fortifi  cations brought more tradespeople, labourers, and smaller retailers and merchants to the port. By the turn of the century, the wars with Napoleonic France disrupted the migratory fi  shery even more, further encouraging the metropolitan development of St John's. By 1795, artisans such as carpenters, coopers, tailors, hairdressers, and shoemakers accounted for between 100 and 150 of the household heads of St John's, far more than the less than 25 planters and boatkeepers (property-owning fi  sh producers) or the approximately 50 merchants and their agents. Such artisans faced insecure tenure in their waterfront property under Palliser's Act, although some, such as prominent watchmaker Benjamin Bowring, cooper John Job, and tailor Thomas Meagher, could take up property on the waterfront because they moved into the merchant business.

Other artisans, and many merchants, wanted legal reform that would grant  them  more  security  of  property,  in  keeping  with  the  greater complexity of St John's and of the island generally. Newfoundland's lack of a population of independent farmers and gentry meant that imperial authorities would not grant it the forms of colonial self-government that had developed in other British colonies. Under Palliser's Act, the naval governor, his surrogates, and the Courts of Session and of Vice Admiralty administered the law in the fi  shery. The courts of civil jurisdiction which had emerged after 1728 continued to exercise summary justice, but popular satisfaction with them declined as the migratory fi  shery expired. The increasing residence of West Country merchants, or their agents, and the more complex nature of their trade and credit relationships with fi  shermen, meant that people began to challenge the courts' jurisdiction. 14

The complex commercial transactions in the resident fi  shery and

the St John's trade required more than the attention of a naval government during the summer, supplemented by a year-round magistracy and surrogate naval judges. Various merchants' challenges of local judicial authority led the British government to appoint John Reeves to  make recommendations for judicial reform. A fellow of Queen's College and legal adviser to the Privy Council on trade, Reeves became chief justice of Newfoundland's new Supreme Court in 1792. At heart a conservative defender of the moral principles of eighteenthcentury gentry society, Reeves believed that merchants wanted to let nothing interfere with their power over fi  shing people. 15 On Reeve's advice, the British parliament, between 1791 and 1808, established a new court of civil judicature for Newfoundland. Originally enacted by 31 Geo III c. 29 in 1791, this new Supreme Court at St John's, presided over by a chief justice, had full authority in matters of debt, personal property contracts, other property disputes, and wage disputes. The British government intended the Supreme Court to enforce the general policies of King William's and Palliser's Acts, but the court established some civilian control over naval government, especially as it had become the appellant authority of the surrogates and other lower courts, which began to draw more on civilian personnel. The 1791 act also provided the fi  rst clear means of settling debts, recognizing the primacy of the wage lien and current supplier provisions embedded in Palliser's Act. The Supreme and Surrogate Courts exercised all authority in civil matters; the Admiralty Court, while retaining its rule over maritime affairs, no longer had the right to hear disputes involving seamen's wages. The Courts of Session continued but were restricted by the new legislation to hearing wage contests and disputes over small debts. While the naval governors continued to appoint surrogate judges, the offi  ce of chief justice had signifi  cant executive power. By 1802, the chief justice became the ranking British civil offi  cial at Newfoundland and therefore the head of local government during the winter when the governor was absent. 16

Reeves's study of Newfoundland property law set in motion events that challenged the authority of naval government by threatening the informal property rights enjoyed by St John's developing mercantile bourgeoisie. The principle of continual occupancy articulated in Palliser's  Act  undermined  land  titles  established  by  possession  before 1685 under King William's Act. Reeves asserted that no secure real property rights existed in St John's, only more informal ones based on occupancy or the governor's pleasure. The decline of the ship fi  shery at St John's, and growing mercantile pressure on the waterfront,

meant  that  merchants  routinely  encroached  on  both  fi  shing  ships' rooms and other unused space for their stores, warehouses, and other facilities while governors looked the other way. Governors had to accept that public opinion favoured this informal engrossment of waterfront property, and Reeves felt titles in grant or occupation must force government to recognize St John's residents' right to sell, lease, or mortgage property. Such recognition would allow the government to tax property to pay for a better civil establishment. Reeves called for a Newfoundland council made up of fi  ve justices of the peace, fi  ve merchants, fi  ve fi  shermen, and fi  ve others with the chief justice and two assessors to advise the governor. 17

British offi  cials did not believe that Newfoundland needed such a council or a law of real property to provide the revenue of an expanded civil  administration.  They still  hoped  that  the  migratory  fi  shery would revive and believed that the dependency of resident and migratory fi  shing interests on the empire to encourage and protect their transatlantic trade meant that Britain did not have to fear their disaffection.  Nonetheless, the French Revolutionary (1792-9) and Napoleonic (1800-1, 1803-15) wars strengthened the St John's bourgeoisie. The wars prevented the French, and later Americans, from fi  shing in Newfoundland waters, disrupted the Newfoundland residents' competitors in the trade, and led to an increased demand for cod. All of these benefi  ted the resident fi  shery, while naval hostilities disrupted the migratory fi  shery. 18

Word of the revolution in France led local merchants to support a new militia, the Royal Newfoundland Volunteers. While the French continued to be a threat, as when they pillaged and burned Bay Bulls in 1797, merchants had more to fear from a mutiny aboard one of the British naval vessels, the HMS Latona ,  sent  out to protect the Newfoundland fi  shery. The Latona mutiny was part of the larger 1797 naval  mutinies  at  Spithead  and  the  Nore,  as  sailors  rose  in  a  Jacobin and United Irish-infl  uenced protest against low wages, brutal working  conditions,  and  military  discipline.  Governor  Waldegrave  and local merchants feared the mutiny would spread to the Newfoundland Regiment, a locally recruited regular army unit of fencible infantry.  Offi  cials  held  unfounded  views that the Irish Roman Catholics in  Newfoundland,  who  provided  most  of  the  enlistments  for  the Regiment, were always on the verge of treason in collusion with the French, but there is little evidence to suggest that the mutineers were overtly  political.  Instead,  the  mutineers  rebelled  against  their  poor working conditions and poverty, clad in the rhetoric of wider pro-

tests popular throughout the empire. Members of St John's Protestant merchant families constituted most of the Regiment's junior offi  cers, and the Regiment joined the Volunteers in suppressing the mutiny, but not before many wondered which side the Irish soldiers would support. 19

The Latona mutiny again raised the issue of the need for a greater civil establishment and local real property rights. Waldegrave recognized that St John's merchants and other members of its bourgeoisie expected secure rights to the property they defended. However, Waldegrave felt  that  the  naval  government  needed  only  to  extend more civil authority for poor relief rather than support real property rights or colonial status. Such relief would defuse Irish discontent and forestall any attack on the social order of St John's. The governor had no interest in acknowledging that St John's inhabitants treated their property as if they had real rights but wanted to fi  nd ways to tax them for poor relief and other local expenditures. Conscious of their lack of property rights, St John's merchants began to confront Waldegrave and his successors over efforts to regulate access to property and attempts at taxation in the absence of formal real property rights. 20

Popular anger at the gross inequalities between classes in St John's prevented  merchants  from  openly  condemning  the  naval  government. Poorly treated Irish servants in the Royal Newfoundland Regiment eventually rose up against their exploitation by local merchants and their poor treatment in the regiment. On 24 April 1800, nineteen soldiers tried to revolt, using the United Irish cry of 'Death or Liberty.' Authorities quickly rounded up the mutineers, summarily tried and executed some, and sent others to Halifax for court martial. Rumours circulated around St John's that as many as four hundred residents supported the United Irishmen, planning to plunder and burn the premises of the respectable citizens. The St John's merchants formed night patrols to watch the town's Irish Roman Catholics and rallied behind British authority, welcoming martial law and the sixty-sixth regiment from Halifax. 21

The rising of 'common' servants, soldiers, and sailors demonstrated that Irish labourers had become a political force that neither the naval authorities nor merchants alone could ignore. They turned to Roman Catholic Bishop O'Donel's infl  uence to discourage rebellion, seeing any support for the United Irishmen as sympathy for the French and treason against the laws of England. In doing so, O'Donel secured his position as a member of the Newfoundland elite and protected the Roman Catholic Church from having the governor enforce the more

draconian elements of the English penal laws. Indeed, when a mild stroke forced O'Donel's retirement in 1804, local merchants supported the British government's granting him an annual pension. In 1807, O'Donel left Newfoundland, having secured a promise from his successor Patrick Lambert that the new bishop would continue to contain the discontent of Irish fi  shing people. As a fi  nal gesture of appreciation, the merchants of St John's gave O'Donel a valuable silver urn. 22

St John's merchants were locked in a more uneasy relationship with the naval governors. On the one hand, they depended on the governors as well as bishops to protect their material interests. On the other hand, they resented the governors' efforts to tax their businesses. Governors Gambier and Gower were determined to charge quit rents on leased property to pay for a greater Anglican Church establishment and charitable schools for children of the poor. The governors hoped that the schools would protect St John's social hierarchy by instilling British loyalty and order among St John's rougher classes. Although the governors accepted that the merchants should have real property rights, the property owners resented being asked to pay for an administration. After 1800, the debate between the St John's bourgeoisie and the governors was not about individual rights to engross private property, but about the type of administration that should tax or rent such property, and what policies it should pursue. Merchants' civicmindedness  left  much  to  be  desired;  they  crowded  the  waterfront with poorly constructed buildings without regard for fi  re safety and sanitation. Some earned such high rents from artisan and petty-trade tenants that the governors felt they should be taxed for civic purposes. However, merchants felt that they had demonstrated responsibility in supporting the militia and that they should have some say over the government that would use their money. Governor Gower was sympathetic and thought that the merchant-dominated St John's grand jury should have some control over spending on poor relief, roads, jails, and other municipal needs. But he stopped short of suggesting a colonial legislature should gain control over the funds he proposed to raise from leases. 23

Wartime economic conditions lessened merchants' concerns about more control  over  government.  For  most  of  the  1790s,  war-related economic disruption had caused low fi  sh prices but infl  ated the price of just about everything else. War with France in 1793 decisively disrupted British migratory production. The resident fi  shery again fl  ourished, eventually spurred on by the 1807-8 American Embargo Act, and the War of 1812, which limited the otherwise formidable compe-

tition of the new American cod fi  shery. The British invasion of Spain opened peninsular markets to Newfoundland fi  sh and encouraged rising  prices.  While  wartime  infl  ation  affl  icted  residents,  the  ready supply of Irish labour helped to offset planters' wage costs that had been  rising  due  to  war-related  shortages  of  West  Country  labour. Even during the hard times of the wars, resident planters had found that they could further diversify their economic activities by engaging in the seal hunt, trapping furs, logging, and building more boats for the resident fi  shery. As the fi  shery improved, but with the migratory trade all but fi  nished, merchants advanced more credit to some of these planters. With this credit, some planters began to invest in schooners, vessels much larger than the boats they had previously used in the inshore fi  shery. Planters could use these schooners to sail for the rich fi  shing grounds of the north shore, or those parts of the Newfoundland coast usually held by the French under treaty right. Hostilities  excluded  the  French  from  such  shores,  and  the  planters filled the beaches. 24

These planters hired a lot of labour, but this did not change the nature of the resident fi  shery. Most planters continued to be year-round settlers who relied on the labour of their families and perhaps a servant or two hired for a share of the catch. Notwithstanding improved conditions  in  the  fi  shery,  planters  who  built  schooners  and  hired servants found credit to be expensive, and wage rates were high, but they could sustain this only as long as the good fi  sh prices of wartime continued. As some planters borrowed more money, a greater division of labour developed among them. Some took their schooners to the north shore but concentrated only on catching fi  sh. Such planters did not dry their fi  sh but shipped it back to their home ports, where other planters specialized in hiring labour to dry it for export. More perceptive planters, especially from Conception Bay, saw that merchants were doing well and tried their hand at the trade themselves. Such planters did not have the resources to engage in the import and export trades, but they could become the agents and dealers for those who could. These agents or dealers used their schooners to carry other fi  shers to the north shore, where they fi  shed with their families for the summer just as they had on their own shores in Conception Bay. The planter-agents or dealers provided these fi  shers with passage and supplies on credit and carried them and their fi  sh and oil back at the end of the fi  shing season, again on credit advanced against the sale of their catch. 25

St  John's merchants still hoped for a settlement of their rights to

property in ships' rooms on the waterfront. The most recent governor, Admiral Holloway, had decided to enforce the law restricting merchants' access to these rooms. The friendship he struck up with James Macbraire, a northern Irish merchant who had become a prominent member of the St John's mercantile community, meant that Holloway accepted  the  merchants'  use  of  ships'  rooms.  In  return,  Macbraire, and the other merchants involved in the Society of Merchants, formed in  1807,  sided  with  the  governor  in  his  disputes  with  Chief  Justice Thomas Tremlett. The problem of relying on the personal whim of a governor came to the fore when Holloway's successor, Admiral John Duckworth, used ships' rooms leases to pay for schools, police, fi  refighting, and other civic purposes. In 1811, the British government, acting upon Duckworth's recommendation, passed the Ships Room Act, which allowed the governor to lease unused ships' rooms but without  requiring  him  to  recognize  merchants'  previous  encroachments on them as real property. 26

Although discontent with naval government persisted in St John's, it continued to provide rudimentary administration to the other communities spread out over a long coastline. The career of Lieutenant David Buchan shows the range of duties within the domain of naval  government.  Buchan  attempted  to  establish  relations  between the Newfoundland administration and the Beothuks camped at Red Indian Lake. As fur trappers continued to move into areas of Notre Dame Bay used by the Beothuks as winter refuge, confl  ict between the two peoples worsened. Throughout the last decade of the eighteenth century there had been attempts by local settlers to capture Beothuks who might be trained in the English language and to act as intermediaries between the two peoples. These attempts at abduction, as well as fishermen's brutal retaliatory raids on Beothuk encampments, could only make the Beothuks less receptive to overtures from the government.

Governors' previous attempts to use furriers such as William Cull to  establish  contact  with  the  Beothuks  failed  miserably.  Governor Duckworth, on his arrival in Newfoundland in 1810, and with the support of the local Methodist Missionary Society, attempted to do better.  Duckworth  selected  Lieutenant  Buchan,  who  commanded HMS Adonis , to seek out the Beothuks. Buchan arrived in Notre Dame Bay in January 1811, equipped an expedition from his crew with trade goods, and set out with Cull and two other local men as guides. On 23 January, the expedition encountered a band of Beothuks on the shores of  the  frozen  Red  Indian  Lake.  Although  Buchan  tried  to  convince

the Beothuks of his good intentions, the long history of poor relationships with the British, together with the presence of Cull, meant that he was unsuccessful. The expedition ended in disaster, as some of the Beothuks killed two marines in Buchan's party, decapitating them, likely as a ritualistic symbol of victory. Although the deaths of two marines had marred the expedition, Duckworth accepted Buchan's proposal to try to make contact with the Beothuks again in 1812 as they hunted among the islands of Notre Dame Bay. Although years of armed reprisals and kidnapping attempts had made friendly contact between the English and the Beothuks unlikely, Buchan was determined to capture a Beothuk to train as an emissary. Buchan's subsequent expedition was cut short by the outbreak of war between Britain and the United States in 1812. Sadly this was not the last ill-conceived attempt to establish a dialogue with the Beothuks. 27

While  the  naval  government's  attempt  to  establish  relationships with the Beothuks failed, Duckworth's policies for St John's were not doing much better. His position on leasing ships' rooms continued to frustrate St John's merchants, even after he left the island at the end of the 1811 fi  shing season. Merchants, along with a growing number of professionals, wanted a local Board of Police to ensure that the substantial revenues from ships' rooms leases would be spent on local roads, a police force, the lighting and widening of existing streets, a marketplace, schools, and poor relief. One of these professionals, the surgeon William Carson, aggrieved because Duckworth forbade his attempt to establish a farm, condemned the arbitrary authority of naval government. He demanded self-government through a popularly elected  legislature,  as  existed  in  the  neighbouring  colony  of  Nova Scotia. Local merchants such as Macbraire felt that Carson went too far in his strident attacks on Duckworth. They especially disliked the manner in which Carson depicted himself as the champion of popular rights and were happy enough to stop short of the potentially expensive burden of colonial self-government. Macbraire felt that judicial reform would be suffi  cient to meet merchants' particular concerns. 28

Outside of St John's the limited ability of naval government to provide good civilian administration was becoming more apparent. St John's merchants could easily appeal decisions by lower courts to the Supreme Court. In the outports, authority over civil matters lay with the surrogates, accompanied by two justices of the peace, but the Supreme Court, and no longer the governor, was now their appellant judicial authority and administered criminal law. The Courts of Session could still hear wage and debt disputes, but only the surrogates could

issue  writs  in  cases  of  insolvency  or  rule  on  the  customs  and  laws governing wages and credit in the fi  shery. Magistrates often served as government administrators, collecting duties and linking the outports with the governor at St John's as a sort of rudimentary local government. Some magistrates, such as Lewis Anspach in Conception Bay and John Bland of Bonavista, had reputations for being beyond mercantile infl  uence and for serving as reliable sources of information for the government in St John's. However, the authorities doubted the independence of most magistrates from local merchants. Although the governors technically exercised a great deal of infl  uence over the administration of justice, they preferred to devolve responsibility for the supervision of the surrogate judges onto a 'Supreme Surrogate,' a  justice  of  the  peace  with  an  offi  cial  salary  and  the  power  to  hear cases all over Newfoundland. Although senior naval offi  cials tried to distinguish their civil and military responsibilities in Newfoundland, government continued to appear very much as a naval institution. 29

The  limits  of  naval  government  became  apparent  in  1815  with the end of the wars with Napoleon. Postwar depression struck the island  as  war-related  high  prices  in  the  fi  shery  collapsed.  As  early as  the  spring,  merchants  and  planters  began  to  reduce  the  scale  of their operations dramatically. Irish servants continued to pour into St  John's,  hoping  to  fi  nd  work,  but  there  was  little  work  available, and that only at low wages. The Irish organized into rival Leinster and Munster gangs. The gangs attempted to control the local labour market through pacts, refusing work unless paid a minimum wage. Fights broke out as the Leinster and Munster gangs disagreed about who had a right to work, and at what price. Another strolling Franciscan, John Power from Munster, had come to Newfoundland in 1808. Power antagonized Bishop Lambert, but endeared himself to the Irish servants generally by forming a liaison with a woman and travelling about the northern outports conducting himself as a common man. The current governor, Keats, wanted the church to get rid of Power, whom Lambert had already suspended. Lambert and his loyal priests were Leinstermen; the dispute with Power infl  amed the faction-fi  ghting. The divisions among the Irish frustrated their attempt to regulate the labour market. By the summer of 1815 the gangs had collapsed, and those who could fi  nd work received only half the wages paid by planters in 1814. 30

The  economic  problems  underlying  the  gang  rivalry  worsened during the winter of 1816-17. The year started badly when a disastrous  fi  re  swept  through  more  than  130  St  John's  homes  and  mer-

chant premises in February 1816. The continued absence of imports of cheap provisions from the United States aggravated unemployment and poor wages in the fi  shery. Merchants further restricted credit to planters, causing distress in fi  shing households. The Court of Sessions in Harbour Grace ordered unemployed servants to report to St John's for shipment out of the island or be fl  ogged and jailed. Unemployed servants,  mostly  Irish,  in  St  John's,  Carbonear,  and  Harbour  Grace formed bands that rioted for relief and broke open merchant stores to seize food. Authorities preferred to think of the rioters as a disorganized rabble, and called them 'Rals,' an Irish term for rascals. Despite the  best  efforts  of  Lambert's  successor  as  Roman  Catholic  bishop, Thomas Scallan, to keep the servants quiet, the rioters displayed discipline  and  organization,  taking  only  the  food  they  needed  to  survive. Scallan continued to press for more political rights for Roman Catholics, suggesting that this would calm discontent, but such rights would not feed empty stomachs or put money in the pockets of distressed servants. 31

The  governor,  Francis  Pickmore,  had  left  Newfoundland  for  the season, and the responsibility for dealing with this 'Winter of the Rals' fell to Captain David Buchan as the senior naval offi  cer and surrogate. Pickmore had hoped that Buchan could use public works to employ some servants and deport the rest. Buchan did not have the revenue to spend on public works, realized he did not have the legal right to deport people simply for being unemployed, and issued naval stores to relieve distress. Many servants continued to fl  ock to St John's because it offered some hope of work in areas outside the fi  shery. Such hopes were unfounded. Increased military spending and the growth of  the  resident  fi  shery  had  encouraged  the  town's  economic development during the wars. The town had acquired other trappings of an administrative centre: the government had established an offi  cial newspaper, the Royal Gazette , along with a printing offi  ce in 1807 and a post offi  ce in 1809. Like the outports, however, St John's prosperity depended on the fi  sh trade, and it too suffered in the wake of war's end. Another disastrous fi  re in November 1817 made life even more diffi  cult for people in the port, and the return of the French and Americans to the fi  shery meant that fi  sh prices were unlikely to improve. 32

The effect of international relations in the fi  sheries on British subjects  residing  in  Newfoundland  encouraged  local  offi  cials  such  as Buchan to think about how the resident fi  shery  might  be  reorganized to survive postwar depression. Although the treaties of Paris in 1814 and 1815 between Britain and France returned to the latter its

fishing rights in Newfoundland as they had existed in 1792, it had become  clear  that  Newfoundland  residents  expected  a  concurrent right to fi  sh off the French Shore. France nonetheless insisted on its exclusive right and returned in full force as a major competitor in the cod fi  shery.  American competition also returned, although the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 deprived the Americans of their rights  to  fi  sh  within  three  marine  miles  of  the  Newfoundland  and Labrador coastline, thereby excluding them from a shore-based fi  shery. New England fi  shers increased their fi  shing effort on the banks adjacent to Newfoundland and Labrador, driven by the opportunities of the expanding domestic American market and the need to provide more employment to local farming and fi  shing households. While the Americans could not use the shores of Newfoundland and Labrador for fi  sheries, the same was not true for residents' fellow colonists from Nova Scotia. Fishing fl  eets from Lunenburg increasingly resorted to the Labrador coast in search of new fi  sh stocks to exploit, using local shores to dry their fi  sh as did Newfoundlanders, but also expanding their schooner fi  sheries on the banks off Newfoundland. Everywhere they turned, resident Newfoundland and Labrador fi  shers faced more competition even as international fi  sh prices declined. 33

Competition in the Labrador fi  shery was a problem for British fi  shers at Newfoundland and Labrador. Many planters survived the depression  by  retreating  into  household  production,  but  some  of  the better off survived as dealers for merchants, carrying fi  shing families to  the  coast  of  Labrador.  The  growing  importance  of  the  Labrador fishery had led British authorities to return jurisdiction over Labrador to Newfoundland in 1809. There Newfoundland planters could fi  sh as they had on the north shore, which had been returned to the French under treaty rights, but the fi  shing season was shorter, the voyage longer, and the conditions for drying fi  sh poorer. To keep their schooners occupied at Labrador while waiting to carry back passengers and catches, planters had their schooner crews fi  sh as well, paying them in a share of the catch. The business that kept these planter-dealers and agents afl  oat, however, was their supply of credit (as intermediaries of larger merchants) to those who relied on household production in the inshore fi  shery. Even more important, the planters who owned schooners found that they could make money by using their schooners in an expanded spring seal hunt. The profi  ts of the seal hunt offset the persistence of low prices in the cod fi  shery, so much so that it is doubtful that residents would have survived without them. While the

seal hunt allowed residents to persist, it did not allow many to prosper as depressed conditions in the cod trade prevailed. 34

The British government hoped that the patriarchal authority of the household  organization  in  the  fi  shery,  prosecuted  largely  by  family  labour,  would  offset  social  problems  caused  by  such  depressed conditions  and  foster  greater  social  order.  David  Buchan  had  left Newfoundland  for  two  years  after  the  winter  of  1816-17,  staying in England when not on expeditions to the North Pole. England at that time was experiencing similar social upheaval in the wake of the postwar depression, even as offi  cial opinion suggested that the family should become the foundation of a renewed social harmony and the patriarchal duty of the male household head was to ensure the public peace of his household. Such thought was unrealistic, and the consequent frustration of offi  cials such as Buchan, who returned in 1819, provoked a political furor that brought naval government to an end.

In 1819, Buchan, along with another surrogate judge, Anglican minister  John  Leigh,  ordered  that  two  Conception  Bay  planters,  Philip Butler and James Lundrigan, each receive thirty-six lashes of the cato'-nine-tails for their contempt of court. Butler's and Lundrigan's debt problems were part of a larger wave of post-1815 insolvencies that peaked in 1820 but lasted until 1825. The matter had arisen from suits for debt by their supplying merchants. Merchants pursued delinquent debtors by asking the court to seize fi  shing people's produce and/or equipment. The surrogate courts did not order corporal punishment for other fi  shermen who treated these writs with contempt (indeed, the surrogate courts had used corporal punishments such as whipping only on a couple of occasions for thefts in the 1780s). The surrogate judges usually jailed a defendant, if he was acting alone, or ordered that person to behave until his debt was paid, and would intercede on the behalf of fi  shers if they thought merchants were jeopardizing their families' ability to avoid starvation. The sentence of whipping was out of character for Buchan and Leigh, who had earlier dealt leniently with fi  shermen charged with contempt in debt cases.

The only difference between Butler and Lundrigan and the other offenders was that their cases involved wives openly defying peaceable patriarchal social order. Butler's and Lundrigan's crime was not contempt  of  court  but  their  failure  to  be  proper  patriarchs,  something which must have troubled Buchan greatly given his experience of the Winter of the Rals. The surrogate judges had expected Butler and Lundrigan, and all other men for that matter, to maintain order

within their households. Such order would be in keeping with the patriarchy of English common law, particularly in inheritance law, which recognized few property or civil rights for women within the family and still allowed men to use corporal punishment to discipline the public lives of women. Offi  cial patriarchy existed in naval government. There was no place for women in the administrative structures of government at Newfoundland; no one, for example, could hope to have their case tried in court before women as judges or juries.

Despite  such  formal  patriarchy,  their  importance  to  the  fi  shery meant that women assumed important public economic and social roles in their communities. By the second decade of the nineteenth century, women took care of most of the shore work of curing fi  sh and oversaw most of their households' supplementary farming. Families which had an excess of female labour often hired out daughters to do shore work for those fi  shing families who lacked a suffi  cient number of women and girls. In Conception Bay, the courts tended to recognize husbands' assumption of the property rights of their wives upon marriage. Nonetheless, the courts recognized the rights of women to inherit property upon the death of male relatives and continued to recognize women who acted as the de facto heads of some fi  shing enterprises and traded with merchants on their own account, whether they acted through male relatives or on their own in court. Likewise, the Placentia courts heard women's complaints but also recognized their right to inherit property on a 'share and share alike' basis with male  relatives.  Their  pivotal  role  in  the  production  and  reproduction of outport society and economy gave women a public life and a prominence which defi  ed the offi  cial, patriarchal proscriptions for behaviour of the period. 35

Women managed the day-to-day activities of their homes and surrounding gardens. This made them most likely the fi  rst to meet a constable on his way to serve a writ of attachment on the fi  shing families' belongings as a result of a merchant's suit. As they might deal with each other in cases of slander, or even disputes over scarce, precious topsoil and manure, women could greet such offi  cers of the court with violence, public ridicule, or gossip - yet other challenges to offi  cial gender proscriptions. In Butler's case, his wife refused to turn over her household's property to answer a writ to satisfy a claim for Â£236 by their merchants, Trimingham and Co. Lundrigan's debt of Â£13 was much less than Butler's, but his wife, Sarah Morgan, threatened to blow out the brains of the constable who tried to serve a writ. While Buchan and Leigh claimed that they ordered Lundrigan whipped be-

use he would not appear in court, their remittance of twenty-two of Lundrigan's lashes only after he promised to make sure his family left their fi  shing room suggests that Morgan's forcible possession of the fi  shing  room had most bothered Buchan and Leigh. Compared with their wives, James Lundrigan and Philip Butler played a small but unforgivable part in the actual contempt of court. They had stood aside and let their wives openly defy the courts in defence of their households. The surrogates' singling out the males for punishment refl  ected  the  English  judicial  system's  preference  for  believing  that women's femininity rendered them incapable of responsibility for serious breaches of public order and the local courts' refusal to allow married women to take part in legal actions independent of their husbands. Whatever the reason, the surrogate courts were not prepared to recognize women's unfeminine and public defi  ance of their authority by prosecuting them alongside their husbands. 36

Reformers such as William Carson portrayed the incidents more as examples of the supposedly brutal and arbitrary authority exercised over civilians by naval authorities. They appropriated the whippings as a convenient outrage, which only constitutional change might remedy. Reformers helped the two planters to bring countersuits against Buchan and Leigh for damages in the Supreme Court in November 1820. While Chief Justice Forbes ruled that the surrogates did have the right to punish Butler and Lundrigan, he expressed disapproval of the harsh sentences meted out by the surrogates in these instances. The suits became political show trials, embarrassing the surrogates for their use of excessive authority. Reverend Leigh even apologized and  promised  restitution  in  the  Lundrigan  case.  Neither  surrogate ever added to the controversy by openly discussing their reasons for the whippings. Debates took place in the British House of Commons which  confi  rmed  the  Newfoundland  Supreme  Court's  ruling  that whipping was by then considered an excessive punishment for contempt. 37 The Butler and Lundrigan affair had effectively undermined the legitimacy of naval government in Newfoundland.

Improving relations between settlers and the Beothuks was another area that proved beyond the competency of the naval government. In 1819, the furriers John Peyton, Jr and Sr, decided to kidnap and train a Beothuk as an interpreter for the governor. They retraced Buchan's ill-fated  expedition,  captured  a  woman,  Demasduit,  but  killed  her husband,  Nonosabasut,  in  the  process.  After  being  kept  captive  in Twillingate for a while, Mary March, as her captors named her, was brought to St John's. Her brief time in the capital was pivotal in chang-

ing Newfoundlanders' views of the Beothuks, for while they had once feared dangerous wild people, the woman before them was obviously not. Demasduit sat for her portrait to be painted by Henrietta Hamilton, the governor's wife. Many members of the small elite in St John's now suspected that the fi  shermen were more savage than the Natives. The governor sent Buchan to return her to her people, but she died of tuberculosis before making it home. Given the history of misunderstanding and distrust between the two peoples it was not surprising that no good came of this incident.

By 1823 there were too few Beothuks left to sustain their communities, encouraging three hungry and sick Beothuk women to surrender to some fi  shermen rather than face starvation. John Peyton cared for the three at Twillingate before sending them to St John's, where, like  Demasduit  before,  they  made  a  sensation.  Buchan,  chastened by his earlier experiences, had them returned to a tilt in the woods near Twillingate, where Peyton could keep an eye upon them. Two soon died of tuberculosis, leaving only the young Shanawdithit, as far as she knew the last of her people. For the next fi  ve years Peyton employed her in his home as an unpaid maid and sent Governor Hamilton a bill for her upkeep. While she helped raise Peyton's children, a committee of citizens, led by the Newfoundland-born and Edinburgh-educated William Cormack, formed the Boeothick Institute. In addition to the genuine horror the members felt at reports of atrocities, the Institute exemplifi  ed the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie's interest in using natural history and science as ways of taming the wilderness and bringing it within the knowledge and control of civilization. The Boeothick Institute was dedicated to rescuing any remaining Beothuks and learning what could be recovered about their history. Cormack undertook a couple of unsuccessful expeditions in search of Beothuks, including an epic walk across the breadth of the island with his Innu guide James John of Gander Bay and subsequent expeditions accompanied by Mi'kmaq guides. The Institute concluded that Shanawdithit was likely the only living Beothuk, prompting Cormack to arrange for her to be taken from Peyton's house and brought to St John's. Under Carson's medical care and Cormack's guardianship she was interviewed for information about her people. On 6 June 1829 Shanawdithit died of tuberculosis. Her passing prompted much remorse among subsequent generations for the role that Newfoundlanders had in contributing to the extinction of the Beothuks. Not surprisingly  given  the  imperialistic  science  of  the  day,  Shanawdithit's

skull was removed and sent for study to the Edinburgh museum at which Cormack's mentor worked. 38

The public controversy surrounding the naval government's failure to protect the Beothuks, along with the Butler and Lundrigan affair, discredited  naval  government.  The  Butler  and  Lundrigan  episodes undermined  the  legitimacy  of  the  naval  government's  administration  of  justice,  especially  considering  that  Buchan  was  the  island's chief surrogate. While Governor Hamilton thought that the summary justice of the surrogate courts should be strengthened, he faced stiff opposition from Chief Justice Francis Forbes. Forbes appreciated the cheap and relatively summary justice of Newfoundland but insisted that Newfoundland law must live up to English legal tradition. He argued that Newfoundlanders were British colonists who had rights to the rule of English law, which were daily being trampled by surrogates who, as career naval offi  cers, surgeons, ministers, or merchants' clerks,  had  no  legal  training.  Forbes  further  argued  that  the  courts must be more sympathetic to masters than servants in the fi  shery and wanted servants hired on shares to be recognized as co-adventurers who would have no privileged lien for wages under the wage and lien system. More paternalistic surrogates ignored Forbes's rulings on this matter, and the chief justice was determined to end their infl  uence. 39

Colonial  Offi  ce  offi  cials  were  increasingly  sympathetic  to  Forbes as they realized that the civil requirements of Newfoundland were likely to become much more expensive and beyond the ability of the naval state to provide. The political furor that developed around the Butler and Lundrigan atrocities encouraged this view. The Irish-born merchant Patrick Morris had joined Carson and other Reformers in an 1820 committee of St John's inhabitants. The committee petitioned Governor Hamilton, complaining of arbitrary judicial authority, the injustice  of  taxation  without  representation,  and  the  lack  of  a  local legislature. Debate about the petition in parliament led to more Reform pressure throughout 1822 and 1823. The Reformers hoped that popular outrage at the Lundrigan and Butler affairs, as well as offi  cial displeasure with the legal inadequacies of the untrained surrogates, would encourage the home government to grant Newfoundland selfgovernment by legislature. The British decided to grant minimal colonial government, but with judicial authorities still possessing a great deal of executive power. The British government merged executive and judicial authority by the 1824 reform of the Supreme Court and the appointment of a council along the lines of a system developed

for New South Wales to advise the governor in ruling the colony. The Reform efforts resulted in a new Judicature Act in 1824 (5 Geo.V, c. 47), which replaced that originating in 1791. The British government recognized that Newfoundland was in fact a settled colony, replaced the surrogates with circuit courts presided over by magistrates under the authority of civilian judges of the Supreme Court, and appointed a civilian governor with the power to alienate crown land for agricultural purposes.

The new Judicature Act ended the authority of the surrogates in judicial matters and established a permanent Supreme Court with full civil and criminal jurisdiction over the colony and fi  shery. This new Supreme Court was to have a chief justice presiding over a Central District from its seat in St John's, while assistant judges would preside in circuit courts over southern and northern districts. The appellant Supreme Court for these district courts sat at St John's and served also as the Court of Oyer and Terminer as well as of General Gaol Delivery, and as a Court of Record. Besides having a civil jurisdiction, the Supreme Court gained authority over all crimes on the seas and islands of the Newfoundland fi  shery, as well as over suits on trade and commerce, leaving the Vice Admiralty Court with power over only naval matters. English legal practice would govern all civil and criminal cases, the latter being heard either before a jury at St John's or by circuit judges in the outports with either juries or, if they could not be raised, three assessors. If juries could not be raised for civil cases, the judge could act alone. The chief justice and his assistants now had to be barristers of three years' standing either in Great Britain or the colonies. 40

The merchants of St John's supported the limited reforms of 1824. The depression in the fi  shery that had begun in 1816 had undermined many of the business partnerships between Scottish and West Country fi  rms and interests in St John's. Many of the former junior partners and agents of these British fi  rms set up business in St John's on their own and began to pursue the fi  sh trade, sealing, and local trading. As St John's began to transform into the metropole of the British Newfoundland fi  shery, its merchants became more interested in the issue of colonial government, but within strict limits. Merchants like Meagher and Macbraire, as absentee landlords, delayed considerably the evolution of municipal institutions which might interfere with their property rights. St John's merchants' jealous guardianship of their town's revenue for St John's, not Newfoundland, improvement, eventually persuaded local merchants that gaining control over

the island through a colonial legislature represented the best political means of satisfying their metropolitan impulse in the Newfoundland trade. For such merchants, more representative colonial institutions were to advance their own interests, not those of the colony as a whole, although of course they saw no distinction. In their hands, a colonial government would really be a St John's government. 41

Newfoundland had once been perceived as a great ship moored near  the  fi  shing  banks  for  the  convenience  of  English  fi  shers.  First the American Revolution, then the wars with France and the United States, made the Newfoundland fi  shery a resident one, complete with a nascent local bourgeoisie. After the Napoleonic wars the needs of this  growing  settled  society  could  not  be  met  by  naval  authorities. The colony gained a civilian administration, but that fell far short of satisfying the aspirations of some among the bourgeoisie of St John's. They soon began a fi  ght for more representative colonial institutions, but in a manner that would lead the colonial government to turn its back on the sea.

## A Colonial State, 1824-1855

The imperial government sent Sir Thomas Cochrane as governor to oversee the fi  rst offi  cial  colonial  government. Arriving in 1825, Cochrane, a naval offi  cer, controlled much of the executive and regulatory  authority  of  what  was  a  civilian  administration.  He  felt  that Newfoundland's narrow economic base and small, dispersed coastal population required institutions of government that would be different from the British North American colonies with a more agrarian base. The new governor set the tone for succeeding administrations, which had to govern a complex and diffi  cult society. Various political movements for reform persisted in opposing the new colonial regime, demanding  instead  representative,  then  responsible,  government. Eventually, a consensus about what the nature of colonial self-government should be emerged in St John's, but it had signifi  cant class and  sectarian  dimensions.  More  important,  the  reform  consensus overlooked the integral role of marine resources, which defi  ned the colony's economy and society, in favour of expectations about colonial development that were ill-fi  tted to local circumstances.

The most developed part of the colonial government was the judiciary. The chief justice and assistant justices of the Supreme Court brought greater civil authority to the outports through the new circuit courts established in 1826. The Supreme Court judges also sat on the governor's Executive Council with the St John's garrison commander. By serving as president of the Council, the chief justice was the chief executive authority of the island during the governor's absence. As a result of the 1824 Judicature Act, the circuit courts and justices of the

peace performed many civic as well as judicial duties, and their courthouses served as local government buildings. Most communities only had one justice of the peace, which led circuit judges to administer district affairs personally, approving (for example) the appropriation of district funds from licensing and fees for courthouse and jail repair, hiring constables, and relieving the needy. Where they were more numerous, justices of the peace served in courts of sessions as a form of government through virtual representation that was common in the British colonies of settlement. 1

The Judicature Act gave the governor the right to institute a Court of Civil Jurisdiction for the coast of Labrador. Prior to 1824, the only effective colonial administration had been that of the Moravian missionaries  at  their  stations  along  the  northern  coast.  To  the  south,  a variety of small traders had been moving northward to Hamilton Inlet and Davis Inlet, although many of these were bought out by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), which established posts at Rigolet and  North  West  River  in  1836.  Traders  and  missionaries  acted  as 'substitute governors,' regulating the people who depended on their posts and representing local interests to colonial and imperial offi  cials as they saw fi  t. However, the civil court for Labrador, presided over by naval captain William Paterson from 1825, heard cases and gathered information for authorities in St John's about Innu and Inuit, the Moravians, visiting Americans and Europeans, the fi  shery, and the fur trade. The court visited communities along the southern Labrador coast by hired vessel. By 1827, the Labrador court had taken on more administrative duties, acquired jurisdiction over minor criminal matters, and functioned much like the circuit courts in Newfoundland. While the court was an effective extension of colonial jurisdiction over coastal Labrador, the government in St John's discontinued it in 1834 because of its high costs, dodging its administrative duty to Labrador, and abandoning it to a variety of informal administrations. Governments in St John's continued to collect customs duties and other revenues from the area, collecting more from the territory than it spent there on services. 2

The intensifi  cation of the Labrador fi  shery meant that more people of European descent settled on the Labrador coast. Some were Newfoundland-born, but many continued to be British servants brought out by the British mercantile fi  rms that operated on the coast. Others were deserters from British naval vessels that patrolled the coast. Over the next few decades personnel from the HBC travelled throughout the interior from its local headquarters at North West River promot-

ing the fur trade among the Innu of the interior. From the Orkney Islands or Quebec, these early employees often settled on the coast themselves so that they could trap and trade on their own account just as the original servants of fi  sh merchants had done on the coasts of Labrador to the south and east.

As fur traders elsewhere in the continental north found, the knowledge of the Innu and Inuit was critical to the success of such settlers' trade and survival. HBC servants who wanted to settle did so by marrying Inuit or Innu women. Northward along the coast, the Moravians continued to expand their missions, making the territory of the Inuit more familiar to Europeans. However, smallpox outbreaks caused the Moravians to withdraw with the Inuit to Hopedale and Nain, making the HBC more dependent on the Innu. The Innu preferred to follow the caribou and were reluctant to concentrate on the fur trade. While the HBC worked at luring the Innu into dependence by supplying them with guns and ammunition for the hunt, the company had to rely more on settlers, or those of their employees who married First Nations women. 3

In  Newfoundland,  more  isolated  outports,  such  as  those  on  the south coast, could not resort to the virtual representation of the Court of Sessions because they did not have enough justices of the peace to sit  together.  Cochrane found it diffi  cult to imagine how the colony could develop further without the basis for commercial agriculture and an independent gentry. Wartime prosperity had encouraged rapid population development, but immigration collapsed in the post1815 economic depression. The torrent of post-1815 immigration to the rest of North America bypassed a colony with meagre agricultural potential where the resources of the sea supported almost everyone. Yet fi  sh prices remained so low that merchants were tight-fi  sted with credit, and government faced persistent demands for relief. Although he had little faith in its success, Cochrane encouraged agricultural development, seeking to lessen residents' dependence on the fi  shery. While fi  shing families had always raised root crops and livestock for their own use, Cochrane hoped that commercial agriculture might diversify the economy, balance class divisions through the development of an independent farming population, and provide a landed gentry whose existence might deserve a legislature. The governor planned to use able-bodied relief through road building to open up agricultural land to settlement but found that Newfoundland's ecology supported little besides root crops, especially potatoes, and the keeping of a small number of livestock for household use. The government continued to

give out relief for road building, but no matter how many roads were cleared, or how much seed was distributed, farming did not thrive beyond the gardens that fi  shing families were able to tend with their own labour, particularly the labour of women. 4

The particular legal complexities that affected the relationships between merchants and fi  shers in the context of poor postwar prices for fish ensured that the courts had plenty of business in the outports. In 1826, the government appointed a small number of clergy and merchants' agents as conservators of the peace, who could take complaints or depositions under oath and handle the paperwork of the judicial system but  were  unable  to  try  cases.  The  legal  complexities  of  the wage and lien system continued to preoccupy the outport judiciary. A planter in the Labrador trade or the seal hunt had to agree to pay his servants wages fi  xed by written contract long before knowing how the season might fare; masters were prohibited from reducing wages to avoid insolvency. Even if planters had successful voyages, the law of current supply limited their freedom to market fi  sh. If planters tried to sell fi  sh to anyone else, their current suppliers of credit might become nervous about losing their preferential liens and go to court to attach the planters' voyages, possibly forcing the latter into insolvency. To avoid this fate, planters had to continue to deal with current suppliers regardless of the prices such merchants charged for supplies or gave for fi  sh. Current suppliers guarded their status as preferred creditors because they envied servants' even stronger claim. Finally, merchants had little reason to offer better prices for fi  sh to planters who were not their regular clients because they were unsecured creditors if a planter's current supplier forced insolvency. In a bad season, the law allowed servants and current suppliers to protect their own investments while squeezing planters, who found that there was little room for their own successful capital accumulation by the employment of wage labour. 5

The wage and lien system aggravated the greater problems of the long post-1815 depression in the fi  sh trade. Everywhere, fi  shers retreated into household production as much as local settlement allowed. Conception Bay and the southern shore of the Avalon Peninsula were the demographically most mature areas with well-established families to supply suffi  cient labour for household fi  sh production. Trinity, Bonavista, Placentia, and St Mary's bays, areas that had been disturbed by confl  icting Anglo-French exploitation, would not reach the demographic point at which families could supply their fi  shing households with enough labour until the 1850s, and the remainder of the island

(held by the French) would not do so until the 1870s. In such places, merchants continued to employ labour directly to produce salt fi  sh and other marine products. Merchants, who operated in the Strait of Belle  Isle,  found  that  many  of  their  servants  preferred  establishing their independence by settling locally, establishing families often by marrying women from Newfoundland who came to work as cooks and shore crews, and trading fi  sh, seals,  and  furs  to  the  Birds  and other West Country and Jersey fi  rms on their own accounts. Subject to truck, such ex-servants nevertheless preferred the relative autonomy of task-oriented work within the household to time-regimented work for a fi  rm. Merchant fi  rms continued to bring out servants and specialized tradespeople but tried to lower their overhead costs by restricting  their  operations  to  trade  alone  while  continuing  to  rely on servants for supplies of fi  sh. Merchants in St John's specialized in trade with small outport traders and withdrew completely from the direct production of salt fi  sh. 6

It  was the seal hunt rather than agriculture that made settlement possible. In the fi  rst half of the nineteenth century, the hunt on the northeast coast shifted from a shore-based to an offshore operation. Building and supplying schooners for the offshore hunt required capital resources beyond the ability of planters and smaller outport merchants to supply; they turned to the larger merchant fi  rms of Harbour Grace, Carbonear, and St John's for credit. St John's fi  rms had the most resources, and they slowly consolidated their control over the industry by processing the seals brought by vessels from the many smaller outports of the northeast coast that did not deal with Harbour Grace and Carbonear fi  rms.  The seal hunt continued to be vital to the eco7 nomic survival of the outports, but the gulf between fi  shers, masters, and merchants, and the gap between the outports and St John's, became even wider as the benefi  ts of the hunt concentrated in the hands of the colony's largest merchant fi  rms.

The economy of St John's was more diverse. While the post-1815 depression had hurt British merchants' trade in the town, many of the clerks and agents they had sent out found their own local business opportunities. One such clerk was Charles Fox Bennett, who had come to St John's in 1808. Bennett established his own trading fi  rm in partnership with his brother Thomas in the 1820s. While the Bennetts traded fi  sh for European imports, they did not invest in the seal hunt or in ships. Instead, the Bennetts opted for brewing, distilling, and saw milling, industries that took advantage of the port's growing local consumer demand. The growth of the judiciary and executive,

as  well  as  the  continued  presence  of  the  military,  meant  that  there were many government employees and functionaries ready to spend their cash salaries on the goods and services their comfortable lifestyles demanded. Military offi  cers and Supreme Court judges alike had to have suitable homes and domestic servants. They required locally prepared foodstuffs and the services of artisans to fi  x their silver watches and mend their fi  ne boots. The port's elite required teachers for their children, surgeons to nurse them, lawyers to write their wills and fi  ght their legal battles, and ministers and priests to assuage their guilt and assure them of their righteousness. Although tailors, bakers, carpenters,  butchers,  and  shoemakers  had  also  suffered  insolvency and bankruptcy in the wake of 1815, their trades survived, as did the urban professions of a growing middle class. 8

People who worked in the fi  shery continued to be the largest proportion of the St John's population. A few immigrants continued to arrive  throughout the 1820s. These tended to be the poorest of the Irish who could only afford passage on the ships that supplied the fish trade, not passage to more attractive destinations in the Canadas or the United States. Many of these probably hoped to continue on their way to other parts of North America but often abandoned their passage when their vessel called at St John's. Such was the case of the thirty-two passengers of the brig James in  1827.  Typhus aboard ship forced them off in St John's, where they sought the help of the Irish-born Roman Catholic Bishop Michael Fleming as they tried to find  work.  More  ill  passengers  left  the  overcrowded Freedom ,  having travelled from Waterford without suffi  cient supplies, sleeping on top of its cargo of salt for the fi  shery during the voyage. Many of the passengers had dysentery, but this did not stop the labouring people of the port from taking them into their homes. The illnesses quickly spread throughout the town and into nearby Quidi Vidi and Logy Bay. District surgeons investigated the problem and assured authorities that 'respectable' people need not fear; cases of illness 'were generally confi  ned to the hovels of the poor,' and typhus usually affl  icted only those who had poor diets, poor access to clean water, and were usually fatigued, that is, the St John's 'lower classes.' William Carson rightly complained later in the summer that it was shocking that the authorities had taken little action to help the poor. 9

Although they lived in appalling conditions, fi  shing people and immigrants in St John's and its vicinity could fi  nd work as unskilled labourers or tradespeople in the construction of the many government buildings and churches that proceeded through the 1820s. Building

contractors and real estate developers took advantage of the general desperation for employment to pay low wages, prompting the development of unions among construction workers as early as the last years of the eighteenth century. In 1799 and 1800, journeymen carpenters employed in building an Anglican church and in constructing a house for Dr John Macurdy, a St John's landlord, had united to strike for better wages. At that time English law did not allow workers to form combinations to improve their working conditions; the Supreme Court ordered the arrest of these carpenters and declared their unions illegal. When out of work, many carpenters and labourers worked in the fi  shery,  leading colonial offi  cials to have a low opinion of their skills, while skilled artisans left the colony to search for better prospects elsewhere. 10

Many tradespeople plied their skills in areas linked to the fi  shing industry and shipping. Sailmakers, ships' carpenters, and especially coopers  were  important  to  the  local  economy.  Most  goods  carried aboard ships in  the  nineteenth  century  were  packed  in  barrels,  including cod and seal oils, two of the colony's most important exports. It is not surprising, then, that a cooper, Laurence Barron, led skilled artisans from many trades into an alternate form of organization that would not run afoul of the law. Barron formed a Mechanics' Society  in  1827.  In  addition  to  Barron,  the  society's  executive  included a shoemaker, two tailors, a baker, and a bookkeeper. Unable to improve their lot legally by bargaining for better wages, the mechanics used their members' dues to assist each other in times of sickness and death. The Mechanics' Society emphasized the virtue of self-improvement; by 1846 it had established a reading room where its members could fi  nd books, newspapers, and other journals, as well as meet to discuss and debate the issues of the day. 11

Although  commercial  agriculture  was  very  limited,  the  demand created by St John's farming meant that money might be made even in selling small quantities of high-priced fresh produce, dairy products, eggs, and meat. Irish immigrants to the city, many of whom had trades or had experience as farm labour were not content to live simply  as  labourers  or  fi  shers;  the  Irish  constituted  a  disproportionate number of those who tried to take up farming in the outlying parts of the town. In the area near St John's, some successful commercial farms supplied some fresh meat, milk, poultry, eggs, and vegetables to the town. Farming remained limited even close to the market of the capital. Many of the most successful farms were owned by government offi  cials, military offi  cers, and merchants who had the money to

improve the small amounts of good land that could be found at the edges of St John's. Their farms never came close to being able to supply the demand for food in the town let alone the colony. From the first  decade of the nineteenth century, much of the livestock raised by local farmers had actually been imported from Prince Edward Island or the neighbouring British North American colonies by butchers and merchants to be fattened, milked, and fi  nally slaughtered. The residents of St John's consumed pork products, butter, oats, and even potatoes imported from the same neighbours, even drawing on the supplies of Cape Breton and eastern Nova Scotia, which, although not well endowed agriculturally, had much better resources than most of Newfoundland. 12

Without a vibrant local agricultural economy, few fi  shing people could fi  nd  local  substitutes  for  merchant  imports  and  continued to remain dependent on merchant credit. Ambitious local political reformers used the potential discontent of a people suffering through tight credit for their own ends. Rather than build a political movement based on confronting the fundamental problem of the competing needs of producers and merchants in fi  sheries that had proved to be Newfoundland's only good resource base, reformers misdirected popular frustration against merchants' supposed opposition to economic  diversifi  cation  through  agricultural  development  and  merchants' alleged wish to undermine fi  shers' rights in the wage and lien system. Reformers claimed merchants could do this because of their inordinate infl  uence over a colonial government that did not represent the people of the colony. 13

Governor Cochrane found that it was expensive to support agricultural development, build roads, relieve the poor, and fund the judiciary. As early as 1825 the governor had been exploring some form of municipal government for St John's and in 1828 proposed an ad valorem duty to raise the revenue required by the expense of government. St John's merchants objected to the new tax on imports, which would have to be passed on to fi  shing families. Such families would likely demand a higher price for their fi  sh or they would starve. Merchants feared that such higher prices would make them less competitive in European markets. The local press also complained about the appearance of taxation without representation. The governor's proposal, and subsequent debate in the press, fuelled the reform movement. The Reformers, led by William Carson and Patrick Morris, revived the antinaval rhetoric of their indignation over the whippings of Butler and Lundrigan. A number of St John's merchants, including the leaders of

its Chamber of Commerce, began to support the Reformers' demands for  representative  institutions. 14 Merchants  such  as  Thomas  Brooking, William Thomas, and Newman Hoyles supported the demand because they objected to having their property taxed without representative institutions. Reformers such as Carson and Morris worried as much about gaining control over access to government patronage. Carson, the surgeon and aspiring gentryman, and Morris, the petty trader, were part of a new St John's bourgeoisie of small merchants, doctors, lawyers, and other urban professionals who had done well by the wars but had never acquired the status in colonial administrators' eyes of the agents and merchants of the British fi  rms and those with military connections. In the absence of local political government over which they could exercise some control, the Reformers found that they had no way to force government to reward them with the perks of political offi  ce to which they felt entitled.

Most of the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador cared little about the desires of an elite few in St John's and larger towns such as Harbour Grace and Carbonear. The political patronage of Reformers would not improve fi  sh prices, make credit more readily available, or feed their families. There were plenty of local grievances the Reformers  could  use  to  build  popular  support.  The  Butler  and  Lundrigan affair was one; another was the need to secure local control over the funds generated by the leasing of property in St John's. The Reformers needed something more, however, if they were to really fi  re public support and gain the cooperation of the British Colonial Offi  ce and the  imperial  government,  which  alone  could  grant  representative government. 15

The Reformers found a perfect cause in the ongoing problem of public relief. Carson argued that there would be no relief problem in Newfoundland if the government only managed its economic policy better. He repeated constantly that agriculture was undeveloped because of mercantile infl  uence on an oligarchic colonial administration, not because of the ecological conditions of the colony. Only a government elected in the colony, Carson argued, would govern in the local  interest  by  developing  systematic  agricultural  colonization  of the interior, partially by a road-building scheme. Carson and Morris's rhetoric began to appeal to the Colonial Offi  ce. The British government paid for public relief, argued the Reformers, but a colonial legislature might bear this burden. A representative government would finally develop properly the colony's resources, and poverty would disappear. In making this argument, the Reformers were taking ad-

vantage of the growing popularity of imperial reformers who wanted to lessen the imperial government's fi  nancial commitments by granting self-government to the colonies, including the responsibility for local taxation and expenditure. The Newfoundland Reformers were also  echoing  the  opinions  of  reformers  in  the  neighbouring  British North American colonies that colonial governments were better able to manage local development than offi  cials appointed by the imperial government. 16

Governor  Cochrane  supported  imperial  reform  and  had  hoped that his agricultural development policies would prepare the way for representative government. In 1831, Cochrane's government allowed leases at the low rate of nine pence per acre on land in the vicinity of St John's. By doing so, Cochrane was asking the Reformers to put their money where their mouths were. If a trader such as Morris was really serious about Newfoundland's agricultural potential, let him lease an estate, hire labourers and rent to tenants, farm the land profi  tably, and contribute to the maintenance of the colony through the small amount of rent the government asked for. The Reformers would not take Cochrane's challenge; instead they complained that they could not earn enough from their farms to pay even the pittance of nine pence per acre. Cochrane took the Reformers' whining as evidence that Newfoundland would never have a landed gentry, and in his view without a gentry, there was little social basis for the establishment of a legislature. The governor felt that he must encourage agriculture but that there was no reason to establish representative government any time soon. Carson and Morris felt that Cochrane's opposition to representative government was narrow-minded; the governor could not contemplate allowing Newfoundland colonists, such as themselves, to take their proper place in the empire. No matter how diffi  cult the problems to be overcome, it was the right of every British subject, at least if they were white, to make the attempt themselves. 17

Some  Reformers  had  tried  to  formulate  a  colonial  development strategy with fi  sheries as its centrepiece. An 1824 investigation by the Colonial Offi  ce into the economic state of Newfoundland heard local complaints about the manner in which the Americans and French used subsidies, called bounties, to encourage the recovery and growth of the fi  sheries on the Grand Banks. Patrick Morris suggested that similar imperial assistance to the Newfoundland fi  shing industry would help relieve economic distress. Anxious to minimize colonial expenditures and conscious of the declining importance of the fi  shery in an empire now dominated by Britain as the 'workshop of the world,'

British offi  cials would not agree to bounties for the fi  shery. Reformers found even more frustrating the British government's refusal to give Newfoundland fi  shing vessels concurrent fi  shing rights to those of the French on the French Shore. The imperial government would not offend such an important trading partner as France for the sake of one small colony. The imperial government's position made Morris even more determined to support representative government and entrenched his support for local agricultural development. An elected colonial government, he thought, would be more amenable to the need to assist local industries. Without British subsidies fi  shers would have to accept lower fi  sh prices to compete with the French and American products, and the only way that Newfoundlanders could make up the lost income would be by expanding supplementary farming. 18

The misery of the fi  shery had begun to tell on the side of the Reformers. The winter of 1831-2 had been unusually severe and long, forcing the government again to issue seed potatoes to avert famine. In Conception Bay, crowds looted merchant stores for bread and other foodstuffs. Local men hoped that the spring seal hunt would provide some money, but local merchants hoped to make up for the recent string of poor fi  sheries from the hunt as well. These merchants gave credit to the planters who captained the sealing schooners. These planters, in turn, advanced sealers berths on their ships and credit against their future wages, determined by a share of the total catch, at the end of the hunt. Sealers were not paid for their work in cash but kept accounts with their planters' merchants for needed equipment, which they acquired on credit. Such accounts were open to truck practices by merchants and planters. Truck had been a mutual, though unequal, paternalistic accommodation between sealers, merchants, and planter-dealers. Fishers constantly required credit to purchase equipment, provisions, and other supplies, and to hire occasional labour for their household enterprises, but faced frequent, cyclical depressions in the industry due to wars and variations in market demand and supply. Merchants extended credit to allow fi  shing people to survive the disruptions of the market and continue to supply fi  sh for their international trade. In return, merchants manipulated prices of goods they sold residents to offset losses in the fi  sh trade. Simply put, fi  sh producers and merchants needed each other. Fishing people might use truck to preserve their households' independence from direct service to another master, especially as merchants provided winter supplies, but it was hard to escape debt. 19

Persistent poor conditions in the fi  shery meant that merchants in

the  Newfoundland  trade  constantly  risked  overextending  credit  to fishing families for which they could only take fi  sh in payment even if  the market for fi  sh proved poor. This was particularly a problem for West Country and Jersey houses that might be investing in other areas of the transatlantic trade, that were far removed from the dayto-day administration of the fi  shery in Newfoundland, and that did not have alternate local sources of revenue, such as renting premises, that kept the more modest merchant houses of St John's afl  oat during bad years. Such was the case for the Bristol and Harbour Grace fi  rm of H.W. Danson, which ended in bankruptcy in 1831. Danson's business failed in May before he had settled accounts with the sealers who had worked for him or his dealers that spring. The sealers had to forcibly seize casks of seal oil to compel the trustees of Danson's estate to pay their wages but learned in the process that truck could not guarantee that merchants would survive economic vicissitudes and hence that credit with an insolvent merchant did not count for much.

The next year, the sealers determined to get rid of truck. They met at  Saddle  Hill,  which  they  renamed  'Liberty  Hill,'  in  January,  and agreed only to go sealing for masters who paid in cash. While Carbonear merchants quickly came to terms with the sealers, the Harbour Grace fi  rm of Thomas Ridley did not. As a result, some of the sealers attacked a ship belonging to the fi  rm. The authorities tried to intervene, but the sealers, led by people from Carbonear, continued to use violence to intimidate planters and merchants who would not meet their demands. Merchants yielded in March, and the seal hunt began. 20

The sealers had been well organized and united, demonstrating to the colonial administration that fi  shing people, when organized collectively, constituted a powerful political force. Reformers began to pitch  for  representative  government  as  a  pro-fi  sherman  program, promising it would break the merchants' hold on government. A colonial legislature would manage the full development of colonial resources to guarantee prosperity. Thomas Ridley, joined by Carbonear merchant Robert Pack, doubtless trying to improve his image among the angry sealers, jumped on the reform bandwagon. Under increased pressure from the Reformers, and with the dominant British liberal sentiment in the House of Commons favouring colonial representative institutions, the Colonial Offi  ce instructed Cochrane in 1832 to create a legislature. This legislature was bicameral, consisting of an elected lower house and an appointed council of seven with legislative and executive powers. The governor retained the right to adjourn,

prorogue, and dissolve the legislature and did not have to be guided by the wishes of the House of Assembly. 21

Newfoundland had the broadest franchise of the empire, universal manhood suffrage, but the governor was not responsible to an elected assembly. The House of Assembly largely controlled the manner in which government could raise revenue, but it did not control spending, especially the hiring or the payment of salaries, particularly those of the executive councillors. Gradually becoming known as Liberals, the Reformers continued to fi  ght for Assembly control over spending.

Many of the smaller merchants and professionals of the old reform movement  such  as  Morris  were  Irish  Roman  Catholics.  They  also wanted constitutional change to ensure that members of their denomination  received  a  fair  share  of  government  patronage.  Opposition coalesced around mercantile and Protestant hostility in a loose political group known as the Conservatives. Cochrane preferred to appoint Anglicans from the mercantile elite  of  St  John's  to  most  important government positions, believing they were the most respectable people available. The Conservatives defended their hold on government patronage,  but  they  also  fought  against  Liberal  attempts  to  secure additional revenue for colonial development through taxation of the fishery. 22

The governor knew that British fi  nancial support for the government of Newfoundland was about to end. The Assembly would have to fi  nd a way to pay for the expansion of government services in areas such as administration of justice, fi  sheries regulations, and public relief, but the governor wished to retain his authority over appointing most government offi  cials. The colonial government, through the legislature, was now responsible for paying for the Supreme Court, a costly burden that included paying for a clerk and sheriff for each of the circuit courts. The cost of the judiciary was high, but even then the imperial government retained most of the authority and means of enforcement for fi  sheries law, which mattered most to the colonial economy. In 1834, the legislature had failed to convince the British government to  enforce  treaty  restrictions  on  French  and  American vessels involved in smuggling. The colonial government enacted fi  sheries regulations in 1836 that penalized the Americans and French for fishing for bait or cutting timber for the fi  shery outside treaty areas and punished any Newfoundlander for trading bait or timber with them. The British government disallowed the law, arguing that only it had the right to make laws within the empire that might affect treaties with foreign powers. 23

Patrick Morris led the Assembly in this unsuccessful engagement with British authorities. He fought on, but amid less important, if more venal and sensational, patronage issues. Other Irish Roman Catholic Reformers, particularly Morris's nephew John Kent, played the sectarian card in the attempt to secure the benefi  ts of offi  ce. A member of St John's aspiring shopkeeper bourgeoisie, Kent had become a successful auctioneer and commission agent in the early 1830s. Ambitious, Kent courted  Johanna  Fleming,  the  sister  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Bishop Michael Fleming, and embarked on a political career during the election of the fi  rst House of Assembly in 1832. Kent's attack on the Executive Council's control of patronage while seeking a nomination for a seat in St John's earned the enmity of Henry Winton, the Conservative editor of the Public Ledger , a St John's newspaper. Kent responded by suggesting that Winton's politics were nothing more than bigoted opposition to Roman Catholics' sharing political power. Winton, in turn, demanded that the bishop declare his political neutrality.

Bishop Fleming would not stand for Winton's suggestion that he had no right to a public political opinion and openly voiced his support for Kent, William Carson, and the Protestant merchant William Thomas, who appeared to sympathize with the Reformers. The bishop openly led a campaign for the Reformers. As a result, Kent and Thomas won their seats, but Carson's own squabbles with Edward Wix, the  Anglican  archdeacon,  cost  him  victory.  The  long-term  political signifi  cance of the election was that 'the cross of Christ was dragged into St John's politics.' 24 Important matters were to come before the electorate of Newfoundland and Labrador, but within the blood sport of narrow sectarianism.

Reformers such as Carson found that the support of the  Roman Catholic bishop was indispensable to their election and fi  ght for control over patronage. Carson won a by-election to the Assembly in 1833 with Fleming's support and sectarian rioting on his behalf. Bishop Fleming  used  Reform  support  to  help  bully  opposition  within  his church, such as that from the liberal Irish Roman Catholic merchant Timothy Hogan, or the carpenter Patrick Kough, who opposed the autocratic Fleming. Hogan and Kough were from Wexford, tried to get along with the government, and supported the non-sectarian Benevolent Irish Society (formed in 1806) and its non-denominational Orphan Asylum School (formed in 1827). Hogan opposed Fleming's efforts to exert episcopal control over church fi  nances, establish denominational education within the Asylum School, and enmesh the St John's church in supporting the liberal nationalism of the followers

of the Irish Reformer Daniel O'Connell, who began to advocate for the repeal of the union between Ireland and Britain. While Fleming justifi  ed his policies as an effort to unite the local church under papal control, the bishop campaigned for control over government patronage by a newer Waterford bourgeoisie, composed of people such as Morris, John Kent, and Laurence O'Brien. By promoting Munster interests along with his lieutenant Father Edward Troy, Fleming promoted sectarian  strife  with  the  older  Leinster  interests  and  further associated moderate local reform without representative government with subservience to British colonialism.

Governor Cochrane thought Fleming was an opportunistic demagogue who would commit almost any outrage to mobilize 'the lower orders' to fi  ght for his political candidates. Fleming, deeply conservative, may ironically have seen himself as an Irish Reformer in the tradition of O'Connell, fi  ghting to liberate Roman Catholic settlers from a colonial state that denied their clerics the right to perform marriages, had insisted on public oaths for offi  ce that Catholics could not take, refused public support for their schools, and discriminated against Roman Catholics in appointments to leading political offi  ces such as the Executive Council. 25

The Irish were not homogeneous; a huge gulf separated the Irish members of the St John's bourgeoisie and the vast majority of the Irish who worked in the town and in the fi  shery generally. Fleming may have  been  an  O'Connellite,  but  the  movement  had  a  specifi  c  class agenda. In Ireland, O'Connellite priests had fought for the rights of the local Catholic bourgeoisie against the Protestant Ascendancy by defl  ecting  the  discontent  of  their  fellow  Roman  Catholic  labourers and tenants against Protestantism. In Newfoundland, Irish Catholic employers treated their employees no better than did Protestant ones, but priests channelled the discontent of the poor away from the economic circumstances that produced their poverty and toward offi  cial Protestantism and British rule. Fleming and his supporters used sectarianism to convince the 'lower orders,' as someone like Kent might have termed fi  shers and workers, that their interests were the same. Signifi  cantly, the Liberal-priest alliance did not rely on grounds other than that they were all Irish Roman Catholics together. They relied on the old Reform attacks on the supposed neglect of local colonial development by governors who promoted only the narrow interests of fi  sh merchants. The dominance of Anglicans on the Executive Council, in turn, reinforced the association of mercantile privileges with those of the  established  church.  The  Liberal  alliance  with  Fleming  could  be

portrayed at once as a just, if sectarian, battle against the monopoly of privilege and as a fi  ght for fi  shermen's rights. 26

Simmering discontent about the wage and lien system provided the Liberals  with  strong  ammunition.  A  new  Fisheries  Act,  which  had accompanied the Judicature Act of 1824, recognized and expanded upon fi  shing servants' wage liens and continued to recognize the liens of current suppliers. The Colonial Offi  ce wanted the new colonial government to amend the law as seemed appropriate. In 1829, Cochrane had asked magistrates throughout the colony to convene public meetings of planters and merchants to review the wage and lien system. Few people suggested at these meetings that the system was as much a problem as was the overall depressed condition of the fi  sh trade. Planters and merchants did complain that the law gave servants too many privileges and felt that employers in the trade should be able to renegotiate wages if fi  sh prices proved lower than expected, or if catches were bad due to bad weather or environmental perturbations that may have disrupted fi  sh populations in local areas. Merchants further felt that their liens for current supply should be given priority over those of servants for wages. The Supreme Court under Chief Justice R.A. Tucker, supported by Attorney General James Simms, agreed, but recommended that the entire wage and lien system be abolished, including current supply. The Liberals had fought with Tucker (who resigned in the course of the dispute), in his role as president of the Executive Council, over money bills in 1833. In his place, the Colonial Offi  ce appointed the Upper Canadian Henry John Boulton, fresh from disgrace and accusations of corruption as attorney general of Upper Canada. A Conservative, Boulton detested the Upper Canadian reformer William Lyon Mackenzie.

As president of the Executive Council, Boulton had no intention of making any concessions to the Liberals in the House of Assembly. At the same time, as chief justice of the Supreme Court, Boulton was determined to follow Tucker in seeing the wage and lien system ended. The chief justice felt that the wage and lien system contradicted English civil law. Usually, he argued, the fi  rst creditor, not the last (as in the case of current suppliers in the fi  shery), had the most secure lien against an insolvent's estate. In a series of court cases in 1835, Boulton ruled that merchants were not liable to pay all of an insolvent planter's servants' wages if the planter had not caught enough fi  sh to pay them, and they had no liability for contracts between masters and servants if they were not parties in the agreement. As president of the Executive Council, Boulton declared that it would never assent

to  another  law  re-establishing  the  system.  At  a  time  when  colonial politicians had begun seriously debating the proper management of the colony's critical marine resources, public debate degenerated into much sound and fury about laws that had, at best, merely aggravated the dominant trend in the fi  shery for planters to retreat from the hiring of servants in the fi  rst place. 27

Boulton's further reforms in jury selection, the incorporation of a law society, and the regulation of barristers and attorneys all provided further ammunition for Liberal attacks on the supposed arbitrariness of his role as both chief justice and Council president. There were fears among many in St John's that Boulton's changes in the selection process for juries would make it easier for lawyers to challenge the appointment of Irish jurors. The issue was important because most of the people imprisoned by trial were Irish. Bishop Fleming had taken action in a number of cases where miscarriages of justice either were in process or had already taken place. In one case, Fleming prevented the execution of a wrongfully convicted Roman Catholic from the Labrador coast named Hackett. In another case, the bishop catalogued a long series of incorrect procedures in court that led to the execution of a Harbour Grace labourer, Peter Downey. Finally, Fleming's assistant Father Troy, convinced of her innocence, had tried unsuccessfully to save Catherine Snow from hanging for the murder of her husband, Conception Bay planter John Snow. Fleming, Troy, and the Liberal press  labelled  Boulton  'a  bigot  and  partisan,'  and  popular  outrage greeted the fate of Downey and Snow. In both cases the public injury of apparent miscarriages of justice was exacerbated by the insult and indignity of the public display of the executed bodies. At Harbour Grace, anonymous threats against a local magistrate led to the quick burial of Downey. In Port de Grave, the local priest led a crowd to seize the body from the district surgeon for a public burial. 28

The Liberals capitalized on the outrage when Patrick Morris sponsored a bill in the Assembly that would have supposedly aided Roman Catholic-dominated fi  shing servants to secure payment of their wages. Boulton used his position as Council president to throw out the bill, claiming he was simply continuing legal changes instigated by his predecessors in the general application of English law to Newfoundland.  Fleming  accused  Boulton  of  undercutting  the  rights  of poor fi  shing servants in the interest of the colony's fi  sh merchants. Carson, Morris, Kent, and John Valentine Nugent led a mass, openair  meeting of protest against the chief justice early in the summer of 1835. This meeting produced a petition to the British government

accusing Boulton of a 'rancorous hostility to the interests of the poor.' Throughout 1835, Robert Parsons, editor of the Patriot , a Liberal newspaper, repeated one message on Boulton's decisions about the wage and lien system: ' Boulton's law [has] made us a pauper population ... and put the just dues of the Fisherman and the Shoreman into the pockets of the Merchant!' 29

Boulton,  whose  wife  Eliza  was  a  Roman  Catholic  and  who  got on well with the Scottish clerics who dominated the church in Upper Canada, was unprepared for Fleming's hostility. When Boulton charged  Parsons  with  contempt,  the  new  governor,  Prescott,  had the garrison prepare to take to the streets to keep the peace. Fleming ruthlessly attacked any who sided with Boulton. The editorials of the bishop's nemesis, Henry Winton, earned him such popular enmity that a crowd accosted him, mutilating his ears, on a trip between Carbonear and Harbour Grace. Most were certain that Winton suffered at the hands of the Roman Catholic fi  shing people he had fi  rst criticized during the sealers' protests of 1830-2 and continued to offend by his criticism of Fleming and defence of Boulton. Robert Parsons's editorial pen always insinuated that Boulton was the puppet of the colony's fi  sh merchants, and Reformers suggested that the only remedy would be a government more responsible to the people of the colony. Boulton responded that the Liberals cared nothing for fi  shing servants' wage liens but knew a good political rallying cry when they heard it. By 1837, Boulton claimed that he was a bulwark against an unholy political alliance between the Liberals and an insubordinate Roman Catholic Church, which willingly used violence to attain their goals. Boulton successfully defended his decision on the wage and lien  system  before  the  Privy  Council  at  London  in  1838.  However, the  Colonial  Offi  ce  demanded  his  resignation  because  of  Boulton's reputation as a bigot and decided that future chief justices would no longer preside over the Executive Council. 30

The political excesses of sectarianism proved too much for Parsons, who had little interest in seeing a political oligarchy rule Newfoundland from the bishop's palace any more than from the governor's office. Parsons broke with Fleming's faction in 1849, when the bishop opposed  the  candidacy  of  James  Douglas,  a  Liberal  Presbyterian merchant, in a St John's by-election. Parsons supported Douglas and newer Irish Roman Catholic politicians like Ambrose Shea, who saw themselves as true Newfoundland natives, not Irish-born foreigners. The Newfoundland Natives' Society had recently emerged to champion the careers of the native-born over the Irish and English born.

Shea, from a merchant family that had come to Newfoundland in the early 1780s, did not have the same sense of grievance against the British as did the newer bourgeois families of St John's such as the Kents and the Morrises. He welcomed the formation of the Newfoundland Natives' Society, supported it as editor of a local newspaper, the Newfoundlander , and became its president in 1846. The Irish Catholic faction of the Liberals, which dominated the Assembly, cut off Parsons's patronage as the Assembly printer for supporting the natives and led him back to the Liberal fold. Nonetheless, afraid of lower-class radicalism, Parsons would not support Liberals like Morris, who continued to court the political support of fi  shers by unsuccessful efforts to restore the wage and lien system in law. 31

By 1841 sectarian violence forced the British parliament to appoint a Select Committee to review affairs in Newfoundland. The committee interviewed Cochrane, delegates from the Assembly, and various opponents of Fleming, and heard a number of merchants' concerns that Conception Bay sealers continued to press for better pay through collective action. The franchise, these merchants argued, did not belong in the hands of such people. All of the evidence left the British government with no doubt that the social and political fractures of the colony ran deep. Uninterested in resuming responsibility for Newfoundland, the Colonial Offi  ce recommended that electoral infl  uence with the colonial government be lessened by amalgamating the House of Assembly with the appointed Legislative Council. Further, the Colonial Offi  ce recommended a more conciliatory governor for Newfoundland. This governor could use his powers of appointment to ensure that the more cooperative elements within the Liberal movement could be promoted within the amalgamated legislature. 32

The British government appointed a new governor, Sir John Harvey, the fi  rst to have previous experience in colonial administration, who arrived in the fall of 1841. Harvey wanted to mollify the Liberals by friendly overtures to Fleming, appeasing Carson and Morris with a Newfoundland Agricultural Society and patronizing them with appointments to the Executive Council. The prickly Carson passed away in 1843, but Morris became a government supporter. The governor further assuaged Fleming by using the 1843 Education Act to provide public support for Roman Catholic schools, such as those being established by the Sisters of Mercy, an Irish teaching order. Providing public support for denominational education was Harvey's attempt to subordinate the class divisions between fi  shers and merchants and dampen the sectarian fl  ames that had been fanned by Irish Roman

Catholic members of the St John's bourgeoisie. Harvey hoped to instill a unifying sense of British nativism in Newfoundlanders by rallying people from all classes and creeds behind the British fl  ag in a culture of improvement. Government would inspire this culture of improvement by adopting much of the development platform of the old Reformers. 33

The need for economic development drove Harvey's support for the  culture  of  improvement.  Representative  government  had  done nothing to relieve persistent low prices in the fi  shery and merchants' restriction of credit, all aggravated by unusually long, severe winters and poor potato crops. Regular outbursts of store breaking and other forms of collective protest by hungry and starving fi  shing people in the 1830s drove prominent Liberal supporters such as Robert Pack to demand able-bodied relief through road construction beyond the vicinity of St John's. Harvey hoped that the Newfoundland Agricultural Society would foster improved living standards through agricultural diversifi  cation.  Although  he  had  made  agricultural  improvement  a plank in his old Reform platform, Morris, as an executive councillor in the amalgamated assembly, and enjoying Harvey's support, fought unsuccessfully for greater imperial assistance in regulating the fi  sheries and subsidizing the development of a bank fi  shery to compete with the Americans and French. 34

Morris  encouraged  the  colony  to  develop  the  fi  shing  industry without the assistance of the empire. In 1845 the Newfoundland government had established a token bounty of 30 shillings per ton for three  years  to  encourage  colonial  participation  in  the  bank  fi  shery. At the same time, the colonial government passed a law prohibiting the sail of bait to foreigners by Newfoundlanders, despite grumbling in London. Repeatedly, through the early 1850s, Morris led colonial demands for British assistance in the development of the fi  shing industry, including the protection of fi  sh resources from exploitation by other nations, but to little avail. Without British support, especially for the enforcement of regulations at sea, the colonial government had little real effect. The government felt that it had no option but to promote interior economic development through agriculture. The prospects were daunting. Beginning in 1845, disastrous blights plagued the Newfoundland potato crop. Around the island, people could not grow enough potatoes to feed themselves throughout the winter and often resorted to eating their small stocks of seed potatoes. To make matters worse, fi  re swept though St John's during the winter of 18467, followed by disastrous gales around the island. 35

Rather than assist the colony, the Colonial Offi  ce in 1847 revived the bicameral legislature, and Governor Harvey requested a transfer to Nova Scotia. The new governor, Sir Gaspard LeMarchant, was inexperienced as a colonial administrator. Suspicious of Roman Catholicism and a supporter of the establishment of the Church of England as a bulwark of political order and social stability, LeMarchant aggravated sectarianism by supporting the recently appointed Anglican Bishop Edward Feild's Tractarian and High Church ideals. Feild had fought against the evangelical piety popular among Anglican fi  shing people in places such as Harbour Buffett in Placentia Bay. These people  cooperated  with  their  Methodist  neighbours  through  the  Newfoundland School Society and objected to Feild's desire to centralize control over the Anglican Church and to harness their funds to pay for it.

Throughout the nineteenth century, Wesleyan Methodism became more popular because of the accessibility of its itinerant preachers, its enthusiastic revivalism, and its continued emphasis on the common experience of faith. The Church of England opposed Methodism, in the long run failing by 1833 in its bid to have Methodist clergy excluded from the right to solemnize marriages in Newfoundland. From a modest presence in St John's, Conception Bay, and Trinity Bay, the Methodist Church had spread to Bonavista Bay, the Burin Peninsula, and Notre Dame Bay. A district of the British Wesleyan Conference in 1815, the Newfoundland church became part of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference of eastern Canada in 1855 and had been attempting expansion into Labrador. An opponent of public support for Roman Catholic schools, Feild attacked Wesleyan Methodism, despising its 'low' revivalism, and attacked Methodists' rights to denominational education and the solemnization of marriages and baptisms. In doing so,  Feild  alienated  Presbyterians  and  Congregationalists,  whom  he perceived as threats to the loyalty of his church's membership. 36

By supporting Feild, LeMarchant had made his government a target for discontent from dissenting Protestants as well as Roman Catholics. Furthermore, the governor, like the Colonial Offi  ce, felt that merchants should  relieve  the  poor  with  more  credit  and  did  little  to  provide public relief. LeMarchant felt that interior agricultural improvement would succeed if poor Newfoundlanders would desist in their moral failings and laziness, and he actually cut relief in 1848. By 1849 two things were evident: the governor's agricultural policies had failed, and there was a lot of public resentment about his administration's crude misunderstandings about the nature of the relief problem. 37

While much popular anger was aimed at LeMarchant, the social relationships of fi  shing communities meant that it would not be directed  purposefully  against  the  existing  social  order.  Although  the government had passed the Chattels Real Act in 1834, following earlier  Supreme Court decisions in recognizing the right of women to inherit the property of fi  shing households, this did not diminish the overall nature of patriarchy in Newfoundland. The Butler and Lundrigan affair forcefully reminded people in the outports that the legal responsibilities of citizenship were supposed to be a male affair, no matter how much that might be challenged by the importance of women in fi  shing society. Planters could use a variety of patriarchal, non-economic disciplinary measures, often harsh and extralegal, to regulate the labour of women and children in their families for household production. The burden of making salt fi  sh fell on women's and children's shoulders. If planters had to hire labour to make salt fi  sh, they usually paid women lower wages than men, even if both did the same work. The almost life-and-death struggle for many families to earn their livelihoods might pit fi  shers against each other. Instances were reported of women fi  ghting each other over topsoil, and members of neighbouring families sometimes came close to killing each other when their livestock got into each other's vegetable and potato gardens. 38

Patriarchy was a potent form of social relationship that cut across class divisions by defi  ning paternalistic ideology within the colony. Paternalism was particularly important in defi  ning the credit relationships between fi  sh merchants and their clients. Many would doubtless have agreed with a Harbour Grace newspaper correspondent in 1847 who described fi  shermen as being worse off than the 'slaves and serfs of Russia' because of merchants' truck practices. Yet others suggested that truck insulated fi  shing people from the ups and downs of international fi  sh markets. A merchant who provided credit in good years and bad thus acted as 'a father towards his planters.'

Because they did not enjoy the same power as merchants, fi  shers negotiated their relationships with their creditors from below. Merchants controlled prices to increase the likelihood of their profi  t but could not do so with impunity. Fishing people used many practices to negotiate the terms upon which they received credit: some went to court and won decisions against merchants whom they felt had unfairly manipulated accounts; others used extralegal threats and violence by assaulting merchants, taking fi  sh to competitors, or throwing agents or bailiffs into the harbour over disputes about court proceed-

ings  instigated  by  merchants. 39 At  heart,  most  fi  shers  believed  that they had a right to be treated fairly by merchants in order to earn enough to keep their households and families competent. They could be very loyal to a merchant who lived up to their expectations and might defend one threatened by forces from outside their community. Such was the case in 1848, when fi  shers in Brigus, under the cover of darkness, stole the goods seized by the fi  rm of Bowrings in St John's from their local, bankrupt merchant, Richard Leamon. The colonial government, apprehending further trouble, sent troops to the area. Authorities feared that local fi  shing people would become even angrier as the result of the seizure of their local merchant's assets by a St John's merchant. Leamon might have been a usurious merchant, but he was their supplier. 40

Regional differentiation within the colony also tied fi  shing people to their merchants. A merchant from Brigus, Charles Cozens, continued to enjoy popular support among his neighbours despite suffering bankruptcy in 1834, nearly losing his seat in the House of Assembly, and deciding not to run in the next general election. Cozens started over again as a merchant, became a local magistrate and chairperson of the local relief commissioners for Brigus, and demanded better assistance by the government for the poor of his district. In time he became a local political broker whom the government in St John's continued to patronize with political offi  ces. 41

As control over the fi  shery continued to consolidate in St John's, the cleavage between town and outport grew. Outport resentment against St John's was becoming a staple of colonial politics, but the city had its own troubles, particularly for residents who were poor. The tiny 'hovels' of the labouring classes, as the local magistrates liked to refer to them, were inadequate shelters against the cold. Poorly constructed, and warmed and lit by open fl  ames, these homes were constantly at risk of fi  re, and many were destroyed by the fi  re of 1846-7, to be replaced by relief sheds, which continued to house the impoverished for  the  next  fourteen  years.  The  poor  clustered  in  neighbourhoods close to the harbour but could use dogs and sleds to travel outside the town to cut wood for their own use as fuel and to sell to the better-off residents of St John's.

Like most of the pre-industrial cities of North America, St John's had a lot of livestock. In addition to horses used in work and transportation, even the wealthiest homes might have one or two animals to provide meat, eggs, or fresh milk. Suburban farmers and the local authorities complained regularly about the dogs of the poor, suspect-

ing that they harassed or killed livestock, but poor people needed the dogs to help in cutting and selling wood - their only way of supporting themselves in winter, since able-bodied poor relief in road building and other public works stopped with the onset of cold weather. Private charities, usually affi  liated with a church, and often organized and led by bourgeois women, sought to forestall the social discontent and instability that might arise from poverty. One notable effort at poor relief was the St John's factory, begun in 1832 through the fundraising efforts of women and designed to teach women and children how to make cloth and nets. In addition to securing a small grant from the government, and raising money through donations, these women organized balls and theatrical performances whose proceeds went to the factory. 42

By  the  1830s  notices  routinely  appeared  in  colonial  newspapers about failed inshore fi  sheries in the longest-settled areas of Conception, Trinity, and Bonavista bays. Dramatic cyclical declines in Newfoundland salt cod exports, together with steady population increases throughout  the  nineteenth  century,  suggest  that  a  basic  ecological problem resulting from overexploitation of cod stocks underlay the poor catches. The fi  sheries supplied most of the work for Newfoundlanders, and the absolute number of people employed in the fi  sheries rose with overall population. Effort, in other words, rose constantly, but catch rates did not. Evidence continues to mount suggesting that nineteenth-century  fi  shing  people  were  periodically  depleting  discrete bay stocks or substocks of cod in inshore waters. Fishers in Trinity Bay, for example, witnessed signs of local cod stock depletion by the 1830s.

Declining fi  sh catches led some fi  rms, such as that of Slade and Kelson, at Trinity, to contemplate cutting winter credit to clients who failed to catch enough fi  sh to trade against their accounts. Such restriction prompted the fi  rm's manager, William Kelson, to fear violent reaction from fi  shers who might starve without their winter supplies. Kelson sympathized with popular protests among fi  shers against the many new types of fi  shing gear being deployed in waters around the island, particularly cod jiggers (fi  sh-shaped lures attached to hand lines) and trawl lines (lengths of line, often called bultows, with hundreds of baited fi  sh hooks that were anchored and buoyed in the water), and the more intensive use of cod seines (nets used by crews working in two boats to encircle and capture fi  sh). He led protests which argued that these new gears would allow only the better-off few who could afford them to catch more of the increasingly sparse resource, leaving

the mass of fi  shing society to poverty and possible starvation. Kelson's movement failed in 1849 when the Newfoundland government denied the need for conservation, accepted new gears as the prerogative of private capital, and blamed inshore fi  sh scarcities on French and American over-fi  shing offshore. 43

The cyclical recoveries in Newfoundland's total fi  sh exports likely resulted from several factors that may have prevented awareness of  ecological  stress.  While  increased  effort  in  the  Labrador  fi  shery probably masked the inshore failures, fi  shing people also began to build  larger  boats  that  could  travel  to  newer,  outer  headland  fi  shing grounds. Then, as exports recovered in the 1840s, the use of cod seines, trawl lines, and gill nets became more widespread than the older hook-and-line method of fi  shing.

The  careers  of  Kelson  and  Cozens  suggest  that  fi  shers  sympathized with paternalistic merchants as much as they might despise the sectarian-tinged castigations of merchants by the older St John's Liberals.  A  new  generation  of  Liberals  appeared  under  the  leadership of Phillip Francis Little, a Roman Catholic lawyer from Prince Edward Island. Little fought for responsible government but defi  ned it as party government: the governor should be obliged to select the Executive Council, or cabinet, from whichever political party had the support of the most members of the elected House of Assembly. It was time, in Little's mind, for government policy to be inured against the  vagaries  of  governors'  comings  and  goings,  and  for  patronage and policy to be controlled by those who had the support of the electorate. Although older Liberals had continued to use the issue of the wage lien to cultivate popular support, their efforts failed. Appeals to fishing servants further carried the sectarian taint of the Fleming era, and the Liberals under Little wanted to fi  nd a broader, more respectable basis of support. 44

The question of public funding for schools provided an opportunity. The Education Act of 1845 was to expire in 1850. The act provided funding for separate Anglican and Roman Catholic schools, but not for Methodists and other smaller denominations. The Anglican bishop, Edward Feild, vehemently opposed the extension of funding to Methodists and wanted a new act to provide most of the funding for Protestant schools to a separate Church of England board. Feild had the support of Charles Fox Bennett, who had been a Conservative member of the Legislative and Executive Councils and was a determined opponent of responsible government. 45

Little  prevailed  in  building  Methodist  support  for  his  party  and

for responsible government despite sympathy for Feild among some prominent Roman Catholic Liberals such as Ambrose Shea. The Roman Catholic bishop, John Thomas Mullock, openly supported Little's campaign for responsible government. While Mullock supported Irish nationalism and opposed Feild's efforts to entrench the authority of the Anglican Church, he was much more moderate than Fleming, whom Mullock had succeeded in 1850. Mullock also had a reputation as  a  stronger  advocate  of  Newfoundland's  economic  development and as a Newfoundland nativist rather than a local Irish nationalist. Together, Little and Mullock portrayed the Liberal fi  ght as a progressive, pro-development, and non-sectarian movement against the reactionary stance of Field, Bennett, and other opponents of responsible government such as the St John's Commercial Society, the organization that represented St John's merchants. 46

Under Little, the Liberals won a majority in the House of Assembly in the general election of 1852. Throughout the campaign the Liberals cultivated an image of themselves as the friends of Wesleyan Methodism. Although many Methodists remained unconvinced that they would be best represented by a party that had such strong Roman Catholic support, enough supported the Liberals to help that party win.  When  the  new  House  met,  the  Liberals  made  clear  that  they would be satisfi  ed  with  nothing  less  than  responsible  government. While  Newfoundland's  new  governor,  Hamilton,  sided  with  the anti-responsible  government  forces  throughout  1853  and  1854,  the tide had turned. Faced with constant pressure from the House of Assembly for assistance in the development of a bank fi  shery and in limiting the fi  sheries of Newfoundland's rivals, the British government was determined to extract itself even more from the politics of the colony. Since 1849 there had been rare unanimity between the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council in the belief that the British government must act to help Newfoundland face French and American competition in the fi  shery. The refusal by the British introduced a split between Liberals and Conservatives on this issue, as Charles Fox Bennett led a group that decided that Newfoundland should turn to economic diversifi  cation. Opposing Liberals, led by Ambrose Shea, hoped that the British might negotiate reductions in American bounties for fi  sh during the talks that established reciprocity between the United States and British North America in 1854. While such reductions did not develop, Shea's group accepted the 1854 treaty in the hope that freer access to the American market would lead to better prices for Newfoundland fi  sh. 47

The British government wanted to be rid of the political demands coming from Newfoundland. With a general election looming, Governor Hamilton did his best to block responsible government by postponing the election. Bishop Mullock denounced the action, and Little travelled to London to condemn the governor's behaviour and to petition for his removal. In Newfoundland, some of the older Liberals tried to revive the old Irish Roman Catholic tactics of Fleming's time, but they were brought to heel by Mullock. The Conservatives tried to fight the Liberals by splitting off their Methodist supporters through fear  of  the  old  Irish  Roman  Catholic  sectarianism.  Core  Methodist support held for the Liberals, and they again won a general election. In the new legislature, Little claimed that only the Liberals had the confi  dence of the people; the new administration must be constructed from its members. The Colonial Offi  ce instructed the new governor, Darling, to ask Little to form a government.

Throughout  the  election,  the  Liberals  had  resurrected  the  hoary wage lien issue to appeal to fi  shermen. The new Liberal government, in the fall of 1855, passed an act establishing fi  shing servants' preferential lien for their wages on fi  sh received from planters by merchants. The lien did little  for  fi  shing  people;  just  as  had  the  previous  1824 Fisheries Act, the new law defi  ned the wage lien in terms of planter insolvency. 48 By doing so, the law implicitly recognized that the real problem facing fi  shing people had little do with whether or not someone guaranteed to pay wages. The cost of hiring labour could not be justifi  ed within a fi  shing industry dominated by the trade of a lowvalue commodity in international markets and persistent problems with localized depletion of natural resources.

The Liberals had won the battle for responsible government in 1855 but, with their Conservative opponents, had unleashed potent sectarian and class forces. Despite their many appeals, the Liberals hammered home one consistent message to British offi  cials: Newfoundland had great economic potential in its landward resources. These resources required only the guiding hand of a colonial government responsible to the people and not to selfi  sh merchants. Once developed properly, Newfoundland would no longer depend on troubled fi  sheries alone, and there would be little need for public relief of the poor. The Liberals had promised much and now would have to try to deliver. Whatever was to come of such promises, the Liberals had shifted colonial state policy and much of the colony's political culture decisively from an awareness of the extent to which most people depended on the resources of the sea.

## Responsible Government and Landward Industrialization, 1855-1895

Philip Francis Little, Newfoundland's fi  rst premier under responsible government, had to live up to twenty years of Reformers' and Liberals' promises. They had argued that a colonial government that was responsible directly to the people of the colony, not to the Colonial Offi  ce or the arbitrary whims of an individual offi  ceholder, could diversify the economy and ease the old rancour of political life. Sadly, 'responsible' government would become the quixotic ideal of generations  of  politicians  who  were  never  able  to  come  to  grips  with  the material reality of people who lived by the sea. Beginning with the misguided attempt of early governments to foster an industrial economy such as that which was developing in Canada, Newfoundland administrations rarely addressed the fact that most people depended on marine resources.

Once  Newfoundland  politicians  took  control  over  the  executive, their  attention  turned  away  from  the  fi  shery.  Despite  the  fact  that Newfoundland's  life  was  international  trade,  Britain  continued  to control foreign relations, and so the colony was unable to negotiate directly with foreign countries. Worse, both the French and Americans had rights to parts of Newfoundland's coast and waters, secured by British treaties. These treaties prevented the Newfoundland legislature from developing the resources of the island's west coast and from regulating the fi  shery. The Liberals had hoped that free trade with the United States would increase American demand for fi  sh, revive prices, and perhaps stimulate new fi  sheries, but the Reciprocity Treaty had not limited American fi  shing in Newfoundland waters,

while the French retained an exclusive right to fi  sh  on  the  'French Shore,' limiting its development by Newfoundlanders.

Angered by the growth of French fi  shing on the Shore and on the Grand Banks, Newfoundland offi  cials  expected  the  British  government  to  insist  on  concurrent  Newfoundland  rights  to  the  French Shore and to support its efforts to regulate the bait trade with French fishers. Motivated by a desire to avoid confl  ict with France, however, in 1857 the British government sided with the French, allowing Newfoundlanders only limited rights to fi  sh on parts of the west coast and confi  rming much of France's claim to exclusive fi  shing rights. France could even expand its rights to fi  sh in Labrador waters and on the south coast of Newfoundland.

A  colonial  delegation  to  London  persuaded  the  British  to  back away from the 1857 convention, and British Colonial Secretary Henry Labouchere agreed that London would not thereafter enter into any international  agreement  which  diminished  Newfoundland's  rights without the consent of its domestic legislature. But his 'Labouchere Dispatch,'  hailed  as  the  colony's  Magna  Carta,  did  little  to  assist Newfoundland with the practical problem of managing the fi  shery. Although the colonial government claimed the right to regulate all fisheries in local waters for conservation purposes, British authorities intimated that if such regulations bothered the French, Britain would become less vigilant in policing French treaty rights. 1

Denominational politics further hampered the Liberal government. While Methodist support had been essential to their election, the Liberals' strength lay with their Roman Catholic constituents, and Bishop Mullock expected to be rewarded for supporting responsible government. Methodist alienation from the government grew when, in 1858, Little resigned to accept an appointment to the Supreme Court, and John Kent, the old sectarian warrior of the Fleming years, succeeded Little as premier. Kent represented a conservative, pro-clerical, and St John's Irish wing of the Liberals that was increasingly at odds with a more outport-oriented, pro-native, and occasionally anti-clerical progressive faction, and his leadership made it diffi  cult for the Liberals to present themselves as a party of progress and development. Through 1858 the Conservative opposition demanded an end to French claims to an exclusive fi  shery on the French Shore, and James Tobin, a member  of  the  Legislative  Council  and  the  colony's  fi  nancial  secretary, supported the opposition by insisting on a stringent enforcement of concurrent rights on the French Shore. The Liberals wanted the governor to suspend Tobin, and certainly he made the government look

hesitant in its fi  sheries policy and the opposition vigorous by comparison.

In 1859, the British government announced that it would appoint a joint commission with the French to investigate possible solutions on the French Shore, but it failed to resolve the issue. Frustrated by British infl  uence over its fi  sheries, and faced with poverty at home, the colonial government fell back on the old habit of trying to encourage more agricultural development, while the opposition demanded unsuccessfully that the government establish a fi  sheries board to manage fisheries in such a way as to supplement economic diversifi  cation. 2

Under Kent, patronage rather than principle dominated policy. He courted the St John's electorate by able-bodied relief spending on local road construction, a policy that appealed to the large working-class population of Irish Catholic origin in the town. This antagonized Bishop Mullock, who had never been warm toward the old Liberal's style of  Irish  sectarianism and who had expected the government to encourage a broader program of agricultural improvement through road construction and railway development. Ambrose Shea, now speaker of  the  House  of  Assembly,  favoured  similar  development  policies. Continuing to lead the nativist wing of the Liberals, Shea appears to have led those Liberals who were tired of Kent's sectarian patronage. Early in 1859, Shea threatened to resign as speaker: he had expected to be consulted before Kent took up a position with the Anglo-French Commission investigating the fi  shery and may have hoped to take the position himself. Kent passed a resolution in the House begging Shea to stay on, but the Liberals were now divided. While spending money on relief in the St John's area might temporarily alleviate poverty, Mullock could not see how it would lead to lasting development and disapproved of the government's inattention to the outports. In 1860, Kent refused to honour a deal Mullock and Little had earlier negotiated with a New York fi  rm to acquire a steamer to improve communications with the outports. The refusal was a personal affront to Mullock, who now believed the outports could expect nothing good from the Kent government, and in June, he publicly denounced the Liberal government, setting the stage for its collapse. 3

The Conservatives wanted to build a new political alliance between Protestants and Roman Catholic advocates of development and favoured integrating fi  sheries management into a broader program of development. The Liberals, by contrast, appeared reluctant to fi  ght the imperial government's disallowance of new colonial bait legislation to regulate the French fi  shery in 1860. Conservative leader Hugh

W. Hoyles, sensing Kent's weakness on the French Shore issue, pressured the government to establish conservation measures that would limit the French fi  shery. Conservative newspapers noted the oddity of the colonial government establishing a board to oversee agricultural development but not one for fi  sheries. Even Governor Sir Alexander Bannerman (who had come to Newfoundland in 1857) pointed out that the Newfoundland government needed to establish fi  sheries policy, and there were growing demands from fi  shers around the island for conservation regulations that would restrict the plethora of new fishing gears being deployed around the coast. However, although the Liberal government investigated the seal hunt, it did little else. 4

While  the  Conservatives  championed  sounder  colonial  development policy, the Liberal government was mired in relief controversies. More of Kent's supporters revolted against his arbitrary administration  of  relief.  In  January  1861,  members  of  the  House  of  Assembly claimed that they should sit on relief boards, while Bishop Mullock wanted relief to be administered by clergy. Bannerman, who disliked his limited authority under responsible government, let Kent know that he would dismiss the administration if it lost his confi  dence. In February, Kent proposed to pay government salaries, including the governor's, in local colonial currency rather than the more valuable British pound sterling. The justices of the Supreme Court as well as the governor protested, and Kent responded by accusing the governor of being politically allied with the Conservative opposition. While such an accusation may have had merit since Bannerman seemed sympathetic to Hoyles's party, premiers normally did not question the integrity of the offi  ce of the governor; Bannerman used the episode as an excuse to dismiss Kent's government and request that Hoyles form an administration.

Bannerman's actions were constitutionally questionable, offended the spirit of responsible government, and dismayed Bishop Mullock since Hoyles recruited Laurence O'Brien, a Roman Catholic merchant, to augment what was primarily a Protestant administration. Mullock had wanted the Liberals to bend to his will and had not anticipated losing infl  uence over government to a largely Protestant Conservative party that had never supported the broad economic diversifi  cation platform of the Liberals. Initially, he portrayed the Conservatives as greedy merchants seeking to squeeze dry the Catholic fi  shers of Newfoundland just as Irish landlords were squeezing their tenants, but the Anglican bishop, Edward Feild, declared his support for Hoyles, his old political ally. However, popular opposition to the Conservatives

forming a government without an election forced Bannerman to dissolve the Assembly.

Victory in the ensuing election hinged upon two districts in Conception Bay. Both sides used violence and intimidation, which quickly assumed class and sectarian overtones. Fishers and sealers rallied to the Liberal candidate in Harbour Grace, James Prendergast, but local magistrates refused to open the polls. Tensions ran high throughout Carbonear and St John's, as Liberal supporters threatened or attacked the property of Conservative merchant candidates. Violence tainted the elections in the district of Harbour Main, where no Conservatives ran, and where rival groups of Roman Catholics fought each other. Two candidates, Hogsett and Charles Furey, had the local bishop's support, and another two, Thomas Byrne and Patrick Nowlan, preferred  to  have  less  clerical  infl  uence.  The  governor  intervened,  declaring the Harbour Main returns invalid. The Liberals believed they would have won the seats and, therefore, a majority in the House of Assembly. As it stood, the election result was fourteen Tory seats and twelve for the Liberals. When the legislature was called into session, Bishop Mullock and the Liberals encouraged public protest, which led to violence outside the Colonial Building. Troops dispersed the crowd by opening fi  re, killing three people and wounding twenty, including  a  Roman  Catholic  priest.  Sporadic  violence  continued  in Harbour Main, but the new Conservative majority agreed to allow the Liberal candidates to take their seats in the Assembly. Later winning two more seats in a Harbour Grace by-election, Hoyles ended Liberal domination in the Assembly. 5

Once election fever had cooled, fi  sheries policy emerged as a pressing concern in districts around the island. The Hoyles government capitalized on popular indignation about French fi  shing rights to regulate the herring fi  shery in 1862. New legislation prohibited seining during the spawning season, established a minimum mesh size of 2.5 inches, and forbade the barring of herring in coves and using seines within a mile of settlements on the south coast, thus limiting French access  to  herring  bait.  Then,  later  in  1862,  the  Hoyles  government bowed to popular pressure for fi  sheries conservation by appointing Conception Bay MHA John Rorke to a select committee to inquire into the fi  shery.

The legislature received many petitions from around Newfoundland  demanding  restrictions  on  new  fi  shing  gear,  such  as  bultows and cod seines. In Placentia Bay, popular violence against people who deployed these gears forced a Supreme Court investigation. Rorke's

committee received evidence from 104 merchants, fi  shers, planters, magistrates, and government offi  cials throughout the winter of 18623.  Fishers  and  merchants,  including  a  few  from  Labrador,  testifi  ed about a variety of wasteful practices such as the catching and dumping of juvenile fi  sh, and many warned that the day might come when cod  would  be  exhausted.  Most  favoured  a  variety  of  conservation measures and gear restrictions, but a small number argued that the state had no business restraining the right of individuals to use whatever fi  shing gear they chose. Rorke proposed an omnibus fi  sheries bill that would have introduced sweeping measures to ban some gears, such as bultows, and regulate the use of others, such as cod jiggers, seines, and gill nets. In the end, anyone could fi  nd something to oppose in the bill, despite agreeing with many of its provisions. Liberal opposition to the bill, along with Hoyles's recognition that the imperial government would not support its regulations if they affected the French or the Americans, led to its failure to become law. 6

The Conservatives also turned to interior development by able-bodied relief programs in road construction. The government's boards, designed  to  oversee  the  administration  of  road  programs,  quickly became mired in sectarian patronage struggles over who would run them. An invitation in 1864 by the Canadian proponents of British North American union to send delegates to a conference at Quebec seemed opportune to consider solutions to the colony's diffi  culties. Premier  Hoyles  thought  a  united  British  North  America  could  afford better fi  sheries management and would also have the resources to invest in economic diversifi  cation. The colony remained plagued by economic depression in the fi  shery, and, with most of the capital generated in Newfoundland tied up in the fi  sh trade, there seemed little  way to break out of the constant relief problems that strained government coffers  and  fuelled  sectarian  strife.  Hoyles  hoped  that an infusion of Canadian capital might trigger change and sought to build a bipartisan consensus for union by appointing Frederick Carter (a Conservative MHA) and Ambrose Shea (as a voice for the Roman Catholics)  to  represent  Newfoundland  at  the  negotiations  between delegates  of  the  British  North  American  colonies.  Since  his  experience with trade negotiations with the United States in the 1850s, Shea argued that the Newfoundland economy would grow and diversify through closer ties with continental economies. He had become an enthusiast for railways as engines of economic development and saw Canadian capital and interest in railway development as useful for Newfoundland. Along with John Kent, Shea urged the government to

abandon fi  sheries reform and devote its efforts to a renewed economic diversifi  cation strategy. In short, while Carter emphasized the potential for confederation to improve the regulation of the fi  shery, Shea hoped political union would encourage industrial diversifi  cation. 7

This mutually favourable view of confederation led Shea into the Conservative fold. Hoyles retired from electoral politics in 1865, and his  successor  to  the  leadership  of  the  Conservatives,  Carter,  convinced John Kent and Shea, along with Ambrose's brother E.D. Shea, to join him.  The Conservatives did not make confederation part of 8 their platform and held on to power in the fall election of that year. Carter had inherited a predominantly Protestant Conservative party but welcomed Roman Catholic and Methodist Liberals into his coalition, thus blunting criticism that his party represented only one section of the population. Those Liberals who had not been incorporated into Carter's coalition unsuccessfully ran as an opposition party.

Carter's new government began to share seats in the Assembly, Executive Council positions, government offi  ces, judicial appointments, and public monies among the major denominations - Roman Catholic,  Anglican, and Methodist - on a proportional basis. All political parties  adopted  this  'denominational  compromise,'  which  became a fundamental, if unwritten, rule of Newfoundland politics. Bishop Feild had never accepted anything less than full state support for a separate Anglican school system, even as the Methodists continued to gather in strength, forming a separate Newfoundland Conference in  1874.  Carter  cultivated  Methodist  and  Anglican  support  in  1875 by  guaranteeing  both  public  funding  for  separate  school  systems. The government took other steps to lessen the likelihood of violence and intimidation during elections. Elections were held over one day throughout a district rather than over a period of days, which made it more diffi  cult for roving bands to move from one community to another as the polls opened in each town. Carter also increased the numbers of police, instituted the secret ballot, and continued the Hoyles administration's ban on mummering, a Christmas custom in which people disguised their identity and visited each other, occasionally using their disguise as a cover to harass political enemies. 9

Shea  and  Kent  advocated  union  with  Canada  as  a  means  to  secure economic diversifi  cation. Shea and Carter suggested that Canada might assist Newfoundland with problems such as the French insistence on exclusive fi  shing rights, but much of the confederation debate focused upon union as a source of funds for diversifi  cation. In the 1860s, the infl  uence of Irish nationalism in the Newfoundland

## 132 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

Roman Catholic church led Bishop Mullock to oppose confederation. This opposition fuelled the old pattern of sectarian politics, depicting  confederation  as  a  British  invention  that  would  interfere  with the development of a unique local culture, including Irish infl  uence and the special status of denominational education. The Province of Canada, formed from the union of Canada East and Canada West in 1841, moreover, was notorious for provincial squabbling over Roman Catholic and French-Canadian minority rights.

In the past, Mullock had restrained the Irish nationalist elements within the church in debates over Newfoundland's development, but he did not believe that Canada could help with the colony's economic problems. Most of the merchants agreed, arguing that the colony's fishery could not benefi  t by the transcontinental railway, despite the fact that the Maritime provinces had turned from maritime industries to embrace the continental reorientation of much of the British North American economy that went with confederation. Opponents of confederation argued that paying higher taxes, through import duties, to support such a railway would raise the cost of living and catching fish, while Newfoundland would not benefi  t from access to Canadian markets since the colony sold all of its fi  sh in southern Europe, the West Indies, and Brazil. Newfoundland confederates promised federal backing for landward diversifi  cation as well as for better fi  sheries management, but their opponents responded that if the colony had interior resources to be developed then they should not be subject to Canadian infl  uence. 10

The Carter government campaigned for confederation in the general  election  of  1869,  but  it  faced  an  opponent  who  had  powerful nationalistic appeal. Charles Fox Bennett was a St John's merchant, but no one could accuse him of being uninterested in the economic diversifi  cation of Newfoundland: he had supported the Newfoundland  Agricultural  Society  from  its  beginning  and  had  long  been  a leading industrialist in St John's; his company had quarried slate in Conception Bay and invested in mines. By 1869 he had become a vocal  proponent  of  interior  development.  Confederates  continued  to promote union with Canada as a solution to problems in the fi  sheries but emphasized that Canada, as a pioneer in colonial landward diversifi  cation, could help Newfoundland escape greedy monopolists such as Bennett. The Confederates spoke time and again of the vast natural resources of Newfoundland, which only awaited Canadian capital  to  be  developed,  but  their  opponents  portrayed  Carter  and Shea as 'political Iscariots' willing to betray such resources into the

hands of Canadians. Preference for a local national policy of development prevailed. 11

The  1869  election  ended  in  defeat  for  the  Conservatives  and  for Canadian confederation, but the Canadian model based on railways and interior development took hold. The Bennett government relaxed controls  on  crown  land  legislation  to  open  timberlands  for  investment and began to spend more on road development, while Bennett personally benefi  ted from his government's removal of royalties on mining  income.  Although  Bennett  encouraged  mining,  he  did  not support extensive government involvement in building a railway because he felt it imprudent for government to get involved in projects that would necessitate heavy expenditures and borrowing. Then, in the early 1870s, stagnation in the economy led to an increase in emigration, and the press demanded that government invest in railway building. The world was gripped in railway fever, and people everywhere believed in the gospels of railway, progress, and development. At the same time, Bennett found himself uneasy as the leader of what was nominally a Liberal party with roots in the fi  ght for responsible government and Catholic rights, both of which he had always opposed. In the 1873 election, he barely retained the premiership, and then only by dragging out the confederation issue again. The Conservatives abandoned their support for confederation, however, and portrayed Bennett as a leader who had betrayed his own principles for the Catholic vote. In 1874, Bennett resigned as premier. His party lost a general election later that year in part because it had not moved vigorously on the railway. 12

Although  Carter's  Conservatives  regained  power  in  1874,  their economic diversifi  cation policies married older Liberal traditions to a new-found enthusiasm for railways, fuelled by the colony's diffi  cult relationship with imperial authorities over French rights and a simmering dispute with the United States over its rights in Newfoundland waters. Throughout the 1860s, Newfoundland administrations pressed the imperial government for the right to grant land on the French Shore and to appoint magistrates; London fi  nally agreed in 1869 that the Newfoundland government had very limited rights to resources on land that was located up to one-half mile from the highwater mark. The geological survey of Newfoundland by Alexander Murray suggested that the west coast had plenty of mineral resources as well as timber and land suitable for agriculture. Indeed, Nova Scotia investors had taken advantage of the jurisdictional wrangling between Britain and France to set up completely unregulated sawmilling

## 134 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

operations in the Bay of Islands, paying no royalties or taxes, using wasteful cutting practices, and polluting streams and coves with their refuse, thereby harming local fi  sheries. The Newfoundland government wanted to establish clear jurisdiction over the natural resources of the French Shore for its potential revenue and economic development, but it also claimed an interest in conservation. 13

Colonial government offi  cials worried about the settlers from many different origins who lived on the French Shore. In the late eighteenth century, English- and French-speaking settlers from the island of Jersey had come to the Strait of Belle Isle, St George's Bay, and Bonne Bay. Originally these servants of such fi  rms as Nicolle began wintering to trap furs and engage in a commercial salmon fi  shery; later they began fishing and trapping on their own accounts as settlers. Mostly Protestant, the settlers were joined later by other people of English origin from the south coast of Newfoundland. Initially, the French opposed such settlers as an infringement of their rights, but after 1815, French enterprises came to depend on settled salmon fi  shers to provide the staple of their trade. The local salmon fi  shery became so intensive that the rivers showed signs of depletion by the 1840s.

Unlike settlers elsewhere, many of those on the west coast had a Canadian connection. After 1820, Roman Catholic Acadian migration from the west coast of Cape Breton became much more important to the social development of the area from St George's Bay to Bonne Bay. By the mid-nineteenth century, the largest group of people living on the west coast was French-speaking. Settlers from St Pierre and deserting sailors and fi  shers from the French navy and migratory fi  shery on the French Shore joined the Acadian families and quickly began to populate areas such as the Port au Port Peninsula. Mi'kmaq had been migrating to the west coast from Cape Breton as early as 1763, but more began to arrive, having fl  ed Cape Breton, where they suffered from the  effects  of  overhunting,  to  settle  across  from  Sandy  Point. The Mi'kmaq relied on fur trapping, caribou and seal hunting, the eel fishery, and crafts such as basket weaving and moccasin making. The Roman Catholic community of the west coast became more complex after 1860 as kin groups of Highland Scottish settlers from Prince Edward Island and Inverness County, Cape Breton, came to the Codroy Valley, Highlands, and Campbell's Creek to search for better land. Newfoundlanders also moved to the west coast to escape the troubled fisheries of their homes after 1870. Many of these English-speaking settlers were from Conception Bay and migrated to the region by way of the Labrador fi  shery. They moved south from Labrador, searching

for new opportunities in the herring fi  sheries and timber industries of Bonne Bay and Humber Sound. Other settlers from the south coast of Newfoundland and from the Maritimes came to exploit the previously untouched forests of the coast. Especially important was the establishment of a large sawmill by Halifax investors at Corner Brook, worth more than $40,000 in 1865. The attraction of the growing sawmilling industry, as well as the better agricultural resources of places such as the Codroy Valley, meant that west coast settlement also spread into the interior shores of the coast's great bays, St George's, Bonne Bay, and the Bay of Islands. The availability of timber also led to local shipbuilding, mostly of schooners. 14

While the fi  sheries of Labrador continued to attract the interest of Newfoundlanders, the government continued to pay it little attention. Governed informally by the HBC factor at Rigolet and North West River, the latter community continued to grow in importance as the trading centre for the fur trade and salmon fi  sheries. Donald Smith, who managed the HBC's local activities from North West River, encouraged the development of roads and farming, solemnized marriages and baptisms, acted as the local judiciary, and provided basic medical services to the people who depended on the HBC. Throughout the late nineteenth century, settlers took over and operated the HBC's salmon fi  shing posts and trap lines, many of which became the nuclei for settler communities. Across Hamilton Inlet from North West River, Sheshatshiu was a seasonal gathering place of the Innu. Roman Catholic missionaries from Quebec, Jesuit and Oblate, active among the Innu of the Lake Melville area since the late eighteenth century, began to send priests to HBC posts beginning in 1867. Attracted to North West River by Oblate missionaries and the opportunity to trade for hunting rifl  es and ammunition, some Innu had begun to frequent North West River but were not welcomed by settlers there. To avoid confl  ict, the Innu kept to Sheshatshiu.

Along the coasts of Labrador, fi  shers from Newfoundland continued to move northward, commonly frequenting areas above Hamilton Inlet by the 1860s and 1870s, and the Moravians began to minister to the fi  shers from Newfoundland, partially to control their relationships with the Inuit. Along the southeast coast, many fi  shers decided to take up permanent residence. They saw lucrative opportunities for trade with visiting American schooners. The residents joined the families of former servants of West Country merchant fi  rms who had decided to settle locally and fi  sh on their own account. As in the trading territory of the HBC, southeast-coast settlement occurred by intermarriage

with small enclaves of Inuit that persisted in the south until epidemics and assimilation took their toll by the end of the nineteenth century. As  elsewhere  in  Newfoundland  in  the  early  days,  fi  shing  families lived in 'outside' stations on the coast during the spring and summer, engaged in salmon and cod fi  sheries, and then, in the fall and winter, moved into bays and inlets, setting nets for seals, hunting game, and cutting wood. The Newfoundland government provided small funds for schools, medical services, poor relief, and public works, but, overall, its attention to community needs in Labrador continued to be minimal. 15

The Newfoundland government was more interested in the French Shore, where lucrative herring and lobster fi  sheries, the latter a recent development in response to a growing American market for the canned product in the 1870s, attracted the interest of St John's merchants. But it was the landward potential of the French Shore that fed many politicians' desire that its inland resources come under Newfoundland jurisdiction. A new generation of colonial politicians believed that landward industrialization would make Newfoundland a  neighbour  of  consequence  to  Canada  and  the  United  States,  and one that Britain would have to treat better. While still in opposition, Carter's leadership of the Conservatives had nearly been usurped by younger politicians such as William Vallance Whiteway, who were committed  to  this  more  nationalistic  approach.  Whiteway  pushed forward plans for a railway across the island and terminating in St George's Bay on the French Shore. Carter was aghast at the prospect of antagonizing the French yet was able to negotiate for the right to appoint magistrates for the French Shore in 1877 by arguing that Nova Scotia timber cutters were taking wood there without paying taxes or observing Newfoundland law. While the new magistrates collected taxes and enforced the law, the British would not purchase territorial rights from the French, and London insisted it had the right to appoint magistrates, thus avoiding the question of colonial sovereignty. 16

Carter  wanted  Newfoundland  to  gain  control  over  the  French Shore but feared the expense of a railway and the ire of the imperial government if the colony acted hastily. While he may have sympathized with the nationalism of the younger members of his party, the colony still depended on British negotiation and enforcement of international fi  sheries agreements. The abrogation of the Reciprocity Treaty with the United States in 1865, for example, had displeased Americans who wished to fi  sh locally and Newfoundland merchants who desired freer access to American markets for their fi  sh, especially

herring from the French Shore and salmon. Britain and the United States negotiated the Treaty of Washington in 1871, which recognized past American treaty rights to fi  sh in Newfoundland waters, most notably as stipulated in the Convention of 1818. This time, the British government accepted that the Newfoundland legislature would have to ratify the treaty. Many Newfoundland politicians did not like the access to bait fi  sh gained by the Americans and wanted recognition of the colony's right to regulate American fi  shing for herring and salmon. The Americans, however, purchased herring as bait from Newfoundlanders living on the south coast, for whom the trade was an important part of their livelihoods. The colonial legislature accepted the deal, and the treaty came into effect in 1874. The United States agreed to compensate Newfoundland fi  nancially for the fi  shing rights it gained through an Anglo-American tribunal that was to make an award by 1877. 17

A  desire  to  assert  Newfoundland  autonomy  more  than  to  regulate  the  fi  shery  motivated  colonial  politicians'  stance  on  the  Treaty of  Washington.  Landward  economic  diversifi  cation  meant  that  the government supported open access in the fi  sheries and ignored fi  shers' demands for conservation regulations. As more intensive fi  shing technologies  appeared,  many  offi  cials  took  greater  catches  as  evidence that fi  sh stocks were inexhaustible, and, following brief periods of intense opposition, fi  shers accepted new gear introduced by better-off planters because merchants gave credit only to those willing to use the equipment or those who worked for such users. In a coastal ecology that provided few alternatives, people had to keep fi  shing regardless of poor catches or market conditions because they needed to maintain access to the merchant credit to purchase the necessities of life. Government inaction soon wore down fi  shers' concerns about the possibility of depleted fi  sh stocks. 18

Marine-resource depletion was especially evident in the seal hunt. The expansion of the schooner hunt locked sealers into a pattern of 'rapid expansion, intense competition and ruthless exploitation' that ended 'in declining resources and failure.' 19 The growth of the seal fishery had allowed population growth to occur during the nineteenth century despite the limits upon the expansion of the cod fi  shery posed by declining stocks. As the need for seal exports rose and the available seals declined, merchants invested in new technologies there too. By the 1860s, the old schooner hunt of the outports had given way to larger iron-hulled, steam-driven vessels which could penetrate deep into the ice packs in pursuit of remaining herds. Such steamers re-

quired capital beyond the means of most outport employers, and the ownership of the industry transferred from outports to St John's.

Throughout  the  period,  newspaper  correspondents  wrote  of  the need  for  conservation.  The  Bennett  government  in  the  early  1870s had acknowledged popular fears that seal herds were being annihilated but did little about it. Beginning with Whiteway's government in 1878, half-hearted attempts were made to pass seal conservation legislation, but there was constant pressure to relax such laws. Men fought  for  employment  in  the  seal  hunt  both  because  it  provided some much-needed cash each spring as their families' winter credit had been exhausted and because the work had become a male right of passage in outports of the northeast coast. Merchants also needed to employ the steamers in which they had invested so much. The colonial government passed few and ineffective regulations to protect seal populations. 20

American fi  shing rights in Newfoundland waters raised concerns about depletion of fi  sh stocks in the context of the colonial bank fi  shery.  The colony had long complained about the unfair competition from  the  subsidized  French  bank  fi  shery,  which  used  bultows;  after 1874 more American vessels deployed them as well. The use of bultows meant that American schooners in the bank fi  shery required more bait, of which they wanted cheaper supplies to offset the higher cost of the bultows. Greater numbers of American vessels appeared in  Newfoundland  inshore  waters  in  search  of  bait.  Many  of  those Newfoundland merchants and fi  shers who wanted to enter the bank fishery feared that this increased American presence would jeopardize  cod  stocks  and  deplete  bait  fi  sh  such  as  herring.  Moreover,  the Americans caught enough fi  sh to satisfy their domestic market so did not need to buy from Newfoundlanders. Newfoundlanders faced additional competition from banking schooners that sailed from Nova Scotia ports such as Lunenburg. From 1870 to 1900, Nova Scotians expanded their effort on the fi  shing banks off Newfoundland, fi  shing there from June through September. In 1876 the Newfoundland government established bounties to subsidize its own bank fi  shery. The development of the more easily stored dory also dramatically lowered costs in the banking industry, allowing Newfoundlanders to adopt the bultow. Together, these initiatives allowed the development of a small but vital  bank  fi  shery  based  upon  the  Avalon  and  Burin  peninsulas. Like the Americans and Nova Scotians, Newfoundlanders prosecuted the bank fi  shery during the summer months but increas-

ingly pushed their season into the fall and winter to take advantage of the ice-free waters of the south coast. 21

The Treaty of Washington now seemed to be an impediment to the development of the colony, and it was diffi  cult for Newfoundlanders to see how to proceed on the issues of bait and American fi  shing rights. Many south-coast fi  shers sold bait to Americans, and they feared that limiting  their  rights  to  purchase  bait  would  lead  the  Americans  to catch bait themselves. In the short term, most people hoped that the settlement of the Anglo-American tribunal would provide compensation for the rights the Americans gained, but the 1877 award was a disappointment. Compared with the $4.5 million awarded to Canada, Newfoundland received only $1 million. The American government, in turn, was indignant that it had to pay compensation and that the Anglo-American  commissioners  had  agreed  that  American  fi  shers must recognize Newfoundland's right to regulate the fi  shery in its territorial waters.

Matters came to a head in 1878, when the government decided to restrict the harvest of herring by banning fi  shing on Sundays. In January, a fl  eet of American bankers arrived in Fortune Bay to engage in a winter herring fi  shery. Rather than purchase bait by treaty right, the Americans decided to catch herring themselves. Local fi  shers were dismayed at the prospect of losing valuable winter income and feared that the Americans might sell bait to the French as well. About two dozen American vessels, equipped with huge herring seines of unusually small mesh size, began to sweep the bay at Long Harbour. On Sunday, 6 January, angry crowds began to gather on local beaches when it became apparent that the Americans would not obey Newfoundland law. Members of the crowd attacked some of the Americans, seized and destroyed their seines, dumped about two thousand barrels of herring, and drove the Americans away. The imperial government later conceded that the Americans were indeed in violation of the Newfoundland law that prohibited fi  shing on Sunday, seining in a closed season, and barring herring within a cove or other confi  ned space. This was small comfort to Newfoundland, however, because imperial authorities maintained that colonial laws passed after the signing of a treaty between Britain and a foreign power, or which departed from the terms of a treaty, could not be imposed on foreigners.

The Fortune Bay dispute, as it became known, demonstrated that fishing people could affect the highest levels of international relations. Already aggrieved at the Halifax award, the American government

complained loudly  about  alleged  mistreatment  of  its  fi  shers  in  the hope that it might get out of the obligations of the award, reduce the payment, or get additional fi  shing rights in compensation. The Newfoundland government worried when the Americans suggested that the incident might irreparably damage Anglo-American relations. At that point, the British Foreign and Colonial Offi  ces stepped in, threatening the small steps Newfoundland had taken toward greater colonial sovereignty. Ambrose Shea came to the forefront of the fi  ght to maintain Newfoundland's rights. He argued that the British must support Newfoundland's right to regulate the bait trade; it was a matter of the colony having the right to decide how its resources should be best developed. To Shea, Newfoundland's right to regulate the bait trade was simply another implication of responsible government. In the  end,  the  British  government  agreed  that  the  Americans  would have to obey Newfoundland law. 22

Fisheries issues did not disappear from the agenda, but Whiteway, who succeeded Carter as premier, had other priorities. On many occasions Whiteway stated that he did not think that government could do much to regulate fi  sheries, and he did not want to do anything to jeopardize Newfoundland's portion of the Halifax award, most of which he already had earmarked to support railway development. He advised the British to allow the Americans to resume their fi  shing rights quietly under the Convention of 1818, since British warships on patrol in Fortune Bay were not about to provoke the Americans by trying to enforce Newfoundland laws. Indeed, a new British government in 1880 paid $750,000 in damages to the Americans and, while Whiteway got his $1 million, it was a low price for selling the opportunity to regulate its fi  sheries. He did not completely abandon the fishery,  however,  but  conservation  took  a  back  seat  to  the  government's priority - industrial diversifi  cation. In 1879 the government dedicated $4,000 from the Halifax award for a commission of inquiry on the fi  sheries and $102,300 to build telegraph lines. While Whiteway considered appointing a superintendent for a permanent bureau of fi  sheries, the government established no actual commission until 1888. 23

The disputes with France and the United States reinforced Whiteway's commitment to colonial development through railway construction.  He hoped such development would open up the agricultural, timber, and mineral resources of the island, tie the French Shore more closely to the capital, and serve as a symbol of progress for a dynamic new nation. The premier suggested that fi  nancial assistance for rail-

way  development  by  the  British  empire  would  compensate  Newfoundland for the lack of support on issues such as the French Shore, but in 1880, Whiteway had to announce government support for a more modest project when it became clear that no British help was forthcoming. He proposed a rail line from St John's to Hall's Bay, Notre Dame Bay, with a branch to Harbour Grace. Notre Dame Bay (especially its mining areas) and the Avalon Peninsula were two of the most densely populated areas of the colony. The lumber industry of the Gambo and Gander rivers was developing quickly, and the lands at the bottom of Trinity and Bonavista bays were more suitable for farming than any that could be found around the fi  shing communities of the outer headlands. The government awarded a contract to a New York syndicate to build the railway in return for annual subsidies of $180,000, loans, tax exemptions, and a land grant of 5,000 acres per mile.

The resulting Newfoundland Railway Company (NRC) began construction in 1881, although the government had not investigated its financial resources carefully enough. 24 Whiteway's mercantile opponents worried about the expense of even this modest project, not because they opposed the railway in principle, but because they did not think it was worth potential bankruptcy for the colony; they feared that their trade would be taxed through tariffs to raise revenue for its construction. Whiteway's party had begun as a Conservative one backed by Liberals such as Shea, but he now found himself the leader of the Liberal party, as the Conservative merchants of St John's had abandoned the premier.

Outport  people  also  feared  the  railway.  The  rail  bed  and  surrounding right of way would intrude on the gardens, pastures, local woodlands, and other areas used in common by people. Earlier developments, such as the Electric Telegraph Company in 1857, had led residents of Twillingate, Fogo, and Green Bay to protest, occasionally by cutting telegraph poles, the enclosure of woods they had always used for materials for the fi  shery. Rather than seeing the woods as the  common property  of  fi  shing  people,  however,  the  government viewed them as 'waste' land that could be granted to the telegraph company to encourage development projects. 25

The proposed railway would be a greater problem on the south side  of  Conception  Bay,  a  densely  settled  area  with  a  plethora  of private  and  common  property  rights  held  by  fi  shers  and  farmers. The Conservative opponents of the railway, seeing popular anxiety as  an  opportunity,  encouraged  rumours  that  the  railway  company

would annex farm land, establish booths to charge tolls for anyone who wished to cross the rail track, and charge people if their animals crossed the line. They also suggested that the railway was a plot to manoeuvre Newfoundland into confederation with Canada. When a group of engineers tried to survey a right-of-way through the south side of Conception Bay from Topsail to Indian Pond in 1881, people followed the engineers as they worked. Rumours spread that the stick used by the surveyors, tipped with a piece of red fl  annel, stood for the Canadian fl  ag and that wherever the surveyors measured, people would lose their land. At Foxtrap, the crowd began to throw stones at the engineers, driving them away and seizing their tools, and the arrival of a small force of police led to open rioting. Additional protests occurred episodically through 1882. While men and women of all ages, as well as children, participated in the rioting, women were prominent in what became known as the Battle of Foxtrap, using their aprons to carry caches of stones, which they used to great effect in driving away employees of the railway and police. 26

Whiteway responded as a Liberal by painting the Conservatives as pawns of the fi  sh merchants. He emphasized the importance of the railway in stimulating economic diversifi  cation and jobs that would finally break the grip of fi  sh merchants and truck on Newfoundland. To counter worries about the expense of the project, his government approved a  narrow-gauge  railway  rather  than  the  more  expensive broad-gauge lines being constructed in Canada and the United States. The governor of Newfoundland, John H. Glover, opposed the contract because he worried about the growing importance of American capital in the colony and thought (with much mercantile support) that the syndicate did not have the needed fi  nancial resources. By 1882, the NRC, borrowing heavily against the government contract, was sinking into fi  nancial trouble and becoming a potential political liability.

Whiteway's Liberals faced a strong coalition of St John's fi  sh merchants, who backed the 'New Party' led by prominent merchant Walter Baine Grieve and James J. Rogerson in the general election of 1882. The  New  Party's  platform  was  opposition  to  the  railway  contract, but it did not prevail in the face of the Liberals' ability to make an asset from an apparent liability. Whiteway presented the railway as the sword that would slay the merchant dragon of Water Street. The Roman Catholic Church hierarchy supported Whiteway, as did merchants in Conception Bay and Notre Dame Bay, who stood to gain by the railway as it passed through their areas. The government also used employment on the railway as a patronage measure. The strate-

gy paid off. Whiteway gained a majority of 27 out of the 33 seats in the House. The NRC was bankrupt by 1884, leaving the colony with debt and eighty-four miles of poor narrow-gauge rail line on the Avalon Peninsula. Nevertheless, Whiteway had built a broad interdenominational coalition to support his economic progress platform. As long as it seemed that their hopes might be realized, the coalition remained solid.

The coalition weakened as it became apparent that the merchants of  Water  Street  might  be  right.  There  had  been  no  take-off  in  economic diversifi  cation as a result of the railway, and the colony had become mired in a fi  nancial mess while the fi  shery languished under heavy taxes. A.J.W. MacNeilly emerged as leader of the New Party and  immediately  took  advantage  of  Whiteway's  close  association with the failed railway. Under MacNeilly, the New Party also played the sectarian hand by allying with the Orange Order against Roman Catholic support for Whiteway. On Boxing Day, 1883, members of the Order marched through a Roman Catholic neighbourhood in Harbour Grace. Confl  ict followed, deteriorating into open fi  ghting that left three Orangemen and one Roman Catholic man dead. The community was so divided that a subsequent trial found it impossible to find witnesses who could prove the guilt of the Roman Catholics accused of the Orangemen's deaths. The trial was a huge political show, with Whiteway and the Grand Master of the Orange Order serving as the prosecution, and Catholic politicians acting for the defence. A British naval ship, the HMS Tenedos , stood by at St John's in case of additional violence. A supporter of Whiteway, MHA Alfred Penney of Carbonear, introduced a motion in the Assembly in February 1885 declaring the acquittals a miscarriage of justice and risked alienating Roman Catholic support for the government. Whiteway proposed a weak amendment, but he had lost the support of important Catholic members of his government such as Robert Kent, W.S. Donnelly, and Ambrose Shea. He resigned as premier, and many of his Protestant supporters coalesced with the New Party to form the Reform Party. Under Sir Robert Thorburn, the Reform Party won the ensuing general election of October 1885. 27

The sectarian political  role  played  by  the  Loyal  Orange  Association (LOA) in the 1880s refl  ected the persistent paternalism of popular politics. The absence of public means for the relief of working-class and fi  shing people distressed by the economic downturns of the 1860s produced much discontent. Roman Catholic members of the St John's establishment recognized that they could allay disgruntlement and

mobilize the political support of working people through charity and patronage dispensed through the Benevolent Irish Society (BIS), which had developed a largely Roman Catholic constituency. Not to be outdone, Protestants turned to the LOA in 1863, which spread quickly throughout Protestant outports, especially along the northeast coast, helped by the patronage of politicians such as MacNeilly. Members of the BIS and the LOA were not simply dupes of colonial politicians. For the many fi  shers who joined the LOA, for example, holding offi  ce and playing public roles in its marches, funeral processions, and mutualaid activities gave them publicly recognized and respected leadership roles in their communities. In the 1870s, the Roman Catholic Church formed the Star of the Sea Association and the Anglican Church organized the Society of United Fishermen, which had a mutual assistance mandate for their members similar to the LOA's. 28

Working-class paternalism did not mean that workers were quiescent.  Rather,  they  asserted  themselves  within  their  community  but without engaging in class confl  ict. By their presence in church-affi  liated organizations, for example, workers were able to demand that the St John's mercantile and professional bourgeoisie take notice of their needs. Again, and more directly, as in the west end of the city, where most of their number lived, skilled workers and artisans dominated the lay administration of the Anglican parish of St Mary's and fostered a more democratic and communal approach to decision making than existed in the upper-class-led St Thomas's in the east end. The  St  Mary's  congregation  visibly  insisted  upon  its  respectability by requiring High Church ritualism and organizing its poor relief as communal fundraising and social occasions rather than as bourgeois acts of dispensation. 29

Throughout St John's, the growth of manufacturing meant that tailors,  typographers,  joiners,  retail  clerks,  seal  skinners,  shipwrights, wheelwrights,  sailmakers,  tanners,  and  a  variety  of  other  skilled workers formed craft unions. Like the sectarian fraternities, these unions concentrated on providing benefi  ts to their members and occasionally striking to protect their interests. They could be very effective in dealing with employers: in the 1870s, for example, organized coopers had been so successful in establishing and enforcing employers' observance of a fee schedule for daily wage rates that some St John's merchants recruited German coopers who were anxious to escape the proletarianization of their trade at home. However, the craft unions did not involve themselves in party politics. 30

The most dynamic organization to catch the attention of working people was religious in nature. In 1886, representatives of the Salvation Army fi  rst came to St John's. The Army's parades and open meetings soon attracted young people, especially the many single working women, often domestic servants from the outports, who were otherwise alone and without much support in the city. These women found that they could engage in the same work and attain the same rank as men in the Army's service. In one year, the Salvation Army expanded rapidly to Brigus, Carbonear, Greenspond, Bonavista, Catalina, and Twillingate. By the end of 1887, it had established additional barracks in Burin, Grand Bank, and Bay Roberts. In St John's, young working men and visiting fi  shing crews learned that they could attend the Army's worship and social activities without worrying about the state of their clothing and without feeling uneasy in barracks that emphasized humility and practicality rather than ostentation and idolatry in their decoration. Working people from the outports who joined the Army became its missionaries, holding meetings on the fl  akes and stages, stores, lofts, and shops of coastal communities throughout the colony. The uniforms and the regalia of the Salvation Army were novel and entertaining but, more importantly, represented the outward manifestations of a commitment to the equality of the saved before God and the ability of the members from any social background to become offi  cers. 31

The Thorburn government believed that the best way it could help the people of the colony was to turn its attention back to the fi  shery. Whiteway had encouraged diversifi  cation within the fi  shery as part of his larger industrial diversifi  cation strategy but had paid little attention to the management problems of marine resources. Government had promoted the bank fi  shery, and the exploitation of new fi  shing grounds off the northern coast of Labrador as older ones showed signs of exhaustion, and had used the telegraph to allow fi  shers to shift effort rapidly to those areas reporting good catches. It also encouraged the construction of larger inshore fi  shing craft that could sail farther out into headland areas looking for newer fi  shing grounds. There was also diversifi  cation into the herring and lobster fi  sheries, and the 1888 Fisheries Commission, under the supervision of Adolph Neilsen, considered, then established, a cod hatchery. 32 While this demonstrates an awareness that cod stocks were not bearing up well under all this new harvesting pressure, such efforts also point to government reluctance to conserve marine resources by limiting the harvest. A cod hatchery

could not address the complex problems of declining fi  sh resources in the wake of the strategic failure to reduce Newfoundlanders' dependence on the fi  sheries.

Neilsen did not advocate conservation as much as the belief that science could enhance the natural resources available for exploitation or undo the environmental damage fi  shing had infl  icted. As superintendent of the Newfoundland Department of Fisheries, created in 1893, the Norwegian-born scientist was instrumental in establishing an industrial whale hunt conducted from Newfoundland and Labrador shores. There had been earlier Newfoundland and Scottish experiments with commercial whaling, but these had been small in scale. In 1896, a joint Newfoundland-Norwegian Company, the Cabot Steam Whaling Co. Ltd., established whale-processing factories at Snooks's Arm, Notre Dame Bay, and Balaena, Hermitage Bay. The company used the latest in steam-vessel, cannon, and exploding-harpoon technologies to slaughter a variety of whale species. Soon, Newfoundland companies established more than twenty-one whaling stations around the colony, producing whale oil and bone. Unused whale offal initially posed a signifi  cant pollution problem wherever the factories appeared, but the consequent appearance of large fl  ocks of gulls around whale factories led to the development of an operation to convert the offal into fertilizer.

Whalers hunted every species, including the planet's largest animal, the blue whale. The jeopardy to whale populations was clear, particularly since the Norwegians had come to Newfoundland, with the willing assistance of local capitalists, because Norway's own whale stocks had been exhausted in a westward pattern extending from Finnmark through Iceland and the Faeroe Islands. Newfoundland did not escape this pattern of depletion, although the government attempted to save the industry by legislation (which served as the model for later Canadian regulations) in 1902. By 1906 the whale populations were in trouble, and many Newfoundlanders who had become skilled in the work and management of the industry moved on to the emerging whaling industry in British Columbia. 33

Fisheries industrialization was most pronounced in the lobster fi  shery. American, Nova Scotian, and Newfoundland investors built canneries, employing about one thousand people, on the French Shore in  the  1870s  and  1880s.  The  French  government  protested  that  the processing facilities were within the high-water mark that delimited its  rights and interfered with French fi  sheries. St Pierre-based merchants built factories on the west coast and recruited labour from the

Luckily for Newfoundland, global strategic and trade issues meant that the French and British were ready to settle the long-standing problem of the French Shore. Whiteway's government had been well disposed to a settlement proposed by imperial negotiators that had arisen from an 1881 complaint by the French government, although imperial wrangling delayed its implementation. Thorburn's party, more oriented to fish merchants than railway promotion, preferred a fi  sheries development policy based on undercutting French competition through more bait legislation. Through 1888 the Thorburn government passed bait regulations that limited the French cod fi  shery, which made France less  conciliatory  on  the  irritants  arising  out  of  French  treaty  rights. Finally, French attempts to interfere with the construction of lobster factories led to heated protests by Newfoundlanders. In 1889, the British and French agreed to a modus vivendi , recognizing a French right to fish for lobsters and providing for the continuation of Newfoundland canneries only with the consent of British and French offi  cials who policed the French Shore. 34

Although some local protests began against the modus vivendi , they wilted in the shadow of a looming economic crisis. The Thorburn government replaced the Whiteway railway policy with a modest program to promote Newfoundland fi  shing rights at the expense of the French, to build roads, and to encourage more agriculture. His government found, as had many before it, that Newfoundland's ecology and limited markets would not support much agricultural development. With the exception of the Codroy Valley, some land around Corner Brook, and the farms in the vicinity of St John's, Newfoundland remained a maritime economy in which people fi  shed and hunted seals, although work in shipping, usually on schooners, whether in taking fish to markets abroad or in coasting for cargoes along the eastern seaboard of North America, became the most important supplementary activity of outport men by the end of the nineteenth century. 35

Thorburn completed the railway to Hall's Bay, but Whiteway campaigned as the Liberal party's friend of the working man, promising to revive the economy by a reinvigorated program of railway development, although he had no idea about how to pay for it. One possibility lay in the proposal of the Nova Scotia-born A.B. Morine, who had come to St John's in 1883 to take up the editorship of the Evening Mercury . Morine saw his political fortune in persuading the Newfoundland government to enter into confederation with Canada. In frequent

contact with the Canadian government, Morine promised that Newfoundland, as a province, would no longer be a competing interest at the negotiating table with the Americans or British imperial offi  cials on matters related to fi  shing  rights.  Whiteway found attractive the notion that Canada would provide the fi  nancial resources and capital to  back  economic  diversifi  cation  in  Newfoundland.  Confederation, however, was inconsistent with the economic nationalism of many of Whiteway's supporters, such as his lieutenant Robert Bond, who did not like Morine's growing infl  uence over Whiteway and suspected that  confederation  would  again  prove  too  unpopular  to  be  carried successfully. The Liberals turned away from confederation and won the general election of 1889 on their old development platform. 36

While nationalism remained important in Newfoundland's political culture, signifi  cant economic problems threatened to undermine it as the nineteenth century came to an end. One reason Thorburn's government  had  supported  agricultural  resettlement  was  the  persistent poor fi  sh catches in long-settled parts of Newfoundland and Labrador. While the Whiteway government supported the fi  sheries commission,  its  economic  development  policies  overshadowed  the body. Probably the most signifi  cant problem was the persistence of poorly understood ecological problems in the fi  shery, particularly on the northeast coast. By the 1890s colonial newspapers identifi  ed two related trends. First, shortfalls in catches encouraged the introduction of new fi  shing gears. Second, these new gears contributed to a decline in the quality of the fi  sh. Fishers had been setting gill nets since the 1860s and cod traps, a box-shaped net fi  xed in the water with buoys and anchors, by the 1890s, which allowed fi  sh to be caught without the presence of fi  shermen. These gears were, of course, less discriminatory than trawl lines and trapped both large fi  sh and small. So, while catching capacity doubled by 1884, catches fell and had to be boosted by expansion into new areas off the south and west coasts of the island and on the Grand Banks, where fi  shers could work ice-free waters during the winter. Since the 1860s, fi  shers had moved steadily northward along the Labrador coast. This 'fl  oater fi  shery' was different from the previous one, which had largely been conducted from shore stations by residents ('stationers') carried by merchants in the Strait of Belle Isle. The fl  oaters remained aboard their vessels, roaming  the  northern  Labrador  fi  shing  grounds.  The  farther  north  they moved, the shorter the fi  shing season, but cod traps were an intensive fishing gear. The smaller average size of Labrador fi  sh, longer period of  handling,  and  poorer  weather conditions for drying contributed

signifi  cantly  to  the  poorer  reputation  of  Newfoundland  salt  fi  sh  in international markets. 37

Merchants responded by purchasing Labrador fi  sh tal  qual ('as  it comes,' or bought for one price regardless of quality). The practice of tal qual gave fi  shers even less incentive to put time and effort into producing a good-quality cure, since a larger quantity of poorer fi  sh would pay them more. Poor quality led to poor marketing practices, which in turn exacerbated the problem of quality. Merchants tried to make money from a poor-quality product by shipping as much fi  sh as fast as possible to market in the hope of beating competitors. Fish buyers would not initially be sure how much fi  sh would be available that season, and paid premium prices. Once other shipments arrived and started to undersell each other, fi  sh began to fl  ood the market and prices dropped. Every merchant knew that the best prices tended to be those paid fi  rst, so they preferred to ship quantity over quality if it would make the difference in getting a full cargo before competitors. Merchants knew that the overall effect of their marketing strategies was to glut the market and lower prices for everyone, but in the competitive culture of Water Street they could not combine to set a fl  oor price.

Other  factors  were  beyond  merchants'  control.  They  faced  high import tariffs in Spain, Portugal, and Italy, the strongest markets for high-quality  salt  cod  -  the  merchantable  and  Madeira  grades.  The best markets for poor-grade fi  sh were in Brazil and the West Indies, which did not use high tariffs to tax fi  sh imports for revenue. The Foreign Offi  ce in London was often sympathetic to Newfoundland's desire for lower duties upon fi  sh, but Newfoundland was too small a part of the British empire to be worth antagonizing European trading partners by pressuring them to lower tariffs on fi  sh. Taken together, these market conditions make it hardly surprising that merchants saw little reason to cooperate with each other in trying to produce a good product for high-end markets. 38

The many new fi  shing gears and larger vessels required to bolster catch rates meant that the overhead costs of the fi  shery continued to rise  even as the price for Newfoundland fi  sh fell. To make matters worse, the number of people who relied on the fi  shery for a living grew at a rate that outstripped catch rates. In effect, the human population continued to grow while the resource population shrank, and merchants now sought to decrease their labour supply. 39  Although many young people left the outports, the demand for credit, for both provisions and new gear, grew even as merchants found investment

in the industry less attractive. St John's merchant fi  rms had come to dominate  the  colonial  industry  throughout  the  nineteenth  century because, unlike the old transatlantic fi  rms, they concentrated on the managerial  requirements  of  the  trade  and  other  activities  through rough periods while pushing the risk of advancing winter supply to outport merchants. By the end of the nineteenth century the largest firms specialized in the wholesale and retail functions related to the import and export business. Such specialization, in combination with the  worsening market conditions for salt fi  sh,  meant that the large fish merchant fi  rms became less interested in the business of producing fi  sh as a commodity for sale in international markets. Now they were only taking fi  sh as a medium of payment from the outport consumers, who had no cash to pay for the goods they bought. Even as the demand for credit among households increased, St John's fi  rms withdrew capital from production in the industry by concentrating on investment in their importing, exporting, and wholesale operations. They invested, for example, in expensive steamers to facilitate even more rapid marketing, and in the other economic projects sponsored by the government.

Much of the day-to-day supply of the fi  shing families was left to smaller merchants and dealers in the outports. Outport merchants reacted to the erosion of their profi  t margin by restricting credit to only those fi  shers who used more capital-intensive gears and boats. Cod traps served as useful collateral for merchants' credit, but they could not stem the ecological and economic problems associated with declining catch rates, quality, and fi  sh prices. 40

The  looming  crisis  of  the  fi  shing  industry  precipitated  the  bank crash  of  1894.  The  combination  of  faltering  catches  in  long-settled areas,  poor  prices  for  fi  sh,  and  the  concentration  of  St  John's  fi  rms on investment in the import and export business meant that they relied increasingly on the colony's commercial banks, the Union Bank, founded in 1854, and the Commercial Bank, founded in 1858. St John's firms and the banks had many of the same people on their boards of directors, so the banks were quick to lend money to the merchants without  worrying  too  much  about  the  security  of  their  loans.  The banks had neither diversifi  ed portfolios nor signifi  cant cash reserves. In the 1880s, a number of senior merchants retired to Britain and took a great deal of the funds of their fi  rms with them, further impoverishing the liquidity of both the exporting fi  rms and the local banks which facilitated the trade. As it became clear that the mercantile operations were immersed in a long-term problem of debt and shortage of cash,

the banks turned to the Newfoundland government's Savings Bank, the Reid family, British banks, customers' agents in England, and to funds raised through the sale of Newfoundland bonds to keep the financial system afl  oat. The Great Fire of St John's in 1892 destroyed a large part of the city and much capital, but created short-term liquidity as insurance payments and assistance fl  ooded the city. But between 1890 and 1894, a decline of fi  sh exports by more than 24 per cent, and a 6 per cent drop in fi  sh prices precipitated the fi  nal crisis. When a senior partner of the English fi  rm of Prowse, Hall and Morris died on 6 December 1894, that fi  rm decided to call for payment on bills drawn on it by the Commercial Bank. Lacking suffi  cient cash, the bank closed its doors. The Savings Bank, fearing a run, called in its loans to the Union Bank, forcing the latter to close. A number of prominent merchant firms, including E.J. Duder, Thorburn and Tessier, and John Munn and Company, did not survive the crisis. In the short term, the bank crash led to severe unemployment and retail profi  teering.

Unable to address the diffi  cult problems of the fi  shery, the Liberal government added to the looming fi  nancial crisis by its railway policies. The Whiteway government had awarded a contract to a Canadian syndicate dominated by the family of Robert G. Reid to fi  nish the Hall's Bay line for $15,600 per mile. Faced by another election in 1893, the Liberals had asked the Reids to construct the line from Hall's Bay to Port aux Basques. It raised a tariff on imports to provide revenue for the project and, hoping that railway-promoted economic growth would be worth it, borrowed the bulk of the money. In the short term, the tariff raised the cost of living for fi  shing families and deepened their dependence on credit or public relief for winter supplies. The depression in the fi  sh trade triggered by the bank crash aggravated the situation, forcing the government to borrow just when few had confi  dence  in  lending  money  to  Newfoundland  borrowers.  A.F. Goodridge, the premier of Newfoundland, unsuccessfully requested the fi  nancial assistance of Britain. The British government could not see how a short-term loan could solve such a systemic economic crisis. Imperial authorities may have been interested in seeing the colony fall into bankruptcy. Such an end would likely mean that the empire would serve as trustee and take control over a colony that had been since the 1830s a thorn in the imperial side on issues of treaty rights to the fi  shery, tariffs in foreign markets, and requests for subsidies for the industry.

The British refusal, and a related request for a royal commission investigation of the colony's affairs, led to the resignation of Goodridge

and the formation of a new government under D.J. Greene. Greene's government managed to borrow enough funds to reopen the Union Bank and guaranteed a return of 80 per cent on its notes. The government further guaranteed 20 per cent on notes issued by the Commercial Bank. In January 1895, reeling under the ongoing problems caused by the Great Fire, the poor in St John's demonstrated in anger at  the  government's  inadequate  action.  Charities  organized  by  the governor and his wife defused some discontent, but the government found itself again unsuccessfully asking for British assistance. Greene resigned, and Whiteway returned to power as premier.

Whiteway thought that union between Newfoundland and Canada might provide a solution to the fi  nancial crisis. As one of the Newfoundland delegates, along with Robert Bond and A.W. Harvey, to the Halifax Conference in 1892, Whiteway had decided not to pursue suggestions of union at the time. Beggared by its economic development policies, the Newfoundland government now agreed to a conference with Canadian offi  cials, held on 4 April 1895 in Ottawa. The Newfoundland delegates, including Robert Bond and E.P. Morris, felt that the Canadian government was unwilling to provide suffi  cient fi  nancial assistance, and the imperial government refused to provide additional  fi  nancial  support.  Acting  on  behalf  of  the  government, Robert Bond raised enough money in Montreal and London to keep the colony going, in part through personally guaranteeing the loan with his own money. The government reduced expenditures, and Canadian banks stepped into the void left by the Newfoundland institutions. 41 This gave stability but in the long run hurt the colony since the Canadian banks were less fl  exible when crafting credit arrangements to facilitate exports. Newfoundland now used the Canadian dollar as its currency yet had no infl  uence over exchange rates, which affected exports. Nonetheless, the failed negotiations with Canada left many in Newfoundland feeling bitter and pessimistic about what they could expect from closer relations with their Canadian neighbour.

The social and ideological crisis of the bank crash may have been as important as the economic and political crisis. Truck credit practices had caused fi  shing people to mistrust merchants, and this was worsened by the practice of tal qual . An inquiry into the crash in 1895 led to prominent merchants who sat on the banks' boards of directors, including Robert Thorburn, A.W. Harvey, Walter Baine Grieve, and William J.S. Donnolly, being charged in the Supreme Court with issuing false fi  nancial statements. While the case dragged on through 1897,  the  prosecution's  inability  to  determine  whether  or  not  over-

drafts in one instance might serve as assets in another allowed the merchants to avoid punishment. For the fi  rms that survived the crisis, business carried on as usual, although merchants tried to avoid extending credit to fi  shing people whenever possible. By the turn of the century, outport merchants wanted to get out of the fi  sh business by becoming more conventional retailers. 42

Forty years of responsible government had brought Newfoundland to a crisis. Frustrated by its lack of resources, and certain that little help could be expected from the empire, colonial authorities allowed the fi  shing industry to develop to the point of over-capacity, despite periodic demands from fi  shers that something be done to curb the problem of resource depletion. Merchants funded these problems by over-extending credit and engaging in ruinous competition with each other.  Newfoundland  governments  dabbled  with  regulations  and stock enhancement, but the multitudinous problems of the fi  sheries led most of them to embrace landward diversifi  cation, especially costly railway development. The railway was, ironically, part of a fi  rst nationalist fervour, as enthusiasts dreamed of a new industrial economy that, no matter how unrealistic the hope, would allow the colony to turn its back on the sea. Such commitment to landward diversifi  cation blinded many to the fi  nancial storm clouds that threatened to deluge the colony in ruin.

## Twilight of the National Policy, 1897-1908

Close to a half-century of responsible government had brought Newfoundland to a crisis, but the colony was about to enter what many would later see as its golden age. Although the Reformers and Liberals  who  had  fought  hard  for  responsible  government  had  promised economic wonders for the colony, it still depended for its life on the earnings derived from the sea. The fi  ght over confederation with Canada had reinforced nationalistic expectations about the potential of the colony's landward resources for economic development. The ignominy of the bank crash, in which Newfoundland had been bailed out by Canadian banks, had not dampened nationalist fervour as the colony approached the four hundredth anniversary of Cabot's 'discovery' of Newfoundland. Nationalist intellectuals remained convinced that a great destiny awaited Newfoundlanders. Having weathered the adversities of the past, such nationalists hoped they might look forward to the potential prosperity of the future, and many still placed their faith in a national policy of landward economic expansion. The limited achievements of the national policy, however, forced people to pay more attention to fi  sheries matters.

To  many  Newfoundlanders,  the  four  hundredth  anniversary  of John Cabot's voyage was an opportunity to put diffi  culties behind them and embrace what they hoped would be a more prosperous century. 'Cabot fever' swept St John's and merchants raised money to build a commemorative tower, the Cabot Tower, which altered the horizon of the capital city and remains a famous landmark to this day. More modest events accompanied the tower plans. St John's residents

held public debates, billiards tournaments, and public celebrations to honour Cabot and to celebrate Newfoundland. The Newfoundland government issued a postage stamp that proclaimed Cape Bonavista as 'the landfall of Cabot.'

For many, such as Roman Catholic Archbishop Michael Howley, Cabot's landfall  was  more  signifi  cant  than  just  being  an  important milestone in British imperial development. Howley, the fi  rst leader of  the  colony's  Roman  Catholics  to  be  Newfoundland-born  rather than Irish, was a member of St John's non-sectarian nationalist intelligentsia.  He  believed  Cabot  was  the  perfect  mythical  founder  of  a Newfoundland nation and could represent a Newfoundland that was greater than the sectarian political mess that at times it had seemed to be. A Catholic Italian who sailed in the service of an English monarch before the great breach with Rome, Cabot, as symbol, could draw together Irish Catholics and British Protestants in Newfoundland political culture. For the Liberal historian and Newfoundland booster D.W. Prowse, the celebration of Cabot's supposed discovery of Newfoundland made it no mere colony; it placed Newfoundland at the forefront of British imperial development and was an augury of great things to come in the island's development. 1

Although Cabot euphoria swept St John's, there continued to be good reasons to fear for Newfoundland's future. Robert Bond, Whiteway's colonial secretary, had little success in negotiating a new trade arrangement with the United States. Following the Fortune Bay dispute  (see  chapter  6),  the  American  government  had  abrogated  its trade  arrangements  with  Newfoundland  under  the  1871  Treaty  of Washington. In 1885, the colonial government had begun to negotiate a new arrangement with the United States but deferred to negotiations between imperial and American offi  cials in 1887. The ultimate failure of those negotiations led the British, in 1889, to allow the Newfoundland government to negotiate with the Americans. Bond negotiated directly with James G. Blaine, the American secretary of state. The two agreed that American vessels would be able to purchase bait and procure supplies and crews in Newfoundland, while Newfoundland fi  sh, fi  sh oil, and marine-mammal oils could enter the American market without paying duty.

The agreement, known as the Bond-Blaine Convention, drew criticism  from  the  Canadian  government,  which  expected  Newfoundland interests to play second fi  ddle to its own desire to use the British North American fi  sheries  as  a  bait  to  lure  the  United  States  into  a limited reciprocity agreement. The Canadian prime minister, Sir John

A.  Macdonald,  also  suspected  that  Blaine  was  anxious  to  promote American interests by dividing the British North Americans as much as possible. The British government vetoed the deal in 1891, much to the ire of many Newfoundlanders, and then tried to placate the Newfoundland government by lending it money for the railway, but Newfoundland retaliated against Canadian fi  shing vessels by enforcing its bait act against them. The Nova Scotia bank fi  shery began to suffer and Canada retaliated by imposing punitive tariffs on Newfoundland fish,  while  Newfoundland responded in kind by taxing imports of Canadian manufactures and foodstuffs. Premier Whiteway had been more inclined to compromise with Canadian and imperial offi  cials, but Bond, who had the majority support of the cabinet, forced the government to stand fi  rm. The status quo returned in 1892, when the British made clear that they would disallow discriminatory tariffs and that Newfoundland could not refuse Canadians access to bait. 2

Meanwhile, the Newfoundland government continued to ransom colonial resources in the pursuit of landward development. The bank crash led to the defeat of the Whiteway government in the election of 1897, despite their attempt to buy votes through awarding contracts for  branch-line  construction  to  the  Reid  syndicate.  The  opposition, now popularly referred to as the Tories, formed a government under the leadership of J.S. Winter and the minister of fi  nance A.B. Morine. Faced with massive fi  nancial obligations yet determined to proceed with railway development, Morine negotiated a deal that would hand over to the Reids much of the colony's new economic infrastructure outside of the fi  shery in exchange for completion of the railway. This deal, known as the Reid Railway Contract of 1898, provided the Reid Company with additional land grants of 5,000 acres per mile of railway operated. Robert Gillespie Reid would operate the railway for fifty years, after which it would become the property of his heirs in exchange for a payment of $1 million to the government and the return of 2,500 acres per mile of the original grant. Reid also purchased and agreed to operate the government dry dock in St John's and to build and operate a coastal steamer service on behalf of the government for a subsidy of just more than $91,000 a year. Reid assumed control of the ferry service linking Port aux Basques to North Sydney, the island's telegraph system, hydroelectrical rights for the supply of St John's, and colonial assistance to build a new railway station and surrounding street improvements in the west end of St John's. 3

The Tories believed that they had arranged for the Reids to carry the burden of railway development. Furthermore, the government felt that

the Reids would fund much of the future industrial diversifi  cation of the colony as they developed their land grants. The Liberals, now led by Robert Bond, who had become increasingly critical of Whiteway's policies in the dying days of the last administration, saw the contract as an unjustifi  able transfer of control over Newfoundland's economic destiny to a private monopoly. To make matters worse, that transfer had been negotiated by expatriate Canadians, especially Morine, who had been on the Reid payroll as the company's solicitor even while negotiating on behalf of the government.

Robert Bond successfully fought the 1900 election on the issue of the Reid contract, which he immediately set out to break, despite his colleague Edward Morris's support for the deal. Bond's fi  ght with the Reids was an early example of the electoral success a party leader might expect if he could portray himself as the defender of ordinary Newfoundlanders  against  big  outside  interests,  whether  industrial or government, or whether they were Canadian, British, or American.  Reid's  family  transferred  its  investments  to  the  newly  formed Reid Newfoundland Company and returned to the government the right to assume ownership of the railway (for $1 million plus interest) after fi  fty years of operation. As well, the Reids surrendered the lands given to them under the 1898 deal in exchange for $850,000, and Newfoundland acquired the right to resume control of the telegraph system. Otherwise, the provisions of the 1898 contract remained. The Reids retained control over much of the economy outside of the fi  shery, while the government assumed extra fi  nancial liabilities and the responsibility that went along with national control over future economic development. Bond wanted to limit the Reids, but they continued to have the quiet support of Morris, who represented the strong Roman  Catholic  constituency  of  St  John's.  Morris's  working-class constituents in the west end of the city stood to benefi  t by the Reids' proposal to move the railway's machine shops from Whitbourne to the city, and Bond could not afford to alienate this constituency. 4

There  were  other  events  that  indicated  that  Newfoundland  was achieving a more independent national status. One development was of  symbolic  and  lasting  signifi  cance.  In  1902,  Governor  Cavendish Boyle composed a four-verse poem, which was set to the music of Hubert Parry in 1904 and chosen by the Newfoundland government as the colony's offi  cial  anthem: the 'Ode to Newfoundland' (which continues to this day as the provincial anthem of Newfoundland and Labrador). More administrative in character was the Supreme Court's acquisition of jurisdiction over the vice admiralty court in 1890 and

exclusive  right  to  regulate  inferior  courts  in  1904.  Other  developments were more international in scope. Until 1904, colonial governments had failed in their attempts to undercut the French fi  shery on the French Shore through bait legislation and pressure on an unsympathetic Colonial Offi  ce (see chapter 6). Now, led by Prime Minster Whiteway's opponents from the old Reform Party (which had become the Patriotic Association), the anti-French public sentiment forced the government into a more public stance against the French fi  shery. Initially, the British government was so upset with the Newfoundland government's stand that it considered withholding fi  nancial  assistance for rebuilding St John's after the Great Fire to coerce the colony into  accepting  treaties  legislation  that  might  mollify  the  French.  In the end, the British provided Â£15,000 to assist people made homeless by the fi  re without such strings attached. But the rise of Germany as a military power had caused Britain and France to settle various irritants  between  the  two  countries,  including  the  French  Shore,  for the sake of their alliance. In 1904, the French agreed to give up their treaty rights to the French Shore in return for access to fi  sheries, bait, and ports in Newfoundland during the summer, but subject to Newfoundland law, and without the right to use the shore in their fi  sheries. The French retained a legal claim to rights on the French Shore until 1972, but the limits imposed by the 1904 agreement effectively ended its fi  sheries there. 5

Within St John's and the surrounding communities of the northeast Avalon Peninsula, the ignominy of the Bond-Blaine Convention, the  Cabot  celebrations,  the  public  fi  ght  against  the  Reids  and  their 'Canadian' henchmen, and the successful struggle against the French may have reinforced local economic nationalism. The city had undergone considerable economic change in the last quarter of the nineteenth century despite the shock of the bank crash. As Water Street merchants  decided  to  invest  outside  of  the  fi  sheries  to  avoid  such economic catastrophes in the future, they moved into manufacturing consumer goods. The notorious unpredictability of the fi  shing industry meant that credit-rating agencies (such as R.G. Dun and Company of New York) frowned on the efforts of local merchants to diversify. While such agencies were willing to forgive a merchant's occasional financial embarrassment due to a downturn in the fi  shery, seeing it as preferable to personal problems ranging from dishonesty to mental illness, they were reluctant to recommend that anyone invest in a new enterprise in the colony.

Local businessmen (women rarely participated in the businesses of

the elite except occasionally as the widows of businessmen) relied on family connections for capital; indeed, under merchant capital, an important way for a single businessman to raise funds was to marry well and gain the backing of a wealthy father-in-law. 6 There were opportunities for investment in activities related to the fi  shery. Prominent merchants Moses Monroe and Charles Bowring, along with Robert Thorburn, were major investors in the Colonial Cordage Company, which  manufactured  ropes,  lines,  and  twines.  Some  fi  sh  merchant firms, such as those of the Bowrings, Jobs, and Tessiers, also operated large cooperages that manufactured barrels for the fi  shing industry. Other merchants had invested in the dry dock.

Given the risks of the local environment, merchants who wished to diversify their investments turned to manufacturing. There had always been small-scale manufacturing of food such as baked goods, clothing, footwear, furniture, and other goods to satisfy the consumer needs of St John's. Merchant fi  rms had a long relationship with the craftspeople who made these goods, largely in providing their wholesale requirements and retailing some of their wares throughout the colony. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s there had been a rapid shift in mercantile investment from producer goods required by the chronically  troubled  fi  shery  to  consumer  goods.  Merchants  soon  found, however, that the stable demand for such goods in the colony was also inelastic and small, limited by the employment of the vast majority of the population in the fi  shery compared with the very small population of St John's who received their incomes in wages or salaries and lived by purchasing goods. Most consumer manufacturing found little demand in the fi  shing outports, where cash for purchasing was at a premium, thus providing a poor market for the production of capital goods. The clothing and baking industries, for example, were so small that it never made sense to produce sewing machines or ovens in the city instead of importing them. By the late 1890s, investment in manufacturing began to slow, although it continued through 1914. The development of the railway, as well as diversifi  cation in forestry and mining, provided some additional consumer demand. 7

The development of St John's manufacturing in the late nineteenth century led to the growth of an urban working class. Workers in the marine capital goods, consumer goods, and services industries organized unions and began to strike for higher wages, shorter hours, union recognition, and safer working conditions. These unions also opposed wage reductions and the use of non-union labour. In 1893, the St John's unions attempted to form a Workingmen's Union of Newfoundland

(WUN). This was to be a council of all trade unions which would act as a lobby group to remove legal impediments to unionization, fi  ght for higher wages, provide mutual benefi  ts, and promote government policies  to  encourage  St  John's  manufacturing  development.  The WUN did not last long, probably because of the economic instability associated with the 1894 bank crash. In 1897 the Mechanics' Society united all trade unions into one central body to pressure government for tariffs which would encourage manufacturing in the city. Collective bargaining was not on the Mechanics' Society agenda, and many of its members drifted away as the economy improved by 1900. 8

A much more successful working-class organization was the Longshoremen's Protective Union (LSPU), which organized workers in the port trades. Dockworkers, although indispensable to the economic life of the city, received poor pay for very irregular hours. Most worked by the day or hour, depending on the needs of shipping. To make matters more diffi  cult for those who tried to make a living on the docks, their  ranks  swelled  constantly  with  the  arrival  of  fi  shers  and  other rural  labourers during the off-season, or whenever a fi  shing vessel was laying over in port. The increasing metropolitan importance of St John's, enhanced by local manufacturing, railway, and dockyard development, provided a better base for the longshoremen's union. The shipment of perishable goods meant that shippers could not withstand long work stoppages, which the LSPU used to good effect. The variety of stevedores, fi  sh packers, barrowmen, cullers, stowers, and helpers who worked on the docks meant that workers needed a union that was not limited by a narrow craft or occupational base. In 1902 and 1903, work stoppages for higher wages resulted in the workers' foundation of the Steamboat Labourers' Union, which by 1904 had become the LSPU and represented all dock labour. The concentration of labour on the docks and employers' reluctance to face strikes meant that  the  LSPU  could  build  a  strong,  well-fi  nanced,  and  disciplined organization. Throughout the twentieth century the LSPU fl  ourished and was well known for the support it gave other workers who were trying to establish their own unions. 9

The growing dependence of manufacturing on differential protective tariffs  on  imports harnessed the St John's working class to the interests of local capitalists. A tariff of 5 per cent was placed on the imports of raw materials that manufacturers might require to produce goods. Finished goods such as boots and clothes were subject to a tariff of 10 per cent to protect local manufacturers from the competing imports of foreign industries. Such tariff protection also helped

governments to raise revenue for railway development, and the Bond government  further  encouraged  secondary  manufacturing  through subsidies, premiums, drawbacks, and tax exemptions. They reasoned that  if  Newfoundlanders  spent  most  of  their  money  on  imported goods, capital would continue to drain away from the colony, while the purchase of local goods would not only retain capital but would also generate much-needed employment outside of the fi  shery. The whole  strategy  was  premised  on  the  success  of  what  had  become Newfoundland's national policy: the railway would open up interior resources, such resources would prompt industrial development and the growth of a consumer market, and eventually domestic manufacturing would not require protection. 10

Much depended on the colonial government's ability to foster signifi  cant employment in industries other than the fi  shery. The industry which had given the colonial government the earliest hope had been mining. The Hall's Bay rail line had linked St John's with the mining district of Notre Dame Bay. C.F. Bennett had begun to operate a copper mine at nearby Tilt Cove in partnership with the prospector Smith McKay in 1864. The discovery of copper touched off a prospecting boom and a rush to fi  le mining claims between the 1880s and 1914. Prominent Liberals, such as Whiteway, invested in mines such as that at Little Bay. Robert Bond invested in a speculative asbestos enterprise on the Port au Port Peninsula. The close ties between the mine investors and the Liberals meant that they gave the industry a free hand. This reached its zenith in the Newfoundland Consolidated Copper Mining Company (NCCM), whose directors included William Whiteway. The company used its Liberal connections to dominate the copper industry of Notre Dame Bay. Largely unregulated by government, the NCCM skimmed the high-grade accessible copper ore, left other ore inaccessible in the tailings, and gave no thought to the longevity of the mines. The NCCM used truck to supply its employees, charging them high prices for food and maximizing profi  ts. When combined with speculative staking and sales of mineral rights, the high potential profi  t led to a boom in mining exploration.

In addition to serving as an important stimulus for railway expansion, the possibility of mineral discoveries on their land grants served as an important inducement for Reid investment in Newfoundland. The Reids operated iron, copper, and coal mines as well as granite quarries. They found most of the mines unprofi  table, which refl  ected the Newfoundland Geological Survey's overestimate of the colony's mineral resources. Despite the Reids' problems, there was still reason

to believe mining had a bright future. While the copper industry in Notre Dame Bay, as well as the pyrite mine at Pilley's Island, had begun to wind down in the 1890s and the last of the local mines at Tilt Cove closed in 1917, there was new interest in the iron ore of Bell Island, Conception Bay, close to St John's. The farming and fi  shing family of John and Jabez Butler, on whose land the ore lay, sold their rights to the land to the Nova Scotia Steel Company, which started a mine in 1894. In 1899, the mine became part of the holdings of the Whitney Company, which became known as the Dominion Iron and Steel Company. 11

The Newfoundland government expected more from forestry because of its efforts to foster agricultural settlement. The coastal forests backing outports had always provided fuel and material for the buildings, boats, and fi  sh fl  akes that people required. Crown Lands' Acts between 1844 and 1875 provided for the transfer of crown land to  private  property primarily for agricultural development, as well as for the development of sawmilling and railway expansion. In the last  quarter  of  the  nineteenth  century,  as  the  fi  shery  stagnated,  the colony had used bounties to encourage people to resettle to the bottoms of bays rather than emigrate from the colony. Some of the new communities developed substantial agrarian bases that allowed the withdrawal  of  effort  from  the  fi  sheries.  But  most  resettled  people found logging to be more important than farming, largely because soils still had to be supplemented with fertilizers from the sea. Outport people opened up forest land primarily to fi  nd material for the larger vessel construction required by expanding outer headland and Labrador fi  sheries. The mines in Notre Dame Bay created demand for lumber for construction and mine props. The potential of the forestry industry had been an important factor in the government's decision to change the route of the Hall's Bay rail line so that it angled toward the west coast of Newfoundland. 12

The Crown Lands and Timber Act of 1875 and the Crown Lands Act of 1884 had ended the indiscriminate and possibly illegal cutting on the French Shore. Otherwise, the Whiteway and Bond governments had let the lumber industry, which initially exploited almost exclusively white pine, develop almost unchecked. Although newspaper editors and correspondents occasionally expressed concern over resource  depletion,  the  boosters  of  railways  and  forest  industrialization kept up pressure to have all of the colony's resources surveyed and leased to developers. Within about thirty years, the commercial sawmilling industry had annihilated the pine stands of central New-

foundland, dried up the basis of the island's export trade in lumber, and disappeared. The government passed legislation in 1890 to foster  a  pulp  and  paper  industry  which  would  exploit  the  previously 'underutilized' soft woods. The Exploits, Gander, and Gambo rivers, along with the shores of Red Indian Lake, would likely be the site of the lumber and pulp industries. The government was excited about the prospect of growing Canadian timber shortages spurring on local industry by attracting more Canadian investors. It had hoped that development of the Reid railway would encourage even greater investment in forestry, and such hopes appeared to be fulfi  lled in 18991900.

The Newfoundland government had agreed upon an exchange of over 206 square miles of timber rights around Red Indian Lake between the Reids and Lewis H. Miller, from Crieff, Scotland. Miller built  a  large  sawmill  at  the  lake  and  constructed  a  branch  rail  line through to the coast. The new venture, Timber Estates Company, intended to mill white pine for export. Initially, the Reids hoped that Miller's would be the fi  rst of a number of forestry and other enterprises  that  would  create  traffi  c  for  their  railway.  Miller  found  that his timber rights did not include enough trees of lumber quality and that the land would not support the farms that promoters had hoped would be a by-product of cutting. 13

The exhaustion of commercial-quality pine led the Reids to turn their leases over to Alfred and Harold Harmsworth (British newspaper barons and later Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere) for pulp development. Premier Bond saw the Harmsworths' proposal for a pulp and paper complex as a symbolic justifi  cation of his economic nationalism. More immediately important, the industry would create muchneeded traffi  c for the railway, which had been operating at a defi  cit. Although the premier felt justifi  ed in limiting the Reid enterprise by the  renegotiation  of  the  1898  contract,  he  believed  that  the  railway was destined to be a powerful force for economic diversifi  cation and wanted to ensure that it was successful.

In 1903 Bond's government agreed to unprecedented concessions to the Harmsworths. In addition to the rights acquired from Miller, they received a ninety-nine-year lease for an undetermined section of land. The company chose land around Grand Lake, for which they had to pay only a reduced rent of two dollars per square mile. The Harmsworths had to pay the usual royalty of fi  fty cents per thousand board feet cut of lumber, but could cut pulp logs without any charge, and received all mineral and water as well as timber rights. The Brit-

ish capitalists had a choice of 10,000 acres outside their grants for mill and shipping facilities and could import any equipment and materials they needed duty-free. In return, the Harmsworths had to spend $20,000  in  three  years  and  pay  the  government  $1  million  within twenty years. By 1905, the Harmsworth operation had been incorporated as the Anglo-Newfoundland Development (AND) Company.

While Bond expected the public to be pleased, his political foes and St John's newspapers immediately attacked the deal. Those who were allied with the Reids argued that it was inconsistent for the premier to  have attacked the railway contract of 1898 as an egregious form of monopoly and then help establish a near-monopoly in the forest industry. Others, led by A.B. Morine, attacked the deal as a gift of the colony's resources to the AND Company with little in return. The AND contract passed through the legislature, and the company had a mill in operation at Grand Falls by 1909, but Bond was more cautious in his subsequent negotiations for the establishment of the A.E. Reed pulp company at Bishop's Falls. 14

The pulp and paper industry generated employment, but much of that was yet to come as St John's merchants invested in local manufacturing. While the forestry industry had shown some promise in diversifying the economy outside of St John's, the lumber industry had also demonstrated that the potential for resource exhaustion was great, and therefore the opportunities for signifi  cant long-term employment outside of the fi  shery were limited. Meanwhile, employment in mining was waning. Nonetheless, government support meant that merchants continued investing in local manufacturing, often with devastating effect on the smaller manufacturers who had long been a part of the St  John's  economy. Several small bakeries, for example, which had been producing ship's biscuit for the local fi  shing and shipping industries since the early years of the nineteenth century, could not withstand  the  competition  of  merchant-backed  factories  that  imported machinery and raw materials for mass production. The new factories found the old markets for baked goods too limited, and diversifi  ed into making soft breads, pastries, cakes, and confections for the local market. Small tailoring and boot- and shoemaking establishments similarly fell to merchant-owned factory production. The Jobs with their Royal Stores, for example, integrated their manufacturing with retail establishments. These merchants secured markets and squeezed out smaller producers by using a few of their own products and larger volumes of imported goods to undercut local tailors, dressmakers, and milliners with a greater variety of cheaper goods. Ownership and

control of local manufacturing concentrated as large fi  rms restricted credit in the fi  shery even more. 15

By 1910 there were signs the national policy of the Liberals was failing to live up to its promise. Railway development, mining, and forestry  had  failed  to  create  the  boom  in  population,  employment, and wealth for which many had hoped. Despite the disappointing results, the government had promoted these industries by selling for a pittance much of the colony's resources into the hands of mostly foreign-owned and -controlled corporations. There had been few positive developments in the fi  shery; indeed the crisis of credit in the aftermath of the bank crash had continued to trouble that industry. Moreover,  the  differential  tariff  had  made  life  more  expensive  for  fi  shing people, who were already antagonized by what they perceived as the infl  uence of Water Street merchants on government; but, rather than confront the problems of the fi  shery, the government invested most of its energy in economic diversifi  cation. The tariff structure cost fi  shers money and meant that the colonial economy had provided little opportunity for the profi  table development of backward linkages from the  fi  shing  industry.  Investment  in  producer  goods  for  the  fi  shery would perhaps have been productive, even this late in the day, but St John's manufacturers took advantage of the government's desire for diversifi  cation  to  gain  protection from foreign competition through investment in the manufacture of consumer goods. 16

The  economic  and  social  distinctions  between  St  John's  and  the outports grew. While working-class organizations episodically tried to deal with poor working conditions and wages, St John's workers remained  politically  tied  to  their  merchant-employers'  campaigns for even greater assistance for manufacturing. In the outports, on the other hand, many fi  shing people saw their cost of living rise as the colonial government protected local markets for industry. To make matters worse, outport people paid higher prices on the necessities of life that were produced by capital generated partially by St John's firms' restriction of credit in the fi  shery.

Emigration persisted as an integral part of life in rural Newfoundland. If the national policy did not succeed in the short term in stemming emigration, then the government tended to feel that the colony was only losing its most unskilled and underemployed people. Bond hoped that the national policy would trigger a new immigration of skilled  workers,  agriculturalists,  and  entrepreneurs  from  Britain  or northwestern Europe. The new immigrants would more than make up  for  those  who  left  Newfoundland  by  developing  the  resources

opened up in the interior by the railway. From the mid-nineteenth century, there had been a trickle of German, Norwegian, Dutch, and Danish immigrants, who came to work as merchants, ships' captains, medical professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs, particularly in mining and forestry. The colony became a home to smaller numbers of Chinese immigrants and refugees from among the persecuted minorities  of  Eastern  Europe,  such  as  Polish  Jews,  or  of  the  Ottoman Empire, such as Maronites, Druze, or Christian Syrians. These new immigrants became an important, if not particularly welcome, part of Newfoundland's society and economy. Jews from Russian territories, for example, usually young men, looked for business opportunities. Often fi  nding a cold shoulder among the business owners of St John's, many took up peddling by foot or on coastal boats throughout rural Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador. Jewish pedlars found outport  people  more  sympathetic  but  felt  that  the  residents  of  St John's appreciated their success and patronized the businesses many eventually opened in the city. Once established, Jewish immigrants sent for family members to join them in Newfoundland. Nevertheless,  increasing  immigration  amid  a  fairly  open-door  immigration policy meant that in 1906, fearing a fl  ood of non-Anglo-Americans, the Newfoundland government passed the Chinese Immigration Act and the Aliens Act. The fi  rst was especially repugnant, imposing a $300 head tax on each Chinese male immigrant, attempting to limit the colony's Chinese community to a total of two hundred people, and barring the entry of Chinese women. The Aliens Act allowed the government to deport immigrants who it felt were not supporting themselves properly. 17

While St  John's  had  many  of  the  trappings  of  a  colonial  capital, including  the  architectural  symbols  of  the  Colonial  Building  and Government House, the homes of the legislature and the governor respectively,  in  much  of  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  the  government was something with which people had infrequent contact. The government also provided few services to its citizens and relied upon merchants, clergy, and individual members of the Assembly to hand out public relief or employment in public works in rural districts. No area of the colony was as poorly served as Labrador. In the north, the Inuit were left to the Moravian missions to be regulated and administered. Rarely did the government have any contact directly with the Inuit  but  expected  the  Moravians  to  act  as  its  agents.  The  Moravians continued to foster more fi  xed settlement by their Inuit followers around the missions at Hopedale, Nain, Okak, and later at Hebron,

Zoar, Ramah, and Makkovik, using a form of truck trade in the Inuit's cod fi  sheries and sealing to support the missions. The Moravians used debt to discourage Inuit business with traders to the south, thinking they were protecting the Inuit from a more corrosive trade, unfettered by Christian principles.

The missionaries further emphasized the importance of education, creating a written form of Inuktitut. Although this written language allowed the Inuit to study scripture and engage in more formal education, it was a form of orthographic imperialism. The Moravians imposed a Greenlandic and Germanic language on the Labrador Inuit, without regard for their spoken grammar and usage. Many Inuit preferred to avoid economic and cultural dependence on the Moravians by retreating to the northern tip of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula. These northern Inuit were content to trade with the Moravians and other  traders,  such  as  the  Hudson's  Bay  Company  (HBC),  when  it was convenient but were unwilling to become dependent on them by taking up cod fi  shing or commercial sealing. 18

The Innu impinged upon the consciousness of St John's even less, despite the well-publicized exploits of the Hubbards. In 1903, Leonidas Hubbard, an editor with an American nature magazine, carried out an ill-fated expedition to what many American readers thought of as the exotic world of the Labrador interior. With his friend Dillon Wallace and guide George Elson, Leonidas Hubbard followed an inaccurate map, and they lost their way on the Susan River. Although Wallace and Elson survived, Hubbard perished. In 1905, Mina Hubbard, the wife of Leonidas, successfully completed the voyage he had planned. Her rivalry with Wallace, who had returned for a similar adventure, was well known, and Hubbard received much less public celebration in St John's than he did, likely because her successful leadership of an exploration party into the Labrador interior defi  ed contemporary bourgeois expectations about women as the weaker sex.

Nonetheless, Hubbard's diary and published account of her expedition provided much evidence about the Innu. Hubbard recorded signs of Innu occupation everywhere in the interior. She also met with Innu under tense circumstances. The Innu had yet to have a good hunt that year and had been concerned about the manner in which settlers from North West River, people of mixed European and Inuit ancestry, had been intruding on their trapping grounds. One of Hubbard's party, Gilbert Blake, was a settler. The occasional Roman Catholic priest or HBC trader was the Innu's principal contact with other cultures. The HBC had been making the Innu more dependent on the fur trade with

it  by  limiting  ammunition for their caribou hunt, a policy that had sometimes brought the Innu to the brink of famine. The Innu had begun to assert their sovereignty over the Labrador interior by protesting settlers' trapping and the Newfoundland government's granting of timber rights to lumber companies. 19

Perhaps  no  area  of  people's  lives  was  more  in  need  of  aid  than medical care. The dangerous occupations at sea and in the woods and chronic low incomes meant that malnutrition and the diseases that accompanied it were prevalent in areas such as the south coast of the island and coastal Labrador. As the Inuit settled in mission communities and became incorporated into the fi  shing economy, they no longer ate as much fresh meat and consumed much more fl  our and other European  staples.  The  resulting  poorer  nutrition  made  them  more susceptible to epidemics of such diseases as infl  uenza and endemic diseases such as tuberculosis. The Moravians gave the Inuit what little help they could, but the settlers and other residents of the southern coast were on their own. Into this vacuum stepped Wilfred Grenfell. An experienced physician who was motivated by the Christian ideal of working among the poor, Grenfell fi  rst visited Labrador in 1892 and found a widely dispersed population of impoverished people in desperate need of medical attention. Over the next few years he combined visits to the coast by sailing vessel and steamer with public speaking and book writing in England and the United States to raise money to support his medical mission. The government of the colony was happy to have Grenfell treat the ill and raise money to build hospitals at St Anthony on the island and in several coastal communities such as at Battle Harbour, but were less happy with Grenfell's descriptions of northern poverty when they were trying to present the image of the colony as a prosperous and progressive place in which to invest. He recognized that medical care was a palliative that did not address the root causes of hardship and condemned the nature of merchant-client relations as being responsible for people's low incomes. On Grenfell's initiative several cooperatives were formed to give people an alternative to merchant credit, and a series of craft industries were begun to give people sources of income other than the fi  shery. Although often paternalistic in his messages, Grenfell and his Mission provided Labrador with a high-profi  le representation throughout North America that was diffi  cult for the Newfoundland government to ignore. 20

Small-scale handicraft production helped pay for the operation of the hospitals, but it could not compensate for the long-term decline in fi  sh landings. The fi  shery had continued to languish as merchants

withdrew capital from it, and colonial governments began to borrow heavily from foreign capital markets to fund economic diversifi  cation. The national policy itself  burdened  the  fi  shery.  Government  tariffs raised the costs of the industry, while the appearance of new forms of employment on the railway and in forestry provided fi  shing people with alternate sources of income. Such income probably freed fi  shers from dependence on the credit of any particular merchant. In the context of the long-term restriction of credit in the trade, this meant that fi  shers were free to look for the best credit terms available. Merchants could not count on the dependence of their clients in a trade already risky due to such diverse problems as localized stock depletion, weather, international  currency  exchange,  and  market  fl  uctuations. While smaller outport merchants had little choice but to continue extending credit in exchange for fi  sh and other products such as cod oil, at least to the most dependable of their clients, the St John's fi  rms had decided  that  investing  in  the  fi  shery  through  extending  additional credit was too unstable and risky. But as long as the vast majority of the population lived by fi  shing, merchants had no choice but to be involved in the complex credit and debt relations of the trade.

By the end of the nineteenth century, however, many fi  rms could see the advantage of wholesaling and retailing in the cash markets of St John's and had high hopes for the development of similar markets in the industrial enclaves of forestry and mining. In the short term, merchants saw little point in investing a lot of money or time to reform the fi  shery. The fi  sh trade was a highly competitive business to be squeezed ruthlessly to obtain profi  t that might then be invested in other sectors of the economy, or consumed as the personal wealth of the  grand families of Water Street. 21 Under such circumstances, investing in a new industrial sector such as mining seemed more secure. Not only did investment in such an area seem to promise a way out of the troubled fi  shery, but there were also numerous American companies willing to provide capital to fund prospecting. Before 1908 no more than a few thousand people were ever employed in mining, but there were enough families enjoying the benefi  ts of steadier employment and higher incomes than could be found in the fi  shery to pressure government for more. American capital also entered the forestry sector.

Until the 1880s, St John's merchants had provided most of the capital and ownership of the colony's shipping fl  eet. While merchants favoured the small schooners in the fi  shery and coastal shipping trade, by the 1860s they had also invested in the larger sailing vessels of the

ocean-going trades. Declining earnings in the fi  shery meant that most merchants withdrew capital from the shipping industry through the 1880s. A small number of St John's and Conception Bay merchants increased their investment in shipping, particularly steam-driven vessels that were built outside the colony, and extended control over a greater portion of the colony's shipping fl  eet. Steamers had proven much more productive in the seal hunt, but the higher overhead costs of  steamers meant that very few fi  rms could afford them. The seal hunt was subject to many of the same uncertainties as the cod fi  shery, and owners would be hard pressed to fi  nd profi  table uses for the steamers once the sealing season ended.

The pattern of investment in the seal hunt suggests an underlying weakness in this economic development. Firms tended to invest more in steamers after a particularly good hunt. The intensifying depletion of seals meant, however, that the best seasons increasingly went to those who employed steamers because these vessels were far more mobile in the pack ice and could better hunt for increasingly hardto-fi  nd herds. By the early years of the twentieth century it became apparent that seal herds were in such bad shape that even the investment in steamers could no longer be justifi  ed. Over the long term, the cycle of investment and resource depletion encouraged merchants to withdraw capital from the fi  shery and landward investments. 22

The merchants who invested in the seal hunt tried to offset declining rates of return by squeezing more out of their labour by using the share system of payments, a divisive system that pitted sealers against each other, and a variety of means such as 'berth' fees and charging sealers for their equipment. Nonetheless, time spent working  together  and  living  under  harsh  and  dangerous  conditions  encouraged sealers to see that they had much in common, leading to collective action, such as a brief sealers strike in 1902. In that year, 211 sealers of the SS Ranger , a wooden-hulled steamer, left their vessel in St John's to protest their wages and sparked a wider strike by sealers from other vessels. Paid only by shares, the sealers had witnessed the steady deterioration in their earnings throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Vessel owners made extra money, besides the sale of seal oil and hides, by charging the sealers for coal to fuel the vessels and for cleaning the vessels after the hunt. The sealers continued to purchase all the equipment they required for the hunt in truck from the vessel's owners. On 8 March 1902, the international price for seal oil had dropped so low that the sealers could not see how going to the ice would be worth all these charges. Merchants were

offering only $2.40 for every 112 pounds of seal fat while the strikers wanted $4.00 to $5.00. Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle met the strikers and suggested they consider a compromise price of $3.25. The men of  each ship agreed and chose a delegate from each vessel to meet with the owners, enlisting the representation of A.B. Morine. But the merchant fi  rms - Baine, Johnston, Job's, and Bowring's - would only commit to looking into the matter. By 10 March it was clear the owners would make no concessions. Sympathetic residents of St John's took the strikers, most of whom had made their own way into the capital  from  communities on the northeast coast, into their homes. When some of the sealers broke ranks to return to their ships, the strikers  formed  a  vigilance  committee  to  prevent  them  from  doing so. The owners requested the governor provide armed protection for sealers who wished to return to work, while the sealers, with Morine, asked for Premier Bond's assistance. The strikers stood fi  rm in a demand of $4.00 per 112 pounds. An offer of $3.50 tempted many of the strikers to return to their ships. A crowd of angry sealers rushed to the wharves to prevent this return and were joined by local supporters among the townspeople. An appeal from Morine, and an assurance that Bond would back the settlement, led the strikers to return to their ships. 23

Although an important part of the rural economy of the northeast coast, the seal hunt did not completely transform rural independent fishermen into part of a working class even though it was a harsh experience with the exploitation of capitalism. Sealing remained something resorted to for a few weeks out of the year by young men who were part of families working in fi  shing households for the rest of the year. The share system in the industry tended to lead to extreme competitiveness between the crews of different vessels, and even among the crews of individual vessels. While shares continued to dominate the payment of wages, employment levels dropped. Working conditions became more proletarian, but the work became a much more urban, St John's, phenomenon throughout the early twentieth century. 24

The resource depletion and class confl  ict within the sealing industry in the early years of the twentieth century reveal the limited nature of the investment opportunities for merchant capital in the marine-resource sector of Newfoundland and Labrador. Merchants tried to utilize the unused capacity by employing their steamers to carry fi  shers to the Labrador coast in the summer and carrying salt cod to markets at the end of the fi  shing season. Unfortunately the large freight capacity and speed of the steamers encouraged greater competition be-

tween merchant fi  rms and led to even more glutted markets and low fish prices. The resulting persistent drop in fi  sh prices in turn undermined the bank fi  shery, the other major area of merchant investment, despite the subsidies provided by the Newfoundland government. By the early twentieth century, the bank fi  shery was a small part of the overall industry, although it was very important to the communities of the south coast of Newfoundland. 25

Aware of the various problems that characterized the Newfoundland cod fi  shery, a number of fi  sh merchants looked to the Americans for possible alternatives for the industry. In particular, the merchants of Gloucester, Massachusetts, had been turning more to the sale of cod in the domestic market to escape the same limits of low international prices. The fi  shing industry of Gloucester successfully defended protection of the American market for fi  sh from competing imports and could rely on the railway transportation network radiating out from Boston to permit effi  cient marketing. The domestic market allowed the Gloucester industry to invest in new processing and packaging techniques to provide a high-quality, value-added product. Gloucester investors could afford to equip their banking schooners with auxiliary engines. All of these innovations were well known in Newfoundland, since Gloucester schooners came every year to acquire bait and ice from Newfoundland suppliers.

Merchants from St John's with ties to those in such south-coast centres as Burin, Fortune, Grand Bank, and St Lawrence, as well as local firms from those communities, considered the feasibility of adopting similar innovations as the Americans'. Unlike the Americans, these Newfoundland fi  rms could not rely on a large, protected domestic market for fi  sh to make the investment worthwhile. The St John's fi  rm Bowring Brothers Ltd. had experimented with the introduction of a steam trawler in 1901-2 but found that it was too costly to operate in the absence of a nearby market for fresh fi  sh. Although the Bond government had hoped that the combination of the railway, a good ferry service to the mainland, and cold-storage technology would allow Newfoundland-caught fi  sh to be shipped to mainland markets, the cold-storage methods of the day were not adequate to facilitate the shipment of fresh fi  sh over such long distances. The introduction of auxiliary engines gave American schooners an advantage in pursuing pelagic species such as herring and mackerel. Unable to justify the expense of such engines due to the poor returns of the international cod fi  shery, Newfoundland bank fi  shers could not break into these subsidiary fi  sheries, which, like the American cod fi  shery, en-

joyed protected markets. Throughout the fi  rst decade of the twentieth century a number of merchant fi  rms attempted to produce new fi  sh products, from scotch-cured herring to a form of canned cod with the ill-advised name of 'fi  sh cheese.' None of these operations were able to break into the American market. 26

Without more lucrative markets for fi  sh products, few merchants were willing to combine to take control over marketing in the colony's established salt-fi  sh markets. Occasionally merchants would form an association, such as the Fish Exporters' Association of 1900, but Water Street's culture of competition meant that one or more fi  rms usually broke ranks to try to get a better price. In this case, Bowring's broke away from an agreement to fi  x prices in the Brazilian market. Premier Bond attempted to improve the position of Newfoundland fish in the American market. The premier had come under increasing political pressure from the colonial press to do something to stem the tide of emigration to the United States. In 1902 Bond began this process anew through the negotiation of the Bond-Hay Treaty. This treaty would have allowed American fi  shers the right to purchase bait in  Newfoundland on the same terms as Newfoundlanders, as well as the right to trade in colonial ports. The duties on many American imports would be removed or reduced, while Newfoundland would gain free access to the American market for metal ores and all fi  sh products except fresh or unsalted cod. The last provision left many Newfoundlanders wondering if the treaty was worth much, but saltfish exporters thought that the American markets for salt fi  sh were good enough to justify it. Unfortunately for Bond, Gloucester fi  shing interests managed to stall American approval of the Bond-Hay Treaty. The American Senate's delay of the treaty led the Bond government to take retaliatory measures against the American fi  shery at Newfoundland, but to little effect. American vessels could no longer be licensed to purchase bait and supplies in Newfoundland, and the Americans were excluded from the winter herring fi  shery of the Bay of Islands based on a particular construction of the Convention of 1818 that argued that Americans did not have a right to fi  sh off coasts inside the headlands of Newfoundland's major bays. The government's actions angered the American and British governments as well as the many Newfoundland fi  shers who depended on employment on American ships  or  on  sales  of  bait  to  the  Americans.  The  British  and  Americans eventually worked out a compromise that restored most of the Americans' fi  shing rights. Bond's government was embarrassed, and his party split on the issue.

## 174 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

Bond had other diffi  culties. The ambitious E.P. Morris left the government on a pretext and founded the People's Party. The People's Party supported amicable relations with the United States and hoped for an infusion of American capital to reinvigorate the national policy. Morris spoke much about Bond's futile efforts to develop markets while jeopardizing possible sources of investment in new manufacturing enterprises that would allow more Newfoundlanders to stay at home. Morris, a man who was comfortable rubbing shoulders with his working-class constituents, made much about being a man of the people, while portraying Bond as aloof and arrogant, a patrician who had little sympathy with the sealers during their strike. While Morris claimed to be interested in fi  sheries development, it was clear that his real interest lay in promoting the Reid enterprises and the national policy generally. The People's Party's development policies were not all that different from the Liberals', except in Morris's support for the Reids.

By 1908, it was apparent that the movement to secure better markets for fi  sh products in the United States had failed. Without new market opportunities, merchants remained mired in their old marketing habits and continued their long-standing practice of withdrawing capital from the fi  shery. 27 It  was  also  clear  that  marine-resource  industries offered little room for additional investment in the manner to which merchants were accustomed. As the seal hunt had demonstrated, investment in more capital-intensive technologies quickly exacerbated the ongoing problems of resource depletion, which were already evident in the cod fi  sheries. Although the initial experience of railway development might have suggested to colonial governments that the alternative - landward diversifi  cation - was fraught with diffi  culties, they felt that there were few options. The twentieth century had begun with resurgent local nationalism, and the spectacular apparent success of establishing an interior pulp and paper industry, despite major concessions to foreign capitalists, offered hope for the future. In St John's, railway development and protective tariffs prompted local manufacturing, but at the expense of outport people's quality of living. The industrial constituencies of the city became a powerful political force, which an astute politician like Morris discovered might be mobilized by patronage, especially through further railway development. Few people thought much about taking new approaches to the better use of the mainstay of the colony, its marine resources. While many were inclined  to  view  the  Newfoundland  national  policy  as

progressive and forward looking, occasional voices would demand that the colony pay more attention to the better management of its fisheries. One such voice was that of William Coaker of the Fishermen's Protective Union.

## The Politics of Hope and Demoralization, 1908-1934

Morris's People's Party, which came to power in 1909, continued the free fall into debt that began with the Liberals' landward economic diversifi  cation policies. Regardless of partisanship, the colony's political and economic elites developed no effective policies to address the problems of the fi  shery. New working-class movements periodically offered opportunities to redefi  ne priorities for Newfoundland, but they fell apart because of the structural problems of mining and forestry or because of their dependence on the protectionism and investment of St John's merchants. The appearance of the Fishermen's Protective Union (FPU) initially seemed to promise reform but foundered on the political goals and personal inclinations of its leader, William Ford Coaker.

The FPU originated in the contraction of merchant credit that followed  the  bank  crash  of  1894.  Fishers  without  credit  had  to  work on shares for those who did, especially those who owned cod traps and the larger skiffs required to operate them. Successful trap owners, called trap skippers, could afford motors for their boats, allowing them to go further to set their traps. Most skippers and their employees were related; community and family considerations rather than the  market  governed  skippers'  relationships  with  servants,  and  all depended on merchants' credit. Merchants recognized that cod traps, and later motor boats used to tend them, served as adequate collateral that could be seized in case clients defaulted on their debts. Class differences emerged among fi  shers when some skippers began to act more as merchants themselves. Such skippers and planters in the Lab-

rador fi  shery used truck practices to supply their servants with equipment and provisions. Community identifi  cation continued to tie trap skippers and their crews together, particularly as it became clear that it  was  the  merchants of Water Street who cut credit. As such, trap skippers emerged as important, if paternalistic, leaders of their fi  shing communities. 1

The fi  shery continued to be the economic mainstay of the island, making the restriction of credit all the more troubling. On the northeast coast, mining had declined, leaving people dependent on locally depleted cod stocks, reduced seal herds, and a steamer-based industry concentrated in St John's. The southern shore of Conception Bay, like most of the fi  shing communities of the northeastern Avalon Peninsula and its southern shore, benefi  ted from the growth of St John's. People found work in the city's new industrial enterprises, and its growing population created a market for a variety of marginal agricultural surpluses and fresh fi  sh. The opportunities for such employment were limited; despite all of the effort directed at economic diversifi  cation, six out of every ten people who worked in the colony were still fi  shers, and many others worked in the preparation and handling of fi  sh products. The fi  shery dominated economic life from Ferryland south and west across St Mary's, Placentia, and Fortune bays. Merchants continued to invest in the bank fi  shery, which helped to maintain the total volume of fi  sh exports of the colony. Working conditions were terrible in the bank fi  shery, but merchants used a combination of fi  xed wages and shares to encourage rivalry among the schooner crews and paternalistic ties with schooner masters. 2

Discontent in these fi  sheries was never the same as on the northeast and west coasts, where credit restriction had eroded paternalistic truck practices. The slump during the 1907-8 exporting season was particularly severe partially because, although there had been a good fish  catch,  merchants'  usual  rush  of  salt  fi  sh  to  market  produced  a glut and a slump in prices. Merchants cut in half the price they had offered for fi  sh the year before, threatening even trap owners. Trap skippers responded by taking a leading role in the formation of the FPU. By 1908, the FPU in turn mobilized the many more fi  shers who were brought together in the Labrador fl  oater fi  shery and seal hunt, harsh work which fostered solidarity among the crews. The stationer fishery at Labrador, which had closely tied together families on the southern Labrador coast with those of the south shore of Conception Bay, had also been hit hard by the poor season of 1907-8. The fl  oater fishery, however, drew fi  shers together in a more collective enterprise,

unlike the household character of production among the stationers. The nature of work in the fl  oater fi  shery and the seal hunt, combined with the leading role played by trap skippers in their home communities, provided a strong base for the FPU in communities such as Port de Grave, Bay de Verde, Trinity, Bonavista, Fogo, and Twillingate. Bank fi  shers provided little support for the FPU, favouring the denominational and fraternal organizations such as the Star of the Sea Association, the Society of United Fishermen, the Orange Lodge, and the Masonic Lodge. 3

William Ford Coaker gave the FPU much of its specifi  c character. Coaker was not from a fi  shing community; he had been born in St John's in 1871. As a boy, Coaker had quit school to work with other boys as fi  sh  handlers for Water Street merchants. Treated as cheap and casual labour, fi  sh handlers worked hard for little pay. Coaker's response was to organize a successful strike in 1884 for better pay. Coaker may have absorbed some of the unionist views of other workers on the St John's waterfront; he later claimed to be familiar with elements of socialist thought. Coaker's values could be attributed to his Anglican upbringing to some degree; at heart he believed in the right of  every  individual  to  participate  equally  in  the  pursuit  of  wealth. Hard work, honesty, a commitment to fair play, and a sense of duty should be enough for personal success. Coaker went on to manage a fi  sh cannery and eventually set up as an independent shopkeeper in Notre Dame Bay. After his small business failed during the bank crash, he began to farm near the small community of Herring Neck and fi  shed on the side. A supporter of Bond, he received patronage appointments as a telegrapher and chair of the local road board in 1897 but lost both positions when the Tories came to power.

Coaker  viewed  merchants  as  ruthless  exploiters.  Sympathetic  to the hardships of his neighbouring fi  shers and their families, he saw his own problems as part of theirs. Merchants, furthermore, were St John's people who used their infl  uence over government to control Newfoundland  and  Labrador  for  their  own  interests,  while  venal city politicians courted self-interested city voters to the detriment of outport  people.  In  1903,  Coaker  organized  a  union  of  telegraphers and established a small newspaper that focused on the fi  sheries. His editorials  addressed  the  plight  faced  by  fi  shermen,  whom  he  saw as a hard-working, God-fearing, and dutiful lot, the heart and soul of  Newfoundland society. Given a fair chance, such fi  shers should have been able to earn good livings, but the power of merchants and their government lackeys meant fi  shermen never had a fair chance.

Between 1903 and 1908, Coaker conceived of an organization of fi  shermen that would counteract the infl  uence of big merchants and indifferent governments in St John's: the FPU.

The FPU's basic philosophy bore the stamp of Coaker's individualism and incipient populism: fi  shermen should be independent, each having the right to accumulate the wealth from his labour. Embodied in the motto of the FPU, 'to each his own,' the ethic of Coaker's FPU was directed at merchants' use of credit to exploit the hard work of fishers. The FPU was primarily a cooperative of inshore fi  shing people that attempted to eliminate merchants as brokers in the marketing of fi  sh. While a collective enterprise, the FPU's goals were nonetheless individualistic.

In  1909  the  FPU  held  a  founding  convention  that  organized  the union  much  like  the  Orange  Lodge,  the  fi  rst  democratic  organization many fi  shers had experienced. The FPU's constitution allowed any male fi  sher, farmer, logger, or manual labourer to join a local in their community. Each local would then elect representatives to district councils that, in turn, would elect representatives to a supreme governing  council.  The  annual  conventions  of  the  FPU  elected  its president, with Coaker being acclaimed in the position at the fi  rst convention. In the same year, Coaker established an FPU newspaper, the Fishermen's Advocate ,  to  voice  fi  shers'  concerns,  offer  solutions,  and politically educate their neighbours. 4

While occasionally interested  in  the  organization  of  fi  sh  production, the FPU spent much of its energy on giving fi  shers more control over the conditions under which they sold fi  sh. The FPU wanted to see more government involvement in an impartial inspection and grading of fi  sh  quality,  rather  than  leaving  it  in  the  hands  of  merchant-employed cullers. The union further criticized tal qual as a disincentive to the production of good-quality fi  sh. Most importantly, the FPU wanted fi  shers to control the marketing of fi  sh.

Initially, Coaker suggested that fi  shers should organize a loan fund through the FPU so that they could purchase supplies without having to rely on merchants' credit. Coaker put his ideas into operation by establishing the FPU's own mercantile enterprise in St John's: the Union Trading Company (UTC). By using bulk buying, the UTC would be able to supply goods at prices below those offered by merchants and therefore break their prices. The allegiance of the membership of the FPU to the UTC was impressive; by 1919 it was a successful mercantile venture whose earnings funded much of the work of the FPU. While the UTC successfully competed with merchants, it did not pre-

cipitate reform of the fi  shery. The FPU's other business enterprises, the Union Electric Company and a shipyard, show the extent to which the Union mobilized fi  shing people's dues to build a business empire. It was headquartered in its own town, Port Union, which boasted union-owned bungalows for workers, a department store with an elevator, and a movie theatre. 5

Coaker felt that the FPU must organize politically to reform the fi  shery. Merchants had recently organized in a Board of Trade through the  efforts  of  William  G.  Gosling  to  develop  markets,  regulate  fi  sh quality,  support  fi  sheries  research,  and  lobby  government  on  fi  sheries policy. Gosling's efforts had the sympathy of E.P. Morris; the People's Party platform called for market development, cold storage facilities, steam transportation of fi  sh to markets, bait facilities, fi  sheries diversifi  cation, and a ban on steamers in the Labrador fi  shery. By supporting the Board of Trade, Morris looked dynamic in comparison with Bond, who was still fl  ailing about on the issue of better access to the American market. While leading merchants supported the board, they only supported a voluntary inspection for salt fi  sh and preferred to blame fi  shers' supposed illiteracy and conservatism for the persistence of poor quality. The FPU, by contrast, wanted government control of a mandatory inspection process that would be free of mercantile infl  uence. 6

Initially,  Morris's  rhetoric  of  being  the  working man's friend appealed to Coaker, as did the People's Party's pro-development policies. The split between Bond and Morris over the issue of access to American markets for Newfoundland products had been a further attraction. The People's Party's development platform, while mostly consisting of plans stolen from the Liberals, antagonized Water Street merchants, who favoured Bond's attempt to gain freer access to the American market and who rejected the Reid railway plan as too ambitious. Morris, on the other hand, continued to support the railway as essential for diversifi  cation and had the support of many of Newfoundland's smaller businesspeople, especially newer outport merchants, journalists, and professionals who felt that the expansion of outport branch lines would assist in the development of new industries throughout the entire colony.

In  his  struggle  with  Bond  during  the  general  election  of  1908, Morris had angled for the support of fi  shing people and the FPU by promising  better  fi  sheries  reform  and  an  old-age  pension  scheme. However, Morris's failure to establish government-controlled, mandatory  regulation  of  salt-fi  sh  marketing  and  his  refusal  to  enforce

regulations against commercial cutting on a three-mile-deep strip of coastal forests reserved for use in the fi  shery alienated Coaker and the FPU. Through 1911, Morris continued to fi  sh for FPU support, using the bait of a limited number of pensions worth $50 per year available only to men over the age of 75. Morris eventually proposed to allow an additional four hundred pensions in 1912 in a further bid to live up to an FPU call for a more generous provision of $100 per year to men over the age of 70. While Bond criticized the expense of Morris's plan, no one, including the FPU, criticized the manner in which it excluded women, who did so much of the processing of catches into salt fi  sh. 7

Coaker concluded that  none  of  the  St  John's-based  parties  were likely  to  represent  the  interests  of  fi  shing  people  adequately.  The People's Party represented city capitalists, not fi  shing people, sealers, and loggers. The Liberals' old association with the encouragement of manufacturing through tariff protection meant that they were largely a party of the city, not of the outports. St John's newspapers and the city's workers benefi  ted from manufacturing, which pitted them both against the anti-protectionist stance of the FPU. The FPU's loose ties to the Orange Order on the northeast coast and its progressivism drew the ire of Roman Catholic Archbishop Howley, who encouraged opposition to the union.

Without  much  support  among  the  bank  fi  shermen  of  the  south coast, the FPU was a regional movement. The way to gain infl  uence over colonial policy, Coaker thought, lay in the same balance-of-power strategy that Morris had previously used with Bond. The FPU should form a political wing that would form alliances with whichever party was willing to promote the rights of fi  shing people, as articulated in the political platform of the FPU. The Union Party had an excellent chance of controlling the fourteen seats in the House of Assembly for the northeast coast. In a House of thirty-six seats, such control was critical in the balance of power but insuffi  cient to allow one party to form a government.

The full political program of the FPU shook the foundations of party politics in Newfoundland. It demanded that government provide free and compulsory education in non-denominational schools. In the outports, night schools should be made available to people who could not attend during the day because of their work. Local fi  shing people should elect people from their own communities to run school boards, but these boards should not be controlled by appointees of the church establishment in St John's. Sectarian politics should also be removed from the composition of the road boards that provided able-bodied

relief. People in the outports should elect the boards rather than rely on the patronage of St John's politicians. Further, the FPU advocated confl  ict-of-interest legislation and the use of referenda, both to ensure that the government in St John's remained responsive to the people and to limit its corrupt practices. Finally, they required government to bring in universal old-age pensions and develop a program of rural hospital construction.

Such a platform clearly threatened the autonomy and power of merchants and industrialists in the economy. The union wanted import tariffs adjusted so that outport people could have access to cheaper imported goods, a direct threat to the factory owners and workers of St  John's.  They  wanted  the  government  to  legislate  better  working conditions and wages in the seal hunt and logging, and, most threatening of all, they desired that the state take control of the marketing of  salt  fi  sh  to  end  the  ruinous,  competitive  marketing  habits  of  the colony's major exporting fi  rms. The FPU demanded that the government guarantee the quality of its fi  sh products to foreign consumers by abolishing tal qual , by legislating a standardized fi  sh cull, and by appointing government cullers and inspectors. Newfoundland must further  appoint  overseas  trade  commissioners  to  take  more  direct responsibility for the promotion of Newfoundland products in foreign markets rather than rely on British offi  cials or agents of private companies to do so. While concentrating on fi  sh marketing, the FPU was also interested in the conservation of fi  sh stocks and wanted the government to reorganize, and provide more fi  nancial support for, a professional fi  sheries department.

Having parted ways with Morris, Coaker approached Sir Robert Bond about the possibility of a Liberal-FPU political alliance. In 1911 Coaker proposed that any FPU MHAs elected in the next general election would support a government led by Bond, as long as it agreed to fi  sheries reform. Ever the patrician, and an ally of Bishop Howley, Bond refused, arguing that he could not allow a specifi  c interest group to 'coerce' legislation from the Assembly, although governments had acted  on  behalf  of  railway  owners,  manufacturers,  merchants,  and bishops in the past. Coaker organized a mass demonstration by sealers in St John's in March 1912, but neither Bond nor Morris would bargain with the FPU. Morris, feeling cocky because of the better condition of the economy, openly attacked Coaker, as did Morris's allies in the Roman Catholic press. Coaker turned to organizing fi  shers in crucial Liberal districts such as Twillingate, which provided Bond's own seat, Bonavista, Trinity, and Fogo. Having lost a seat in a by-

election the previous year, the Liberals' political fortunes looked bad indeed.  Under  pressure  from  his  northeast-coast  supporters  in  the House, Bond accepted an alliance with the FPU.

Although Bond had supported landward development, he feared the growing public debt and despised Morris's use of railway branchline contracts to buy votes. He insisted that the Liberals could only enter  the  next  election  on  a  platform  of  government  retrenchment. The Liberal-Union alliance, as it became known, survived only because of Bond's promise to attempt some of the reforms demanded by the FPU's own platform and because of the efforts of more cooperative leading Liberals such as James M. Kent and W.F. Lloyd. At fi  rst glance, the result of the alliance in the 1913 general election was unimpressive. The Liberal-Unionists managed to gain only fi  fteen of the House's thirty-six seats, and Morris's hold on power remained secure. The FPU's Union Party, however, had fi  elded nine candidates. Eight of these won their electoral battles, and the other, Nathan Barrett, lost by only nine votes to People's Party candidate John C. Crosbie in the district of Bay de Verde. The six Liberals elected in northeast-coast districts,  including  Bond,  succeeded  because  the  FPU  had  not  run candidates against them. Thus, while the Liberals depended on the Union Party for electoral support, the Union Party depended on the Liberals for legislative experience and support in St John's.

Unable to accept his political dependence on a party of fi  shermen, Bond resigned his seat and retreated to his estate at Whitbourne to launch bitter attacks against the FPU. The leadership of the alliance was assumed by J.M. Kent, while Morris's political fortunes began to change for the worse. His St John's constituents consisted largely of the Reid enterprises and all those workers who depended on the railway and its related enterprises for their livelihoods. Morris's use of branch-line construction to establish a broad base of support outside the city had begun to alienate the merchants of Water Street, who feared mounting public debt and higher taxes. Soon after the election in 1913, with the support of Water Street slipping away, Morris again courted the FPU. His government passed toothless legislation to prevent price fi  xing in the fi  shery by merchant combines, to create and expand a Workmen's Compensation Act to cover sealers, and to establish better working conditions for sealers. Morris agreed to a joint Union Party-Board of Trade call for a royal commission to investigate conditions in the fi  shery but faced stiff opposition within the Legislative Council, where the infl  uence of the St John's merchants remained strongest. Morris provided no effective enforcement for his fi  sheries

initiatives and refused to implement the fi  sheries commission's call for government regulation of quality standards, culling, and inspection. In consequence, the premier had little chance for support from the Union Party. 8

While the government's economic policies benefi  ted the St John's area, the life of outport people continued to be diffi  cult. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the spring seal hunt. For many, the hunt was the fi  rst opportunity to earn some cash as their credit and stores from the previous summer and fall fi  shing season, and other work had been all but exhausted through the winter. The crushing ice fl  oes, icy  waters,  and  unpredictable gales of freezing rain and snow that mark spring in the North Atlantic always claimed ships and men. The scale of the disasters changed as the size of sealing vessels increased with the transition to steam power, reaching its most tragic proportions in the spring of 1914.

The higher overhead costs of steamers, combined with the increasing diffi  culty of fi  nding seals, led the captains and crews of sealing vessels to take greater risks in order to have successful voyages. Sealing skippers divided their larger crews into four watches that they would send onto the pack ice to kill patches of seals. It was rare to find enough seals in one patch to keep all of the watches busy, so captains often dropped a watch in one place and then steamed to another patch of seals to drop more men over the side. Sometimes the steamer would return for a watch, but often the captain expected his men to walk to the vessel, towing seals behind them. However, if bad weather or ice conditions changed for the worse, there was a danger that the sealers might become stranded. Such was the case in 1898, when Captain George Barbour of the SS Greenland lost forty-eight men from one watch in a blizzard. What became known as the 'Greenland disaster' first provoked public outrage about the dangers and working conditions of the hunt. Particularly galling was the rumour that the crew of another steamer had stolen panned seals belonging to the Greenland , forcing it to stay out longer.

The government introduced some reforms, but they did little to prevent other disasters, culminating in the loss of the SS Southern Cross in late March 1914 while en route to St John's from the seal hunt in the Gulf of St Lawrence. Despite the persistence of such tragedies, sealing captains had no diffi  culty in fi  nding sealers to work on their vessels. Crews tended to defer to their captains due to the deadly combination of masculinity and paternalism in the industry. Outport people commonly saw the hunt as a rite of passage; boys were not men until they

had bloodied themselves at the hunt. Fathers often took their sons with them to the hunt, or young men went with their older brothers or uncles. The persistence of payment by shares and the importance of earnings from the hunt meant that sealers admired skippers' reputations as 'real seal killers' or as men who could fi  nd the 'main patch' of the seal herds, thereby assuring a successful hunt for all.

The most famous of all, Captain Abram Kean, had a reputation as a  hard master and canny hunter. He was the master of the sealing crew that had allegedly stolen seals from the Greenland . Although he was embarrassed by the allegations, the sealing captain nonetheless prospered in his profession. Sealers vied with each other to get a berth on Kean's vessels because of his track record. Likewise, men hoped to join the vessels captained by Kean's son Westbury, or one of his nephews' vessels. The Keans often went to the ice together in a fl  eet of steamers.

In the same year as the Southern Cross tragedy, Abram and Westbury Kean played a key role in the most infamous of sealing catastrophes: the Newfoundland disaster of 1914. That spring, Abram took the largest of the steamers, the SS Stephano belonging to Bowring Brothers, to the ice, while Westbury took the Newfoundland , which belonged to a competing fi  rm, Harveys. Despite the competition of the vessel owners, Abram helped his son fi  nd the main patch of seals, although the Newfoundland ,  an  older wooden steamer, had diffi  culty in navigating through the pack ice. On 31 March Westbury decided to send his entire crew over the side under the command of his second hand, George Tuff, to walk to the Stephano . Abram Kean brought many of the crew to a patch of seals, although they had struggled over the ice for over four hours. The weather grew stormy, so Tuff decided to lead the men back to the Newfoundland .  The  crew became lost, but both Keans thought they were safe aboard each other's ships and had no way to contact each other because of the absence of a wireless on the Newfoundland.

The result was what the author Cassie Brown called 'death on the ice.' The crew of the Newfoundland wandered in a raging storm of snow and freezing rain for fi  fty-three hours. Most were improperly clothed and had little food. Fathers and sons, brothers and uncles, and best friends from childhood tried to keep each other going. As hypothermia and exhaustion worsened, men began to hallucinate about their loved ones at home; others sank to the ice in a stupor. Some simply walked off the edge of the ice into the sea. Friends and family tried to pick up the living, but often without success. They might return later

to fi  nd only the dead and face the gruesome choice of having to scavenge for caps, mitts, or food to stay alive. Early on Thursday morning, part of the crew fi  nally struggled to a nearby steamer, the SS Bellaventure , which began a rescue operation. Seventy-eight men died on the ice. Of the fi  fty-fi  ve survivors many were permanently crippled.

St  John's  came to a standstill when people heard of the tragedy. Crowds gathered to watch the maimed and the dead unloaded from the  ship.  At  the  ice,  the  crews  of  other  vessels  began  to  mutiny  as they heard the news but learned that their captains would not stop the hunt. People clamoured for an investigation, but a magisterial inquiry found that no one was criminally responsible. Three thousand people demanded Abram Kean's arrest, and unprecedented public criticism of the seal hunt and its captains spread throughout the island. Coaker accused Kean, a supporter of the Morris government, of being responsible for the disaster. When their fi  ght threatened the government, Morris forced Kean to withdraw libel charges against Coaker. Two members of a commission of inquiry in 1915 agreed that Abram should never have sent the Newfoundland 's men over the side in  a  gathering  storm.  One  other  blamed  the  weather.  Ridiculously, the commission faulted George Tuff for not doing the unheard-of: refusing to take the old man's orders and keep the Newfoundland crew aboard the Stephano ; but it also acknowledged real responsibility when it recommended that shipowners must be held accountable for injury and death among their crews and install safety equipment, weather forecasting equipment, and wireless telegraphs aboard all vessels. 9

Many of these recommendations became law in 1916, although relief came to survivors and families primarily by public subscription to a disaster relief fund. By the summer of 1914, the Newfoundland disaster had appeared to tap a mainspring of anger among fi  shing people about social inequalities. Some sealers threatened to never hunt with Abram Kean again. Yet by 1915 he was back at the ice and went on to more fame and fortune, eventually receiving an appointment to the Legislative Council in 1927 and, in 1934, being awarded the Order of the British Empire when he caught his millionth seal. As in the case of Morris, who was fl  oundering in 1914, war saved Kean's political neck. Morris had been unable to get more fi  nancial support from the Reids, and popular anger growing out of revelations of past timber-speculation scandals had risen to a fury over the fate of the sealers of the Newfoundland . Morris again turned to the idea of Confederation with Canada as a way to fi  nd more money for the railway and to rescue the government from fi  nancial embarrassment, but this further angered

his opponents in St John's, whether mercantile, manufacturing, or Roman Catholic. The outbreak of war led Morris's critics to back off as a part of the general rallying around the fl  ag that accompanied Newfoundland's entry into the First World War.

The organization of Newfoundland's participation in the war was largely an affair of the St John's elite. Morris, to the outrage of Coaker, agreed to surrender government control over Newfoundland's war effort to an organization of private St John's citizens chaired by the governor: the Newfoundland Patriotic Association (NPA). The NPA oversaw Newfoundland and Labrador's war effort until 1917, raising most of the funds for the war effort because the government was nearing fi  nancial ruin largely through railway spending. Mostly composed of local businesspeople, professionals, and journalists, the NPA viewed the city's interests as the same as those of Newfoundland. The NPA made the war effort a non-partisan affair by recruiting the support of members of the Liberal opposition. It raised funds and established the Newfoundland Regiment. The fi  rst fi  ve hundred soldiers shipped out to the ringing cheers of nearly the entire population of the capital. The ready availability of recruits from the more casual labour market of St John's, the assistance of denominationally based cadet corps for city youth, and the almost complete lack of a recruitment system in the outports at the height of the summer fi  shery meant that there were more city than rural men among the fi  rst to go overseas. Nevertheless, by the end of the war, 73.1 per cent, or 5,014, of the 6,754 men who joined the Regiment and the Newfoundland Forestry Corp were from rural Newfoundland and Labrador. Rural recruitment increased every year until 1918, when over 87 per cent of the 2,094 enlistments were from the outports. 10

The Newfoundland Regiment acquitted itself well through many of the toughest battles of the war. It fought the Turks at Gallipoli and the Germans in the muddy trenches of France in the Battle of the Somme in  the  summer of 1916. Transfer to the Eighth Corps of the British Fourth Army led the regiment to tragedy. Allied command assigned the regiment a leading role by asking it to capture an area in the vicinity of Beaumont Hamel, behind the German front line. On 1 July 1916, about 810 offi  cers and men of the Newfoundland Regiment went over the top against the Germans. British command overestimated the impact of artillery bombardments on German defences, and the Allies had failed  to  destroy  a  strategic  machine-gun  emplacement.  When the order came, the Newfoundlanders climbed out of their trenches with rifl  es in hand and advanced toward the German machine guns.

Within minutes the regiment was nearly annihilated. Only two offi  cers and 95 of the men from the regiment answered roll call the next morning. Fifteen offi  cers and 95 other men lay dead on the fi  eld, while 16 offi  cers and 479 men were wounded. One offi  cer and 114 soldiers were missing somewhere among the mud, blood, craters, spent shells, and barbed wire. The attack was a military disaster. 11

Almost  everyone  in  St  John's  lost  a  family  member  or  friend  at Beaumont Hamel. However, in the middle of war, authorities in Newfoundland and the empire could not afford to have the loss viewed as a strategic blunder. Huge church services manifested public grief. Priests and ministers joined British war leaders in preaching duty to empire and glory, but the commemorations of the loss took on messianic overtones of sacrifi  ce, resurrection, and redemption. The people of St John's had now encountered death on a scale so massive it made even the sealing disasters pale by comparison. Newfoundlanders had developed a new sense of national identity as their country seemed to have been baptized in blood at Beaumont Hamel. The myth of Beaumont Hamel quickly emerged, 'emphasizing bravery, determination, imperial loyalty, Christian devotion, and immortal achievement' on the part of the Newfoundland Regiment. 12

The importance of the British connection remained strong, but in 1916 a new nationalism overshadowed it. Elements of this nationalism - especially the notion of Newfoundland as the long-suffering but stolid cornerstone of empire, popular among members of the Newfoundland elite, such as the judge and historian D.W. Prowse, and Sir Robert Bond - had been around since the late nineteenth century. The public commemoration of Beaumont Hamel transformed this nationalism into a mass phenomenon, at least in St John's. 13

By 1917, many people were less enamoured of wartime myths as they began to contrast the sacrifi  ce of Beaumont Hamel with the suspicion that members of the NPA were part of a St John's profi  teering ring. The NPA struggled to maintain suffi  cient recruitment to replace the daily casualties, and there was popular mistrust of the manner in which the organization managed money that it had raised to care for relatives left behind by soldiers going overseas. Rising prices angered people who felt that Water Street merchants controlled imports to inflate coal prices beyond the conditions created by the war. Additional fears grew that fi  sh merchants created artifi  cial shortages of salt and fishing supplies to extort higher prices and that wholesale and retail traders infl  ated prices even more. Water Street merchants drew the ire of outport people by selling off most of their steel-hulled steam-

ers now that the price of used ships was high. These steamers had become an important part of the seal hunt, the marketing of salt cod, the export trade generally, and communication around the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador. 14

The  growing  tension  about  the  NPA  prompted  the  Morris  government to resume control over the war effort in 1917. Many people wanted the government to take control of the marketing of basic goods such as coal to end the profi  teering that a government commission had confi  rmed. Married troops further wanted the government to instate separation allowances, and many people wanted the government to provide pensions to people widowed or made unable to work due to wartime service. Without political friends, Morris turned to Coaker and the Union Party, which had recently abandoned its balance-of-power strategy in favour of allowing its MHAs to serve in Cabinet, hoping that this strategy would allow Union Party platforms to become government policy.

Morris had again been considering the possibility of Confederation. While this had the support of the Reids, it antagonized the merchants of Water Street and opened up the possibility of a marriage of convenience between Morris and the Liberal-Union alliance. Coaker thought that,  should  the  fi  nancial  position  of  Newfoundland  become  much worse, it  would  be  better  to  join  with  Canada  than  to  allow  Newfoundland to be governed by an unelected council that advised the governor and was infl  uenced directly by Water Street.

Although there was supposed to be a general election in 1917, Morris decided to put it off until he could shore up support for his government. Such postponements were common throughout the empire during the war, and the House of Assembly passed the necessary legislation. With the support of the Imperial War Cabinet, Morris invited the Liberal-Union alliance to join the People's Party in a National Government for the sake of a united war effort. Coaker accepted, but he insisted that the National Government must better regulate the export of salt  cod  and  provide  minimum fi  sh  prices.  This  concession was easy for the premier to make: by 1917 the wartime demand for food and the disruption of Newfoundland's competitors' fi  sheries had considerably improved the prices merchants got for their exports.

Coaker,  along  with  fellow  FPU  member  W.W.  Halfyard,  joined the Cabinet, as did four Liberals, including Lloyd, who had become Liberal leader. By the beginning of 1918 Morris, who was in London, had resigned the premiership for a peerage and lucrative directorships in Britain which allowed him to escape the potential political

disgrace he faced at home. He never returned to Newfoundland. As the senior politician, and free of the taint that now affl  icted the People's Party, Lloyd became premier. Suddenly, the FPU members of the House of Assembly found themselves shouldering the burden of an increasingly unpopular war, even as the imperial war effort demanded more sacrifi  ce. The Newfoundland Regiment continued to pay the price of  battle  on  the  fi  elds  of  France,  distinguishing  itself at Gueudecourt, Sailly-Saillisel, Monchy-Le-Preux, the Scarpe, Ypres, Poelcappelle, and Cambrai. The regiment made terrible sacrifi  ces in these battles, especially Ypres, where the Germans fi  rst used poison gas, and Cambrai. St John's physician Cluny Macpherson invented a gas mask which helped reduce allied losses. The regiment's service led the king to grant it the right to call itself the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, but this did not put more men in the ranks. 15

The treatment of some of the veterans of these battles revealed that the new nationalism in St John's had ethnic and regional limits. In September 1914, the Newfoundland government had passed the War Measures Act, which gave it sweeping powers to arrest, detain, exclude, or deport anyone the government deemed an enemy alien. The government detained almost everyone from Germany or the AustroHungarian Empire as enemy aliens, including Moravian missionaries in Labrador, although most of the people who came to St John's were Jews leaving Eastern Europe. The war years proved to be an uneasy time for most immigrants, except for Syrian Christians, who openly supported the British war effort because of the persecution of their communities  in  the  Ottoman  Empire.  Even  among  those  native  to Newfoundland and Labrador, there were limits to what might be recognized in the nationalist mythology of the First World War. About fifty  recruits  for  the  Newfoundland  Regiment,  for  example,  came from the Lake Melville area of Labrador. One of these, John Shiwak of Rigolet, gained fame as a sharpshooter, but died during the battle of Cambrai. Nevertheless, authorities cared little for Shiwak's fellow Labradorians and, at the end of the war, dropped them off at Battle Harbour, an island community and important centre of the fi  shery on the Labrador coast, but over three hundred miles from home. There the former members of the regiment waited for the freeze-up to walk home to places such as North West River. 16

Still without offi  cial representation in St John's, such ill-treated Labradorians had to rely on the infl  uence of the Grenfell Mission. Dr Harry Paddon, who had fi  rst joined the Mission in 1912, took up the cause of the stranded veterans and pressured the government successfully

to pay their travel costs. With Mina Gilchrist, Paddon had established a Grenfell hospital at Mud Lake but moved it to North West River in 1915. The hospital contributed to North West River's status as the administrative centre for much of Labrador. The hospital's nursing and  administrative  staff  formed  a  local  elite  in  North  West  River, and their descendants continued to occupy the important jobs in the hospital and the wider community. With the Moravians, the Grenfell Mission proved helpless in the face of the Spanish infl  uenza epidemic that swept the Labrador coast. At the Moravian missions of Hebron and Okak, 207 of 266 and 150 of 220 residents were dead within fi  ve weeks of the arrival of the fl  u. About one-third of the Inuit people of northern Labrador died, and Okak was abandoned. The fl  u plagued people throughout Newfoundland, but most of the deaths occurred in Labrador, where people had much less medical assistance. In southern Labrador, furious at the inadequate response from St John's, the Grenfell Mission tended the sick and dying as best it could. Paddon, with Henry Gordon, raised funding for dormitory schools to house and educate the many children orphaned by the fl  u. 17

Class  divisions  emerged  alongside  the  ethnic  and  regional  splits in the experience of the Newfoundland and Labrador war effort. A working-class challenge to the status quo was building in St John's and spreading out from the city along the Reid rail line. Workers' concerns about merchant profi  teering, infl  ation, and lack of proper government regulation of the economy resulted in unprecedented union action. The railway was one of the fi  rst concentrated industrial concerns to depend on skilled workers and large numbers of semi-skilled and unskilled workers who, although previously overlooked by craft unions, now worked for the same employers. The Reid Newfoundland Company was vigorously anti-union, but metal workers at the railway had belonged to the International Association of Machinists (IAM), a skilled-workers' trade union. To strengthen their position with the company, the metal workers determined to bring all Reid employees into one industry-wide union. In 1917 they organized the Newfoundland Industrial Workers' Association (NIWA), reinforced by concerns about how wages were not keeping pace with wartime infl  ation.

Initially, the NIWA had the support of FPU member and Unionist  MHA  George  F.  Grimes,  who  had  earlier  been  involved  in  the Newfoundland Socialist Party. Beginning with only 35 members, by 1918 the NIWA had spread its organization along the railway lines to Reid workers elsewhere and built a membership of 3,500, 2,800 of

whom worked in St John's. The union established a newspaper, The Industrial Worker , under the editorship of Warwick Smith. The NIWA also  organized  workers  not  employed by the Reids and advocated political reform to benefi  t all Newfoundland workers. In 1918, failed negotiations with the Reids resulted in a strike made successful by an unprecedented labour unity between the NIWA, the LSPU, and the Truckmen's Protective Union. The NIWA also fought a successful strike on behalf of Port aux Basques workers. A Ladies' Branch, organized by Julia Salter Earle, drew members from women in manufacturing throughout St John's and fought for shorter hours, higher wages, and better working conditions. The Reids decided that it was better to accommodate the NIWA through a joint management-union committee, and thereafter the NIWA became much more moderate. 18

Despite its early success, the NIWA established little political contact with the FPU, which encountered greater political diffi  culties as the end of war approached. Under pressure from the Imperial War Cabinet to provide more troops, the Newfoundland government had considered conscription. As a member of the government, Coaker supported conscription even though there was widespread opposition to it among fi  shing people as yet another oppressive policy coming from St John's. Infl  ated by his offi  ce, Coaker had not consulted the councils of the FPU about his stand. In the meantime, organizations led by St John's businesspeople and professionals such as the Orange Order, the Society of United Fishermen, and the Methodist Church Conference that had formerly supported the NPA campaigned vigorously for conscription. While Coaker appeared a turncoat, he knew that every other party supported conscription and that the FPU would be unlikely to form an alliance with any of them if it broke ranks on conscription. Likely to be tarred as treasonous or cowardly, the Union Party would never be able to secure the better regulation of the fi  shery.

Coaker had sacrifi  ced much in the short term, but the byzantine politics of the capital made that count for naught. Working among the ambitious younger members of the House of Assembly such as Richard Squires was much like swimming with sharks, while the relatively  new  Roman Catholic bishop, E.P. Roche, a conservative and strident man known as the 'Borgia of Branch' for his ruthless politicking  against  those  who  opposed him or his church (the distinctions were small in his mind), began to work against Coaker. Roche had asked Sir Michael Cashin, the senior Catholic member of the People's Party rump, to either convince Bond to come out of retirement or form a government himself, rather than see a coalition persist with the Un-

ion Party. Neither was possible in 1918, but the forces of resentment against the FPU continued to grow. Both Liberals such as Squires and Conservatives such as Cashin squirmed at the Union Party's discipline. Coaker had agreed to a quick spring election in 1919 in which the  National  government  would  campaign  as  a  party.  The  Union Party faced opposition from Squires and Cashin, who tried to bully Premier Lloyd into abandoning the Union Party for a new coalition dominated by Cashin. When Cashin tried to bluff the premier into submission by moving non-confi  dence in the Assembly, the premier seconded the motion, thus forcing Cashin to form a government before he was adequately prepared.

Although a popular politician,  Cashin  was  inept  at  government. He included in his government A.B. Morine, who continued to advocate the interests of the Reids, now widely suspected as profi  teering speculators. To make matters worse, Morine was the minister of justice  and  had  become  identifi  ed  with  the  heavy-handed  use  of  a British cruiser to arrest moonshiners in Bonavista Bay during the fi  shing season, even as it became known that Cashin himself had broken wartime prohibition laws to have liquor at a private party. Furthermore, Cashin had left Richard Squires out of government, which was unwise given that Squires enjoyed both Protestant support and the friendship of Roche and hence became leader of the newly renamed Liberal-Reform Party. 19

With few political allies, the Union Party and Squires's party courted each other. As the election of 1919 loomed Squires began to attack Cashin's party, now known as the Liberal-Progressives, as the tool of the Reid monopoly. Squires promised impartial government, lower taxes, and proper development of natural resources. Coaker agreed that  the  Union  Party  would  join  the  Liberal-Reform  alliance  in  exchange for Squires's promise that he would have a free hand in fi  sheries regulations. Squires was able to make great political capital out of the Reids' and Morine's continued support for Confederation and won the election of 1919 handily. The antipathy of the Liberal-Reform alliance for the Reid interests made them unlikely as an ally of the NIWA's attempt to fi  eld three independent working-class candidates as a Workingmen's Party in St John's. The three candidates failed to be elected, and the NIWA soon declined. The narrow base of the NIWA in the industrial enclave of the St John's railway yards and dockyards meant that it could not survive the layoffs and reorganization of the railway as the Reid Company approached fi  nancial collapse in the postwar recession. 20

Coaker became minister of fi  sheries in the new Squires government, hoping to reorganize the fi  shery. The prices for salt fi  sh had begun to collapse in the wake of postwar recession, encouraging Coaker to act quickly if he was going to have much hope of reforming the fi  shery. The FPU had now developed an institutional interest in the reform of marketing in particular, quite apart from the desire to see each fi  sherman get 'his own.' The UTC had successfully played the same game as  the  other  fi  sh  exporting  fi  rms.  The  membership  of  the  FPU  had invested much in the UTC, which, in turn, had extended a lot of credit to fi  shers during the war. Now that prices were collapsing, the UTC risked failure. As minister of fi  sheries, Coaker took advantage of the War Measures Act (still in effect) to impose regulations over the entire fish trade and thus forestall glutting and further price drops.

In 1920, he tried to establish a more permanent regulation of the fishery through two measures. The fi  rst, the Codfi  sh Standardization Act,  established  a  commission  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  Newfoundland product by regulating all aspects of the catching, processing, culling, warehousing, and shipping of salt fi  sh. By establishing a national system for the grading of fi  sh, Coaker hoped that foreign buyers would no longer be able to offer low prices on the basis of poor cure. The second, the Salt Codfi  sh Exportation Act, attempted to end the ruinous competition between Newfoundland fi  sh exporters. The act established a board of four licensed exporters, but chaired by the minister of fi  sheries. Only fi  rms granted a licence by this board could export fi  sh. The main condition for receiving such a licence was observance of minimum conditions fi  xed by the board for the maximum amount of fi  sh that could be sold in any season and the minimum prices for which such fi  sh could be sold. Coaker's goal was to prevent fish merchants from undercutting one another's prices and glutting the market. In the long term, he thought, Newfoundland's fi  sh markets would become much more stable.

Initially there was widespread support for Coaker's Regulations, as they became known, because they seemed to promise a rescue from the deteriorating market conditions of the Newfoundland trade. Never before, however, had a Newfoundland government intervened so much to regulate the actual terms of trade of any industry, let alone the trade Water Street merchants jealously guarded as their private preserve.  Coaker's  mercantile  opponents  in  the  Liberal-Progressive Party, such as Sir John Crosbie, resented the FPU's interference. Local banks further disliked the government's attempt to regulate the market and restricted credit to fi  rms that cooperated with the Exportation

Board. In effect, the banks encouraged clients who chose to sell fi  sh at prices below those set by the board in the hope of increasing overall income by volume rather than value. A stunning loophole in Coaker's  Regulations  allowed  companies  to  get  away  with  this  practice because, should one lose its licence by underselling, it could always acquire another issued in the name of the company's general manager. Merchants such as Crosbie and A.E. Hickman further cooperated with foreign buyers, particularly the Italians, to frustrate the Coaker Regulations by refusing to buy on the Exportation Board's terms. Individual fi  rms had long been more concerned with competing with neighbouring fi  rms on Water Street than with their international competitors. Now such fi  rms' banks encouraged each to pursue its own interest and ability to repay its debts in the context of a deepening depression. Not surprisingly, the fi  rms broke with the Board to sell fish below price. By 1921, at the instigation of the Board of Trade, the government repealed Coaker's Regulations. 21

The failure of the regulations opened a fl  oodgate of political disillusionment with the working of liberal democracy in Newfoundland and Labrador. Without market regulations, fi  sh prices dropped, and the Squires government found that Newfoundland's public debt and obligations to the railway left it with very little room to manoeuvre. Newfoundland had a war debt of about $35 million and an annual railway debt of $1.3 million. The railway had not led to signifi  cant industrial diversifi  cation; most people depended on the fi  shery, and even markets for newsprint from Grand Falls were falling off. The Squires  government  had  come  to  power  partially  by  campaigning against the Reid interests but now had to provide more assistance to the  railway  or  risk  higher  unemployment.  Newfoundlanders  were wary of the plutocratic Reids and suspected, rightly or wrongly, that the railway family had Squires in their back pocket. Bitter at the failure of his regulations, Coaker stood by as the government fl  ailed; he saw both Squires and the opposition caught up in a corrupt contest of political bribery, each trying to shore up its support with unemployed and desperate voters by promising more spending on relief and public works, all of which the government could ill afford.

By 1922, Coaker was ready to quit politics but remained in government largely to support its efforts to secure another pulp and paper development on the Humber River. By turning to another large-scale forestry industry project for economic salvation, the Squires government returned to earlier Liberal national policies of incurring huge public debt to attract foreign capital, but Coaker saw little other hope

to  solve  the  colony's  looming  economic  and  social  crisis.  The  FPU leader was lukewarm in his support for Squires, who was rarely in Newfoundland. Deputy Premier Alex Campbell was usually at the helm, doling out relief money in the districts of Liberal-Reform members of the Assembly to shore up support. When Squires was active, as in his negotiations to acquire timber rights to support the Humber project, the premier's actions seemed somehow foul. The Reids controlled most of the timber rights that might support the Humber project and would gain by any arrangement for another pulp and paper mill. As a general election drew near, Squires supported a proposal by the Reids in partnership with the engineering fi  rm of Armstrong, Whitworth and Company for the development of a pulp mill at the mouth of the Humber River, as well as a hydroelectric plant upstream at what was to become Deer Lake. The government negotiated a fi  nancing arrangement with the British Treasury in 1922, but the Reids continued to demand more money for the railway's operation and actually closed it that year knowing full well that neither the British government nor the Armstrongs would be interested in an industrial development that depended on the railway and other Reid assets. The Squires government had to purchase these rights for the sum of $2 million.

It certainly looked as if Squires had hypocritically participated in another speculative act of profi  teering by the Reids, although his government had bargained them down from their initial asking price of $2.4 million. Nonetheless, Coaker supported Squires largely on the strength  of  the  premier's  Humber  development  platform.  Squires won the 1923 general election on a campaign to put the 'Hum on the Humber' through a settlement of the railway and new pulp mill deals. His new government passed legislation guaranteeing mortgages for the Armstrongs. As part of the deal, the Reids would get $1.5 million from the engineering company and royalties and dividends on developed water power and newsprint once it transferred its timber lands to the new company. The government got an export tax of $1 per ton on newsprint and a waterpower royalty. The Armstrongs' licence to operate otherwise was the same as that of the AND Company. To facilitate the deal, the government agreed to buy and operate the railway, coastal steam service, Gulf ferry, and dry dock. 22

Although he had secured a major industrial development, the premier was in a precarious position. He had originally become premier in  1919  as  the  candidate  who  would save Newfoundland from the People's Party's close association with big corporations such as the

Reids and the AND Company. But Squires had found no way to cope with the public debt and poverty without also seeking the goodwill of these same corporations. Many voters concluded that Squires was no better than the People's Party remnant, then calling itself the LiberalLabour-Progressive  Party.  The  latter  was  much  more  disorganized and therefore lost the 1923 election, or so it seemed. Squires's lieutenant Alexander Campbell lost his seat in the election.

Unwilling to lose him in Cabinet, Squires appointed Campbell to the Legislative Council. This action rallied the opposition, who saw Campbell as the mastermind of patronage who had contributed so much to their defeat. Cashin accused Campbell of using public relief to buy votes during the election and, with the assistance of prominent St  John's  lawyer  W.J.  Higgins,  provided  evidence  suggesting  that Squires might have been directly involved in political bribery and the embezzlement of government funds. This evidence forced the attorney general William Warren to demand unsuccessfully that Squires fire  Campbell.  Incensed  that  Squires  had  likely  accepted  a  $43,000 campaign donation from the operators of the iron ore mine on Bell Island, to modify in their favour a 1919 labour contract Coaker had negotiated, the FPU leader supported Warren when he and his fellow ministers resigned from Cabinet, forcing Squires to resign.

The governor asked Warren to form a new government. Although the new premier had hoped to build a non-partisan administration, he could not entice the opposition to join with Union Party members. This left Warren in the embarrassing position of having to appoint a commission of inquiry into alleged wrongdoings by members of a party government that was essentially the same as his own. In order to make sure that such a commission was without doubt removed from any possibility of government interference, the new premier turned to the British government to recommend a commissioner; they suggested British offi  cial Thomas Hollis Walker. Hollis Walker thoroughly investigated the liquor control board, not corruption generally, which would in all likelihood have tainted many politicians on both sides of the House. His report, submitted on 21 March 1924, revealed inappropriate payments from the Liquor Control Department, of which $20,000 could be directly traced to Squires. The Hollis Walker report found that Squires had taken the money in the Bell Island affair as alleged  and  that  Campbell  had  used  government  contracts  to  buy votes.

A political  circus  followed.  The  FPU  supporters  of  Warren's  administration had never been involved in the Squires's government's

misdeeds. They immediately demanded that the government press charges against Squires, Campbell, and John Meaney, Squires's appointee as head of the Liquor Control Department. Squires, who had been arrested but was out on bail, scurried to the opposition benches with some of his supporters. Warren's government fell, but he hoped to build a new coalition with the opposition to rid himself of dependence on the FPU. Warren cobbled together a ministry that lasted fi  ve days before it failed. A.E. Hickman formed another Liberal government after Coaker declined the opportunity to become premier. Hickman faced the Conservatives led by Walter Monroe in the general election of 1924. 23

Monroe was the candidate of the St John's business community and working class, and had the support of Roche and the Roman Catholic Church. He was president of the Imperial Tobacco Company and a director of the Colonial Cordage Company, two St John's manufacturing establishments that had benefi  ted substantially by tariff protection. He had little sympathy for the anti-protectionist and anti-St John's rhetoric of the FPU, neither sentiment of which would sit well with the city's working class. In the political tussle that had followed the Hollis Walker report, the FPU's political candidates found themselves isolated and guilty by association with the Squires government. In the general political disillusionment that followed, it was easy for many people to confuse their old anger with Coaker (about issues such as conscription)  with  their  present  frustrations  about  political  corruption  and  economic depression. Monroe capitalized on all of this to marginalize the FPU. Although the FPU tried to portray itself as lilywhite in the  1924  campaign,  Monroe made it guilty by association with Squires and his cronies. Monroe campaigned on the promise that he would bring good, clean, and honest business principles to the administration of government. Reinforcing the notion that Newfoundland's economic problems resulted from petty corruption rather than fundamental errors in policy, Monroe's economic policies continued those begun by the Liberals under Whiteway. Monroe's party won the election, including among its MHAs W.L. Linegar, the Workingmen's Party candidate and president of the coopers' union in St John's.

Like the Squires government, the new Monroe administration had to borrow money for relief and public works to combat the problems of deepening depression. Monroe actually made the fi  nancial conditions worse when, loyal to his class, he cut income tax, which was paid only by a small portion of relatively prosperous individuals. The mass of people continued to carry the burden of paying for govern-

ment through the customs duties on all of the imported goods they consumed. To protect St John's manufacturing and replace lost revenue, the premier raised the duties. Such a policy could not help fi  shers buy more domestically produced manufactures, and it also raised their cost of living.

Monroe's economic policies, while pleasing to the residents of St John's who worked in its factories, looked to many more as a direct boon to the premier's own manufacturing interests. Even the higher duties  did  not  apply  equally  to  all.  In  some  cases,  the  premier  appeared to benefi  t  personally,  as  when  the  government  allowed  the Newfoundland Light and Power Company, of which Monroe was a director, to import materials duty-free for its city streetcar railway. In other areas, Monroe had little choice. The ailing fi  shery meant that Newfoundland was becoming more and more the hostage of the large corporations that exploited its natural resources. The government had to allow the AND Company to import equipment duty-free in order to get it to develop a mine at Buchans, and had to fi  nancially induce the International Power and Paper Company to take over the pulp and paper development on the west coast. Both companies further demanded, and duly received, tax concessions to continue with development. 24

There  were,  however,  positive  achievements  during  the  Monroe administration.  The  most  socially  important  political  development was the concession of the right to vote to women in 1925. Women throughout Newfoundland, both outport and city, had supported the Women's Patriotic Association (WPA), founded by Lady Davidson in 1914. The wives of outport clergy organized the WPA's 183 branches there, with a total membership of over 7,000 in the fi  rst year of the First World War. The WPA concentrated on providing supplies that would make life as comfortable as possible for troops overseas. Having roots in the local temperance activities of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in the early 1890s, the women's suffrage movement was strongest in St John's. There, the wives and daughters of the city's business and professional elites now further demanded political equality with their male relatives based on their importance on the home front in the WPA during the Great War.

In 1909, banned from local Protestant literary and discussion clubs due to their  male  membership's  fear  of  the  British  female  suffrage movement,  city  women  had  formed  a  Ladies'  Reading  Room  and Current Events Club. In each other's congenial company, the privileged women of St John's debated the political and intellectual fash-

ions of the day, ranging from socialism to exotic religions, and gained confi  dence in their political abilities and entitlements, building on the education, cultivation, and social connections that only wealth could provide. In 1920, the feminists of the Ladies' Reading Room began an explicit campaign for women's equal political rights through the formation of the Newfoundland Women's Franchise League. Unlike the earlier  organizations of women, the League included Roman Catholics  and Protestants, and professional women such as nurse Mary Southcott and educators Emilie Fraser and Violet Cherrington.

The importance of the WPA to the war effort, as well as the same women's leadership of organizations such as the Child Welfare Association and the Newfoundland Outport Nursing and Industrial Association (NONIA), made it very diffi  cult for male politicians of the Assembly to oppose their demands, and the FPU began to support the cause of women's suffrage. NONIA - founded by Lady Constance Harris, wife of Governor Sir Charles A. Harris, in 1920, and consolidated by her successor, Lady Elsie Allardyce, in 1924 - provided outports with professional nurses and midwives paid for by the knitting and other crafts of outport women. As the mayor of St John's, W.G. Gosling had included women's suffrage in the city's municipal charter of 1921. Richard Squires had opposed the women's suffrage movement as an indulgence by the upper crust of St John's. Monroe took up the cause, which provided him with another political tie to the city's working class. The achievement of suffrage led the Franchise League to reconstitute itself as the League of Women Voters. One of the new League's main platforms was 'equal rights for rich and poor ... work and good wages for all.' Julia Salter Earle used her familiarity with government, gained through her job as engrossing clerk of the legislature, to help in the fi  ght for working-class rights. In 1925, Earle, with May Kennedy and Fannie McNeil, decided to run for St John's council. While all were defeated, Earle received twice as many votes as her bourgeois running mates combined and came very close to being elected.

The  defeat  of  Earle  and  the  others  indicates  that,  although  the franchise was an important step in the struggle for women's rights, the foundations of social patriarchy were still quite strong. The fi  rst woman to be elected to the legislature, Lady Helena Squires, ran in a Liberal safe seat in 1930 as a supporter of her husband Sir Richard, not as an advocate of women's rights. The Monroe government itself further entrenched social patriarchy by extending old-age pensions to some women only if they were widows receiving income in right of their deceased husbands. 25

The elderly of rural Newfoundland and Labrador were not the only women to experience the inequalities of patriarchal society. Younger outport women, like their counterparts from the St John's area, found limited opportunities for work and poor pay in the city. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, increasing numbers of young women looked for work in the capital to supplement the meagre earnings of their working-class or fi  shing families. Few daughters of the city's mercantile and professional families had to work; most working women were the daughters of households headed by unemployed men, longshoremen, carpenters, or labourers. Mercantile and professional households demanded domestic servants, the new clothing factories preferred to hire women as garment workers, the retail trades wanted women as sales clerks, restaurants looked for waitresses, and the offi  ces of Water Street looked for female typists. Employers tended to hire young, single women, justifying their low wages by arguing that these women did not have families to support. Such rationalizations misrepresented the importance of young women's work to the survival of their parents and siblings. Very few women earned enough to live alone, and society morally disapproved of working women who did. There were few boarding houses for women in St John's. The churches and the Grenfell Association operated some accommodations, which could be much regimented, and by 1926 the YWCA had appeared.

If they married, women found that their household duties and employers' expectations left little room for paid employment. St John's was still a city in which many working-class households did not have running water and depended on wood or coal-burning stoves. The labour of fetching wood and water and cleaning and cooking under such conditions fell to women. Childcare further meant that few married women could work outside the home for wages, although they might sew or clean for neighbours. Most women had no representation in unions; there had been few attempts by labour organizers to address the concerns of women since the NIWA had begun to organize retail workers in 1918. Sadly, the postwar recession and demise of the NIWA ended the initiative. 26

The Monroe government ensured that the resources of Labrador would remain within the grasp of Newfoundland developers by winning a dispute over boundaries with Canada in 1927. Quebec governments had never accepted Newfoundland's control over Labrador. Quebec  objections  had  led  the  British  government  to  establish  a boundary between Quebec and Labrador in 1825 to return people of French-Canadian descent to Lower-Canadian jurisdiction. The act of

1825 established the line of 52 degrees latitude as the southern boundary of Labrador. In 1898, the Canadian government had passed an act that attempted to extend the northern boundary of Quebec into territory held under Newfoundland jurisdiction. Quebec companies were interested  in  the  forest,  mineral,  and  water  power  resources  of  the region, especially of Hamilton Inlet and the Hamilton River.

By  1907,  Newfoundland  had  agreed  to  arbitration  of  the  border dispute by the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council. While Sir  Patrick  McGrath  prepared  Newfoundland's  case,  the  Monroe government almost undercut itself  in  1924.  Desperate  to  raise  revenue, the government considered selling Labrador to Quebec for $30 million, preserving only fi  shing rights along the coast for Newfoundlanders. Even with the sale price cut in half, the Quebec government preferred to wait for the outcome of the arbitration. The arbitrators quickly settled the border south of the 52nd parallel due to the precedents of the Hudson's Bay Company's grant of Rupert's Land, the Treaty of Paris and Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Quebec Act of 1774,  the  1809  transfer,  and  the  1825  Boundary  Act.  The  Canadian government, however, claimed that the Newfoundland government was only entitled to a narrow coastal strip for the fi  shery above the 52nd  parallel.  The  Newfoundland  government  pointed  to  the  delimitation of Rupert's Land by watershed, the precedents of resource use by settlers of Newfoundland descent, and the precedent of Newfoundland judicial jurisdiction to counter successfully the Canadian claim. In 1927, the Privy Council accepted Newfoundland's claim to all  territory from the height of land north of the 52nd parallel. The Monroe  government's  offer  of  sale  revealed  that  it  saw  Labrador as  an  asset,  nothing  more,  to  be  sold  or  leased  as  the  government thought convenient. 27

The benefi  t  of  the  decision  for  Labradorians  was  far  less  certain. The decision ignored completely the Innu's use of territory on both sides of the new boundary. The Newfoundland government refused to even consider the Innu as native to the Newfoundland side of the boundary, preferring to see them as traders and hunters from Canada. The government had little interest in understanding the Innu's use of much of the interior for the caribou hunt, and the people otherwise did not come to the coast to exploit marine resources. A dramatic reduction in caribou populations had forced many Innu to relocate closer to the coast in 1916. There they traded more with the HBC store, but the Innu resorted to interior bays for trapping and did not fi  sh for cod or char. On the rare occasions when they impinged on the consciousness

of Newfoundland government offi  cials, the Innu appeared as visitors rather than as inhabitants, or as people with no real property rights. 28

Victory in the Labrador boundary dispute did not help much to improve the popular image of the government or to restore public faith in the political system. Desperate to create employment by courting international corporations, and also unwilling to address the problems of the fi  shery rather than hoping for some sort of landward diversification boom, Monroe's government looked as bad as its predecessors. Coaker, bitter and stung by the ruthless and unfair campaign of Monroe in 1924, recommended to the 1925 annual convention of the FPU that Newfoundland should take a ten-year rest from democracy by appointing a commission of government. This did not stop him from coming out of retirement to join Squires in a successful election campaign in 1928. Coaker returned to government, hoping he could develop regulations for the fi  shery. By the end of 1929, however, the Great Depression was in full swing; prices in the fi  shery dropped even further, and few fi  rms were interested in cooperating with Coaker. By 1932, it was obvious that the government had no stomach for effective regulations, so Coaker left politics to manage the business enterprises of the union. 29

The Squires government struggled to borrow money as the world depression and demands for public relief grew, but this was becoming almost impossible due to its existing debt. In November 1929, the government had found itself unable to cope with a major public disaster when a tsunami struck the Burin Peninsula, causing more than $1 million in property damage and the loss of at least twenty-seven lives, and leaving many families without homes or the means of subsistence as winter approached. The government sent a relief ship with some supplies but relied on private subscriptions from Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, as well as from Canada, the United States, and England to provide the assistance it could not afford. 30

As the government struggled, Coaker criticized it for not embarking on a program of fi  nancial retrenchment. By now, any leftist leanings had disappeared from the FPU leader's views. He had no confi  dence in the political culture of Newfoundland and felt that the poor who demanded public relief during riots in St John's in 1932 were simple dupes of politicians and merchants such as H.A. Winter and Eric Bowering, who would make any patronage promise to secure political power. The FPU leader looked elsewhere for the antidote for Newfoundland's political ailments. He found it in the fascist government of Italy, particularly as its corporatist organization of national fi  sh pur-

chasing, known as the Consorzio , had proven so effective in stymying the original Coaker Regulations. Coaker claimed that Newfoundland needed its own Mussolini to overcome the infl  uence of merchants and industrialists in party politics. By contrast with the social unrest in Newfoundland, Coaker marvelled at fascist order - 'countless welldressed policemen, Blackshirts, and national soldiers, Boy Scouts in black shirt uniforms in every city and town' - and apparent economic progress. 31

There was not much of a political left to counterbalance the turn to the right signalled by Coaker's fascination with Italian fascism. Newfoundlanders were aware of the postwar growth of socialism, industrial unionism, and independent labour politics across the Cabot Strait. Many Newfoundlanders, such as Silby Barrett, worked in the Maritimes, especially in the coal and steel towns of Cape Breton. The antilabour stance of Roy Wolvin, the director of the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO) in the early 1920s, had been followed closely in Newfoundland because of BESCO's ownership of the mines at Bell Island. Although socialists were active in Newfoundland, the NIWA and the LSPU had adopted a more moderate political stance, which persisted as concern grew in the St John's newspapers about the various syndicalist, industrial unionist, socialist, and communist dimensions in general and sympathetic strikes, not only in Canada, but in the United States, Britain, and continental Europe. The potential for working-class radicalism and labour unrest in the 1920s scared people in St John's. Anything that smacked of working-class independence in Newfoundland was likely to draw a charge of Bolshevism. In St John's, Julia Salter Earle wrote, as 'The Working-Man's Friend,' that there was little to worry about. She felt that local workers were interested in a Christian progressivism; they only wished to be consulted more on public affairs. 32

Nevertheless, the press continued to worry. Throughout the spring of  1926,  the  newspapers  had  been  closely  following  the  worsening situation  in  the  British  coal  industry.  As  a  general  strike  loomed, locally  the Daily News feared  that  such  an  action  would  'shake  the very foundations of the industrial life of Britain, and under certain circumstances, render conditions almost indistinguishable from civil warfare.' It greeted the development of a general strike as 'a revolutionary movement, instigated and developed by alien communists.' 33 At home, while the major forestry companies required loggers, people from fi  shing communities were reluctant to assume the high costs of travelling to low-paid jobs in distant camps. Unrest always seemed to

be a possibility among loggers. Similarly, the press worried about the potential for unrest among the miners of Bell Island, some of whom had formed the Wabana Mine Workers' Union (WMWU) in 1922, affiliated with the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. In 1925, BESCO forced striking WMWU workers to take a pay cut by threatening to close the mine, something it had already done in Cape Breton. The next year, the demoralized WMWU collapsed, but workers' unrest continued because BESCO was scaling back operations and laying off workers. 34

The St John's labour movement and the city's business community were becoming disillusioned with the workings of democracy in Newfoundland. Labour reformism had led to disappointing alliances with protectionists such as Monroe. The absence of a strong local socialist intellectual tradition meant that local working-class organizations did not benefi  t from critical analyses of the structural economic problems of their country. Most labour leaders indulged in the accusations of corruption and short-sightedness that the established political parties hurled at each other. The St John's bourgeoisie could offer no solutions. Its business leaders, whether merchants or manufacturers, had helped to block fi  sheries reform, and they and their families now stood frightened by the rising tide of social discontent. Rather than blame the  inadequacies  of  their  own  particular  political  programs, everyone found it easy to blame democracy generally and the Squires government in particular. Without the fi  nancial resources to help the unemployed, the Squires government could only engage in futile gestures, such as building on an already restrictive immigration act of 1926. In 1932, the government prohibited working-class immigration in addition to that of most Europeans and all Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans. 35

The onset of the Great Depression revealed the limited and fragile  nature  of  Newfoundland's  industrial  development.  Diversifi  cation  policies  had  proved  costly  to  a  government  already  burdened with old railway liabilities, and now the debt of the First World War. The downturn in the international economy struck hard at export-dependent industries such as the fi  shery, leading to demands for public relief that the government could barely meet. Ongoing credit restrictions by merchants worsened the relief problem. Emigration, railway development, service in the war, and newer industrial development all  gave  some people a chance to skip out on their debts. Seasonal employment in other industries gave some fi  shers the chance to market more freely through merchants other than their usual suppliers.

Some trap skippers had even become successful enough to trade on their own account and vied with more established fi  rms in trying to garner fi  sh supplies made scarcer by declining catches. Long-established merchant fi  rms responded by restricting credit even further in the 1930s. People reacted against credit restriction throughout Newfoundland and Labrador with threats of violence and store-breaking against merchant fi  rms. Communities closed ranks to protect the perpetrators of such actions. Under pressure from merchants, the government extended even more public relief through merchant accounts but could not long bear the expense. 36

The condition of the poor was appalling. About one-third of the Newfoundland  population  depended  on  public  relief.  As  distress grew, so did public anger. During the summer of 1931, Premier Squires feared 'Red tendencies' among the crowds of unemployed people who had demanded better relief in Conception Bay and St John's. Squires asked the British navy to station a cruiser nearby to keep order. The Newfoundland government continued to cut spending and hired R.J. Magor, a Montreal businessman, to organize a much-reduced relief system. Since the 1920s, unemployed workers in St John's had been organizing under the leadership of unionists such as Jim McGrath, the president of the LSPU from 1905 to 1920. In 1932, McGrath was often at the head of delegations from the Unemployed Committee and at its protests against Magor's relief reforms. In February, a crowd assaulted Squires at the St John's Court House. Unrest spread to the north side of Conception Bay, where many of the miners who worked at Bell Island lived when not employed in the mines.

Government tinkering with the relief system did not improve it. Further austerity measures led to a protest at the Colonial Building in March. At least 250 unemployed workers demanded that the government help them, and their demonstration developed into a riot. People smashed windows, and their actions forced Squires to fl  ee. Although the crowd dispersed, there were more meetings and marches by the unemployed throughout April, prompting Squires to call for another naval cruiser to cow the crowd. 37

The relief crisis was one manifestation of the manner in which the Squires government found it increasingly diffi  cult to meet all of its fi  nancial obligations. It could not meet the day-to-day running expenses of government, including hiring and equipping more police to control protestors, or meet the huge interest payments on the public debt. The government considered defaulting on the public debt by suspending or rescheduling interest payments, but this was anathema to offi  cials

in  the  British  government. After all, by the Statute of Westminster, Newfoundland had been named as a self-governing 'Dominion' of the British Empire. The British Treasury feared that even a partial default on its debt by Newfoundland would affect the credit of all the British dominions. The Squires government had turned to four Canadian banks, especially the Bank of Montreal, hoping without luck for  a  bailout  similar  to  that  of  the  bank  crash  in  1894.  At  Squires's behest, the Canadian government convinced the Canadian banks to lend Newfoundland more money. In exchange, the Newfoundland government accepted a representative of the Canadian banks to control the use of the funds.

The  Canadian  banks  feared  that  Canada's  credit  would  suffer  if Newfoundland defaulted. Desperate, the elected government surrendered control over its  spending.  In  a  last,  desperate  effort  to  stave off fi  nancial collapse, Squires tried to sell Labrador to Quebec, with no luck. Rising anger at yet more revelations about Squires's political malfeasance, which had contributed to the spring riot in St John's, forced him from offi  ce. Frederick Alderdice, with the support of Water Street merchants and Coaker, neither of whom was willing to support democracy in Newfoundland, led a United Newfoundland Party that  won a subsequent general election. Alderdice attempted to alleviate the country's fi  nancial situation by leasing Labrador to British interests for ninety-nine years, but again the attempt failed. Public anger at the inability of the government to assist the poor had continued to mount and exploded in a series of riots in St John's and across the island during the winter of 1932. 38

Alderdice  also  considered  defaulting  on  Newfoundland's  public debt, but yielded as well to imperial fears that such an action would hurt Newfoundland's and Britain's reputations. The British and Canadian governments arranged more loans for Newfoundland, but on the condition that it accept a joint commission of inquiry into Newfoundland's  fi  nancial  affairs  composed  of  British,  Canadian,  and Newfoundland representatives. The British appointed Lord Amulree, a Labour peer, to lead the commission. Before he left Britain the Treasury and Dominions Offi  ce made clear to Amulree that Newfoundland was not to default and that the British taxpayer would not be expected to  underwrite  the  colonial  treasury  unless  the  government  in  London, not Newfoundland politicians, had control over the spending. The Canadian representative on the Amulree Commission, Charles A. Magrath, did not feel that Newfoundland's problems were too severe. Magrath thought that a partial rescheduling of payments on its public

debt and further fi  nancial help from Canada and Britain would see Newfoundland through its crisis, although he felt that the best option was Confederation with Canada. However, the Canadian government was unprepared to help further, and Britain remained determined to take political control over Newfoundland if it was to be the source of financial  help.  Alderdice  had  picked  Canadian  banking adviser Sir William Stavert to represent Newfoundland on the commission. The Canadian banks favoured Britain's plans to take over the direction of Newfoundland's affairs; Stavert consequently was no advocate of Newfoundland's constitutional independence.

The unfortunate precedent of the Hollis Walker report meant that the Amulree Commission was predisposed to fi  nd a people living in a society and economy that by its very nature mired them in despondency and corruption rather than to investigate the long-term structural problems of the Newfoundland economy. Amulree justifi  ed the suspension of democratic government, and did so by mistaking the appalling conditions of the depression with the long-term pattern of life in the colony. His report admitted that the seasonal and occupational pluralism of the outports usually kept people healthy, and that their current misery was primarily the result of credit contraction due to the depression. 39

Finding a sympathetic ear in the Alderdice government, the Amulree Commission recommended that Newfoundland's democratic selfgovernment be replaced by a non-democratic commission appointed by Britain. Coaker approved of the plan, as did Wilfred Grenfell and many other infl  uential Newfoundlanders. There were few voices of opposition. On 16 February 1934, Premier Alderdice signed the papers that surrendered Newfoundland's dominion status and its democracy. Although local nationalism had been fuelled by the sacrifi  ce of war, such sacrifi  ce meant little in the context of the inexorable, if more banal, tide of economic waste and debt associated with the colony's version of the national policy. Nationalism may have been fostered at Beaumont Hamel, but it failed to thrive on war and railway debt, combined with neglect of the fi  sheries and cynicism about government's courting of international capital. By the mid-1930s, it appeared that a new class-based opposition to the waste of the national policy had emerged. It fell to the Commission of Government to stifl  e such opposition.

## Commission, Depression, and War, 1934-1945

The Commission of Government arrived in St John's with the diagnosis of Newfoundland and Labrador's problems contained in the Amulree Report in hand. The commission intended to set right government finances and the relationship between fi  shers and merchants, workers and employers. Six commissioners were to govern; three Newfoundlanders took charge of the departments of Justice, Health and Home Affairs, and Education, while three British civil servants took control of the departments that were responsible for the country's fi  nances and economy: Finance, Public Utilities, and Natural Resources. The governor chaired the commission. Approaching its task as if the real problems of Newfoundland and Labrador required only better administration and moral reform of society and politics, the commission failed to achieve signifi  cant economic reform. It lapsed into many of the policies of previous governments and, although it took more interest in the needs of Labradorians, tended to take the part of capitalists over working people. It took the advent of war in 1939 to bring about improvements in the lives of working Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.

In the early years of the depression, Newfoundland's paper companies responded to decreasing demand for paper by cutting back production and paying lower prices for pulpwood that was cut by logging subcontractors. The companies also reduced the wages paid to loggers and provided them with miserable camps in the woods. Loggers often travelled long distances by train to work, but the price of their fares was not included in their wages. At the same time, both

the AND Company mill at Grand Falls and the International Power and Paper (IPP) Company mill at Corner Brook denied responsibility for the working conditions in the woods, since they were the domain of the subcontractors.

One of the fi  rst acts of the commission had been to pass a Public Enquiries Act that enabled it to look into complaints, such as those in the forestry sector, about poor wages and working conditions. But their  track  record  was disappointing. In 1933, for example, the IPP Company hired loggers directly at 22 cents per hour and later asked the  government to waive the legal minimum wage of 35 cents per hour. A two-week strike against the IPP action resulted in the government suspending the minimum wage law, a move that discredited the government in the minds of these workers. Throughout 1934 strikes and civil tension increased. Finally, the commission responded by appointing F. Gordon Bradley, the last opposition leader in the defunct House of Assembly, to investigate loggers' complaints.

Bradley crossed Newfoundland, gathering evidence of poor wages, dangerous work, and relentless poverty for loggers and their families. The paper companies blamed the loggers' plight on the depression, but Bradley pointed out that those well-paid, skilled workers in the pulp and paper plants who had strong unions, and managers and owners, did not suffer in the same way. Aghast at such an openly critical  assessment  of  one  of  the  country's  leading  industries,  and fearful that the former politician Bradley would try to use the inaction of the commission to build a political basis of support among those who worked in the woods, the commission did not publish his report but made Bradley a magistrate. In exchange for suppressing what became known as the Bradley Report and Bradley's recommendation of a minimum price per cord for wood, the paper companies agreed to pay a minimum net monthly wage of $25 to those loggers they directly employed. 1

The situation in the woods clearly illustrated for the commission the deep-rooted social problems embedded in the structures of economic  development in Newfoundland and Labrador. Throughout 1934, to  take  another  example,  the  British  Commissioner  Sir  John  Hope Simpson, responsible for the Department of Natural Resources, often remarked on the scandalous poverty suffered by loggers and their families in his letters to relatives in Britain. Hope Simpson claimed that the commission was determined to prevent the paper companies from running roughshod over loggers and that it would not allow them to be treated like 'sweated labour' in the manner that the Bel-

gians had exploited the people of the Congo. And yet his wife, Lady Hope Simpson, upon touring the outports with Sir John, argued that poverty and depravity ran together among the living conditions of coastal  Newfoundlanders: 'Savages have better arrangements. And savages manage their social morality better.' Hope Simpson further tended to feel that many loggers could not earn enough because they were unskilled at their work and did not have the initiative and fortitude to make a go at logging. Although critical of the IPP as an American company, Hope Simpson allowed that the British AND treated its loggers better. He spoke about loggers with the managers of both corporations over dinner and a bridge party at St John's fi  nest hotel. Later in the summer, Sir John and Lady Hope Simpson travelled to the IPP mill site at Humbermouth, where 'the International Paper people' organized a pleasure cruise and 'gave us a slap-up lunch at the Glynmill Inn.'  Desperate to attract investment to Newfoundland 2 and Labrador, the commission kept up appearances by chastising the paper companies, but Hope Simpson hardly confronted them.

Instead,  the  commission  concentrated  on  uplifting  the  'savages.' The commission took its lead from the Amulree Report, seeing Newfoundland  and  Labrador's  social  and  economic  problems  as  stemming from deep-rooted social and political demoralization. The new administration  planned  to  stimulate  the  integrity  of  the  people  by giving  them  more  orderly  administration,  primarily  by  creating  a Newfoundland Ranger Force. More than a police force, the Rangers became the unelected administrators of basic government services in rural areas, while the Newfoundland Constabulary continued policing  urban  areas.  The  Rangers  were  responsible  to  the  Department of Natural Resources rather than Justice, and controlled by a Newfoundland Commissioner. The force was an expensive undertaking for an administration that was supposed to restore public solvency, but Hope Simpson justifi  ed the expense to the British Treasury by explaining that the Rangers would oversee economic development and social  revitalization  in  model  communities  the  commission  would foster, such as one at Markland, which would develop beaver farms for a local fur industry.

Hope Simpson wanted to use magistrates and Rangers in an integrated system of administration similar to that used by the British colonial administration in India, where he had been posted prior to Newfoundland. Magistrates, like the Rangers, were to report to the government on their district's natural resources, public facilities, economic  developments,  likely  additional  infrastructure  requirements

## 212 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

in such areas as public sanitation, and the operation of existing government agencies such as the post offi  ce. 3 It  became clear, however, between 1935 and 1937 that the magistrates were too busy with their judicial  work  to  be  the  political  and  administrative  representatives of the commission, so the Rangers took over most of the functions of district offi  cers. As the administrators of public relief, they had very little time left for all of their other duties, which included enforcing the regulations associated with the day-to-day running of almost every government department throughout rural areas. Travelling over great distances, the Rangers acquired an excellent reputation as sympathetic administrators who often ignored the commission's parsimonious relief guidelines to help people in desperate circumstances, and emphasized crime prevention in their policing duties.

The administrative role of the Rangers was much more signifi  cant than their policing work, particularly in Labrador. The commission established  six  detachments  there  between  1935  and  1936.  Newfoundland's  residents  had  an  array  of  government  representatives and offi  cials to communicate their interests to the government in St John's. Labradorians, who had no representation in the old House of Assembly, had relied mostly on voluntary and irregular representation by church offi  cials and philanthropists such as Grenfell to advocate for their needs. Now, the Rangers submitted to the government monthly,  quarterly,  and  semi-annual  reports  on  local  conditions there, just as they did for Newfoundland, while refl  ecting the will of the commission by being more sensitive to local concerns, especially in  the  enforcement  of  game  laws.  Regulations  such  as  the  opening and closing of hunting seasons were based on ecological conditions on the island. They needed a more fl  exible application to fi  t the needs of Labradorians. 4

The Commission of Government hoped that it could revitalize rural Newfoundland and diversify its economy through the development of model communities based on full-time commercial farming, thinking that such farming in centralized communities would have lower administrative costs. Markland, the fi  rst to be established (in 1934), is the most famous of these settlements, but the commission also sponsored eight  others.  They  began  as  attempts  to  reduce  some  of  the  poor's reliance on government assistance and were potentially imaginative attempts to introduce principles of cooperative living and production to rural Newfoundlanders. Two of the land settlements, Sandringham (Bonavista  Peninsula)  and  Winterland  (Burin  Peninsula),  benefi  ted from  better  agricultural  resources,  and  on  the  west  coast  Lourdes

thrived because settlers supplemented agriculture with fi  shing and logging.  Yet  the  policy  cost  the  commission  a  great  deal  of  money and the farms were not profi  table because the commission used its agricultural policy as an experiment in social engineering to eliminate denominationalism and reform the character of settlers. Although the commission had tried to introduce a more secular administration of the denominational school system in Newfoundland, it did not have the fi  nancial resources to engage in signifi  cant reform or the political support to challenge directly the churches' role in education. Similarly limited in what it might invest in the development of farming, the commission supported the Newfoundland Adult Education Association (NAEA), an organization dominated by J.L. Paton, the president of Memorial College in St John's, and W.W. Blackall, a member of the college's board of trustees. Committed to the notion that poverty resulted from moral failure and ignorance, the NAEA offered a form of self-help public education for the people who went to the new settlements. This education was short on practical advice, but long on middle-class exhortations that good Christian citizens dutifully did what they could to stay off public relief and away from political radicalism. The overall result was the failure of land settlement, much discontent among  the  settlements'  residents,  and  little  economic  opportunity that would draw people out of fi  shing communities. 5

The commission's social and administrative experiments did not improve the colonial economy, and the government lapsed into courting foreign capital while overlooking the well-being of industrial workers and their families. The commission had no interest, for example, in addressing the concerns of miners from St Lawrence, on the south coast of Newfoundland. In 1933, the New York capitalist Walter Seibert had proposed the development of a fl  uorspar mine there. Desperate for work, and with the local fi  shery in ruins after the 1929 tsunami, local people welcomed the development. However, Seibert imported cheap dry drills (banned in most other jurisdictions because of the dust they produced) for the miners to use. Working in deeper, poorly ventilated shafts, the miners had no protection from the dust, and had only contaminated water to drink, little safety equipment, and poor wages. During the early years of the commission, miners complained about conditions in the mine and occasionally refused to work unless they were paid better wages. Seibert's St Lawrence Corporation refused workers' demands, and the commission ordered local relief offi  cers to decline assistance to any miner who refused to work because of poor wages or conditions in the mines. The commission was so anxious to

## 214 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

attract investors that it did not want to alienate them by concerns about industrial safety, refusing to enforce 1908 legislation that established minimum working conditions in the mining industry. 6

The commission turned to land settlement and courted foreign capital because of social discontent about the inability of government to help those impoverished by the depression. In St John's, the Unemployed Committee demanded better government assistance for the poor  and  unemployed.  Pierce  Power,  an  unemployed  marine  fi  reman who was well liked and trusted by the working poor of the city, emerged as a leader of the group in 1934. Through powerful speeches and demonstrations, he rallied unemployed men and women, sometimes attracting as many as one thousand men, women, and children, which earned him surveillance as an agitator by the police. Throughout the city, petty theft, assaults, and property crime increased as the poor fought to put food in their mouths and roofs over their families' heads. The Unemployed Committee received little sympathy from the commission, but it continued to demand simple things such as more coal for the poor, cash instead of dole orders, clothing, and freedom from eviction. Power led marches on Government House, organized larger demonstrations, and, in 1935, threatened to hold a parade on 6 May, Jubilee Day, the king's birthday.

Although the commission agreed to provide some employment, it reneged on a promise to let the Unemployed Committee decide who needed it, arguing that the police should do so instead. This incensed the  unemployed,  who  gathered  in  protest  over  the  next  few  days, culminating in a riot on 10 May. Eventually, the police dispersed the crowds, dealing out severe beatings to Power and some of the other  Committee leaders. The beatings and subsequent trials of Pierce and other leaders broke the Committee's momentum. Pierce went to jail for fi  ve years for slashing the policeman who came to arrest him. Tired of police harassment, he had told the crowd that gathered at one meeting in 1935 that they had a right to dignity, that no one should be treated like a serf, and that 'We don't intend to die peacefully in a land of plenty.' Throughout Newfoundland, the working poor, especially loggers, continued to voice their discontent, and crowds continued to gather in protest against poverty and inadequate relief through the late 1930s. 7

Land settlement schemes and diversifi  cation in the form of mining failed to lessen rural Newfoundlanders' and Labradorians' dependence on the fi  shery and logging for work, and both remained troubled industries throughout the 1930s. The Rangers, otherwise busy with

overseeing the administration of model communities, outports, and other towns, served as a blunt instrument of the law during a loggers' strike at Deer Lake and Corner Brook in 1937. Although the commission's rhetoric suggested that it favoured trade unions, it was no more interested in confronting powerful companies than were the previous elected governments. Loggers took matters into their own hands by organizing a union, although the high unemployment of the depression made that diffi  cult. Not only did the companies take advantage of the shortage of work to dictate employment terms, but the logging camps were isolated from union organizers and the government officials who were supposed to enforce the labour code. The piecework system also tended to emphasize a competitive masculinity among loggers, which the companies encouraged by suggesting that a real man would have no trouble cutting enough wood to make a decent living. The seasonality of employment, and their tendency to log only during the winter because they fi  shed much of the year, meant that loggers' identifi  cation with the forestry industry was limited and unionization was diffi  cult.

Despite their divisions, loggers placed more faith in worker solidarity than in the commission's willingness to represent their interests. Many loggers bunked with relatives and familiar co-workers in the logging camps and developed a loyalty to each other. In 1935, loggers had rallied around a new union, the Newfoundland Lumberman's Association  (NLA) and its  leader  Joe  Thompson.  Thompson was a former logger from Point Leamington who had sons in the industry and who had organizational experience through service with the local Orange Lodge. He organized the NLA along lines similar to the FPU, retaining  tight  control  over  it  through  a  highly  centralized  leadership. By 1937, most loggers belonged to the NLA, which led successful strikes to improve wages and working conditions for log drivers working for the AND and IPP companies. The NLA was moderate. Thompson believed that loggers could rely only on themselves to be well represented in their struggles with employers but that those employers and employees should be able to accommodate each other reasonably. While committed to cooperation, the NLA found that the paper companies were not. Tensions within the loggers' movement led to a split in 1938 as loggers from the Corner Brook area formed the Newfoundland Labourers' Union, and those from the Deer Lake area formed the Workers' Central Protective Union. The NLA also faced hostility from the rump of the more conservative FPU, which saw itself as the only legitimate representative of outport people. 8

Loggers found little  support  from  the  skilled  workers  of  the  paper mills. The mill workers often saw any concession the loggers won from the mills as a threat to their own livelihoods, which they had improved through their own union struggles. Local 63 of the International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers, a union that represented the skilled workers at the AND mill in Grand Falls, went on strike against the company in 1921 when it laid off workers, reduced wages and hours of work, and stopped providing town families with free coal. The strike ended in a compromise, which refl  ected the paternalistic relationship between the union's members and the AND: the company restored hours and increased production but did not increase wages or restore the coal rights. By the 1930s, Grand Falls had established a stable labour force, kept relatively happy by company paternalism, which extended into the provision of good municipal and health services by colonial standards. As in Corner Brook, the paper companies encouraged the division between mill workers and woods workers by not allowing the unskilled workers to live in the companies' planned town sites, for example, and subsidizing social activities that created a sense of community among mill workers that was not shared with the more poorly paid outside workers.

The depression hurt the pulp and paper industry. At Corner Brook, for example, IPP's total value of exports to the United States fell from $9,100,000 in 1930 to $4,100,000 in 1935. The company responded by introducing wage and hours cuts that amounted to a 50 per cent reduction in mill workers' real earnings by 1933. Yet the IPP continued to provide its skilled workers with good housing, water and sewage, electricity, schools, and health facilities long before they were readily accessible in most logging towns or other rural communities. Nevertheless,  loggers  in  nearby  communities such as Lomond who were lucky enough to fi  nd work earned between $1.00 and $1.30 for every cord of wood they cut rather than the $2.50 per cord they had been getting. 9

The skilled workers of Grand Falls feared that the loggers and the itinerant  unemployed of the outports who might come looking for work in  their  town  would  erode  their  privileged  living  standards. Unemployed people from fi  shing outports usually coped with hard times by leaving Newfoundland to look for work elsewhere. With the depression,  emigration  from  Newfoundland  ceased,  because  there were no jobs to be had in the United States or Canada. By the 1930s, outport people turned more and more to places such as Grand Falls and Corner Brook for work. Men found work in logging and the pulp

and paper plants, but for women, domestic service was the main form of wage work available, while the daughters of mill workers got the small number of clerical, retail, and teaching jobs.

Some women from the outports had always hired out to perform domestic service for crews in the Labrador fi  shery or had gone abroad to work as servants. The poor state of the fi  shery encouraged outport people to move to the industrial towns to fi  nd work and young women to take positions with the families of managers and skilled workers in  Grand Falls and, later, Corner Brook. Other girls took service to supplement their families'  earnings  back  home.  Often  recruited  by kin and family friends who had managed to secure work in the mill towns, such domestic servants linked the household economies of the outports with the formal labour markets of the enclave towns and helped fi  shing families to survive by their remittances. 10

Usually marginalized in communities with few basic amenities outside of the pulp and paper towns, poorly paid and underemployed loggers were often slighted by their more skilled counterparts in the mills.  Feeling  displaced,  the  unskilled  labourers,  loggers,  and  their families found comfort, dignity, and hope in the relatively new Pentecostal  ministry  of  Newfoundland.  Pentecostalism  began  locally with the efforts of Alice Garrigus, the New Englander who came to St John's in 1910 and founded the Bethesda Mission on New Gower Street, in the heart of the working-class part of the city. As in the earlier experience of the Salvation Army, the Pentecostal missionaries faced public ridicule and harassment in their public activities, especially the baptism of converts in Mundy Pond. For ten years, the Pentecostal movement built slowly but gathered force after 1919 as disenchanted Methodists such as Robert C. English and Eugene Vaters turned to the more evangelical faith.

The movement attracted people who felt that the structure and hierarchy of the more established churches had little to offer the marginalized. The Pentecostal movement promised that the 'second blessing' of a personal, charismatic conversion made all people, regardless of gender, class, or ethnic difference, equal in their salvation. The fellowship of the faith gave poor people, such as the washerwoman Jessie Snow of Carbonear, who converted in the early 1920s, the strength to speak publicly and fearlessly in confrontation with the clerical elite of the other churches. Missionaries from Bethesda successfully established two missions at Humbermouth and Corner Brook West, just outside the Townsite, in 1925.

In the next year, missions spread rapidly eastward to Deer Lake and

Humber Canal, then to Grand Falls Station (later named Windsor) outside of Grand Falls, Springdale, Port Anson, Twillingate, Triton, Bishop's Falls, and Botwood. All of these towns were either homes to loggers or the unskilled labourers who serviced the needs of the pulp and paper industry. From these towns, Pentecostalism spread to the many smaller towns involved in the forestry sector and to mining towns, where workers experienced similar social problems. By 1935, 3,757 people of the Pentecostal faith were living in Newfoundland, of whom 2,278, or 61 per cent, were from White Bay, Green Bay, Grand Falls, Twillingate, Humber, and Harbour Main - Bell Island districts dominated by forestry  or  mining.  Many  of  the  rest  were  from  the working class in St John's and the larger centres of Conception Bay North. The early Pentecostal movement was an industrial, workingclass phenomenon, which began to spread quickly from towns such as Carbonear and Bay Roberts to coastal Labrador along the routes of the migratory cod fi  shery. 11

Skilled workers' unions hardly fared better than loggers in their relationships with the Commission of Government. A Local 63 dispute with the commission in 1935 had reinforced the local's organizer Alphonse Duggan's belief that individual unions required a Newfoundland  federation  to  bolster  their  infl  uence.  With  the  support  of  Ron Fahey and F.A.F. Lush of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) in St John's, Duggan had organized the pulp and paper unions, the  railway  brotherhoods,  and  the  Buchans  miners'  union  into  the Newfoundland Trades and Labour Council (NTLC) in 1937, renamed the Newfoundland Federation of Labour (NFL) by 1938. The NTLC wanted local unions to be more loyal to it than to the American Federation of Labor (AFL), the international union to which most of its members were affi  liated. With Duggan as its fi  rst president, the NTLC opted for a Newfoundland-fi  rst form of union organization and a reformist  approach  to  advocating  workers'  interests  with  employers and government. Besides promoting the organization of workers, the NTLC fought for a fi  ve-day, forty-hour work week, the abolition of child labour, an improved Workmen's Compensation Act, the creation of a pension plan for government employees, and improved inspection of mines.

To counter employers' accusations, the NTLC denied that any foreign infl  uence, such as that of the AFL or the more radical Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO), lay behind its work or that it supported socialism. In the late 1930s NTLC leaders, including Walter Sparks, who had recently organized railway clerks, and Irving Fogwill, organized

a range of St John's workers. Between 1937 and 1938 they organized or  rejuvenated fi  fteen  unions  and  added  four  thousand  new  members to the NTLC. Among these were retail and offi  ce clerks, carpenters, plumbers, pipefi  tters, metal workers, barbers, and workers in the clothing, food, beverage, tobacco, and cordage industries. The NTLC unionized city council workers, telephone operators and electricians with the Avalon Telephone Company, and city printers. They also unionized shop workers in Grand Falls, Corner Brook, Botwood, and Bishop's Falls. Three existing St John's unions also affi  liated with the NTLC: the Coopers' Union, the Bakery Workers' Protective Union, and the International Boot and Shoe Workers' Union. 12

The Commission of Government was unwilling to recognize workers' efforts to improve their lot by organizing, but it hardly proved effective in dealing with the social and economic problems that plagued Newfoundland  and  Labrador  during  the  depression.  The  government's efforts in public health care were yet another case in point. It replaced the Newfoundland Outport Nursing and Industrial Organization with government-paid nurses and funded a travelling clinic. The  commission  established  immunization  and  public  education plans to fi  ght tuberculosis, smallpox, diphtheria, and typhoid fever -  all  illnesses  to  which  the  malnourished  were  prone.  The  government nonetheless did little to address the poverty-induced malnutrition problem that underlay the worst of the public health problems facing Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.

The greatest public health innovation came from a private source: the  work  of  Dr  John  Olds,  an  American  trained  at  Johns  Hopkins Medical  School,  recruited  to  work  at  Twillingate  hospital  in  1929. Recognizing that the hospital's greatest challenge was malnutrition, Olds set up a baby clinic that gave mothers food and clothing as well as prenatal care education. He experimented with formulas of cod oil, brewers' yeast, and milk powder because of the high infant mortality rate among families that depended on the inadequate poor relief. Prompted by the Grenfell Mission and Olds's colleague Dr Charles Parsons, the commission had been forcing those on public relief to eat whole-wheat brown fl  our rather than white. People preferred white flour, which was both more palatable, rose properly when baked into the bread that was the staple of so many people's diets, and did not have the social stigma of 'relief fl  our.' Dr Olds recognized that the pre-depression diet was not particularly defi  cient, and that the commission's program was an insult. Not until 1938 did the commission follow Olds's strategy in targeting children by supplying them with

cocomalt,  a  vitamin-enriched  chocolate  drink  powder.  Olds  found that  the  commission was otherwise of little help to the outports in his area. Remarkably, the commission cut the operating grant of the Twillingate hospital in 1935. Rather than close the hospital, Olds developed a rudimentary health insurance plan whereby families paid $10 a year to ensure access to the hospital. 13

Although aware of the link between poverty and poor health, the commission was loath to assist the poor directly with public money, as with old-age pensions. The desire to lessen the fi  nancial burden of the pension plan actually predated the commission, for in 1930 the government had established a Royal Commission on Health and Public  Charities  that  recommended  means  testing  to  ensure  that  those who could be supported by families did not receive a pension. The commission's Department of Public Health and Welfare insisted on a stricter and more bureaucratic enforcement of means tests, although this remained limited by the small staff. While commission offi  cials harassed  pensioners  and  applicants  with  their  investigations,  they saved little money, while continuing to discriminate against women, refusing  pensions  to  unmarried  elderly  women  or  elderly  widows whose husbands had not collected a pension before they died. 14

Developments in Labrador and Europe provided the commission with other possibilities for social and economic development. From the administration's earliest days, Sir John Hope Simpson had taken a great interest in the economic potential of Labrador. He fi  rst visited North West River in 1934 and, by 1936, had energetically promoted forestry in the area around Alexis Bay, which became known as Port Hope Simpson. The commission also promoted mineral exploration, eventually giving the Weaver Coal Company mineral and water power rights for 50,000 square kilometres of the Labrador interior. Throughout the 1930s, the commission received proposals from agencies such as the Jewish Colonization Association and members of the local Jewish  community  for  the  large-scale  settlement  of  Jewish  refugees  in Newfoundland or, more usually, in Labrador. The ascent of Nazism in Germany and its expansion throughout central Europe had forced international Jewish organizations to fi  nd places that would welcome the thousands of European Jews who fl  ed. However, commission offi  cials worried about the supposed impracticality of large-scale settlements during a time of economic depression, feared opening a fl  oodgate of Jewish refugees, and preferred instead settlement by British or 'northern' Europeans. 15 The commission was refl  ecting the dominant view in the local press and the professional community.

By the late 1930s, the commission's social experimentation, moralizing, and parsimony had not revived Newfoundland and Labrador's economic fortunes. However, a practical and promising perspective came from J.H. Gorvin, who had been seconded from the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to work as an adviser on rural development for the commission in 1937. Gorvin recommended that the commission build on the existing strengths of coastal communities and believed  that  the  government  should  encourage  outport  families to maximize their use of inshore fi  shing and farming resources. He argued that rural reform would have to take place through the use of producer cooperatives, which would maximize the return to households rather than to merchants in the fi  shing industry. In the absence  of  other  labour-intensive  industrial  developments,  or  the possibility of out-migration, Gorvin wrote, government must do its best to encourage the informal economy of fi  shing communities, especially in supplementary farming, by which outport Newfoundlanders continued to fi  nd much of their own food stuffs. Gorvin became the commissioner of Natural Resources in 1939 and planned for the cooperative revitalization of the fi  shery and outport communities in his 1940 Act to Facilitate the Economic Development of Special Areas of Newfoundland. The act earned Gorvin the support of the NFL and colonial cooperative organizations, but also the enmity of many in the St John's business establishment, as well as the governor, Humphrey Thomas Walwyn. Walwyn had Gorvin recalled from Newfoundland in  1941,  effectively  ending  the  commission's  plans  for  rural  reconstruction. 16

Gorvin's fate as a commissioner is a reminder that, over the course of its operations, the Commission of Government experienced internal dissension and changes in its policy objectives. While the British-appointed commissioners occupied the most infl  uential portfolios, they could face opposition from their Newfoundland colleagues. Thomas Lodge, the British commissioner for Public Utilities in 1934, for example,  had  been,  with  Hope  Simpson,  the  enthusiast  behind  land settlements. He quickly acquired a dictatorial reputation among his Newfoundland colleagues, and Frederick Alderdice, who served as the commissioner for Education, opposed Lodge's desire to end denominational education. Frustrated with the practical realities of building consent for commission policies in Newfoundland, Lodge left in 1937. Although Gorvin was an exception, British offi  cials subsequently appointed commissioners who would carry out moderate economic reforms without ruffl  ing the feathers of Newfoundland's elites. 17

## 222 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

The Commission of Government was, however, willing to spend money on the moral reform of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians as  long  as  such  expenditures  involved  no  fundamental  restructuring of their economy. It put resources into the development of a state broadcasting system in 1939, when the commission bought and amalgamated three privately owned radio stations as the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland (BCN). The government planned to use the BCN to promote its policies and enhance the moral enlightenment of Newfoundland and Labrador, directing its efforts at what it perceived as the failings of a backward society dominated by a primitive inshore fi  shery and self-interested fi  sh merchants. Although the Amulree Commission had recommended sweeping reform of the fi  shing industry by the introduction of producer cooperatives, better-quality inspection, and the elimination of truck credit practices, the commission largely failed to follow through. Gorvin's dismissal revealed that, whatever its rhetoric, the commission was not going to stand up to powerful mercantile interests in St John's. The government did, however, give the Salt Codfi  sh Board authority to set minimum prices for exported fi  sh in 1934 and, in 1936, created the Newfoundland Fisheries Board. The board regulated all aspects of the production, processing, culling, inspection, and distribution of fi  sh, thus slowly bringing some order to merchants' marketing of fi  sh. Nonetheless, the commission did not want to intervene directly by rationalizing the many firms that competed with each other in the fi  shing industry. 18

Unable  to  improve  conditions  in  the  salt  fi  shery  signifi  cantly  in the  middle of the depression, the commission viewed the industry as  backward and espoused the notion that a fresh/frozen industry would  be  a  progressive  force,  stimulating  fi  sheries  modernization and  industrialization.  Local  mercantile  fi  rms,  however,  struggling with the depressed salt fi  sh trade, initially demonstrated little interest in risking capital in the new fresh/frozen sector, despite commissionsponsored education and research programs designed to promote industrialization. Fish merchants had a major currency problem: they conducted their business in devalued British pounds and had to sell their fi  sh in southern European, Caribbean, and Brazilian markets for currencies of unstable value. But increasingly they found that they had to purchase supplies for the fi  sh trade in more valuable American dollars. It was this, more than anything else, that eventually turned their interest to the factory-like production of larger offshore vessels and concentrated processing promoted by the commission. By the late 1930s, a number of fi  rms, such as John Penny and Sons, began to in-

vest in the new fi  shery, inspired by the American Clarence Birdseye's innovations in the process of quick-freezing fi  sh fi  llets and marketing of frozen foods in more lucrative North American consumer markets. Such tentative steps towards modernization, however, remained hampered by the commission's lack of fi  nancial resources to support extensive programs of assisted shipbuilding, or to provide funding for the fi  sheries science that would need to identify new fi  sh stocks for industrial exploitation. 19

Having done little to aid the fi  sh trade, the Commission of Government also accomplished little in forest management. Throughout its tenure, it complained about the supposed wasteful cutting practices of rural people, especially on the three-mile limit. As in the case of previous  administrations  under  responsible  government,  the  commission opposed the export of relatively unprocessed timber such as pit props for mines, although it continued the practice of allowing pit prop exports as a relief measure until 1937. Other than that, it established a national park, created demonstration sawmilling and logging operations, and started a forestry nursery on the Back River on the Avalon Peninsula, all of this to improve small-scale logging and sawmilling by rural people.

The real focus of the commission throughout the 1930s and 1940s was the industrial expansion of pulp and paper operations. Early on, the commission had hoped for a third pulp and paper complex on the Gander River, but the depression and limited wood supplies on the island frustrated this plan. With its American markets contracting because of the depression, the IPP at Corner Brook was approached by Bowaters, the major British buyer of its products. Bowaters was interested in taking over the operation to secure its paper supply and, if it could, more timber rights. The government agreed, allowing Bowaters the Gander timber limits that people had hoped would have supported a third paper mill. Bowaters took over the Corner Brook operation  in  1938  and  gained  control  over  three-mile  reserves  in southern White Bay and Canada Bay. Although the company's legal right to these reserves was questionable, local people supported the transfer of property rights to the private sector, hoping that Bowaters might provide employment to alleviate desperate local poverty.

With the help of generous government concessions, Bowaters made a lot of money in Newfoundland during the depression. It maintained paternalistic relationships with the skilled workers and businesspeople who lived and worked in Corner Brook, but had little sympathy for those beyond its boundaries. With the AND, Bowaters assumed

great infl  uence over forest policy. The pulp and paper companies had become so dominant in the area of forestry management that agencies  of  the  Commission of Government turned to them rather than the Department of Natural Resources for policy advice, and usually gave a sympathetic ear to company complaints about the supposedly wasteful cutting by coastal people on crown land. 20

The commission had demonstrated little real interest in confronting the fundamental social and economic problems that arose from the mercantile organization of the outport fi  shery during the fi  rst seven years of its existence. Its limited administrative reforms and its failure in almost every major social and economic initiative it undertook began to provoke public discontent. In July 1938, Governor Walwyn warned that the unemployed of St John's continued to become angrier and more inclined to a ''bolshie' spirit.' But everything changed with Britain's declaration of war on Germany on 3 September 1939, which automatically drew Newfoundland and Labrador into the conflict.  Through the Act for the Defence of Newfoundland (1939) and the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act (1940), the Commission of Government gained extensive powers to regulate society and economy for  the  war  effort.  It  quickly  organized  the  Newfoundland  Militia, which became the Newfoundland Regiment in 1943, as a defensive home guard, thus avoiding the expense of raising an overseas force. Instead,  over  3,400  Newfoundlanders and Labradorians enlisted in the Royal Navy, while 3,600 more joined the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit, from which many went on to branches of the British armed forces or the United Kingdom Home Guard. Others supported the war effort by serving as merchant mariners in the British and Allied shipping that proved vital to the war effort in Europe. While most Newfoundlanders and Labradorians saw military action on the North Atlantic or in the theatres of war in Europe, Africa, and Asia, hostilities occasionally struck close to home. German U-boats torpedoed ships at anchor at Bell Island in 1942, causing 69 casualties, while 137 passengers and crew died as a result of a torpedo attack on the Caribou , the ferry which linked North Sydney and Port aux Basques. 21

The strategic geographical position of Newfoundland and Labrador meant that it played a central role in the Allied war effort in the North Atlantic. Before the war, Newfoundland had already become important in the development of transatlantic fl  ight, especially at the Gander airport and the Botwood seaplane base. The Canadian government took over the defence of these facilities and later agreed to build additional airbases at Torbay and Goose Bay. The bases at Gander

and Goose Bay became vital links in the ferrying of military aircraft to Britain, while Torbay was home to fi  ghter squadrons that provided protection against U-boats for convoys of ships headed for Britain, although anti-U-boat patrols fl  ew from the other airbases as well. A Canadian naval base at St John's was the home for escort ships that sailed with these convoys. The Canadian government used its military presence  in  Newfoundland  to  assert  its  strategic  autonomy  within the Commonwealth and Allied war effort and bring Newfoundland into its sphere of infl  uence. Nevertheless, Canadian investment in its bases was often poorly planned and insuffi  cient for the operational requirements of the war effort. While Canadian naval forces based in St John's were crucial to the Allied cause in the Battle of the Atlantic, it was Canada's leading role in military aviation based in Torbay, Gander, and Goose Bay that made Newfoundland and Labrador so important to its emerging strategic position in the North Atlantic. 22

In 1940, Canada and the United States formed the Permanent Joint Board on Defence to protect the Western hemisphere. Although still offi  cially neutral, the United States leased an army base in St John's, an air base at Stephenville, and a naval and army base at Argentia in return for providing Britain with destroyers and military equipment. The Americans decided to build a naval air station and army base on the sites of the communities of Argentia and Marquise in Placentia Bay. The residents negotiated with American authorities and the commission to be relocated for the most part together in the nearby town of Freshwater. The huge workforce that built the base, about 1,500 Americans and 4,000 Newfoundland civilians, was a boon to the local economy despite the diffi  culties relocation had caused the original settlers in the area. A nearby anchorage proved signifi  cant in August 1941 as the site at which U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill agreed on the main points of the Atlantic Charter. Throughout 1940-1 the Americans also began construction on an airbase at Stephenville, on the west coast of Newfoundland. Over the next two years, about 1,500 civilians worked with American personnel on the construction of the base, which generated many of the same benefi  ts as at Argentia. 23

The construction of the Goose Bay airbase had the most profound social effect of all the military installations in Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1939, the Canadian government had begun to look for a site in Labrador that would serve as a place from which new aircraft could be fl  own to England and from which anti-submarine patrols could be launched. By 1941, the United States took the lead in identifying and

surveying the Goose Bay site. Under the auspices of the Permanent Joint Board on Defence, Canada leased the land and, with the Americans, built a huge base for the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force, and the U.S. Army Air Force. Between June and December 1941 the Allies had put temporary structures in place. By the end of the war, Goose Bay had a modern airport, port facilities, and all of the housing and other infrastructure necessary to support a population of about eight thousand people. Over time, the base brought together an unprecedented combination of Innu, Inuit, and settler peoples. 24

Military authorities relied on Labradorians for much of the labour required to build the base, and the Allies had agreed to hire local labour whenever possible. Although prices for fi  sh and furs had improved, work on the base was far more lucrative and, what is more, paid cash, thereby allowing many Labradorians to escape merchant credit and truck practices. Not allowed to live on the base, workers first went home, at the end of their shifts, to tent communities outside the restricted area, much like the shantytowns that developed on the edge of the Stephenville base. Workers and their families lived there, clustering together with others from their original communities, until the major Canadian contractor, McNamara Construction, built more permanent  housing.  Finally,  worries  about  potential  explosions  at nearby fuel storage tanks for the base forced their relocation to Happy Valley in 1943.

Labradorians  cleared  the  forest,  operated  sawmills,  and  then worked in the laundries to allow the base to operate. Whatever their ethnic background, people who had been used to seasonal and transhumant work in fi  shing and trapping found the industrial supervision of base work diffi  cult. Those from fi  shing communities would often leave to take up fi  shing again in the summer, to the frustration of military authorities and commission offi  cials, who felt they were better off with base employment. Nonetheless, the better wages and incomes of base work, which forced local employers such as the HBC to pay more as well, continued to attract people. Those who did not wish to live in Happy Valley often moved to nearby coastal communities such as Cartwright, where the Allies also constructed related military installations. 25

The construction and maintenance of such military infrastructure changed the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador. Thousands of local people found work for good wages during the construction phase of the bases. Many men and women continued to fi  nd employment in the operation of the bases once construction had been fi  n-

ished.  Wartime  demand  for  foodstuffs  led  to  improved  marketing conditions in the fi  shing industry. That said, economic problems partially offset the prosperity brought about by the military presence and revived fi  shery. Infl  ation and housing shortages, for example, were constant problems, especially in major centres, throughout the war, and conditions became so bad in St John's that the Commission of Government established a Commission of Enquiry into Housing and Town Planning in 1942. Based on its recommendations, the government, in cooperation with the City of St John's, began a program of suburban housing development at Churchill Park for working people who could afford to buy a house; they were not, however, interested in providing public housing for the working poor. 26

The  arrival  of  military  personnel,  the  overseas  service  of  Newfoundland and Labrador men, the movement of local people to take work on the bases, and the marriages and other relationships that developed between local people and military personnel strained family relationships. While most Newfoundlanders and Labradorians might separate legally, there was no legal basis for divorce in the dominion, and few had the means to resort to other jurisdictions where divorce might be granted. Throughout the war years, the commission faced increasing popular demands for the legal right of divorce. While Justice Brian Dunfi  eld ruled in 1948 that the Newfoundland courts had the  power to administer judicial separation, Newfoundlanders and Labradorians did not gain the legal right of divorce until they became Canadians in 1949. The presence of large numbers of military personnel created other social problems. Whether in Gander, St John's, or Goose Bay, the military brought or encouraged the development of  entertainment  facilities  for  troops,  which  local  people  attended. American  authorities  particularly  worried  that  relationships  with local women would leave American soldiers with venereal diseases (VD) and other health problems, little considering that these soldiers might leave local women with the same problems. Military authorities pressed the Commission of Government to institute public health campaigns, to take aggressive measures against VD, and to prosecute more vigorously people suspected of prostitution. 27

The presence of so many Canadians and Americans, along with their entertainment  and  consumer  goods,  gave  many  Newfoundlanders and Labradorians a taste for the more affl  uent consumerism that had been developing throughout North America. The wartime economy also provided the Commission of Government with the resources to spend  more  public  money  on  health,  education,  and  housing.  The

commission further invested in transportation and other public infrastructure. Nonetheless, it recognized that wartime prosperity was unlikely to last long once the war was over. With British support, the Commission of Government had pressured American authorities to keep  wage  rates  down,  suspecting  that  better  wages  would  draw workers from the mining and forestry sectors. Many people participating  in  the  commission's  resettlement  schemes  had  abandoned their new homes for work on the bases, leading the government to fear  that  the  local  postwar  labour  market  would  be  unable  to  provide Newfoundlanders and Labradorians with the same type of wellpaid jobs as had the bases. Not surprisingly, when Newfoundlanders learned they were being paid more poorly than foreign workers for the same jobs, word leaked out that the commission intentionally held the wages down. Further, since the bases were sovereign American territory, Newfoundlanders could be detained by the military police for attempting to unionize their countrymen, making collective bargaining impossible. 28

Although  the  commission  was  unwilling  to  concede  to  labour leaders'  demands  that  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  labourers  on the bases be better paid, the war effort gave workers more infl  uence, and the organized labour movement achieved limited but important goals. At St Lawrence, for example, miners had continued to press for improved working conditions. In 1939, amid an outbreak of illness likely caused by workers drinking water contaminated by the mining process, miners formed the St Lawrence Labourers Protective Union (SLLPU). Although the SLLPU immediately demanded that the government address health and safety issues in the mines, the government did little, while the company offered a 10 per cent wage increase. Already important in steel  manufacture,  fl  uorspar  was  essential  to the manufacture of aluminum. The Canadian manufacturer Alcan established another mine in St Lawrence in the same year, and its employees boosted the SLLPU membership. By 1940, SLLPU members walked off the job at the St Lawrence Corporation. Facing renewed union activity throughout the dominion, and fearing that labour unrest would disrupt the war effort, the commission gave itself the power to intervene in labour disputes. Rather than acting right away, the commission asked local magistrates to hold an inquiry into workers' complaints. The inquiry found that miners and their families continued to live in appalling poverty and unhealthy conditions without adequate medical services. It took greater militancy by the union, reorganized as the St Lawrence Workers Protective Union (SLWPU) in 1941, along

with strikes elsewhere in Newfoundland, to force the government to act. In the fall, the commission established a Trade Disputes Board, which recommended the next year that the mining companies would have to recognize and bargain collectively with the SLWPU. Although workers brought their health and safety concerns to the board, it recommended nothing. The union, caught up in the early process of collective bargaining, did not pursue the issue. Their safety neglected by their employer, and their interests hardly regarded by their government, the miners of St Lawrence along with their wives and neighbours and people from the nearby community of Lawn, heroically answered the call of basic human decency on 18 February 1942, when they rescued crew members from the American warships USS Truxton and Pollux ,  which had run aground on the nearby coast in bad weather. While 93 members of the Pollux 's crew perished, local people rescued 140 others. Only 46 of the Truxton 's 146 lived to tell their tales, which included stories of the hard work and generosity exhibited by the people of St Lawrence and Lawn in caring for them. 29

Throughout  the  war,  the  organized  labour  movement  generally had avoided confrontation with either government or employers for the sake of the war effort. Pleased with the cooperation, the commission appointed representatives from the labour movement to advisory committees, including the New Industries Board, the War Loans Committee, the Unemployment Assistance Committee, and eventually the Advisory Committee to the Cabinet on Demobilization and Economic Readjustment. The Commission of Government had originally established the Trade Disputes Board with the Strikes and Lockouts Board and the Woods Labour Board to impose settlements and to ensure labour peace in the crucial pulp and paper and mining industries. The boards acted only when collective bargaining could not resolve disputes but gave members of labour unions an opportunity to acquire bargaining experience without worrying about strikes or lockouts. The touchstone for these developments had been a strike by miners at the Buchans Mining Company Limited for better wages. The miners walked off the job without the consent of their leaders in the Buchans Workers Protective Union, refused to be bullied by a police squad sent to Buchans, and demanded that the Trade Disputes Board investigate. The board recommended a wage increase and a contract provision for cost-of-living  increases.  The  board  further  demanded that the employer recognize and bargain with the union. The commission used the Buchans decision as a template for further industrial disputes throughout the war. 30

Wartime employment and the fl  ood of cash into the local economy, combined with rising prices for fi  sh as the war progressed, eroded most of the old credit practices associated with truck. The Rangers dealt less with public relief and more with social problems often related to the transience required by base construction. Outport communities changed as large numbers of strangers moved throughout the  dominion,  and  older  community  leaders  found  their  infl  uence waning in the shadow of a new consumerism arising from integration into the cash economy. The Rangers found that their new duties of enforcing wartime price controls and rationing made them unpopular. People who had suffered through the depression wanted a little sugar or other luxury items now that they had some spare cash after years of privation. Rangers were not only responsible for the registration of all men fi  t for service, but had to enforce school attendance in line with the School Attendance Act of 1942, which required that all children up to the age of fourteen attend school. Many families disliked this regulation because their fi  sheries and farms depended on the help of all family members, whether one was younger than fourteen or not. By the end of the war, the Rangers found that their policing duties had increased. 31

High fi  sh prices revived the household fi  shery during the Second World  War,  but  market  and  currency  problems  in  the  immediate postwar period led to a dramatic restructuring of the industry. Once the war ended, and prices began to collapse, the commission was content to allow a group of private interests to respond by forming the Newfoundland Associated Fish Exporters Limited (NAFEL) in 1945, which had the sole right to export fi  sh from Newfoundland. NAFEL was itself a nonprofi  t organization that used 10 per cent of its sales to cover costs but otherwise returned the remainder of the proceeds to its members, who had to guarantee the delivery of a good-quality product. As a private marketing organization, however, NAFEL had no mandate to develop markets for new products, new markets for old ones, or to reform production. The commission had never hired any personnel with much direct experience in the marketing of fi  sh, much less in processing, and NAFEL's practice of marketing fi  sh by consignment now meant that those individual fi  rms that had always produced for particular markets would not know whether their fi  sh would go to these same markets. As a result, there was even less incentive to cure carefully, and, without the power to establish standardized production, NAFEL could do nothing to improve quality. As European  competitors  resumed  fi  shing,  Britain's  postwar  currency

problems plagued Newfoundland fi  rms, whose traditional markets in southern Europe had paid for fi  sh in the British pounds sterling, which were then converted to dollars to pay for Newfoundland's imports from the United States and Canada. With the devaluation of the pound sterling at the end of the war, however, the British government prohibited  its  conversion  to  American  dollars  and  Newfoundland found itself short of dollars to pay for imports while holding pounds in accounts in Britain that could not be transferred. 32

The commission believed that persistent poverty in the fi  shery was the result of rural dependence for earnings on producing low-value, salted  fi  sh  that  could  only  be  sold  in  poor  southern  European  and South American markets. However, a long process of ruinous competition  among  the  merchants  who  marketed  fi  sh  had  meant  that Newfoundland salt fi  sh had a poor reputation in the marketplace as a hurriedly processed and poorly shipped product. Lower prices, of course, followed declining reputation, and merchants responded by cutting the credit they gave to fi  shing households. Continuing merchant opposition to salt fi  sh marketing reform left the commission encouraging a fresh/frozen fi  shery on the part of a few new companies: in effect, a complete modernization of the fi  shery. 33

The  plan  followed  one  developed  by  Canadian  fi  sheries  offi  cial Stewart  Bates  in  1944  to  cope  with  similar  marketing  problems  in Nova Scotia. Bates suggested restructuring the fi  shing industry along more  capital-intensive  lines,  replacing  independent  fi  sh  merchant firms  that  exported  salt  fi  sh  produced  by  family  labour  with  large fishing corporations that could standardize processing and export to more lucrative fresh/frozen markets in the United States. The new industry would be based largely on wage labour employed on large deep-sea trawlers that supplied processing plants concentrated in a small number of communities. Large vessels could stay at sea for up to two weeks, catching fi  sh by towing large nets from their sides or, later,  from  their  sterns.  Bates  suggested  that  frozen  fi  sh  processors should take control over the whole process of production, from catching fi  sh to selling it in the market, thus allowing processors to freeze excess  catches  and  store  product  to  await  higher  demand.  A  more effi  cient  process  of  moving fi  sh from the water to the dinner plate, he thought, would stabilize the old problems of uncertainties in the availability of the resource and in markets.

Although  the  Bates  plan  had  been  developed  for  a  Nova  Scotia economy that was more diversifi  ed than Newfoundland's, and could therefore absorb some of the household labour made surplus by the

intensive  capitalization  of  the  industry,  the  atypical  success  of  the wartime era  fooled  the  commission  into  thinking  that  Bates's  plan would work for the island, and it embraced fi  sheries modernization as the cornerstone of a policy designed to bring to a close the outport life of Newfoundland. 34

While many people criticized the commission for its failures to resolve the economic problems facing Newfoundland, some now became frustrated by the lack of democratic institutions within which to resolve problems. Nationalistic Newfoundlanders turned to other avenues,  among  them  F.M.  O'Leary,  who  sponsored  the  journalist,  former  labour  organizer,  self-professed  Christian  Socialist,  and Squires Liberal supporter Joseph Smallwood's Barrelman radio program. Smallwood had tried to bolster Newfoundlanders' confi  dence in the face of the depression and became a popular radio personality.  In  1943  he  left  the  program,  suggesting  that  Newfoundlanders now had their confi  dence back, and moved to the Royal Canadian Air Force base at Gander to operate a pig farm. Smallwood's interest in farming was long-standing, and he probably drew some inspiration for it from the efforts of his political heroes, the Reformers of the nineteenth century such as William Carson, to establish an alternative to living from the sea. 35

Other discontent with the commission was also making itself felt. Although the relative absence of industrial strife during the war enhanced the reputation of the NFL and its affi  liates, there was growing frustration within the labour movement about the manner in which war-induced infl  ation was eroding workers' wages. Workers in the building trades were particularly sensitive because of the manner in which the commission had discouraged the Americans and Canadians from paying wages equal to what they might pay their own nationals  for  work  in  base  construction.  Cash-strapped,  the  NFL  had not been organizing such workers, some of whom formed their own union with Harold Horwood as leader. Horwood enlisted the aid of Greg Power to organize the General Workers' Union at the Argentia military base, where he led a successful fi  ght for union recognition and pay increases by waging a public and embarrassing campaign against American authorities there.

With the end of the war, the NFL decided that it was time to renew its organizing efforts and to fi  ght for better wages for working people who had been plagued by infl  ation. It hired Horwood as a part-time organizer but suspended him in 1947 because his leftist radicalism did not fi  t  with  the  NFL's  desire  for  public  respectability.  Nonetheless,

the NFL initiated a successful union drive that, by 1947, meant Newfoundland had, on a per capita basis, twice as many organized workers as had Canada. In 1948, the NFL, with the support of the LSPU, backed a successful strike by railway workers for a wage increase. As almost all consumer goods were shipped by rail or sea, the cooperation of longshoremen and railway workers meant that food shortages and economic disruption reigned outside of St John's, which was the main port of entry for most imports. Without violence and with the cooperation of the labour movement, the railway workers forced the Commission of Government to give in to their demands. The NFL had hoped that the commission would introduce a labour relations act but recognized that it would have to wait for a return of responsible government. Leading members of the NFL, such as Irving Fogwill, had already turned to the only democratic politics left in Newfoundland, St John's municipal elections. They formed the St John's District Labour Party in 1945 and ran unsuccessfully in the municipal election of that year. 36

The demands for a return to responsible government were going to be diffi  cult to resist, but Clement Atlee, the Dominions Secretary in 1942, believed that Newfoundland would be better off joining Canada. He sent a delegation of three MPs to Newfoundland in 1943, which found that few people wanted Confederation, but they also were unhappy at the prospect of returning to responsible government as it had existed in 1932. The United States emerged from the war as the world's pre-eminent power that was on the eve of a struggle with the Soviet Union. Newfoundland and Labrador continued to be vital strategically to American interests in the North Atlantic, since the nature of its military leases meant that the United States had a suffi  cient presence there to protect its interests. The Canadian government, on the other hand, decided that bringing Newfoundland and Labrador into Confederation would be the best way of securing its interests in civil  aviation  and  defence.  Canada now stood in the shadow of its American partner; with Britain, it recognized the potential of friendly counter-balancing American hegemony if Newfoundland and Labrador  became  a  province.  British  offi  cials  proposed,  but  ultimately rejected  as  expensive,  a  postwar  economic  reconstruction  plan  for Newfoundland. Canadian offi  cials opposed the plan because it would make Newfoundland more viable as an independent dominion and therefore  unlikely  to  join  Confederation.  The  British  and  Canadian governments decided to bring Newfoundland into Confederation. 37

The Commission of Government realized that the experience of war

## 234 Newfoundland and Labrador: A History

would lead to demands for change once peace arrived. Before the war, the unemployed, loggers, miners, and unionists had begun to rally against the commission's ineffectual and stingy social and economic policies. During the war, Newfoundlanders and Labradorians felt that they had done their part to defend democracy from fascism. Yet, these same people continued to be administered by an often unpopular and unelected government. At the international level, the Second World War had cost Britain dearly; it would be unable to maintain its prewar imperial commitments, including its support for the commission in Newfoundland. Although Newfoundland's books were balanced, fulfi  lling  one  of  the  conditions under which self-government might be resumed, the commissioners believed fi  nancial solvency was a result of abnormal wartime conditions. Newfoundland and British authorities  realized  that  the  commission's  efforts  to  reform  the  moral character of Newfoundland had been futile, that it had been unable to bring about signifi  cant economic reorganization, and that war had been the real catalyst for change. With war at an end, working people expected meaningful social and economic change. J.R. Smallwood's campaign for Confederation appeared to be the best way they might realize their hopes.

## The Land of Milk and Honey, 1946-1972

Herbert Pottle, one of the fi  rst  of  Smallwood's  cabinet  ministers  to abandon him, wrote that Smallwood saw himself as the people's 'Abraham' leading them into the 'new Canaan' of Confederation, but with a common touch: he was the prophet 'of the average 'Joe.'' 1 Smallwood appealed to the fi  shing people and loggers who comprised the bulk of the outport population, leading them to believe that he would stand up against the merchants of Water Street. Smallwood promised them better lives, but under his government the newest province of Canada experienced increased dependency on federal transfer payments and the courtship of big business to aid in natural-resource development. Smallwood's goal was to transform the province into a modern urban and industrial society dominated by consumerism. Over the long term, the milk and honey of Confederation soured as workers' clashes with Smallwood and his obtuse economic vision for the province and the area's dependency on the fragile resources of the welfare state all took their toll. Newfoundland and Labrador's experience as a Canadian province would not live up to the inchoate but real hope on the part of many Newfoundlanders and Labradorians that constitutional change might fundamentally alter the economic exploitation that they had endured for so long and maintain the greater personal economic autonomy that had come with war-related employment.

The British government and the Commission of Government in St John's decided to use an elected National Convention on Newfoundland's  constitutional  future,  established  in  1946,  to  promote  union with Canada. Although opponents of the commission and Confed-

eration argued, with some justifi  cation, that the British government should have restored full responsible government instead, there was little popular hue and cry against the National Convention. Most of the Convention's delegates felt that self-government should resume, but they took up the task of investigating the general state of affairs. A recent convert to the cause of Confederation, Smallwood was unshakeable in his commitment to it. Infl  uenced by his youthful fl  irtation with the political left and the crushing poverty of the depression, Smallwood  believed  that  union  with  Canada  would  shift  the  balance in favour of working Newfoundlanders, especially those of the outports, against the dominion's mercantile elite, concentrated in St John's. In his earlier Barrelman broadcasts, Smallwood had suggested that ordinary people were hard-working members of a Newfoundland nation, with the same entitlements to modern living standards and consumerism as anyone, merchants included. If such ordinary people could not marshal the resources to obtain their rights in an independent Newfoundland, then it was better to join Canada. 2

Although Smallwood had distanced himself from the left, it is impossible to escape the class dimensions implicit in his message of consumer entitlement and in the nature of the team he assembled to fi  ght for Confederation. His most important ally was F. Gordon Bradley, who had retired from the bar and moved to Bonavista in the mid1930s, partially out of disgust with the St John's elite, who had paved the  way for  the  Amulree  Commission's recommendations. Bradley had long believed in the necessity of Confederation and wrote periodically about political matters for the FPU newspaper, the Fisherman's Advocate .  Smallwood recruited a young, dynamic group, the fi  rst of whom was the self-described 'left-wing socialist,' Harold Horwood. Horwood  claimed  that  he  and  Smallwood  counted  'card-carrying communists' among their friends and that Smallwood professed that he wanted to bring socialism to Newfoundland in the fi  ght for union with Canada. Horwood's colleague in the labour movement and local literary circles, W. Irving Fogwill, along with his wife Janet Fogwill, joined him in supporting Confederation. Another self-proclaimed socialist, Phil Forsey, supported them, as did Greg Power. A talented writer as well, Power became a close friend of Smallwood and the most important writer for the Confederate , the newspaper of the Newfoundland Confederate Association. 3

Some  leaders  from  the  labour  movement  worked  against  Confederation, most notably Frank Fogwill. He had been elected to the National Convention as a labour candidate for St John's East Extern

and supported Peter Cashin's fi  ght for a return to responsible government. Although a fi  rebrand, Cashin was unable to put together a convincing platform for a return to responsible government or to rally a party to his cause. In 1947, St John's business interests and professionals came together in a Responsible Government League (RGL), led by F.M. O'Leary. The RGL relied heavily on the notion that Newfoundlanders would not want to sell their nation to Canada or live under the yoke of Canadian taxation. Although Smallwood had failed in 1946 in a motion to send a delegation of the Convention to Ottawa to investigate possible terms of union with Canada, he used public broadcast of the debate to extol the benefi  ts of Confederation and to ask Newfoundlanders if they really wished to return to responsible government and the poverty of the 1930s. In 1947, the Convention agreed to send delegations to Ottawa and London.

Ottawa offi  cials agreed that if Newfoundland became a province, Canada would assume 90 per cent of its public debt, allow it to retain its accumulated surplus of $28.8 million, provide it with statutory subsidies and transitional grants until the new province had phased in its own provincial taxes, establish a royal commission within eight years to  review  the  province's  fi  nancial  position;  they  also  made  concessions to Newfoundland's right to manufacture margarine and have a public denominational education system. The management of landbased natural resources would fall under provincial jurisdiction as provided in the British North America Act. However, management of fisheries would fall under federal jurisdiction, although the Canadian government agreed that NAFEL would continue to have exclusive rights to market Newfoundland and Labrador fi  sh, which lasted until 1959. 4 The  London delegation, on the other hand, came away with little more than a promise that Britain would continue to support the Commission of Government fi  nancially if Newfoundlanders decided that it should continue.

In the Convention, the RGL had the support of enough delegates to ensure that only Commission of Government and 'Responsible Government as it existed in 1933' would be on the ballot for a national referendum  on  the  constitutional  future  of  Newfoundland.  Smallwood quickly organized a petition demanding that Confederation be added to the ballot as well, something which the British were happy to grant. The RGL had focused its attention upon preventing the people of Newfoundland and Labrador from having such an option and was now ill prepared to meet Smallwood's head start in convincing people  to  vote.  In  desperation,  younger  anti-Confederates  formed

the Economic Union Association (EUA) and recruited businessman Chesley Crosbie as its leader. The commission would not allow the Convention to travel to Washington to inquire about closer economic ties to the United States, ruling that such discussions were a matter of foreign affairs and not a form of government. Poorly organized and funded, the RGL and the EUA divided the responsible government campaign and could not escape the tarnish that they represented Water Street, although most of the country's business elite were ambivalent about the referendum outcome. 5

The fi  rst referendum in June 1948 resulted in no form of government getting a majority, although responsible government gained the most votes. The commission dropped the option of continuing under Commission of Government and campaigning resumed before a second ballot. The campaign assumed sectarian tones as Archbishop Edward Patrick Roche advised Roman Catholics to vote against Confederation. His arguments were essentially the same as those of the RGL, yet his greatest fear was that Confederation could undermine denominational education in Newfoundland. Although there is little evidence to suggest that most Roman Catholics took political direction from Roche, Smallwood mobilized the Orange Order to support the Confederation cause. Although mean-spirited, this sectarianism little affected the referendum. The majority of those who had favoured continued commission appear to have backed Confederation in July, resulting in a slim majority for union with Canada.

The results refl  ected a remarkable division within Newfoundland society.  Most  voters  on  the  Avalon  Peninsula  favoured  a  return  to responsible government while the remainder of the island and Labrador supported Confederation. Sectarianism may have contributed to the division, but other factors played a major role. Exposed daily  to  the  anxieties  expressed  in  the  media  of  many  in  the  business community about the possible economic problems of Confederation, people on the Avalon Peninsula, regardless of denomination, were disposed against Confederation. Smallwood had used an anti-Water Street sentiment to good effect, however, portraying Confederation as a way for the powerless in rural Newfoundland to get out from under a plutocratic merchant-dominated political and economic system that gave them only poverty and want. In the districts of Humber and Grand Falls, pulp and paper companies were opposed to Confederation because they did not want to come under a more exacting federal taxation regime; this opposition probably encouraged loggers to support Smallwood. In St George's-Port au Port, voters of the mostly

Roman  Catholic  district  supported  Confederation.  Although  some analyses suggest these Catholics (Acadians, Scottish Highlanders, or Mi'kmaq from Cape Breton in origin) did so because of their Canadian connections, W.J. Chafe, who had been working for the Newfoundland railway at St George's, remembered that 'the American base at Stephenville had given the people a taste for North American prosperity,' which they hoped to preserve through union with Canada. 6

Smallwood and the Confederate Association had convinced rural Newfoundlanders and Labradorians that their best hope for a better life lay in Canadian-funded transfer payments through family allowances, pensions, unemployment insurance, and other programs. Despite efforts to block the union, it became effective one moment before midnight on 31 March 1949, to avoid the symbolism of joining as the tenth province on April Fool's Day. The Canadian government, however, had intended that the Terms of Union would bring Newfoundland up to the standards of the Maritime Provinces, which had found Confederation to be more than a little disappointing in terms of economic development. The new provincial government would be hard pressed to use the terms of its union with Canada to fundamentally restructure the social inequalities of Newfoundland and Labrador. Apparently generous fi  nancially at the time, the Terms of Union had not been designed to make Newfoundland and Labrador better off than its neighbouring provinces. 7

Smallwood capitalized on the localism of class relationships in fi  shing  communities  by  building  the  campaign  for  Confederation  as  a way for outport people to strike at St John's merchants. The paternalism of outport culture meant that fi  shing people often continued to  identify  with  their  local  merchants  against  'Water  Street.'  Local dealers and merchants had been hurt by St John's fi  rms' restriction of credit during the 1930s. Outport fi  rms had further borne much of the strain of supplying their clients with more expensive products from St John's under the shelter of protective tariffs. Wartime prosperity had meant that many small fi  rms concentrated more on the business of satisfying the consumer demands of local people. Although military spending had been reduced, government spending and the appearance of the fi  rst fi  sh plants on the south coast provided fi  shing people with cash and encouraged merchants and shopkeepers to compete for their business. Such businesses would deal with St John's wholesalers when they could obtain affordable supplies, but by the early 1950s they turned to Canadian suppliers to procure goods at the best prices possible for their rural customers. When a small outport merchant,

therefore, wrote to the St John's fi  rm of F.M. O'Leary just after Confederation to gloat as he closed out his account because he planned to buy in future from Canadian suppliers, we can too easily regard the complex class antagonisms expressed in his message as a regional divide. 8

In the long run, Smallwood and his allies had no intention of alienating  capitalists  regardless  of  the  size  of  their  interests.  Instead, they quickly adopted the Liberal mantle, partly because that party was in power in Ottawa and partly because the federal Liberals were ideologically  compatible  with  Smallwood's  modernization  agenda. Smallwood's early socialism paled beside his political involvement in the Liberal Party of Richard Squires, and he supported the same type of industrialization as had Squires. This left the anti-Confederates to join the Progressive Conservative Party, contaminating it with their reputation as opponents of Confederation and its accompanying social programs. During succeeding elections the Progressive Conservatives were unable to elect members of the House of Assembly outside of the anti-Confederate pocket on the Avalon Peninsula.

Smallwood always had his eye upon the partisan implications of everything his government and the federal government did. He had promised better old-age pensions, for example, which the federal government could use to quickly demonstrate, with hard cash, the material benefi  ts of being Canadian. Despite federal offi  cials' hope that they might have some time to establish their normal procedures, including a process of verifying ages, provincial minister Herbert Pottle advised Newfoundlanders to start fl  ooding federal offi  cials with applications to get a head start on establishing their eligibility. Smallwood wanted happy voters with pension and family allowance cheques in hand to support his Liberal Party in the fi  rst provincial election. He was even more blatant upon other occasions, as when he threatened the voters of Ferryland District that if they did not elect Liberal Greg Power he would ensure they would get 'not one red cent' of federal money until the next election. Over the next few years Smallwood's close connection to federal Liberal insider Jack Pickersgill helped the premier claim credit for federal programs. 9

Smallwood  retained  an  antipathy  toward  Newfoundland's  economic elite when they seemed to be an obstacle to modernization and often viewed them in terms of the old Reformers' notions of parasitic merchants from the 1820s and 1830s. He hoped to enlist the federal government and international capital to help him transform the province's society and economy. Canadian offi  cials encouraged moderni-

zation of the fi  shery  after  1949,  and  Smallwood  embraced the idea that persistent poverty in the fi  shery was the result of rural dependence for earnings on producing low-value, salted fi  sh that could only be sold in poor southern European and South American markets. He agreed that ruinous competition among fi  sh merchants made matters worse.  A  complete  reorganization  of  the  fi  shery,  removing  the  old household-based salt fi  shery, seemed best.

Smallwood's government supported the modernization of the fi  shery, believing it could use federal money to build a diversifi  ed economy. He assumed that outport fi  shing people wanted to get out of not only the poverty that dominated their lives but also the insecurity and risk associated with independent household production in the fi  shery, and he wanted Newfoundlanders to join the 'modern world' by leaving the outports for wage work in the designated growth centres. The federal and provincial governments expected that any remaining inshore fi  shing communities would disappear as they encouraged the fishery  to  become  more  capital-intensive,  mechanized,  and  centralized in a few urban communities. 10

Smallwood did not have a clear plan or vision for the new Newfoundland he wanted to build, just a vague sense that people wanted secure full-time jobs in a modern, urban, industrial society. His government embarked on a disastrous program of industrial diversifi  cation that failed to provide employment to those fi  shers who were displaced by fi  sheries modernization; his attempted industrial diversifi  cation  of  the  provincial  economy  resulted  in  a  lot  of  ill-advised manufacturing failures and political chicanery. Smallwood believed that 'Water Street' was too short-sighted to take on industrial projects and hoped to use the accumulated surplus of the commission years as seed money to entice outside capitalists to bring their expertise and new industries to Newfoundland and Labrador.

To spearhead this plan he recruited Alfred Valdmanis, the former Latvian fi  nance minister and wartime resident of Germany, as Newfoundland's  director  of  economic  development.  Smallwood  was impressed  with  Valdmanis's  drive  and  energy  and  hoped  that  the former collaborator's contacts with German industrialists might allow his government to entice entrepreneurs from war-ravaged Germany to set up shop in Newfoundland. Valdmanis helped establish the successful North Star Cement factory in Corner Brook, but subsequent efforts such as knitting mills, confectionary factories, and fi  lm production were ill-suited to an economy that had few alternatives to marine resources and a small local market for consumer products, for

which local manufacturers had already lost their market protection when Newfoundland became a Canadian province. 11

The Smallwood government had passed the province's fi  rst Revenue and Audit Act in 1952, which created a treasury board as a committee of cabinet and put in place a relatively independent auditor general. Nevertheless, the auditor general did not report to the legislature, and Smallwood was loath to allow the offi  ce to challenge his administration's  often  questionable  expenditures.  The  government quickly dissipated its surplus in subsidies to businesses that never got off the ground. Under Valdmanis's direction, the Newfoundland government courted foreign investment by providing 50 per cent of the start-up capital for new industries through various forms of public financing. In return, private investors were obliged to provide the rest of the capital but could do so in-kind. Some German businessmen felt they had been lied to about Newfoundland's economic suitability for their businesses, while many Newfoundlanders believed that foreign con  artists  had  taken  money  from  the  gullible  Smallwood  without ever intending to establish viable businesses, not least because Smallwood had inadvertently encouraged many Newfoundland politicians to be jealous of Valdmanis, on whom he depended. In 1954 Valdmanis entered a guilty plea to the charge of accepting bribes from German industrialists who were looking for government concessions. 12

With  the  Valdmanis  experience  ending  in  disgrace,  Smallwood continued to face a dilemma. His vision of a modern Newfoundland was twofold. First, he wanted to improve provincial living standards by increasing the population's ability to consume private goods and public services.  Second,  he  wanted  to  build  an  industrial  economy that would support such expanded consumption. In the short term, Smallwood made rapid strides  in  the  fi  rst  agenda  through  federal welfare-state  and  transfer  programs.  The  provincial  government quickly expanded Memorial University from a junior college to a degree-granting  institution  and  embarked  on  an  aggressive  program to build roads, schools, and hospitals during the 1950s. The government had failed, however, to generate signifi  cant industrial employment, especially in rural areas. Unsuccessful industrial development schemes drained the surplus left over from the Commission of Government and left the province without a tax base to generate revenue for government services.

Rural people were beginning to suspect that Smallwood might have been a false prophet. Loggers from communities in White Bay had already discovered that the premier favoured the large pulp and paper

companies over them in the allocation of forest resources. Throughout the early 1950s the provincial government refused to return control of a portion of the three-mile limit of coastal forest to White Bay communities, despite support from their Liberal MHA, Sam Drover, and Ted Russell, who had been the minister of Mines and Resources. 13 Finally, in 1954, persistent complaints about the forestry industry led the government to appoint a royal commission on forestry, which recommended the management of crown timber resources for the benefi  t of large-scale industrial development of the woods.

Feeling that the Liberal government no longer represented the best interests of his constituents, White Bay MHA Sam Drover crossed the floor, eventually sitting as the Assembly's fi  rst member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). Ted Russell, who had supported Smallwood during the fi  ght for Confederation, had already left cabinet in 1951 over the development policies recommended by Valdmanis;  Horwood  and  Forsey  abandoned  Smallwood  over  his development policies. The Liberals successfully ran Fred Rowe, the minister of Mines and Resources, against Drover in the 1956 general election, but Rowe recalled that Drover kept the support of loggers in his district. By now, it was very clear that the Smallwood government would prefer corporate interests over those of the people if circumstances forced a choice. 14

Loggers forced the government to choose. Since the 1950s, they had belonged  to  the  Newfoundland  Lumbermen's  Association  (NLA), under Joe Thompson. The NLA had secured better pay for loggers but otherwise had become entangled in an increasingly accommodating relationship with the paper companies. By 1956, tired of his long career,  Thompson responded positively to overtures from the conservative United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners (UBJC) for a merger with the NLA. The CIO-affi  liated International Woodworkers of America (IWA) made a competing bid for the support of Newfoundland loggers. Although, like many industrial unions, the IWA had grown initially through the organizational skills and dedication of people with communist sympathies, by 1956 such infl  uences had been contained by a more moderate leftist leadership that could still sympathize with the CCF. The IWA began an enormously successful membership drive, enjoyed huge popular support among loggers and their families, and organized a strike in 1959 for higher wages and better living conditions in the woods camps.

The federal Conservative government turned down Smallwood's request to use the RCMP as strike breakers, prompting the premier

to send out to Badger (central Newfoundland) members of the Newfoundland Constabulary, a police force which normally operated only in the area near St John's. A subsequent confrontation with loggers left one constable dead, and this tragedy gave Smallwood an opportunity to deal harshly with the union. In a remarkable radio address Smallwood presented the strike as a war between two sides. On the side of the multinational corporations in the pulp and paper industry,  he  said,  were  Newfoundlanders  and  democracy  itself.  On  the side of the IWA were non-Newfoundlanders, communists, gangsters, and pimps, he claimed, despite the fact that (although initially wary) the NFL fully supported the IWA against Smallwood once it clearly had the backing of the vast majority of loggers. Smallwood, however, decertifi  ed the IWA as the bargaining agent for the loggers and appointed a Liberal Party loyalist as president of a new, more conciliatory union. 15 The forest companies later quietly granted many of the concessions which had prompted the strike, but the IWA had been dealt a fatal blow and it would take a long time for organized labour to regain its confi  dence.

The leakage from Smallwood's government benches continued. Already troubled by Smallwood's growing arrogance, Greg Power fi  nally left the government. The International Labor Organization and the Canadian Labour Congress condemned the provincial government's actions,  but  Smallwood  felt  he  had  triumphed.  Spiteful  about  the NFL's support of the IWA, Smallwood did his best to undermine that labour organization. The NFL responded by forming the Newfoundland Democratic Party, which incorporated the small CCF organization in the province. Steve Neary, the secretary-treasurer of the NFL, nonetheless decided that the federation must improve its relationship with the government and accepted publicly some minor legislative concessions by the Smallwood government. As acting president of the NFL, he declared a truce with the government, but the IWA supporters within the NFL did not accept his actions and were not surprised when Neary ran as a Liberal candidate in the next provincial election. Led by Esau Thoms, the group successfully fought Neary for control of the NFL executive, but the IWA struggle had weakened the organization considerably. 16

In a masterly stroke of political strategy, Smallwood diverted the popular anger over the IWA strike into public indignation about term 29 of the Terms of Union between Newfoundland and Canada, which had  committed  the  federal  government  to  reviewing  the  fi  nancial state  of  the  new  province  within  eight  years  of  its  entry  into  Con-

federation. As early as 1953, Smallwood had begun to build a case for more generous fi  nancial terms from Ottawa and for himself as a regional champion against federal policies favouring central Canada. Smallwood was upset with the paltry $8 million per year in perpetuity in increased subsidies recommended by the McNair Commission, which conducted the review, and Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's initial refusal to pay even that. Smallwood, the champion of Confederation, threatened in 1962 to take Newfoundland out of Canada amid an outpouring of provincial popular support for his position.

As matters stood, of course, Newfoundland received other transfer payments from the federal government according to the formula that applied to all provinces. However, even with federal money the province's  expenditures  still  outstripped  its  revenues.  The  federal government continued to be a visible presence in the modernization of Newfoundland, especially so in the creation of the province's fi  rst national  park  at  Terra  Nova  between  1957  and  1961.  The  National Parks Branch (NPB) of the Canadian Department of Northern Affairs and Natural Resources did everything it could to accommodate the Smallwood government's economic development agenda. The NPB accepted the location of the national park on the northeast coast of Newfoundland that would maximize the federal government's fi  nancial responsibility for the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway across the island (the federal government took complete fi  nancial responsibility for the highway within national park boundaries rather than the usual 50-50 per cent sharing of the costs with the provinces). More important, the federal government agreed that commercial logging would be allowed in Terra Nova National Park to feed a third pulp and paper mill on the east coast of Newfoundland, should one ever be constructed. The construction and operation of the park also provided a  limited  number  of  jobs  to  people  in  local  communities such as Port Blandford, Traytown, and Charlottetown, but the federal and provincial governments forced no one to move to accommodate the park and even recognized local people's fi  shing rights and timber harvesting rights within its boundaries. 17

The provincial government could not conduct its business simply by blaming all of its woes on the federal government. Aware that his failed economic policies, political scandals, and treatment of loggers jeopardized his support among rural Newfoundlanders, Smallwood began to give the fi  shing industry more attention. In 1962, he held a Fisheries Convention of businesspeople, fi  shers, scientists, and government offi  cials. The premier remained convinced that the develop-

ment of a modern, technologically intensive, centralized fresh/frozen fishing industry was of paramount importance to the province, but he had come to realize that many inshore fi  shing people continued to depend on the salt fi  shery. So Smallwood developed a plan for its revitalization based on the hope that the federal government would invest in it through the federal Agricultural and Rural Development Act (ARDA). Hence, in the next provincial election, Smallwood promised more public support for boat building and harbour facilities, exploration for new fi  sh resources, and the construction of community-owned fish plants and stages. In 1963, the Newfoundland government further proposed that the federal government develop a national, community-based fi  sheries development policy similar to that provided in ARDA for other rural communities.

The federal government refused to accept the proposal or to support fi  nancially Smallwood's earlier campaign promises but held to the modernization plan fi  rst outlined by Stewart Bates. It was reluctant to invest in an industry that produced such a low-value commodity and that was subject to growing international competition. During these  years,  the  Canadian  government  had  pursued  talks  with  the United States and, through the Law of the Sea Conferences of the late 1950s and early 1960s, aimed at expanding its territorial control over marine resources from three to twelve miles at sea. The United States, however, was uninterested in having its maritime rights limited, and, in the context of the mounting Cold War, Canada had little means to prevail on its much more powerful ally. The federal government saw little  option  but  to  encourage  modernization  of  the  Newfoundland fishing industry so that it might better meet its foreign competitors in designated growth areas. 18

In  1965,  the  federal  and  provincial  governments  negotiated  the Household  Resettlement  Program,  which  continued  the  province's earlier centralization program, but aimed to move people out of the fishing industry by creating 'growth poles' of resettled people as a local unskilled labour pool that might attract industry. In 1954, the provincial government had turned to resettling the widely dispersed populations of coastal  communities into centralized  locations,  thus reducing  the  cost  of  delivering  health  care,  education,  and  public utilities such as electricity. Many rural people initially favoured resettlement, especially women, who had borne the high costs of trying to arrange the education of their children and maintaining their families' well-being in the absence of well-developed educational and medical facilities. Disillusionment quickly set in, however, as resettled people

found little work, inadequate housing, poor land for supplementary farming, and insuffi  cient fi  nancial assistance from government in their new communities. 19

Resettlement nevertheless encouraged consumerism as rural people depended more than ever on cash coming into the community in the form of make-work programs, community council work, unemployment insurance, and other forms of social assistance. The provincial government remained committed to raising the standard of living for most people in the province by increasing their ability to consume, and in this it had, not surprisingly, the support of the St John's business community. Although that community later complained frequently about the public debt that accompanied the expansion of the welfare state, postwar St John's businesses concentrated on the provision of wholesale, retail, and other services to provincial consumer markets made possible by government spending. 20

The new resettlement program had its most traumatic impact in Labrador in the immediate context of the industrial exploitation of its  interior  resources.  Smallwood saw Labrador as a resource to be developed for the sake of Newfoundland; it was to be the keystone of a provincial economic empire. Anxious to establish a team of empire builders, Smallwood had gone to the United Kingdom in 1952 to offer  much  of  the  Labrador  interior  for  private  development  to  such luminaries as Sir Winston Churchill and Anthony de Rothschild. A consortium of corporations, including Bowaters, the AND, Rio Tinto Company Limited, and, eventually, the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada, took Smallwood up on his offer. Incorporated in 1953 as the British Newfoundland Corporation (Brinco), the consortium acquired lease rights to a huge tract of the Labrador interior.

Between 1952 and 1954, Smallwood had struck up a relationship with John C. Doyle much as he had earlier with Valdmanis. Doyle's Canadian Javelin acquired lease rights to develop an iron ore mine at Wabush, close to a prospective new development by the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC). Although the IOC had been developing iron ore mining at Knob Lake on the Quebec side of the border since the 1940s, it only acquired the technical capacity to develop ore in Labrador West in the 1950s and announced that it would develop a project at Carol Lake, which became known as Labrador City. The mammoth project  generated  much  business  for  Quebec  and  Newfoundland companies, and a town grew up rapidly around the mining complex. Of the hundreds of workers and their families who poured into the town, most came from Newfoundland. Some Labrador settlers found

work with the project but faced prejudice on the part of others, and there were almost no job opportunities for Innu workers, a situation aggravated by poor transportation links between Labrador West and the coast. Similar developments occurred in Wabush. The provincial government  provided  few  services  to  Labrador  City  and  Wabush, which were mostly provided by the iron-ore companies. Over time, as the companies withdrew services, the residents of Labrador West found that the provincial government did not step in readily to fi  ll the gap, causing many residents to realize that their communities had been developed primarily to generate wealth for others, in particular applying that analysis to the island of Newfoundland rather than the corporations that made money from mining ore. 21

In  the  wake  of  the  development  of  the  iron-ore  mining  industry in Labrador, the Newfoundland government emphasized the importance of Labrador's natural resources to the economic development of the province. The original discussions between Smallwood and representatives of the Canadian government about the terms of union had included the idea that the Aboriginal peoples of the new province would come under the federal jurisdiction of the Indian Act and would be entitled to reserves and direct funding. Canadian and Newfoundland offi  cials decided against this, arguing that there was too much intermarriage between the Innu, Inuit, and people of European descent, and that the Innu and Inuit would lose their voting rights under the Indian Act. The federal government still contributed fi  nancially for the provision of services, but did so by transferring funds to the province for use in all northern communities in which there were Innu and Inuit, thereby leaving Ottawa to pay for most of the province's responsibilities in Labrador. 22

Resettlement  was  a  means  by  which  the  province  attempted  to dispossess the Innu of their rights to much of the territory in which natural resources might be found. As on the island, the Newfoundland government argued that the centralization of the Innu in a small number of settlements would allow a more effi  cient delivery of better health and educational services. However, with the establishment of the Division of Labrador Affairs within the provincial Department of Welfare, the Newfoundland government committed to the resettlement of the Innu as a way to break their supposedly 'uncivilized' reliance  on  transhumant  hunting.  The  division's  policy  was  to  assimilate the Innu into a sedentary lifestyle based on wage labour in the mining, forestry, or fi  shing industries. Authorities singled out the education of children as the primary means of achieving such assimi-

lation. The practice of Innu at Sheshatshiu to go into the bush to hunt and trap  was  incompatible  with  the  southern-based  schooling  that the government wished to develop in the community; school offi  cials, teachers, and clergy did their best to make Innu parents feel guilty about taking their children into the bush when they were supposed to be in school. 23 The province demonstrated less concern about the Innu's traditional rights to natural resources than it had, for example, for the people of the northern coast of Bonavista Bay who might have been displaced by the development of Terra Nova National Park.

To encourage permanent residence in the community, in 1957 the provincial government had begun to construct houses, ostensibly to curtail tuberculosis, which health offi  cials maintained spread easily in  the  tents  used  by  Innu  families.  However,  rather  than  build  the houses directly, the government supplied the Innu with some building materials, but did not provide the facilities for running water or the same quality of building as those used by government offi  cials and teachers: a practice of substandard housing that also characterized a later government housing project in the community from 1965 to 1968.

Throughout the 1960s, the Newfoundland government continued to pursue the centralization of southern Innu in Sheshatshiu. At the same time, the growth of Happy Valley-Goose Bay as a centre of provincial administration for Labrador affected the relations between residents of North West River and Goose Bay. Although tensions between settlers and the Innu over rights to hunting and trapping territory had been long-standing, the infl  ux of outsiders without Native ancestry to work fi  rst at the Grenfell hospital and then with the military base or government offi  ces affected the local people who worked alongside them.  Newcomers  mocked  the  settlers'  Native  heritage,  and  some settlers consequently minimized the importance of that heritage, especially in trapping. Although settlers and Innu trapped differently, they had traded with each other and got along well when members of one group had occasion to visit the hunting camps or trap tilts of the other. As more settlers from North West River worked for wages, the opportunities for such interactions diminished, and relationships between the communities worsened. Nonetheless, some settlers learned to 'play the native game,' to advertise their Native heritage when it was to their advantage. 24

Conditions were worse in the new community of Davis Inlet. Since Confederation, the Newfoundland government had failed to induce the northern Mushuau Innu to settle in a central location. However, in

1967, the Newfoundland government moved the Innu to Davis Inlet on Illuikoyak Island under the Fisheries Household Resettlement Program, although living on an island made it much more diffi  cult for the Innu to engage in the caribou hunt of the mainland. But government promised to assist them in developing a viable saltwater fi  shery there, despite little evidence to suggest that local resources would be able to support such an industry. Again, as in Sheshatshiu, the Innu did not acquire the same quality housing and facilities as the people from the south who came to run the school and provide government services. Without a water and sewage system or secure potable water supply, location of the community on an island also made garbage removal diffi  cult. The Innu incorporated their community, which they called Utshimasits, in 1969, and established the Mushuau Innu Band Council under the authority of the federal minister of Indian and Northern Affairs but chose not to register under the federal Indian Act, an action which the Mushuau Innu saw as an act of submission, even though it would have provided a range of funded programs, benefi  ts, and services. The poor quality of housing and sanitation contributed to health problems, as did the constant pressure on the Innu to stand by and watch their children be assimilated through public education. 25

Although the provincial government had initially wanted to centralize  communities  to  lower  the  cost  of  providing  medical,  social, and educational services, the program, in the case of the Innu communities, was beginning to generate as many problems as it solved. Moreover, while the province continued to fund the general expansion of health care services, these were inadequate to meet the industrial demands of modernization throughout the province, particularly in mining. At St Lawrence, for example, miners had continued to fi  ght without much success for improved working conditions and health care. Miners continued to report health problems and, by the 1950s, cancers associated with elevated levels of radiation from radon gases in the mines began to appear among older workers. Other miners suffered from dust-related respiratory problems, including silicosis. A number of federal and provincial investigations recommended that the Newfoundland government take action to deal with the dust and radiation problems in the mines. In 1960, the miners refused to work, and their union president, Aloysius Turpin, wrote to Smallwood that the mines would remain at a standstill until the companies improved conditions. Subsequent wildcat strike action forced the government to  appoint  a  royal  commission  in  1967  to  investigate  the  situation. Although ventilation systems had been installed at the mines, poor

conditions  persisted.  The  Newfoundland  government  continued  to do little about the poor enforcement of existing safety regulations and the inadequate workers' compensation system for miners and their families who suffered the ravages of industrial diseases. The Smallwood government did not accept the commission's recommendations that the government establish better industrial inspections and workers'  compensation, and tended to treat the commission as window dressing to make the mining industry look more respectable. 26

Throughout the 1960s, it was increasingly apparent to many rural Newfoundlanders and Labradorians that their province was not becoming the land of milk and honey that Smallwood had promised. To be sure, the expansion of the welfare state improved the quality of life and provided jobs for some. However, many people did not fi  nd work in the new Newfoundland of resettlement and failed industrialization. Integration into Canada meant that it was easier for them to move away to fi  nd work in the industrial centres of the mainland. Many of them found the reality of adjusting to life in the industrial cities of Ontario much different from the idealization of Canada set forth  by  Smallwood  and  the  Confederates.  A  nostalgic  romanticization of home intensifi  ed, fuelled by television and popular radio stations. From Newfoundland clubs in places such as Toronto, expatriates such as Harry Hibbs sang sadly about the homes they had given up. Much of this nostalgic popular culture painted an overly rosy picture of outport life, but the resentment underlying such nostalgia was very real. A passion developed among many Newfoundlanders living  'away'  to  return  during  the  summer  to  visit  home  and  relatives, and the Smallwood government encouraged this even more to promote the tourist industry through a 'Come Home Year' in 1966. Droves of Newfoundlanders returned home, bringing their stories of the diffi  culty of adjusting to life away and perhaps looking for signs of hope for a return in the superfi  cial elements of modernization, such as the new Trans-Canada Highway or the network of provincial parks opened to foster a modern tourism industry. 27

The benefi  ts of modernization were uncertain even for those who were able to stay and fi  nd work in the new fi  shing industry. This was especially the case for women as modernization strongly reinforced social patriarchy. While there was a clear sexual division of labour in  the  salt  fi  shery,  the  commercial  importance  of  women's  labour as 'skippers of the shore crew' muted a clear division of power and authority  by  gender  in  rural  Newfoundland  before  the  intensifi  ed commitment to modernization in the 1950s. The decline of salt fi  sh

production led to the disappearance of women-led shore crews. Government training and unemployment programs for the fi  shery emphasized that only men should become full-time, professional fi  shers, while, if women worked in the fi  shing crews of their husbands, only their husbands received unemployment insurance benefi  ts. The province also issued social benefi  ts to men but not women during downturns in the fi  shery.  Women continued to dominate the processing of fi  sh, but now as wage workers in fresh/frozen processing plants. Federal fi  sheries policies assumed that such women worked merely to supplement the 'real' wage of male breadwinners. At the provincial level, Smallwood was adamant that the fi  shery of the future was to be the more technologically intensive, offshore trawler industry but that women were to have little place in it. When the new College of Fisheries, Navigation, Marine Engineering and Electronics opened in 1964, it trained only men for the new employment opportunities of the industry. The prescribed ideal was essentially one of separate spheres, of public, virile men and private, passive women, but few men rushed into the poorly paid trawler work of the 1970s, preferring to remain in the smaller-scale, inshore fi  shery. The reality was family dependence on women's low wages for arduous work, wage levels being justifi  ed by employers' and government offi  cials' belief that women worked only for pin money. 28

Disillusionment with Smallwood ran deeper than partisan politics in the province. From 1952, Harold Horwood's columns in the Evening Telegram had served as the main public vehicle for criticism of Smallwood's industrial programs and autocratic political style. Although Horwood  left  the Telegram in  1958,  Greg  Power  began  to  criticize Smallwood in the press, suggesting that the government was using public contracts to divert money to the provincial Liberal Party's coffers. By the mid-1960s, Ray Guy had joined the Telegram . Guy's satire revealed a deep, but clear-eyed, affection  for  rural  Newfoundland, anger at the havoc wreaked by resettlement and unsuccessful industrialization, and contempt for Smallwood's leadership, whom he referred to as the OLF (Only Living Father of Confederation). Although Smallwood was an enthusiastic supporter of Memorial University of Newfoundland, and always respected its need for autonomy, he was dismayed and angry to fi  nd that the university had become a centre of academic criticism of his modernization and resettlement programs.

Unease with Smallwood extended into cultural expression.  Horwood's novel Tomorrow Will Be Sunday ,  published in 1966, revealed his  disquiet  with  the  rural  communities  that  still  gave  Smallwood

their support, but also his misgivings about the impact of modernization on the province. Throughout the mid-1960s, Horwood, with Farley  Mowat,  the  Canadian  naturalist  and  writer  who  settled  in Newfoundland with his partner Claire in 1962, began to promote a countercultural revival, based on a romanticized outport idyll, against the impact of modernization on Newfoundland. The bleakest view of Newfoundland society was by the novelist Percy Janes, whose House of Hate (1970) suggested that the spiteful patriarchy of its chief character, Saul Stone, arose from the hardships of outport life as well as the demands of life in fi  ctional Milltown, loosely based on industrial Corner Brook. In Janes's novel, the milk that fl  owed from Canaan had soured indeed. 29

Although real progress in living standards had been made in the 1950s on the basis of expanded welfare-state programs, Smallwood realized the Newfoundland economy had not developed the capacity to sustain modernization. He therefore turned to a succession of even larger-scale industrialization projects ('megaprojects') to generate employment and economic growth. In 1958, the Newfoundland government had already decided to support the expansion of a provincial power grid to further rural electrifi  cation. In 1963, the Newfoundland Power Commission took advantage of federal funds to develop the Bay d'Espoir hydro project, completed in 1970. The project guaranteed cheap, reliable power for megaprojects. From 1966 through 1968, the  Smallwood  government  had  successfully  courted  Albright  and Wilson Ltd to build a phosphorous manufacturing facility at Long Harbour, Placentia Bay, through its Canadian subsidiary, the Electric Reduction Company of Canada Industries Ltd (ERCO). The large facility generated a lot of permanent jobs, but shortly after it went into operation in late 1968, it caused serious environmental problems when its effl  uent killed large numbers of fi  sh in the bay. Smallwood also returned to the old dream of a third paper mill, originally believing that Come By Chance in Placentia Bay would be an ideal site. American industrialist  John  Shaheen had fi  rst  suggested the mill for the area because it was close to a cheap source of hydroelectricity and had an ice-free port and plenty of fresh water required for paper production. However, the government found that all the timber was controlled by the owners of the Corner Brook and Grand Falls mills.

Shaheen, who had already developed the Golden Eagle Oil refi  nery at Holyrood, then convinced the premier that he could build an oil refi  nery at Come By Chance. The provincial government provided much of the fi  nancing directly through bonds or indirectly through

loan  guarantees,  helped  negotiate  federal  assistance  for  docks  and wharves, and designated the refi  nery as a crown corporation so that it would be exempt from federal taxes. Shaheen invested little in the project. Smallwood also ensured the fi  nancial backing that would allow John C. Doyle to form Labrador Linerboard Ltd, which built a third forestry mill, the kraft linerboard mill at Stephenville. Plagued by  scandal  in  the  past,  Doyle  eventually  faced  legal  charges  alleging that he was defrauding the project and took refuge in Panama. These megaprojects gave ammunition to the critics who pointed out resources were being given away and the province driven into debt to fund developments that created few jobs. 30

Smallwood sowed the seeds of his own demise with his efforts to modernize  Newfoundland.  His  autocratic  style  of  leadership  had made him many enemies who were waiting for an opportunity to unseat him. He rejuvenated the Liberal Party during the late 1960s with a new generation of talented people, including John Crosbie, Edward Roberts, and Clyde Wells. Crosbie and Wells soon chafed under Smallwood's domination and left cabinet in 1968 when Smallwood proposed that the government should advance $5 million to Shaheen to help the industrialist prospect for capital to build Come By Chance. When the premier announced his retirement, Crosbie became a candidate for the leadership of the party. Smallwood could not stand the thought of anyone else being premier, especially Crosbie, whom he disliked, and in a bitter leadership convention successfully retained the leadership of the party. Smallwood remained the premier, but the Progressive Conservative Party was the real winner as many of those who wanted greater measures of democracy, including Crosbie, defected to it or, like Wells, retired from politics. 31

Through the 1950s and into the 1960s, the Smallwood government hoped to develop the signifi  cant hydroelectric power potential of the Grand Falls on the Hamilton River, newly renamed Churchill Falls in 1965 as part of the land and water rights acquired by Brinco. Unfortunately there was no demand for the power within Labrador and Quebec refused to allow transmission lines to be built across its province to deliver the power to the American market. Political considerations dictated that the federal government would never intervene to force Quebec to allow the lines, so only by selling the power to the provincially owned Hydro Quebec could the power reach markets. Hydro Quebec consequently drove a hard bargain with Brinco in 1969 in a contract that permitted construction to begin. The project fl  ooded thousands of square kilometres of Innu land without their being con-

sulted, let alone compensated. The Innu lost forever important cultural sites at places such as Kanekuanegau and Meshikamau, which disappeared under the Smallwood Reservoir. The Innu and trappers from settler  communities such as North West River lost trap lines, equipment, and hunting territory through the fl  ooding of a region that was more than one-half the size of Lake Ontario. By the early 1970s, when electricity prices rose dramatically, the public learned that the ninety-nine-year contract contained no provision to raise the price, so Hydro Quebec reaped a huge annual windfall and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador nothing. 32  Over subsequent decades 'Churchill Falls' became symbolic of Newfoundland's weak position within Confederation and Newfoundland politicians' propensity to sign bad deals with capitalist interests from outside the province.

Perhaps more alarming for Smallwood in the short term were signs that his popular support was crumbling. One of the most disturbing signs was the fi  rst strike by the province's teachers in 1971. A professional association of teachers, the Newfoundland Teachers' Association  (NTA),  had  existed  since  1890.  Although  it  did  not  bargain collectively, the NTA always sought better salaries, pensions, and insurance for its members, as well as professional development. Suffering drastic salary cuts under the Commission of Government, the NTA fared better during Smallwood's early years. The association made notable achievements through the 1950s, including mandatory membership for all teachers and pay equity between men and women in the profession. Through the 1960s, the NTA fostered a commitment to full post-secondary degrees among its members, and teachers became crucial agents of Smallwood's social modernization. Nonetheless, the Smallwood government was put off by the growing importance of the NTA and the social and political infl  uence of teachers, and dragged its heels in bargaining with them over wages. In the spring of 1971, teachers began rotating strikes, but the government forced the NTA to  desist.  Smallwood  underestimated  the  degree  to  which  teachers enjoyed popular support and attributed his defeat in the ensuing fall election partially to them. 33

The groundswell of social reaction against the Smallwood regime that had been building since the 1960s broke over the government at Burgeo. In rural Newfoundland, fi  shers were rallying around Richard Cashin and Father Desmond McGrath. Cashin and McGrath had founded the Northern Fishermen's Union in 1970, which within fi  ve months broadened as the Newfoundland Fishermen, Food and Allied Workers' Union (NFFAWU). An intense strike at Canso, Nova Scotia,

in 1970-1 led to legal recognition of fi  shers' rights to unionize, at least in the offshore fi  shing fl  eet. Unionization began fi  rst in the processing plants of the Newfoundland industry. In the summer of 1971, militant workers in Spencer Lake's Burgeo Fish Industries plant went on strike for better wages following a tough certifi  cation fi  ght. Lake used court injunctions and strike breakers, and the strikers retaliated with store-breaking. Lake left town, and the government had to expropriate the plant. Across the province, the NFFAWU successfully struck for union recognition and better wages to help plant workers realize the promise of a better material life held out by modernization proponents. The Newfoundland government decided in 1971 to allow offshore and inshore fi  shers to join the NFFAWU. Petty producers in the inshore fi  shery and wage workers in the offshore sector joined the NFFAWU as the union spread out from the plants. Further strikes, by inshore fi  shers at Port au Choix in 1974, and strikes against the owners of much of the province's trawler fl  eet in 1974-5, confi  rmed that the union was a major social and political counterpoint to the fading infl  uence of the premier in rural Newfoundland and Labrador. 34

Another  rejection  of  Smallwood's  modernization  plans  for  rural Newfoundland came in the form of the Fogo Island Co-op. The co-op's roots lay in a decision by the island's main fi  sh buyer, Newfoundland-Labrador Export Company, to shut down in 1963. A local improvement committee, which had been focusing on road development, approached Memorial University's Extension Services, which sponsored a conference in Fogo in 1967. The conference raised the possibility of a cooperative amid an initiative by the National Film Board (NFB). Through what became known as the 'Fogo process,' the NFB cooperated with local people in producing fi  lms for local communities, which allowed residents to articulate their desires for the future and to refl  ect on collective measures that might realize them. In December, the communities of Fogo Island rejected the possibility of resettlement by forming the Fogo Island Shipbuilding and Producers Co-operative Society. The co-op established a shipyard and acquired fish plants to process and store fi  sh caught by members; its goal was to  use  local  labour  and  capital  in  small-scale  enterprises  to  sustain Fogo Island's communities. Although it obtained some government assistance to build its shipyard, the co-op found that the Smallwood government was not interested in helping it build a frozen-fi  sh plant. The  government  preferred  investment  in  much  larger,  centralized plants  in  accordance  with  its  modernization  agenda.  Although  the government was willing to let people experiment with cooperatives,

and at one time Smallwood felt that they were a good alternative to more radical socialist options for rural development, it preferred to regulate  rather  than  promote  the  community-based  organizations. Nonetheless, the co-op persevered, becoming the largest employer on Fogo Island. 35

Working-class discontent continued to build in mining communities through 1971. In St Lawrence, miners' continued frustration with poor  employer  and  government  commitments  to  safety  conditions served as the backdrop for the St Lawrence Workers Protective Union's (SLWPU's) demand for a wage increase of $1.25 per hour. Before the fl  uorspar miners could go on strike against their recalcitrant employer, thirty women from St Lawrence and the nearby community of Lawn picketed a loading dock to prevent an ore carrier from departing.  Although  they  supported  the  miners'  demand  for  more money, a deeper frustration with the industrial carnage wreaked by dust, radiation, and accidents on the men who went into the mines underlay the protesting women's concerns. In September, the St Lawrence Company agreed to pay $0.40 more per hour in wages, with a further $0.19 per hour to be paid in a year, and made concessions on seniority, sick benefi  ts, and vacation time. The provincial government further agreed to set up a special fund to aid disabled miners and their dependents. In central Newfoundland, miners at Buchans, members of local 5457 of the United Steelworkers of America, went on strike against American Smelting and Refi  ning Company (ASARCO). The miners won higher wages but were back on the picket line in 1973. Perhaps sensing that the end of mining was near, as available mineral reserves were forecast to be depleted by 1979, the miners tried to get as much as possible from a company that was enjoying excellent profi  ts. ASARCO owned the town site and cut services to the miners' families. Violence broke out on the picket lines as non-union employees tried to cross, but miners' wives and children reinforced the lines. After months of disruption, the company gave in and gave the miners $0.87 more per hour. 36

While Buchans's mining days were numbered, other union activities  suggested  that  workers  were  becoming  dissatisfi  ed  with  their lot in the new Newfoundland. Throughout the province, strikes and industrial  unrest  marked  trades  and  the  civil  service.  Public  sector workers were especially important because of the massive growth in the  federal,  provincial,  and  municipal  governments  brought  about by Confederation. The Smallwood government had bullied hospital workers in Corner Brook in 1963 who had joined the National Un-

ion of Public Employees (NUPE) and struck for better wages. NUPE joined with another national union of public employees to form the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) in 1963, and it began to organize throughout Newfoundland. Smallwood threatened to ban public sector strikes, and in 1967 Clyde Wells, then minister of Labour, introduced legislation to outlaw strikes at hospitals when workers at the Central Newfoundland Hospital in Grand Falls went on strike. CUPE  kept  organizing.  Although  the  Newfoundland  Government Employees' Association (NGEA) began as a professional association in the 1930s, by 1968 it represented provincial employees as a union. The NGEA led mass protests against the Smallwood government in 1970 when the provincial budget provided no wage increases. The government agreed to collective bargaining two months later by passing the Public Service (Collective Bargaining) Act. In 1971, the NGEA became the Newfoundland Association of Public Employees (NAPE), one of the largest and most powerful unions in the province. 37

Disappointing megaprojects, the failure to industrialize the growth centres, antagonistic relationships with workers, and Smallwood's autocratic leadership style all combined to undermine his dominance of the political system. In Labrador, growing resentment about the lack of local benefi  ts arising from the development of its resources, compared with the benefi  ts realized by the island portion of the province, fuelled support for independent MHA Tom Burgess's New Labrador party, founded in 1970. By 1970 many young Liberals had defected to  the  Progressive  Conservative  Party,  which  under  the  leadership of young businessman Frank Moores seemed to offer a more professional  alternative.  The  1971  provincial  election  was  a  hard-fought contest between Smallwood and those who wanted to remove him from power. The result was uncertain and contested; 21 Conservatives  were elected versus 20 Liberals and one representative of the New Labrador party. Yet Smallwood refused to resign the premiership while judicial recounts and the prospect of members changing party allegiance held out the hope that he could hold on to power. The election of 1972 returned a majority for the Progressive Conservatives. Although he attempted a return to political life in 1975, Smallwood's personal hegemony had ended. 38

By 1972, Newfoundland and Labrador had changed. Throughout the province, most residents, with the notable exception of aboriginal people, took for granted the conveniences of the modern age. Social and educational services were available at unprecedented levels. Improvements in living standards had come at a price. Smallwood had

dealt  dictatorially  with  the  organized  labour  movement.  Outports had been disturbed by resettlement in the interest of economic modernization, but little had come from this. Overcapacity dominated the fisheries, and growth centres had failed to attract signifi  cant new industries. There were new industrial ventures in hydroelectricity and oil processing, but at great cost to government. The government had treated Labrador as a convenience for the island, but Churchill Falls had only provoked popular ire. The province had become dependent on federal fi  nancial assistance and management of its key marine resources. Dissatisfaction was building as people became interested in new notions of nation.

## The Limits of Neo-nationalism, 1972-2003

Disarray within the Liberal Party helped the Progressive Conservatives come to power under Frank Moores in 1972. Many Newfoundlanders and Labradorians were unhappy with how the Smallwood era's economic diversifi  cation policies had disrupted their lives. The Progressive Conservative governments of Moores and his successor, Brian  Peckford,  seeking  distance  from  Smallwood  and  modernization, promised (but failed to deliver) a more supportive approach to rural economic development, continuing to rely heavily on industrial staples, whether old ones in fi  sh, forests, and mines, or the potentially lucrative new development of offshore oil. The Peckford government, inspired by the neo-nationalism of a new generation of well-educated and  relatively  affl  uent  professionals,  fought  for  greater  provincial control over natural resources and greater constitutional autonomy for provinces. Its rural development policy boiled down to dependence  on  make-work  programs  to  manoeuvre  seasonally  employed and underemployed residents onto federally administered programs, especially Unemployment Insurance, and its successor, Employment Insurance. Worse, at least in the case of overcapacity in the fi  shing industry, the Newfoundland and Labrador government had to shoulder responsibility along with federal authorities. The Liberal government of Clyde Wells accepted the importance of the federal presence in Newfoundland and Labrador but continued to shift the burden of retrenchment onto working people, a process begun by the Peckford government during the recession of the 1980s. Major natural-resource developments under the Liberal regime of the 1990s and early 2000s

resurrected national commitments but, as in the case of the aboriginal peoples of Labrador, in new ways that challenged the limits of older neo-nationalism.

Everywhere, signs of trouble appeared in Smallwood's 'new' Newfoundland  and  Labrador.  Rural  communities  languished  even  as urban development accelerated, fuelled by the expansion of government at the provincial and federal levels in St John's. The expansion of educational opportunities for rural people throughout the province, however, meant that many young people coming to St John's to take up positions in government were only too familiar with the persistent problems of their home communities. They feared the long-term implications of their province being without the economic capacity to support the consumer expectations of its population and resented the manner in which Newfoundland continued to be a source of raw materials and labour for economic development in other parts of Canada and beyond. 1

The fi  rst generation of well-educated, relatively affl  uent Newfoundlanders to come of age under Smallwood reacted against his regime in a variety of ways. In general, there was widespread aversion to the government's modernization policies and a rejection of Smallwood's personal,  dictatorial  style  of  patronage  politics.  Memorial  University  of  Newfoundland became the centre of a new interest in rural Newfoundland and Labrador's cultural, social, and other strengths. In  1968,  a  highly  respected  folklorist,  Herbert  Halpert,  became  the first head of the new department of folklore and started to gather the oral history and culture of the outports. In addition to the Division of Extension Services, Memorial's Institute of Social and Economic Research generated a range of social, historical, and geographical studies of  rural  Newfoundland and Labrador and provided support to regional development associations, which had begun fi  rst on the Great Northern Peninsula, then on the Eastport Peninsula and Fogo Island. Through Extension  Services  and  the  Centre  for  Community  Initiatives, the university provided training and other forms of support to the rural development movement. By the early 1970s, the advocates of small-scale, rural economic development, reinforced by the research findings that had accumulated a great deal of new knowledge about the province, found support in the form of the Moores's Progressive Conservatives' attacks on the Smallwood government. 2

The  diversity  of  the  new  political  and  cultural  consciousness  in Newfoundland and Labrador also became apparent in the arts community. Throughout the 1970s, poets such as Al Pittman and Tom

Dawe, writers such as Cassie Brown, and visual artists such as David Blackwood produced works that extolled the virtues of mythic, communal outports in reaction to the modernization of Smallwood. A key contribution  of  Memorial  University  was  its  theatrical  community, especially Michael Cook's Open Group, but also Dudley Cox's Newfoundland Traveling Theatre Company and, appearing in 1972, Chris Brookes's  Mummers  Troupe.  Brookes  moved  the  reaction  against Smallwood to the left, drawing on the old tradition of mummering as  a  form  of  mischievous,  class-based  protest  against  elitism  and privilege.  Committed  to  a  consensus-based,  democratic,  and  open organization, Brookes nonetheless brought an ideological dedication to using theatre in the pursuit of social justice. He used the apparent farce of clowns, puppets, and masks to expose the underlying social, economic, and political roots of exploitation that dominated the dayto-day lives of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. The Mummers Troupe  developed  its  message  for  rural  and  working-class  people throughout the province, identifying the forces of capitalism that undermined the basis of their families  and  communities.  The  Troupe hoped  that  its  socialist  theatre  would  offer  Newfoundlanders  and Labradorians  an  alternative  to  the  'cloned  plastic-wrapped  homogeneity  of  North  American  consumer capitalism.'  Although  it  produced plays about the class inequalities underlying the IWA strike, the Buchans strike, and recent developments in the fi  shing industry, the Mummers Troupe hoped to mobilize popular indignation along nationalist lines. Brookes later remembered the Troupe as 'wrapping ourselves in the rhetoric of righteous regionalism.' Eventually, 'doctrinaire xenophobia' split the group, leaving it with a 'legacy of simplistic political analysis.' 3

There was a less political undercurrent running through CODCO, founded in 1973. Its fi  rst members - Tommy Sexton, Greg Malone, Cathy Jones, Mary Walsh, Andy Jones, D. Olsen, and Bob Joy - took it  upon  themselves  to  be  the  critics  of  'hypocrisy  and  pretension everywhere.'  Although  sometimes  partaking  of  the  neo-nationalist sentiments growing in Newfoundland at the time, the members of CODCO held nothing dear,  including  the  rural  and  working-class sympathies of their counterparts in the Mummers Troupe. CODCO members identifi  ed with the marginalized, especially as Newfoundlanders in Canada, but seemed almost consumed by their anger and resigned to what Mary Walsh later referred to as 'the intrinsic unfairness of life.' Part of the group's political cynicism arose from the roots of its success in what Brookes called 'Newfcult.' He recalled that

CODCO's 'comedic caricatures of rustic Newfoundlanders were the talk of the town' in cities such as Toronto and Ottawa but 'were practically booed off the stage when they toured rural Newfoundland.' In St John's, however, CODCO's emphasis on the supposedly separate and much put-upon identity of Newfoundlanders within Canada played well to cultural conservatives who liked the neo-nationalist implications of their work but did not have to feel threatened by the leftism embedded in the Mummers Troupe's work. 4

Frank Moores had talked tough on the campaign trail about the need to end the Smallwood government's close relationship with industrial promoters such as John Shaheen or John C. Doyle. The Progressive Conservatives had promised a new approach to provincial development, based on rejuvenating fi  sheries,  forestry,  agriculture, and other rural activities. Nonetheless, the new government continued the focus on heavy industrialization that characterized the late Smallwood era. Much of the government's effort went into trying to renegotiate the sale of hydro power from the Churchill Falls development to Quebec. The effort failed, even though the Moores government spent $160 million to buy the company from Brinco. In 1975, the Moores government propped up the Come by Chance oil refi  nery with $60 million, only to see it shut down the next year. Its further investment of $25 million in the Stephenville linerboard mill in 1976 failed to prevent the mill's closure in 1977. Finally, Alcan closed its mining operations on the Burin Peninsula in 1978. While most of these failures  were the legacies of the Smallwood years, Premier Moores was not above accepting fl  ights on a jet owned by Doyle, and did not object when a new ship, the Frank D. Moores , joined the Joseph R. Smallwood in Shaheen's oil tanker fl  eet. 5

The Moores government brought little new to fi  sheries policy. It continued to allow overcapacity to develop in fi  sh processing as other rural industries lagged, lending weight to the accusation that the fi  shery was nothing more than an 'employer of last resort.' Although the provincial Progressive Conservatives brought neo-nationalist rhetoric to their views about the relationship between St John's and Ottawa in fi  sheries management, it left most of the major work to the federal government. Throughout the early 1970s, many people felt that the local fi  shing industry could expand despite declining domestic fi  sh landings if only foreign fi  shing effort could be limited. Such effort by large factory freezer trawlers had expanded on the offshore banks. Part  of  a  larger  Atlantic  Canadian  trend,  Newfoundland  fi  sh  companies began to invest in a larger offshore fl  eet and, with provincial

encouragement, built more processing plants in coastal communities throughout the island and Labrador. Although the Moores government encouraged the development of fi  sh plants, the province, like its predecessor, continued to be unsupportive of co-ops, such as that on Fogo Island. 6

The politics of the seal hunt reinforced the notion among many people in the province that foreigners were doing their best to hold back the development of a thriving Newfoundland. Matters came to a head in 1977 when anti-sealing protesters, including French actress Brigitte Bardot, converged on St Anthony. There had been episodic protests about the allegedly inhumane nature of the seal hunt since the late 1940s. In 1964, the federal government had enacted regulations to ensure the humane conduct of the hunt. The measures, and subsequent efforts, including quotas and later openings of the hunt, failed to mollify a growing international animal rights movement, which called for an abolition of the hunt by the early 1970s.

Led by the International Fund for Animal Welfare and, in 1976, by the Greenpeace Foundation, the anti-hunt protest focused on bringing celebrities and observers to the hunt to protest, record, and eventually campaign for funding internationally. Throughout rural Newfoundland and Labrador, many people still made their livings by slaughtering animals, either in fi  shing or farming, and many continued to hunt for sport and food. Far removed from the necessity and pleasures of the hunt, but still often benefi  ting from the products of butchering and processing domestic animals, the bourgeois militants of North America and Western Europe attacked the seal hunt to defend the 'wild' and to allay their fears about their own complicity in the excesses of contemporary global capitalism. Although Greenpeace initially supported the smaller-scale 'landsmen' hunt conducted by inshore fishers in vessels less than 65 feet long, protesting only against the large-scale factory ships that were going deep into the ice by the late 1970s, it declared against the entire hunt in 1976. Composed largely of affl  uent, urban North American professionals, groups such as Greenpeace had no sympathy for the struggle of ordinary working people to make a living in rural Newfoundland and Labrador. Local people perceived the protest as a condescending critique of an economic activity that had much deeper social and cultural signifi  cance in rural parts of the province. Many felt that the international protest movement cynically and selfi  shly manipulated the court of international opinion to raise funds with which they supported themselves. Increasingly angry confrontations between sealers and protesters re-

sulted in federal efforts to control the presence of the latter at the ice. In St John's, the seal hunt became a neo-nationalist cause when, in 1979, local businessman Miller Ayre, with John McGrath, announced the formation of the Codpeace Foundation. A parody of Greenpeace, Codpeace engaged in a number of publicity stunts about the manner in which seals victimized cod, using satire and sarcasm to puncture the  infl  ated  self-importance  of  the  anti-hunt  protesters  and  to  help manufacture a more positive sense of Newfoundland identity. 7

The development of Gros Morne National Park on the west coast of Newfoundland illustrated the persistence of rural decline and resettlement for many small coastal communities despite the efforts of the Progressive Conservative government. By 1970, the Smallwood government had become far more interested in the economic potential of tourism in the establishment of national parks and agreed with the federal government in 1973 to establish Gros Morne. The provincial government planned to resettle the 175 families of twelve communities to larger towns in the area to make way for the park. It offered financial assistance to these families but chose to induce their relocation by restricting their right to develop their property and by limiting their right to sell it only to the province. A local trend of resettlement to nearby communities such as Rocky Harbour, Cow Head, Woody Point, and Norris Point to gain access to better services was already under way, encouraged by resettlement programs, but people persisted in the fi  shing and logging outports of Lobster Cove, Green Point, Belldown's Point, and Baker's Brook, the last holding out until 1981, when the lack of services and government restrictions on their rights to sell their land forced residents to move. Although thirty families from Sally's Cove moved to Rocky Harbour and Woody Point, the protests of the remaining twenty against relocation, partially galvanized by the Mummers Troupe's 1973 play Gros Mourn ,  forced  the province and the federal government to develop the national park around their community. The actions of the people of Sally's Cove led the National Parks Board to adopt a new policy on the development of new parks in 1979 based on a commitment to earning more local public support and using no expropriation of local people's property. Gros Morne was a boon to the growth centres such as Rocky Harbour and Cow Head. These communities continued to serve as homes to people working in forestry and the fi  shery, who were able to maintain fishing rights within the park. However, the towns also developed hotels, restaurants, and related services to cater to the needs of the many tourists who came to admire the natural beauty and geological

signifi  cance  of  the  park  (recognized  as  a  UNESCO  World Heritage Site in 1988) while eating their lunches on the picnic sites established on the remains of resettled outports within the park. 8

Throughout the Moores years, there was much popular sympathy for the provincial government, which grew from frustration with the inability of federal regional development programs to stimulate signifi  cant economic development. When Moores resigned as premier in 1979, his successor, A. Brian Peckford, initially seemed to best articulate the frustration and ambition of a younger generation of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, who felt disappointed by their experience as the newest Canadians. In particular, although there was much local optimism about the possibility of offshore oil development, the federal government held jurisdiction over the exploration process and had allowed a free-entry system through the 1970s. By the late 1970s, only about 10 per cent of Newfoundland and Labrador's continental shelf remained available for exploration. Younger members of the provincial  Progressive Conservatives took up the cry against mismanagement by the federal government of Pierre Trudeau. One of Peckford's colleagues, Leo Barry, minister of the Department of Mines and Energy, led the way in the province's development of its own exploration regulations, but Barry lost his seat in the 1975 general election, opening the way for Peckford to become minister in 1976. Peckford fought vigorously to ensure that Newfoundland and Labrador benefi  ted as much as possible from offshore oil development. He maintained that only the province had the moral authority and regulatory capacity to develop the industry in the best interests of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. Peckford's anti-Ottawa stance overshadowed the provincial Liberals, stained as they were by their continued association with the federal Liberal government. The provincial New Democratic Party had been enjoying some success under the leadership of John Greene, but its political asceticism, especially its refusal to embrace the political theatre of demonstrations, rallies, and political bombast, meant that it was no match for the fi  ery oratory of Peckford, who enjoyed the political capital of his image as the 'scrappy fi  ghter from the outports, pitted against the too-smooth Pierre Trudeau.' 9

The new premier was the archetype of the 'new Newfoundlander,' made by, but rebelling against, the government policies of the Smallwood  years.  In  his  later  manifesto,  Peckford  recalled  his  youth  in Whitbourne, his unhappy time in Toronto as a young boy in 1959, and his intellectual coming of age as a student at Memorial University in the 1960s. On a personal level, he resented the manner in which the 'St

John's crowd' made 'baymen' such as Peckford feel unwelcome. More important, he disagreed with the underlying principle of the Smallwood-era development programs, 'getting away from the fi  shery.' To Peckford, it was bad enough that Smallwood had no interest in rural revitalization; even worse were the 'dictatorial styles and obvious ineptitude' of the Smallwood government and its 'lack of any sound management of our resources, the iron ore deal, the Upper Churchill deal, the Long Harbour phosphorous plant deal[;] all stood in testament of the failure of the 'develop or perish' syndrome.'

The problem was more than just Smallwood according to Peckford; Newfoundlanders and Labradorians had not joined Canada in Confederation so much as they had surrendered to it. This surrender was a symptom of a national inferiority complex buried 'deep in our psyche' and fl  owing 'from our whole history of colonialism, subjugation and exploitation. Newfoundland was frequently a resource base to be exploited for the benefi  t of the mother country.' 10 Peckford's desire to revitalize Newfoundland and Labrador struck a positive chord with a nativist element running through Newfoundland's growing middle class. Anxious about the limited success of modernization, and desiring a provincial cultural identity that might simultaneously contain social discontent within and present a united front to forces without, many residents of the province embraced romantic, popular forms that mythologized the best qualities of outport life. 11

Peckford  immediately  set  about  saving  Newfoundlanders  from their colonial  subjugation.  His  government  commissioned  artist Christopher Pratt to design a new provincial fl  ag to replace the old Union Jack, which the legislature adopted in 1980. Soon after his election in 1979, Peckford demanded that the federal government make provincial needs the central objective in managing the northern cod stocks fi  sheries. Reviewing the historical importance of these stocks to Newfoundland, and pointing out that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians  were  responsible  for  about  98  per  cent  of  the  Canadian fishing effort directed toward them, Peckford demanded that they be reserved for the province's inshore and middle-distance fl  eets. Larger,  offshore  vessels  should only be allowed a share of federally set total allowable catches when it was clear that there was a surplus that could not be taken by the smaller-scale Newfoundland fi  sheries. Even then,  the  offshore  vessels  must  not  be  allowed  to  land  the  fi  sh  for processing anywhere but in Newfoundland and Labrador. Peckford adamantly opposed the federal government's practices of allowing non-Newfoundland freezer trawlers to fi  sh  for  northern  cod  either

directly or as a by-catch of fi  sheries for species such as shrimp. He decried the federal government's ignorance of his views, arguing that its 'approach to Northern Cod is analogous to the Province of British Columbia having no say in forestry or the Province of Alberta having no say in energy.' Further arguing that 'the management of the Province's fi  shing resource by the Government of the Province represents a historic and moral right of Newfoundlanders to the economic benefi  ts of those resources in the surrounding sea,' Peckford demanded a short-term federal-provincial mechanism for fi  sheries policy, while giving notice that the province would seek constitutional change to entrench its jurisdiction over northern cod. The Peckford government additionally approached the Quebec government to renegotiate the Upper Churchill Falls hydro contract to allow a greater share of the economic surplus for Newfoundland and Labrador. At the same time, the Newfoundland government also asked mining and forestry companies for better royalty agreements, increased employment, and improved conservation practices. 12

Offshore oil became the watchword of Peckford's own version of the  'new'  Newfoundland. Years of exploration had fi  nally resulted in a major oil fi  nd in 1979 by Chevron Standard Limited at the Hibernia oil well, located 350 kilometres east of St John's on the Grand Banks. Peckford had hoped that the election of a minority Progressive Conservative government in Ottawa in the same year would result in federal recognition of the right of Newfoundland and Labrador to jurisdiction and greater control over offshore resources. The defeat of the Conservatives by the Liberals under Trudeau dashed such hopes. The Trudeau government wished to maintain federal control over offshore oil development in order to promote a number of objectives: a  secure  Canadian supply of oil in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s, revenue for the federal government, and employment and economic opportunities for all Canadians without necessary consideration of regional preferences. The Newfoundland government and Ottawa locked horns on the question of jurisdiction over offshore oil, leading Peckford to win a provincial general election in 1982 by campaigning against Ottawa's position. 13

Although Newfoundland and Ottawa were antagonists in the battle  over  which  order  of  government  would  have  jurisdiction  over offshore oil development, both rushed to foster exploration and exploitation in the context of the energy crisis and the federal National Energy Program of the 1970s. The desire on the part of the federal and provincial governments for rapid development benefi  ted the major

multinational corporations such as Mobil Oil that were involved in the search for oil off the east coast. The Newfoundland government's interest focused almost entirely on which jurisdiction would control the economic benefi  ts of development, and, like the federal government, it paid little attention to the regulation of offshore workers' safety. The offshore oil industry, sadly, took on a more tragic signifi  cance for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1982. On Valentine's Day, a winter storm damaged and led to the sinking of the Ocean Ranger. All hands aboard the oil drilling rig lost their lives; fi  fty-six of the eightyfour crew members were Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. The tragedy was part of a rapid increase in major mishaps involving oil rigs in the offshore oil sector globally as exploratory drilling boomed throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Subsequent investigations, including a royal commission, concluded that the Ocean Ranger had been generally well built, although it was designed for, and tested in, the waters of the Gulf of Mexico - a very different marine environment than the Grand Banks. Tellingly, a critical ballast control room had been located too close to the water in a support column, including a porthole with glass insuffi  ciently thick to withstand severe pounding; the rig also had a ballast control system that was diffi  cult to use in emergency conditions. Worst of all, the workers who operated the Ocean Ranger did not fully understand how to operate the ballast controls during an emergency such as the storm that developed that February night. Having to abandon the rig, workers were without survival suits and found its lifeboats almost impossible to launch in the prevailing sea conditions. Although the royal commission that investigated the tragedy was unwilling to say that the Newfoundland government's local hiring preference had led the rig's operators to hire untrained workers, it suggested that hiring 'guidelines requiring a very rapid phase in of local residents can affect the overall level of safety of the drilling operations' and recommended more careful hiring and training to ensure safety. Other studies found that the offshore oil industry had paid insuffi  cient attention to workers' safety and had dealt inadequately with their complaints. 14

The Peckford government's constitutional jockeying with Ottawa did not give the province any more ability to deal with the day-today  problems  of  growing  unemployment  and  social  dislocation  in rural  areas.  The  provincial  government  continued  to  license  more fish plants as had the Smallwood and Moores governments. Issuing licences encouraged the proponents of new fi  sh plants to apply for federal fi  nancial assistance under the Regional Development Incen-

tives Act (RDIA), administered by the federal Department of Regional Economic Expansion. In effect, the province could take the credit for a new source of employment at almost no cost to itself and without taking any responsibility for the impact of the plants on fi  sheries management, which remained a federal responsibility. The plants generated only seasonal employment, but federal unemployment insurance benefi  ts made up the difference, again at no cost to the province. Provincial policy seemed clever at the time, a way in which the provincial David could force the federal Goliath to yield more, and no thought was given to the ecological impact of such a policy. To the contrary, throughout the early 1980s the Peckford government cooperated with Ottawa in a number of subsidy and loan programs to encourage fishers to build larger inshore vessels and 'midshore,' or 'nearshore,' draggers to expand the search for cod, crab, capelin, shrimp, and any other species to supply the plants. The provincial government accepted the expansion of corporate offshore trawlers so long as they were based in and controlled by Newfoundland interests.

The province had no greater vision for the fi  shery than did federal authorities and was loath to intervene in the manner in which private companies organized the industry. Overcapacity had burgeoned since 1977, when Canada extended its jurisdiction over Atlantic waters from 12 miles to 200 miles. The federal government originally planned for fisheries expansion simultaneously with restrictions on the number of people who fi  shed within the 200-mile limit to bolster incomes in that industry, but this did not happen. The insatiable demand of the processing sector for cheap raw material meant that the industry depended partly on the development of the small-scale inshore sector, and so the older small-boat inshore fi  shery also grew. Inshore fi  shing households subsidized their own costs of production by supplementing work in the fi  shery with other employment, especially the often unpaid work of women. They furthermore could accommodate low prices for fi  sh by supplementing their incomes through a variety of strategies: cutting their own wood for fuel, repairing their own boats and fi  shing equipment, and exchanging a variety of services for each other such as childcare and home maintenance. Some rural people supplemented  their  household  incomes  by  seasonal  out-migration, but a substantial portion of rural people's cash incomes came from make-work programs, community council work, unemployment insurance, welfare, and other forms of social assistance. The net effect of the 200-mile limit was that Canadian fi  shing effort, and much of

that Newfoundland and Labrador's, displaced foreign effort within the limit, and overcapacity in the industry grew unchecked. 15

Fishing policies and outport livelihood practices together ensured a cheap source of fi  sh with which to offset the higher capital costs of the offshore fl  eet amid the problems of offshore fi  shing, the periodic unavailability of fi  sh, and, more important, the volatile nature of fi  sh prices in international markets. The NFFAWU responded to the growing overcapacity of the fi  sheries by arguing that employment should be restricted to a full-time, permanent wage-labour force by excluding 'part-time' fi  shers, seeing the 'professionalization' of the fi  shery as the only way to guarantee its members good living standards. As overproduction and market gluts in 1977 and 1978 lowered the prices fishers received for their catches, the union had negotiated direct sales of unprocessed fi  sh for better prices to Eastern European buyers. The Moores and Peckford governments, however, were incensed that the federal government permitted the sales and condemned them using a  rhetoric  that  was  at  once  anti-union  and  neo-nationalist,  arguing that a cabal of federal offi  cials and union leaders was giving away processing jobs to foreigners. While the provincial governments made much of their desire to protect 'our Newfoundland way of life,' they did more to protect the low prices offered by Newfoundland processors, fended off competition from Maritimes and foreign buyers, and depressed the incomes of Newfoundland and Labrador fi  shers. 16

By the mid-1980s, the Newfoundland fi  shing industry was in crisis, largely because of the problem of overcapacity. The 1982 federal Kirby Task Force on the Atlantic Fisheries had recommended reducing capacity and increasing the effi  ciency of the industry by merging companies  and  introducing  new  processing  technologies.  By  1984, years of overcapacity, competition, and market gluts had driven most of the province's largest companies into bankruptcy. In Nova Scotia, federal funds provided the basis for the reorganization of National Sea Products, which had interests in the Newfoundland fi  shery. The Newfoundland government, in cooperation with the federal government and the Bank of Nova Scotia, bailed out the industry by taking over the assets of the fi  rms and consolidating them in Fishery Products International (FPI). Under the leadership of chief executive officer Vic Young, FPI enjoyed initial success, although the industrial restructuring  did  not  overcome  the  problems  of  overcapacity  and dwindling fi  sh  stocks  that  were  becoming  more  evident  with  each passing year. 17

In the same year, the provincial government's efforts to get a better deal from the Churchill Falls development project encountered a major setback when the Supreme Court of Canada, setting aside an earlier favourable ruling of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal, ruled that Newfoundland did not have the constitutional authority to enact its Water Reversion Act, legislation designed to recall water rights from the Churchill Falls Corporation. Such a recall might have forced Hydro Quebec to renegotiate the unfavourable hydro contract. If these developments were not bad enough, the next year the exhausted zinc and copper mines at Buchans closed, throwing miners out of work and placing the town in economic crisis. 18

The  offshore  oil  sector  was  the  only  area  in  which  the  provincial  government appeared able to make any headway. In February 1985, the Newfoundland government signed an agreement with the federal  government  on  how  they  would  jointly  manage  the  development  of  offshore  hydrocarbon  resources.  The  Progressive  Conservative government of Brian Mulroney recognized the Government of  Newfoundland  and  Labrador's  equal  say  over  the  management of offshore oil and gas resources through a Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board and acknowledged the province's right to collect revenues from the exploitation of those resources as if it took place on land. Soon after this Atlantic Accord, Peckford, with federal minister John Crosbie, announced that Mobil Oil would establish oil production at the Hibernia site by using fi  xed concrete platforms. Furthermore, the federal government would contribute 75 per cent of a $300 million development fund to allow the province to prepare for industrial growth. The developments in the offshore oil sector contributed signifi  cantly to Peckford's victory in the general election in April.  Nonetheless,  the  fi  sheries,  forestry,  and  mining  sectors  were troubled by downturns in international markets, global restructuring, and resource depletion locally. Without the fi  nancial resources to do much more than attempt to regulate more local control over development, and with so much of the natural-resource sector controlled by external corporate interests such as Bowaters in forestry, the Iron Ore Company of Canada in mining, and the Bank of Nova Scotia in fisheries, or by federal authorities as in the case of fi  sheries, Peckford was becoming a neo-nationalist Don Quixote, railing against the big foreign interests that allegedly were holding the province back. 19

Although  the  developments  in  the  offshore  oil  sector  promised future economic benefi  ts, the provincial economy was in bad shape in  the  mid-1980s.  The  international  recession,  which  had  been  ac-

celerating since the late 1970s, struck hard at a province dependent on industrial staple production in forestry, mining, energy, and the troubled  fi  sheries.  With  the  labour-intensive  construction  stage  of industrial  megaprojects,  such  as  in  hydro  development,  over,  and as mining, forestry, and fi  sh companies dealt with the recession by increasing  productivity  through  mechanization,  with  attendant  job losses and pay cuts, the province's working class bore the brunt. The Progressive Conservatives proved that they were not much different from the Smallwood Liberals in the days of the IWA strike by siding with corporate interests against the union movement. In 1984, for example, the government passed Bill 37 to void a Labour Standards Board decision in favour of Wabush iron ore miners, members of the United Steelworkers of America. The board had found that Wabush Mines had failed to give proper notice to miners in 1981 during a layoff and had ordered it to pay $750,000 in back wages. Similar cases were pending against Fisheries Products International and Advocate Mines at Baie Verte. The bill eliminated the need for more notice and appeased Kruger Corporation, which was considering purchasing the Bowaters mill at Corner Brook. Kruger agreed with the province to take over the mill late in 1984. Bill 52, the Kruger Act, provided the company with $64 million in provincial grants, loan guarantees, and sales tax relief, but Kruger would not have been interested if Bill 37 had not absolved it of $6.7 million in back wages that had been owed to improperly laid-off Bowaters' workers.

At the same time, the province was embroiled in a battle with the Newfoundland Association of Public Employees (NAPE) over Bill 59, an Act to Amend the Public Services (Collective Bargaining) Act, 1973. The bill, passed in 1983, made more provincial employees ineligible for union membership, changed the designation of essential employees, and limited the right to strike, especially by outlawing rotating strikes. Having failed in challenging Bill 59 in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, 5,500 public sector workers went on strike on 3 March 1986. They returned to work after a month, but 5,000 went on strike again in September when the government did not back down from the intentions of Bill 59. The Canadian Labour Congress became involved, and Bill 59 eventually earned the criticism of the International Labor Organization of the United Nations. 20

The Peckford government's anti-union stance was compatible with the neo-nationalism it often espoused. Its defence of a 'traditional' rural Newfoundland against the impact of modernity was partially an attack on the manner in which the development of the welfare state had

supposedly eroded the self-reliant producer values of simple outport folk. In response to NAPE's failed legal challenge to Bill 59, Memorial University philosopher F.L. Jackson, muse and occasional apologist for the Peckford government, attacked the union's president, Fraser March, as a traitorous fi  fth columnist who was undermining the true Newfoundland. As unemployment increased, government cutbacks deepened, and the cost of living rose, the people who were the economic backbone of the towns and cities of the province, government employees and others whose paycheques and salaries came from a public source, found Peckford's anti-welfare message appealing. The state, the premier argued, had no business taxing such people to pay for welfare and make-work projects in rural Newfoundland and Labrador. Something had to be done to save the people of the province from the moral rot of welfare dependency. 21

In  the  spring  of  1985  Peckford  appointed  the  Royal  Commission on Employment and Unemployment (RCEU) and invited sociologist Doug House of Memorial University  to  chair  it.  Throughout  rural Newfoundland and Labrador, the provincial and federal governments, often through the intermediaries of local rural development associations, relied on government-fi  nanced make-work programs to qualify people for unemployment insurance. As the recession worsened, the cycles of make-work programs and unemployment insurance barely allowed rural people to keep body and soul together, let alone produce any meaningful economic development. Keeping in mind that unemployment and government retrenchment were acute Canadian problems in the 1980s, the report argued that rural people would face uncertain futures if they continued to require government assistance and make-work projects to generate signifi  cant, if short-term, employment. The RCEU also realized that the offshore oil sector was unlikely to generate enough employment to address the needs of rural parts of the province, and fi  sheries, forestry, and mining as practised were not going to be of much greater help. Balanced development of urban centres and rural areas of Newfoundland and Labrador would be achieved, the RCEU suggested, if governments adopted an ambitious, twenty-point program that included consolidation and reform of existing natural-resource industries; greater investment in the inshore fishery;  continued  promotion  of  offshore  oil  and  gas  development; the advancement of agriculture and aquaculture; the expansion of the service sector and tourism; and the provision of better infrastructure and governance that were sensitive to the needs of Labrador and First Nations. The report further recommended an ambitious program of

public investment in people through better education; labour-market and entrepreneurial development policies for women and youth; income-security policies; investment in public education at every level; and a more participatory Labour Relations Tribunal. Underpinning all of the RCEU's recommendations was its belief that every order of government must use all means possible to facilitate community and regionally based development. 22

By 1987, the Peckford regime was experiencing its own problems. Misinterpreting the Royal Commission's recommendation to invest in long-lasting infrastructure, Peckford became involved with Alberta promoter  Philip  Sprung,  who  was  promoting  hydroponic  technology.  The  government  became  enmeshed  in  an  ill-thought-out  plan to make Newfoundland and Labrador a major player in the tomato and cucumber markets of the province and Atlantic Canada, committing $14,325,000 and improper loan guarantees to the purchase and construction of one of Sprung's facilities. The provincial government carried out no proper market studies and did not properly supervise the project. A later provincial royal commission, chaired by Hon. Mr. Justice S. O'Regan, concluded that the Peckford government lacked the expertise to become involved in the venture, took no steps to seek such expertise, and was unjustifi  ed in taking almost complete fi  nancial responsibility for the foolhardy scheme. 23

While provincial affairs were beginning to look bad for Peckord, he continued to fi  ght for a better federal-provincial arrangement for the management of local resources, advancing this cause through provincial support for the constitutional change proposed at Meech Lake in 1987. The main factor contributing to the development of the Meech Lake proposal was the ongoing concern about Quebec remaining outside the process that had led to the repatriation of the Constitution in 1982. The Meech Lake Accord, the result of a meeting of premiers and the Canadian prime minister at the federal retreat of Meech Lake, proposed constitutional amendments that would (1) recognize Quebec as a distinct society in Canada, (2) assure the decentralization of federal spending power and authority in matters such as immigration, (3) give veto power to all provinces in future constitutional amendments, (4) provide greater provincial infl  uence over the composition of the Supreme Court, and (5) establish mandatory regular fi  rst ministers' conferences to discuss economic and constitutional matters.

The Peckford government supported the accord because it hoped that the agreement to decentralize federal spending power and authority  might  provide  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  with  greater

power to place provincial priorities at the fore of future fi  sheries and offshore energy development, as well as in any other area that might otherwise be the preserve of the federal government. Peckford did not see Meech Lake as an ideal solution; in areas such as Senate reform that would give the provinces more say about federal policy, Meech Lake was, at best, vague, and moreover, it recognized social distinctiveness largely on a linguistic basis for Quebec, not on the basis of other  historical  processes.  Nonetheless,  the  provincial  government wanted to be able to opt out of federal programs but still have access to equivalent federal resources to develop policies that would suit the development needs of Newfoundland and Labrador.

This  was  a  diffi  cult  position  to  take.  The  failure  of  most  of  the province's development strategies since 1949 made it dependent on federal welfare-state policies in health, social assistance, and education to maintain a quality of life in keeping with minimum Canadian standards.  The  provisions  for  decentralization  of  spending  powers did not excuse provinces such as Newfoundland and Labrador from designing programs that would deliver services to residents that were as  good as those available elsewhere in Canada; rather, the accord would give the province greater freedom to design programs of delivery  that  made  sense  in  the  local  context  rather  than  conforming to models derived elsewhere. As long as federal funds fl  owed freely through transfer payments from richer provinces to poorer ones, this issue  of  local  control  probably  did  not  matter  much.  But  the  1980s had been a time of federal and provincial retrenchment, in which the disproportionate social and economic vulnerability of provinces such as Newfoundland and Labrador had made clear that they could not continue to meet national objectives in areas such as health care without some greater provincial autonomy.

National constitutional debates were not enough to save Peckford. The signs of economic distress seemed to be everywhere in the late 1980s, perhaps the most visible of which was the federal government's decision in 1988, with the blessing of Peckford, to fi  nally shut down that  icon  of  earlier  Newfoundland  nationalism,  the  Newfoundland railway. 24 In 1989, in the wake of the failure of the Sprung project, with unemployment continuing to soar, and with the province's fi  nancial situation  worsening  steadily,  Peckford  resigned  as  premier.  Briefl  y succeeded by Tom Rideout, the Progressive Conservatives fell to the Liberals led by Clyde Wells in the general election of April 1989.

Premier Wells took a much different stand on constitutional issues. A fi  scal conservative but strong federalist, the new premier opposed

the distinct society clause of the Meech Lake Accord because he felt it would allow Quebec governments to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and would privilege the legislative status of Quebec within Confederation. The federal government must, Wells felt, preserve its ability to treat all provinces equally and fairly; provinces would be best advised to ensure that they were heard equally through reform of the Senate. Otherwise, the federal government had to preserve its ability to provide essential services to all Canadians, but by being as frugal as possible to assist economic development in the private sector. The popular support he garnered within his own province and across Canada came from those who saw him as another provincial little guy standing up to Prime Minister Mulroney's bullies in Ottawa, or from people who thought of Mulroney as a tool of Quebec. Here, in Wells's stand against Meech Lake, was a chance to get back at the province that had for so long been enjoying the benefi  ts of Labrador's Churchill Falls power development. Finally, there were those who genuinely believed that Newfoundland and Labrador, like the other poor provinces, could not afford to lose the redistributive functions of the federal government over national wealth. All of this sustained  Wells  through  intense  political  pressure  in  1990  to  give Newfoundland's support to the accord by a vote in the House of Assembly, but opposition to the accord in Manitoba made the question moot. 25

In the same year, one of the last vestiges of the former close relationship between the church and state disappeared with the closure of the Mount Cashel Orphanage in St John's due to a public scandal about child abuse within its walls. From the beginning, Mount Cashel had been run by the Christian Brothers of Ireland, an infl  uential Roman Catholic teaching order in St John's. For years, many residents of the city included the institution's annual Christmas fundraiser, the 'Mount Cashel Raffl  e,' as part of their seasonal festivities. However, by the mid-1970s the Order and authorities in the Department of Social Services suspected that at least some of the brothers had engaged in physical and/or sexual abuse of the boys in their charge; in 1974, offi  cials within the Irish Christian Brothers and the provincial Department of Justice had come to an arrangement that shut down an investigation by the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary.

The  scandal  dogged  the  church,  forcing  Archbishop  Alphonsus Penney to appoint the Honourable Gordon Winter, a former lieutenant governor, to head a commission of investigation which built on the Constabulary investigation and a provincially appointed commis-

sion in 1989. The provincial commission had substantiated the allegations of abuse and recommended that the Constabulary be freed from political interference by the Department of Justice and that the Irish Christian Brothers' victims be compensated in timely fashion by the province. The Order apologized to the victims in 1992, but the province paid no compensation until 1996. 26

The  provincial  economy  continued  to  be  troubled,  even  though four  oil  companies  agreed  to  develop  the  Hibernia  oil  fi  eld  under the Atlantic Accord. In 1991, the provincial government established a  program of retrenchment in public fi  nances. Most labour leaders had welcomed a change in government amid the disintegration of the Progressive  Conservative  regime  and  its  labour  policies,  but  Wells believed that governments had little positive role to play in economic development and that the private sector must be unchained from burdensome taxes and cumbersome regulations to create wealth. In his earlier vigorous attacks on federal programs such as unemployment insurance for creating a culture of welfare dependence among Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, Peckford had paved the way for such thinking. Now government programs and public spending were to  be  reduced  and  the  working  people  of  the  province  supposedly made more self-reliant. 27

Wells's March budget contained massive cutbacks in government spending, imposed wage freezes for public employees, cancelled pay equity agreements to redress gender discrimination in the health sector, and, in many cases, reneged on existing union contracts. Led by NAPE, the public sector unions dogged the premier with a 'Clyde Lied' campaign and reminded the public about the pay supplement of over $90,000 a year that Wells had insisted upon receiving when he agreed to be leader of the Liberal Party while it was in opposition. The unions felt that his government had been duplicitous in negotiating some thirty-fi  ve collective agreements providing for 22.9 per cent wage increases over three years and then intending to undermine the increases by introducing Bill 16, the Public Sector Restraint Act. A coalition of unions mounted a legal fi  ght against the government, and the government tried to appease the labour movement by introducing legislation later in the year to prohibit 'double-breasting' (a practice in the building and construction trades whereby unscrupulous contractors would shut down unionized companies and then reopen as non-union organizations to avoid their obligations to collective agreements). The government defended its budget on the grounds that it could not afford a $114 million defi  cit, of which it was saving about

$55 million by its actions. Although the union movement's solidarity in opposition to Wells was unprecedented, it did not translate into support  for  the  NDP,  and  the  government  continued  its  austerity measures in subsequent budgets. 28

Premier  Wells's  commitment  to  retrenchment  and  federalism shaped the nature of rural development in the province. In 1989, soon after his election, Wells created the Economic Recovery Commission (ERC), with Doug House as its chairperson. The ERC was to revitalize the Newfoundland and Labrador economy along the lines set out by the RCEU. Existing rural development initiatives relied heavily on funding from Ottawa, through federal-provincial cooperation agreements, but the federal government, like the province, wanted to reduce spending. In 1994, the two levels of government established the Task Force on Community Economic Development, which recommended a  community-based approach to further economic development. In keeping with the fi  scal conservatism of governments at the time, and based on the belief that make-work programs were actually stifl  ing individual initiative from below, the ERC and its agencies, along with regional economic development boards (REDBs) established as recommended by the task force, focused on capacity building. The provincial government hampered the effort by not allowing the REDBs to provide investment capital to new, small business initiatives, and by refusing to allow the ERC to use credit unions to raise local capital. Wells made much of his commitment to using the ERC and the REDBs to engage citizens in economic development, but his commitment to shifting responsibility for economic and social development from the province to community and regional groups coincided with his efforts to reduce public spending and offl  oad spending onto more local levels of government. 29

Hampered by bureaucratic hostility or indifference at the provincial and federal levels, the ERC found it diffi  cult to deliver short-term success stories in the economic context of the early 1990s, and its long-term plans for a fundamental alteration of community economic development threatened many people who depended on UI and the patronage of the make-work system. The ERC proposed in 1994 a guaranteed basic annual income of $3,000 to supplement earnings from any other source, formal (paid and taxed) or informal (non-monetary exchanges of goods and services), along with supplements for education and work. Critics argued that the plan would lower the unemployment insurance benefi  ts large families with multiple wage-earners received and would subsidize low-paying forms of employment, but without

creating an incentive for employers to pay better wages. They felt that it  romanticized the occupational pluralism, informal economy, and merchant credit of pre-Confederation outports as a way to attack the social citizenship of the welfare state, which defi  ned the unemployment insurance system. Engaging in their own romanticized views of the quality of life underwritten by UI, such critics argued that the development approach embodied by the ERC sidestepped hard-nosed analysis of the impact of capitalism on Newfoundland, especially the manner in which corporate interests in industrial staple production drained the province's natural resources even as they demanded that workers make more and more concessions. 30

In  1992,  crisis  struck  the  east  coast  fi  sheries.  The  cod  stocks  collapsed, and the federal government put in place a series of moratoria on ground fi  sheries, which made the ERC's goal of revitalizing rural parts of the province a much harder task. The provincial government had continued to foster overcapacity in the fi  shing industry by licensing  too  many  processing  plants.  The  federal  government  relied  on overly optimistic internal scientifi  c advice or ignored warnings about the impact of over-fi  shing and paid little attention to warnings from a number of fi  shers' organizations. To be fair to federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) offi  cials, the long-term process of fi  sheries modernization had divided communities and created complicated and often contradictory political pressures. For example, small-scale inshore  fi  shers  who  used  cod  traps,  long  lines,  and/or  handlines, resented the higher incomes of the newer dragger owners and their crews. When overall fi  sh catches had begun to drop by the mid-1980s, such resentment focused on the likely ecological damage the more intensive otter trawls were infl  icting on fi  sh stocks and on dragger skippers' use of small-meshed liner nets, which increased cod catches by preventing the escape of small fi  sh through the larger mesh of the trawl nets. 31

The federal government's responses to the closure of the fi  shery in 1992 - fi  rst through the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program (NCARP) and the Atlantic Groundfi  sh Adjustment Program (AGAP), and later through The Atlantic Groundfi  sh Strategy (TAGS) - compensated many people for the roughly 40,000 jobs lost in the fishery by 1993. But fi  shers complained that compensation was insufficient, and training programs were inadequate to convince them to leave the fi  shery permanently. The few people lucky to remain employed in the corporate sector worked longer hours for less money. Many inshore fi  shers survived the moratoria by diversifying the spe-

cies they caught and ranging further offshore in their small craft, although they were prohibited by DFO from building vessels longer than 65 feet. 32

The  social  upheaval  of  the  crisis  in  the  fi  sheries  further  divided coastal communities. As relatively new entrants into fi  shing, for example, women faced federal regulations that limited the entry of new fishers or part-time fi  shers. Moratoria compensation programs, such as NCARP, discriminated against them by paying them lower average compensation than men and rejecting a higher percentage of their claims for assistance. The increasing cleavage of communities along gender lines led many outport women to question the patriarchal conventions of their communities and to participate in groups such as the Newfoundland and Labrador Women's FishNet Organization. These groups explored ways to maintain the social and economic viability of  coastal  communities, but faced a tough battle in getting governments, unions, and other institutions to take women's problems as seriously as those of men. Other divisions grew in coastal communities, particularly as people who were directly affected by the moratoria, such as truckers and workers in businesses that supplied the needs of the fi  shery, received no compensation and came to resent fi  shers and plant workers who did. 33

The  federal  government's  overall  approach  to  fi  sheries  management  throughout  the  1990s  was  to  promote  fi  shers'  withdrawal from the industry and privatization of rights of access to fi  sh stocks through various quota systems. While some fi  shers left the industry through retirement, and others left Newfoundland and Labrador to seek employment in other provinces, many remained to face an uncertain place in reduced fi  sheries. As in the case of women's organizations, rural people generally found the shock of the moratoria to be socially divisive in ways that impeded the collective defence of their communities. For many individuals and families, out-migration for employment and better educations seemed best. Although oil-related industrial development on the Isthmus of Avalon offset local out-migration, it was insuffi  cient to stem the swelling tide of people leaving the province. 34

The fi  sheries crisis, which became known throughout Newfoundland and Labrador as the 'cod moratorium,' or simply the 'moratorium,' focused the anger of fi  shers against the federal government. The producers of popular culture often shaped this anger by playing the neo-nationalist tune, perhaps the best example being the 'Fisherman's Lament' from the self-titled debut album released by the band Great

Big Sea in 1993. In this song, the band spoke of 'brave Newfoundlanders,' hard-working and formerly proud men emasculated by the fisheries mismanagement of 'some government bastard' in Ottawa. Full  of  understandable, if  highly  gendered, indignation against the inadequacy of the federal government's compensation package, the song suggested no awareness of the provincial fi  sheries policies and the expansion of local fi  shing efforts as having played a role in the ecological catastrophe of the ground fi  sheries. Great Big Sea was much more overtly political than such artists as Mary Dalton, whose 1989 collection of poetry, The Time of Icicles , had been partially a pastoral refl  ection on the post-Confederation rural decline of the province, or the songwriter and performer Ron Hynes, whose beautiful 'Atlantic Blue,' written in 1988, had mourned the losses of the Ocean Ranger disaster. Ray Guy had continued to produce much popular and populist  mistrust about the impact of modernization on Newfoundland. All of these artists expressed a profound sense of loss, but with little notion about the part the peoples of the province had played in the many misfortunes of Newfoundland and Labrador, whether in depleted fi  sheries, previous support for Smallwood's modernization, or being bamboozled by the neo-nationalism of Peckford. 35

These  misfortunes  continued,  and  were  perhaps  most  visible  in events  that  unfolded  in  Labrador.  Incidents  involving  children  at Davis Inlet gained national and international media attention in 19923. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the Mushuau Innu of Utshimasits had laboured under the constant intrusion of the Akaneshau, or English speakers, on their culture and society. Although experienced hunters could use snowmobiles to hunt during the winter, it was impossible for the Mushuau Innu to travel as a community to participate in the celebrations of the hunt such as the mokoshan, or ritual feasting, which missionaries had discouraged in any event. The Roman Catholic Church had forbidden the people to communicate with animal spirits through shamans and shaking tent ceremonies. In the latter ceremonies, the Innu had used alcohol with drumming, dancing, and singing; the diminishment of the ritual left only the alcohol. Many people, young and old, turned to substance abuse to cope with the frustration and alienation that characterized Davis Inlet. 36

The national and international media seized on news stories about children dying in a house fi  re in 1992 and the sensational videotape and pictures of Innu children sniffi  ng gasoline in 1993, portraying life among the Mushuau Innu as hopelessly demoralized. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Since the late 1970s, the Innu of all

Labrador had begun to react publicly against the proliferation of lowlevel military fl  ying from the Goose Bay airbase over their territory. From 1985 to 1995, the Innu Nation waged a high-profi  le campaign against low-level fl  ying, building a great deal of international public support. The campaign rallied the Innu of Sheshatshiu and embroiled them in considerable controversy with local residents of Happy Valley-Goose Bay and North West River, who depended on the employment and related economic spin-offs of the military presence. Others felt that the Innu could not legitimately claim traditional rights to their territory  because  they  had  been  forced  to  accommodate  aspects  of Akaneshau life. The Innu of Utshimatsits were less impressed by the struggle, which failed to prevent low-level fl  ying. However, the Mushuau Innu were convinced that the Innu Nation must fi  ght harder for a territorial land claims agreement. They held their own public consultations, achieved federal recognition in principle of their rights to land and resources, and demanded that the provincial government agree to the relocation of their community to Natuashish, at Sango Pond on the Labrador mainland about 15 kilometres west of Utshimatsits. 37

On the island, the closure of the American naval base at Argentia in  1994  only  added to the problems of an area previously hit hard by the shut-down in 1989 of ERCO at nearby Long Harbour, which resulted in the loss of 290 jobs in the Isthmus of Avalon. The bleakness of the 1990s - the scandals generated by abusive Roman Catholic clergy,  constitutional  farce  on  a  national  scale,  massive  unemployment, constant labour unrest, and the crisis of the fi  sheries - helped make the remnant of CODCO a Newfoundland and Canadian phenomenon. As early as 1978, two of its members, Tommy Sexton and Greg  Malone,  had  endeared  themselves  to  Newfoundlanders  and Labradorians with their show The Wonderful Grand Band .  This show combined music and sketches in weekly parody of political fi  gures and the everyday unemployed. In 1987, the CBC aired a weekly show called CODCO ,  featuring  Sexton,  Malone,  Mary  Walsh,  and  Andy Jones. In 1991, Jones wrote a sketch, 'Pleasant Irish Priests in Conversation,' which outlined much of the behaviour that later came to light in the Mount Cashel affair. The CBC refused to air the show, leading to Jones's departure. CODCO declined without Jones and ended in 1993. However, Walsh, with Cathy Jones, Greg Thomey, and Rick Mercer, founded the weekly satirical news show This Hour Has 22 Minutes . 38

In  1994,  public  discontent  with  Wells's  retrenchment  policies mounted when the government announced plans to privatize Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, which many saw as an important

source of revenue for government as well as of cheap electricity for consumers. Wells stepped down as premier in 1996. His successor, Brian Tobin, had recently been in the public spotlight as the federal minister of Fisheries and Oceans when, in 1995, Canadian patrol ships seized the Estai , a Spanish fi  shing vessel that had been illegally catching undersized turbot just outside the 200-mile limit in international waters. Although the legality of the seizure was questionable, and the long-term impact on international fi  sheries conservation was negligible, the incident made Tobin extremely popular.

As the federal cabinet minister from Newfoundland and Labrador, Tobin had been supportive of the initiatives of the ERC and related agencies in rural and regional development. However, as the province's new premier, with a solid mandate in a quick general election, Tobin shut down the whole effort in favour of a reorganized, highly centralized Department of Development and Rural Renewal (DDRR). Unlike Wells, Tobin was much more committed to an older style of federal Liberal spending, pragmatic in using government spending to redistribute wealth to poorer areas, especially if it meant consolidating popular support for the government.

Desperate to fi  nd economic activity outside of the fi  shing industry, and hampered by the political climate of retrenchment, the ERC had focused on an integrated approach to fostering small-scale economic enterprises. While the ERC did not overlook the fi  shery, its approach and modest successes opened it to further charges of impracticality and abandonment of the fi  shing industry. Tobin's reforms brought regional development under direct ministerial control, which was more vulnerable to old forms of patronage politics. While the provincial government continued to make some effort at rural development, the new premier's policies were 'neo-Smallwoodian,' preoccupied with 'resource megaprojects - oil, nickel, and hydroelectricity - rather than with fi  sh and small-scale rural development.' 39

The most important initiatives of the Tobin government had been set  in  motion  during  Wells's  premiership.  Apparent  economic  salvation came in the form of the discovery of massive nickel deposits at  Voisey's  Bay  in  1993.  The  area  of  the  mineral  discovery  encompassed lands claimed by both the Labrador Inuit Association (LIA) and the Innu Nation. The LIA had been negotiating with the federal and provincial governments since 1975 for a land claims settlement, but without much success. The Inuit and the Innu had begun to assert their authority over the land they claimed by exerting control over archaeological research in their territories. In 1992, the Innu Nation had

begun its own permit process for researchers who wished to dig in their land, much to the consternation but eventual resignation of the provincial government. Presented with the opportunity of Voisey's Bay, the LIA and the Innu Nation threatened to bring development to  a  halt  through  court  challenges  and  protests,  eventually  leading to development agreements between the company and both peoples, and greater progress on land claims with the federal and provincial governments. People of Inuit and settler ancestry who lived outside the land claims area of the LIA had founded the Labrador MÃ©tis Association in 1986, later called the MÃ©tis Nation, but made less progress in securing government recognition of their claims. The Tobin government insisted on development of Voisey's Bay in ways that would maximize provincial benefi  ts and employment, leading his successor Roger Grimes to negotiate with Inco an agreement that the corporation would develop an experimental hydrometallurgical smelter near Argentia, Placentia Bay. 40

The Tobin government carried out educational reform that the Wells government had begun and that followed up on recommendations dating back to 1964 that the province should abolish public denominational education. Tobin kept the debate focused on the question of  how the province could deliver the best-quality education to its youth. His government determined to place the education system directly under provincial control and received the support of 73 per cent of voters in a subsequent referendum on the subject in 1997. This vote opened the way in 1998 for a constitutional amendment of term 17 of the province's Terms of Union with Canada, ending its provision for denominational education. 41  The Tobin government was responsible for additional constitutional change when, in 1999, it proposed offi  cially changing the name of the Province of Newfoundland to the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The federal government passed the necessary legislation to effect the name change, which became offi  cial on 6 December 2001.

Grimes became premier in 2001, following Tobin's jump back into federal politics in 2000. A leadership race between Grimes and cabinet colleague John Efford had been bitter and close, leaving behind a divided party. As premier, Grimes was at the head of a Liberal regime that had been in power for thirteen years. With royalties from new developments in offshore oil, such as the White Rose project, and Voisey's Bay still in the future, the Grimes government had to contend with a huge public debt, making the prospect of a budget that would mobilize public support for his government unlikely. Grimes turned

to  the  tried-and-true approach: he claimed that the federal government was unfairly treating the province, particularly in the manner it clawed back revenue from the royalties generated by the exploitation of non-renewable resources through reduced equalization payments. In March, the premier announced a Royal Commission on Renewing and Strengthening Our Place in Canada. The commission went over old ground in decrying the unfairness of the Churchill Falls contract and attributing most of the responsibility for the fi  sheries crisis to Ottawa. The commission emphasized the problems of rural decline, outmigration, and mounting public debt in the province and suggested that a new, more collaborative federal-provincial relationship might be founded on such policies as a reform of the Atlantic Accord to allow Newfoundland and Labrador to retain more of the revenue generated by offshore oil. 42

Grimes failed to rally Newfoundland and Labrador voters to the Liberal banner on the basis of the commission's milquetoast report. Standing against him in the 2003 general election was the charismatic lawyer and cable television tycoon Danny Williams, the new leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. The Progressive Conservatives had co-opted many of the commission's recommendations about a more aggressive provincial stance on its place in Canada in areas such as the fi  sheries, future hydro development in Labrador, and the Atlantic Accord. Williams led his party to a majority government. It was too much to expect that voters would believe that the provincial Liberals, the federalist party of Wells and Tobin, were going to be able to get a better deal from Ottawa. Although voters had seen it all before in the Peckford regime, they were apparently ready to place their hopes in neo-nationalism again in his ideological heir, Danny Williams.

## Conclusion

## Not a Nation

The new Tory government of Danny Williams girded itself to do battle again with Ottawa in the name of a fairer, better deal for Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. It wrung tremendous concessions from Ottawa on the Atlantic Accord in 2005 that, if honoured by the federal government, will provide the province with much more offshore oil revenue. Williams's success provoked the envy of Saskatchewan's premier and the anger of the premier of Ontario, who suggested that it was time that Ontario received a new deal in Confederation. At home, Williams enjoyed tremendous popular support: the province was the regional David standing against Goliath at the centre.

Although the rhetoric of the Williams government put Newfoundland neo-nationalism back in the public eye, it actually delivered little in terms of achieving a better arrangement in the case of offshore oil revenues. What really counted was a weak minority Liberal government in Ottawa that was unable to resist the provincial government's demands amid a federal election campaign. 1  Newfoundland and Labrador seems poised to become 'have' rather than 'have-not,' although it  remains  to  be  seen  to  what  extent  this  will  be  the  result  of  neonationalist rhetoric, a minority federal government that might make further  concessions  to  the  province,  or  the  fortuitousness  of  high prices in the international markets for oil and gas. It further remains to be seen how the people of Newfoundland and Labrador will partake of the benefi  ts of 'have' status for the province. The provincial government continues to project a net population loss for Newfoundland and Labrador, expecting the provincial population, which was

576,495 in 1986, to fall to 500,736 by the year 2022. The government expects the province to lose working-age people, while there will be an absolute increase in the number of people 65 years of age and older. The province's population loss will likely continue to be from rural areas as people fl  ee the decline of the fi  shing industry, while the St John's population, largely fuelled by the revenues from the offshore oil industry, will continue to grow. The concentration of the benefi  ts of 'have' status appears set to take place on the northeast Avalon Peninsula even as the forestry sector continues to be troubled; these conditions challenge the government to fi  nd means to distribute benefi  ts to rural Newfoundland and to its working-age people in particular. Aside from offshore oil, the only other economic opportunities appear to be in the mining and hydro power opportunities of Labrador, which will increase that region's importance. 2

It is doubtful that the people of such a divided Newfoundland and Labrador will fi  nd solutions to their problems in the currently fashionable political rhetoric of neo-nationalism. Recent analyses of this phenomenon have pointed out that the current fascination of eastern urban Newfoundlanders and Premier Williams with the old national pink, white, and green fl  ag has its roots in the older neo-nationalism of D.W. Prowse and Robert Bond. Theirs was the optimism of the old national policy, which promised that Newfoundland would become a modern industrial nation. Contemporary nationalism, however, has a  more  negative  tone,  a  fascination  with  conspiracy  theories  about how Newfoundlanders and Labradorians were tricked into joining Canada, how Canada has not done enough for the province, and how provincehood has undermined cultural identity, blighted the economy, and forced people to leave. It is too easy to succumb to new nationalist fallacies by accepting the notion that the pessimism of the last third of the twentieth century was a reaction against modernity as represented by the failures of the Smallwood regime. This superfi  cial view overlooks the extent to which Smallwood's basic ideas were the logical successors to the nineteenth-century tradition of Prowse and Bond. 3

Nineteenth-century nationalism was out of step with the long-term historical pattern that characterized the experiences of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. Prehistoric peoples depended on their use of coastal marine and estuarine resources, including anadromous fish species such as salmon and coastal fauna such as seabirds. The early Norse explorers who prospected for farmlands to settle along the North Atlantic littoral found no basis for settlement in Newfound-

land. Later European merchants, whale hunters, and fi  shers found rich marine resources to exploit by migratory fi  sheries in the waters off Newfoundland and Labrador, but there were few terrestrial resources to tempt them to found colonies. By the seventeenth century, French and English interests developed colonies, the most impressive being at Plaisance and Ferryland. While colonists bravely attempted to fi  nd landward resources to exploit, and all colonies depended on supplementary farming, these ventures were primarily of military and economic strategic importance. The colonies staked rival empires' claims to Newfoundland or provided a basis from which to protect labour and capital deployed in the fi  shing industry and related maritime activities.  Merchants, gentry-planters, and fi  shing servants settled because they wanted better access to local fi  sheries, needed to protect their establishments from First Nations, or wanted to improve their mercantile position. Year-round settlers found limited opportunities as furriers and wood cutters, but the economic activity that made their lives successful was the spring seal hunt. The limits of lands dominated by cold-ocean coastal, northern boreal, or arctic barrens ecologies meant that there was little terrestrial basis for the type of agriculture that formed the base of successful colonial development elsewhere in North America.

Imperial confl  ict resulted in Newfoundland and Labrador becoming  secure  British  possessions  by  1763,  fostered  the  growth  of  St John's as the centre of British naval administration of the fi  shery and local settlement, but left much of the administration of Labrador to missionaries  and  traders.  Between  1775  and  1815,  the  military  and administrative establishment of the town provided the economic basis for artisans, professionals, and a small shopkeeper bourgeoisie in addition to the extensive mercantile enterprises that dominated the resident fi  shery. Willing to tax residents to pay for the cost of their administration, but unwilling to grant the institutions of colonial self government, the British government wished to maintain much of the structure of naval government in the fi  rst offi  cial provisions for colonial status in 1824. Members of the St John's bourgeoisie, unwilling to accept their lack of control over taxation and patronage, fought for self-government but had to fi  nd  a  means  of  convincing  British  authorities that their demands were justifi  ed.

To answer imperial arguments that Newfoundland had no agrarian  basis  for  colonial  self-government,  colonial  reformers  founded a nationalist myth: that the island had the resources for agricultural diversifi  cation and interior development but that these had been

frustrated by a cabal of self-interested British merchants and naval governors. On its own, this myth had little appeal to the fi  shing people who made up the vast majority of Newfoundland's population. The reformers embellished their appeal by suggesting to servants of Irish Roman Catholic origin in the most densely populated areas of the  Avalon  Peninsula  that  supporting  Reformers  allowed  them  to strike a blow for settlers against a British and Protestant mercantocracy. Anxious to shed the expense of administering Newfoundland, the British conceded representative institutions in 1832, and responsible government in 1855.

Colonial reformers, known as Liberals by the mid-nineteenth century, had raised expectations at home and in London that a colonial government would oversee economic diversifi  cation and prosperity free of dependence on a fi  shery that had been chronically troubled after 1815. The Liberals' myth, popularized and embellished by the writing of Prowse, quickly burdened the colony's politics and policies with a denominational cast, most notably in public education. Over the long run, colonial governments' railway and interior diversifi  cation policies undermined the basis of colonial competency. Unable to count on imperial support for the regulation of the fi  shery, an inherently international economic activity in terms of trade and resources, Newfoundland governments paid scant attention to the management of marine resources. Instead, to varying degrees, they built expensive railway lines, always hoping that some new resource Eldorado might be found at the end of the next line. An extensive agricultural interior never materialized, but there were forestry and mineral resources to be developed if colonial governments were willing to make generous concessions  to  international  corporations.  Most  governments  made the concessions because they were desperate to generate employment. Otherwise,  they  used  railway  employment  and  public  battles  over American or French fi  shing rights to court the voters of the colony. Colonial governments also used tariffs to protect local manufacturing.

Newfoundland's nineteenth-century political elite embraced a national policy of landward economic diversifi  cation that was very similar  to  that  pursued by Canada in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The major difference was that the Canadian proponents of their  National Policy had a well-established industrial heartland in southern Ontario and in parts of Quebec, based on the opportunities of  colonial  agriculture,  and had a huge agricultural hinterland and resource frontier to the north and on the prairies to exploit. Although many in Newfoundland eventually came to see Labrador as such a

hinterland, it  could  not  justify  the  expansion  of  the  railway  on  the island, the key to the nationalist dream.

Nineteenth-century nationalists, in other words, ignored the obvious dependence of the colony on marine resources. Such ignorance is not surprising; Newfoundland never had much effective control over fisheries  policy.  It  depended  on  the  British  for  the  enforcement  of regulations and infl  uence  over  international  competitors.  Although conscientious  enough  in  representing  Newfoundland  interests  in discussions of international trade barriers such as tariffs, the British tended to trade off those interests to the French and the Americans in matters such as fi  shing regulations and territorial rights. Without sufficient fi  scal  resources  to  afford  enforcement of the few regulations they did make, Newfoundland politicians gravitated to the national policy, but it failed. While the government had some success in forestry and mining, these sectors never generated the kind of employment and markets that would support a local manufacturing base or suffi  cient traffi  c to justify the expense of the railway.

It is all too easy to ignore the extent to which popular agency drove colonial nationalism by the turn of the century. Fishers supported the economic diversifi  cation platforms of early reformers because it was an apparent way to break merchants' control over their lives in the fishery.  The  expansion  of  manufacturing,  the  railway,  and  related trades in St John's created an important, if regionally concentrated, working  class.  Although  members  of  that  class,  especially  skilled workers, formed unions to negotiate better employment conditions, they knew that their economic interests lay with the national policy, and colonial politicians often saw political opportunity in using railway construction as a form of patronage to court workers' support.

All this does not mean that fi  shing people and the working class were simply dupes of the colonial elite. Their history is replete with examples of collective actions aimed at protesting exploitation or of building alternative ideological visions in popular piety and evangelical religious traditions. However, the strength of the national policy, by widening the gulf between town and country, by setting the interests of industrial workers against fi  shers, ensured that there would be little  popular support in St John's for the single most important pre-Confederation effort to better manage the fi  shery, the regulations proposed by Coaker of the FPU in 1920-1.

Ironically, the national policy delivered Newfoundland, although perhaps not Labrador, into the hands of those who would later become  the  antagonists  of  the  neo-nationalists.  The  policy  created

massive public railway debt. This debt, aggravated by the high cost Newfoundland paid to participate in the First World War, contributed to the fi  nancial crisis and surrender of self-government in 1934. The severity of the postwar recession in the fi  shery revealed just how shallow and fragile economic diversifi  cation was. Already antagonized by  wartime  infl  ation  and  suspicions  of  profi  teering  by  merchants, workers and fi  shers  felt  betrayed  by  politicians,  suspected  them  of corruption, and were disillusioned with the outcome of years of economic boosterism and patronage. Like many in the business community, workers and fi  shers were ready for a rest from democracy and accepted the Commission of Government.

For all  of  its  ambitious,  if  misguided,  plans  for  social,  economic, and moral reform, the Commission of Government served primarily as  midwife  to  Newfoundland  and  Labrador's  union  with  Canada. This does not mean that the commission broke with the nationalist past.  Notwithstanding its  experiments  with  model  settlements  and administrative reform, the commission essentially followed the same desperate program of economic diversifi  cation, especially in forestry and mining, as had past governments. Like previous responsible governments, the commission showed little sympathy for the plight of the unemployed, workers, and their unions and committees, and did little to alleviate the depression of the 1930s. Likewise, its refusal to implement the Gorvin plans for cooperative reform of the rural economy revealed that the commission was uninterested in challenging mercantile power in the fi  shery.

The impact of the Second World War provided economic opportunities and improved living standards where responsible governments and the commission had failed. The economy and the fi  nancial condition of the Newfoundland government improved because of military spending and wartime demand for salt fi  sh. The commission realized that the latter would not last and had already begun a program of fisheries  modernization  based  on  the  Canadian  model  that  would continue under Smallwood in Confederation.

Government spending, in the form of base construction and operations, had provided many Newfoundlanders and Labradorians with much better lives than had any of the old nationalist policies for economic development. The exigencies of war helped to revitalize the organized labour movement. Many of its leaders joined with rural people to support Smallwood in the fi  ght for Confederation. They did so because they realized that the proponents of a return to responsible government had little to offer except for the empty promises and bro-

ken dreams of a faded and tattered nationalist past. Confederation, on the other hand, offered fi  nancial support for expanding government services and programs, which would fi  ll the gap left by the loss of  wartime  spending  in  Newfoundland  and  Labrador.  Smallwood otherwise took up the same basic program of industrial diversifi  cation, fi  rst by manufacturing schemes and then by industrial-staple development. The premier found, as had others before him, that it was extremely  diffi  cult  to  secure  the  development  of  natural  resources without striking unbalanced agreements with foreign investors and other  governments.  Anxious  to  secure  investment,  Smallwood  betrayed the working people who had supported him, most notably in his ruthless repression of the IWA in 1958-9. For Smallwood, like the Commission of Government before him, loggers and other working people were primarily labour resources to be used in courting corporate investment. Such workers were supposed to acquiesce to their compliant role in the building of a nation but found that their own interests meant they had to demand more.

Although he carried on in the tradition of the nineteenth-century nationalists,  Smallwood's  fl  awed  economic  programs,  his  political megalomania, his apparent resource giveaways, as in the case of the Churchill Falls contract, and increased dependency on federal transfers,  made  Confederation the target for a new generation of politicians. It was easy to blame Canada for failures in provincial policies that contributed to crisis, even in areas of inordinate federal authority such as fi  sheries management. The retrenchment policies of every order of government in the 1970s and 1980s led to public resentment about program and employment cutbacks in the province, which politicians could easily redirect at Ottawa. Politicians from both provincial parties have appreciated the local political capital that accumulates from public, often vicious battles with Ottawa. Peckford's battles with Trudeau over control of Newfoundland's offshore oil resources had their antecedent in Smallwood's battle over term 29. Clyde Wells was not straying far from the fi  eld in his fi  ghts against the Meech Lake and Charlottetown constitutional  proposals,  which  distracted  from his  confrontation  at  home  with  public  sector  workers.  While  Wells became  something  of  a  Canadian  hero  for  his  staunch  federalism, it is easy to overplay his distinction from Peckford. Peckford's antiTrudeau appeal in many parts of Canada was considerable, as was Wells's popularity at home as an Ottawa-basher. In every instance, Newfoundland premiers redirected popular anger over their anti-labour and fi  scally conservative policies at a federal bogeyman.

The rhetoric of neo-nationalism in Newfoundland ignores the manner in which neo-nationalist ideals discount the experiences of class, gender, ethnic, and regional divisions. These divisions render meaningless the concept of a Newfoundland nation. As one grieving mother of a worker lost on the Ocean Ranger said of the provincial government, 'They want to get on with the job of making big bucks and we are an irritant to them to be disposed of as quickly as possible. When it comes to human life and dignity, it seems they don't care a great deal.'  Nor are members of the working class of Newfoundland and 4 Labrador the only ones who ill fi  t the idealization of the beleaguered Newfoundland national cause. The First Nations of those lands now within the province's geopolitical boundaries have never had a place in this nationalism. There is perhaps no better illustration of this than the continued use of the Churchill Falls hydro development as a rallying  cry  for  nationalism.  Time  and  again,  Newfoundland political leaders have played on an island-based sense of grievance over the deal  between  Brinco  and  Hydro  Quebec.  Premier  Brian  Tobin,  as just one recent example, justifi  ed his government's tough stance on the  development of Voisey's Bay by stating that 'Churchill Falls is a scar on the psyche of Newfoundland and Labrador, and until we demonstrated that we could negotiate good deals we would never be able to set aside the belief that we had been scuppered yet again.' In contrast with Tobin's views, consider the observation of Marie Wadden in her study of the Innu fi  ght against low-level fl  ying: 'The Innu not only lived, hunted and travelled over land now underwater [the Smallwood Reservoir], they also buried their dead there, and carefully  marked sites where children were born and where legendary and heroic deeds had occurred. The fl  ooding of graves is considered a blasphemous act by many Innu.' 5

While  the  fortunes  of  such  First  Nations  have  varied,  they  have all had to struggle against the subjugation embedded in the colonial approach of the Newfoundland elite to their rights. The anguish of the oppression of one people by another was abundantly clear in the views of the Mushuau Innu: 'We have been discriminated against by the government. They don't care about us. Our voices are not heard. White people always have their way. We are far behind other communities. Some of us think the government doesn't see us as human beings. They think we are animals and we don't know how to run our lives. They want to control everything in our community. They think we are too lazy. They are racist.'  Nonetheless, national oppression 6

does not mean helplessness, and the Innu have successfully used their own national consciousness and organization to force concessions for themselves and Labrador, to the contrary of long-held expectations by many in Newfoundland that Labrador was little more than a treasure store of resources for the island's benefi  t.

The development of Voisey's Bay is an example of what may be achieved  once  people  become  conscious  of  their  real  interests  and pursue them in a determined way. The benefi  ts agreements negotiated by the LIA and the Innu Nation are the fi  rst time that the natural resources of Labrador have been developed in a way that satisfi  ed local  people.  However,  even  in  this  case,  national  identity  has  its limits, and potential social divisions remain hidden by an uncritical acceptance of national analyses. In the case of the LIA, for example, Inuit women, represented by the Tongamuit Innut Annait, held workshops in 1998 about the manner in which they felt marginalized by the process of land claims negotiations. Women from Nain, Makkovik, Postville, Hopedale, and Rigolet spoke about how they felt that male negotiators from the LIA and the federal and provincial governments were more interested in the industrialization of natural resources than in the social and cultural impacts of such development. Arguing that they would bear the brunt of such impacts, women wanted negotiators to consider the impact of land claims and industrial development on their lives. For example, women argued that full-time work at Voisey's Bay might undermine families' spending time together on the land, deprive them of traditional foods, and foster divisions among families and communities. 7

Recent neo-nationalism continues to distract the peoples of Newfoundland  and  Labrador  from  its  real  impact  on  their  lives.  Craig Dobbin, for example, one of Newfoundland's leading capitalists, was well-known for his 'remarkable' and 'passionate' articulation of provincial grievance in the case of the Newfoundland and Labrador government's battles with the federal government over the distribution of  revenues  from  non-renewable  natural-resource  exploitation  and federal equalization programs. 8 But consider Dobbin's actions as opposed to his rhetoric. In 2004, while maintaining his public position that Newfoundland was getting a raw deal from Confederation and would be better off controlling its own natural resources, Dobbin's company, Canadian Helicopters Corporation, moved its head offi  ce from St John's to Vancouver. Dobbin admitted that he was too embarrassed to speak to the press about his action, but defended the move

as an act of international corporate concentration and rationalization. ''Why Vancouver and not St John's?' 'Because I had 350 people in Vancouver already working out there and I had 35 in St John's.'' 9

In the same year, the Williams government used what the United Nations' International Labor Organization (ILO) termed 'harsh' legislation  to  order  thousands  of  members  of  the  Newfoundland  and Labrador  Association  of  Public  Employees  (NAPE)  back  to  work following a bitter  public  sector  strike.  The  legislation  established  a wage freeze and extracted contract concessions from the public sector workers. The premier's support for the back-to-work legislation, which NAPE president Carol Furlong called 'an autocratic approach to collective bargaining' and 'a fl  agrant disregard to the human rights of our members and the basic principles of freedom of association,' earned the government of Newfoundland and Labrador its third censure in 2005 by the United Nations body. Nonetheless, the premier's subsequent public battles with the federal government over offshore oil  revenues  and  equalization  programs  have  eclipsed  Williams's treatment of NAPE in the public eye as his government continues to be popular. 10

Nationalism is an ideological construct partially based on the fabrication that peoples of diverse interests are really one and should mobilize in support of a particular interest group or party. Newfoundland and Labrador is the home of a variety of people who, on a day-to-day basis within the context of their communities, are defi  ned far more by their class, gender, and ethnicity than by the mythical nationalist identities invented by political elites. Since Confederation, politicians have used a particular form of neo-nationalist Ottawa-bashing to distract the people of Newfoundland and Labrador from the failures of provincial policies and to co-opt their support. Yet the supposed failings of Confederation for Newfoundland and Labrador - economic dependency  and  underdevelopment,  the  undermining  of  a  'traditional'  outport culture, the depletion of natural resources, and outmigration - are all problems that predate Smallwood and union with Canada. The problems have their origins in the nationalist policies of the nineteenth century. The ecological constraints that were the material reality of life for most of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador provided scarce leeway for determining how the resources of a largely cold-ocean coastal environment might be used. The resources of the sea were paramount, but they have rarely been at the centre of Newfoundland development policies. Instead, governments ignored the slender margin by making generous concessions and regulating

## Conclusion 297

the labour market to court foreign capital investment in what were for the most part much less promising landward developments. To be sure, the forestry and mining industries generated limited employment, profi  ts for investors, and revenue for governments, but that has yet to be balanced against the costs in the depletion of woodlands, environmental degradation, and the industrial carnage in communities such as St Lawrence. The offshore oil industry may be the economic saviour of Newfoundland and Labrador, but that depends on whether the province may use the wealth generated by the industry to invest in people and communities in ways that sustain both them and the ecologies in which their fortunes are inextricably bound.

- 3  A common misunderstanding about servants' preferred lien against their insolvent planter-masters' catches is that the law obliged planters' supplying merchants to pay the wages of their clients. Merchants, in fact, only had to pay wages rateably with the amount of fi  sh and cod oil the planter traded. If, for example, a planter owed fi  ve servants Â£20 each in wages, but together they had caught and traded to a merchant only Â£50 in produce before the master became insolvent, then the merchant only had to pay the servants Â£10 each. The merchant was not responsible for the unpaid wage balances. On the actual application of the law see Cadigan, Hope and Deception , 109-11, 148-50; Cadigan, 'Merchant Capital, the State, and Labour,' 17-42.

## Bibliography

While I have read widely in the literature about Newfoundland and Labrador, I have appended only a list of the specifi  c works I have cited in the text. Readers may also wish to consult the Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website, http:/ /www.heritage.nf.ca/, which began under the direction of James K. Hiller. Olaf U. Janzen compiles and updates regularly a very useful 'Reader's Guide to the History of Newfoundland and Labrador to 1869,' which is available at http:/ / www.swgc.mun.ca/nfl  d\_history/index.htm. The most important resource for anyone interested in reading further on any aspect of Newfoundland and Labrador is the Centre for Newfoundland Studies Queen Elizabeth II Library, at Memorial University. Readers may search its catalogue and periodical article bibliography at http:/ /www.library.mun.ca/qeii/cns/index.php.
