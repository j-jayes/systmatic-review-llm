## Mechanized Agriculture: Machine Adoption; Farm Size, and Labor Displacement

Andrew Schmitz and Charles B. Moss University of Florida

## Introduction

Mechanization in such countries as the United States and Canada has dramatically reshaped the agricultural landscape since the time of early settlement. However, in some parts of the world, agriculture is still highly labor intensive. Mechanization has had a major impact on the demand and supply for farm labor; the profitabil ity of farming; and the change in the rural landscape, including rural communities \_ The introduction of new and gainers For example, the introduction of the mechanical tomato har vester in California   created considerable  controversy, primarily due to farm workers not being compensated

In this article, we highlight several mechanical innovations that include the tomato harvester, cotton stripper and picker, sugarcane harvester, combine, lettuce harvester; orange harvester, zero-tillage air seeder, high clearance   sprayer, small farm equipment (e.g. Leon dozer blade, balers and handlers , and rock pickers) , con centrated livestock   operation   equipment, and green house nursery operations \_ There are others not included , such as tobacco harvesting . grain

## Factors Affecting Farm Labor Demand

We focus on the demand for labor at the farm and at packing and processing levels We do not discuss the demand for workers employed in other sectors of culture (e.g-, machine, fertilizer, and chemical manufacturers) . agri-

There are two general types of agricultural labor in the United States and other developed countries: owneroperator (or farm household labor)   and hired labor.

Mechanization in such countries as the United States and Canada has dramatically reshaped the agricultural landscape since the time of early settlement.  The introduction of new technologiessuch as the mechanical tomato harvester; grain combines, and large four-wheel-drive tractors has resulted in an increase in both farm size and agricultural output; a decrease in the demand for farm labor, and the demise of rural comunities The adoption of new technologies results in losers and gainers; a debate centers around whether losers should be compensated. Agricultural labor includes workers that are employed in packing and processing plants in which wages are generally low (somewhere near the minimum wage) and working conditions are less than desirable\_

Mechanization   affects both sources of labor but in slightly different ways. Mechanization tends to expand the reach of owner-operator labor, resulting in larger farms (i.e exploiting economies of scale) . Mechaniza tion that replaces hired labor focuses on replacing labor in high-valued crops such as fruits and vegetables. At the beginning of the 20th century, this replacement led to debates about labor-push or labor-pull   where tural labor was used in the growing industrial sector\_ agricul-

Since a major issue is the displacement of labor as a result of agricultural mechanization, we highlight  the economic theory behind the choice to adopt agricultural mechanization. In this   context, we  hypothesize two types of agricultural labor. The first type of agricultural labor is labor hired by the farm These individuals are variety of agricultural labor   contracts are wages Or piecemeal rates) , hired  workers do not have an equity share in the output The second type of labor is that of the owner-operator This labor earns a residual  return instead of an hourly wage rate \_ The complication is that this residual return also includes the return to other fac tors provided by the sole-proprietor (i.e capital invested , management, and risk-bearing capital) . In gen eral, the supply of either hired or household labor is dependent on the tradeoff between the marginal utility of income versus the marginal utility of leisure.2 paid
