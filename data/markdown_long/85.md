A number of people have contributed in different ways to the production of this book,
which began as a doctoral thesis. I am greatly indebted to my supervisors at Monash
University, Marian Aveling and Graeme Davison, who provided expert criticism and
support. Lenore Layman was also generous and helpful, patiently reading and criticising
earlier drafts. I am also indebted to my thesis examiners, Ann Curthoys and Stuart
Macintyre, for their constructive and encouraging comments. I would like too to thank
Janet Mackenzie and the staff at Cambridge University Press, especially Phillipa
McGuinness and Robin Derricourt, and the series editors, for their help and support.

Fellow postgraduates and staff members at both Monash University and the Univer¬
sity of Melbourne provided a stimulating and supportive environment in which to
research and write. I wish to thank all those people who shared ideas and material with
me, especially Verity Burgmann, Eddie Butler-Bowdon, Joy Damousi, Mimi Colligan,
Bradon Ellem, Jane Elliott, Charlie Fox, Diane Kirkby, Marilyn Lake, Jenny Lee, Mandy
Leveratt, Sara Maroske, John Mathews, Melanie Raymond, Julie Wells and Evan Willis.

This project would not have been possible without the rich deposits of union records
available, and I am grateful to each of the unions which granted me access to their records.
The staffs of the State Libraries of Victoria and Western Australia were always co-operative
and helpful, as was Marian Letcher at the Carringbush Regional Library. Archivists at the
University of Melbourne Archives and the ANU Archives of Business and Labour gave ser¬
vice well beyond their official duties. Dick Curlewis, archivist for the Printing and Kindred
Industries Union, was likewise generous with his time and assistance.

The research for the thesis was funded by a Commonwealth Postgraduate Research
Award and Monash University. Needless to say, I am grateful to both the Australian
Government and to Monash.

On a more personal note, I wish to thank the following people who have in different
ways helped me during this project: Maryon Allbrook, Giselle Byrnes, John Cook and
Nancy Lane, Suzanne Cross, Karina and Mehmet Adil, Trish Crawford, 'Tucky'
Davidson, Margaret and Ivor de Souza, Diana Elliott, Chervl and Patrick Farrell, Chris¬
tine and Bob Fleming, Jan Gothard, Denise Hill, Violet Jeffkins, John Leckie, Margaret
McClure, Barry Reay, Athina Tsoulis, Hans and Sarah Van Dyk, Shayleen Thompson
and Margaret Steadman. Eddie Scates came to my rescue on several occasions with
emergency grandchild-care and my sister, Janice Anderson, now deceased, was always
supportive. My children, Alexandra and Bill, could have been much worse!

Three people deserve special thanks for their sustained and unstinting help. My
mother, Frances Anderson, put aside her own life and helped me out after the birth of
mv two children, both born during this time. She also helped us move house/country
more times than any of us care to count. My father, Ray Anderson, was likewise ever
ready to help in countless ways.

Finally, words cannot express my debt to Bruce Scates. Suffice to say that his
emotional, intellectual and practical support both at home and at work gave me the time,
space and strength essential for writing. Perhaps even more importantly, he has given
me faith in Lane's vision of men and women as 'mates, not enemies'.

###### Introduction

Technology can only be understood as the aggregate of a series of social choices made in the past; it
therefore carries the scars of past struggles and compromises.1

Writing the history of work is a political exercise. How we understand the past shapes
our behaviour in the present and our strategies for the future. John Mathews, quoted
above, is concerned to explore appropriate trade union responses to new technologies
and innovations in the labour process. He looks to history for guidance on the outcome
of previous strategies and responses. Nor is he alone in this project. Trade union officials
and workers before him have also looked to history in this way.

Conversely, while employers have been less inclined to look to history for guidance,
they have attempted to construct the past in such a way that it legitimises their own pos¬
ition. The portrayal of improved wages and working conditions as the outcome of
employer-initiated technological innovation is one example.2 By denying the creative role
of workers' struggles over work and its remuneration, employers hope to vindicate the
reorganisation of production as beneficial to workers whilst negating the importance of
workers' responses. History becomes an ideological weapon in the 'struggles and com¬
promises' which determine the nature of work.

Given the reality of these issues, this is no time to abandon 'labour process theory', as
some critics have advocated.3 Rather, historians need to respond to the challenge to
explain and interpret changes to the way in which work is performed and organised by
grounding theory in more empirical research. Harry Braverman's influential book, Labor
and Monopoly Capital, published in 1974, suggested the possibilities of such analysis by
charting the deskilling, or 'degradation', of craft work in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. The interest generated by the so-called 'Bravermania' and its critics


-----

has already produced a plethora of case studies. But despite all this work, the labour
process debate is, as Richard Price put it, still in the exploratory stages. Although mono¬
graphs and case studies have proliferated, they have often been undertaken in isolation
from each other.4 And while it is now generally admitted that Braverman's thesis is
flawed, few attempts have been made to improve it. We still need to know in more detail

how work has changed and, even more importantly, why it has changed. What factors
can be identified as determinants of the nature of work? The historian is well placed to
offer answers to these questions, since a perspective of changes over time is essential to
unravel the dynamics at work. It is to these questions which this book is addressed.

Building on insights from other writers in the debate, I propose a multi-faceted expla¬
nation of change in the labour process. Rather than seeking a single factor which can
account for labour process formation, this book argues that such formations are pro¬
duced by the operation of a set of factors. Thus, labour and product markets, technologi¬
cal developments and the availability of capital all directly affect the labour process to
varying degrees in different historical circumstances. In a more general way, the activities
of organised labour and capital, the state, and racial and gender orders (ideologies and
practices) also influence the way in which work is designed and performed. None of
these factors is, however, the determinant of the labour process. It is not possible to accord
theoretical primacy to any single factor; the precise weighting of each contribution can
only be established empirically. The resolution of this problem will be a central task of
this book. Nevertheless, it can be argued that each factor interacts with the others and,
most importantly, is mediated by the social relations at the point of production. Although
the operation of these factors structures the options available at any given point, the out¬
come is determined by the decisions of management, with greater or less input from
workers. In the final analysis, work is shaped by people.

Within this general framework, there are a number of specific theoretical points in the
labour process debate which require clarification. Braverman contends that industrial
work in capitalist societies since the Industrial Revolution has involved the degradation
of traditional craft skills, and with this degradation has come a 'real subordination of
labour' (in the Marxian sense). He links these changes with the development of capital¬
ism towards monopoly capital, and the quest by the capitalist to control the labour pro¬
cess, the variable part of capital. According to Braverman's analysis, this quest for control
led to three major processes. Firstly, by dividing the processes involved in any task and
having these performed by different individuals, the skill of the worker was thereby
degraded. This ultimately reduced the bargaining power of workers who could no longer
rely on their monopoly of skills as a lever in bargaining, while at the same time standard¬
ising the way in which tasks were performed.

Secondly, the introduction of what became known as scientific management meant
increased control over every detail of the work process. Thus conception and execution
were separated, and knowledge and discretion were removed from the worker. Workers
performed the manual work while mental tasks were reserved to management.

Thirdly, the development and use of new forms of technology increased direct control
of management over production by tying the work process to particular machines. In the
twentieth century Braverman points to the adoption of Frederick Taylor's theories and


-----

methods for factory management as the embodiment of capitalist logic and the major
element in the process of deskilling of the mass of industrial operatives. Taylor was the
most prominent and influential exponent of 'scientific management' in the United States
during the Progressive era.

Subsequent analysis has suggested six major flaws in this argument. Firstly, the
deskilling thesis has been criticised as being too sweeping. Rather than a continuous,
even transformation, it is claimed that the process was in fact much more uneven, involv¬
ing reskilling as well as deskilling. Braverman's notion of the 'traditional craftsman' is
also criticised as being too romantic. Real subordination, it is argued, was possible with¬
out the destruction of craft skills.5

At a more fundamental level, the notion of 'skill' itself is now understood as having
ideological and political dimensions as well as a technical one. That is, skill is socially
constructed in the workplace by the exercise of strategic power by particular groups of
workers. Any discussion of 'deskilling' must specify what concept of skill is being
employed. Is work 'deskilled' when the operatives lose their status or when the technical
content of the work is simplified? For instance, in one sense female bookbinders were
deskilled over the period 1750 to 1800 in that initially their work had been a recognised
apprenticeship trade, with a seven-year period of indenture. After 1780, however, the
status of bookbinding as a skilled trade was undermined by the use of trainee labour
taught on the 'learner system' rather than through an apprenticeship. There had been no
corresponding change in the actual work performed.6

Conversely, in some cases workers can be recognised as skilled workers where the
technical content of their work is of a routine nature. Machine minders in the British
printing industry, for instance, were called 'machine managers' and paid a 'skilled' rate,
while people performing similar work in other industries were regarded as unskilled.7
Are machine minders therefore deskilled?

These cases complicate the more usual application of the term to male craft work
which has been subdivided and mechanised, with or without loss of status and pay for
the worker. Beyond this, there is a major problem in distinguishing between work which
has become 'specialised' as opposed to that which has been 'fragmented'. The former
term refers to the situation where a worker brings a more general expertise to bear in
performing a narrower range of tasks. Fragmentation, on the other hand, refers to a part
of a formerly unified process, performance of which requires no knowledge or experi¬
ence of the process as a whole. Thus, bricklayers who spend their time exclusively con¬
structing elaborate towers would be considered specialists. The labourer who carries the
bricks would be performing fragmented work.8

The distinctions, however, are not always so clear. Some workers can successfully
claim fragmented work as specialised (and therefore more skilled) by insisting on a gen¬
eral period of training before being allocated to a subdivided process. On the other hand,
workers who bring a general training outside the workplace to performance of a particu¬
lar task might not have this general training recognised as skill. For instance, women
who acquire expertise at sewing in the home then enter paid work sewing shirts or
underwear have not been regarded as specialists. Similarly, when such work is
subdivided it is regarded unequivocally as fragmented because of the inability of


-----

workers to define it otherwise. As Cora Baldock has pointed out, 'the issue of deskilling
.. . needs to be seen in the context of the power invested in the position'.9

These issues have particular relevance for any discussion of women's work. Feminist
writers have noted the 'gender bias' of definitions of skill.10 Men are able to claim their
work as skilled while women are not. It is indisputable that historically women have
been largely confined to low-paid, low-status, so-called unskilled work. What is less
clear is how far this work is technically less skilled than men's or how far it is merely
defined as less skilled because women perform it. Discussions of feminisation accom¬
panying deskilling become confused and misleading unless this issue is resolved, as do
more general attempts to explain the historical development of the sexual division
of labour.

To resolve this difficulty it is necessary to arrive at some objective definition of skill,
apart from its social construction. Attempts to formulate objective evaluations of work as
skilled have stressed the importance of task range and worker discretion as key criteria.
Thus, a skilled worker has a knowledge of materials, tools and methods, and applies
these as appropriate to a variety of jobs.11 Such knowledge and judgement require a con¬
siderable period of training and it is this training period which gives skilled workers their
main weapon in collective bargaining. By restricting entry to training they can secure a
monopoly of knowledge and judgement. Any campaign by employers to break this mon¬
opoly has to be of a very protracted kind, lasting at least as long as it takes to educate
new workers.

While I would agree with much of this argument, I think it underestimates the import¬
ance of manual dexterity in the whole process. Skills take time to acquire in the manufac¬
turing context because they involve practice as well as education. Thus, a compositor
needs time to learn about principles of balance and spacing, different typefaces,
divisions of words, spelling and grammar, and so on, but time is also needed in order to
become adept at picking type and setting it quickly.12

This dimension of technical skill is important since it explains in part why women's
skills are devalued in the market place. Manual dexterity, although often considered a
'natural' female attribute, in reality is acquired by large numbers of women in the course
of their training at home and school. Thus, as Chilla Bulbeck has observed, if a skill 'is
widely held in the workforce, it is less likely to command high status and rewards,
because it confers less bargaining power on those who have that skill'.13 The fact that
manual dexterity is not generally considered an integral part of skill reflects the common
equation of skilled work with men's work. Their skills are acquired through formal
on-the-job training.

For my purposes, then, an objective definition of skilled work in the manufacturing
context refers to work which involves a variety of tasks, an element of judgement and a
degree of special dexterity (speed, accuracy and particular technique). Work is more or
less skilled to the extent that it embodies these features in greater or lesser degree-.14

A second area of debate concerns Braverman's treatment of Taylorism and scientific
management. Tony Eiger's critique draws our attention to Braverman's failure to explain
the timing of the adoption of scientific management. Such dramatic changes were, he
argues, precipitated by 'crises of valorisation', or serious difficulties (from the capitalist's


-----

point of view) in extracting surplus value from production. Or, as Eric Hobsbawm
explains: 'It was safer if less efficient to stick to the old ways, unless pressure of profit
margins, increased competition, the demands of labour or other inescapable facts forced
a change.'15 It was the depression of the late nineteenth century, combined with growing
working-class demands, which precipitated the movement to intensify labour in the
United States of America.

Others challenge Braverman's assertion that Taylorism expressed the management logic
of monopoly capitalism. Subsequent writers emphasise other strategies employed by man¬
agement to minimise the opportunities for collective worker opposition. Friedman, for
instance, points to the adoption of 'responsible autonomy' by managements anxious to
overcome the contradictions produced by scientific management's tendency to monopolise
conception. This attempted monopoly, argues Friedman, produces an inevitable worker
resistance. In order to cope with this new form of insubordination, managements were
forced to adopt alternative strategies, namely 'the maintenance of managerial authority by
getting workers to identify with the competitive aims of the enterprise so that they will act
"responsibly" with a minimum of supervision'.16

Bryan Palmer argues that Braverman's account of Taylorism emphasises its direct con¬
trol features to the neglect of its more subtle, ideological aspects. Taylorism, he suggests,
along with the 'efficiency movement' in general, undermined the populist conception of
the worker as creative agent and transformed him/her to a passive factor of production.
At the same time, welfarism and 'personnel' initiatives developed alongside Taylorism to
strengthen and sustain capitalist hegemony beyond and within production.17 Littler like¬
wise emphasises the changing nature of Taylorism as it became allied with industrial
psycho-physiology (industrial psychology and fatigue studies) in the years between the
two world wars.18 As an extension to these arguments, Beechey draws attention to the
importance of the state in affecting the labour process. She criticises Braverman for fail¬
ing to distinguish between the strategies of individual capitalists in organising the labour
process and the strategy of capital in general, 'represented in state apparatuses which are
involved in organising the general conditions of production and accumulation and in
regulating the supply and conditions of labour'.19

This point is particularly pertinent in the Australian context where state wage-fixing
bodies played a key role in constructing and reinforcing definitions of work. Australian
feminists have begun an examination of the role both of state wages boards and of fed¬
eral arbitration in defining the sexual division of labour.20 Peter Cochrane has looked
more particularly at the role of arbitration in affecting workers' responses to technologi¬
cal change. He argues that the arbitration system also militated against any ideas about
workers' power'. The industrial courts were, he points out, empowered to deal only with
'economist' issues (wages and working conditions) and had no mandate beyond this to
interfere with the rights of capital to run business in its own way.21 But while the scope
for the arbitration system to be used as an arena of struggle over the labour process was
thus limited, arbitrators still had considerable influence. In fact, argues Cochrane,
between the wars, 'progressive' arbitrators pressed Taylorist ideas on 'sluggish manufac¬
turers', contributing to the 'important part' played by the state in popularising scientific
management amongst Australian employers.


-----

Richard Edwards acknowledges the range of strategies employed by capital in the
period coinciding with the emergence of monopoly capitalism. He argues, however, that
all these attempts failed. There was, he maintains, a shift to structural forms of control
through bureaucratic and technical means. Most importantly, dual labour markets were
created in a strategy to 'divide and conquer' worker opposition.22 As this idea is
expressed in the later work by Edwards, Gordon and Reich, large firms 'aimed to divide
the labour force into various segments so that the actual experiences of workers would be
different and the basis of their common opposition would be undermined'.23

The work of Hagan and Fisher on Australian coalminers and compositors suggests a
variation of this 'divide and conquer' theme. They argue that different methods of pay¬
ment encourage different levels of class consciousness. In the case of coalmining and
printing, 'piecework acted to diminish the chance of the union members developing a
loyalty to a large entity like the working class'.24

Different methods of payment clearly do have different effects on workers' attitudes to
each other and to their employers. However, it is important to note that it is not possible
to deduce these effects in any direct way. For instance, in some circumstances workers
can combine in defence of the independence associated with piecework. (Indeed, the
evidence from Hagan and Fisher also supports this contradictory aspect of the system.)
Similarly, persistent cutting of piece rates can engender an enhanced sense of collective
exploitation amongst workers. Nor is it necessary for workers to be paid by the piece for
them to recognise a degree of self-interest in the prosperity of the industry which
employs them.25

When discussing methods of payment it is important to bear in mind Hobsbawm's
warning about the dangers of generalisation, 'especially in view of the incredible com¬
plexity of the industrial scene'.26 The ramifications of any particular method depend very
much on the circumstances and conditions under which it is implemented. There are
many factors, such as quality control; regularity of work; the need for careful use of
machines and materials; ease of accounting; the necessity of supervision; flexibility in
working hours; the existence of outwork; the need for apprenticeship training; the impo¬
sition of tasks for time work, and how these are decided; methods of determining levels
of piece rates; whether pieceworkers are paid for waiting time and compensated for
other difficulties in the physical working environment; the sex of the workers; and the
effects of government regulations. All these can affect whether or not a particular scheme
is advantageous to either employees or management. With these qualifications in mind, it
is nonetheless true that methods of payment do have the potential to enforce greater
intensity, or speed-up, in the workplace and can thus be seen as a method of control over
labour.27 And they also have the potential in some circumstances to deflect worker oppo¬
sition to management into competition with other workers.28

Michael Burawoy also investigates the ways in which potential worker opposition to
management is deflected into conflict or rivalry between workers. He shows how workers'
methods of adaptation to work can produce acquiescence in the capitalist system itself. He
points in particular to 'games' constructed by workers, such as speed competitions, which
legitimise the labour process. As Burawoy says, 'one cannot play a game and question the
rules at the same time; consent to rules becomes consent to capitalist production'.29


-----

Several British writers have investigated other ways in which workers' techniques for
adapting to industrial work can serve the interests of management. Paul Willis has
shown how definitions of masculinity which emphasise performance of 'tough' work
help to reconcile male workers to heavy, dirty, noisy, boring factory jobs.30 Anna Pollert's
study of tobacco workers shows how feminine cultures also serve the interests of capital.
The world of romance, brides and babies imported into the factory with female workers
helps them cope with the rigid format, supervision and general tedium of modern fac¬
tory work. At another level, firms draw on family ideology and patterns of hierarchy in
an attempt to bolster the authority of employers over employees with the patriarchal
authority of men over women and older workers over younger workers. Thus, 'class con¬
trol was mediated by patriarchal control'.31

What all these writers share is an emphasis on the inadequacy of Taylorism alone as a
method of securing control of labour. This relates to a third area of criticism of Braver-
man: his failure to allow for the strength of workers' resistance in the shaping of the
labour process. Numerous writers have shown how important such resistance was, as
was the opposition of overseers and middle-level managers.32

While workers' resistance was often important, it is wrong to assume that the work¬
force will always be oppositional. To assume that conflict is always the major character¬
istic of the relationship between labour and capital is misleading. This relationship is
ambivalent and interdependent. There is potential for co-operation and compromise as
well as conflict. What is of interest to historians is the particular set of historical circum¬
stances which affect the balance between these tendencies at any given time.

One can apply the same argument to the critique of participants in the labour process
debate who argue for the primacy of either control or exploitation as the source of con¬
flict between workers and management over the labour process.33 For example, at one
extreme are writers such as Storey who argue for 'control' and 'resistance' as the dialectic
in the development of the labour process. Thus,

... a key structural element of management is control. But because perceived interests are thereby
potentially threatened, workers do in varying degrees resist this control both individually and collec¬
tively, passively and actively. This dynamic of contestation constitutes the basis for a dialectical inter¬
play between control and resistance.34

At the other extreme is Sheila Cohen's assertion that workers' struggles within the labour
process 'are not about "control" but about exploitation; not about "bossing" but about the
relationship between effort and reward, labour intensification and work measurement'.35

I would suggest that it is not theoretically necessary to choose between control and
exploitation in this way. From the workers' point of view, some struggles are about con¬
trol, particularly those which involve craft workers conscious of their traditions and
status as artisans. One could also hypothesise that 'bossing' itself would become an issue
where workers felt they were being exposed to unreasonable or offensive authority. The
case of female workers subject to the closer scrutiny of male overseers is one obvious
situation where conflict would be about bossing rather than exploitation of labour. On
the other hand, exploitation would appear to be the most likely cause of friction when
changes in production methods clearly resulted in workers having to work harder for


-----

fewer rewards. This would seem to be more applicable to semi-skilled workers where
subdivision and mechanisation are more obviously aimed at intensifying labour rather
than undermining control. And, in a sense, the distinction between control and exploi¬
tation is a false one: loss of control usually implies greater exploitation. It is generally
impossible to struggle against one without struggling against the other.

The issues from management's point of view are likewise not amenable to such reduc-
tionism as the dichotomy between control and exploitation implies. The capitalist
imperative to extract increasing levels of surplus value is clearly the major reason why
capitalists seek innovations in the work process. But the motive to effect changes as well
as the ability to carry out such plans is often closely related to the question of control in
the workplace. For instance, capitalists may introduce machinery and subdivided work
processes as a strategy to undermine or co-opt the power of skilled workers who are
resisting employer efforts to reduce their wages. For such employers, securing additional
control over the labour process is essential to increasing the rate of valorisation. The
issues of exploitation and control are thus often inseparable for employers, as they are
for workers.

The final relevant area of criticism of Braverman's thesis is that provided by feminists.
We have already noted the connections made between patriarchy and capitalism in the
context of the 'control' debate. We have also seen how feminists, along with others, have
questioned definitions of skill which do not allow for its 'social construction'. This is
related to the question of Teminisation' of occupations which had been predominantly
male. Thus, any discussion of women entering 'male' jobs which have been deskilled
must be sensitive to the possibility that such jobs are not so much technically deskilled
as, rather, redefined as unskilled because women do them.36 Or, as Beechey puts it, when
discussing feminisation, 'it is important to investigate the extent to which it is the same
occupation which is being "feminised", or whether the process of deskilling results in the
creation of a new occupation or function within the collective labour process'.37

I would also add that it is important to determine the extent to which women are enter¬
ing existing jobs previously performed by men, or whether they are performing new
work created by changing technologies and market requirements. Thus, women entered
the Australian meat-processing industry in large numbers in the 1950s and 1960s via
packaging departments. This was new work created by the growing demand for boned
meat packed in cartons for the US market rather than the export of whole carcasses.38

Feminists have also drawn attention to the importance of the inter-relationship
between the position of women as wage-labourers and as domestic labourers within the
family in affecting changes in the labour process. Thus, state policies, male trade union
exclusivism and ideological assumptions about women's place affect the sexual division
of work in ways which cannot be understood by reference to Braverman's models of
family transformation under capitalism.39 Braverman posits the destruction of the social
and productive roles of the family under capitalism, leaving only an expanded role'as a
unit of consumption.40

One can question whether the family under capitalism has been stripped of its social
functions. And while, in general, the trend from production to consumption is true, it
overlooks the continuing role of the family in the daily reproduction of labour power and


-----

the biological reproduction of the species. This oversight underestimates the continuing
amount of domestic labour performed in the home, in addition to the 'labour of con¬
sumption'. And as this labour falls mainly on women, their role in the paid workforce is
inevitably affected.41

The importance of this qualification is that it helps explain why it is women who
occupy the lower-paid, lower-status jobs in the workforce. As Curthoys expresses it:

the sexual division in the labour market ... is neither a simple reflection of earlier pre-industrial,
household divisions, nor something independently generated within the workplace or the labour mar¬
ket. Rather, it arises from an interaction between bio-cultural tradition and practices, on the one
hand, and the specific institutions of individual capitalist production on the other. [It] is the product
of a fundamental contradiction between the continuation of a family household structure and capital¬
ist relations of production.42

Thus, the biological and cultural association of women with childbirth and child-care
placed them at a disadvantage in the labour market. Their lower participation rates
meant they were in a weaker position to bargain for high wages and the recognition of
skills than were male workers. Their lower wage rates in turn provoked exclusionary tac¬
tics from male workers (supported by some women) in defence of higher male wage rates
which were often used to support women as unpaid labourers in the home. These tactics
were reinforced by the state through protective legislation and the decisions of wage¬
fixing tribunals, as well as through educational services which channelled workers into
different occupations according to sex. The sexual segmentation of the paid workforce
then reinforced the sexual division of labour in the home as women, restricted to low-
paid work, were unable to challenge men's position as family 'breadwinners'.

Analyses by other writers offer variations on this theme, with the major disagreement
being over the extent to which male worker exclusivism was a defence of male patriar¬
chal privilege or of the 'working-class family'.43 This is an issue which can be illuminated
by historical research, bearing in mind that there was always more than one version of
'the family' in the working class. Households headed by women were not unusual. One
must ask whether they were also defended by such strategies.

Work such as that by Cynthia Cockburn also indicates that the stakes were more than
monetary. The erosion of job segregation by sex was a challenge to men's sense of mas¬
culinity as well as to their capacity to earn high wages.44

The emphasis on the connections between family and paid work also feeds into analy¬
ses of the 'reserve army of labour'. Originally posited by Marx as a category undifferen¬
tiated by sex, the idea was taken up by Braverman. He argued that women formed part
of the 'floating and stagnant' sectors of an industrial labour reserve, drawn into the
workforce by the inadequacies of the male wage. They formed a pool of labour which
could be drawn on in times of economic expansion and repelled in times of recession.45

Feminists, however, have criticised this analysis as being sex-blind in the same way
that Marx's was.46 Braverman's concept fails to take account of the sex-segregation of the
labour market which prevents women's labour from being interchangeable with men's
except in extreme circumstances (for instance, in wartime). Some would therefore argue
for its rejection altogether as a useful category of analysis.471 would argue, however, that


-----

the concept is a useful one, but that it is more appropriate to conceptualise women as a
pool of potential wage-earners who can be provided for the labour market under certain
circumstances. This concept emphasises changing factors in the supply of female labour
rather than fluctuations in demand alone. Combined with a notion of household econ¬
omic strategies, it can explain shifting levels of female workforce participation in terms
of shifting requirements for the labour of women (both married and unmarried, mothers
or not) as unpaid labourers in the home.48 Thus, patterns of fertility, shifts in household
production and domestic technology, and fluctuating male incomes determine whether a
woman's labour is of more value to the household unit in the home or in the workforce.
And the decision for women to enter paid work outside the home is mediated by the
strength of ideological prescriptions about 'woman's place'.

A focus on the labour process can illuminate these processes. It can also provide a new
angle of vision on other aspects of social history: on the changing role and status of
women within industry and society as a whole; on definitions of masculinity and femi¬
ninity; on the role of the state in constructing and reinforcing sexual divisions both in the
home and in the paid workforce; on the quest for social justice for workers, both male
and female; on the relationship between radical ideologies (such as anarchism, socialism,
communism, syndicalism and feminism) and the workplace.

This study focuses on the years between 1880 and the outbreak of World War II. This
period coincides with the rise of Victoria's manufacturing industry as an important part
of both the Victorian and Australian economies. Victoria led the way in the establishment
of manufacturing industries in the period between 1860 and 1890. Even when New
South Wales overtook it in terms of total manufacturing output in the 1890s, Victoria
continued to be the leading employer of female labour and the most important centre for
the production of clothing and footwear. The time-span covers periods of expansion,
depression and war. It was in this period that industrial capitalism was both established
and tested. Over the same time, workers became organised and governments entered the
industrial arena in an unprecedented way, not only fixing tariffs but also regulating the
price and conditions of labour and, in some cases, directly engaging in manufacturing.
And, while paid work was being transformed under these influences, domestic labour
was changing. As the birth rate fell, domestic production increasingly moved into the fac¬
tory. In short, these were formative years in the development of Australian urban society
and culture. The time-span thus offers a broad field of view in which to observe the
historical unfolding of patterns of change.

The industries selected as case studies also offer a range of types and experiences. First
there is the clothing industry, with its overwhelming female workforce (over 85 per cent),
labour intensity, multiplicity of productive units, and an extremely varied and highly
protected product market. In sharp contrast is the printing industry, traditionally a male
industry but increasingly employing females (one-third were women by the 1930s),
increasingly capital-intensive, a smaller number of firms, a relatively homogeneous
product market and little import competition. The boot and shoe industry falls some¬
where between the two: a recognisably male trade but one which employed a significant
number of women (between one-quarter and one-half of workers); and a combination of


-----

both extensive capital investment and labour intensity. It shared the clothing industry's
features of numerous product units and a varied and highly competitive product market,
although—with the exception of the level of competition—these features were not as
marked as in clothing manufacture.

The nature of work in each of these industries also varied. This variety offers, I believe,
ample scope to test my contention that the structure of work arose out of the interplay
between product and labour markets, capital supply, technology, racial and gender
orders and the activities of the state.

The book is divided into three broad sections according to the level of state involve¬
ment in wage-fixing. Thus, the first section covers the period of unregulated wages
before the establishment of the wages board system in the wake of the 1896 Shops and
Factories Act. The second section covers the years during which the industries operated
exclusively under these state wages boards. The third section embraces the period of fed¬
eral wage-fixing under the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.
Within these broad sections, the industries are examined separately. The exact time-span
covered by each chapter varies slightly, depending on when each board was formed and
when the first case was brought before the Arbitration Court.

Sources for this study are varied, allowing a focus on work from many perspectives:
that of the employer, the union official, the factory inspector, the consumer, the Arbi¬
tration Court judge and, not least importantly, the worker. This variety allows consider¬
ation of the importance of human agency whilst giving due recognition to real structural
restraints. To paraphrase Marx, we can see people making their own history and also the
conditions which constrain them.

The stirring tale of Melbourne's rise to wealth and glory in the wake of the 1850s gold-
rushes, and its subsequent decline in the depression of the 1890s, has been told and
retold.1 The three industries examined here rose and fell with the general economic tide,
so a brief account of the context is necessary to situate the detailed discussion of individ¬
ual industries which follows.

The goldrush immigrants brought with them more than their optimism to Victoria:
they also provided the basis for a thriving industrial colony. As consumers, workers,
entrepreneurs and financiers, the new population contributed immeasurably to the
growth of Victoria's urban centres in the 1860s and 1870s. In the 1880s their children
continued the process of urbanisation. With urbanisation came manufacturing to satisfy
the demands of the towns for food, clothing and shelter. The development of farming
areas in the Wimmera, North-East and Riverina in the 1870s provided additional mar¬
kets for the produce of the factories, and improved communications, especially by rail,
ensured the speedy transport of goods to these markets.2

Victorian manufacturing in the 1860s and 1870s was thus based on a building boom
and import-replacement industries such as engineering, food processing and clothing.
The infant industries were nurtured initially by protective tariffs, and the economy as a
whole benefited from the injection of government expenditure on public works.3

Despite the overall expansionary trend in these decades, it would be misleading
to paint the period from 1860-90 as one of sustained and uniform growth. The econ¬
omy as a whole grew more slowly, for instance, in the first half of the 1860s and
second half of the 1870s than it did in the periods of rapid growth, 1871-74 and
1880-83.4 Individual industries also experienced periods of fluctuating growth which
did not always correspond to general trends. Employment and production in the
metal and printing trades, for instance, rose steadily in the late 1870s, whereas in foot¬
wear they increased sharply between 1874 and 1881 and in clothing at a slightly later
period (1880-82).5

The golden age of 'Marvellous Melbourne' in the 1880s was a similarly complex
decade economically. While the economy as a whole was buoyed by the spin-offs from
the building boom and high wool prices, many consumer industries stagnated. These
import-replacement industries had, by the middle of the 1880s, saturated the local mar¬
ket. The tariffs which had protected them from competition in the early years now acted
as a barrier to the expansion of markets into neighbouring colonies, as some of these col¬
onies retaliated. Victorian manufacturers also lost ground in southern New South Wales
where reduced rail charges benefited their Sydney competitors. The competition from
overseas imports also became more intense, as lower ocean freights reduced the price of
these goods on the Melbourne market. Rising labour costs in these labour-intensive
industries also took their toll, but the cruellest irony of all was the effect of protective
tariffs which raised the cost of imported producers' materials. This was particularly felt
in the clothing and footwear industries which depended to a large extent on imported
woollen cloth and leather.6

The collapse of the land boom in 1888 was the first in a series of crises which culmi¬
nated in the severe depression of 1892-95. The maritime strike followed in 1890 and,
even more disastrously, foreign investment dried up and export prices plunged from


-----

early 1891. This turned recession into depression. The series of bank failures in 1892-93
acted like shifting ballast on an already sinking ship.

Manufacturing industries were caught up in the general economic crisis, although
some were harder hit than others. As Davison has aptly expressed it, 'the higher they
rose the further they fell'.7 Those industries which had stagnated in the late 1880s, like
clothing, boots and food, were less dramatically hit than the construction, consumer-
durable and related industries (including printing).8 In fact, those industries which com¬
peted with imports made relative gains in the 1890s as consumers bought more of the
cheaper local product in preference to expensive imports. Local manufacturers were able
to keep their costs to a minimum because of the general fall in wage rates. These indus¬
tries also benefited from new markets in Western Australia and were among the first to
recover after 1894, along with renewed gold production and new industries such as
dairying, frozen meat, coalmining and wheat farming.9

Within these general fluctuations there were three important changes in manufactur¬
ing in the late nineteenth century: the subdivision of work, mechanisation and femini-
sation. Although Victoria's industrial revolution lagged behind that in Britain and the
USA and never achieved the heights or depths of the northern hemisphere experience,
the changes that occurred between the 1850s and the 1890s were nonetheless dra¬
matic.10 The three-storey clothing factory of the 1880s and 1890s, employing upwards of
200 women on sewing machines, bore little resemblance to the small group of male
tailors and apprentices, helped by the occasional female vest or trouser hand, which rep¬
resented the usual clothing establishment of the 1850s. Mechanisation of spinning and
weaving, brewing and food processing accompanied the capitalist intrusion into formerly
small-scale domestic production. And while printing had long been mechanised to some
extent, the application of steam power to drive presses in the 1870s and 1880s signalled
the erection of the imposing daily newspaper office with its hundreds of workers and
expensive machinery.11

The process of mechanisation and the growth of the factory system was, however, very
uneven. In the shadow of the new mechanised factories, production continued in more
or less traditional ways in under-capitalised workshops and workers' homes. Indeed,
despite the emergence of larger factories in the 1880s, the average size of the production
unit actually declined in labour-intensive industries such as clothing.12 In some ways this
represented the survival of pre-industrial methods alongside modern factory production.
The blacksmith's shop, and the engineering factory, for instance, continued in their dif¬
ferent ways to make many similar products.13 Likewise, a needlewoman working at
home might cut and sew garments from material supplied by a draper, while a large fac¬
tory would make the same items of clothing from materials supplied by a warehouse. In
other cases, however, factory production and small workshop and home production
were more interconnected, with some parts of the manufacturing process being carried
on in a factory and others outside it. Garments and boots, for example, were often made
up in mechanised factories with the hand-finishing being done by outworkers.14 How¬
ever, the association between homework and benchwork was not always clear. Most
notably, in the sewing trades, workers using treadle machines employed technology as
sophisticated as that employed in most large factories at the same time.


-----

Nor was there a clear correlation between mechanisation and either feminisation or
subdivision of work processes. Those areas which experienced the greatest transform¬
ations in technology—ironworking, engineering and brickmaking—did not employ sig¬
nificant numbers of women.15 The dramatic increase in the female manufacturing
workforce in the 1860s and 1870s occurred mainly in the garment industries. Garment
workers constituted about 90 per cent of female manufacturing workers by 1881. (See
Appendix, Table A2.)16 And while it is true that the use of sewing machines on ready¬
made men's clothes hastened the existing trend toward female labour in that branch of
the trade, the overwhelming proportion of female garment workers were involved in the
largely unmechanised dressmaking section which was traditionally a female preserve.

Females as a percentage of total manufacturing workers did not increase in the 1880s.
However, in the 1890s, the percentage of workers in registered factories who were
female increased from 25 in 1890 to 37 per cent in 1900.17 This did not mean, however,
that women were displacing men from traditional male occupations. Most of the increase
can be explained in terms of greater levels of unemployment in male trades connected
with building and rural industry (such as brickmaking, engineering, agricultural
implement making, sawmilling). (See Appendix, Table A1.). The industries of the 1890s
which experienced the most pronounced technological changes (bootmaking and sec¬
tions of printing) showed no significant increase in female employment.18

The association between mechanisation and subdivision of the labour process was
similarly complex. Subdivision of the tailoring trade into the making of individual gar¬
ments predated mechanisation. In bootmaking, however, the division of the old shoe¬
maker's craft into clicking, making and finishing was precipitated by the introduction of
machinery on the making process.19 Subsequent subdivision of both garment and
bootmaking processes occurred both in association with machinery and independently
of it. In the 1880s for instance, as Davison points out, 'most complaints of subdivision of
labour and dilution of skill [in these trades] come not from huge mechanised factories but
small backyard workshops'.20

Whether subdivision was associated with mechanisation or not, it was clearly an
increasing feature of Victorian industry in the 1880s and 1890s. The breakdown of the
apprenticeship system was symptomatic of this trend away from craft production, and
this in turn was accompanied by the increasing employment of unindentured juveniles in
place of trained adult workers.21

The entry of women into the Victorian paid workforce was related more closely to
demographic changes than changes in industrial technology and work processes. The
high population growth of the 1860s was the result both of births and of female immi¬
gration, and it was these women who provided the supply of cheap labour for the devel¬
oping consumer industries.22 In fact, women in nineteenth-century Victoria had few
alternatives: the paid labour market was so rigidly sex-segregated that for most women
the choice was between factory work and domestic service, either in one's own home or
someone else's.23 After 1881, domestic work represented the largest female occupational
grouping, followed by industrial employment. (See Table 1.) And as we have seen of the
industrial occupations, the overwhelming majority of women and girls were engaged in
the production of clothing.


-----

The market for female labour did not, however, remain static over the period from the
1860s to the turn of the century. On the contrary, the kinked age distribution of Victoria's
population as a whole had peculiar effects on the supply of female labour.24 The girls
who worked in the clothing, boot and food factories in the 1870s had, by the 1880s,
reached marriageable age.25 While as couples they contributed to the building boom of
this decade, as wives and mothers their role was rather different. No longer available to
work in factories, many were still prepared to combine paid work in their own homes
with their domestic duties to help the family economy as a whole. Many factories felt the
loss of their most experienced workers very keenly, and were only too willing to give
them work to do at home. For instance, the Chief Inspector of Factories reported in 1889
that there was a shortage of skilled female hands in the boot trade, particularly machin¬
ists and flowerists. He attributed this to the shortage of apprentices, and the fact that
many employees were leaving to get married. The latter had often been 'induced' to do
outwork for the factories: 'Some are making as much as two pounds a week, and
considered it a great compliment to do the work at all.'26 It was these same women, by
this time burdened with young children, who contributed to the growth of outwork in
the 1890s, when reduced family incomes as a whole made their contributions more vital.
In 1893, for example, Edward Bartlett told the Factories Commission that his clothing
factory employed 120 hands inside and 200 hands outside. 'The bulk of the hands work¬
ing out of the factory', he explained, 'are those who were in the factory before, who have
got married or have met with misfortunes.' Others were able to return to factory work.
Another clothing manufacturer gave evidence at the same enquiry about 'four or five
young women' working in his factory, 'doing it for the sake of their husbands and
children'. He explained that 'they have been in tolerably comfortable circumstances after
working for me as young girls for some years'.27

The shortage of apprentices referred to by the Chief Inspector of Factories was also
partly the result of the skewed age distribution, but as a factor in the overall supply of
female labour it needs further explanation. Sinclair has suggested that the participation
of single women in the paid workforce bore an inverse relationship to the general level of
economic prosperity. That is, when male breadwinners' earnings were high, daughters
contributed their labour directly to the household in the form of domestic help rather
than as paid factory workers. By the same token, in times of high male unemployment,

as in the 1890s, it was more important for daughters to contribute financially to the
family economy, whether by factory work or outwork.28

The 1890s saw not only an increasing proportion of single 'girls' in paid work, but also
an increasing percentage of the female population remaining single. Table 2 illustrates the
significant increase in the proportion of unmarried women in all age groups between the
Censuses of 1891 and 1901.

It was thus a combination of these factors—the marriage of the female goldrush child-
cohort, the changing rate of workforce participation among unmarried women, and the
increasing percentage of women remaining unmarried—which together account for the
relatively short supply of female factory labour in the 1880s and the increased partici¬
pation of women in both outwork and factory work during the depression.29 Sinclair
estimates that the proportion of all women engaged in paid work increased from 36.5
per cent in 1891 to 40.7 per cent in 1901.30

The market for male labour was much more varied than that for females, both in terms
of the range of occupations and the range of industries. They were found in significant
numbers in almost all categories of employment. Agricultural and pastoral pursuits still
accounted for the bulk of male labour in the late nineteenth century, although large num¬
bers were also found in mining and building. (See Appendix, Table Al.) In manufactur¬
ing, men were concentrated in the 'heavy' industries, such as machinery, tools, carriages
and metalwork. The exact proportions varied with the fluctuations in each particular
industry, but none of these occupations was ever seriously challenged as adult male
domains at this time. (See Appendix, Tables A4, A5.) As we have seen, this was not the
case in some of the lighter factory work, where the craftsman's status and skill were
being undermined by cheaper juvenile labour employed on subdivided work.31 This was
especially so in those consumer industries which faced a cost-price squeeze in the latter
half of the 1880s and were therefore more than usually anxious to cut labour costs. Some
employers also turned to female labour as more efficient and tractable than the notori¬
ously undisciplined colonial youths.32

The prevalence of outwork in the boot and clothing industries in particular also under¬
mined the position of workers in the trade as a whole, as outworkers were not amenable
to trade union organisation in the same way that factory workers were. The problems
presented by females, juveniles and outworkers compounded the difficulties created by
the seasonal fluctuations in the general labour market. In an economy so dependent on
rural produce and construction, the weather played a crucial role in determining the
availability of work, making worse the situation of those already disadvantaged by skill,

gender and/or ethnicity. The summer peak and winter trough experienced in these
industries produced far-reaching effects within the economy as a whole, from the
transport industry to services and manufacturing. Indeed, recent work suggests that
intermittency and underemployment were so significant in the nineteenth-century econ¬
omy that even the conventional characterisation of the 1880s as the Tong boom' or The
Workingman's Paradise' needs major modification. Wage rates may have been high, but
real earnings were often seriously eroded by the casual and unreliable supply of work.33
Manufacturing was not exempt from these violent fluctuations in demand for labour.
This was partly a response to seasonal variations in the rest of the economy, but was also
the product of factors specific to particular industries. For instance, the changes in the
weather affected the demand for clothing, producing sharp demand for labour in spring
and autumn preparing the new season's stock, and equally dramatic slumps in winter
and summer. Mantle makers, perhaps the worst affected, were idle for three to four
months of the year because of the shortness of the seasons in the context of a limited
colonial market.34 The spring social season leading into Christmas was a busy time
for clothiers, whilst providing additional demand for services, such as printing and
tourist facilities.35

Even before the depression of the 1890s low wages, long hours, poor conditions and
large numbers of juveniles characterised those industries associated with female labour
and led to a series of legislative enactments. The Shops and Factories Act of 1873, the
first of its kind in Australia, was mainly directed at the general physical standard of
working conditions (for instance, ventilation and overcrowding), and at limiting the
hours of female workers. Although in theory women were not permitted to work more
than eight hours per day, in practice the regulation had little effect. Pieceworkers were
exempt from this restriction, as were workers in factories employing fewer than ten
people. As these categories covered the majority of clothing workers, the main targets of
the legislation, the gains for workers were minimal. Furthermore, factory workers could
apply for exemption from the eight-hour limit, and this was granted to the entire textile
industry.36

The 1885 Act attempted to remedy some of these defects, but with limited success. The
size of a factory as covered by the Act was reduced from ten to six employees, but many
employers evaded this provision by reducing the number of inside hands and sending
work out. The employment of juveniles was regulated so that girls under thirteen years
and boys under twelve were forbidden to work in factories; boys under fourteen and girls
under sixteen were not permitted to work at night (between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.); persons
under eighteen were forbidden to work in certain dangerous and noxious trades. The Act
also provided for the registration and inspection of factories to ensure they met certain
stipulated health and safety standards, but when breaches were discovered local boards
of health would not prosecute the offenders. More than one-quarter of Victoria's manu¬
facturers escaped the provisions altogether because the Act did not apply to shires, which
included large towns like Beechworth and Kyneton. Furthermore, all factories in exist¬
ence before March 1886 were exempt from key provisions of the Act. Although
employers were supposed to keep records of all outside workers, there was no provision
for compulsion and employers proved very uncooperative. Probably the only real gains


-----

were in relation to safety, where better standards regarding gas and steam engines and
the fencing of dangerous machinery were achieved.37

Despite amendments to the Act in 1893 which provided for female inspectors, no
major changes were made until the 1896 Act which provided for the setting up of Wages
Boards to regulate certain 'sweated' trades. Until that time, there was no government
intervention in the contentious areas of men's hours, wage rates, limitation of apprentices
and the control of outwork, nor was there any effective remedy to the deficiencies con¬
tained in the 1885 Act. If anything, government surveillance became less effective in the
1890s, with an increasing amount of work being done outside registered factories, and a
reduction in the staff in the Chief Inspector's Office in 1892.38

It would be easy, however, to overstate the failure of this early legislation. Although it
certainly achieved few of the tangible benefits intended, the fact that the workplace was
recognised as an appropriate arena for state activity was in itself significant. The creation
of a separate office to administer this legislation in 1886 provided a core of experienced
and dedicated public servants who monitored the industrial situation and played an
important part in the creation of more far-reaching legislation in the 1890s.

Clearly, however, factory legislation played a small role in determining developments
in the labour process. More important was the general level and nature of economic
activity and the peculiarities of the Victorian labour market. The labour market in turn
was the product of both demographic features and a gender order which assigned
women the primary role in child-care. The effect of these factors on the nature of work is
illustrated in the case studies of individual industries.

 The Advent of Machines AND WOMEN: The Clothing Industries, 1880-1896

The three most important structural factors affecting the nature of work in the clothing
trades were the limitations of the colonial market, the suitability of clothing manufacture
for home production and the sex of the workers—or, to be more precise, the sex of the
workers in the context of the prevailing gender order. As the ensuing discussion will show,
these factors were closely intertwined. The gender order affected the general price of
female labour, which was further lowered by outwork. The cost of labour affected the
extent of the market for any particular product. The market demand for cheap products in
turn put a downward pressure on wages, and the gender order limited the ability of female
workers to resist the pressure. It was the combination of labour costs and length of pro¬
duction runs which structured employers' choices about methods of manufacture.

The gender order affected the price of female labour in the clothing industry in three
ways. Firstly, the sexual division of labour in the home, whereby men were regarded as
breadwinners and women as dependent housekeepers and child-rearers, justified lower
wages being paid to women. They were not usually dependent on their earnings for their
own support or that of others. As one employer explained, 'a boy could not earn his salt
at trousers and vests', because the piece rates were women's rates.1 The assumption was
clearly that women's 'salt' cost them less. This assumption was true of enough women to
lower the wages of all, so that even when women did the same work as men, as in some
tailoring firms, they were paid less.2

The sexual division of labour in the home lowered female wages in another way.
Women's primary responsibility for child-care (and the care of the sick and elderly) made
many of them unable to leave home for extended periods of work in factories. Those who
needed to earn money to contribute to the upkeep of their families found outwork an
attractive option. Home labour was usually cheaper labour because of the ease with


-----

which employers could cut rates without fear of collective resistance from individuals
isolated from each other in their own homes. As Duncan Blythell concluded about out¬
work in nineteenth-century Britain, 'so long as there are women who find it hard to
make ends meet as they strive to run their homes, there exists a cheap and docile labour
force for anyone who wishes to use it'.3

The cheapness of outside labour inevitably lowered the wages of factory workers or
reduced the amount of work available.4 Gender also affected the wage earnings of inside
workers in a more direct way by curtailing unionisation and militancy. Ray Markey
points out that female labour faced all the problems of organisation common to
'unskilled' workers. 'Without the strategic monopoly of skills which the craft unions pos¬
sessed', he argues, 'unskilled labour could be easily replaced during disputes with
employers.'5 In a sense he is correct, although I would argue that it was the fact that the
skill of sewing was general in the female population which made workers easily replace¬
able, rather than that the work was technically unskilled. As the report of the official
enquiry into shops and factories found in 1893, even the lowest-paid work in the cloth¬
ing trade involved a degree of skill: 'To call them "unskilled" is not quite correct, for the
work of "finishing" often requires the possession of expertness and ability on the part of
the operative which can only be acquired after long practice.'6 However, because the
sexual division of labour assigned women the domestic task of sewing, large numbers of
the female population did have the Tong practice' which made them experts.

Other aspects of women's roles within the family impinged on their position in the
paid workforce.7 All three sections of the clothing industry (tailoring; dressmaking and
millinery; shirts, underwear and whitework) contained large numbers of young, single
women. Figure 1 shows relative numbers in each section. In fact, only in the tailoring
trade did adults (over the age of twenty-one years) outnumber juniors. (See Appendix,
Figure A3.) Such workers, more preoccupied with their futures as wives than as paid
workers, were poor material for a strong union which could fight for higher rates of pay.8
And while even working-class girls were influenced by the expectation of marriage as an
escape from the poor pay and conditions of the factory, the presence of many girls from
more well-to-do families in the millinery and dressmaking sections further depressed
wages. As a factory inspector, Margaret Cuthbertson, pointed out, 'there are so many
girls who take it up, not with the idea of earning a living, but because they do not like
housework'.9 Such girls would 'rather work for nothing than stay at home'.10 While it is
true that the skills these girls acquired no doubt contributed to the family budget
(whether by the small amount they earnt or by the amount they saved through making
their own dresses), the fact was that they did not depend on their earnings. As Harrison
Ord, the Chief Inspector of Factories, observed: 'While it is very difficult to object to
young girls learning to make their own dresses, it is very hard on those who have to earn
a living in the trade to see the wages lowered by their better-off sisters.'11

This was less of a factor in tailoring, where girls do seem to have been interested in
acquiring marketable skills. The daughter of Hinrich and Catherine Meyer, for example,
was apprenticed to tailoring because her parents believed the possession of a trade was
the best protection against poverty for men and women alike. Their attitude is probably
representative of other nineteenth-century working-class parents.12

Nevertheless, the initial stopgap nature of employment for most girls resulted in high
labour turnover which in itself presented a practical problem for a union trying to keep
track of its membership and deterred workers from paying their dues in advance.13 Fur¬
thermore, the 'genteel', feminine image of dressmaking and millinery workrooms
attracted a disproportionate number of girls and women with 'respectable' aspirations.14
Such workers were unlikely to see unionism as a 'ladylike' pursuit.15 Often socialised
into a passive, retiring femininity, these young women were reputedly unwilling to assert
their rights in the workplace, or to appear in court as witnesses for breaches of the Fac¬
tories Act.16 Speaking of women, especially young women, employed in the sewing
trades, Cuthbertson maintained that 'those people had no idea of looking after them¬
selves. Men are always better able to look after themselves.'17

Older women workers, for whom personal misfortune had exposed the realities of this
feminine model, were potentially more militant in regard to wages and conditions.
Barbara Taylor has observed of 'mothers of families' in eighteenth- and nineteenth-
century Britain, 'Far from being a conservatizing influence, here the responsibilities of
motherhood drew women out of their homes to act and speak in ways shocking to
upper-class observers, used to associating mothering with passivity and domestic con¬
finement.'18 The activities of women such as Mrs Ellen Cresswell, Mrs Warsaw, Mrs Jane
McLeod, Mrs Helen Robertson and Mrs Bryant on behalf of the Tailoresses' Union sup¬
port this conclusion for colonial mothers as well. Married women were certainly dispro¬
portionately prominent during a crisis such as the strike of 1882-83.19 The same factors
which made them militant, however, also made them more vulnerable and desperate and
limited their regular union activity. Women with dependents, working a double shift of
paid and unpaid labour, had little time, opportunity or energy to spare for unionism.


-----

Mature women without dependents, who were to form the backbone of twentieth-
century women's unionism, were less common in the nineteenth-century workforce, and
understandably daunted by the task which faced them,20 This clearly contradicts the con¬
clusions reached by Johanna Brenner and Maria Ramas who argue that 'where young
single women made up the majority of the workforce, the chances of organised struggle
were improved'. The case of the various sections of the clothing trades suggests that the
reverse was true.21

These three factors—the fact that women were not usually breadwinners; the preva¬
lence of outwork; and the low level of worker organisation—arise from the colonial
gender order. Each contributed to the cheapness of female labour, which in turn was the
major determinant of the labour processes adopted in the various branches of the cloth¬
ing industry.

As only the very cheapest house frocks and sunhats were made ready-to-wear,
most dressmaking and millinery was done for individual customers in small work¬
rooms conducted by women proprietors, who did their own cutting and fitting. (The
1881 Census recorded only one man engaged in this branch of the clothing industry,
compared to 11,517 women.22) Although a few individual workers were paid
exceptionally high rates, in the late 1870s and early 1880s most experienced
workers earned between 15 and 25 shillings weekly, and up to 30 and 40 shillings
in the busy periods.23 Treadle machines were used, but much fine handwork was a
feature of the best work. Dressmakers and milliners thus depended on a supply
of cheap labour: in dressmaking this was employed finishing (sewing on buttons, etc.)
the garments made by experienced dressmakers; in millinery the milliner's assistant
prepared the basic work and she did the 'artistic' last stage.24 Most of this labour was
provided by juniors, who usually worked for at least six months without payment
of any kind, and in some establishments they were required to pay premiums of up
to £20 whilst 'learning'.25

The shirts, underclothing and whitework branches of clothing manufacture were like¬
wise labour-intensive. The more elaborate end of the trade which produced the stiff-
fronted white dress-shirts and collars was catered for by large factories like the new
Braeside Shirt Factory in Richmond, but most of the colony's shirts were made by an
army of female outworkers from cut pieces of cloth supplied by contractor, draper or
warehouse.26 The sewing involved in these shirts was relatively straightforward, as was
the making of basic underwear, pillowcases, tablecloths, and so on. The treadle sewing
machine was, in most cases, the only mechanical aid to manufacture.

In such a labour-intensive industry, the size of the wages bill was an important element
in the level of profits. In order to remain competitive in a contracting market, such as that
of the later 1880s and 1890s, employers of female labour found further mechanisation
an unviable method of cutting costs for most employers. Thus, 'many machines which
were profitable to use when they displace labour at a shilling an hour were hardly worth
investing in when hand labour cost but sixpence'.27 It was more economical, and cer¬
tainly much easier, to cut the rates paid to workers. And as we have seen, the existence of
outwork and the low level of unionisation made this a simple proposition in the econ¬
omic climate of the 1880s and 1890s.


-----

In the tailoring section, however, the effect was slightly different. This was a tradition¬
ally male occupation: female labour had become a significant part of the workforce only
from the 1820s, when women were employed in England in the ready-made section of
the trade, initially to make vests. As cloth merchants diversified into the production and
sale of these 'slop' garments, they contracted much of the actual sewing to tailors who
did the work in their own homes. The competition amongst these outworkers led them
to look for cheaper labour, so women were employed to perform some of the simpler
kinds of making, particularly trousers and vests. Initially, male tailors were helped by
their wives and daughters but, as their orders increased, they also employed other
women in the neighbourhood.28 The subdivision of work in the making of a suit of
clothes into its three individual garments (trousers, vest and coat) was part of the process
of using cheaper, less skilled workers: a worker could learn to make one of the garments
adequately much more quickly than the whole three. And while the cheapness of female
labour encouraged the subdivision of suit-making into individual garments, it also
encouraged the subdivision of the tailor's craft into its three processes: cutting, pressing
and sewing, with men employed on the first two and increasing numbers of women
doing the sewing. This represented a classic application of Charles Babbage's principle of
dividing labour into its various parts and thus cheapening labour on the separate sec¬
tions. As Babbage put it: 'the manufacturer, by dividing the work to be executed into dif¬
ferent processes, each requiring different degrees of skill and of force, can purchase
exactly that precise quantity of both which is necessary for each process'.29

The more expensive male labour was mainly employed on the more expensive tasks
(those which required more specialised training) of cutting, pressing and coat-sewing.
Cheaper female labour was employed on the cheaper processes of machining, or sewing
one only of the garments, especially trousers and vests. The cost of labour on all the
divided parts was cheaper because workers became more expert through concentration
on one aspect of the craft. As J. R. Blencowe, manager of Melbourne's largest clothing
factory, explained: 'It is not advisable for a girl to learn coats, trousers and vests, she
cannot get along so quickly. By doing the one they get more expert.'30

And in the case of female labour, the savings were even greater because it was only
half the price of male labour from the outset. Thus, when the clothing industry was
established in Victoria in the wake of the goldrushes, many of the English practices were
transported to Australia. As in England, women had entered tailoring in significant num¬
bers from the middle of the century. By 1881 they comprised about 65 per cent of the
workforce.31 This percentage increased further to reach almost 80 per cent in 1886, and
fluctuated for the rest of the century between 70 and 80 per cent. (See Appendix, Figure
Al.) A Melbourne tailor described the process as similar to that which occurred in Eng¬
land, with home tailors employing their wives. The influx of women to the trade, he
argued, was 'made worse by the introduction of machines'.32 There was still an import¬
ant distinction between the work made to order by tailors for individual customers,-and
the growing trade in ready-made, or slop, articles. The latter were usually made under
contract to the large city warehouses, either by substantial factories or by the small
'backyard' enterprise.33 Drapers and other retailers, such as department stores, were also
involved in manufacturing ready-made clothing, some directly engaging in factory

2 'The advent of machines and women': the ready-made outfit manufacturing room at Messrs
Sargood, Son and Company's factory in Melbourne in 1874 shows the revolution which machines and
female labour brought to tailoring. A handful of male tailors can be seen 'sitting on the board' in the
foreground. These men were still required for the fitting and hand-sewing. They were greatly outnum¬
bered, however, by the female machinists and table-hands. The sketcher has obviously eliminated much
of the clutter which would have been present in this scene.

production whilst others had the work done by contractors.34 And the expansion of the
slop trade coincided with the introduction of treadle sewing machines, almost invariably
operated by women.35

Given the dramatic savings in using women instead of men, the question arises as to
why they were not also employed on cutting, pressing and high-quality order work. The
explanation for this is partly to be found in the nature of these occupations which
allowed male workers (in co-operation with many employers) more control over who
entered them. More specifically, all three tasks were most efficiently performed within a
factory or workroom rather than in the worker's own home, thus enabling organised


-----

resistance by the men against the employment of women. Cutting, for instance, was
more easily done close to the supply of cloth. Carrying pre-cut garment pieces between
warehouse and home was one thing; carting the heavy bolts of cloth was quite another.
Cutters also used long tables to lay out pattern pieces on the cloth before cutting, and
most workers' cottages could not accommodate such a large piece of furniture. The
advantages of factory cutting were even more evident when mass-produced items were
cut in bulk, with up to eighty layers of cloth spread on the table to be cut with a knife or,
more rarely, with a cutting machine.36

Pressing, in the days of flat irons and coke ovens, was also more economically per¬
formed in a central location, with one oven heating the irons for dozens of pressers. This
also minimised the chances of the work being spoiled before reaching its final desti¬
nations. In the case of quality order tailoring, the work required supervision which was
more easily achieved within a factory or workroom.

So long as these processes were kept out of the hands of outworkers, the men had a
reasonable chance of keeping women out of them. These men were helped by the fact
that none of these processes seemed to offer much scope for female labour. Cutting, for
instance, was considered too heavy for women, who were believed to be unable to lift the
bolts of cloth or to cut through as many layers of cloth with a knife. The calculation of
the most efficient layout of the various pieces before cutting required considerable experi¬
ence, another factor which militated against the shorter-term female workers. Pressing,
too, was heavy work, requiring the manipulation of irons weighing up to 32 pounds
(14.5 kg). Pressing was also considered unhealthy work, involving work in steamy con¬
ditions so bad that 'at times you can hardly speak'.37 Like cutting, the pressing of most
garments did not lend itself readily to further subdivision, especially where the garments
were actually sewn together by outworkers before reaching the presser in the factory.
Moreover, it was said to require a long period of training before acceptable levels of com¬
petence in shaping garments could be achieved. This long period of training was also a
major deterrent to employing women on high-class tailoring, and some employers main¬
tained that women could never perform these tasks as well as men, regardless of train¬
ing. John Clark, a representative of the firm of Sargood, Butler, Nicol and Ewen,
maintained that 'a woman could not cut out trousers under any circumstances'.38
Employers also had other reasons for restricting entry to the occupation of cutting, as we
will soon discover.

In the provincial cities of Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo, women were employed more
extensively on such 'male' tasks. The reason for this seems to be that the male workers
abandoned these fields without a fight. William Corbauld, a Ballarat clothier, attributed
the scarcity of men in the town to the reluctance of lads to be apprenticed.39 If this was
indeed the case, it would have been virtually impossible for the male tailors to prevent
females entering the trade. It seems, in fact, that the fate of tailoring in these provincial
centres represents a classic case of 'contagious effeminacy', with males deserting this
occupation for more 'manly' trades.40

In general, then, the availability of cheap female labour encouraged subdivision of tail¬
oring. It also helped popularise alternatives to the traditional made-to-order suit—
garments sold ready-made and the 'slop-order' suit. As we have seen, slop garments


-----

were becoming increasingly popular from the 1820s. The 'slop-order' item, however,
was a product of the 1880s and represented a breakdown in the traditional division
between the ready-made and order sections of the trade. This breakdown was made
possible by the customer's use of self-measurement cards, with the measurements being
passed on by the draper or wholesaler to so-called 'slop-order factories' for making into
suits.41 The order trade was then divided into a higher class, or 'legitimate' trade, carried
on in the traditional way in tailoring shops with mostly male hands, and the cheaper
class of trade carried on in factories with predominantly female labour and more use of
sewing machinery. By 1893, for instance, one of Melbourne's larger order factories
employed ninety women to sew garments and only one man.42 It is unlikely that slop
and slop-order garments would have achieved such an easy acceptance had it not been
for the fact that female labour made their price so much lower than the tailor-made
article.

The questions of cheap labour and further subdivision, however, overlap with the
influence of product markets. The demand for an individual type of clothing limits the
extent to which subdivision is economical. Where demand is limited, production runs of
any particular item are short. To subdivide work to any extent would involve extra calcu¬
lation and handling at the supervisory level and would not produce significant cost
savings in greater speed on the part of workers; by the time the workers had reached a
sufficient level of speed to justify the extra costs of subdivision, the order would have
been complete. However, the division of suit-making into the three garments, each with
three main processes (cutting, pressing, sewing), and the employment of women on
many of these subdivisions, made ready-made garments cheaper. This cheapness
expanded the demand for such clothing, which in turn made further subdivision practi¬
cal. Thus, by the early 1880s three of Melbourne's ready-made tailoring factories were
employing 'the division of labour that is properly understood'—dividing the making of
each garment into two or three divisions.43 By the early 1890s it was standard practice to
sew garments in three stages (machining, tacking and buttonholing) and by the end of
that decade a few manufacturers had taken the process as far as seven.44

Product markets were in general, however, a serious check on the subdivision of
labour. Raphael Samuel makes this point about mid-Victorian industry in general, but
the uncertainty of markets and the variability of production runs were exaggerated in the
colonial context.45 The colonial market for consumer non-perishables such as clothing
was restricted by the size of the colonial population. This meant both short production
runs and short seasons, both of which discouraged economies of scale. James Wyeth, a
mantle manufacturer, was amongst the worst affected. As he explained, 'we lie idle from
three to four months and a half in the year. It is because the seasons are shorter than at
home ... the limited market'.46

Competition from imports exacerbated this trend, as did local methods of retailing.
The Busy Bee factory, for instance, was typical of many workrooms which took cloth
from drapers to be made up into specified quantities of different articles. Such an order
might include 100 pairs of women's knickers in various sizes and fifty bodices in differ¬
ent styles and sizes. Clearly, any degree of subdivision was not viable under such cir¬
cumstances. Fashions in clothing also contributed to limited demand for standard items.


-----

Women's clothing in particular was extremely varied and changeable, with customers
seeking individuality in style and fit even in ready-made garments.

Those factories which did experiment with power-driven machinery and subdivision
of labour were those for whom the generalisations about cheap outside labour and short
production runs were less applicable. Most notably, manufacturers of high-quality stiff-
front dress-shirts, such as the Braeside and Acme factories, could not resort to out¬
workers to cheapen production because the nature of their product required strict quality
control. Moreover, the starching and ironing, which were a large part of the labour
involved, were more economically done inside a factory.

These products were, however, fairly standard items and some of the processes (the
starching and ironing, for instance) were the same regardless of the slight variations in
the style of the shirt. Subdivision enabled these employers to employ less experienced
juvenile labour, in conjunction with 'all the latest machinery and appliances'.47 At the
Braeside factory, one of the largest shirt factories in Victoria, over half of the workers in
1895 were girls employed on wages of two shillings and sixpence per week.48

Manufacturers of higher-quality ready-made and slop-order trousers also used mechan¬
isation and subdivision to a greater extent than other clothing makers. In 1893, Foy and
Gibson's tailoring factory had 185 sewing machines driven by gas engines at the rate of
1700 stitches a minute.49 Longer production runs of standard sizes and styles made use of
cutting machines (such as that used at Beath and Schiess from 1883) more practical. Their
expense was justified when large orders required cutting out up to seventy layers of cloth in
one batch.50 Like the shirt factories, makers of high-class men's clothing could not cheapen
production by giving work out because of the problems this created for quality control.51

Factories such as those operated by Foy and Gibson and Beath and Schiess had an
added advantage in that the vertical integration of manufacturing and retailing or ware¬
housing provided them with more stable contracts and enabled a greater degree of
'rationalisation'. The size of these factories, like those in shirtmaking, also provided
economies of scale in easier access to capital and the use of powered machinery. Henry
Blomfield, a manufacturer in a smaller way, maintained that he wanted to install a gas
engine but he could not out of his own earnings 'erect a gas-engine and plant necessary
for driving all the machines . .. and independently of that the employing of a man at
£2 10s a week [to operate the machine]. It costs me from £2 to £3 a week for expenses
and gas to run this thing.'52

As Jenny Lee and Charles Fahey point out, there was a 'chronic shortage of capital' for
Victorian manufacturing.53 Large companies were more likely to attract what limited
funds were available from outside sources, as well as having greater reserves in the form
of accumulated profits. And the statutory requirement for a qualified engineer to attend
to the gas engine was less of a burden on the wages bill when the engine was driving
hundreds rather than dozens of machines.

The minority of large tailoring and shirt factories which had the means to mechanise
and the economic rationale to do so were, however, constrained in their innovation by
the limitations of available technology. The question of motive power was the most seri¬
ous. Clothing factories were slower than many to use power-driven machinery because
of the difficulty of finding a suitable motive power for the light, high-speed machines.


-----

The usual steam engines were not suitable, so it was not until gas engines became com¬
monly available in the 1880s that some factories used them to drive sewing machines,
and even fewer to drive continuous band-knives. Gas engines, however, did not come
into general use until the late 1890s. The advantages of gas-powered sewing machines to
the manufacturer were limited by the fact that they did not go much faster than treadles
and cost a good deal more to provide than female leg-power, especially given the com¬
pulsory employment of a qualified attendant.54 Finishing machines, introduced for
buttonholing, button-sewing and felling in the 1890s, were also of limited appeal. The
machines 'were not expert enough' for any but the lower-quality slop work—the work
which was done so cheaply by outworkers.55 With such cheap labour available, the extra
investment in this machinery was hardly warranted, particularly as it only reduced the
finishing time for trousers from three hours to two.56

At the other end of the factory scale, small operators were encouraged to stay that way,
or to reduce the size of their workforce, by state regulations. Thus, the 1873 Factories Act
encouraged employers to keep the number of inside hands below ten in order to evade
the provisions of the Act which dealt with hours of work and safety standards. The
reduction in the number of employees to six in 1885 reinforced this trend toward the
proliferation of small workshops.57

Such were the broad conditions which affected individual employers and employees in
their relationship to the labour process. These were not, however, static, immutable struc¬
tures. Collective action by groups of manufacturers and workers could, and did, affect
the particular shape of the structures. In a labour-intensive industry such as clothing
manufacture, the major way in which workers and employees could affect the work pro¬
cess was by collective action which raised the price of labour. Although such collective
action is usually thought of as the province of workers, in some cases employers too have
an interest in restricting entry to key occupations in the trade. Market forces then gener¬
ally ensure that this scarcer labour is paid more. Take the case of the tailor's cutter. Both
employers of cutters and employed cutters had an interest in limiting the total number of
trained cutters in existence. From the employees' point of view, extra cutters represented
competition for jobs. From the employers' viewpoint, they represented potential business
rivals, since cutters were well-placed to become proprietors in their own right. Both
agreed to limit the numbers of males admitted to apprenticeship and to keep girls out of
the occupation altogether.58

The case of first-class milliners was similar. By charging expensive premiums on
apprenticeships, employers restricted the number of expert hands in the business. Only a
limited number of girls would have been able to afford the ten or twenty pounds charged
in Victoria before the Factories Act of 1896 made the practice illegal. This restricted entry
explains the high rates paid to first-class hands.

The corollary of high wages for the small number admitted to the elite of 'experts' was
lower wages to the mass of workers engaged on tasks requiring less training and judge¬
ment. As Inspector Cuthbertson explained, millinery firms 'have one good milliner to
whom they will pay anything from 30 shillings a week up to £2, perhaps £4 ... but then
they have a lot of poorly paid, or low paid, employees working under this milliner
preparing work for her; she does the artistic work herself'.59


-----

In tailoring, a similar dichotomy existed between the salaries of the cutters and the
wages of machinists. However, the general level of machinists' wages was considerably
higher than that of the milliners' assistants. Initially, this difference was due to the fact
that tailoring was a recently subdivided trade. Prior to the 1830s, the cutter was also the
tailor and presser, and the maker of trousers was also the maker of vests. With
subdivision into garments and processes and the employment of women, tailors were no
longer able to restrict entry into the sewing of men's clothing and employers had no
interest in doing so; a worker would not start a workroom of his or her own without
cutting skills, and so long as entry to cutting was still restricted it did not matter to
employers how many entered the sewing workforce—much of which operated from the
workers' homes. The oversupply of female labour, together with the ideology of females
as dependents, depressed wages for the sewing process. However, female wages in tailor¬
ing were, for the average worker, up to 20 per cent higher than those in millinery. This
was partly because females employed in tailoring were initially replacing men. Female
wages were so much lower than men's (about 50 per cent), that considerable savings in
total labour costs occurred without cutting rates to the levels paid in female branches of
the clothing trade. Male unions ensured that their members' rates were kept at an agreed
level.60 However, as competition in tailoring increased, employers did attempt to cut
female rates of pay. But in this case the collective opposition of female factory workers
prevented unrestrained reduction in wages.

Victorian tailoresses had been facing piece-rate reductions throughout the 1870s. Ellen
Cresswell, widowed with three young children in 1860, complained that ever since she
had started as a trouser-hand in Melbourne in 1870 there 'had been an endeavour to
pull prices down'.61 This situation became acute in the late 1870s and early 1880s as
numbers of ex-employees set up as manufacturers. Butlin has estimated that the number
of clothing and textile factories in Victoria increased from 71 to 234 over the period
1871-81.62 The intense competition this caused resulted in a crisis of valorisation,
whereby employers tried to cheapen production in order to attract customers. At first the
tailoresses had tried to defend themselves in each workplace but, as Cresswell found,
such attempts were easily defeated by employers who could get plenty of unorganised
labour to replace the agitators. Cresswell herself had been victimised after a strike
in 1879.63

The situation reached a crisis of exploitation—from the workers' point of view—in
1882. In their quest for ways to cheapen labour, employers were attacking workers' earn¬
ings in new ways. In addition to simple rate-cutting, some manufacturers were having
order work made up in factories at slop rates of pay. Because the order goods had to be
made 'more accurately and slowly' this had the result of 'diminishing their wages by 50
per cent'.64

The tailoresses again went on strike against this renewed form of exploitation. How¬
ever, on this occasion they formed themselves into the Victorian Tailoresses' Union. With
considerable support from the Trades Hall Council, the Age newspaper and the majority
of the large manufacturers, the tailoresses of Beath and Schiess' factories succeeded in
broadening the strike to all the major Melbourne factories. By the end of February most
of the factories had returned to work, having agreed to a compromise log of rates arrived

at in negotiation between the Tailoresses' Union and the newly-formed Clothing
Manufacturers' Association.65

The strike was significant at a number of levels. Its immediate importance was its role
in drawing public attention to the fact that even if Victoria was the 'Workingman's Para¬
dise', it was certainly no paradise for working women. So far as the strike was effective
in this, it was also useful in the campaign to extend the powers of the Shops and Factor¬
ies Royal Commission.66

In the context of Victorian trade union development, the strike was significant in that
it marked the first occasion on which the Trades Hall Committee had acted to finance
and control a strike. The fact that the strikers were women is particularly important here,
although to date historians have neglected the role that gender played. Individual male
trade unions were generally jealous of their own independence, and unwilling to con¬
cede power to a body such as the THC. Women, on the other hand, were accustomed to
the direction of men, and inexperience in industrial matters made them more likely to
accept the help of the men at Trades Hall. In the 1880s, when women had no right to
vote and experienced a range of other legal disabilities, it was unusual for them to par¬
ticipate in public affairs.67 As the Age pointed out: 'Men under similar circumstances can


-----

hold indignation meetings, and publicly make their grievances known; women cannot.
They can only depend upon friends to champion their cause.'68

Without funds of their own it was important that these 'helpless girls', as the Age
called them, secure support from the male union movement and preferably the public at
large. Flouting conventional codes of female behaviour by attempting to organise an
entirely female-run campaign was considered less likely to be successful than 'placing
themselves entirely in the hands of the Trades Hall Committee'.69 They thus provided the
opportunity for the THC to demonstrate its effectiveness at co-ordinating industrial
action by one of its affiliates, and this precedent was soon followed by others and con¬
tributed to a general expansion in the role of the THC in the labour movement.70

Within the tailoring trade, the strike exposed the changing nature of industrial
relations. The growth of the slop trade in the 1870s and, with it, the number of large fac¬
tories, provided the physical preconditions for united worker action. Assembled in num¬
bers of up to 500 workers under one roof, workers became more likely to organise. At
the same time, such large factories created division between employers, giving rise to the
possibility of strategic alliances between workers and groups of manufacturers. The most
obvious divisions occurred between large-scale producers and the small 'backyard' oper¬
ators and order tailors. Albion Walkeley, proprietor of the Phoenix Clothing Company,
commented on the antagonism between the new-style entrepreneurial manufacturers
and the craftsman-turned-working-proprietor; 'Some years ago, when there was a meet¬
ing of the clothing manufacturers called, I attended the meeting; but when I found it was
principally cutters and tailors and that sort of thing, I withdrew from the meeting.'71

In the 1870s, the large clothing manufacturers, John Parry and Frederick Sargood,
joined with trade unionists to agitate for factory legislation.72 In the 1880s, Beath, Schiess
and Company encouraged the formation of a union amongst the tailoresses as a way of
limiting the cut-throat competition between manufacturers for cheaper labour.73 Initially,
they were supported by most of the larger manufacturers, who saw a common interest
between themselves and their workers in preventing the endless price-cutting of their
small competitors.74 This enthusiasm cooled only when the difficulty of drawing up a
uniform log caused problems between these larger manufacturers and their own
workers.

The directions which the industry had taken in the late 1870s and early 1880s pro¬
duced other, more unexpected, alliances, notably that of the so-called 'middlemen' with
the tailoresses. The sixteen major middlemen who took work on contract from ware¬
houses and distributed it to outworkers expressed their desire to join with the tailoresses
in establishing uniform rates of pay.75 Usually cast as the villains in the sweating scen¬
ario, the middlemen drew attention to the need for an organisation of warehousemen to
regulate the prices paid for contract work so as to restrict the price-cutting at its source.
So long as warehouses played one contractor off against another, they argued, the earn¬
ings of both middlemen and their workers would suffer. The middlemen and the union
failed, however, to secure the co-operation of the warehousemen, and the non-union
outworkers proceeded to undercut wages by taking out work below the log rates.76

While the development of a union of tailoresses prompted a more united stand
amongst some employers, as the strike progressed the limits to this co-operation were


-----

also revealed. In the highly competitive atmosphere of the 1880s, manufacturers found it
difficult to trust each other and differences in methods of work also produced divisions.77
The main lines of division in the early 1880s were exposed in the negotiations over the
log. The manufacturers who were also warehousemen (such as Beath and and Schiess
and Banks and Company) were divided from the rest.78 Because they used their factories
to make up garments to order, they were more concerned with the quality of work than
its cheapness, and consequently were prepared to pay up to one-third more in piece rates
than their fellow manufacturers who were restricted to the slop trade. Beath and Schiess
continued to pay the higher price after the Manufacturers' Association had negotiated the
lower rate, because they were paying for a different class of work.79

A further rift appeared between those manufacturers who divided the work into gar¬
ments and those who also subdivided the making of individual garments. The difficulty
in framing a log to meet these different methods of manufacture resulted in the extension
of the strike at the innovative factories for a further two months after the settlement with
the Manufacturers' Association. It is possible that the continuing problem of inflexibility
in the tailoresses' log discouraged manufacturers from experimenting with subdivision
and risking further conflict with the union.

After the major strike was over, the rifts between the manufacturers evident in the
negotiations over the log remained, and caused continuing suspicion within the Manu¬
facturers' Association. Individual factories began to give out increasing quantities of
work at below-log rates.80 Attempts to reduce factory rates were met with resistance by
the unionists, who had the advantage of union funds to back them.81 The sporadic, spon¬
taneous tactics, which had characterised worker resistance before the union was estab¬
lished, became strategic, co-ordinated and relatively effective resistance in the context of
the solidarity of the Tailoresses' Union. These tactics ensured the payment of log rates or
better in the major Melbourne factories and virtually eliminated the practice of taking
working home at night.82 In the long-term, however, the economic collapse of the 1890s
brought temporary defeat to the Tailoresses' Union, as it did to the male unions in the
clothing trade.83

The emergence of the Tailoresses' Union also reflected (and possibly contributed to) a
changing definition of femininity in the 1880s and 1890s. Although the majority of
female garment workers may have still aspired to the helpless, docile and retiring stereo¬
type, the tailoring factories seem to have attracted and fostered a more outspoken and
independent type of woman. Many, of course, were forced to reject the dominant stereo¬
type, finding, as did Cresswell, that it was of little use to a widow with young children.
It was not that these women were any less 'respectable' than their more genteel counter¬
parts in dressmaking, but that they had a different standard of virtue. Indeed, most
employers were at pains to maintain the moral tone of their factories and women were
said to be unwilling to give evidence to the 1883-84 Royal Commission on the Factories
Act as long as it met in an hotel.84 The 'new women' of the trade union movement left
the shelter of their homes to engage in picket duty outside the factories, reportedly using
'violent language and threats' to deter would-be strike-breakers.85 Employers found
such women, or 'girls' as they were usually called, 'very difficult to deal with' in that
'they have no consideration except for themselves' and 'have no faith in what you say'.86


-----

The growth of the union encouraged this spirit, so that by the late 1880s the Chief
Inspector of Factories reported that 'the factory work girl would appear to be a very diffi¬
cult person to deal with', who was 'as a rule able to take care of herself'.87

The Tailoresses' Union and the spirit of resistance it fostered succeeded, at least in the
1880s, in raising the average level of earnings for Melbourne tailoresses.88 It did this by
increasing the rates paid to the 'lower-class' hands and by insisting that slop-order work
be paid for at a higher rate than regular slop work.89 Indirectly, the wages of factory
workers probably also curtailed further erosion of outwork piece rates, since employers
could pay higher rates yet still be undercutting the tailoresses' log for inside work.

By forbidding the taking home of work by factory workers for completion after hours,
the union also made the 48-hour week more of a reality for tailoring workers.90 This is an
interesting instance of the agency of workers in contributing to the separation of home
and work, or 'work' and 'life'.91 Instead of this separation being something which is
imposed on workers for the convenience of industrial capitalism, it is clear that in this
case at least such a separation was the price workers had to pay for shorter working
hours. So long as work was taken home at night, there was no way of demarcating the
working day.

Ironically, however, the success of the Tailoresses' Union in maintaining the price and
improving the conditions of factory labour encouraged employers to embark on other
strategies to cheapen labour which gradually eroded the union's victory. Outwork
became even more attractive when cutting rates to indoor workers was no longer an
option. This was not a new strategy, since outwork had played an important role in Vic¬
torian garment-making from the establishment of the industry: the Inspector of Factories
for the City of Melbourne estimated that half the clothing trade in Melbourne was car¬
ried on outside factories in the 1870s and early 1880s.92 Employing outworkers had
numerous advantages for manufacturers. It relieved them of the expense of providing
factory buildings, as well as the cost of equipment and fuel. Because outwork drew on
the labour of isolated and often desperate workers, the piece rates paid were usually well
below those demanded by factory workers. The marked seasonal variations in demand
for clothing also meant that manufacturers did not have to bear the burden of plant and
equipment lying idle during the off-season. In this sense the advent of the sewing
machine in the 1850s had increased the burden on outdoor workers, who had to supply
their own machines instead of merely a needle and thread. Nor did the worker receive
any benefits from the increased speed these machines allowed. The Internationalist, a
Melbourne secularist journal, summed up the position: 'The sewing machine has not
abolished ill-paid work, nor has it diminished considerably the length of the day's toil.'93

The increasing competition amongst manufacturers as the market for Victorian cloth¬
ing stagnated after the early 1880s meant that more and more work was being given out¬
side, and the tailoresses' strike contributed to this trend by raising the price of factory
labour. However, as Fry points out, it is very difficult to make any definitive statements
about the extent of outwork because of the lack of detailed business or official records for
this period. 1 disagree with his guess that it was 'probably decreasing' during the 1880s,
for several reasons. Firstly, the general expansion of the industry was not matched by an
expansion of markets, increasing the pressure on employers to cheapen production.


-----

Secondly, the supply of female labour for factory work was not increasing as rapidly as
the supply of outworkers because of the marriage of the children of goldrush immi¬
grants. In 1889 the Chief Inspector of Factories reported that 'so great is the demand for
female labour that the factories go to the employees rather than that they should lose the
chance of the employees coming to them'.94 Factory employment figures support this
observation: the number of females employed in factories with more than five employees
declined from 4948 in 1886 to 4525 in 1890. The number of men in factories increased
over the same period from 1322 to 1499. It seems reasonable to assume that part of the
fall in female factory employment was the result of an increase in homeworkers. The
trend established in the 1880s towards increasing use of outworkers was intensified in
the 1890s under the pressures of general economic depression. Even the most modern
and efficient firms could not compete with the goods made by the cheap labour of
outworkers. Banks and Company's modern three-storey factory became a monument to
this process. Built in 1884 to accommodate 300 workers, it was by 1892 standing idle, its
hands discharged and its work transferred to a myriad of outworkers.95

This move by firms such as Banks, who had previously paid the union rates, signalled
the demise of the Tailoresses' Union. Clearly, the union's failure to tackle the outwork
issue was the major cause of its downfall. Why it did not do so is not entirely clear. The
initial log proposed by the union certainly showed an awareness of the problem: it pro¬
posed a separate scale of piece rates for outworkers which was consistently higher than
the scale for indoor work.96 The revised log, arrived at in negotiation with the Clothing
Manufacturers' Association, omitted the outworkers' log altogether. It is possible that
this was considered a strategic concession on the part of the union in order to prevent
further compromises on the log for inside work. It also seems to have reflected a deep
hostility between factory workers and homeworkers. Cresswell referred to 'people who
would not acknowledge themselves to be tailoresses [who] are carrying it out on the
quiet. They take it out from our places far below our prices and then they laugh at us.'97
Such was the depth of this hostility that outdoor workers who sought to join the union
were rejected. John Wing, the union's secretary, reported that the members 'classed them

[outworkers] as sweaters, and they thought if they joined the union it would bring prices

[piece rates] down'.98 This seems a curious logic, especially given that the tailoresses
acknowledged the existence of Targe numbers of people who must work out'. Mrs Jane
McLeod, a representative of the union, explained that she did not object to such people
working at home, only to the fact that they were underpaid.99 It is not clear how exclud¬
ing them from the union could have helped raise their rates of pay.

The relationship of the factory tailoresses to outworkers was, however, representative of
the general state of worker organisation in the tailoring trade. The craft exclusiveness which
helped win higher wages for this section of the clothing trade also acted as a brake on a more
unified worker organisation. The existence of six separate unions covering tailoring workers
alone was symptomatic of this narrowness. Order workers preferred not to combine with
stock workers, and male inside workers were also reluctant to admit those working out¬
side.100 Cutters, pressers and tailors also maintained their own organisations.101

Furthermore, men refused to form common associations with women. As one dis¬
gruntled tailor put it, 'Oh let the women look after themselves, they have taken our jobs.'102


-----

When a union of Outside Tailors was formed in 1890, the Tailors' Society noted with satis¬
faction that 'they are also anxious to work with us to suppress female labour'.103

The fact that some tailors did help manage the tailoresses' unions was the result of a
broader conception of strategy held by a few individuals rather than a widely felt sense
of common cause among the tailors as a whole.104 This sectionalism was to leave the
workers divided in the face of the unrestrained price-cutting of the 1890s, their craft
status cold comfort alongside the hunger and poverty accompanying low wages or none
at all. As the Australian Leather Journal put it, 'in the broad principles of business there is
no charity'.105 Like many other unionists in the 1890s, workers in the clothing trade saw
no hope in unionism, but turned once more to the legislature to alleviate their lot.

The few employers who continued to operate large factories sought to reduce their costs
by experimenting with new technologies (such as gas-powered machinery and new
machines for cutting and finishing) and new work processes (such as greater sub¬
division).106 Although the initiative for these innovations clearly came from management,
there is no suggestion that workers opposed them. Indeed, the evidence suggests that,
initially at least, workers welcomed power-driven machinery as a way of reducing the
physical stress of the treadles and of increasing their earnings. Henry Blomfield, proprietor
of a slop-tailoring factory, reported how his workers responded to his proposal to introduce
a gas engine on condition that they accept a 10 per cent reduction in piece rates:

I made them [the] proposition, not being able to do it out of my earnings, to erect a gas-engine and
plant necessary for driving all the engines, and I put it to them in that way that if I did that it would
entail certain expense, and independently of that the employing of a man at £2—10s a week ... I put
them in the position to earn more money than they could twelve years ago, if working fulltime.107

The catch, from the workers' point of view, was the condition 'if working fulltime'. This
became apparent only after they had agreed to the reduction. As Blomfield reported,
'they thought that this gas-engine was overrated'.108 To quell their dissatisfaction, Blom¬
field organised a demonstration using one of the machinists to show how much more
exhausting it was for workers to perform at high speed using the treadle rather than the
gas engine. While the workers were apparently convinced by this exercise, it is unlikely
that they had really made a good bargain in the short-term. In the environment of the
1890s, few factories worked full-time and those that did had greatly reduced staffs. The
secretary of the Tailoresses' Union estimated that in 1893 the average tailoress was earn¬
ing only 12 shillings a week because of short-time, compared to about 21 shillings for a
full week's work.109 Blomfield's own workforce had been reduced from 150 hands to 25.
Even with this reduction, the five men (three tailors and two pressers) were working on
average three days out of six.110 The gas engine might have allowed the machinists to
work at high speed for a longer period, but with limited orders for work this was of no
advantage to them, collectively or individually. Blomfield, on the other hand, got his
work done more cheaply.

Nor is there any suggestion that workers opposed the subdivision of labour, although, as
the last few months of the 1882-83 strike showed, tailoresses were keen to have sectional
work paid at rates comparable to other rates.111 The concern here was clearly a desire to
reduce exploitation rather than to maintain 'control' of the work in process per se.


-----

In the 1890s, work in tailoring factories was increasingly fragmented, with workers
employed on the table system performing increasingly simpler, repetitive finishing tasks.
Sarah Muir, a tailoress with twenty-three years' experience, described the 1890s version of
the table system, where a journeywoman had eight or nine apprentices working with her:
'some were kept at turning out the sleeves; some were turning over the edge of coats; some
were taking out the tacking, or sewing on buttons or sewing on tickets'.112 While there is
little evidence that workers opposed this process in general, there was clearly an awareness
that subdivision of labour acted as a check on greater homogenisation of the workforce
with factory production. As John Wing, secretary of the stock Tailoresses' Union, reported,
the subdivision of labour undermined the union because 'only one branch suffers a
reduction at a time, and the others not affected are not in sympathy with those suffering the
reduction, and they each distrust each other'.113 Wing, however, was not anxious to do
anything about the situation. He said he had not made himself prominent in 'stirring up'
the tailoresses because he did 'not believe in making the water muddy'.

Workers were, however, concerned about alterations to the method of payment.
Paying by the piece was the traditional method of payment in the clothing trade. As
Hobsbawm explains, payment by results (or the piece) was a 'degenerate form of the
price which the formerly independent artisan had been paid for the sale of his
product'.114 (Hence the common reference to piece rates as 'prices'.) In the 1880s custom
still prevailed, with only cutters and some machinists and finishers paid time rates. In the
case of cutters, the practice seems to have arisen with the development of ready-made
clothing. With cutters working on numerous layers of cloth at once, a slip of the knife
became a very costly mistake. By paying cutters for their time rather than their output,
employers encouraged greater care. From the cutters' point of view, this was a step for¬
ward. They did not have to work quickly in order to be the highest-paid workers in the
tailoring industry, and the fact that they were paid salaries marked them off from other
workers. As one employer explained, 'their salaries are a matter of private negotiation
and not to be made publicly known. They have their reputations to consider.'115

It is not clear why machinists were paid weekly wages rather than piece rates.
Probably it was because employers hoped to retain all the benefits arising from the faster
production made possible by the machines.

As competition amongst manufacturers increased in the late 1880s and 1890s, some
employers sought to extend the weekly wage system as a means of avoiding union rates for
piecework. As with the case of the taking home of work by tailoresses, this is an instance of
workers' actions precipitating changes to the structure of the working day and the manage¬
ment of industrial time. Strategies to defend piecework earnings thus inadvertently led to
counter-strategies by employers, and it was these counter-strategies which led ultimately to
the move from task-based payment to time payment in some sections of the tailoring trade.
As Richard Whipp has pointed out, and as these clothing industry cases demonstrate,
'Time in relation to work is for management and employees a potential commodity which
has to be created and its control and disposal negotiated.'116

The move to put pressers on weekly wages was successfully resisted by the Pressers'
Union in 1889, but in the depressed conditions of June 1892 the workers agreed to the
change.117 Other employers extended the practice to female table hands as well as


-----

machinists. Edward Bartlett, for instance, told the 1893 Factories Inquiry that he paid by
the week 'to avoid the log price for each garment'.118

While weekly wages were gradually replacing piece rates in ready-made tailoring,
there is no evidence that this was happening in order tailoring or in the other sections of
the clothing trade. For employers in these sections piece rates had the advantage of sim¬
plicity for accounting purposes. It was much easier to compute a worker's earnings by
counting trousers or dresses made than by calculating how much time he or she had
actually worked. Piecework also solved the problem of discipline to a large extent: if
workers did not work they did not produce and did not get paid. Employers thus saved
on the costs of supervision. Piecework had an additional advantage in that it enabled the
payment of outworkers on a convenient basis. And in the order trades, piece rates
absolved the employer of the responsibility of paying hands for idle time while they
waited for work. Even in relatively prosperous times, the demand for bespoke services
was extremely uneven.119

In the unorganised sections of the clothing industry employers also had less incentive
to experiment with new forms of payment for labour: less subtle ways of reducing the
wages bill were still open to them. Of these, the employment of cheaper juvenile labour
in place of adults was probably the most popular strategy in the 1890s depression.
Speeding up of workers was also common, either in conjunction with new machinery or
under the older hand methods.120 Tactics for ensuring maximum effort on the part of the
employees varied. Some employers used abuse to maintain discipline. Edward Bartlett,
for instance, a clothing manufacturer employing between 100 and 350 workers, told the
1893 Factories Inquiry that, yes, he did swear at the 'girls', but, T offer apologies, and we
are the best of friends, it is merely a lapsus linguae. I never do any one any injury.'121

Others were more subtle, drawing on notions of family and co-operation to lead rather
than to drive workers. The Busy Bee factory in Ballarat is a useful example. As the com¬
pany historian expressed this ideology: 'The "Busy Bee" girls were indeed not so much
hired helpers as an extension of her [the proprietor's] family, working beside her and her
daughters on a common project.'122 This attitude was common amongst nineteenth-
century manufacturers who drew on authority patterns within the family to reinforce
factory discipline. Wherever possible, younger workers were supervised by older
workers, and females by males. As George Denton, clothing manufacturer and pre¬
viously manager of Banks and Company's factory, explained: 'As far as my experience
goes, women would rather be looked after by men for foremen and so on. I would
sooner employ men to look after women.'123 The employment of members of the same
family within one factory often made this process easier. The relatively small scale of
most Victorian clothing factories and prevalence of working-proprietors also made this
style of authority easier to maintain than it would have been in larger, more impersonal
establishments. The latter sometimes took advantage of the limited liability legislation to
offer their supervisory staff shares in the company in the hope of infusing them with a
sense of personal investment in the success of their employer's business.124

The success of patriarchal-style authority was, however, limited by the strength of
such relations within Victorian working-class families. Nor should one be tempted to
romanticise the more personal style of management which prevailed in the smaller


-----

factories. Relations between employers and employees varied, with the more fortunate
approximating the happy family of employer rhetoric. Not so lucky were those who
worked in workrooms like this dressmaking business in West Geelong, reported on by a
factory inspector in 1896:

As an instance of how the girls are treated, I have been informed, a girl fainted some weeks ago, and
some of the girls went to render her some assistance. She [proprietor] ordered them back to their
places, stating she would soon come round; and for the half-hour or so, before she recovered, she
made her work an extra half hour to make up the time lost.125

Probably the most effective form of discipline was, however, the fear of unemployment.
The depression of the 1890s intensified this fear and made workers more vulnerable to
ill-treatment at the hands of their employers. With the unions in retreat, collective action
was ineffective in checking these abuses in the workplace. Collective action took on a
more political meaning, with workers looking to the Factories Act of 1896 as a way of
regulating the arbitrary authority of employers in the workplace, as well as providing
them with reasonable wages.

Both workers and employers attempted to influence the nature of work by affecting
government regulations relating to industry. Specifically, they hoped to protect their
interests by high tariffs to restrict import competition, and legislation to restrain 'unfair'
exploitation of workers by some employers. As earlier noted, campaigns on these issues
often involved alliances of workers with groups of employers. Large proprietors, in par¬
ticular, were keen to co-operate with unionists to enforce their own standards of wages
and conditions on their local rivals—the 'sweater' employing outworkers and the
'unscrupulous' employer paying substandard wages.126 Many manufacturers, especially
those not also involved in importing, were anxious to co-operate with unions to achieve

a high level of tariff protection for the clothing industry so as to ensure steady profits and
regular wages at acceptable levels for all.127.

The success of these strategies is less clear than their motives. The move for protective
tariffs, for instance, had contradictory effects. On the one hand tariffs made the local
product relatively cheaper, but at the same time they increased the price of imported
cloth and machinery (except sewing machines).128 The duties on imported machinery
may have discouraged some manufacturers from buying newer technology and making
the accompanying changes to the organisation of their factories.

Similarly, as we have seen, the factory legislation of the late nineteenth century pro¬
vided incentives to manufacturers to use outworkers in preference to inside labour. Both
the Factories Acts of 1873 and 1885 were intended to prevent the exploitation of female
labour, but ironically they encouraged the growth of small workrooms and homework
where rates of pay and conditions were at their worst. Such legislation might have
afforded some relief to female workers had a factory been defined as a place employing
two persons, as proposed in the original Bill. Modifications in both Houses, however,
raised the size to ten in the first instance and reduced it to six in 1885. Rather than help¬
ing eliminate cut-price labour, this legislation encouraged the small workroom and out¬
work, as employers sought to evade the provisions of the Act which applied to registered
factories only.129


-----

Renewed agitation in the 1890s to expose 'sweating' and amend the factories legis¬
lation was in the short-term also unsuccessful. The advertisement given to the low rates
paid by some firms encouraged competitors to reduce their rates as well. Harrison Ord,
Chief Inspector of Factories, reached the conclusion in 1895 that the campaign had in
fact been counter-productive:

For nearly ten years now the workers in the clothing trade have been questioned, and have supplied
information, so that amending legislation might be introduced to ameliorate their lot. Inquiries have
been made by a board and a committee and yearly reports issued from this office. The benefit to the
workers has, however, been worse than nil, since some employers who were paying higher prices
have lowered them.130

It remained to be seen whether the culmination of this agitation—the Factories and
Shops Act of 1896—would prove any more successful than its predecessors in dealing
with 'the sweating evil'.

 An Age of Grim Adversity: The Boot Industry, 1880-1896

In contrast to the clothing industry, the actions of organised workers in the boot trade
played a major role in precipitating mechanisation and subdivision of the labour process.
The boot industry shared many features with garment making: it was labour-intensive,
its product was highly portable and suitable to domestic production, and its product
market was also seasonal and vulnerable to import competition. The footwear and cloth¬
ing industries also experienced similar patterns of growth and stagnation. It differed in
one major respect: most of the workforce (between 70 and 75 per cent) was male. (See
Appendix, Table A4.) It is this fact which accounts for the very different pattern of
worker involvement in the shaping of work.

Because men generally did not have domestic duties tying them to the home, their
options in the paid workforce were wider. Men were able to adopt industrial strategies
which were not viable in female-dominated trades, as the history of the boot industry in
the 1880s and 1890s will show.

As the first Victorian contingent set forth for the Boer War in 1899, it was only fitting
that they were shod in Bedggood boots. Bedggoods' was the first boot factory in Mel¬
bourne, built in 1854, and for almost half a century had been the leading Victorian
manufacturer of footwear.1 The boots the soldiers wore to South Africa were similar in
style to the earliest products of the Richmond factory—strong boots made for hard work
and long wearing. But apart from the style, these military boots had little in common
with the handmade article found upon the feet of the army of goldrush immigrants in
the 1850s.2 The boot turned out of the major Melbourne factories in the 1890s was the
product of 'the march of the machine', which wrought a radical transformation in the
nature of bootmaking.3 As the Australian Leather Journal noted in 1899, 'There is scarcely


-----

an operation which was done long ago with pleasure to the doer which is not now
performed by the iron fingers of the machine.'4

The widespread introduction of specialised machinery into Victorian factories in the
early 1890s imposed regular hours, set tasks and other kinds of factory discipline on a
group of male workers who possessed recognised skills and a high degree of indepen¬
dence. Chummy Fleming, one of these 'workers of the old times style', recalled the
'devil-may-care' lives led by the 'Knights of St. Crispin' in the 1880s: 'We seldom worked
on Mondays. We worked as we pleased; no one feared the boss, for we lived free lives.'5
John Bedggood recalled that in the 1880s many operatives worked only five or six hours
a day by choice.6 Bootmakers were also notorious for honouring 'Saint Monday'. As the
Age commented: 'For some occult reason most of the general hands connected with boot
and shoe making will not work on the second day of the week.'7

This independence evaporated in the 1890s under the combined effects of economic
depression, mechanisation, subdivision of labour processes and the substitution of weekly
wages for piecework. In sharp contrast to the carefree ways of the 1880s (allowing for some
exaggeration on Fleming's part), workers at Whybrow's factory in 1895 were discharged if
they could not complete the task set by Arthur Whybrow.8 Perhaps even more significant
was the report to the Bootmakers' Union in the same year that 'Mr. Whybrow still con¬
tinued to discharge men if they were caught speaking to their shopmates.'9

This tightening of factory discipline was symptomatic of the general erosion of job
control experienced by bootmakers in the nineteenth century. This erosion was certainly
accelerated in the economic storms of the 1890s, but the process had been under way
since the middle of the century. Even the largely handmade boot made in Bedggood's
first factory passed through a number of different pairs of hands, so that subdivision of
the shoemaker's craft was part of factory production from the very beginning of the
Victorian trade.

The making of a shoe involved three major processes: the cutting out of the leather, the
shaping and joining of these pieces, and then the trimming and final preparation of the
finished shoe (including buffing, colouring and coating the surface of the leather). In the
hundreds of bespoke (or order) bootmakers' shops which sprang up in Melbourne in the
1850s, these processes were performed by hand, often by the same person. The male
hand-maker was frequently helped by members of his own family or apprentices. Where
women were employed, they usually sewed the uppers, particularly of women's shoes.
Apprentices helped out with the 'uncommonly fidgety work' of sewing round, as it was
described by 'An Oldster'.10

There were over 300 such workshops in Melbourne in 1861, employing between two
and twenty workers each, and catering mainly for the well-to-do market. Bedggoods
was one of the few local manufacturers making work boots, as most of this class of foot¬
wear was imported from Britain.11 With the imposition of a tariff on imported footwear
in 1866, local manufacturers became competitive and the bespoke workshops were
increasingly replaced by primitive factories to increase production for the ready-made
market.12 In these factories machinery was used to roll the leather prior to cutting (click¬
ing), but the cutting was still done by hand. The actual making, stitching and finishing
were given to workers who did the work in their own homes. As one nineteenth-century


-----

manufacturer recalled, at that time a 'boot factory consisted of little more than a clicking
room, a skin room, a rough-stuff room, and an office'.13

As was the case in clothing manufacture, subdivision of bootmaking into its various
processes (clicking, making, stitching, finishing) preceded mechanisation. Like garment
making, it was a product of the growth of wholesaling and its demand for a mass-
produced article, rather than new technologies.14 And as with the clothing industry, this
subdivision was initially accompanied by an expansion of outwork, and with it an
expanded role for women as upper stitchers.15

The major change away from homework occurred in the 1860s with the introduction
of treadle sewing machines to stitch the uppers. These machines were too expensive for
the average worker to buy, so their use drew women into factories which made the capi¬
tal outlay.16 The use of the Blake (or McKay) sole-sewing machine from 1876, meant that
the male clickers, stuff-cutters, sole-cutters and the female upper machinists were joined
inside the factory by increasing numbers of male makers, who shaped the upper and
fastened it to the sole.17 With the help of a 15 per cent tariff on imported footwear and
duty-free imports of upper leather, these Victorian factories flourished in the second half
of the 1870s and captured the home market for all but the high-quality lines, with the
export of local produce increasing from 58,000 pairs in 1876 to 157,000 in 1880.18 (See
Appendix, Figure A4.) In 1879, Whitten's boot factory in Ballarat, occupying a large
weatherboard building equipped with the latest machinery, employed fifty men in its
making room and twenty women in the preparation and sewing of uppers. Machinery
was used for some of the work in both sections, as it was in the cutting out of uppers,
soles and heels.19 There were no machines, however, for finishing, and the greater output
of the factories meant an increasing number of men employed finishing outside the fac¬
tories.20 These outworkers were supplied by an army of lads who swarmed over Mel¬
bourne, Fitzroy and Collingwood, pushing barrow-loads of boots in various stages of
construction.21 Nor were the manufacturers anxious to bring the finishers inside the fac¬
tories as they took up valuable space and were considered a 'nuisance, trouble and
expense as they must have gas burning'.22

Despite the advances of the late 1870s, the technology in Victorian boot factories was
fairly unsophisticated. Power-driven machinery was unusual, and the capital outlay on
new factories minimal. It was still possible in the 1870s for an enterprising bootmaker
with a few hundred pounds to set up as a manufacturer, and with the increased tariff on
imported footwear in 1879 more and more bootmakers were encouraged to do so.23

But the 1880s were not the years of unlimited expansion that many anticipated. At the
same time as the 1879 tariff changes gave an additional 5 per cent protection against
imported footwear, a duty of 7.5 per cent on imported calf and kid leather increased pro¬
duction costs. The increased capacity of Victoria's boot factories was not matched by an
expansion of markets. In fact, in the 1880s, imports of footwear increased whilst exports
decreased. (See Appendix, Figure A4.) The result was fierce competition amongst local
manufacturers for the remaining markets, and a quest for ways to cut prices and
production costs.24

This highly competitive market produced a crisis of valorisation for employers in the
boot industry. In response, manufacturers sought to reduce their labour costs by


-----

intensifying the work inside factories with the installation of gas engines to drive the
machines. By 1890, 30 per cent of registered boot factories used motive power, compared
to only 12 per cent in 18 80.25 At the same time, employers attempted to reduce the costs
of their hand labour—the large numbers of finishers working outside the factories—by
reducing piece rates. These attempts led to a strike and lockout in 1884-5 over the issue
of outwork. This strike or lockout, like the tailoresses' strike two years previously, was
the product of deteriorating industrial relations since the late 1870s. The good feeling
between masters and men which accompanied the expansion of the boot trade in the
1860s and 1870s could not survive the more competitive atmosphere which existed after
the market had been saturated. Many of the 'self-made' men continued to amass for¬
tunes by using cheaper boy labour and outside labour; the widening economic gap
between employers and employees became a symbol for the workers of the 'greed' of
these 'mushroom capitalists'.26 To add insult to injury, it seemed to the workers that the
manufacturers were deliberately deceitful in their dealings with the Operatives' Union,
agreeing to certain terms whilst in practice ignoring them.27

For their part, the manufacturers had become more and more exasperated with the
demands of the operatives, and particularly with the 'objectionable and dictatorial manner'
of their 'paid agent', W. E. Trenwith.28 Men who prided themselves on their 'grit' and 'inde¬
pendence' resented what they saw as interference with the running of their businesses by
the proposed Board of Conciliation.29 Many expressed surprise at the militancy of their
employees, blaming it all on Trenwith's demagoguery in the workplace.30 Trenwith, with
his buggy and top-hat, assumed monstrous proportions in the imaginations of these manu¬
facturers, and securing his defeat seemed to justify any tactics.

But the manufacturers, being hardy individualists, were divided amongst themselves.
As each sought to maintain his share of the market, the suspicion they felt for each other
was often greater than their sense of shared class interest. This produced wages and con¬
ditions which varied enormously from factory to factory, with no two manufacturers
paying the same price (piece rate).31

It was in this atmosphere of mutual fear, suspicion and chaotic piece rates and prac¬
tices that the Bootmakers' Union (VOBU) resolved to act. Established in 1879, by 1883 it
had recruited over 1000 members and had accumulated a substantial bank balance.32
Nevertheless, members were reluctant to strike, hoping to secure the co-operation of the
manufacturers to establish some order in the chaos.

The employers were likewise wary of confrontation, having no association of their
own until October 1882. Both sides agreed to a Board of Conciliation consisting of nine
representatives from the workers and nine from the employers, with an independent
chairman (in this case James Ferguson, MLA). After a laborious thirty-six meetings
extending over many months, the board agreed to a uniform log of prices, a limit to the
number of apprentices and a set proportion of hands on weekly wages to those on piece
rates in order to limit the use of weekly wages.33

Within days of the agreement between the union and the Manufacturers' Association,
three employers began to flout the log by putting their workers on weekly wages and by
cutting the prices paid to the largely non-union outworkers.34 The 1883 agreement had
said nothing about outwork, so in mid-1884 the union attempted to persuade the


-----

manufacturers to bring their outworkers inside the factories to help prevent price-cutting.
Unfortunately, the Manufacturers' Association had withdrawn from the Board of Con¬
ciliation, saying its membership had fallen away to an unrepresentative number.35 So the
union waited on the employers individually and, by August, had secured the agreement
of almost all of them to end outwork by October the same year (1884).36 At the same
time, the union was also engaged in a struggle over weekly wages being used to evade
the log prices.37

The bootmakers, raised on piecework and its relative independence, in general had a
horror of weekly wages. Their stated objection was that it usually meant working to a
task, and was thus a concealed form of sweating.38 Less openly stated but probably just
as real was the fear of factory discipline this implied, a discipline which bootmakers had
successfully evaded despite the erection of large factories and the installation of machin¬
ery. In the Victorian manufacturing context, weekly wages also usually meant sub¬
divided labour, a phenomenon which bootmakers were anxious to avoid as it too implied
a loss of control over the work process.

This is an instance of the difficulties in identifying the issue in dispute as either control
or exploitation. Clearly, the workers saw it as both. Weekly wages meant working to a
task (or quota) which meant both greater exploitation and loss of control over one's
working rhythms. Both of these implied a collective defeat for the workers. Trenwith's
explanation of the issue captures this inextricable connection: 'Later it became known
that the manufacturers were going to crush the union, if possible, by introducing what
they call the weekly wage system, but what in reality is a most pernicious system of
piecework at reduced prices—that is to say, what is commonly known as task work.'39 To
maintain piecework as the method of payment in boot factories, the union engaged in
1884 in two bitter strikes with the leading employers of weekly wage hands, Mair and
Company and McGan's. Mair and Company capitulated after a short struggle, but
McGan, treasurer of the Manufacturers' Association, held out for ten weeks before
giving in.40 It seemed the union had triumphed, but just at the point where its funds had
been depleted by strike pay, the Manufacturers' Association took the offensive over the
issue of outwork.

The issue was further complicated by the formation of a union amongst the workers at
the non-VOBU factories, which attempted to affiliate with the THC and claimed it stood
for 'weekly wages and the Eight hour day'.41 The employers hoped to exploit this
division amongst the workers for their own advantage. As a meeting of manufacturers
resolved to reject the agreement with the union about outwork as early as August, it
seems they were waiting to choose the most favourable time before confronting the
Bootmakers' Union.42

On 17 November 1884, a manifesto was posted in most Melbourne factories announc¬
ing the manufacturers' intention of 'reverting to the old system' of giving work outside. It
also proclaimed their intention to accept only those workers presenting certificates of dis¬
charge from their last employer—a move interpreted by the union as designed to victim¬
ise 'agitators'. The manifesto declared the employers' determination to prevent access of
union officials to their workplaces and to refuse to negotiate with anyone 'not directly
engaged in the trade', a thinly veiled reference to Trenwith.43


-----

The union retaliated by boycotting factories requiring certificates, banning overtime
and outwork by its members and insisting on negotiations by the union's officers. The
members also placed a 15 per cent levy on their earnings to build up their funds for
the expected strike. Significantly, the union expected the first confrontation at Mair
and Company, which was again trying to extend the weekly wage system.44 But the
employers acted first, locking out 300-400 men on 19 November, with more being dis¬
charged as they completed contracts on hand.45 Within days 1400 men were locked out
from sixty factories, and a further 700 female workers were unemployed due to the
absence of male operatives to perform the other parts of the manufacturing process.46

Both sides stood firm, the employers apparently determined to break the power of the
union, and the union equally convinced of the need to defend itself.47 The union's funds
were not exhausted as quickly as employers anticipated, as Ballarat workers continued to
pay the 15 per cent levy and funds flowed in from other unions who saw the principle of
unionism itself on trial.48 Even after the Ballarat employers were persuaded to aid their
city counterparts by locking out their own workers, the strike fund still managed to
pay 1400 men their allowance every Saturday. A number of the strikers formed
a co-operative boot factory and supported themselves, thus easing the burden on the
union's funds.49

This deadlock lasted for thirteen weeks, the unionists defending the picket lines with
vigilance and sometimes violence.50 By the end of January it was clear that the union's
funds were not drying up, whereas many manufacturers faced ruin. Negotiations in
early February, mediated by Mr Mirams, MLA, and Andrew Lyell, accountant, resulted
in a compromise.51 Employers agreed to forgo the discharge certificates, adhere to the
eight-hour day and to the limitation of weekly hands. On the crucial issue of outwork,
the employers agreed to the union demand to bring their outside workers into the factory,
but the union allowed them almost a year in which to arrange for the extra accommo¬
dation necessary. The union conceded the right of entry of its officials, agreeing that they
would not enter factory premises during working hours.52 On 11 February 1885, the boot
factories of Melbourne and Ballarat again opened their doors, but for men and masters
alike it was an uneasy peace, marked by even greater suspicion, tempered only by a
greater enthusiasm for conciliation after the bitter experiences of the previous months.

The costs for both sides had been high: the union had paid out over £9000 in strike
pay, while the manufacturers lost valuable contracts and intercolonial markets.53 The 700
women and girls thrown out of work were probably the worst affected, although they
fail to rate a mention in the existing accounts of the strike.54 Indeed, it appears to have
taken contemporaries three months to notice that these non-unionised females and their
dependents were without any financial support, having no access to the strike pay issued
to male unionists.55

The ramifications of the lockout were far-reaching, affecting both industrial relations
and the organisation of work in the footwear industry. Most importantly, once the fin¬
ishers were brought into the factories the whole climate of employer-employee relations
altered. Inside the factories, it was a relatively easy matter to unionise the workers,
whereas in their own homes they had been beyond the reach of organisation. The
employers were only too well aware of this, and the defeat of 1885, combined with the


-----

prospect of even greater worker solidarity, encouraged them to work more closely with
each other than they had previously done.

The restrictions on outwork also narrowed the options of employers still facing the
over-competitive local market. Since large-scale, cheap outwork was no longer possible,
manufacturers looked for ways to cheapen production inside their factories. Many began
to experiment with new machinery and greater subdivision of labour, hoping thus to
reduce their labour costs. The introduction of machinery also weakened the union.56 As
unemployment rose in the boot trade in the late 1880s, these strategies began to pay off
and, one by one, the factories abandoned the 1884 log until by 1892 only a few adhered
to it.57 The stage was set for the large-scale mechanisation undertaken by boot manufac¬
turers during the depressed years of 1892-95.

The most obvious targets for mechanisation were the processes of lasting and finish¬
ing, so far untouched by the technological innovations which had been introduced in
England and the USA, and the only branches of bootmaking still done exclusively by
hand.58 With more of the finishing being done inside the factories, this incentive was
even stronger. Many proprietors did insist on their workers paying for the gas they used
to keep their pots of pitch warm, but from the manufacturers' point of view having them
on the premises was still an additional and unnecessary expense, particularly as factory
workers demanded higher piece rates than outworkers.59

The move to modernise Victoria's boot factories began in earnest in 1891 when
Smalley and Harkness installed that 'most wonderful of machines', the Goodyear welter
and chain stitcher.60 Other manufacturers followed suit, taking advantage of the leasing
facilities offered by the United Shoe Machinery Company.61 Between 1892 and 1895
lasting and heeling machines arrived in the major factories, and were accompanied by an
immediate subdivision of the making process and the use of weekly wages instead of
piecework.62 The final blow to handwork came in 1893-95 when leading firms such as
Bedggoods bought the newest American finishing machines, which saved over 50 per
cent of the labour in finishing. These machines did everything from shaping the instep to
buffing the finished product.63 Thus the boots which came out of the twenty or so large,
modern factories in Melbourne in the late 1890s were entirely machine-made, passing
through about twenty different pairs of hands in the process of conversion from cut
leather to footwear.64 Factories making strong work were slower to mechanise, but by the
turn of the century they too were installing more machinery.65

This rapid mechanisation in Melbourne's leading boot factories in the 1890s had a
number of effects on the structure of the industry as a whole. Firstly, the saving of hand
labour displaced hundreds of male factory workers, whose occupations disappeared
virtually overnight.66 The last of the processes to be mechanised were in many ways the
most difficult, and most highly paid. As one old bootmaker put it, these shoemakers Tost
half their work and their high consideration in one blow'.67 Arthur Whybrow, a 'modern'
manufacturer who had himself risen from the bench, described the process whereby
machines displaced skilled men:

In the making and finishing of a boot the most particular parts that require the most skill are done by
machines now. Take the operation of lasting, getting in the toes, which was a most difficult


-----

operation—that is all done by lasting machines, and one man will do as much in a day as perhaps 30
men could under the old conditions, and the other men have to do work which requires not much
skill at all; therefore a man who could earn very high wages because he was exceptionally skilful—
his occupation is gone.68

Men displaced by the machines were forced to take whatever unskilled work they could
pick up, or attempt to eke out an existence as cobblers, repairing the machine-made
boots. Others swelled the numbers of outworkers competing for the work given out
by those factories unable to afford the latest technology.69 The improved productivity
of the mechanised factories as a result of the greater speed of the machines and the
speeding-up of labour under the team system (subdivision plus tasks), made the old-
style factories increasingly less competitive. In an effort to avoid being squeezed out by
the large firms, these manufacturers reduced piecework rates again and again, but many
businesses failed anyway.70 The increasing price of leather in the second half of the 1890s
added further to the problems of the less productive factories, and large numbers of
smaller factories turned their workers out and closed their doors forever.71 Others, such
as the Ballarat factories, joined the trend toward mechanisation rather than face
extinction.72

Secondly, the increased capacity and speed of the mechanised factories led, on the one
hand, to over-production and, on the other, to an intensification of the seasonal vari¬
ations in trade.73 As one contemporary commentator remarked, 'the dreary gaps
between cheerful busy seasons are ever growing longer'.74

Inside the mechanised factories, the impact of all the new machines had a profound
effect on the atmosphere of the workshop. In the modern factories of the late 1890s,

everywhere one meets with rapidly whirling wheels, revolving knives and spinning brushes. Leather
shavings fly from the knives, and what with the thumping of the presses, the grating of the rollers, the
roar and rattle and clanking of various machines ... in the near future speaking trumpets will form
pdrt and parcel of a boot factory's 'kit'.75

The men who worked the new machines were still exposed to the health risks, especially
tuberculosis, caused by the particles of dust and the vapours associated with
bootmaking, but they also had to work at greater speed.76 Gone were the days when
forty men would be kept hanging about the factory playing draughts 'simply at the con¬
venience of the employer'.77 With the new regime of weekly wages the employers made
sure all workers were well-supplied with work, and any man not completing his quota
was discharged. In the mid-1890s there were at least three men waiting to take the place
of every unemployed hand, so the pressure was more than an idle threat.78

In addition, the new machinery sometimes meant new risks. Apart from the added
dangers of physical entanglement with machinery, some machines produced symptoms
akin to those now recognised as being the result of repetition strain injury. Men holding
their work with both hands against a polishing wheel, for instance, developed injuries
produced by the force and the vibration.79

The subdivision of bootmaking,'by which each operator contributes an exceedingly
small portion towards the building of a boot', also made it easier for employers to use


-----

inexperienced labour in place of trained men.80 Boys, in particular, were cheap and easily
trained in the new methods.81 Boot operative Thomas Richards reported:

I can quote a shop where, in the finishing department, they used to average from 12 to 16 men. With
machinery, that department is turning out the same amount of boots with really only two
journeymen in it. They are doing the amount with the machines the 15 or 16 men were doing before.
They crowd the boys into that department.82

The whole apprenticeship system, already under threat in the 1880s, was abandoned in
most factories. If a lad wanted to learn to make a boot throughout in order, for instance,
to 'make and mend boots with simple appliances in country towns', he would not
acquire such knowledge in a factory.83 Before the widespread use of machinery, appren¬
tices in factories were lined up on a bench under the supervision of the most competent
journeyman, and taught their trade. With the use of machinery and consequent sub¬
division of processes, an apprentice would be employed on one process only, 'with
nobody to tell him whether he is right or wrong'.84 Under such conditions, a lad in a
modern factory had in most cases, 'literally to pick up his trade'.85 The result was that
apprentices, or 'improvers', learnt very little beyond one particular process, and when
they became eligible at twenty-one for an adult wage were discharged in favour of
fresh youths.

Workers had contributed to the reorganisation of the work process and of the industry
as a whole in the 1890s, just as they had in the 1880s. The very fact that so many out¬
workers had been brought inside the factories and the apparent boost this gave to the
union influenced employers in choosing strategies to deal with the valorisation crises of
the depression. But in general the initiative shifted in this decade to the employers who
seized every opportunity to capitalise on the workers' weakness in a period of high
unemployment. And whereas the trials of the bootmakers in the 1880s had been tem¬
pered by triumph, in the 1890s their experience was one of unmitigated 'grim
adversity'.86 The decade began badly, with employers taking the offensive again by sack¬
ing union hands. The ensuing strikes were lost because of the availability of blacklegs—a
sad defeat for the union leaders who cherished fond memories of the solidarity of 1884.87
This was a serious reverse for the union and, with their funds depleted by assistance to
the maritime strikers, the workers were badly placed to cope with the trials of the
depression.88 The failure of the union's attempt to establish a branch in Geelong was also
ominous, as it provided a pool of non-union labour close to the Melbourne market.89

Over the early years of the depression, from 1890 to 1892, more and more factories
abandoned the 1884 log despite repeated strikes against reductions. The union was
forced to renegotiate this log, and conceded reductions amounting to about 12 per cent
on all lines except strong work. To a large extent, the 1892 log reflected the change in fac¬
tory organisation from a 'primitive' to a 'modern' system which had occurred since the
mid-1880s.90 The rates devised for the 1884 log reflected custom rather than costing,
paying work on the basis of the quality of the work rather than the time taken in its mak¬
ing.91 Strong work was therefore paid less than fine work, even though it took longer.92
In contrast, the 1892 log was based on the more precise costing methods being employed
along with new machinery and labour processes.93 Despite the general 'modernisation'


-----

of the log, however, the union refused the manufacturers' request to recognise formally
the weekly system of payment and subdivision of work.94 The timely imposition of a
new tariff averted even greater concessions on the union's part.95

Although the 1892 log was in general considerably lower than the 1884 'statement', it
was still not low enough for some manufacturers. Those producing strong work in par¬
ticular either gave up this line, introduced machinery or paid less than the union rate. As
strong work was well-suited to outwork, being still predominantly a hand process, it was
a simple matter to contract the work out at cut rates.96 Within the factories the prices
were also gradually whittled away until, by 1894, few were paying the 1892 log rate.
The larger firms who had paid the log introduced more machinery to cope with this
competition.97

It would be misleading, however, to portray the union in these years as completely
defeated. Although membership had fallen away, funds were running low and unionists
were discharged at many factories, the members who remained carried on a continuous
campaign to resist reductions which succeeded in at least modifying the proposed rates.98
Even when these efforts were totally defeated, the resistance was by no means token. The
strike against outwork at the Hotham boot factory in 1893, for instance, lasted several
months before being defeated by the use of scab labour.99 And although by 1894 only fif¬
teen out of about sixty-five factories in Melbourne still adhered to the union agreement,
these included the major manufacturers in the colony.100 The year 1894 saw an increase in
strike action against non-statement employers, but it was not on sufficiently large or sys¬
tematic a scale to influence the general trend in wages.101 By late 1894 the union employers
were complaining of the unfair competition of the non-statement shops, and urged the
union to mount a more thorough-going campaign.102 Although the union was not optimis¬
tic of success, the campaign began on 3 September 1894.103

By November the number of 'statement' shops had been increased from fifteen to
fifty-six, a clear majority of the trade. Of the 1050 men originally on strike, 775 had
reportedly returned to work on the union's terms.104 But although the initial victory
belonged to the union, the war was far from won. The non-union shops held out for over
six months by sending their work to the non-unionised workers in Geelong.105 The
strikers eventually lost faith in victory and abandoned their picket lines. Others went
back to work, unable to carry on once the union's strike pay had run out. A few battled
on regardless of their isolation, but by May 1895 they too had surrendered.106 One of the
strike leaders, J. W. Billson, was boycotted by the manufacturers and forced to leave the
colony in search of work.107

The year 1895 was therefore the darkest one the union had ever experienced. The
membership, numbering more than 1000 in 1890, was down to about 400. Many of
these were on short-time, so that the flow of dues diminished to a mere trickle.108
Whereas Trenwith had enjoyed a fee of three pounds per week for his services, his suc¬
cessor had to make do with one pound.109 Thus weakened, the workers faced another
threat: the substitution of weekly wages for piecework and the subdivision of their work.

From the employers' point of view, weekly wages were clearly seen as a way of obtaining
a more disciplined and diligent workforce. One of the leading advocates of 'modern
methods', Arthur Whybrow, explained the difference between the two systems as he saw it:


-----

The weekly wage system has elevated the men, and we have no St. Crispin's Monday now like we
used to under the piecework regime. The men have to be in the factory at eight o'clock in the morn¬
ing, and they have to stay there till five o'clock. The new conditions have made better men of them
altogether.110

Although couched in terms of the betterment of the workers, it is clear what benefits
accrued to employers. Having invested in so much expensive machinery, they were not
prepared to see it stand idle whenever pieceworkers decided it did not suit them to work.
And the workers' suspicion that weekly wages entailed working to a task or quota was
well founded. There would have been no point in having men in the factory all day if
they were allowed to work at their own pace. 'We gauge the capacity of the staff in the
room', said Whybrow/and we have work given out in accordance with that capacity ...
The foreman sees that every man does his fair share.'111

The union's objections to weekly wages in the 1890s remained the same as those
expressed during the 1884 lockout: the system was a way of speeding up workers and
cutting rates of pay by working to a task. Weekly wages were 'but the means of getting
work done cheaply'.112 However, in the harsher economic circumstances of the 1890s,
the men were forced to compromise on this issue, as they were on the general question
of mechanisation.

The mechanisation drive of the 1890s was met with apprehension by the workers, fearful
that the machines would cause additional unemployment. The union made careful
enquiries of their counterparts overseas to find out what impact they had had on the
workers abroad. The responses were encouraging: the English union reported that the last¬
ing machinery available in the early 1890s was not very fast and had not displaced many
men. On this assumption, then, the union did not oppose its introduction in Victoria.113

By 1895, however, newer models were available and these did affect the employment
of workers, particularly finishers. But by then the union was powerless to resist. The situ¬
ation was made worse by the bad harvest and increasing price of leather, which retarded
the recovery of the industry as a whole.114 Accepting the inevitable, the union resolved to
oppose any innovations in the work process not connected with the machinery. In par¬
ticular, it was opposed to the subdivision of hand labour and the use of weekly wages
except in conjunction with machinery.

For instance, when in 1894 the employers' association first suggested subdividing
hand-finishing into four steps in order to compete with the speed of the machines, a
majority of the members sided with Anarchist, Chummy Fleming, and voted to reject the
subdivision of labour without machinery.115 The meeting also rejected an amendment to
this motion, proposed by the union president, J. W. Billson, to allow for subdivision pro¬
viding that 'present prices should be paid'.116 The question of subdivision thus continued
as a major issue between unionists and employers. In January 1896, one manufacturer
reported that 'we have had more friction with the operatives as to subdivision of labour
than as to price'.117

Experience over the following years confirmed the men's suspicion that weekly wages
meant working to a task, a situation akin to slavery in the mind of the bootmaker. Robert
Solly, union secretary, recalled Whybrow's attempt to introduce this system:


-----

On one occasion a man stood behind me with a watch, timing me while I was doing a boot. I said to
him—'I am not going to work under that system. 1 am prepared to do a fair day's work, but I am not
going to be a slave.' I had that spirit within me that I would not knuckle down to a man like that.118

The union had managed to prevent the general use of subdivision of hand labour in
early 1894, but by 1895 independence of spirit was not enough on its own to overcome
the obstacles to the union's continued success: lack of funds and excess labour.119
Whereas militantly anti-union firms like Marshall's of Port Melbourne had for many
years employed the 'team system', in 1895 they were joined by some of the supposedly
friendly employers.120 Two of the biggest firms, Whybrow's and Thomson's, announced
their intention to use subdivision and weekly work after the failure of the union to
enforce the 1892 log. A strike and lockout at Thomson's factory lasting several months
became the test case for the 'team system', and the union's defeat encouraged other
employers to follow Thomson's lead.121 Meanwhile, Whybrow's had also introduced a
system of discharging recalcitrant and slow workers and replacing them with faster,
more docile men.122 In their determination to introduce the new system, the manufac¬
turers brought out a number of workmen from England who had experience of the
newest methods and machinery.123 Sporadic resistance to both the team system and
wage reductions continued throughout the remainder of 1895 and 1896.124

This resistance had limited success in modifying some of the more objectionable
aspects of the task system. At Whybrow's, for instance, the stopwatch disappeared from
the shop floor. 'We do not record what each individual does', reported Arthur Whybrow
in 1904.125 Nevertheless, the foreman saw that every man did 'his fair share'. One of the
virtues of the team system, from the manufacturers' point of view, was that it made
identification of individual 'slacking' a simple matter. The 'test is that if there is a block at
a machine or elsewhere we know there must be something wrong'.126

On the other hand, the system also had potential for collective regulation of output;
the workers' successful opposition to time-and-motion studies no doubt made such
pacing a more viable strategy of resistance to increased exploitation. Given the men's
record of solidarity, it is highly likely that they adjusted their output to what they con¬
sidered a 'fair' day's work. And this standard of fairness, as Hobsbawm has pointed out,
varied according to a complex range of physiological, social, technical, moral and historic
considerations.127

In the context of general defeat in the face of the employers' campaign to cut rates of
pay and subdivide work, however, this was a small victory. For the most part the union
abandoned the struggle and bided its time, hoping for relief from the Factories Act where
industrial action had failed.128

The case of the Victorian bootmakers in the 1880s and 1890s shows very clearly how
workers' initiatives and responses can have a deciding impact on the shaping of work. The
tragic irony is that the impact was not the one the workers intended or would have wished
for. Had the workers not succeeded in the 1880s in eliminating outwork by finishers, the
employers would have responded quite differently to the economic crises of the 1890s.
Faced with dwindling profits, it would have been far simpler to cut the costs of their labour


-----

by reducing wage rates. Where outworkers were the norm, this was quite an easy matter.
Besides, had finishing continued as an outwork process it is less likely that manufacturers
would have considered putting in new machinery as this would have meant extending their
buildings. Had it not been for the 1884 lockout, the boot industry in the 1890s would most
probably have adopted the same course of action as that followed in the clothing trades:
extension of the outwork system on ever-decreasing piece rates. It was because this alterna¬
tive means of extracting surplus value had been closed to them that employers adopted
mechanisation as a last resort. Victorian boot manufacturing in the 1890s thus replicated
a pattern which occurred in Britain in the mid-Victorian era.129

The question of gender played an important part in the bootmakers' success in limit¬
ing outwork. Unlike female clothing outworkers, male boot workers were not usually
tied to the home by their domestic duties within the family. The sexual division of labour
in the home in fact encouraged the absence of the male 'breadwinner', making the men's
move to the factory both possible and acceptable. Because clothing outworkers were
usually women, a strategy of abolishing homework was not considered, nor would it
have succeeded.

The trade-off made by the male boot workers in 1884 in sacrificing the independence
of the outworker in order to maintain their earnings had much greater long-term effects
than anticipated. The bootmakers hoped to resist factory discipline and the degradation
of their skills by opposing weekly wages and subdivision, but their earlier action in
encouraging the extension of the factory system was to place them at the mercy of the
employers and their machines. The other concession they made in agreeing to the use of
weekly wages and subdivision in conjunction with machinery was also counter¬
productive, as it too encouraged the installation of even more machines, and opened the
way for less skilled labour, mainly boys, to be employed in place of tradesmen. And as
the decade following the 1896 Factory Act would show, this 'boy-labour' was to have
very serious consequences.

Unlike some industries, however, there was no attempt in the twenty years before the
1896 Act to use female labour instead of male labour in boot factories, although 'men
outside the union' allegedly had 'their wives and families to assist them' with out¬
work.130 Mechanisation affected women's work in the boot trade much less than men's.
They were still largely restricted to the sewing of uppers, although within this occu¬
pation there was now a more noticeable division between those who prepared the work
(fitters) and those who sewed it (machinists).131 Since the 1880s more factories had also
installed gas engines to drive the sewing machines, and, as in the men's departments,
there were complaints of untrained juveniles displacing adult women. Apart from these
changes, little had altered since the 1860s.132 A few women were employed in the pack¬
ing department, supposedly because the 'work appeals to the artistic talent latent in so
many women', where boxmaking, gold-stamping and embossing machines had been
installed in more modern factories.133 Buttonholing and eyeletting machines had also
speeded up these tedious operations.134 Women did not suffer unemployment to any¬
where near the extent that men did as a result of mechanisation and subdivision,
but there was no alteration of the sexual division of labour accompanying
mechanisation.135


-----

The main reason why employers did not attempt to replace male with female workers
seems to have been the boot factory's lack of appeal to female workers. Even in the
depressed years of the 1890s, there was reportedly 'no excess labor in females'.136 Boot
factory work was 'generally not considered a very desirable life for the girls'.137 For
employers, the question of female labour was more a matter of obtaining enough women
for 'female' work than extending it to 'male' occupations. To this end, they offered higher
starting wages to girls than other manufacturing industries. Where girls in the clothing
trades started out on two shillings and sixpence per week or, in many cases, nothing at
all, boot workers began on five shillings. Employers were at pains to dispel the Tow'
image which their factories had. John Cairns, for example, had males and females
starting and finishing work at different times: 'We do not like the two sexes to mix, to
give the factory a bad name', Cairns explained.138 The sexes were also kept rigidly segre¬
gated inside the factories. Whitten's boot factory in Ballarat took the added precaution, in
the interests of respectability, of posting a sign in the upper room which read: 'Notice.—
Smoking strictly prohibited by the girls.'139 Placing females alongside males in the work¬
shop was therefore temporarily impractical and would have been detrimental to the
employers' interests in the long term.

A further reason why employers would have been reluctant to experiment with female
labour in the 1890s was the attitude of the females themselves. They had a record of soli¬
darity with male workers whenever attacks were made on men's wages or conditions.140
Since women had struck against victimisation of male unionists and reductions in
male rates of pay, it seems unlikely that they would have agreed to do men's work at
cheaper rates.

Women were less militant on their own behalf. Although a Female Boot Operatives'
Society was formed in 1890, it had a chequered existence in the subsequent six years. In
February 1893 the male unionists of the VOBU considered it desirable to co-operate with
Sydney socialist-feminist, Rose Summerfield, in 'reorganising the Machinists'.141 These
efforts were apparently not very successful, as the task of re-forming the union had to be
undertaken again in 1894 and again in 189 6.142 And although during these years the
women were involved in at least half a dozen strikes, all of these were in support of men.
On one occasion, in 1894, women were reportedly dissatisfied with 'the very low wages
paid' and 'seemed determined to better their Condition', but nothing seems to have come
of this resolve either in increased wages or strike action.143 The result of this inertia was
that they were 'underpaid', a fact which even employers admitted.144 In the 1880s, the
average adult female could earn only fifteen to twenty shillings per week.145 In the year
before the Wages Board Determination, only 233 out of 1265 received twenty shillings or
more.146 The low wages paid to female boot workers had an effect on the labour process
similar to that of low wages in the clothing trade. With the cost of labour so cheap,
employers had little reason to experiment with 'labour-saving' machinery in the uppers
department.

It is not entirely clear, however, why the fitters and machinists were so much more
militant in men's causes than their own. (One reason for the uncertainty is that the
records of the female union have not survived.) The explanation probably lies in the fact
that family, community and work were all closely connected in the boot trades,


-----

especially in Melbourne. It is no doubt significant that all the women involved in forming
the female union were single.147 By defending men's wages and conditions, female boot
workers were also defending the livelihood of their fathers, brothers and future hus¬
bands. Or to put it another way, the defence of men's earnings was seen as the front line
in the battle for the survival of the family economy. Women's wages, by comparison,
were of secondary importance. In better times, their earnings 'did something to keep the
pot boiling'; in times of depression this contribution became even more important.148
Nevertheless, for most boot factory workers, earnings of men were the major source of
family income. That women did not seek wage increases for themselves may in fact have
been seen as one way to preserve male rates: increases in female wages may have pro¬
voked employers to cut male rates even further. The Wages Board, on the other hand,
promised wage justice for all workers. The year 1896 therefore saw a revival in the
female union, women as well as men hoping to share in the benefits of the new
regime.149

There were signs that the boot industry was also reviving. Export markets, particularly
in Western Australia, began to expand after 1895 and the general recovery from this time
also aided boot manufacturers. However, this was offset to a large extent by the rising
price of leather over the same period, so that the Boot Board faced a still uncertain econ¬
omic climate when it finally brought down its first determination in 1897.150

 Drawing the Line: The Printing Industries, 1880-1900

In nineteenth-century Victoria only four girls were apprenticed as compositors, and
those who had acquired skill at 'type-snatching' elsewhere were rarely employed in Vic¬
toria's composing rooms. The 1891 Census recorded only fourteen women compositors
compared to 1514 men, and there was no increase in the number of women by 1901.
Girls seeking employment in the printing industries were restricted to a narrow range of
occupations associated with bookbinding and stationery manufacture. The sexual
division of work in the commercial printing industry is well illustrated by the firm of
Sands and McDougall.1 Visitors to the firm's new factory in Spencer Street in 1889
would have seen workers of both sexes performing their separate tasks in much the same
way as workers in other large printing firms throughout the city.2 On the top floor, they
would have entered that male stronghold, the composing room. Although light and well-
ventilated compared to most Victorian composing rooms, the general atmosphere would
nevertheless have been oppressive, especially in summer, with the air thick with lead
and uncomfortably heated by the hundreds of gaslights required to give the comps a
clear view of their work. In this room the compositors selected the individual letters, and
so on, for the line of type and set them in a hand-held stick. These lines were then locked
together in a frame to make a forme, or large sheet of metal type. Once corrected by
male readers, a mat made from this forme was carried to the presses, where male stereo¬
typers fitted it into the cylindrical power-driven drums. The whole of this printing pro¬
cess was handled by men. The first female hands to touch the process were those of the
folders, who received great sheets of printed paper from the presses. The sheets had to be
folded, either by machine or by hand, so that they ended up in the correct order. Some¬
times they also had to be cut with long knives. Machines for folding were introduced in
the 1890s and, in this case, the woman fed each sheet into the machine. Once folded,


-----

bundles of these sheets were placed on long tables in correct order. Another woman, a
gatherer, then walked along beside the table, picking up a sheet from each pile until she
had a complete article. This was handed to another woman, a collator, who checked that
the pages were all in correct order. Any illustrations were then added, either by the col¬
lator or a separate woman. A woman working a machine by hand would then number
the pages consecutively. The item was then ready for 'sewing', a process which covered
both sewing with thread and metal stapling. In each case the operation was performed
by a woman, either by hand or, less frequently, on power-driven machines. In the case of
large books, grooves were first sawn in the back by men to receive the sewing.

If the article was a magazine or paperback book, a woman would paste on its cover (a
task known as wrappering). If it was a bound book, she would add endpapers and paste
down the projecting tapes to the flyleaf. At this point the bulk of the women's work was
done, and the book passed into the hands of men who nipped the back (that is, placed it
in a machine to press the back); cut the edges smooth in a guillotine; glued muslin on the
back and sides; made a groove, by hand or machine, at each side of the back, so that the
cover would lie flat; cut the covering boards and cloth and pasted them together. The
book then went to the blocking-room where more men stamped on any design and let¬
tering. Covers were then fixed by pasting down the endpapers, and the book was 'built
up' in a large press. Any gilding was also done by men, as was marbling and colouring of
edges. The completed book was then checked and packed.3

In the vellum-binding department, the visitor witnessed the binding of ledgers,
account books, day books, diaries, bank books, and so on, whether bound in vellum or
not. In this department women would be seen folding and sewing as in the printing
department, and men performed the later stages of cutting the fabric and boards for
covering and fixing the sewn sections of the book together. In addition, females also
numbered pages and cheque books, and did perforating and binding work with cut flush
covers such as cheque books and common exercise books. Men were also engaged in
ruling pages by machine and working indexing machines. As with the printing depart¬
ment, women were allowed to bind only those articles which were cut flush, that is, not
requiring the covers turned in over boards and endpapers.

In the stationery department, workers produced envelopes, blotting pads, exercise
books, folios, black bordering, files and stamps. As in the other departments, men would
be seen cutting the materials and doing any ruling, while women were occupied folding,
'cementing' (gluing) and packing the finished article. As a general rule, only men
handled leather and metal, the former used to cover blotting pads, and the latter to pro¬
vide a fixture in portfolios.

In addition to the above stationery lines, Sands and McDougall also produced
mounted cards and maps. Again, men cut the paper and boards for mounting, and
women covered the boards with paper and glued on the print. Work mounted on calico
was done by men. Greeting cards were also produced here, and the same divisions
applied, with women performing the packing. In the cardboard-box and carton section,
almost all the workers were female, the exception being the men engaged to work the
guillotine machines.

Folding pages and sewing them together preparatory to binding was work which had


-----

traditionally belonged to women, but by the time the Victorian industry started in the
1850s women were also doing the gathering, collating and wrappering and in the 1880s
they also moved into the binding of items with covers which were cut flush, such as
cheque books and common exercise books.4

Should the visitors have returned to Sands and McDougall's ten years later (1899),
they would have noticed a similarly rigid sexual division of labour, but the line had been
redrawn. In addition to the work already performed by women, they would also be seen
making leather-cornered blotting pads, recognised as 'girls' work' in 1891, and in 1898
the binding of 'quarter-bound books, cut-flush with turned in paper sides' was trans¬
ferred to female workers. In practice this meant higher-quality exercise books and some
folio account books.5

In the newspaper industry, there was virtually no scope for female workers. The entire
staffs of the Melbourne daily newspaper offices were male, the only four female com¬
positors apprenticed in Victoria being employed in Massina and Company's commercial
printing works.6 Victorian employers showed less enthusiasm for female compositors
than their Sydney counterparts, and Melbourne had no equivalent of Louisa Lawson's
Dawn, a feminist-inspired attempt to encourage women to enter typesetting. There were
isolated cases of country newspapers employing young women to distribute type (i.e. to
sort used type back into the case), but these were exceptions to the general rule.7 Never¬
theless, the proportion of females engaged in registered printing factories doubled
between the early 1880s and the end of the century, with 1889-90 and 1896-99 the
periods of sharpest increase. (See Appendix, Table A5.) But this was due more to struc¬
tural changes in the industry as a whole, resulting in an expansion of 'female' jobs, than
any major invasion of male occupations by women. At the same time, some male jobs,
such as hand composition, contracted in the late 1890s as a result of the installation in
daily newspapers of 'iron comps', or linotype machines.

The structural changes which accounted for the greatest increase in the proportion of
female workers derived both from changes in the product market and from technological
innovation. Before the diversification of printing in the 1880s, the industry was almost
entirely based on the production of the Melbourne daily newspapers. Production of
books was negligible, and a few big firms such as Sands and McDougall, Massina and
Company, Firth and McCutcheon and Detmolds dominated the commercial jobbing and
stationery trade, which received its main impetus from the growth of weeklv and period¬
ical publications in the 1870s. Their main competitors were the small suburban and
country enterprises set up by ex-journeymen, who operated with a starting capital of less
than £100 and the cheap labour of boys.8 As the bigger firms continued to expand and
mechanise in the late 1880s, these small businesses multiplied, relying on low wages to
remain competitive against the rapid labour-saving methods of the big concerns. Never¬
theless, employment in the printing industry in the late nineteenth century was charac¬
terised by a high level of seasonality and general instability.9

Unlike the infant boot and clothing industries, printing did not attract protective tariffs
from governments unwilling to impose a 'tax on knowledge'. This, combined with the
continuing prejudice against colonial goods, meant that almost all books were imported,
as well as most trade brochures and even state school textbooks.10 The expansion of the


-----

1880s was based on bigger newspapers, longer runs and multiple editions rather than on
new dailies, and on the growth of specialised periodicals, advertising and some station¬
ery lines. The application of web rotary speeded up the operation of the presses and
necessitated the employment of large numbers of compositors to feed the frames at one
end and increasing numbers of workers, many female, to fold, collate, sew and bind the
printed pages at the other end.11

The 1890s depression had a particularly devastating effect on the jobbing section of
the industry, with a dramatic decline in both the number of firms and volume of work,
causing both severe unemployment and short-time amongst the workers. In contrast to
those in the newspaper offices, however, workers in the commercial jobbing firms were
not severely affected by the introduction of the linotype machines in the late 1890s. By
1906 only three Melbourne firms outside the newspaper offices had Mergenthalers: there
were four at Sands and McDougall, two at Massina's and one at Fitchett Brothers. Even
in these firms the impact was not as severe as in the newspaper composing rooms, as
most of the hand compositors were retained for smaller orders. By comparison, the
impact on newspaper offices was severe, with both the Age and the Argus discharging
over two-thirds of their composing staff after installing linotypes in 1896.12

In the bookbinding department, however, mechanical innovations were less dramatic.
Guillotines and hand-backing machines had been in common use since the 1850s. In the
late 1880s and 1890s machines were developed for sewing, collating, folding, cutting,
rounding and backing, but these were not in general use in Victoria in this period. Case¬
making machines were an important invention, but they did not appear in Australia until
the turn of the twentieth century.13 In the absence of technological innovations,
employers in bookbinding relied on cheapening human labour to cut costs. The major
way in which they sought to do this was by replacing trained adult male workers with
cheaper female or boy labour. As we have seen, however, there was no dramatic shift
in the sexual division of work in the printing industry in the late nineteenth century.
To understand why this was so requires an appreciation of industrial relations in
this industry.

The class of work open to females in bookbinding was determined by a Tine of demar¬
cation', 'imported into Australia from the Old World, when the industry was commenced
here'. This line was defined by the male Bookbinders Union after negotiation with
employers, and was jealously guarded by a 'loyal and vigilant membership' against
incursions on 'their' territory. The definition of the 'line' was spelt out in the union rules,
and members were fortified in their 'loyalty and vigilance' by the prospect of a ten-
shilling fine for failure to report to the union any breaches of the rule.14

The employers, for their part, were keen to use female labour wherever possible. They
often preferred girls to boys on binding work in any case, as girls were said to be cleaner
and more careful in performing the folding and gluing associated with bookbinding. The
Chief Inspector of Factories, for instance, reported that 'much of the work in this trade is
admirably adapted for women, requiring as it does neatness and quick manipulation
with the fingers'.15 When the change from hand to machine case-making occurred in the
late 1890s, employers were keen to have this work classified for females.16 The men
fought successfully to prevent this happening, and this proved to be an important victory

for the colonial men as twentieth-century trends in bookbinding saw an increasing
volume of books bound in this way using the Sheridan case-making machine.17 But they
were forced to make other concessions during the 1890s, including accepting temporary
cuts in their wages.18

Women were thus still excluded from the bulk of publishers' binding and ledger¬
making, restricted to the cheaper classes of work which had simple paperback covers cut
flush with the pages or covered in paper. Other attempts by James McDougall and his
fellow employers to employ girls on 'skilled' work met with stiff opposition from the
men. Even threats by McDougall to close up his entire pocket-book department, and by
Detmolds to reduce wages by 15 per cent unless the demarcation line was reconsidered,
failed to extract further concessions.19

Significantly, it was the larger firms like Sands and McDougall's who led the way in
using more female labour. Most of the bookbinding and stationery manufacturing was
performed by several large, heavily-capitalised firms, usually as an adjunct to printing,
so that they faced competition from each other rather than from the smaller cut-price
operator who plagued the printing section. Indeed, the rivalry between these firms led
them to report each other to the Bookbinders Union for breaches of the union's rules.20
When even so-called reputable employers like Sands and McDougall's attempted to
coerce their female workers into evading the Factories Act, there was little scope for stra¬
tegic alliances between unionists and groups of employers.21 In these circumstances, the
Bookbinders Union was able to retain its influence only by maintaining 100 per cent
unionism amongst male employees in the trade, a task made easier by the concentration
of workers in larger factories. Nevertheless, the employers displayed a remarkable per¬
sistence in their attempts to move the demarcation line to encompass more females. The
fact that this line was so arbitrary in the first place aided the employers. That is, it was a
big move to train girls in composing type when they had performed no similar work
before. But in bookbinding, the women were used to doing similar work to that per¬
formed by the men, sometimes in the same room. Under such circumstances it was
relatively easy to move the women to the 'men's work'.

In theory, of course, the division was between 'skilled' and 'unskilled' work rather
than between males and females. Work classed as 'skilled' was, according to union rules,
to be performed exclusively by journeymen or apprentices at the appropriate rate of pay.
Thus, unqualified males were also excluded from skilled work. On several occasions
employers did try to use boys instead of men, but the male Bookbinders Union was
sufficiently strong to insist on a strict ratio of one juvenile to every three journeymen.22
In practice, because very few unindentured boys were employed, the rule operated
against females, who were not admitted to apprenticeships in bookbinding.23

Women's work, by contrast, was not recognised as skilled because they could not con¬
trol the entry into their craft of unapprenticed 'trainee' labour. This process occurred,
however, before the establishment of the Victorian bookbinding industry. Unable to
maintain the definition of their traditional work as skilled, they were denied access to
'men's' work, which was preserved as a skilled craft.24

It will be clear from the above that the line of demarcation was sharply drawn at any
given time. As William Detmold was told by the union when he attempted to stretch a

point: 'Our rules does [sic] very clearly define what skilled and unskilled work is.'25 It
was, nonetheless, flexible in the sense that it could be renegotiated at any point. In many
ways, it was like the front line of battle, with employers and male unionists fighting over
the disputed territory. The women were caught in the middle, not consulted by either
side, silent casualties of the conflict. The weak points in the demarcation line were the
simpler tasks performed by the journeymen, and any new operations arising as a result
of changed work processes or new products, such as the making of cloth cases
by machine.

This case demonstrates only too clearly the social construction of any definition of
skill. The definition was determined not so much by the actual characteristics of the work
performed as by the relative bargaining power of workers and bosses at any given time.
The low status accorded female work reflected women's weak bargaining position in
the industry.

Unlike male bookbinders, female print workers had no formal union organisation in
the nineteenth century. They did sometimes engage in industrial action to maintain rates
and conditions: factory-specific strikes occasionally occurred even in the absence of
union officials and funds.26 But such action was not effective in raising the general level
of wages, and women's rates were low by comparison with men's. While adult women
were paid between ten and twenty shillings for a full week's work, male bookbinders
were paid between fifty and sixty shillings.27

Such low rates of pay had consequences for the work process as well as for the women
who received them. The cheapness of female labour probably deterred mechanisation in
bookbinding and stationery, as it did in the clothing trade. The use of folding machines is
an instance. These were not used in Victorian commercial printing firms to any great
extent in the nineteenth century. In Britain, however, they were used more extensively,
particularly by firms which worked a night shift. The difference was that women were
forbidden under the English factory laws from working night shifts, so that folding had
to be done at night by more expensive male labour. Folding machines were thus econ¬
omical if replacing men but not if replacing cheaper women.28 In Victoria, by contrast,
night shifts in commercial printing firms were rare, so employers continued to use their
cheap hand labour in preference to the new machines. In newspaper offices, however,
where women's employment was dispensed with because of the night-work prohibition,
machines were used to fold the papers.29

In the male sections of bookbinding, wages remained comparatively high. Employers
were anxious to reduce labour costs in this section by extending female labour if possible.
This was much cheaper and simpler than mechanisation. When these attempts failed
because of the the determined opposition of the male unionists, employers embraced the
machines instead. The introduction of the Sheridan case-maker is the most striking
example, its introduction following a move by employers to have case-work classified as
'unskilled' (female) labour.30

Male compositors were as concerned as bookbinders about the threat of female labour
and organised even more effectively than the bookbinders in excluding women from
'their' work. There was no place for women in the intensely masculine world of the com¬
posing room, where the Fathers of the Chapels maintained the traditional rituals of


-----

initiation and discipline, and the companionship maintained its solidarity in the equally
masculine camaraderie of the ale-house. The Victorian typographers had a carefully
articulated position on the question of female labour which is well illustrated by an
exchange initiated by John Hancock, the editor of the Australasian Typographical Journal.

Woman, declared Hancock, is 'a more dangerous foe to labour than John Chinaman
himself'.31 This denunciation was prompted by news of female compositors employed by

' "women's rights" faddists' in Sydney, 'advanced thinkers' who were the sworn foes of
trades unionism, or so the editor argued. His comments sparked off a lively exchange in
December 1889 and January 1890, but not with anti-unionists as the editor perhaps had
expected. Rather, the person who sprang to the defence of women's employment was
socialist and loyal trade unionist, William Lane. Writing in the Brisbane Boomerang, Lane
attacked the misogynist outbursts of Hancock; the debate that ensued exposed the
deeper layers of the compositors' objections to female labour. The typographers'
response to Lane's argument throws light on their hostility to women as fellow workers,
whilst it also illuminates the more subtle issue of sexual identity and its effects on work¬
place politics and methods of work.

Lane took the Typographical Journal to task on its stated intention to 'refuse to recog¬
nise any office which employs women in the composing room', arguing that because
female labour had been used to break down wages was no reason to oppose women as
women. He pleaded for a woman's right to enter any occupation on the grounds of jus¬
tice, deploring the notion that she should always be compelled to seek her livelihood as
an 'accommodating housekeeper'. Whilst he agreed that cheap female labour was a
problem, he urged united organisation rather than exclusion: 'The printers won't find the
girls clamouring for lower wages; if they take them by the hand and teach them the prin¬
ciples of organisation and the wrongs of labour they will find in women mates, not
enemies; staunch allies, not secret foes.'32 He inferred that the reason they did not adopt
his course was because of their 'slavish idea that half the race is born solely to cook for
and bear children to the other half'.

The Typographical Journal took great exception to these 'extraordinary theories', which
seemed to challenge the natural order of gender relations. It found nothing objectionable
in the idea that one half of the race was born to cook, etc., for the other half, and was
surprised that Lane thought otherwise, especially as his views on labour topics were 'as
a rule, thoroughly sound'. It asked rhetorically: 'Surely our Brisbane friend does not
want the woman to print and the man to stop at home to make the beds!'33 Assuming the
answer to be 'no', it pointed out that 'the humble position of a maid-of-all-work offers
more scope for the proper training of a working-man's wife than can be secured by
taking a man's place in a printing office'. By the same token, it made no sense to intro¬
duce what was essentially casual labour to break down the wages of male breadwinners.

Clearly, the gulf between Lane and Hancock was very wide. Lane's utopian ideals, as
Bruce Scates' recent study has shown, prompted him to consider a new gender order.34
Hancock, at that time more inspired by craft exclusivism than socialism, could see the
issue only in the context of the social and cultural status quo. Most women did marry and
leave the paid workforce; most men became breadwinners; whenever women had been
introduced into male occupations it had been as cheaper labour, which undermined the


-----

ability of male breadwinners to provide for their families; therefore, it was to the advan¬
tage of both men and women that women should be kept out of men's jobs. All this was
entirely consistent with the world view apparently shared by the overwhelming majority
of compositors.35 True, it took no account of single girls supporting themselves and
others, nor of mothers left to provide for children. But these were seen as exceptions to
an otherwise comfortable rule.

To accept this rationale as the complete explanation of the typographers' hostility to
women workers would, however, be to miss a less obvious but nonetheless significant
objection. They certainly objected to female labour because it was cheap, but they also
objected to it when it was the same price as male labour. When the New South Wales
typographers voted on the question of admitting properly qualified female compositors
receiving the male rate of pay, only four supported their admission.36 Melbourne's
printers were even more united on the question, and unanimously rejected a qualified
journeywoman who applied to join their society on the same terms as men.37 Female
compositors threatened more than the printers' livelihood; they also threatened their
sense of manliness. The spectre of the woman printing and the man making the beds
was just as haunting, whatever the wages paid to the woman.

Compositors were already vulnerable when it came to the manliness of their occu¬
pation. As Cynthia Cockburn has demonstrated, composing, with its strong element of
intellectual work, placed its practitioners in an ambiguous position, exposing them to the
charge of effeminacy often levelled at such occupations as clerical work.38 Until the
1880s and 1890s the compositors had managed to retain a manly image by the con¬
ditions under which they worked and by the performance of the heavy work of lifting
the typeset formes. There was also a sense in which the possession of a skill bestowed on
craftsmen both manly pride and independence, as Richard Middleton explained to the
1884 Royal Commission on Shops and Factories:

An imperfect knowledge of his trade cripples a boy for life . .. [l]t prevents the growth of his man¬
hood. When he becomes a man he cannot assert himself as a man conscious of his artistic strength
should do—he has to succumb to unscrupulous employers and take what he can get; but when he is
master of the trade he can act in a manly part in engaging with his employer.39

This manly independence was further supported by the self-conscious male camaraderie
of the Chapel and pub. So when in the late nineteenth century feminists and others
singled out their work as being ideally suited to women, male compositors were under¬
standably defensive.40 Whilst conceding that the quick eyes and fingers and painstaking
natures of women might be admirably suited to 'type-snatching', they protested that this
did not mean the work was therefore Tight and clean', the accepted criteria of suitable
feminine employment. On the contrary, they argued that the women 'cannot make up,
neither can they impose and make forms ready for press, or correct forms on the press, as
well as men. That is a physical impossibility.'41 As for the work's alleged cleanliness, the
Typographical journal protested that the 'close, malodorous atmosphere of a printing
office, with all its grimy surroundings . . . permanently injure a young woman, both in
body and soul'. Also believed harmful to the delicate feminine sensibilities was the set¬
ting of certain printed matter, such as anatomical textbooks and sensational newspapers,


-----

whereas night work in newspaper offices was considered so obviously undesirable for
women that no reason needed to be given. Furthermore, not only was the work unsuit¬
able, but 'daily contact with the males must necessarily have a tendency to destroy the
timidity and modesty which usually characterise the sex'. Thus, women who 'unsexed
themselves' by doing 'man's work' became 'manny' in their habits, and were reported to
be found drinking in the front of English bars with other companions who followed the
custom of adjourning to a public-house after work.42 All things considered, nothing
short of the 'abolition of girl labour' would satisfy the male compositors.

As we have seen, the Victorian printers were remarkably successful in their aim. The
first four girls apprenticed at Massina's in 1884 were also to be the last: Massina's agreed
not to repeat the experiment, whilst other firms desiring cheaper labour made do with
boys.43 Whereas Sydney masters obtained trained female compositors from New Zea¬
land, few seem to have made their way to Victoria. The Factories Act of 1885 effectively
took care of their chances of obtaining work on the daily newspapers by prohibiting
night work for women and boys. It was no coincidence that the typographers' union
played a large part in the agitation for this Act, realising the double-edged 'protection'
afforded by such protective legislation.

The preservation of composing as a masculine occupation had important reper¬
cussions for the way in which the craft was performed. The English experience had
shown that where women were employed in composing rooms they were restricted to the
lighter tasks of setting and imposing the type, men being employed to carry the finished
formes to the presses.44

The absence of women in Victoria's composing rooms meant that until the introduc¬
tion of the linotype, the compositor's work was not subdivided, the compositor perform¬
ing the full range of tasks. Denied cheaper female labour for the 'type-snatching',
employers were doubly anxious to obtain practical models of the new linotype machines
to offset the economic pressures of the 1890s. As with girl labour, Massina's were the
first to experiment with the machines.45 And whereas in the 1880s the Typographical
Society was powerful enough to insist on the exclusion of women, by the time the lino¬
type machines arrived in the second half of the 1890s the union was so weakened by the
effects of the depression that it offered no resistance. Had the linotype not offered such a
dramatic saving to newspaper proprietors, they might have been tempted to try cheaper
female labour instead, and the typographers would have been hard-pressed to
prevent them.46

The general course of industrial relations reflected the typographers' change in for¬
tunes. The printing industry was divided between the heavily capitalised large firms and
the small suburban and country newspaper and jobbing offices. As in the clothing trade,
this division offered opportunities for alliances between workers and employers. In this
case, the thirty or so bigger firms belonging to the Master Printers' Association (MPA)
co-operated with the union during the prosperous 1880s to enforce uniform standards of
pay and conditions upon the smaller firms. Together they tackled the question of boy
labour: the employers were anxious to limit undercutting by smaller firms using cheaper
labour, and the union was anxious to retain its bargaining position by controlling the
number entering the trade. As the episode at Massina's shows, they were equally


-----

co-operative when it came to female labour. This alliance was very effective in raising the
general level of male wages in the 1880s.47

The successes of the Typographical Society in the 1880s, however, made the MPA
wary of the union it had fostered, and many members began to fear the power of the
'monster' they had nurtured. When the depression came in the 1890s, they were only too
happy to abandon the alliance and take their chances using the new machines against
the competition with shops using cheap labour. As mentioned earlier, the compositors
for their part offered no resistance to the introduction of the linotype. With funds and
membership severely affected by the depression, their chances of resisting successfully
were very slim. The Typographical Journal argued that resistance would be inappropriate
to a society whose motto was 'Defence, not Defiance', and that in any case such defiance
would be futile.48 Rather, the union placed its hopes in defending the privileges of those
who remained in work by securing a reasonable rate of payment. As the Board of Man¬
agement explained, 'Your Board has recognised the fact that it would be futile upon its
part to attempt to obstruct the use of labour-saving machinery, but it has claimed for the
limited number of future workers a fair share of the profits resulting from the use of such
improved appliances.'49 True to its stated intention, the society's journal regularly carried
the advertisement seen in Figure 8, with its graphic message for the superfluous 'hands'.

Other factors may also have influenced the typographers to accept the linotypes with¬
out a fight. Ava Baron's study of the USA printing industry found that 'men embraced
the linotype because its dirty work made it less respectable for women'. Cynthia
Cockburn comments of the British scene that 'to many of the men, the clatter and clunk
of the linotype if anything enhanced the manly qualities of the occupation'. Such con¬
siderations may also have weighed with Victorian compositors, who kept themselves
well-informed about overseas developments in this area. Victorian compositors, indeed,
seemed confident that women represented no threat to male employment on the
machines, a complacency which was not felt as regards boys.50

The society was successful, after considerable negotiation, in obtaining an agreement
with the MPA to use only qualified society members on the machines and to pay them an
agreed rate whilst learning to operate. Apprentices were allowed on the machines only in
their final year, and hours of work were to be restricted to forty-two per week.51 This
agreement, and the fact that several employers either pensioned off their older composi¬
tors or offered retrenchment pay, ensured that the linotypes did not 'cause the trouble
that was expected'.52

That the union was able to secure such favourable terms was largely due to its earlier
success in keeping non-society members (including women) out of the trade and the soli¬
darity of members in the new crisis or, to quote the editor of the union journal, 'all that
was wanted to secure success was the loyalty of the men'. Of course, the task was made
easier by the fact that the economy was beginning to recover when the machines arrived
in 1895. And the men's unity and determination was inspired by the threat the machines
posed to them collectively as well as individually. The linotype threatened the
craftsmen's control on the job. Members were warned that firms 'are preparing to throw
their faithful workmen out into the cold and to call in the aid of the inanimate toiler, who
is much more amenable to discipline than the ordinary intelligent compositor [my emphasis]'.53

Australasian Typographical Journal, 1 September 1908. (ANU Archives of Business & Labour)

It was vital that unionists regulate access to the machines in order that they have some
control over the rates of pay and hours of work, but also over the effect the machines
would have on the general balance of power between workers and employers in the


-----

composing room. The struggle was thus about exploitation, but it was also about control,
or 'bossing', as Cohen puts it.54 And the two issues were inextricably linked, since the
loss of control implied increased exploitation.

The experience of the printing craftsmen in the face of mechanisation contrasts
sharply with that of the male boot operatives in the same period. Unable to control entry
of non-union labour to the trade, the bootmakers could not regulate the conditions under
which the new machines were introduced. They were unable to prevent the use of boys
as operators or to insist on piecework rather than weekly wages.

The printers, on the other hand, prevented both. Apprentices, as we have seen, were
allowed on the machines only in their final year. As regards time payment, employers
reportedly wanted this rather than piecework because 'they considered that the machines
would be treated better'. The union's objections to the weekly wage system were similar
to the bootmakers': 'it was generally believed', reported the secretary, Hancock, 'that, by
the adoption of the stab [established weekly wage] system, they would lose their
independence'.55 Unionists also feared that 'under the wages system they would have a
system of tasks' whereby everyone would be speeded up and the slowest discharged.56
The minority who favoured the time system did so because 'under the piece system the
operator had not to depend on his own ability, but on his machine or on the person who
kept it in order'.57 This was a real problem with earlier typesetting machines such as the
Hattersley, which were notoriously unreliable. But early experience of the linotype
proved that this was not a serious consideration, and, in any case, the union secured the
employers' agreement to pay for such lost time.58 Piece rates also had the advantage, as
London compositors found, that any increase in the productivity of the machines and the
men would accrue to workers rather than management.59 Indeed, this is likely to be the
real reason employers favoured time rates, since piece operators had as much to lose as
employers by abuse of the machines.

The employers, however, were keen to get the machines at almost any price and the
Master Printers' Association agreed 'almost unanimously' to the society's terms. Most
importantly, the major Melbourne dailies—Argus, Age and Herald—worked their banks
of linotypes on the union conditions and 'expressed their satisfaction with its
operations'.60

Given the success of the linotype in newspaper offices, it is perhaps surprising that
more jobbing offices did not install the machines. They were available on lease from the
Mergenthaler company, so the cost of acquiring them was reduced. Jenny Williams has
tackled this question in her study of the diffusion of new technology in the printing
industry at the turn of the century. She concludes that Victoria lacked the necessary econ¬
omic, political and social framework needed to sustain the new technology's take-off.
More specifically, the industry had no tariff protection and the system of technical edu¬
cation at the time was inadequate to meet the demands of the new technology.61

But there was more to it than Williams' analysis suggests. Only four commercial
printers installed linotypes, and then only a total of seven machines.62 The newspaper
offices, as we have seen, embraced the new machines wholeheartedly, replacing up to
two-thirds of their compositors in the process. For them the machines made sense, as
they needed to produce large quantities of typeset material as quickly as possible.


-----

The relatively large market for their single product—that is, the daily newspaper—
justified heavy capital outlay. By contrast, the commercial printers supplied an enor¬
mously varied market, from wedding invitations to the Sands and McDougall Directory.
Although the latter work was appropriate to the linotype, and indeed this was why
Sands and McDougall's installed them, the smaller jobs were more efficiently set by
hand. There was no significant book trade in Victoria at the time, partly because of the
lack of protection against imported books, partly because of prejudice against the col¬
onial item, and partly because the Australian market for books was, in any case, not very
large. The bulk of the commercial printer's work was therefore not suitable to the use of
the linotype. However, by the same token, it was not adapted to the use of cheaper
female or boy labour, requiring as it did experienced compositors skilled in layout and
the use of borders and different typefaces.

The printing industry in the late nineteenth century thus produced similar patterns to
those found in clothing and boot manufacture. Where labour was relatively cheap, the
tendency was for more extensive use of hand labour; where it was more expensive,
employers introduced machinery in an attempt to intensify the productivity of the
workers. And in each case, gender proved the deciding factor: men's work, which was
more expensive, was mechanised, while cheaper female work remained handicraft or
was mechanised to a much lesser extent. Other factors, most notably market demands for
varied products in small quantities, placed limits on this mechanisation. Government
intervention was of lesser importance. The twentieth century, by contrast, would alter the
state's role considerably, beginning with the 1896 Shops and Factories Act which marked
the era of special boards for the fixation of wages and conditions.

###### PART II

 Under the

 Wages Boards


-----

-----

The rooms are often small and with the members tightly packed around the table, most of them
smoking, they present a crowded, dingy and uncomfortable appearance.1

A description of the proceedings of an underground political group? On the contrary.
Professor Hammond's words, written in 1914, describe the meetings of the Victorian
Wages Board, a legally constituted wage-fixing body. These deliberations, conducted in
the back rooms of the offices of the Chief Inspector of Factories, represented a new
departure in Victorian industrial relations: for the first time a state-constituted body
attempted to regulate the labour market. Certainly, there had been boards of conciliation
in the past, but this time the boards were provided with a chairman whose casting vote
could ensure a verdict where collective bargaining failed to reach consensus. The
decisions of the Wages Boards were also backed by the authority of the state, which had
power to prosecute and fine parties breaching the boards' determinations. In order to
understand the history of individual industries under the Wages Boards, it is important to
have a more general appreciation of the system and the context in which it operated
between 1897 and 1925, the year in which the last of the three industries (printing) made
its approach to the federal Arbitration Court.

The new Shops and Factories Act was finally promulgated in 1896 after a stormy pas¬
sage through the Legislative Council. It provided for the establishment of 'special'
boards in five specified 'sweated' trades, and the registration of outworkers. Both these
provisions were major parts of the original proposal which hoped to control the 'sweat¬
ing' of defenceless female workers.2 On the other hand, amendments which limited the
Act's duration to a period of three years placed the boards on an insecure footing from
the outset. Not until 1905 were they assured of a permanent existence.3

The board system, as it operated for most of its first decades of existence, consisted of
five representatives each from the employers and employees, with an 'independent'
chairman. With the exception of a period in 1902-03, chairmen had a casting vote in the
deliberations.4 The selection of worker and employer delegates was determined accord¬
ing to regulations framed by the Executive Council. In the first instance, representatives
were appointed by the Minister for Labour, who published his nominations in the
Government Gazette. Employer representatives had to be chosen from amongst the regis¬
tered factory proprietors, while worker representatives had to be bona fide employees
who had worked at their trade for at least six months in the preceding three years. Elec¬
tions occurred only if objection was made to the Minister's nominations by at least one-
fifth of either side. Should an election be called, a roll of electors was compiled from lists
of registered occupiers (employers) and employer returns of workers aged eighteen years
and over. Outworkers were entitled to separate representation where their numbers con¬
stituted more than one-fifth of all employees.5 Although elections were held in the early
years of the boards' existence, they became less common as both sides formed them¬
selves into organisations which made recommendations to the Minister.6 Only in unusual
circumstances were the Minister's nominations challenged, as we shall see in the sub¬
sequent chapters on the clothing and boot industries. However, full-time union officials,
or 'Trades Hall hangers-on' as one Legislative Councillor dubbed them, were expressly
prohibited from taking seats on the board until 1934, as also were company managers.7


-----

Chairmen were elected by the board members, the Governor in Council making the
appointment only when the delegates failed to agree.8 Given the emphasis on concili¬
ation, it is ironic that from the outset the boards' most prominent chairmen were police
magistrates, men accustomed to making judgements rather than orchestrating compro¬
mise. In 1908, for instance, two police magistrates between them chaired ten of the
forty-six boards. Former senior civil servants were also a popular choice, four of them
accounting for a further nine boards. Four ministers of religion between them chaired six
boards, whilst one energetic estate agent sat on eight. The remaining thirteen boards
were chaired by an assortment of business and professional men ranging from a shop¬
keeper to a quantity surveyor.9 No women were chosen. Only in a few cases did the
chairmen have previous personal knowledge of the trade covered by their board.10

The success of this method of selecting chairmen depended very much on the personal
qualities and experience of the individuals concerned. In some cases, such as that of the
Underclothing Board discussed in Chapter Four below, the task proved too much for the
man chosen, whereas in others the tact and patience emanating from the chair encour¬
aged a speedy resolution of conflicts.11 But often the bias of chairmen was all too
evident.

In addition to the chairmen and delegates, each board was provided with a secretary,
generally one of the staff of the department of the Chief Inspector of Factories. Where
boards had female members, one of the 'lady inspectors' acted as secretary.12

Boards were usually appointed for a term of three years, but revisions to a determi¬
nation could be made at any time during that period. Meetings were held in the late
afternoon or in the evening.13 Board members were paid for each session attended. Fees
were generous by current wage standards, particularly for female members.14

Once constituted, the boards met to discuss the determination. Proceedings were gen¬
erally informal, conducted around a table with the chairman sitting between the two
groups of delegates. Not all were held in the small rooms referred to in Hammond's
opening description; some were held in the 'spacious dignity of a conference chamber'.15
In the early stages of discussion, the opposing parties generally addressed remarks to the
chair in order to sway his vote to their side. As Hammond observed, the chairman's
power was often more real than apparent. Some chairmen prided themselves on being
able to secure a consensus agreement. But in reality they often let the members know
what they were prepared to accept (usually a compromise) and one or other side would
move the motion to which the other side then agreed.16

There was, however, no guarantee that at the end of this often lengthy process workers
would receive the wages prescribed in the determinations. There were mechanisms for
appeal, and a great deal depended on how effectively the legislation was administered. The
main burden of administration fell on the shoulders of the Chief Inspector of Factories and
his staff. The personal experience and attitudes of these civil servants were clearly crucial
in determining the effectiveness of the whole Wages Board system. As Ernest Aves, an
official British reporter on the system, observed, the 'administration would be wrecked not
less surely by excessive partisanship than by an attitude of passive resistance'.17

In this respect, at least initially, Victoria seems to have been fortunate in its public
officials. Harrison Ord, Chief Inspector of Factories for the first thirteen years of the


-----

system's existence, had a personal commitment to the scheme. Indeed, he had been
closely involved in drawing up the Act of 1896.18 Although he was by no means always
popular with either workers or employers, his enthusiasm and energy were acknowl¬
edged by all.19 From the outset he selected a staff of inspectors who shared his outlook.
Miss Margaret Gardiner Cuthbertson held the position of Senior Lady Inspector.
Like Ord, she had a clerical background of public service administration.20 Their
administrative experience was supplemented by the practical expertise of a team of
sixteen inspectors, three of whom were women. Most of these had previously
worked at one or other of the trades covered by the boards.21 The effectiveness of their
surveillance varied greatly with the size of the establishment, the number of factories
in the inspector's district, and the energy, astuteness and integrity of individual
inspectors.22

The problem of systematically and regularly visiting outworkers was clearly the most
serious deficiency in the inspectorate system. Although outworkers were registered
under the Act, their frequent changes of address and their large numbers, particularly in
the earlier period, made comprehensive surveillance practically impossible.23 In 1897
there were 2382 outworkers registered in Victoria. Although this number declined to 955
in 1903, by 1906 it had increased again to 1431.24 Unregistered outworkers escaped
surveillance altogether.25

In the event of apparent breaches of the determination being discovered, the
allegations would be taken before either a justice of the peace or a police magistrate. On
conviction, the court could fine the offender, but it had no power to order arrears for
underpayment of wages until an amendment in 1909.26

The Wages Board and inspection system described above operated in each of our three
industries for varying periods between 1897 and 1925. The Wages Board scheme was
not, however, static during these years. On the contrary, legislative amendments, particu¬
larly in the period before 1910, involved important changes to the powers of the boards.
In general, these extended the coverage of the board system but curtailed its powers,
especially in regard to apprenticeship restrictions.27 (The power to limit apprentices was
restored in 1910.) Apart from minor amendments in 1915, the system's framework
remained unchanged throughout this period.28

In contrast to the legislative stability existing after 1910, administration of the system
fluctuated. The diligence and enthusiasm which Harrison Ord brought to the post of
Chief Inspector of Factories were not matched by his successors, and it seems reasonable
to assume that the general administration of the Factories Act suffered accordingly.29 On
the other hand, the general state of the economy in the period 1903-25 made breaches of
the letter of the law less common than in the preceding decade.

Manufacturing, along with agricultural production and mining, led the slow recovery
from the depression of the 1890s. By the time the first Wages Boards sat down to fix
wage rates, recovery, although slowed by drought, was well under way.30

In the meantime, the previously divided colonial economies merged into a common
market with federation in 1901. No longer restricted by colonial tariff barriers, manufac¬
turing in Victoria expanded rapidly. This was particularly true of industries concerned
with metals and machinery, food processing, and clothing and textiles.31


-----

Manufacturing also benefited from certain structural changes in the Australian econ¬
omy in the early twentieth century. In particular, although pastoral commodities (meat
and wool) still dominated exports, agricultural products were assuming a greater share in
the export market.32 This diversification in the export trade assisted manufacturing, in
that wheat and dairy farmers tended to buy local goods rather than the imported ones
favoured by graziers. The smaller scale of farms also encouraged a higher demand for
locally-produced machinery.33 More directly, the expansion of agriculture led to the
expansion of those industries processing primary products, such as dairy produce and
flour-milling.34 City businessfolk thus continued to be almost as preoccupied with the
weather as farmers and graziers, and for the most part the climate was kind.35

Despite the 'growth' throughout most of this period, these were not years of dramatic
economic expansion comparable to those which preceded the 1890s depression.36 Aus¬
tralian manufacturing still suffered from a restricted local market and, in contrast to the
nineteenth century, population growth did not provide a ready remedy.37 Australian
manufacturers were therefore not in a position to benefit from the economies of scale
which resulted from a larger market. Distance was also a problem for Australian
exporters.38 Nor did the influx of capital approach the scale of overseas investment in the
1870s and 1880s, a factor which further limited economic expansion.39 In any event,
until the 1920s banks and stock exchanges continued to show little interest in manufac¬
turing, and retained earnings continued to be a major source of finance.40 Indeed, as
Cochrane suggests, the problems experienced by small-scale manufacturers in obtaining
capital might also have provided a check to Australia's industrial development before
World War II.41

A further limiting factor on the development of manufacturing was the nature of the
labour market, or to be more precise, labour markets. Although shortages of unskilled men
were almost unknown, this was not the case with either female labour or skilled male
labour. Where skilled adult males were concerned, shortages occurred partly because of
structural changes in the economy and partly because of deficiencies in the apprenticeship
and technical training systems.42 In the case of structural changes, the shortages were gen¬
erally brief, involving a period of adjustment to the changed situation.43 In the latter case,
the problem was of longer duration. It was not until the late 1920s that positive steps were
taken to ensure more effective industrial training of male workers.44

Shortages of female workers were, if the complaints of contemporaries are any indi¬
cation, even more serious. Seasonal shortages were common throughout this period, but
these were more acute in the decade prior to World War I and in the early 1920s.45 A
number of factors were involved in this shortage. Most importantly, there was a decline
in the percentage of unmarried women of working age seeking paid work, from 69.5 per
cent in 1901 to 50.1 per cent ten years later.46 It seems that with increased prosperity and
the extension of the secondary education system, parents were able to keep their daugh¬
ters either at home or at school for longer than in the economically depressed 1890s.47
Business colleges were also beginning to claim significant numbers of girls who other¬
wise would have been doing paid work.48 Manufacturing was particularly affected by
the lower percentage of girls in paid work, as it coincided with a growing preference for
office employment rather than factory work.49


-----

At the same time, the expansion of manufacturing, particularly in 'women's indus¬
tries', meant that the overall demand for female labour had increased.50 Of lesser import¬
ance but no doubt also a contributing factor was the fact that the minimum age at which
girls could legally enter factory employment was increased in 1909 from fourteen to fif¬
teen years.51 While this affected the numbers entering factory work, experienced workers
were reportedly lost to neighbouring states which 'poached' Victoria's skilled women.52

'Shortages' of women for factory work in the early 1920s had slightly different origins.
The paid work participation of single women had recovered to 65.3 per cent by 1921.
However, the trend toward white-collar work had gained momentum in the decade fol¬
lowing 1911. By 1921 the percentage of employed women engaged in commercial pur¬
suits had jumped to 15 per cent, compared to 11 per cent in 1911. (See Table 3.)
Professional employment (mainly teaching and nursing) showed similar increases.
Manufacturing showed a slight decline over the same period from 43.6 per cent to 42 per
cent, despite the increasing importance of manufacturing within the economy.53

The reasons for this shift are less certain. Higher wages were not the main consider¬
ation, especially given the extra cost of dressing appropriately for office, shop and school.
Probably more important was the perception of office and sales work as more 'ladylike'
or feminine than work in a factory.54 Girls may also have believed that such work would
bring them into contact with more eligible bachelors than would be found in factories.55
It is possible that girls were also affected by the backlash against the increase in women's
industrial employment. Fuelled by nationalist and imperialist concerns for the quality of
'the race', these denunciations intensified in the twentieth century.56

The fears of national efficiency advocates coincided with those of male (and some
female) unionists that women were taking men's jobs. These fears seemed to be sup¬
ported by statistics of industrial employment which showed a steady increase in the pro¬
portion of women compared to men in the workforce.57 That this increase was largely
due to the development of 'women's industries' rather than to female encroachment on
traditional male occupations was overlooked.58 The result was a hardening of union atti¬
tudes to female labour. From the turn of the century male unions took steps to exclude
women from a whole range of occupations, usually by the devices of protective legis¬
lation and equal pay. The unionists' success in securing government endorsement of
these strategies in key areas meant that women were increasingly confined to the lower-
status, more poorly paid occupations within manufacturing, a fact which can only have
made factory work less attractive.59 The failure of the Clerks' Union to secure equal pay
in this period meant that no such barrier existed to female entry into offices.60

That industrial unions were able to organise effectively to exclude women reflects the
changed situation from the turn of the century. Most importantly, the advent of Wages
Boards from 1897 and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court from 1904 raised the possi¬
bility of state intervention in the market place on behalf of the male worker. After the
turn of the century and the return of prosperity, Victorian unions began to reorganise.61
The visits of Tom Mann between 1903 and 1910 fuelled this revival.62 After 1907,
increasing disillusionment with the politics of the Australian Labor Party caused further
interest amongst the left-wing of labour circles in industrial organisation at both state
and federal levels.63

The campaign for equal pay received further impetus from the embryonic organisation
of women's unions in the few years prior to World War I. The interest in women's unions
at this time was partly due to the general interest in industrial unionism after 1907; the
THC's Organising Committee, for instance, devoted some of its energies to this end.64
Interest was also fuelled by the activities of left-wing feminists, who turned their atten¬
tion to women workers after the granting of the suffrage to Victorian women in 1908.65
Although operating from concern for economic justice for working women rather than
the defence of male jobs, women unionists also organised with equal pay as an objec¬
tive.66 That equal pay was not more widespread under the Wages Board system was
largely due to the reluctance of chairmen of boards and judges of the Court of Industrial
Appeals to decide a matter which, they argued, was the province of the legislature.67

Such was the context in which the clothing, boot and printing industries operated in
the early twentieth century. The exact periods covered varied with each industry. The
boot industry, for instance, was one of the earliest industries to resort to federal arbi¬
tration, obtaining an award in 1910. Thereafter the Wages Board system was of little
relevance. The clothing and printing trades did not approach the Commonwealth court
until after the war, in 1919 and 1925 respectively. For them, the Wages Boards were of
more enduring significance. Our focus now shifts to these individual industries, to an
examination of their different fates in this period.

 NO MORE AMAZONS: The Clothing Industries, 1897-1919

Work in the clothing trade during the era of the Wages Boards was shaped by the same
range of factors which affected the nineteenth-century industry. Product and labour mar¬
kets, available technologies, gender definitions, worker and employer organisation and
state action were all influential. But in the twentieth century the relative impact of these
factors changed markedly. Most importantly, developments at government level signifi¬
cantly altered the structures within which employers and workers operated. The feder¬
ation of the Australian colonies in 1901 opened up more extensive markets for Victorian
clothing; this increase in demand for goods affected the demand for labour and, in turn,
decisions employers made about the organisation of the labour process. Labour-saving
methods (mechanisation and speed-up) were adopted to cope with the need for rapid
output.

Employers' decisions were modified by the responses of workers, whose relative
power in the workplace increased with greater demand for labour. More importantly, the
advent of government wage-fixing bodies at both state and federal level created a more
favourable climate for collective worker organisation and gave unions in this industry the
opportunity to influence the nature of work in unprecedented ways.

In a less direct way, the federal government's commitment to the European war effort
in 1914-18 had repercussions for workers and their work. The war created the oppor¬
tunity both for more radical and militant responses on the part of workers and for a
powerful employer counteraction.

The state affected work in other ways. The granting of votes for women by the Com¬
monwealth in 1901 and the Victorian government in 1908 validated women's role in the
public sphere. Whereas the tailoresses in the 1880s and 1890s had sought the protection
of male sympathisers, in the twentieth century women unionists showed a new


-----

self-confidence and independence. But while this presented a challenge to both male
unionists and employers, it was limited in its impact by the strength of entrenched
gender ideology and the absence of any shift in the material base of the gender order.
Men continued to be the main 'breadwinners' and women continued to marry them and
leave the paid workforce for lengthy periods. Thus, while unionists had more oppor¬
tunity to influence the conditions and wages of work, much of their energy was devoted
to defending the position of male breadwinners (and their dependents) rather than to
separate economic justice for women. And Wages Boards were not inclined to grant such
economic justice as long as the independent woman could be dismissed as atypical.

The 1896 Act had a major impact on the nature of work in the clothing industry. The
early Wages Board determinations, which set piece rates in most cases at a slightly higher
rate than the weekly wage, encouraged employers to move their production away from
outworkers (who had to be paid by the piece) and into factories where they could pay by
the week.1 With the cost of outwork increased, mechanisation, used in conjunction with
a weekly wage or task system (or flexible piece rates in the case of the shirt industry)
became relatively more profitable. Thus, Ellen Eckersall, a clothing and shirt manufac¬
turer, explained that since the Act outwork was relatively more expensive because inside
the factories operations such as buttonholing were done by machine. 'Of course', she
added, 'girls have had to work harder for their money than before the Act was
introduced.'2

The determinations of the various Wages Boards thus represented for employers a new
crisis of valorisation. No longer able to cheapen production by cutting outwork rates,
they had to devise new strategies to remain competitive. The combination of machinery,
subdivision and weekly wages was adopted to varying degrees in all branches of the
industry. Whereas piece rates specified a direct relationship between the quantity of
work performed and the payment for such labour, weekly wages did not. Providing they
paid the specified amount for the time worked, there was no legal limit to the quantity of
work (or task) employers could demand of their workers. As one worker put it, the task
system was really 'piece work at a reduced rate. It is cheap labour. It is evading the Act.'3
This intensification of work was facilitated by greater subdivision of garment-making
and by the introduction of new machinery and the application of gas and electric power
to drive these machines. As a general indication of this trend, the amount of horsepower
applied to clothing machinery in Victorian factories tripled in the first decade of the
twentieth century. (See Appendix, Table A6.)

The transition to factory production had implications for the age and sex structure of
the workforce as well as for the work process. In the tailoring section of the industry, fac¬
tory production was accompanied by the employment of an increasing proportion of
female and juvenile labour. The new methods, requiring less training than the old, made
the employment of such relatively inexperienced labour more viable. The increasing
employment of juveniles was especially marked in the period between 1903 and 1910
when legal limitations on the employment of young workers were removed. The pro¬
portion of female juniors (under twenty-one years of age) in clothing factories rose from
28.7 per cent in 1902 to 38.6 per cent in 1906.4 The increasing employment of adult


-----

women in tailoring is not so dramatically illustrated by the statistics: men were not so
much being displaced as relocated into supervisory and managerial positions within the
factory system.5 In the traditionally female sections of the industry (dressmaking, mil¬
linery) the process was one of masculinisation rather than feminisation. The advent of
the male entrepreneur in these sections contributed to this trend, with the rate of increase
of men engaged in dressmaking and millinery increasing at about three times the rate of
increase for women during the period before World War I. (See Appendix, Table A6.)

But while the provisions of the various Wages Board determinations prompted
employers to adopt different production strategies, they also placed limits on their
alternatives. Limitations on the proportions of juveniles which could be employed
restricted the use of such labour in the tailoring section, with the exception of the years
between 1903 and 1910 when all such restrictions were lifted. Similarly, the 1909 pro¬
vision for equal pay for the sexes engaged on pressing and cutting effectively checked the
gradually increasing trend to employ women in these occupations.

It would be misleading, however, to attribute too much to the provisions of the Wages
Boards. The boards certainly initiated the dramatic transitions of the turn of the century, but
changes in the product market for clothing at this time fuelled the process. Most import¬
antly, the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901 opened the rest of Australia to Vic¬
torian manufactures by removing all tariff barriers between the states. Firms in all sections
of the industry installed new machinery in order to keep pace with the increased demand.
This was especially important for the underclothing and whitework section, which
accounted for most of the large increase in the export of wearing apparel in the five years
following federation.6 And once the trend toward factory production was established, it
became self-sustaining. Cheaper production methods led to cheaper goods which in turn
increased the demand for factory-made products. Within a decade the purchase of ready¬
made underwear had been established as the norm in Australian households, and the
homemade article increasingly became a Victorian anachronism.7 Changing fashions also
contributed to the adoption of new methods of manufacture. Again, whitework serves as a
good illustration. Exquisite underwear became fashionable in the late 1890s, when it was
considered refined to have yards of delicate finery concealed beneath the rather severe tail¬
ored fashions of that decade. Manufacturers were quick to supply this market, experiment¬
ing with special machines for embroidering and adapting ordinary sewers to cope with
more complex tasks. The fashion for straw hats likewise created a market for a new product
which was well suited to mechanised factory production.8

In the dressmaking section, the popularity of the blouse and skirt from the turn of the
century eroded the prejudice against ready-made dresses which had retarded factory
production in the nineteenth century. One of the biggest problems with ready-made
clothing was that it was often ill-fitting. Loose-fitting blouses worn with circular or
gored skirts fitted a far greater variety of figure-types than the less flexible all-in-one
dress. And as with whitework, the effect on output was self-sustaining, since increased
demand enabled greater economies in production, which led to cheaper goods, thus
further stimulating the popularity of the ready-made item in comparison to the order or
homemade article. The expansion in output also helped overcome the other drawback of
factory-made clothes: their lack of individuality.


-----

Ready-made clothing for men had gained much earlier acceptance, largely because
it was less varied in style. A relatively standard product also lent itself to greater sub¬
division. This feature of the product market for men's clothing was exaggerated during
World War I, when many tailoring firms became involved in the production of military
clothing. A guaranteed market and a standard product encouraged firms to adopt mass
production techniques, with factories such as the Commonwealth Clothing Factory
installing cutting and pressing machines, new patent sewing machines and in many
cases adopting further subdivision of the labour process.

It should be stressed, however, that these changes applied very unevenly across the
clothing trades. They applied to men's clothing more than to women's, and to the making
of shirts and underclothing more than to outer garments. The order trade, in both men's
and women's clothes, was largely untouched by the new methods and machines.
Whereas the market for ready-made clothing expanded, with dramatic consequences for
methods of production, the market for order goods was at best stagnant. This was
especially true of men's order tailoring, so much so that by the end of this period the
Australasian Manufacturer noted that 'the majority of men no longer wear anything indi¬
vidually manufactured for them'.9 Handwork and treadle machines were still dominant
throughout the order trade. The newfangled finishing machines were of little use in this
section because their performance still did not match the hand-stitching of skilled
workers. Similarly, powered sewing machines were of little value when precision
mattered more than pace. Cutting machines and even knives were inappropriate to the
cutting of individual garments. Similarly, the order garment-maker's product was too
varied to make much use of subdivision. Nor could employers speed up their workers
using tasks and weekly wages, since the order trade was so erratic that they would have
found themselves paying workers to sit idle for unknown periods of time in between
busy periods.

The supply of labour also limited the extent to which manufacturers could cheapen
production by using female and juvenile labour. The labour of women and girls was by
no means an unlimited commodity, and clothing manufacturers constantlv complained
of the difficulty in obtaining suitable labour. This was particularly so in the years 1905—
10, and throughout most of the war years.10

Wages Board determinations, product markets and the supply of labour thus all affec¬
ted the nature of work in this period. Other, less impersonal, factors were also important
in both generating and limiting change. The agency of employers and workers, acting
either individually or collectively, was often decisive in determining whether or not cer¬
tain practices were adopted or rejected.

Not surprisingly, it was employers in the shirt and underclothing sections who were
the most innovative. Edward Price, managing director of E. Lucas and Company of
Ballarat, travelled to Europe and America in 1909 in order to study the latest trends in
factory organisation: he absorbed the current ideas on assembly lines and mass pro¬
duction which were then applied to the Lucas factory in modified form.11 James Law,
managing director of the Richmond Pelaco factory, obtained his inspiration from books
rather than first-hand observation. A self-styled 'New Industrialist', he began his
scheme for a 'scientifically managed factory' in 1911. According to his own account, he


-----

got 'the germ of his ideas from reading Frederick Winslow Taylor's book on "Shop
Management" '.12 Law hastened to add, however, that it was the inspiration only which
came from Taylor: the details of his factory organisation were worked out by a process of
interaction between the general principles and Australian conditions. Indeed, although
Law was fond of promoting the novelty of his system, it is clear that most of his methods
regarding work processes were merely refinements of existing practices in Melbourne's
other large shirt and collar factories. Other ideas derived not so much from Taylor's
inspiration as from the application of Henry Ford's assembly-line techniques to the
manufacture of garments. His methods were certainly 'old-fashioned' compared to what
was being done in modern American factories.13

Nevertheless, Law was on the road to a more thorough-going system of scientific man¬
agement, but he was still feeling his way during this period for there are indications that
he was experimenting with more dramatic changes. His time-and-motion studies built
up a groundwork of information from which more revolutionary strategies could be
devised. He experimented with the length of work-periods in order to arrive at the opti¬
mum length of the working day. Also in Taylorist vein, his reorganisation of the process
of laundering the finished product showed a practical determination to standardise work
processes, wherever possible replacing 'rule of thumb' practices. It is clear that this
entailed separation between conception and execution. Law also took steps to eliminate
as much human labour as possible, replacing it where practicable with machinery. In this,
however, he was limited by the existing state of technology. Much of the sewing still had
to be finished by hand, as the machines were not available to do the work as well as
people. Similarly, although electric cutting machines were available from about 1910,
these were not sufficiently accurate to suit the better-quality shirt trade.

Apart from the assembly-line sewing process, there is also other evidence that Law
was influenced by Fordist ideas. His early adoption of a limited number of standard
products is one example. Where Henry Ford concentrated on the T Model automobile,
James Law produced twelve types of collars, in contrast to the 197 styles formerly pro¬
duced by the Pearson, Law Company (Pelaco's ancestor) and its contemporaries.
Like Ford, Law also placed great stress on finding the right person for the job, and by his
own report had to wait three years to find two girls capable of performing a certain oper¬
ation on wing-collars in the same way as one particularly highly productive worker
already in his employ. Like Ford, he also advocated the payment of high wages if the
worker was efficient and productive. Finally, Law's style of management was in many
ways reminiscent of Ford's intrusive, paternalistic methods of industrial relations.

Although employers like Price and Law were keen to acquire new ideas and experi¬
ment within their own firms, other employers were more conservative. Many were sus¬
picious of what they regarded merely as an 'American fad'. Nor was this difference
simply a matter of individual personality or whim: shirt and whitework manufacturers,
who came to their positions as entrepreneurs rather than craftsmen, were more prepared
to innovate than employers in the tailoring section who more often had served appren¬
ticeships in the trade.

Workers, acting either individually or collectively, also influenced the timing and
direction of changes in the workplace. James Law, for instance, stated that 'one of the


-----

reasons there has not been so much new machinery and new ideas is that we have not
had the co-operation of labour'. When trying his innovations at Pelaco he 'found a great
deal of opposition in many branches of our factory'. That this should have been so was
perhaps to be expected, considering that Law stated that he introduced the new methods
in response to limitation of output on the part of the cutters. Opposition from workers
thus delayed Law's schemes until he eventually sacked his recalcitrant workers and
replaced them with more compliant ones.14

The Clothing Trades Union also resisted the introduction of the team system into order
shops, mainly because it saw the subdivision of labour as a prerequisite for the unlimited
entry of female workers into tailors' jobs. The union's decision in 1909 to abandon equal
pay for women doing tailoring in 'legitimate' shops if it meant encouraging the team
system is a clear example of this perspective: the male unionists saw the team system as
an even greater incentive to employ female labour than cheaper rates for women.15 Few
women devoted enough time to the trade to acquire the all-round skills possessed by
first-class tailors; subdivided work entailed in the team system, by contrast, offered
opportunities to more quickly trained labour.

It seems, however, that there was no consistent worker objection to deskilling as a
matter of principle. It was rather the consequences of such subdivision for overall pay
rates and employment opportunities that mattered. For example, in 1900 a meeting of
shirt and collar workers protested against what was essentially a reintegration of the
work process. With the move to factory production in preference to outwork, factory
machinists were often required to do the finishing as well as the machining, thus
displacing those women who had previously done finishing exclusively. Their protest
encouraged firms to install special machines for finishers to operate.16 The issue in this
case was very clearly exploitation rather than job control.

This primary concern with exploitation was also endorsed at an official level within
the union. As Carter told the 1919 arbitration hearing, 'the members of the claimant
Union care not how the work is subdivided if there [sic] wages are not affected thereby or
their employment'.17 Rather than resisting subdivision within the ready-made factories
on the grounds that it deskilled operatives, the union argued that the workers became
more skilled on each separate operation and therefore deserved additional monetary
reward.18 Subdivided work, the union argued, should be seen as specialised rather than
fragmented.

Unionists' campaigns against 'sweating' also led them to support large factories rather
than smaller workrooms. This implied an acceptance of 'modern methods'. The union's
success in having outdoor piece rates set at a higher rate than those inside tailoring firms
led, as we have seen, to a concentration of work in large factories.

Alf Wallis, Clothing Trades Union organiser, carried this policy even further. He
argued that shorter hours for the industry were a good thing because they would encour¬
age greater 'efficiency' on the part of manufacturers. He spoke of the 44-hour week,
encouraging employers to adopt 'good methods'. There was no doubt what he meant by
'good methods': he referred to Taylor's works on the subject of the division of labour as
a guide for those employers who needed instruction.19 The union hoped that if it sup¬
ported new methods, workers would share in the increased productivity by receiving


-----

higher wages, shorter hours and better conditions. A similar hope was expressed by the
treasurer of the Laundry Workers' Union, Miss Rees, a forewoman at Pelaco. At a
Christmas party in 1913 she referred to the increase in wages received during the year
and 'hoped that with the introduction of the latest improved machinery which their firm
proposed to introduce, that a still further advance would be made by the women
workers'.20 Indeed, Law encouraged the belief that any improvements in the lot of shirt
workers were due 'mainly to the change in the method of making'.21 In one sense Law
was right, in that the newer methods were more profitable. However, employers did not
automatically pass on the increased profits to workers in the form of higher wages. On
the contrary, whatever benefits workers received had been fought for. This is very clearly
illustrated by the fact that the Shirt Wages Board (on which Law was an employer del¬
egate) prescribed one of the lowest minimum wages despite the more 'advanced'
methods which were general in this industry. The CTU recognised that such was the case
and organised to extract 'their share' of the benefits from the employers.

Unionists also hoped that more 'efficient' methods would lead not only to increased
productivity and profitability, but would also relieve workers of oppressive manual
effort. Carter stated that 'the union will always welcome efficiency on the job, and if they
can produce without over-exerting themselves, then I say it is a good thing for the coun¬
try, and a good thing for the unions, ... and this union is not likely to obstruct the sub¬
division of labour'.22 Apart from official union policy, workers also encouraged changes
in manufacturing methods in more informal ways. In the case of power sewing
machines, one employer claimed that when they were first introduced 'many factories
who could not afford to keep up with the times just dropped out of the trade because
workers would go to work for the factories that had the power machines to get away
from the treadle'.23 With workers paid by results, whether by piece rates or the task
system, anything which enabled them to work faster and expend less energy was obvi¬
ously attractive. An advertisement which appeared regularly in the Tocsin appealed
explicitly to the clothing worker's need to produce at speed, although in this case the
machine was a new-model treadle:

One remedy against sweating lies in the use of up-to-date machines in trades where the mechanical is
an essential element. White-workers particularly are subject to this principle, and they will thank

J. W. Johnston and Co., of 222 Swanston-street, for his Standard Rotary Shuttle Sewing Machine. Its
speed is six-stitches to one revolution of the stand wheel, and thus enables the worker to earn a maxi¬
mum of wage with a minimum of exertion.24

Closer experience of powered appliances made some workers less enthusiastic. Mrs Ellen
Eckersall, the proprietor of a large shirt factory, reported that she had had 'girls give up
the work because of the noise of the machines'. Workers found that, although the
treadles were physically more arduous, they placed less stress on one's nerves.25 How¬
ever, as the pressure to produce at speed remained, most stayed with the powered
models.

The increasing trend for factories to work the forty-eight hours in five days instead of
six was also partly a result of individual workers expressing their preference by 'voting
with their feet'. Certainly it suited employers, who found that workers did not settle


-----

down to work as well on a Saturday morning, but it also suited many workers, especially
women and girls, who found Saturday mornings useful for doing domestic chores. It also
gave them two whole days away from the factory.26

Workers also resisted new methods when they were found to be inconvenient. May
Francis records how her objection as a matter of principle to the use of time machines at
Craig Williamson's in 1911 initially received little support from the other workers. It was
only when they found that the extra time taken to clock off caused some to miss trams
and trains that the majority simply refused to co-operate with the innovation and the
clocks were abandoned by management.27

As in the nineteenth century, workers could influence methods of production
indirectly through their passivity as well as through their protests. The low wages set by
the early boards in dressmaking, millinery, shirts and whitework were largely the result
of poor worker organisation in these sections. Such relatively low wages made certain
kinds of mechanisation less attractive than in tailoring. One large shirt manufac¬
turer reported that she 'never found double-felling machines a success' because
'these machines cost us so much'. With labour still so cheap it was more profitable to
keep using the more labour-intensive method associated with the older, cheaper
machinery.28

As this instance suggests, the relative bargaining power of workers and employers
influenced the work process by affecting the price of labour. Industrial relations also
affected other crucial factors which influenced the profitability of different production
methods: the number of juveniles working in the industry; the types of work open to
cheaper female labour; and the hours of work. The 1896 Act changed the framework
within which these factors were determined, shifting the decision-making arena away
from the shop floor to the Wages Board. And whereas any collective agreements prior to
the Act were enforced by the parties to the agreement, in the twentieth century the Fac¬
tories Office performed this function and intervened in other ways in the relationship
between capital and labour.

In general, the Wages Board system tended to magnify divisions between employers
and to minimise those which divided workers. The necessity to nominate delegates
encouraged union organisation. Where unions controlled the selection of delegates, the
employees were assured of united representation. Employers were much less united and
the importance of board decisions for the trade as a whole made such divisions more
serious than in the days before the boards were established.

As in the nineteenth century, different methods of production and different styles of
organisation divided employers as a group and provided the scope for strategic alliances
between some employers and the unions. The biggest division on the Clothing Board
occurred in 1898 between the delegates representing the 500 or so order tailors and those
representing the 30 ready-made factories. The manufacturers were outraged when an
order tailor (employer) on the board voted with the workers to raise the wages of female
labour by 25 per cent so as to reduce the advantage to the ready-made factories, which
relied so heavily on cheaper women workers. As Barnet Sniders, a wholesale clothier,
put it, 'the interests of the retail [order] tailors are totally opposed to the wholesale

[ready-made] traders'.29


-----

There were also divisions within the order trade between those employers who used
traditional methods and those who adopted subdivision. Carter explained to the Chief
Inspector of Factories, Murphy, that 'it is not the usage or custom of reputable employers'
to employ the team system on order work. 'Many employers are in favour of some regu¬
lation of the mode of manufacture as a protection to legitimate order trade.'30 He went on
to add that such employers were interested in working with the union to prevent inno¬
vations in work processes.

Some employers also worked with male unionists on the question of limiting or
excluding female employment. This operated at both the formal level of devising Wages
Board determinations and at the informal level of workplace practices and policies. As
one employer explained to the Arbitration Court in 1919:

Certainly one of the witnesses told us of three Amazons, who were employed somewhere and who
did the work [of pressing] with equal efficiency to men but the foreman there decided he would not
have any more Amazons. We are with the Union there, we do not want them, we do not want to use
them, or see them employed .. ,31

A different sort of division along gender lines occurred on the Underclothing Board in
1917, when the two male delegates were incensed at their colleague, Mrs Edith Oliver,
voting with the workers. The reason here seems to have been sympathy on the part of
Oliver for her fellow women. Although there is evidence of this sentiment within indi¬
vidual firms, as with other divisions between employers, within the context of the Wages
Boards this kind of sex solidarity had more profound ramifications.32

The effect of the Wages Board system on workers was quite the reverse, encouraging
unity rather than division. In the predominantly female branches of the industry, the
creation of Wages Boards between 1897 and 1907 to cover these sections sparked off a
number of new unions.33 These were largely the result of an energetic organising cam¬
paign by a handful of committed socialist-feminists. Some of the women involved, such
as Mrs Minnie Felstead and Miss Ellen Mulcahy, were middle-class feminists with
working-class sympathies. Others—such as Mrs Maria Stellner, Mrs Sarah Muir, Miss
Minnie Webber and Mrs M. M. Powell—were working-class women, whose industrial
agitation grew out of their own experiences as workers in the sewing trades.34

Although the existence of Wages Boards fostered the creation of unions, it could not
make up for the inherent problems in organising workers in the women's sections. These
unions struggled from the outset. Small memberships could not finance paid organisers,
and without paid organisers recruitment was slow. The dressmakers and milliners were
the hardest to organise, the majority still working in small establishments with preten¬
sions to 'gentility'. (See Table 4.) As one long-time unionist who started work in 1909
recalled, 'in the early days half the girls used to think that if you belonged to the Union
you were lowering yourself'.35 Wallis singled out millinery workers in particular as dis¬
playing 'a surfeit of apathy' about their wages and conditions.36 Factory Inspector Mar¬
garet Cuthbertson agreed with his assessment and thought it applied to dressmakers as
well. The reason for this apathy was, she believed, the fact that 'so many girls ... take it
up not with the idea of earning a living but because they do not like housework'. Conse¬
quently, they were happy with 'seven or eight shillings a week for pocket money'.37

The union really only existed in the few ready-made firms, which meant that stock
workers dominated workers' delegates on the Wages Boards despite their smaller num¬
bers in comparison with workers from order firms.38

The growth of large shirt and whitework factories made organisation in these sections
potentially easier, but here the union encountered other problems. The most serious of
these was the 'new paternalism' which accompanied the 'new industrialism' of men like
Edward Price (Lucas and Co.) and James Law (Pelaco). Law, for instance, believed that
'scientific principles' were just as applicable to industrial relations as they were to the
manufacture of shirts. He saw strikes as symptomatic of bad management. He argued
that 'we handle this labour problem in a very unscientific manner'.39 Not only were
strikes wasteful, but they indicated the existence of a basic mistrust between capital and
labour which was also expressed in worker opposition to new methods of work. He
believed it was essential to 'sweep away' the 'bitter hatred and mistrust that exists
between employers and their employees' before 'Industrial Efficiency' could be achieved.

According to Law, the first step toward industrial harmony was greater intimacy
between bosses and workers. Working on the assumption that it was easier to hate a
stranger, he urged employers to take steps to get to know their employees better by meet¬
ing them in conference, finding out their grievances and acting on them. At the Pelaco
factory, monthly meetings were held on Thursday evenings (outside working hours) and
were attended by employees in groups of forty or less. On such occasions Law
expounded his industrial philosophy, offering high wages and good conditions in
exchange for the workers' co-operation. Lest one mistake this concern with phil¬
anthropy, Law was quick to deny the suggestion. As he said, 'the benefit to us has been
great. Our production cost has come down, our trade has expanded, and our profits have
increased.'40 He went on to explain the more subtle benefits of his scheme, admittedly
with some exaggeration:

We have at the present moment a very happy and contented staff. Altogether about 500 hands are
employed in the business—the majority being girls. We have never had a strike, and we have never
had any slowing down of work. Our employees are producing more and more, and they are happy as
the day is long.41

There was little room for unionism in this cosy scheme.

Organising tailoring workers was less daunting. At the time the first Wages Boards
were appointed in 1897, there were already a number of unions covering the tailoring
trade. Three unions were exclusively male: the Tailors' Protection Society, the Cutters'
and Trimmers' Union and the Pressers' Union. Women were catered for by the old


-----

Victorian Tailoresses' Union, covering stock workers, and the newer union, originating in
Ballarat in 1890, which covered the order hands. Although all five unions had dis¬
integrated to varying degrees during the depression, the passing of the 1896 Act was a
spur to renewed organisation. The necessity of electing workers' delegates and choosing
chairmen for the Wages Board gave the unions a new purpose to which they responded
eagerly.42 By the end of 1899 the Tailors' Society had become so strong that it negotiated

a 25 per cent increase on the log rates in the city's major tailoring firms. By the following
year the society was organising in country towns.43

The creation of Wages Boards also encouraged co-operation between the different sec¬
tional unions: the Act specified a total number of five workers' representatives, but it did
not differentiate between the various job categories in allocating delegates. If the workers
were to avoid elections, it was essential that they co-operate to ensure that no more than
five candidates were nominated. Political expediency overrode sectional rivalries, and
within a decade all of the unions had amalgamated to form the Victorian branch of the
Federated Clothing Trades Union.44

But although sectional loyalties were relinquished, gender hostility was not. Herbert
Carter, union secretary from 1907 to 1925, recalled the attitude of these early male
unionists: 'To my own definite knowledge I know that male representatives on these Tri¬
bunals [wages boards] deliberately refrained from using their best endeavours to improve
the lot of the women mainly on account of sex jealousy in relation to industry.'45

The amalgamation of the sectional unions in tailoring in 1907 institutionalised the
divisions between men and women. The executive committee comprised two representa¬
tives from each section: tailors, tailoresses, pressers and cutters. As women were eligible
to represent only the tailoresses, men were in a clear majority throughout the formative
years of the Clothing Trades Union. The union's direction in these early years (1907-15)
expressed the masculine preoccupation with excluding women. In 1909 the union made
a comprehensive effort to obtain equal pay on all 'male' jobs, that is, cutting, pressing
and order coat-making. The trade-off for the employers was to be no rise in the weekly
wage of the stock tailoresses, and an increase of only one shilling and sixpence in the rate
paid to order tailoresses (other than coat-hands).46 The employers were co-operative.
Equal pay would make little difference to their wages bill for pressing and cutting, as so
few women were engaged on these jobs. The proportion of women making men's order
coats was also small compared to the numbers engaged on trousers and vests and in the
stock trade. The equal pay provision would have been passed in its entirety had it not
been for a technical problem arising out of one or two firms adopting different methods
of manufacture to the rest of the 'legitimate' order tailors. As it was, the men succeeded
in having equal pay awarded for both cutting and pressing, and thus effectively stopped
the inroads women had begun to make on these occupations in the early years of the
twentieth century. It is extremely unlikely that this would have occurred without the
Wages Board system to enforce the agreement reached by representatives of employers
and workers.

While the Wages Board system reinforced the power of men relative to women in the
industry, it also allowed a disproportionate influence to militant and determined
workers. This was especially the case in the under-unionised dressmaking, whitework


-----

and shirtmaking sections. Without a Wages Board, the efforts of women such as Mrs
Margaret Powell, Miss Lesbia Keogh and Miss May Francis would have probably been
ineffective in raising general wage levels because of the problems associated with thor¬
oughly organising these industries. As Wages Board delegates, however, they could win
improvements regardless of the commitment of their fellow-workers. On the Under¬
clothing Board, for example, the employees, led by May Francis, succeeded in raising the
minimum rate by 50 per cent to thirty shillings per week for female machinists. This was
higher than any other clothing board determination at the time. For the first time male
cutters were provided for and their minimum rate was also higher than cutters in other
sections. (See Appendix, Table A7.) They also succeeded in reversing the permitted pro¬
portion of juveniles to adult workers, which had been unchanged since the first determi¬
nation in 1899. Thus, instead of two juveniles to every journeywoman, the 1917
determination specified a limit of one juvenile to every two adults employed. In an
industry which was 'essentially a girls' trade', this was a significant alteration. Even
though the employers' approach to the Court of Industrial Appeals succeeded in increas¬
ing the ratio to 3:2, the new-style unionists had nonetheless upset the status quo, and
shaken the employers' hitherto easy domination of their employees.47

But while the Wages Boards gave more opportunities to strong worker delegates, there
is a sense in which they reinforced the powerlessness of the weak. Obtaining suitable
delegates had always been a problem for the poorly unionised women's sections,
especially as the workers' delegates were almost always women sitting down to bargain
with, in most cases, a male-dominated group of employers and a male chairperson.48 As
May Francis, workers' representative on the Underclothing Board, recalled: 'My col¬
leagues always seemed tonguetied in the presence of the employers . .. ',49

The popularity of police magistrates as board chairmen further intimidated female
workers, especially when they were of the same type as Notley Moore, who had a repu¬
tation for telling 'smutty stories'.50 The behaviour of some of these chairmen on the boards
did little to put the workers at their ease. Francis Reddin, chairman of the Dressmakers
Board in 1911, 'sat back in his chair laughing' at the union's claim for an increase in the
minimum wage to thirty shillings, and refused to discuss the wages, saying £l per week
was enough for any woman.51 It required a particularly confident and determined sort of
delegate to cope with such behaviour, and unfortunately many were 'unfit'.52

With such pressures on delegates, the early Wages Boards for these sections awarded
wages considerably below those in the tailoring trade. (See Appendix, Table A7.) As Ord
remarked regarding the first determination of the Shirtmakers Board: 'It seems to me to
speak volumes for the reasonableness of the employes when such a minimum [16 shillings]
for work requiring a considerable amount of skill is accepted.'53 Abraham Davis, clothing
manufacturer of North Melbourne, also blamed the poor quality of the employees' dele¬
gates on the Wages Boards for the low minimums in the women's sections: 'It seems that
the better representatives the employes get, they better can fight their battle; for instance,
there is skilled work required in white work as there is in clothing, yet the white-workers
have fixed the minimum at 15s and the clothing [i.e. tailoring] at 20s.'54

Dressmakers, particularly those in the order trade, were the most poorly rewarded for
their skill. The women themselves complained of the injustice, and the factory inspectors


-----

certainly agreed that the disparity bore no relation to any objective notions of the skill
involved.55 Not until 1911 was the minimum wage for dressmakers raised above 16 shil¬
lings per week. On this occasion the rate was set at 21s. 6d. This was still lower than any
other clothing board minimum except underclothing (whitework). (See Appendix, Table
A7.) However, that the workers were successful in gaining even this advance was a
tribute to the intervention of the revived Dressmakers' Union. The union secre¬
tary, Mrs Minnie Felstead, took great care to select representatives who would be pre¬
pared to fight for a higher rate, but as mentioned the delegates faced derision from the
chairman, Reddin.56

The strength and unity of the workers' delegates on the 1911 Dress Board was, how¬
ever, atypical of the dress, shirt, whitework and millinery sections. More commonly,
early Wages Board delegates lacked the discipline necessary to carry through their
demands. The shirtmakers, for instance, lost their claim for a 35-shilling minimum for
laundry workers because one of the workers refused to cast her vote either way.57

Even when competent representatives could be found, their intermittent work pat¬
terns, especially if engaged in outwork, could render them ineligible to sit. Wages Board
delegates also risked being sacked by unsympathetic employers, the unions being power¬
less to resist such victimisation. This further discouraged workers, many of whom were
said to be apathetic to begin with.58 The amalgamation of the women's unions with the
Clothing Trades Union during the war helped overcome some of these problems by
bringing more disciplined and outspoken delegates to represent the workers on the
boards. Although paid union officials were expressly debarred from sitting, they exer¬
cised their influence indirectly. As Francis recalled, 'the Union officials assisted us to
understand what was required of us'. The delegates were coached in the best way to put
together a case, and witnesses were selected who would support them most effectively.59
In the case of the Milliners' Board, concerted action by the union thwarted a move by
employers to have their own candidates returned.60

Thus, while the Wages Board system provided little protection for workers who as a
group were industrially passive, it magnified the effect of any kind of militancy or organ¬
isation, even though this was by a minority of workers. This has been clearly shown in
the case of the poorly unionised women's sections of dressmaking, millinery, and under¬
clothing and whitework. Even in tailoring, where unions were well established, there
were groups of workers who remained beyond the union's grasp. But whereas before the
establishment of the Wages Boards the existence of non-union outworkers thwarted the
efforts of unionists to raise wages, under the board system it was possible to set mini¬
mum rates for all workers.

The creation of Wages Boards thus influenced the agreements reached between labour
and capital, and in giving more power to assertive workers changed the nature of
employer-employee relations. Lewis Cohen, clothing manufacturer, complained that 'We
used to be always happy, but now it simply amounts to this, on the one side—"I will get
from you all I can" and on the other—"I will give you as little as I can in return".'61
Certainly, the existence of such a tribunal encouraged workers to protest against con¬
ditions to which they might otherwise have acquiesced, although many were still reluc¬
tant to complain because of well-grounded fears of victimisation.62 On the other hand,


-----

the boards provided a forum for settling disputes between workers and bosses which
might otherwise have erupted into strikes.63 The increasing disillusionment with the
Wages Boards after 1909 fuelled the rising level of militancy within the union, particu¬
larly during the war years. As Alf Wallis urged union members in 1915, they must
'realize that they would never get justice from the Wages Board, they must fight the
employing class by direct action for any real advantage'. The union was not, however,
persuaded to abandon state tribunals altogether, transferring its hopes instead to the fed¬
eral Arbitration Court.64

While the machinery of the Wages Boards structured workplace relations, the activities
of the staff of the Factories Office also affected these relationships. Individual officers
exercised considerable influence over board proceedings. This was particularly so in the
case of the women's sections (dresses, millinery, shirts and whitework) where the inspec¬
tors sometimes played a key role in the appointment of workers' representatives. The
elections to the Whiteworkers' Board in 1910 and 1911 are a clear instance of factory
inspectors intervening in proceedings to ensure that 'milk-and-water people', 'too fright¬
ened to say anything to the other side of the table' were returned, rather than the more
militant nominees of the Whiteworkers' Union.65

The Victorian Factories Office and the Wages Boards which it administered were not
the only state influences on industrial relations in this era. The state also played a direct
role in the clothing trade in its capacity as employer. The letting of government contracts
for post office and military uniforms at cheap rates had always attracted bitter criticism
of the Victorian government from trade unionists. As Sarah Muir, Wages Board delegate
and tailoress, put it, governments were 'the greatest sweaters in existence—they always
have been in the clothing trade'.66 The example of New South Wales in setting up a state
clothing factory in 1904 to handle government contracts was followed by the Fisher fed¬
eral Labor government in 1910. The new Commonwealth Clothing Factory which
opened its doors in South Melbourne in 1911 was intended by its founders to be a model
of both efficiency and employer justice.67 Shortly after its opening. Labor Call reported
that 'the comfort of the girls [sic] working in this establishment is so well attended to that
it reminded one more of a girls' sewing class in school than a factory'.68 Certainly the
regulations issued by the federal Cabinet were models for the time. They provided for
two weeks' annual leave plus all federal and state holidays on full pay; sick leave on
full pay; and time and a half for all work over forty-eight hours per week. A factory
medical officer was provided, as well as dining rooms supplying cheap midday meals.
The rooms were cooled in summer by electric fans and heated by steam radiators in win¬
ter. Lighting was supplied by electric lights, 'painted a pleasing shade of green', and
special emergency buttons cut the power to machines at the first sign of accidents.69

From the outset, however, the desire of the factory's founders to provide a model for
other clothing factories conflicted with the desire to show that such conditions were
possible even for firms competing on the open market. This created friction from the
very beginning between the manager, Mr Slade, and the workers over rates of pay and
task levels. Ironically, the conflicts which ensued between the Defence Department and
the Clothing Trades Union over the Commonwealth Clothing Factory (CCF) were more
bitter than any previous dispute between workers and capitalists.70


-----

The federal government also affected industrial relations in less direct ways. The exist¬
ence of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration after 1904 provided
an alternative forum for collective bargaining which had ramifications on worker organ¬
isation in the clothing industry. The defeat of the union's claim for equal pay on the
making of order frock-coats on the 1909 Wages Board provided the immediate impulse
for an organisational drive aimed at taking a case to the federal court. It was not just that
the union hoped for a more favourable hearing but that it recognised that one of the
major obstacles to equal pay in Victoria had been the fear of interstate competition. The
only way around this difficulty, the union reasoned, was to obtain a federal award appli¬
cable to manufacturers in every state.71 So in 1910 the Victorian branch embarked on an
energetic effort to organise the other states in order to apply to the Commonwealth Court
of Conciliation and Arbitration. Herbert Carter, Victorian secretary, also secretary of the
federated union, carried on a relentless campaign to persuade the other states of the
virtues of the Victorian scheme.72 Since it was the tailors who stood to gain most from a
federal award, they took a leading part in the union's organisation. As Alf Wallis
remarked in 1925, 'the tailors influence was in the past years greater than the pressers or
cutters. [The] tailors [were] frightened of [the] females ... 'P

As part of this preparation for the federal case, the union started organising women
workers with unprecedented enthusiasm.74 Drawing on the talents and energies of
Melbourne's small band of socialist feminists, the union appointed first Miss Ellen
Mulcahy and then a Miss Mantach as paid women's organisers on a temporary basis.75 It
also gave enthusiastic support to the Trades Hall Council's Organising Committee in its
efforts to organise women between 1907 and 1914, and, more controversially, to the
equal pay campaigns organised in conjunction with Vida Goldstein's Women's Political
Association.76

Until 1915, however, the Clothing Trades Union had made no attempt to organise
non-tailoring garment workers. With the outbreak of war in 1914, the union was forced
to reconsider its priorities. A new generation of women unionists, more radical than most
of its predecessors, demanded that the union adopt a more industrial style in place of its
old craft exclusivism. One of the most prominent was May Francis, the daughter of Irish
Fenians, who came to socialism via Vida Goldstein's feminism. As secretary to the Mili¬
tant Propagandists of the Labor Movement, she took an active part in the anti¬
conscription campaigns of 1916 and 1917. Her brand of socialism favoured a united
working-class stand against capitalist oppression. In particular, she attacked craft and
sex exclusivism as incompatible with social justice.77

Inspired by her beliefs, she urged the union to extend its organisation to cover the
'female' sections of garment-making: dressmaking, millinery, shirtmaking and her own
trade, underclothing.78 At a time when many traditional assumptions were being thrown
into question by the European war, her appeal struck a chord. In 1915 and 1916 the
Clothing Trades Union absorbed the small unions covering these women's trades.79 For a
brief period between 1915 and 1919 women and men were equally represented on the
executive committee. Amongst the new members were such able women as Lesbia
Keogh, 'a fragile but strong-minded woman', representing the dressmakers.80 Graduate
of Melbourne University's law school in 1916, Keogh decided that her talents could be of


-----

more service to the working class in a factory than a legal firm. Better known as the poet
Lesbia Harford, she was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and
closely connected with Melbourne's radical Left until leaving for Sydney in 1919.81 Her
obvious abilities as a public speaker assured her rapid rise to prominence in the union.
She became a member of the Dressmakers Wages Board in 1916 and vice-president of
the union in 1917, the first woman to occupy any official position within the organis¬
ation.82 Together with Francis, she led the move to radicalise the union, organising lecture
series for union members and urging the union to give official support for 'working-class
campaigns', such as anti-conscription, the 1917 railway strike and the release of the
imprisoned IWW members.83

Both Keogh and Francis fought to wean the union from what they saw as its sexism, by
no means a secondary consideration. The men were prepared to admit the women's sec¬
tions to membership because they brought with them valuable funds, but they were
reluctant to see this turned into a female ascendancy within the official hierarchy of the
union. The first organiser appointed to recruit amongst the new sections was a man,
John Cain, who secured the position despite much opposition from the women.84 In the
period immediately following amalgamation in 1915 the increase in membership was
spectacular. As Carter, somewhat overwhelmed by the response, wrote to one of his col¬
leagues: 'At the present time we cannot cope with the number of women desirous of
joining our Organisation.'85

By 1916 women comprised over 85 per cent of the union's membership, but still the
'old guard' resisted the appointment of a female organiser. As Francis herself points out,
the appointment of Miss Lillian Whitford in April 1917 was more the result of a 'fluke'
than any fundamental change in the union's position.86

The issue of the female organiser also illustrates the underlying motive behind the
union's official support for equal pay for the sexes. Despite repeated calls for Whitford to
be paid the same rate as the male organisers, the request was rejected. Whitford eventu¬
ally resigned over this issue, complaining that she was the worst-paid official at Trades
Hall.87 The bulk of the funds and energies of the union continued to be devoted to the
tailoring section, even though by 1918 its members were in a minority.88 Such official
neglect did little to counter the hostility of employers in the non-tailoring sections, who
continued with impunity to victimise and blacklist workers who joined the union.89

Gender divisions thus limited the CTU's effectiveness in advancing the position of its
female members, especially those in dressmaking, millinery, shirtmaking and
whitework. However, the all-women unions which preceded the amalgamations of the
war period also had limited success, and merging with the tailoring unionists helped
overcome some of their earlier difficulties. It also placed workers in a stronger position to
resist the powerful blend of paternalism and patriotism which developed in many cloth¬
ing firms during the war. The Lucas Company of Ballarat is an outstanding example of
the way in which patriotism was mobilised in the cause of industrial peace as well as
military effectiveness. Edward Price, who assumed control of the company on his
mother's retirement in 1915, was a believer in the principles of efficiency' and shared
James Law's faith in the personal touch in industrial relations. But Price added a further
dimension to this intimacy. As early as 1910 a bonus system was in operation whereby


-----

workers were rewarded at Christmas for extra output during the year.90 The company
historian maintains that 'comradeship in work and shared belief in community service'
were the formula that ensured sound relations between management and labour. She
was referring specifically to the Lucas Company's efforts during the Great War. The
'Lucas Girls' were given every 'encouragement' to raise funds for troop comforts. The
famous Ballarat Avenue of Honour is claimed to be the inspiration of Mrs 'Tilly'
Thompson, Price's 'lieutenant'; the workers at Lucas' factory raised £10,600 towards the
cost of the trees and their plaques. The first instalment of money was the proceeds of a
football match waged between the Lucas Girls and the Khaki Girls of Melbourne.91
Price's eldest daughter was a member of this team. The workers were also allowed to
leave their machines to welcome and farewell troop trains, although they then had to
make up the lost time before going home at night. The purpose of all this ostentatious
patriotic activity was to encourage 'loyalty', both to the firm and its values. Like Law,
Price attempted to convince his workers that their interests were identical to his own, and
that unions were therefore irrelevant.

The small sectional unions in existence before the amalgamation were ill equipped to
deal with such energetic methods on the part of the leading firms in the industry. And
these firms were by no means isolated examples of such methods; the other leading shirt
and whitework firms also appear to have shared their approach.92 It was not until these
unions amalgamated with the CTU that any serious challenge was mounted to the
employer hegemony in these sections. Organising campaigns in 1917 seem to have had
some effect in unionising 'a large number of young ladies' from Lucas' factory.93

Ironically, the CTU had less success in resisting patriotic fervour at the Commonwealth
Clothing Factory during the war. The first serious difficulty arose in 1916, with both
the cutters and the machinists complaining that the manager paid the workers
disproportionately. Some workers were set higher tasks than others, whilst the senior
cutters claimed they were given no additional payment despite their extra responsibilities.
Slade, they said, 'is not a fair-minded man'.94 To complicate matters, there were also
problems caused by the introduction of new methods of work. The management sought
to balance productivity with justice by adopting the latest technology and methods of
manufacture. As a result, Slade attempted to introduce machines to do both pressing and
finishing. In both cases the workers resisted the new methods because they displaced
workers.95

The Defence Department, represented by Senator Pearce, portrayed the dissatisfaction
as the work of 'pro-German elements in the factory'.96 The Argus took up the cry, stating
that 'the state of the factory walls and the pavements around the factory' were evidence
of the existence of anti-conscriptionist elements in the factory.97 The Defence Depart¬
ment went so far as to employ blacklegs and government inspectors in an attempt to
break the strike.98 It also endorsed Slade's antagonism to the union in a letter to the
union secretary: 'Mr. Slade states he is at all times willing to hear any appeals or com¬
plaints, provided that they are made direct to himself and not through Mr Carter [CTU
Secretary]. The reasonableness of this will of course be readily recognised.'99

Despite strong support for the cutters' strike from the 600 workers at the factory, the
union was unable to resist the determined fight put up by Slade and the Defence


-----

Department.100 In the case of the finishers, the union adopted a different approach and
called in the Trades Hall Council's Industrial Disputes Committee to settle the strike. The
results were again disappointing for the workers. The Minister considered the matter
'trivial' and the IDC appeared to take it only marginally more seriously. They agreed
between them that the strikers should return to work on the management's terms and
that 'no one would be put off where it possibly could be avoided'.101

After these defeats the union's influence at the factory declined rapidly. According to
one worker, the union was 'a dead letter as far as the Commonwealth Clothing Factory
was concerned'. The 'anti-conscription elements' were overshadowed by the dashing dis¬
plays of the 'Khaki Girls', a patriotic band of women from the CCF who devoted their
spare time to fundraising and recruiting for the war effort.102 When Wallis attempted to
address the workers in the dining room in July 1918 he was forcibly removed by two
military officers and forbidden to return.103 The direct authority of the Minister was by
then replaced by the Board of Business Management of the Defence Department, but in
practical terms there was little difference between the rule of Labor Senator Pearce and
the virulently anti-Labor H. V. McKay who dominated the new board.104 The workers at
the Commonwealth Clothing Factory had learnt, as had the railway workers in New
South Wales, that state-run enterprises were just as prepared to attack workers' con¬
ditions as any private firm. While the Lucas Girls and the Khaki Girls played football to
raise money for the war effort, their employers, capitalist and state socialist, also met on
the common ground of 'patriotism'.

While the war in Europe and the activities of the state both had profound effects on
industrial relations in the clothing trade, the condition of the labour market continued to
have an important effect as well. The general economic recovery from the late 1890s made
the climate for unionism more favourable, whilst also encouraging more informal kinds of
worker resistance. This was especially so when workers knew they were not easily
replaced, such as in the seasonal rush from spring to Christmas. The generally improved
state of trade in all the sewing sections from the early twentieth century to the 1914-18 war
also favoured worker defiance. This took various forms. Employers complained that with
the shortage of female labour workers were becoming too independent. Factory Inspector
Collopy reported in 1909 that 'on account of the difficulty in obtaining labour, girls are
very often independent and careless at their work, and manufacturers say they are
frequently afraid to interfere, because they fear that the girls may leave them'.105

Factory-based strikes also occurred, such as the one referred to above over the issue
of the installation of new machines for finishing which displaced hand-finishing of
shirts.106 Collective bargaining at the factory level was also directed at raising rates of
pay. Mrs Margaret Powell referred to 'all our contentions and fights with Mr Keleher over
prices'.107 (Keleher was the manager of Foy and Gibson's clothing factories.) The
women's bargaining no doubt explains in part why even whiteworkers at Foy and
Gibson received what unionists considered 'a fair wage'.108

There are also hints of other, less easily categorised forms of group protest. As one
employer reported, 'the only trouble we have is a little hysteria'.109 No doubt everyone
but the manager appreciated the release such episodes afforded to the tension of working
under pressure with hundreds of machines filling the air with their whirr and clatter.

The singing which employers liked to think of as evidence of a happy and contented
workforce could also be used to make life uncomfortable for the boss: women vied with
each other to think up the most humiliating words to accompany popular tunes.110
Throwing reels of thread at unpopular supervisors was a more individual expression of
workers' exasperation with their conditions.111 When labour was in short supply, it was
also possible for individuals to extract concessions from employers by threatening to
leave for 'greener pastures'. As an employer expressed it, girls were 'becoming more alive
to their worth'. Another told of workers engaging in informal productivity bargaining,
citing 'constant instances' of girls accompanying their requests for pay rises with 'the
frank admission that they could do more work, and that if the rise were granted they
would'.112 And according to Ernest Aves, enquiring into the Wages Board system for the
British Government, the return of prosperity after the turn of the century put a natural
break on the imposition of tasks. He maintained that by 1906-08 things were 'finding
their level' as workers learnt to measure and regulate their output more effectively.113

In the final analysis, however, the Wages Board era had been a disappointing one for
workers. Initial wage increases were accompanied by more intensive workloads despite
the moderating effect of 'pacing'; and rather than the state assisting the most exploited
workers it quickly became apparent that the strongest workers extracted the greatest
rewards from the system. And as the century entered its second decade, other limitations
with the system became apparent. Most importantly, Wages Board decisions had no
jurisdiction outside the state of Victoria; the pace of change was thus limited by the need
for Victorian industry to remain competitive with neighbouring states.

The rapid inflation of the war period and the government's reluctance to allow cost-
of-living increases to flow on to wages caused further dissatisfaction. By 1919-20
inflation had eroded real wages to such an extent that wages and salaries in the clothing
trade constituted a mere 52.1 per cent of net value added, compared to 66.5 per cent in
1908.114 But undeterred by these experiences, workers turned once more to a state body
for relief, this time the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.

 The Workers Baffled: The Boot Industry, 1897-1910

Despite the advent of Wages Boards, the market for footwear continued to play a major
role in shaping the work process in the Victorian boot and shoe industry. The economic
recovery of the late 1890s was hampered in the boot trade by the rising price of leather.
The last few years of the century were particularly uncertain. Exports fell, and many
manufacturers stockpiled goods against further increases in the price of leather and
expected wage increases as a result of the Wages Boards. Even after federation the indus¬
try faltered. The increase in interstate trade as a result of the Commonwealth tariff
doubled Victoria's exports of footwear in 1902, but the following years were not ones of
steady and uniform growth. Drought caused a downturn towards the end of 1902, and
uneven tariffs caused problems for manufacturers of certain lines, particularly children's
shoes. The years between 1904 and 1907 were generally better, with manufacturers
extending their premises and putting in new equipment. By 1908, however, the post¬
federation boom was virtually over. Rising leather prices again caused disruption; more
serious was the increasing competition from neighbouring states.1

The intense competition which characterised the industry in the 1880s and 1890s thus
continued into the first decade of the twentieth century. Unlike sections of the clothing
trade, where the Wages Board determinations signalled a new direction in manufacturing
practices, in the boot industry competitive employers responded to the new conditions
by intensifying their depression strategies. Those without machinery either acquired it or
closed down, whilst those already mechanised were ever willing to install the latest
devices supplied by the British United Shoe Machinery Company (USMC).2

The most significant development in boot and shoe machinery during this period was
the consolidation of the role of the United Shoe Machinery Company. Arriving in Vic¬
toria with its Goodyear welter in 1891, the company initially sold its products as well as

9 A USMC advertisement of the early twentieth century would have had a mixed appeal to Victoria's
bootmakers. There were many amongst the ranks of both masters and men who felt a nostalgia for the
quieter methods of fifty years ago' and the days when the shoemaker's shop served as a centre for
political discussion (note the notice of a 'Town Meeting' on the wall).

leasing them. By 1900 it had perfected its royalty system whereby machines were avail¬
able only for lease, with payments fixed according to the output of each machine.3

At first sight the USMC's terms seemed irresistible. It cost a manufacturer almost
nothing to acquire the very latest in bootmaking technology and, as royalties were tied to
output, the manufacturer need not fear the burdens of meeting time-payments during
slack periods. It soon became obvious, however, that the scheme had its drawbacks.
Most important was the condition that the manufacturer agree to use USMC machinery

10 The new Rex pulling-over system, 1905. This picture shows the 'system's' key features: subdivision
of the process of pulling-over, with each subdivision tied to a different machine. Although women are
shown here as part of the 'team', Victorian boot manufacturers did not exploit this aspect of the system
which was promoted by the scheme's developers as a further advantage in cheapening production costs.

exclusively. Furthermore, replacement parts could be secured only from the company,
allegedly at inflated prices. Despite these drawbacks, the leasing system did enable
Victorian factories to keep abreast of the latest developments in boot machinery.4

Most of these developments were refinements of former models, with adaptations to
improve the quality of work or their ease of operation, as well as adding even further sub¬
divisions. The Goodyear welter and Blake sole-sewer were still the key pieces of equipment
in the making room. The development from 1905 of a mechanised and subdivided method
of pulling-over, known as the Rex system, completed the mechanisation of making.5 In
1906 the Argus reported of bootmaking that 'there is probably no manufacture in Australia
in which specialisation and the perfection of parts have been carried to a higher degree'.6
The clicking room, formerly the least mechanised section, experienced a dramatic change
in methods with use of presses for cutting uppers from 1907. The invention of machines
for folding uppers prior to sewing provided the first major innovation in women's work
since the introduction of the sewing machine. From the turn of the century these new
appliances were increasingly powered by electricity instead of gas or steam.7

Although electricity and the latest American appliances imparted a 'modern' air to the
early-twentieth-century boot factory, the most significant innovation was in methods


-----

rather than machines.8 Subdivision of the work process was a feature of the mechanised
factory from the outset but in this period the most up-to-date factories carried the pro¬
cess further, applying it to management as well as the shop floor. The separation of con¬
ception and execution, of mental and manual work, which is implied in the increasing
subdivision of tasks was systematised during this period. The boot operative, who in the
past had a working knowledge of the general processes involved in constructing a boot,
was left with only a small part of this understanding. As a Victorian writer for the
Australian Leather journal commented in 1902: 'With the exception of the clicking room
and rough stuff rooms, bootmaking is merely an assembling of parts, in the manufacture
of which the boot operative takes no part, and by the aid of machinery with the con¬
struction of which also he has had nothing to do.'9 This writer went on to point out that
if the operatives need less knowledge, foremen and superintendents 'have nowadays far
greater responsibilities than formerly'. Not only were foremen expected to assume the
burden of the operatives' displaced knowledge but they were also held responsible for
the discipline of the workers in their charge. As 'Boomerang', another Australian writer
on modern methods, explained, the foreman 'should also be a strict disciplinarian,
and allow no "larking" or unnecessary talking during working hours'.10 The stricter
discipline demanded in the modern factory extended to other forms of 'unnecessary'
behaviour: 'Allow no smoking, as it is disgusting, and a positive disgrace to any
manager when strangers enter and see men wasting their employer's time puffing or
chewing tobacco.'11

The concern to make the most economical use of the 'employer's time' was evident in
the increased monitoring of the worker's daily activity. At a general meeting of the
Bootmakers' Union in 1900 it was reported that 'machine Telltales' had been introduced
into the shops and a record of the time starting and leaving was kept by them, 'also the
time taken at the W.C.'.12 Other bureaucratic methods were also recommended. 'Boom¬
erang' advocated the issuing of printed slips to the men so that the foreman could tell 'if
any of them are not "earning their salt" '.13 Naturally, such a system would impose
additional demands on foremen so that large factories would find it necessary to appoint
a clerk to assist in the extra accounting.14

All this monitoring, however, would have been ineffective in saving labour without
attention to the basic principles of modern factory management. According to 'Boomer¬
ang', the first of these was the careful selection of workers and their specialisation in par¬
ticular tasks. Believing that 'every man is made to perform some particular duty in the
world', he urged managers to 'see that you get the right duty fixed upon the right man'.15
Some men, it seems, were born to spend their lives on the end of an American loose-
nailing machine. This being the case, they should be kept at the one class of work as
much as possible so as 'to get through more work and be more efficient than one who is
being continually shifted from one thing to another'.16

Extending this principle of finding the 'right' person for the job, tasks would be graded
according to the skill they demanded of the operative and work allocated accordingly. For
example, in the clicking room men would cut the good work; improvers would cut the
common work; boys and girls would be employed cutting linings and tending small
labour-saving machines.17


-----

Speeding-up accompanied this process of fragmentation. With machines placed so as
to ensure an uninterrupted flow of work, workers were kept at maximum pace by the
operation of the team system on weekly wages. Under this system each worker had to
work quickly and constantly to avoid holding up the team's work. The task system
ensured that the team as a whole worked hard in order to fulfil its quota. As 'Boomerang'
pointed out in his discussion of the putting-up (making) department: 'You will find it
to your advantage and profit if you work the whole of this room under the system,
especially if you determine to have good, quick workmen who are companiable with
each other, and will willingly look into each other's ways.'18

The machining and fitting room, being female territory, presented peculiar problems to
factory disciplinarians. This was largely because of the perceived 'nature' of the female
sex: along with the pig and the hen, woman had a nature which was always in oppo¬
sition. In order to counter this tendency, 'Boomerang' advocated the employment of 'a
good piece of domestic diplomacy'. Foremen were to treat their female workers with the
same skills they employed in the home in order 'to get a woman to do what you wish'.
Thus, it was no use appointing 'a big, clumsy lout of a man as overseer of machinists and
fitters ... or you will have half your girls in tears and the other half as obstinate as
mules', which in either case means a great loss of time.19

But it seems that women's affinity with pigs, hens and mules was not the end of the
problem. 'Boomerang' also advised foremen to keep all materials under lock and key, as
'many girls are like magpies, whose acquisitiveness amounts almost to an act of theft'. In
fact, the difficulties in making this female department profitable seemed altogether too
daunting. 'Boomerang' claimed that he knew of no factory able to show a profit on its fit¬
ting and machining room. This, he believed, was largely the result of the restricted
supply of female labour in Australia. 'You cannot "make a silk purse out of a sow's ear",'
the columnist concluded.20

All this represented a more systematic and 'scientific' approach to management than
that applied in the nineteenth century. It still, however, lagged behind methods in
America's most up-to-date factories. Here the process of separating conception and
execution was carried a step further. Instead of the employer's relying on the personal
supervision of the foreman, there was 'a desire completely to anticipate all supervision
from the office'. For instance, the subdivision of orders into convenient departmental
quantities was made in the office rather than by the departmental foremen, thus placing
greater dependence on office routine. The foreman, thus freed from such decision¬
making, was able 'to confine his attention to the criticism of the work, and, in smaller
firms, (it enabled] the abolition of the foreman altogether'.21

Victorian factories were also less specialised than American firms, although after fed¬
eration there was a dramatic change in this respect. Whereas factories in the 1890s pro¬
duced up to sixty different styles of footwear, by the early twentieth century most had
restricted themselves to producing styles within the one grade, such as pumps, bricks or
children's.22

In general terms, the market for boots and shoes thus continued to play an important
part in shaping the work process and the nature of the industry by creating a situation in
which manufacturers sought new ways to remain competitive. It would be misleading,


-----

however, to suggest that employers were free to choose whichever strategies suited them
best. As in the nineteenth century, workers could and did affect the decisions made
about the work process. But for both workers and employers, the 1896 Factories Act
marked a significant departure in industrial relations. Whilst previously their conflicts
had been settled on the shop floor and picket-line, after 1896 they became focused on
the meetings of the Wages Board. The issues, however, were unchanged: How was work
to be organised? Who was to make this decision? How hard would employees have to
work and for what reward? Mutually acceptable answers were to prove elusive.

In November 1897 the Wages Board, in which the bootmakers had placed so much
hope, overturned its original 45-shilling minimum wage for adult males and replaced it
with a mere 36 shillings. Union Secretary Billson, usually the voice of moderation and
compromise, was bitterly disappointed. As he told the Trades Hall Council:

The law, the Government and the manufacturers all seemed in league to baffle the workers. The
workers had been peaceful and keeping clear of strikes in order to secure for themselves a fair mini¬
mum wage under the Factories Act, but the very fact of their being peaceable and submissive had
been taken advantage of.23

Billson certainly had ample grounds for complaint. The union had persuaded its mem¬
bership to avoid strikes in the hope of a more 'civilised' solution to their grievances.
Although the 1896 Factories Act was not all they hoped it would be, it nevertheless did
provide for the creation of Wages Boards, offering some prospect of a negotiated peace.
But the deficiencies in the Wages Board system were obvious from the very first sitting.
Employers and employees viewed each other with uncompromising hostility, unable to
agree on any major points. This left the chairman, police magistrate J. Keogh, in the pos¬
ition of arbitrator: his casting vote decided every point at issue. As he was very well
aware, his lack of practical experience was a significant deficiency in arriving at an
informed decision.24

When the first determination was announced towards the end of 1897, more serious
flaws in the system, from the workers' point of view, were exposed. The majority of
employers immediately protested to the Chief Secretary against what they saw as an
impossibly high male minimum wage of 45 shillings per week. The Chief Secretary,
Alexander Peacock, responded to their appeal by invoking the provisions of the Act
giving him power to suspend the determination for a period of up to six months. In the
meantime, he referred the question of the minimum wage back to the board, again
placing the onus on the chairman to reach a decision. Keogh, after hearing further evi¬
dence, decided to vote with the employers, reducing the minimum to 36 shillings. To
unionists, the employers' arguments reeked with hypocrisy. William Greenwood,
Bedggood's manager, argued that a minimum of around 35 shillings would be more
effective as it was so low 'it would not pay a man to try and get the better of that wage'.
Hugh Thomson suggested that 'the result of raising the minimum to such an extreme [45
shillings] would mean that the men would be over-wrought'. John Abrahams com¬
plained that Victorian manufacturers could not make goods cheap enough to compete
with the protected local product in Western Australia. He added that he 'was positive that
35 shillings was not enough for a man to live on but he must take into consideration the


-----

state of the trade'. Evading the question of how he intended to operate his factory with
labour unable to live, he also pushed the humanitarian line that the 45-shilling minimum
would increase sweating by forcing employers 'to sell the material to the men and buy
back the goods'. That such transparently self-interested arguments were the ones which
swayed Keogh raised serious doubts in workers' minds about the benefits of the whole
system.25

For the unionists, this defeat seemed far more serious than any they had suffered
during strikes or lockouts. The employers had, in effect, turned the workers' final
weapon against them. For some the irony was too much. Chummy Fleming, for instance,
left the union to start a Tittle repairing shop'. He gave as his reason for leaving the union
that he 'had fought and suffered with it' but he 'would not work for a scab's wage of 36
shillings'. He added that 'a number of the old fighters who had been in the [1884] lock¬
out also left the Union'.26

Nor did the task of rallying the newer members prove any easier. Thomas Walker com¬
plained at a union meeting that 'there was not a spark of unionism in the whole trade. It
had all been crushed out of them.'27 Committee member Robert Solly agreed with this
assessment, saying that 'unless the bootmakers were prepared to fight as their forefathers
did . . . they deserved no better treatment than was being meted out to them by Parlia¬
ment and those entrusted with the administration of the Factories Act'.28 However, as
Billson pointed out, it was more than 'vitality and fighting spirit' that was needed: 'The
operatives, instead of combining solidly and fighting vigorously, divided themselves into
sections, said nasty things about each other and permitted the Fat-man ... to sit back in
his easy chair, smile and laugh up his sleeve at their weaknesses and disunion.'

There was, indeed, a distinct lack of co-operation between the Bootmakers' Union and
the Clickers' Union. This continued after the amalgamation of the two sections in 1897,
the clickers distinguishing themselves by their lack of general interest in union affairs.
The fact that the makers and finishers, the mainstay of the union, considered the clickers
'were not taking the interest in organisation that they should do' caused considerable
resentment. Indeed, one member accused them of being a 'mean lot of Skunks' for
accepting higher wages fought for by other sections.29 On occasions even the makers and
finishers failed to present a united front. An attempt by the finishers at Hyams' factory in
1898 to obtain 'better wages and abolition of task system' failed when the makers
refused to support them, even though they 'agreed that the Finishers were right'.30

The 'female branch' was separate again, with each of the male sections vying with the
other for the women's patronage at Wages Board elections.31 Unlike the tailoresses, the
female boot operatives did not elect female delegates, putting their trust in the men to
represent their interests. Their trust was sometimes misplaced, as the 'misappropriation'
of the branch's funds by the honorary male treasurer and secretary showed.32

Nor did the 1896 Act initially encourage co-operation among these sectional unions in
the same way as it did in the clothing trades. Rather, it fanned the flames of rivalry . The
disappointment accompanying the fate of the first determination promoted apathy and
despair rather than the 'strong, united, vigorous and determined fight' for which the
union leadership called.33 The 'mass meetings' organised by the union to consider the
factories legislation during 1899 and 1900 were a grim reminder of this apathy, often


-----

attracting as few as 20 or 30 out of a total membership of more than 900. The union was
so weak that when breaches of the Factories Act were discovered it responded by taking
the employees concerned out of the factory and providing them with funds until alterna¬
tive employment could be found. Victimised unionists were similarly assisted.34

The efforts of the 'old fighters' to inspire resistance to the 36-shilling minimum did,
however, bear some fruit. Although disappointing by the standards of earlier campaigns,
sufficient support was forthcoming to sustain 'constant complaints and representations'
to the Chief Secretary until a revised determination was brought in in July 1898.35
Although not restoring the 45-shilling minimum, it raised it significantly to 42 shillings.
Considering the alternative most workers seemed reconciled to this rate. Furthermore,
the vexed questions of boy labour and female labour had been settled with a reasonable
degree of satisfaction, at least to the adult male workers. Ironically, this apparent victory
encouraged complacency rather than militancy amongst boot operatives in general.

The effect of these early determinations on the unionisation of the female workers was
particularly important. As long as women presented some threat to the general wage
standards in boot factories, the men were anxious to encourage their organisation. This
became an even higher priority once the minimum was declared, some employers prefer¬
ring to employ cheaper female labour rather than pay even the meagre amount of 36 shil¬
lings to a man. The workers' delegates had been instructed to raise the matter on the
Wages Board in order to 'settle the Question of Defining Females work in the Factories'.36
The encroachments were on the 'male' departments of making and finishing, the men
being determined to 'do Their best to stop it if possible'.37

Not surprisingly, the employers were less than enthusiastic about the union's attempt
to fix a clear line of demarcation between men's and women's work. After several
months' negotiations the union agreed to raise the age at which lads could be considered
'improvers' to twenty-one (instead of eighteen) on condition that the employers would
agree 'to restrict the Employment of Females to machining and fitting department'.38 The
new determination, effective from 18 July 1898, thus provided for equal pay on all the
major male work. Although in the trade-off 'the age limitjs] for both Males and Females
had been so altered as to nullify their effect', the union hoped that the ratios limiting
juvenile employment would prevent excessive use of boy labour.39

The men were effective in their attempt to restrict female labour to traditional 'female'
work. Despite the increase in the percentage of boot workers who were female from 29.2
in 1898 to 36.9 in 1910, there was no significant shift in the sexual division of labour.
(See Appendix, Table A8.) Male unionists, ever alert to attempts by employers to break
down this division, in 1910 could find only 'one or two instances in Victoria where girls
were doing male work'.40 The increasing proportion of women employed is explained by
the continuing advances in 'labour-saving' machinery for men's work compared to the
lack of innovation in machinery for sewing uppers.41

Having disposed of any threat females presented to male jobs, the union officials and
executive, all of whom were males, virtually ignored the female membership. As male
rates of pay gradually crept up over the next ten years, first to 45 and then to 48 shillings,
females received no advance on their original 20 shillings. There is no evidence of any
female involvement in Wages Board cases after the original case in 1897. Little effort was


-----

made to organise women, despite several requests by female members for official action.
When the THC wrote to the VOBU in 1905 regarding organisation of females, it 'was
decided to ask Shop Presidents to endeavour to get two or three and report to next
mtg'.42 None reported back. In view of the fact that the male unionists were supposed to
be representing their female workmates on the Wages Board, it is quite alarming to read
a 1907 Federal Conference resolution which regretted that the 'absolute lack of organis¬
ation prevents us at this juncture drawing up conditions of labour, etc., for [female]
departments'.43 In fact, when the union finally reached the federal Arbitration Court in
1909 it made no claim at all on behalf of its female members, although there was 'plenty
of evidence of the necessity of and the desire of the Females to get an alteration of the
unsatisfactory conditions'. The reason given was that their small numbers meant Tittle
hope of success at the present juncture'.44

Women members were even denied the roles traditionally accorded to them in labour
circles. When the Children's Hospital Bazaar Committee asked the union to nominate
two female representatives, Mrs Billson and Mrs Solly, wives of the secretary and presi¬
dent respectively, were chosen.45 Similarly, on union social occasions the 'Wives of the
Members of the Executive' were invited to act as the refreshment committee.46

The neglect of women by male unionists was made easier by the high turnover of
female workers. In 1901, 53.5 per cent of female boot workers were under twenty-one
years of age.47 By 1906 the figure was approximately 60 per cent.48 As with the sections
of the clothing trade where juveniles predominated, unionisation of such workers was
difficult even where the will to organise existed. All the women active in the 'Female
Branch' before its amalgamation with the VOBU were single.49 This fact, and the general
youth of the female workers no doubt made it easier for the men to patronise them.
Indeed, it was the women themselves who unanimously voted for a male unionist to rep¬
resent them on the Wages Board rather than a member of their own sex. They also sought
men to act as officials.50 It would probably not have surprised the female unionists that
the men took it upon themselves to 'guarantee that no intoxicating Drink should come in
the Hall' during a social evening held by the Female Boot Operatives Union in 1896.51

Part of the problem in sustaining a union movement for men and women arose from
the very novelty of the situation. Boot workers were the first in Victoria to attempt such
a thing. Indeed, the male unionists agreed to amalgamate with the women only on con¬
dition that the 'Trades Hall will permit of mixed meetings (Male and Female)'.52 While
the rules proved amenable, it was probably more difficult for women to penetrate the
intensely masculine milieu of the union meeting.

Left to their own devices, female boot operatives for the most part reverted to the limited,
more spontaneous protests of pre-union days. For instance, when one young woman was
sacked without explanation in 1899, rather than appeal to the union, she had her mother
tackle the proprietor directly. The incident resulted in the mother, Alice Niebert, bringing
an assault charge against the manufacturer after he struck her with a heel planer and
kicked her into the street'. In his defence he argued that the complainant was excited 'and
commenced bullying him, and refused to leave the shop'.53 The 'magpie acquisitiveness'
complained of by employers could also be seen as an individualist response to the failure
of the official bodies to award reasonable wages to female workers.


-----

The problem of boy labour was not so easily resolved to the satisfaction of the men.
From the union's point of view, the employment of boys on 'some monotonous process of
machine service, in which the only promotion possible for the human being is to become
a machine himself', was not only detrimental to the youths concerned but also in the
long run undermined the bootmakers' claim to a skilled rate of pay.54 Unable to restrict
entry to his occupation or to insist on standards of training, the bootmaker was unable to
maintain rates of pay which his former monopoly of skills made possible. Indeed, by the
early twentieth century the new regime had so devalued his skills that he was paid less
than a builder's labourer.55 The discrepancy between bootmakers and other tradesmen
was even greater. Cabinet makers, for instance, who were awarded the same minimum
as bootmakers under the Wages Board in 1897 (45 shillings) were by 1909 receiving 64
shillings per week compared to only 48 shillings being paid to bootmakers.56 The fact
that under the Wages Boards employers were obliged to provide grindings, colours,
power and equipment was little compensation for this decline in status and remuner¬
ation. The 1896 Factory Act had done little to prevent this process of deskilling. The pro¬
portional limitation on the apprentices and improvers who could be employed, provided
for by the very first determination, offered only a temporary check to the growing prac¬
tice of using boys instead of men. Even supposedly reputable employers like the
Bedggoods made no secret of their preference for cheaper juvenile labour. As John
Bedggood reasoned: 'At 20 they are called "improvers" and get 20s a week, and at 21 the
law makes them "adults", and forces us to pay them a minimum wage of £2/2/- a week
###### .... so we get rid of them.'57 An influential section of boot employers was thus deter¬
mined either to overturn the Factories Act altogether or else get rid of the apprenticeship
clauses. From the turn of the century these employers joined with others in the Victorian
Employers Federation, which was formed from a desire to counter the Wages Board
legislation. It is significant that boot manufacturers such as T. Y. Harkness and

J. S. M. Thompson were prominent in the affairs of the VEF.58

It was this anti-labour offensive on the part of employers which finally aroused the
Bootmakers Union from its apathy. The early years of the century saw a Trades Hall
industrial organising campaign initiated by Fleming on behalf of the bootmakers.59 The
program of 'shop-by-shop organisation of the trade' included an attempt to reorganise
country centres, which met with mixed results. As in the 1890s, attempts to organise
Geelong bootmakers were not successful.60

The success of the employers in having the apprenticeship restrictions lifted in 1903
was the signal for a renewed effort. In its desire for a 'thorough organisation', the union
'was prepared to take all and sundry into the fold Women Boys and Men . .. '61 Signifi¬
cantly, special provisions were made to attract boys to union membership.62 The task was
not an easy one, however; the secretary found that some workers required 'a little more
Independent Spirit' as they refused to join the union until receiving a guarantee that
their employers were not hostile.63 Nevertheless, the union pressed on, a committee on
boy labour and the 'ever-increasing task system' vowing to 'try and force' a remedy
should the law fail to do so.64

Identifying the legislature as a crucial arena of conflict, the bootmakers determined to
get more sound Labor men returned to state parliament. Indeed, two of their own

number, J. W. Billson and Robert Solly, were successful candidates. The union was also
an enthusiastic supporter of Tom Mann, urging the Trades Hall to engage his organising
skills in order to boost the Labor vote. The connection between the appointment of Tom
Mann, the return of Labor to state parliament and the control of boy labour was explicitly
made in a report by VOBU secretary Long in 19 0 4.65 Plans for a federal union, until then
merely dreams of a few visionaries, were given priority on the union agenda. The setting
up of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in 1904 held out the
prospect of a more sympathetic hearing than that experienced in the Wages Boards.

The campaign for industrial federation was also stimulated by the political federation
of the colonies in 1901. Until then, employer arguments against wage increases out of
consideration for their intercolonial trade had had relatively little force in protectionist
Victoria. The Commonwealth changed all this. Uniform duties on overseas imports and
free trade between the states gave employers a much stronger case for keeping Victorian
wage rates at least on a par with those in rival states.66 The fact that New South Wales
had no apprenticeship restrictions also created problems for unionists seeking to limit
juvenile labour in Victoria. A federal award, providing uniform conditions throughout
Australia, would thus overcome objections to improved wages and conditions on the
basis that such improvements would disadvantage Victoria's manufacturers in compe¬
tition with other states with lower standards.

A further reason for the union's enthusiasm for federal arbitration was the failure of
the Wages Board to provide any check on the use of the team system and the 'brutal and
vicious system of weekly wages' to speed up workers.67 The method of payment played
an important part in intensifying work. The mechanisation of factories was from the
outset accompanied by the use of weekly wages. This practice continued into the twenti¬
eth century in Melbourne factories, and was invariably accompanied by set tasks
designed to force the pace of work.68 The effectiveness of this system in speeding up
workers was all too obvious to employers, who soon extended the practice to hand¬
work.69 Arthur Whybrow, one of the modern manufacturers, assessed the advantages of
weekly wages over piecework: 'Under the log rate method of paying, the workman was
careless and irregular, and there was no inducement for the employer to get the most out
of his workmen's time by systematic management.'70

The Wages Boards, which workers hoped would remedy this grievance, in fact had the
opposite effect. The piecework log had been designed to correspond to the original mini¬
mum wage of 42 shillings. When this was replaced by the 36-shilling minimum the dis¬
parity between the two systems of payment was very great. The effect was similar to that
in the clothing trade: manufacturers would not use pieceworkers when they could get the
work done so much more cheaply by weekly workers. The 1896 Act therefore dealt the
final blow to the already declining piecework system. By 1898 there were only 300
pieceworkers compared to 3329 on weekly wages.71 Ten years after the first
determination, Factory Inspector Shay reported that she had little trouble in enforc¬
ing the minimum wage but the task system was still a problem, combined
as it was with management which was more disciplinarian, with 'very strict super¬
vision' kept on workers 'so as to get as much work done as possible for the money
paid'.72


-----

In the light of these developments, the union's earlier agreement to weekly wages in
conjunction with machinery was revealed for what it was—a tactical concession made
from a position of weakness. As soon as the Wages Board offered the possibility of
increased bargaining power for workers, the official policy was reversed. A mass meeting
of the trade, held to elect Wages Board delegates, agreed to Fleming's resolution that all
delegates sign a pledge to support piecework for makers and finishers whether working
by hand or machine. The male clickers and female fitters and machinists, who were less
subject to speed-ups and preferred weekly wages for their own work, agreed to 'go along
with the rest of the trade re piece work'.73

A committee was appointed to draw up a schedule of piece rates but from the outset
the project encountered difficulties. In mid-June 1897 it reported that 'it is not practicable
to work on a peace [sic] work statement in conjunction with the Machines in Making'.74
The committee apparently persevered and later that month presented the schedule for
machine making to the Wages Board. Despite the employer delegates' threat to resign
over the issue, the unionists voted to proceed with their claim.75

In the meantime, the board's determination specifying the 36-shilling minimum
weekly wage and piece rates for handwork came into operation at the end of 1897. This
further strengthened the men's resolve to fight for piece rates on machine work. Any
minimum wage, they argued, led employers to select the 'race horses of the trade' and
pay them the minimum wage; the old and the slow were discharged to 'walk about and
starve'.76 Their objections were supported by the fact that 300 men were registered with
the union as unemployed, 'mostly the old and slow workers the minimum was supposed
to protect'.77

Attempts by the union's delegates to have the Wages Board reconsider the question
during 1898 and 1899 failed to produce a machine scale of piece rates. The employers
argued that such a scale was impractical, 'and if practical undesirable'. They stated that 'it
would require more time and attention to Book the work in and out to the operatives
than to make and Finish the Boots'.78 The chairman, Keogh, showed his usual indecision
and refused to cast his vote either way.79 Thereafter the workers abandoned the attempt
and turned instead to devising ways to abolish the task system.80

When the attempt to abolish the task system failed, unionists looked for ways to regu¬
late it.81 There is no evidence that employees' delegates sought Wages Board determi¬
nations which specified tasks or quotas to be achieved before workers received the
minimum wage. It is unlikely that such a scheme would have met with the board's
approval. Unionists relied on more direct methods of regulating output. The problem,
however, was not a simple one. Young men in particular engaged in record-breaking
contests amongst themselves. Although these kinds of games were more usually associ¬
ated with piecework, the rewards for individuals were similar. As Burawoy and others
have noted, playing games enabled workers to survive psychologically in an increasingly
alienating work environment.82 But the long-term effects of this 'self-murdering game'
on the workers, individually and collectively, were only too apparent to the union leader¬
ship.83 Unionists could also see that a solution to the resulting speeding-up lay with the
workers themselves. If they all slowed down, none could be singled out for dismissal and
they would still get the same wage. The difficulty was to inspire the 'race horses' with


-----

such a collective spirit. The services of Ben Tillett were enlisted in 1898 to speak against
racing.84 A few years later, as noted earlier, the union pressed the THC to engage Tom
Mann as an organiser. It is probably no coincidence that Mann was an advocate of
output limitation, arguing that if employers would pay only low wages they must expect
a smaller effort from their workers.85 This propaganda against racing seems to have been
effective, as little mention is made of such games after 1900. It is probable that with the
recovery of the industry in the next decade workers were successful in collectively mod¬
erating the effects of the task system. They did not, however, eliminate it and the poten¬
tial remained for employers to speed up workers in times of recession by choosing only
the fastest workers.86

Difficulties also occurred in the union's attempts to regulate the use of machinery. The
men were not opposed to the machinery as such, realising from past experience in their
own co-operative factory that a factory 'could not succeed without modern equipment
and therefore large capital investment'.87 Rather, they believed that it should not be only
the employers and the public who benefited from the cheaper production of the
'labour-saving' machines: 'the introduction of machinery in the trade should result in an
improvement in the conditions and a reduction in the hours of labour'.88

The ideal, at least, was shared by manufacturers. The leather Journal, extolling the
virtues of modern bootmaking machinery, waxed lyrical about the romance of the evol¬
ution of the cobbler of yesterday into the marvellous 'stitcher' of today—'a practical, sen¬
sible romance which builds up capital and incidentally elevates labour'.89 In reality the
tale of mechanisation, from the workers' point of view, bore more resemblance to
tragedy than romance. As Higgins pointed out, the so-called 'labour-saving' machines
saved no labour to the worker: 'These machines require close attention and great care, in
order to avoid the spoiling of the material, or the maiming of the workers. The strain of
the work is intense.'90

That the workers were not sharing in the benefits of modern technology they believed
was due mainly to the use of boys instead of men to operate machines.91 Not only did the
boys displace adult workers but their unrestricted use meant that they were usually
taught to operate one machine only, as employers could not hope to provide all-round
training for such large numbers of apprentices. This in turn led to the deskilling of boot
operatives as a group, reducing both their status and their earnings. As Higgins
expressed this problem: 'If competent men resisted low wages, the employer probably
could make shift to get on with the "improvers" for a while, until the journeymen saw an
empty cupboard and hungry wife and children, and were brought to their senses.'92 But
it should be stressed that it was not the machines themselves which were held respon¬
sible by organised labour for this state of affairs: it was the way in which they were regu¬
lated. The union's new banner, commissioned in 1907, showing operatives working the
new machines, represented a willingness to incorporate the realities of the modern fac¬
tory into the traditional conception and iconography of the craft.93 Employers and
workers alike agreed that although the machines were quicker it took a good deal of
practice before an operator became expert in their use.94 Some of the more difficult
machines were said to require two years' training and this was to master one part only of
the process of boot construction.95 To avoid the monotony and deskilling of such


-----

mechanised work and to increase the workers' flexibility and bargaining power, the
union suggested that all boys be apprenticed and taught the whole range of machines
connected with any particular process. Thus, a lad apprenticed to 'welting' would learn
not just the hand process but also the Goodyear welter and rapid stitcher and the other
machines associated with making a welted boot.96 This represented a compromise
between the older practice of apprenticing lads to 'making', 'finishing' or 'clicking' and
that favoured by employers of making each of the major machines separate subjects for
apprenticeship. The employers were anxious to reinforce the subdivision of work by iso¬
lating the skills acquired on each individual machine. At the other extreme, by tying
apprenticeship so closely to the construction of different types of boots, rather than to
separate processes in general bootmaking, the union was attempting a reintegration of
the labour process and greater worker flexibility.97

Early attempts by unionists to secure a Victorian Apprenticeship Act to implement this
scheme were unsuccessful, while such an innovative scheme had little chance of being
accepted by the Wages Board. Even the union's claim for substantial increases in juvenile
wages was rejected by the chairman as a surreptitious way of limiting boy labour and
was thus declared 'contrary to the law as passed by Parliament'.98 As Billson argued at
the first interstate conference of boot unions, a federal union would have prevented the
disastrous results from past strikes and also have 'insisted on men instead of boys on
machines'.99 An appeal to the federal court for a new system of apprenticeship thus rep¬
resented the major reason behind union organisation in the period 1903-09, as the regu¬
lation of boy labour was believed to be the key to a satisfactory accommodation with the
new machinery and methods.100 At the same time, the union appealed for shorter hours,
as this was seen as a way of avoiding unemployment caused by the spread of
machines.101

These years also coincided with a change in the leadership of the union. The leaders of
the 1880s and 1890s had by 1904 all moved on or died. In 1904 Arthur Long, active in
both the Melbourne and Ballarat unions since the late 1890s, was elected secretary. His
was not only a fresh face but also a new style. Free of any association with the bitter con¬
flicts of previous decades, Long's conciliatory approach appeased many hostile
employers.102 Convinced that strikes were 'an old-fashioned, barbarous method' of
settling disputes, he determined to organise the trade for an early appeal to the federal
court.103 The Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration thus became the
focus of the workers' hopes for benevolent state intervention, so bitterly disappointed by
the Victorian legislature.

For the employers, the union's decision to approach the federal court was most unwel¬
come. Suddenly the Wages Board system, previously denounced as 'the most disastrous
legislation that has ever been perpetrated on an industry', became 'equitable and concili¬
atory', giving 'fairly general satisfaction'.104 In fact, the Wages Boards had done little to
modify the bitter legacy of the depression years. Any decrease in open conflict was due
more to the 'crushed spirits' of the workers than to their greater faith in the generosity
and goodwill of employers. Indeed, it could be argued that the employers' behaviour
over the first determination increased the level of mistrust by betraying what in the past
had been one area of common ground: the mutual fight of employer and worker for high

protective tariffs. As the Bootmakers' Union indignantly wrote to the Chief Secretary on
the reduction of the minimum wage in 1897:

We also desire to protest against the Exports of Victorian made Boots and Shoes being brought in evi¬
dence as a reason for reducing The Minimum Wage. The Workmen have assisted the Manufacturers
and The Government to obtain a duty which would Protect them and prevent low wages being
enforced in This Colony and now having got Protection for the Manufacturers The retention of the
Intercolonial Trade is given as a reason for the payment of Low Wages ... 105

This experience led workers to be far more cautious in future. Although they were still
prepared to co-operate with manufacturers to obtain high federal tariffs, protection was
no longer the unifying force it had been in the nineteenth century.106 The manufacturers
had come to appreciate more fully that protection was a two-edged sword, high duties
on imported footwear being offset by tariffs on imported leather. Boot manufacturers
were therefore less enthusiastic about high duties on the former if it also meant high
tariffs on the latter.107 For their part, the workers no longer believed in the good faith of
employers to pass on the benefits of protection to their workers. Their appeal to the fed¬
eral court was therefore a recognition that state intervention was necessary to reinforce
the 'mutual trust' so dear to employer polemicists.

Ironically, the employers were also placing their faith in state action to defend them¬
selves against this renewed worker mobilisation. In their case, they hoped that an appeal
to the High Court would invalidate the Commonwealth Arbitration Court's decision.108
The collapse of the Boot Manufacturers' Association after the settlement of the federal
tariff should not be seen as an indication of lack of interest on the part of employers. It
was in all probability part of their strategy to thwart the machinery of the federal court,
forcing the union to cite individual manufacturers as respondents rather than an
employers' association.109 But although this succeeded in causing the union considerable
inconvenience, it could not prevent industrial relations in the Victorian boot trade
becoming focused at a federal level.

The Wages Board system clearly played an important role in structuring worker-
employer relations in the years 1897-1910, while the decisions arrived at by the board
had direct effects on the ways in which work was organised at the factory level. Antici¬
pation of the minimum wage encouraged a further frenzy of mechanisation in the late
1890s; sections previously untouched by machines, such as strong work, either mechan¬
ised or moved interstate where handwork was not subject to a piecework schedule. The
fixing of a minimum wage in itself sounded the final death-knell to the piecework system
in factories, as it was cheaper to operate on a system of wages and tasks than on the
piece rates prescribed by the board.

The board's determinations also influenced access to different sorts of jobs. Equal
pay provisions reinforced the existing sexual division of labour, while limitations on
the numbers of juveniles employed initially discouraged their employment. Con¬
versely, when these restrictions were lifted in 1903 there was a significant increase in
the number of juniors of both sexes engaged for boot factory work. The proportion
of boys increased from 30.8 per cent in 1902 to 37.7 per cent in 1906. The percentage


-----

of female workers under twenty-one years increased from 54.1 to 57.2 over the
same period.110

The market for female factory labour provided some check, however, on the employ¬
ment of female juniors. There were reports of difficulties in attracting enough girls to
boot factories as early as 1899 but these became more frequent in the period 1905-09.111
In the latter year, Factory Inspector Thear reported that one firm at least was offering a
2s 6d bonus to girls for each of their friends recruited to the work.112 Nevertheless, the
fact that almost 60 per cent of the workers in the upper-closing rooms were not entitled
to even the small wage set for adult women must have limited the incentive for technical
innovation in this section. And the fact that such workers were difficult to organise and
easily ignored by male unionists ensured that their minimum rates of pay remained at the
1897 levels throughout this period.

The Australian market for boots and shoes also played a major role in defining the
limits of productive reorganisation. Changing fashions heralded the rise and fall of
whole sections of the trade, as the decline of strong work before the advancing light¬
weight, machine-sewn boot demonstrates.

The size of the Australian market limited the types of labour process which were prof¬
itable. The more restricted application of scientific management methods to Victorian
factories compared to those in America can largely be explained by the different markets
each industry supplied. For instance, the reason that foremen in Victorian factories con¬
tinued to play a more central role than those in America was not ignorance of American
practices. The Leather Journal kept manufacturers informed of overseas trends, and many
Victorian boot manufacturers travelled abroad, especially to America, where they
observed the latest methods.113 As the Leather Journal noted, 'there are men in the trade
who are quite alive to the advantages of specialisation and classification'.114 Nor was it
because of a fondness for the 'happy-go-lucky, go-as-you-please system in vogue in
some factories'.115 Rather, it reflected the more restricted nature of the Australian market:
'the population has hitherto been too small, and therefore the demand too limited'.116 It
was much easier to 'anticipate all supervision from the office' when each factory limited
its production to a few standard lines. This was also the reason that Australian manufac¬
turers gave for preferring weekly wages to piece rates, as was the American practice. The
degree of specialisation in Australian factories made piece rates impractical and would
require 'an army of juvenile clerks' to record the output of different sizes and styles.117

To some extent, however, Victorian manufacturers imitated the 'efficient' methods of
American producers, despite the fact that the American methods were designed for a
much larger product market. The short-term expansion of Victoria's interstate trade after
federation obscured the real limitations of the Australian market. After the initial expan¬
sion and 'modernisation' of methods, Victoria's boot factories were left with excess
capacity. As early as 1904 the Leather Journal observed that to provide full employment
for the plant now erected 'requires not merely a steady demand, but an ever-increasing
and ever-booming consumption of boots and shoes'.118 Part III will show how far the
Australian market was able to fulfil this requirement.

 Educating the Girls: The Printing Industries, 1901-1925

The most striking feature of the printing industries in the first few decades of the twenti¬
eth century was the application of new technologies. Applied in Victoria from the turn of
the century, these processes put colour and illustration into a whole range of previously
unadorned products and created a taste for artistic display which transformed the world
of advertising and packaging.1 The economic recovery after the late 1890s meant an
expanded market for commodities, providing an ideal environment for the indulgence of
these tastes. The expansion of Victorian markets after federation in turn increased the
demand for both advertising and packaging.

And whilst consumers were aware of this transformation in the public face of the
products they purchased, less visible were the equally radical changes occurring behind
the scenes in the printing and packaging factories. Workers of both sexes in a whole
range of occupations, from compositor and lithographer through to cardboard-box and
paper-bag makers, were all affected by these new techniques. These effects were, how¬
ever, very uneven. The new technologies in some cases created new skilled work or
required enhanced skill from traditional craftworkers. In other cases, workers were both
displaced by the new machines and deskilled by the subdivision which accompanied
them. In still other instances, new technologies created new categories of 'unskilled'
workers.

These changes at the market and technology level were mediated through the determi¬
nations of the various printing industry wages boards. Uniform limitations on the
number of juveniles who could be employed helped to counter the growth of boy labour
which had occurred in suburban and country composing rooms during the depression of
the 1890s.2 Forced to pay journeymen's rates for hand composition, many employers
installed linotypes or their cheaper imitations to reduce their wages bills.


-----

In the women's sections of the industry, the slightly increased minimum rates awarded
by the boards also encouraged mechanisation. The paper-bag industry, for example,
remained a largely hand industry until the first determination of the Wages Board in
1907. Although this increased wages by an average of less than two shillings, compe¬
tition from imported bags made by unregulated labour led Victorian manufacturers to
mechanise as many lines of bags as possible.3

A similar trend occurred in the women's sections of bookbinding. In the early 1900s,
Victorian firms acquired machines which had been in use in Britain since the 1880s.4 The
rapid expansion of printing in the first decade of the twentieth century would probably
have necessitated the use of the machines eventually. However, the Wages Board deter¬
mination meant that women's sections were already mechanised when shortages of
female industrial labour occurred from 1907 which would otherwise have precipitated
this change.

At a more general level, the legal sanction which Wages Board determinations gave to
the demarcation between men's and women's work, combined with the low rates paid to
women, was crucial in deciding the pattern of industrial production in the printing
industries in the twentieth century. These determinations were in turn the product of the
sexual politics of the industry as a whole.

In April 1912, Walter Gee, bookbinders' delegate on the Printers Wages Board and presi¬
dent of the Women Bookbinders Union, suggested to a meeting of the male bookbinders
that 'this society should endeavour to obtain some control in matters with the Women
Bookbinders such an affiliation would strengthen our hands and the Girls could be edu¬
cated as to how far they could do Bookbinding'.5 The members needed no further per¬
suasion and immediately resolved to seek an amalgamation of the two unions. Enforcing
the line of demarcation between men's and women's work thus continued to be a major
preoccupation of male bookbinders, despite the legal sanction given to this sexual
division of labour by the Wages Board determinations. By 1900 the point at which
'unskilled' work ended was at quarter-bound cut-flush work which had paper sides
turned in over the end-boards. This was embodied in the first determination of the
Printers Wages Board in 1901, the only subsequent alteration being the 1902 Wages
Board decision to allow women to operate the new indexing machines at the female rate
of sixteen shillings per week. Any infringements on 'male' territory by females were in
this period dealt with by the Factories Office as well as the union.6 The men were fortu¬
nate in the attention given to their complaints by Factory Inspector Alfred Bishop. A
compositor by trade and former union activist, he was appointed to the Factories Office
in 1902 where he remained to provide a 'sympathetic interpretation of his duties' to the
workers until his death in 1932. His background no doubt made him more willing to
police demarcation issues than would perhaps otherwise have been the case.7 The com¬
bination of legal sanction and vigilant administration meant that the threat of cheaper
female labour was effectively contained.

Nor did the early twentieth century realise earlier male fears that the industry would
be swamped by female labour. Mechanisation and subdivision operated on the work of
female bookbinders to restrict opportunities for women. Contrary to the claims of

historians, there was no significant increase in the proportion of women employed in book¬
binding over the period 1900 to 1925.8 On the contrary, there was initially a decline in the
percentage of women employed as women's work was mechanised in the first decade of
the twentieth century. From the turn of the century, increasing numbers of firms installed
the new folding machines, such as the ones advertised in Figure 11. Machines were also
used for staying, wire-stitching, punching, round cornering, gluing and numbering,
together with improved models of sewing machines which could handle the back sewing
of ledgers previously done entirely by hand. These machines, combined with 'an intense


-----

specialisation' of tasks, initially reduced the numbers of female workers in bookbinding
firms. By 1925 the figure had recovered to 20.8 per cent of total employees, but this was
still below the 1898 percentage of 24. (See Appendix, Table A9.)9

Given that there seems no real reason for male bookbinders to have felt especially
threatened by women workers in this period, why were they so anxious to interfere in
the affairs of the women's union? Their concern seems to have been based on the poten¬
tial threat that women represented and in particular on the spectre of an entirely female
union over which they would have no control. Their fears were fuelled by the fact that
the women's union was being organised by two well-known socialist-feminist activists,
Miss Ellen Mulcahy and Mrs Barry.10 Having no particular sympathy for either socialism
or feminism, the male bookbinders saw the rapid growth of the new union as a challenge
to their supremacy on more than one front. Feminists, in particular, alarmed the male
craftworker as they challenged the basis of his 'skill' and encouraged women to attempt
new, more lucrative avenues of employment. The Woman's Sphere, for instance, advo¬
cated bookbinding, along with boarding-house keeping, as 'other avenues for women':

The practical part of the work can be learnt in a short time, and is most interesting and pleasant.
Artistic designing, gilting, etc., are advanced departments, requiring special talent and skill, but
simple binding can be learnt by anyone who has a taste for mechanical work, and should furnish a
much more remunerative livelihood than many occupations in which some of our women are eking
out such struggling existences ... 11

The fact that a 'female' was teaching her own sex the art of bookbinding for a fee of
£4 4s per quarter no doubt added to their alarm.12 And they were no more prepared to
acquiesce in this challenge to their masculinity than were the typographers before them.

For their part, the women, under the tutelage of Barry and Mulcahy, sought a relation¬
ship of independent co-operation with the men. The blatant self-interest of the male
bookbinders must have been only too evident to the women. Without a union of their
own until 1910, they were also without a female representative on the Wages Board.
Their interests were left in the hands of the men. That 16 shillings was fixed as the gen¬
eral minimum for female bookbinders in 1902 indicates how strongly these men pushed
the case of their female shopmates. Male bookbinders received a minimum of 52 shil¬
lings, while even the most 'highly skilled' women—the sewers and takers-down of
letterpress—received a mere 20 shillings, the same as the most poorly paid adult woman
under the Clothing Board.13 The cardboard-box and carton section, which had three
women as well as two men on its Wages Board, was able to secure minimums of 18 shil¬
lings and 22s 6d respectively (payable after four years), even though prior to the determi¬
nation employers were paying up to 6 shillings less than these amounts.14

When the minimum male wage in the printing trades was raised from 52 shillings to
56 shillings in 1906, no increase was claimed for the women. As Inspector Bishop
reported, this did not go unnoticed by those affected:

The remark has been made to me that the Board did not show much consideration for the females
working under the Determination as affected by the bookbinding provisions, as they have made no
attempt to get them an increase in the low minimum of 16 shillings, and comparisons were made
between this rate and that paid in the boot and clothing trades, where the minimum is 20s. The
females have no representative on the Board.15


-----

Women employed making stationery, who from 1911 were covered by the Women
Bookbinders' Union, were even worse off, having no determination at all covering their
occupation until 1917. They were, consequently, amongst the lowest-paid of all female
industrial workers.16

With this history of men's efforts on behalf of their female workmates in mind, women
unionists were cautious of any alliances with the men's union. They were prepared to ask
men's advice on industrial matters and even to have them as honorary presidents, but
they were determined not to subordinate their separate identity to the patronage of the
male Bookbinders Union.17 When it came to membership it was 'strictly a women's
union', while the important office of secretary was reserved for women.18 The fact that
no separate provision was made for a women's representative on the Printers Board lim¬
ited their independence, however, forcing them to rely on the male bookbinders to 'fight
their case'.19 This proved a serious problem as the men did not fight their cause with
much conviction. Shortly after formation of the women's union the women formulated a
claim to raise all wages for women to a flat rate of 30 shillings, rather than the two exist¬
ing rates of 18 and 20 shillings. The bookbinders' delegate said the men were 'rather
dubious' of presenting the claim as the chairman would not accept it. They suggested the
claim be for 28 shillings in the case of sewers and takers-down of letterpress and 24
shillings for others.20 The men succeeded in getting only 21 and 23 shillings
respectively, and this was decided without calling evidence.21 At the same time, the
bookbinders were 'proud to say that the men were the second highest paid trade under
the Wages Board System'.22

Despite this obvious handicap, the women tried to maintain their independent stance
even after the formative years when Barry and Mulcahy had moved on. They continued
to receive support from older labour women, in particular Mrs Minnie Felstead and Mrs
Louisa Cross, both feminists with strong records of organising within the industrial and
political labour movements.23

By the end of the 1914-18 war, however, the situation was changing. Moves toward
the One Big Union affected the printing industry as they did the clothing trades. The
women, too, were affected by the logic of 'one industry, one union', although their
experience of the fraternity of male unionists made them wary of formal amalgamation.
The post-war record of this relationship did little to allay their fears. For instance, in
1920 Secretary Cross received a report that Frank Burke, Wages Board delegate and sec¬
retary of the Bookbinders Union, had negotiated with an employer to introduce the
'speeding-up system' to his shop. Louisa Cross regarded this as a 'very serious matter'
and reported it to the executive of the male union. The executive, suspicious as ever of
women taking initiatives, were unsympathetic to Cross's appeal, their president, Arthur
Leovold, implying that the women were pursuing some feminist cause rather than a
'working class issue'. Cross was quick to reply that she saw no necessary distinction
between the two, but rather that she had always done her best to further the interests of
'working women'. She contrasted her position to that of Burke who, as Wages Board
delegate, 'had never given us any assistance'.24

It was in this atmosphere of mutual antipathy that attempts were made by the federal
body of the Printing Industry Employees Union of Australia to draw the remaining


-----

Victorian unions into the Big Union of Printers'. It took the Melbourne printing strike of
1920, however, to convince the women that alliance with a large industrial union was in
their best interests.25 Concerns about the quality of the race and national security,
heightened by the recent war, also played a part. Improving the conditions of working
women in order to improve their child-bearing capacities assumed more importance than
the concerns of feminists for women's independence. Minnie Felstead, acting president of
the Women Bookbinders and Stationery Employees Union at the time of amalgamation,
expressed this change of priorities:

As an advocate for equality this woman's question is no question at all. There are modes of interaction
that know no cavilling of great or less, and the erection of a sex barrier in the Trade Union Movement
is economically unsound. Men may have the intellectual fathering, but women must have the physical
mothering of the Movement; and I think that the amalgamation of the Printing Industry of Australia
will be a big step in the improvement of the working conditions of the women employed, and
thus help to make them fit daughters of the country's noblest traditions and fit mothers for her
future sons.26

But, although Felstead hoped for a relationship which knew 'no cavilling of great or
less', still the women's suspicions of the men remained. Their reluctance to join the
PIEUA was not, as Hagan argues, due to their anxiety to follow the lead of the typo¬
graphers. It was rather that they hoped to amalgamate on terms which would not render
them completely voiceless in the new organisation.27 The terms accepted by their New
South Wales counterparts were certainly not encouraging in this respect.28 Indeed, they
could not have been totally unaware of the contempt with which they were regarded by
some of the men in the PIEUA. For instance, one of its officers wrote understandingly to
Leovold, secretary of the Victorian Bookbinders Union, at the time of the amalgamation
proposals: 'As you know, Women are funny "Cattle" ... Take them all round they're a
damned nuisance.'29

Certainly the women faced considerable opposition in their attempts to get equal treat¬
ment under the terms of amalgamation. The Provisional Board of Management was itself
stacked against the Women Bookbinders, according them 15 delegates to represent their
800 members, the same number allowed the male Bookbinders with a membership of
300.30 The Typographers Society, with just over twice the membership of the Women
Bookbinders, were allowed over five times the number of delegates (77). This weighting
was significant in that the Provisional Board decided a number of important matters
affecting women, such as the structure of the new branch and the rates of pay for the
woman organiser.31 The executive committee was similarly stacked against the women's
sections. The Women Bookbinders and Boxmakers were given the same number of
delegates as the male Bookbinders, even though they had twice as many members, while
the Typographers were given twice as many delegates as any of the other sections.32

The question of a female organiser for the new branch proved the decisive issue. The
women were determined that specific provision should be made for a paid organiser of
their own sex.33 The fact that all the paid officers of the other amalgamating unions were
to be retained by the PIEUA gave them their way. The Women Bookbinders Union
immediately made their honorary secretary, Louisa Cross, a full-time, paid secretary on a


-----

salary of four pounds per week.34 There was thus a certain onus on the PIEUA to provide
for her as well as for the male officials. The men were by no means happy about the
arrangement, but could hardly object as it appears that the Bookbinders had used exactly
the same tactic a few weeks earlier.35

In any case the majority conceded the point rather than lose the chance of 'controlling'
the women.36 They consoled themselves with the thought that it was only a temporary
concession, which could be reviewed after the amalgamation was sealed. As the New
South Wales secretary put it, 'the price must be accepted until time and experience cause
changes'.37 To hasten the lessons of time and experience, the men backed an attractive
young woman for the position of female organiser against the solid personality of Cross,
hoping that an 'early marriage' of the former would provide an opportunity to appoint a
man in her place. As one of the male officers quaintly expressed it: 'Regarding the lady
organiser, the most desirable girl from our point of view is certain to be snapped up to be
President of a Union of two with prospects of increasing to not more than a dozen.'38
Alas, Cross was elected by a sizeable majority of the female members.39

But although the Women Bookbinders succeeded in having a woman organiser
appointed, like the women in the Clothing Trades Union they could not secure her equal
pay.40 Nor could they secure any revision of the PIEUA rules regarding representation of
women on the federal council. Most of the men argued that the council was constituted
to consider the 'big questions', and could therefore see no possible reason why women
should want special representation. Advisory committees, which were allowed for each
section, had no power to do other than advise the board of management. The board was
under no obligation to accept their recommendations.41

The rules were eloquent, however, on the advantages the men expected from amalga¬
mation. Rule 5:8, for instance, stipulated that 'Members of the Women's Advisory Com¬
mittees shall not accept employment in the section of the industry now covered by male
labour, without having obtained the permission of the Board of Management, and shall
use every endeavour to discountenance any proposal to this end.'42 There were thus
severe structural constraints on the role women could play in the Big Union.
Theoretically they had an equal chance with the men for offices such as president, sec¬
retary and delegates to various industrial councils. But in practice their smaller numbers
ensured that they were rarely successful. The pessimists were vindicated when even the
female delegates to the Trades Hall Council were defeated by three men.43

Before the formation of the PIEUA, the only other printing union with women members
was the Cardboard Box and Carton Employees Association which also embraced paper-
bag workers. Approximately 75 per cent of the workers in this section were women and
they provided the overwhelming majority of union members.44 Formed in 1906 by a small
group of women anxious to have a Wages Board appointed for their trade, the union was
assisted in its efforts by members of the Trades Hall Council Organising Committee.45 Cer¬
tain 'fair employers' were also sympathetic to the Wages Board, as they found that 'even
with their advanced machinery and allowing for the smallest margin of profit, they cannot
retain orders, as, no matter how low the price they quote, some of the manufacturers in the
trade will cut lower'.46 The agitation was successful and the necessity to select delegates for
the Wages Board assured the association of an ongoing existence.


-----

It quickly became obvious, however, that men and women would play different roles
within the union structure. Although the union had been established by women, within
a year the offices of secretary and president were filled by men.47 Women still formed
almost all the positions on the executive committee and were generally far more active
members than the men.48 Indeed, on several occasions the union found it impossible to
muster sufficient men to form a committee to draw up a log of claims for men's occu¬
pations on the Wages Board.49 The same half-dozen men in fact carried the burden of
representing their colleagues from the time of the first Wages Board until amalgamation
with the PIEUA.

It would, therefore, be wrong to assume that the role this handful of men played was
not welcomed by the female membership. On the contrary, it was women who nomi¬
nated men for official positions and women's votes which secured them in office.50 It was
certainly not a case of an active male membership organising to elect their own sex in the
face of apathetic female members.

Why then were these women so willing to be governed by male officials when their
counterparts in bookbinding held out for so long as a separate women's organisation?
The major reason seems to be the inexperience of women unionists compared to men.
The high rate of 'wastage' amongst women activists in the Cardboard Box Association
meant that any potential officials were not around long enough to build up comparable
expertise. The men's attitude to the appointment of an attractive young woman to the
position of organiser was based on a firm appreciation of the limitations that women's
domestic roles placed on their industrial activity. All too often a promising young female
unionist would be lost to the cause as a result of marriage. The arduous and often
unpleasant nature of the work, in many cases made worse by the new machinery and
methods, possibly also contributed to girls' leaving the trade for more pleasant work.51
Employers had every incentive to employ juveniles in preference to adults because their
labour was so much cheaper. The specified ratio of apprentices or improvers to adults
under the Wages Board determination provided little deterrent to their employment, and
the increasing subdivision of labour provided ample scope for the use of quickly trained
girls.52 In the 1920s, between one-third and one-half of female workers in the printing
and allied trades were under twenty-one years of age, with the figure for cardboard
boxmaking approaching 50 per cent. The tendency to employ juveniles was so pro¬
nounced that it was felt necessary to include a clause in the 1925 arbitration award stipu¬
lating that 'no department shall be manned exclusively by juniors'.53

The importance of age as a factor determining women's union involvement was com¬
mented on by contemporaries. Jean Daley, herself a labour activist, writing in 1934,
observed that

If there are few women on the executives, or in official positions, it is largely because the industrial
life of a woman is largely incidental. The real business of life is to marry and become wife and mother
just as it has been in all ages. As a rule, the older woman is an active union worker, the juvenile
worker very indifferent both politically and industrially, with shining exceptions.54

Her point is well illustrated by the printing unions. Unlike the Women Bookbinders,
the boxmakers did not have any members of the ilk of Ellen Mulcahy or Louisa Cross.


-----

Mulcahy seems to have been committed to politics rather than husband-seeking, and
devoted many years of her life to this cause.55 Louisa Cross was representative of the
married woman who was relatively free of domestic ties and was therefore in a position
to make a long-term contribution to unionism.56 The women in the box and carton
union were, by contrast, almost invariably young and marriageable. They rarely stayed in
the workforce long enough to accumulate much industrial experience. This inexperience
had several effects on the pattern of industrial relations. Firstly, it meant that the spon¬
taneous, factory-specific protests which normally characterised pre-union militancy per¬
sisted for many years after the formation of the Cardboard Box and Carton Employees
Association. Unused to industrial action and union procedures, the predominantly
young workers sought their own remedies to specific problems.57

The demographic composition of the boxmakers' association was also important in
determining methods adopted by the men to enforce the sexual division of labour. With
such an apathetic male workforce and so young a female membership, male unionists
realised that direct action was 'out of the question' for their industry.58 They were thus
particularly anxious to enlist the aid of the state, firstly in the form of a Wages Board
determination and later in an appeal to the federal court. The claim was the familiar one
of equal pay for the sexes when engaged on 'men's work'.59 Direct action against women
unionists was resorted to only when the state failed to support the union's claims for
equal pay. In 1920, for instance, the Wages Board, on the casting vote of the chairman,
rejected the union's claim for equal pay on rotary cutting and scoring. In response the
union declared any female filling a vacancy on these machines 'to be guilty of disloyal
conduct to the Association and will be dealt with accordingly'.60

A third factor of importance was the limited revenue which such a membership gener¬
ated. As contributions were roughly proportional to members' earnings, a predominance
of female juniors did not produce a very healthy bank balance. This factor was an
important influence on the union's willingness to link up with the PIEUA. Members were
assured that the Big Union was interested in 'Men, not Money': 'of course that includes
women too'.61

The sexual politics of the printing industry clearly played an important part in deter¬
mining work processes and work practices. These effects are most apparent in relation to
decisions of the various Wages Boards. At the most obvious level, the location of the
demarcation line sometimes encouraged new methods. The fixing of a woman's rate for
machine indexing and a man's rate for hand indexing, for example, encouraged the adop¬
tion of new mechanical methods.

At a more complex level, the definition of all women's work as unskilled, and the low
rates awarded, encouraged the employment of young workers who saw their work as a
stopgap only. Women and girls solely dependent on their wages were unlikely to choose
the printing industry when earnings were so low and prospects for advancement negli¬
gible. In 1909, for instance, Inspector Cuthbertson found that the eighteen shillings paid
to most female print workers was at least two shillings short of what it cost a girl 'wholly
dependent on her own resources' to live 'decently'.62 The Women Bookbinders Union
found that 'girls leave the trade to seek other avenues of employment owing to the poor
remuneration for the work performed'.63 The absence of mature single women and


-----

married women with dependents in turn reinforced the nature of the work: the young
girls who comprised the majority of the workforce made ineffective unionists and failed
successfully to challenge the intensification of the work process, its subdivision or its
remuneration. The speed, unpleasantness and dead-end nature of the resulting work
methods fed into a kind of vicious circle by contributing to the high labour turnover.

The hostility shown by men in the industry to women workers had its effects in other
directions. In addition to acquiescing in such low rates for women's work, male book¬
binders showed a distinct lack of concern for the conditions under which women
worked. There is little comment on the printing union's official attitude to scientific man¬
agement. In August 1911, the Typographical Journal published an editorial praising
Taylorism, but six years later the Printing Trades Journal published an article hostile to the
'pernicious system known as "Taylorism" '.64 The impression is that the matter was a
purely academic one, as most of the craftsmen in the printing trades did not have first¬
hand experience of the more negative sides of scientific management methods—
subdivision of tasks, speed-ups and monotony. The case discussed earlier involving the
secretary of the Bookbinders' Union, Burke, and speeding-up of women workers in fact
suggests that men may have directly contributed to the deterioration of women's work
experience. Even where conditions were supposedly safeguarded by the Factories Office,
there are suggestions that this protection was not forthcoming. Inspector Bishop, diligent
in his policing of any stepping across the line of demarcation, was less vigilant in the case
of the almost all-female boxmaking section. Indeed, the union complained of the failure
of the Factories Office to inspect boxmaking factories, and that 'when inspectors do come
to the factories which was very seldom they do not enquire whether the girls were receiv¬
ing the correct piece rates'.65

Nor was it possible for women, unassisted, to challenge the definition of their work as
unskilled. In the case of women in bookbinding and stationery, they did not even have a
representative of their own sex on the Wages Board. The men who supposedly rep¬
resented them were more interested in maintaining the difference between women's
work and 'skilled' work in order to preserve their own margins for skill. Those in the
cardboard-box and paper-bag sections, who did have women representatives on the
Wages Boards, lacked the industrial strength needed to back up any serious challenge to
employers on the board. The apprenticeship system afforded women no protection
against definitions of their work as unskilled. The four-year 'apprenticeship' provided for
by most determinations was merely a way for employers to avoid paying adult rates to
juniors. The employers, who did not recognise these occupations as skilled, were under
no obligation to teach the girls anything.66 And while restrictions on the proportion of
apprentices in male trades protected the status of the 'craftsmen', the absence of such
effective limitations contributed to the poor bargaining position of women workers.

Unlike the women, both compositors and bookbinders were able to use apprenticeship
to preserve their occupations as 'skilled' trades. In the case of the compositors this
involved a combination of restrictions on the number of apprentices and the revival of a
more thorough training scheme. In both these endeavours they had the co-operation of
members of the Master Printers' Association, who wanted to limit boy labour in the
offices of their competitors and also benefited from the greater technical expertise on the


-----

part of their journeymen.67 Despite improvements to the linotype which made it more
versatile, the 'iron comp' could still not replace the human version when it came to dis¬
play work. The increasing demand for such work in newspaper advertising and publish¬
ing as well as in the jobbing trade created a new role for the twentieth-century
compositor. With the straight matter being set on the linotype or monoline, the hand
compositor was left with what he claimed was the most 'skilled' part of his old work,
that part which called upon his artistic rather than his more mechanical talents.68 As the
union argued in its case before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbi¬
tration in 1925, 'the skill of the hand compositor doing display work under modern con¬
ditions calls for more of the skill of the artist than of the artisan'.69

Employers, too, felt that the modern conditions of composing required a generally
higher level of expertise than that acquired by most tradesmen who picked up the trade
in the 1880s and 1890s. It was agitation by the Master Printers' and Overseers' Associ¬
ations which led to the setting up of technical classes in printing in the late 1890s to help
fill the gap between the knowledge of the old tradesman and that required of the
twentieth-century craftsman. In 1911 Mr B. McMahon, instructor in printing at the
Working Men's College, reported that 'the necessity of the classes is shown by the
number of Master Printers who send their apprentices for tuition, in many instances
paying their fees, and others half the fees; as they have neither the time nor the oppor¬
tunity, and often not the qualification to give the necessary tuition'.70

The male bookbinders, unable to make a case for additional training, concentrated
their efforts on limiting entry to the craft at the apprenticeship level. Restrictions on
proportions of boys, in practice in operation since the 1870s, were embodied in the
Wages Board determinations. Like the compositors, their effective union organisation
ensured that these proportions generally were not exceeded even during the period
1903-08 when legal restrictions under the Wages Board were inoperative. The
bookbinders thus continued to be recognised as skilled workers in spite of employer
attempts to challenge parts of their work as 'skilled', while compositors had their craft
status reinforced by the active assistance of employers.71

Linotype operators, those 'princes and potentates of the printing world', had more in
common with bookbinders, using their industrial muscle to ensure their continued
acceptance as the elite of the trade.72 Lrom the outset, compositors had obtained control
of the composing machines and were able to have this work defined as skilled because of
their strategic position when the machines were introduced. Before the Wages Board was
established the Typographers' Society had been able to obtain the employers' agreement
to a very favourable scale of piece rates for machine composition and a maximum work¬
ing week of forty-two hours. Most importantly, only qualified compositors or apprentices
in their final year of training were allowed to operate the machines.73 These conditions
were embodied in the first Wages Board determination and maintained throughout the
years to 1925. Minimum rates for linotypists were originally set 35 per cent higher than
those for hand compositors. Although the margin narrowed to 15 per cent over the ensu¬
ing twenty-four years, many continued to earn very high sums on piecework. In 1926,
for instance, piecework linotypists on the Melbourne Herald averaged £12 to £14 per
week, with some men exceeding £14. The male basic wage at the time was only £4 4s.74


-----

And although linotype machines had originally displaced compositors, the expansion of
the printing industry meant that opportunities for employment in this trade increased
significantly in the early twentieth century. Indeed, it is not at all surprising to learn that
in 1927 their spokesman declared that 'we do not regret the introduction of these
machines, although the position was pretty bad at first'.75

The combined effect of these provisions was the continued recognition of linotypists as
'specialists', while in other cases where workers were doing the more straightforward,
manipulative aspects of a craft the work might be seen as fragmented or deskilled. The
work of sewing machinists, for instance, bears a relationship to the craft of garment¬
making similar to that which the work of the linotype operator bears to the broader craft
of typesetting. Lacking the bargaining power of the latter, sewing machinists were
treated as less skilled than tailoresses while linotypists were treated as more skilled than
hand compositors.

One might wonder why it was that these craftsmen, who were able to secure their
status and pay at such relatively high levels, continued to work in unhealthy and danger¬
ous environments. Ironically, these two factors were opposing sides of the same coin.
Referring to the period before 1925, Hagan and Fisher comment that

Piece-work compositors showed great interest in the early deaths of their fellows, and attributed most
of them to the type of dust that accumulated in the crowded and ill-ventilated offices in which they
worked. But despite some quite passionate statements not once did they take industrial action to have
owners reduce the dust in the air. Instead they preferred to work at hazard, claiming compensation in
higher setting rates for the shortening of their working lives.75

There were also other compensations for tolerating unhealthy conditions: such con¬
ditions helped preserve men's sense of manliness and deterred female employment on
their work. The industrial strength which supported this craft status derived, at least in
part, from the fact that linotypists were men.76 At the same time, their willingness to
work in such conditions was also a function of their masculinity. The dirt, noise and
fumes associated with the composing room did not decrease with the introduction of the
linotype machine. Indeed, as Ava Baron points out, these features of the Mergenthaler
were ones which commended it to male compositors in preference to other, cleaner com¬
posing machines.77 In the nineteenth century the grime of the composing room was used
to justify the compositor's craft as a masculine occupation. In the twentieth century the
same features were used to define linotyping as 'men's work'. This was particularly
important given the resemblance of linotyping to that rapidly expanding feminine occu¬
pation, typewriting. In the 1920s, with the movement for shorter hours, the health haz¬
ards of the trade assumed a different tactical significance, but this should not obscure the
lingering importance of the association of danger and dirt with masculinity.78

The question of danger was one which also affected the bookbinders and boxmakers.
The dangers which guillotines posed to their operators were exacerbated by the refusal of
many operators to use the safety guards provided because they saw such guards as a reflec¬
tion on their 'ability as workmen'.79 Females and boys were not allowed to use these
machines, the implication being that tackling such danger required a man.80 The slur which
the guards cast on the operator's ability was also seen as a slur on his manliness.


-----

There is no evidence that the first two decades of the twentieth century saw any sig¬
nificant modification of this definition of masculinity. Men approached the Arbitration
Court in 1925 with much the same preconceptions as their predecessors had taken to the
Wages Boards. Nor were the women of the 1920s any better placed to mount a challenge
to male definitions of their work. We have already seen how amalgamation with the
PIEUA did not enhance women's power within the printing unions. Ironically, women
were assured of a representative of their own sex on the Printers Wages Board only when
it was clear that the Wages Boards were to be superseded by the federal court.81 The fact
that prior to going to the court in 1925 the decisions regarding the relative margins for
skill in the industry were decided in conference between male employers and male
unionists is a clear expression of women's position within the PIEUA.82 We shall see in
the following section how this arrangement was to affect both men and women under
federal arbitration.

The era of the Wages Boards had thus brought mixed benefits to workers in the printing
industries. It had bolstered the position of those able to define themselves as craftsmen in
all sections by giving legal reinforcement to existing lines of demarcation between skilled
and unskilled work. Physical conditions in many factories improved. Some workers also
achieved substantial initial wage increases under Wages Boards. Those working in non¬
union firms had their hours and wages raised to those prevailing in the big unionised city
establishments. Suburban and country firms were also forced to employ more
journeymen because of the limitations on boy labour which already applied to city busi¬
nesses.83 For men employed in the city firms, however, the Wages Board made little
direct difference.84 Women in most branches of printing and bookbinding also gained
some initial increase in wages, despite the low minimum of 16 shillings awarded them.
As Inspector Cuthbertson reported, 'the rates formerly paid .. . were very low'.85 The
'very small number' engaged on book-sewing, for which 20 shillings was awarded,
received little benefit.86 Women in the cardboard-box and carton trade fared better,
receiving 22s 6d and 18s per week respectively under their first determination in 1908,
representing an average wage increase of over 5s per week to each employee.87 The fact
that piece rates were set by the board also brought significant benefits to workers, in par¬
ticular by preventing the arbitrary cutting of rates as soon as workers earned more than
the minimum wage.88 Female workers in the stationery trades were by comparison very
badly off. With no determination until 1917, their wages were amongst the lowest of any
trade. In 1909, for instance, adult women averaged only 16s 4d per week, while the large
number of juniors brought the overall average down to 11s 5d.89

But apart from these benefits, the Wages Boards had, by the early 1920s, proved a dis¬
appointment. Wages failed to keep pace with the rapid inflation of the war period so that
by 1920 all workers were receiving less in real terms than they had been in 1913. This
experience led workers to place more emphasis on shorter hours as a more durable gain
than wage increases, but again the Wages Boards were a disappointment.90 In 1920 an
eight-week strike, involving women bookbinders as well as compositors and male
bookbinders, failed to win a 44-hour week for the Victorian industry. The old strategy of
using direct action in conjunction with Wages Boards had finally proved bankrupt.


-----

The workers concluded that 'wages boards as they function in Victoria are a futile
institution. They seem to exist merely to make minor adjustments and suggested inno¬
vations are looked upon with extreme disfavour.'91 The federal court seemed to offer
more promise, being less constrained by statutory limitations on its powers. It remained
to be seen if it would 'be any better as to results'.92

###### PART III

 The Era of Federal Wage-fixing


-----

-----

The object of the wages boards is primarily to prevent sweating or under-payment; the object of the
Federal Court is to preserve or restore industrial peace.1

Justice Higgins' comments identify the fundamental difference between the federal and
Victorian systems of industrial regulation. This difference in purpose was reflected in the
powers and functions of each tribunal. Where the Wages Boards sought merely to eliminate
sweating by fixing minimum standards in wages and hours, the jurisdiction of the Com¬
monwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration covered any matter in dispute between
the two parties.2 The Wages Boards thus had limited powers only to deal with such import¬
ant issues as the regulation of apprenticeship and equal pay for the sexes.

There were other obvious differences between the two systems as they were originally
structured. The court's proceedings resembled practices in civil courts, rather than the
conference style of the Wages Boards. The emphasis on the resolution of disputes placed
employers and employees in an adversary relationship from the outset, in contrast to the
boards where it was assumed that members had at least a common interest in suppress¬
ing 'sweaters'. And rather than the practical and practising employers and employees
who sat round the boards' tables, the case for each side in the federal court was conduc¬
ted by professional advocates. These were usually paid officials of employer organis¬
ations or unions, although lawyers were also found conducting cases.3 Lacking the
current practical knowledge which board members brought to their discussions, the court
relied on the evidence of witnesses supplied by each side.4 Similarly, where chairmen of
the Wages Boards were laymen, the court was presided over by judges who attended to
their duties dressed in legal robes and wigs.

A further significant difference, at least from the point of view of employers and
workers, was the costs of each system. Board members were paid for the time they spent
in conference and as they generally sat in the evening there was little lost work time to be
provided for. By contrast, the court sat during the day and witnesses had to be reim¬
bursed for the time lost from work. As proceedings covered more than one state, the par¬
ties also had to provide travel and accommodation expenses for witnesses and advocates.
Where legal counsel was employed, this too had to be paid for. The court involved
further expense to the party initiating the dispute, which was usually a trade union:
notices of the union's claims had to be forwarded to each employer named in the case;
should the employers reject the claims, as they usually did, further typing and postal
charges were incurred in serving notice of the date of the hearing on employers. Where
there were numerous individual employers involved, such as the hundreds engaged in
the clothing and boot trades, such administration was extremely costly to the petitioner.5

The federal system also entailed long delays which were not evident with Wages
Boards. The large number of cases compared to the small number of judges and the
necessity to call witnesses accounted for the time-consuming nature of court
proceedings. By the 1920s, delays of eight months were usual, while many industries
waited from one to two years or longer for their cases to be heard.6

Decision-making processes in each system revealed other differences. Where the
Wages Boards proceeded in a rather ad hoc fashion, with almost no guidance from the
legislature, the federal court was more concerned to achieve consistency between its


-----

various decisions.7 This was helped by the fact that only a few judges presided over all
the cases. More importantly, judges showed a legal concern for precedent and principle
which was not evident in Wages Board rulings. As Higgins himself pointed out, the
'awards must be consistent one with the other, or else comparisons breed unnecessary
restlessness, discontent, industrial trouble'.8

And while dissatisfied parties could appeal to the Minister for a suspension or review of
a Wages Board determination, no such appeal existed in relation to federal awards, except
in so far as they were considered unconstitutional.9 This difference was especially pro¬
nounced in the early years of the court under Higgins' presidency. His decisions tended to
be more innovative than those reached by state Wages Boards and gained importance
because they influenced other judges and because they were not subject to appeal.10

There were also differences in jurisdiction. The awards of the federal court applied to
at least two states whereas the determinations of the Wages Boards applied only to the
state of Victoria. On the other hand, within each state, federal awards applied only to
union members in the employ of respondents to the dispute; the court had no power to
order a 'common rule' for all workers in an industry. Wages Board determinations
applied to all workers within the specified geographical area.11

Enforcement of decisions was also very different in the two systems. To police the
determinations, the Wages Boards were supported by a department of factory inspectors
who had wide powers of entry and inspection.12 The federal court had no such adminis¬
trative machinery. There were no inspectors attached to the court. Enforcement became a
matter of vigilance on the part of unionists, who were severely hampered in their surveil¬
lance by limited access to the workplace and employer records.13

By the end of the 1930s some of the differences between the federal and state systems
were considerably lessened. Wages Boards extended their jurisdiction beyond the
'sweated trades', and the establishment of the Court of Industrial Appeals in 1903 intro¬
duced an element of arbitration to the state system. Meanwhile, the conciliatory role of
the Commonwealth court was enhanced with legislative changes in 1928.14 Important
differences, however, remained. The expenses and delays associated with the federal
court had increased rather than diminished, making a federal award less attractive than
it otherwise would have been.15 Most importantly, changes to the Arbitration Court's
powers in the 1920s considerably strengthened that body's judicial role. In 1926, judges
of the court were appointed for life, giving them authority to interpret their own awards
and to determine penalties and injunctions in the event of breaches.16 Further amend¬
ments in 1928 considerably strengthened federal powers in the event of strikes and lock¬
outs. Penalties in these cases were much more severe than under state legislation on
shops and factories.17 In the industrial strife which accompanied economic downturn in
the late 1920s and 1930s, these 'penal powers' assumed grave significance for workers.
The bloody and bitter strike by waterside workers in Melbourne during 1928 resulted in
fines of £1000 being awarded against the Waterside Workers' Federation. This conviction
was the first secured under the 1928 amendments, and served as a serious warning to
other unionists contemplating federal awards or considering direct action whilst under
the jurisdiction of the federal court.18

A decision by the High Court in 1926 further decreased the attraction to unions of a


-----

federal award. Prior to this decision, unions had enjoyed the benefits of the High Court's
decision in the 1910 Whybrow case regarding the respective authority of state and fed¬
eral awards. The effect of the Whybrow decision was that whichever award prescribed
the higher wages was the one which prevailed. Unions therefore had nothing to lose and
everything to gain from an approach to the court. The 1926 decision meant that federal
awards prevailed over state awards, regardless of their terms. With the increasing con¬
servatism of the court this decision removed the attractions offered by the 1910 verdict.19
On the other hand, federal awards did have the advantage of interstate application,
something which could never be hoped for under a state system alone. It was for this
reason that industries which faced interstate competition continued to seek a federal
settlement of their grievances.

There were, of course, some enduring similarities between the federal and state struc¬
tures. Most importantly was the common illusion of the 'independent' arbiter, be he
chairman or judge. Although supposedly unconcerned in the outcome of the battle
between employers and employees, such arbiters did have a vested interest. Wage
increases, according to contemporary belief, led to increases in the cost of living. Chair¬
men and judges were consumers too, and had no more desire than the next person to pay
more for the goods and services which cushioned their existence. As well as being con¬
sumers, arbiters were also men. As such they shared in the privileges of a patriarchal
society, only one of which was relatively cheap female domestic labour. They had, there¬
fore, no desire to disrupt the gender order by innovative decisions on such things as equal
pay and female margins for skill. The self-interest of adjudicators therefore acted as a
conservative influence in both spheres, modified only by the professionalism and
altruism of individuals.20

Concern about the cost of living and the stability of sex roles was very real in the 1920s
and 1930s, amongst workers as well as judges. This period saw the movement of women
workers into non-traditional manufacturing occupations, such as the metal, rubber and
electrical industries, while the general trend toward work in white-collar jobs continued.21
This concern was often expressed at the trade union level as a move to protect the jobs of
men.22 As one unemployed man put it: 'That women should be employed and men unem¬
ployed is topsy-turvydom. It is an inversion of the natural order.'23

As the manufacturing economy faltered in the late 1920s, so this hostility to the
employment of women intensified. In Victoria the employment of girls in the bolt and
core making departments at the Sunshine Harvester Works provided a focus for union
opposition to cheaper female labour.24 As depression deepened from 1927, married
women in particular became the scapegoats. The employment of women was now seen
as a threat to the jobs of single women as well as men.25 The Labor Call, weekly labour
newspaper, described the existence of wage-earning wives as 'an anti-social policy of the
most pernicious kind'.26 Some employers responded to these protests by refusing to
employ married women, while many wives who continued to work kept their wedding
rings a guilty secret.27

The campaign against married women was both misdirected and counterproductive. It
is doubtful that the exclusion of a small number of working wives would have opened
many jobs to single women, whereas many of those who worked contributed vital


-----

money to families where, for a variety of reasons, male earnings were inadequate. As
some of the better-informed commentators pointed out, even where male 'breadwinners'
were receiving a 'family wage', there was no compulsion on men to pass on the portion
allotted as the woman's share to the wife. Some simply chose not to.28 In the long run the
stigma attached to married women's- paid work affected employers as well as workers
of both sexes. The slow recovery of the economy from 1931 was led by manufacturing
industries, especially 'women's industries' such as clothing, boots and textiles.29 By the
middle of the decade these industries had absorbed the available female labour and were
beginning to experience shortages. The employment of married women would have
been one way of overcoming this shortage, but there was no rush of wives anxious to
re-enter the factories (see Chapter Eight). Finally, as the case of the boot trade shows,
shortages of female labour in sections of an industry could slow down the entire pro¬
duction process. Had there been more women workers, it would have been possible to
employ more men in the other sections which worked in conjunction with the women's
departments.

The vilification of women's paid work in general (as distinct from that of working
wives) was similarly misguided. As feminist investigators have pointed out, the apparent
'feminisation' of industry was due to lower levels of unemployment in 'women's
industries'. Rather than women 'taking men's jobs', the labour market remained as
rigidly sex-segregated as ever.30 And while many workers of both sexes railed against
those considered less deserving of employment, employers reaped the benefits of labour
disunity. Individual women in the late 1920s and 1930s exhorted the workers to take a
united stand against attacks on their wages and conditions, but their pleas fell on deaf
ears.31 Divided by sex, ethnicity and marital status, the working class in general was ill
equipped to deal with the challenges presented by the depression. The nature of the chal¬
lenge and the responses of the workers varied, however, from industry to industry, as we
shall see in the chapters which follow.

 Diplomacy and Guerilla Warfare: The Clothing Industries, 1919-1939

In August 1922, almost 2000 clothing workers from Melbourne's dressmaking, shirt,
underclothing and millinery firms gathered in the Trades Hall to discuss reductions in
their rates of pay. Not since the agitation against sweating in the 1890s had there been
such a large and enthusiastic gathering in the trade.1 But apart from the scale of the
agitation, the situation had little in common with the protest meetings of the 1890s. In
the two decades which had elapsed, the world of the clothing worker had changed dra¬
matically. In place of the unregulated workplace of the 1890s was the whole machinery
of Wages Boards and Arbitration Court. And while the female clothing worker of the
nineteenth century was at the employer's mercy in an overcrowded labour market, the
early 1920s saw this situation reversed. Girls leaving school in the 1920s had wider
options than their mothers and grandmothers, and many chose 'to go into lolly factories
or jam factories or become stenographers' rather than follow the sewing trades.2 The
rapid expansion of textile factories after the war attracted many girls, especially as the
starting pay was twice as much as that paid to beginners in the clothing trades.3 The
early 1920s were also prosperous ones for clothing manufacturers, with comparatively
steady demand for their products. Their only serious problem was the shortage of skilled
female labour.4

The combination of these factors meant that the outcome of the 1922 meeting was also
very different. The reductions themselves had been introduced in accordance with
adjustments in the consumer price index, under the authority of the arbitration award.
The unanimous resolution to resist these cuts had a complex result in terms of actual
strategy. The union was bound to appeal to the court and in the meantime the workers
were unable to strike. But this did not eliminate resistance. On the contrary, workers car¬
ried out an informal campaign against employers who reduced pay rates. With clothing


-----

manufacturers short of suitable female labour, it was an easy matter for individual
workers to find alternative employment. What happened was in effect a boycott of all
cut-rate employers. These tactics had in fact been in operation in the tailoring section
since February of 1922 and had been very successful. The few cases in which opposition
did erupt into actual stoppages were quickly dealt with by the union officials, who
advised the strikers to return to work and give in their notices.5 In this way general
reductions were prevented and the workers adhered to the letter, if not the spirit, of the
arbitration law.6 Some employers, at the instigation of the Victorian Chamber of Manu¬
factures, attempted to stop the practice by compiling a black list of employees but the
strategy foundered on disunity in their ranks.7 These employers, in the past so fond of
invoking the inviolability of the laws of the market, were forced to submit to the
consequences of a labour shortage.

This episode highlights several important aspects of industrial relations in the clothing
industry during this period. Firstly, it shows that, given the possibility of success, clothing
workers could be both militant and effective in their resistance to employers. Their
frequent changes of employment must be seen in this context as a resistance strategy, not
as a shirking of conflict as Beverley Kingston has argued.8 Secondly, the inter-war years
saw the consolidation of the power of the officials within the Clothing Trades Union. The
officials' analysis of the industrial situation and their assessment of appropriate strategies
prevailed. As Carter himself observed: 'The influence that permeates this industry as far
as the individuals who are officers of the Union is concerned is such that the employees
are guided by their advice.'9 The existence of what Wallis called the 'foreign element' also
predisposed the officials to invoke the authority of the state rather than to attempt
thorough shopfloor organisation.10

By the 1920s the officials were firmly committed to arbitration rather than direct
action as the way to improve wages and conditions.11 They reasoned that the preponder¬
ance of women in the union meant that direct action would not be effective.12 Arbi¬
tration was costly, but there were large numbers employed in the industry; even though
just over half were unionists, their contributions ensured a comparatively healthy bank
balance.13 The officials devoted their energies to preparing arbitration cases, recruiting
new members and collecting contributions in order to finance their activities. They took
pains not to antagonise employers so that they could continue this work on factory prem¬
ises during working hours. By the mid-1920s members recalled nostalgically the 'old
days' when officials used to give stirring speeches at factories.14 As May Francis com¬
plained, 'there was too much diplomacy' on the part of organisers.15

This concentration of union effort on arbitration took its toll of both officials and
members. In the heady days of 1922-23 the 'guerilla war' against reductions had united
all in a spirit of comradeship, mass meetings ending with enthusiastic singing of 'Soli¬
darity Forever'.16 By contrast, the painstaking work of preparing arbitration cases
seemed very dull. Attendance at meetings dropped off and several times did not even
provide a quorum. Carter confessed that he 'felt stale for the want of something to do'.
He went on to say that the union's efforts had become too stereotyped. 'It was losing its
soul and was too straight laced .. . The whole thing was being professionalised and it
seemed to be all a question of jobs.'17


-----

And as the reliance on arbitration reinforced the dominance of the officials within the
union, so too did it reinforce the ascendancy of men over women. Female workers
especially felt alienated by the whole process of courts, judges and cross-examinations.
No doubt many men would also have been overawed by the court's formality and
procedures, but women experienced added discomfort because of the maleness of the
environment. The experience of being interrogated about one's annual underwear
requirements by a group of men was one which few women could face with equa¬
nimity.18 The world of the court was a man's world, better left to the talents of the
male officials.

The reliance on arbitration also reinforced this position in more subtle ways. Appeals
to the court were very expensive affairs, so that the union's financial position assumed
great importance. This affected gender relations in the union in two ways. Firstly, as each
male member paid twice as much in dues as the average woman it made more economic
sense to concentrate the union's organising efforts on the male sections, that is, men's
and boys' order and ready-made clothing. The mass of female workers employed in
dressmaking, whitework, underclothing, millinery and shirt factories were given lowest
priority.19 This led to very uneven union coverage. At Myers, for instance, the tailoring
workroom was almost 100 per cent union while at the same time most of Myers' other
workrooms were almost 100 per cent non-union.20 Secondly, the emphasis on recruiting
members and collecting dues led to a quest for quantity rather than quality in union
organisation. Organisers were evaluated on this basis. This in turn led indirectly to the
replacement of the only woman organiser with a young man in 1923, on the grounds
that Whitford was not as cost-effective as a man.21

The decision to give priority to the No. 1 Section, as the men's and boys' section was
called, coincided with a decline in female representation on the union executive. After
the war the union embraced several allied trades, namely umbrella making, straw hats,
fur work, dyeing and cleaning, and examining. All of these sections were represented on
the executive by men. The brief balance of the sexes which had been achieved in 1917
was upset, and for the 1920s and 1930s men outnumbered women by at least three to
two. After the resignation of May Brodney (formerly May Francis) in 1927 the few
women who remained on the executive presented little challenge to the hegemony of the
male officials.22

By the late 1920s the arbitration system had helped men within the Clothing Trades
Union assume a disproportionate amount of power and influence. Indeed, despite the
majority of female membership the officials persisted in seeing it as a masculine concern.
Strong union shops were said to be 'virile', while Carter claimed that the union's acqui¬
escence in wage reductions 'would be tantamount to denying their own man-hood'.23
When enthusiasm for the cause waned in the mid-1920s, he lamented the lack of 'young
men with an ideal and willing to express it' to revive the fighting spirit.24 It was as
though the women members were invisible. Figures 12 and 13, although from a later
period, capture this perception of the movement in the 1920s and 1930s. Note the hand¬
some young organiser in Figure 12 enticing the young woman unionist, watched
benevolently by the fatherly figures of the secretaries. Indeed, Wallis liked to describe
himself as 'a sort of secular Father Confessor' to the members.25

the Voice of the Clothing Trades Union, vol. 1, no. 7, Autumn 1948.

A third point arising out of the 1922 resistance relates to the attitude of the employers.
The attempt to blackball workers leaving their employers without a written certificate of
release originated in the Chamber of Manufactures. As the union journal pointed out, the
VCM had been captured by 'extremists'.26 Their policies were not supported by the
majority of clothing manufacturers, as the failure of the counter-boycott indicates. The
union was quick to exploit these differences within the employers' camp. The choice of
allies was not difficult, given the militantly anti-union stance of employers such as James
Law. Law's stance had important repercussions in the industry. He was president of the
Clothing Trades Section of the Chamber of Manufactures at the time of the reductions. In
the mid-1920s he led a determined opposition by some employers to the union,
forbidding officials to enter their factories and sacking unionists. Only the intervention of
the Arbitration Court guaranteed officials rights of entry. Shirt manufacturers in particu¬
lar continued their opposition throughout the 1930s.27

In addition to this organised opposition was the personal example Law offered. He
strenuously opposed union influence within his own factory. His formula for industrial
relations was impressively effective. Dining rooms, lunchtime entertainment, recreation
rooms and a chatty company newspaper complemented Law's paternalistic style to


-----

undermine any attempt by the union to recruit amongst his workers.28 The union's
dismal failure to counter this approach no doubt contributed to the diplomacy shown to
other employers: had others been as hostile as Law, the union would have been in a very
sorry state. Pelaco was not alone in its provision of such facilities; industrial 'welfare
schemes' gained in popularity in the 1920s and were most popular amongst manufac¬
turers of wearing apparel. Nevertheless, such firms remained a small minority.29

13 Another graphic illustration of the marginalisation of women within the Clothing Trades Union.
Propaganda drawn from a predominantly male union movement was used uncritically in the union’s
journal where its appeal in a largely women's industry must have been very limited. This appeal
appeared on the front page of the Australian Clothing Trades Journal, November 1941.

In summary, then, relations between workers and employers in the 1920s were
focused on the federal Arbitration Court where the union mounted two major cases, one
in 1922 and the other in 1927. Outside the court the union concentrated its efforts on
recruiting members whilst not antagonising employers. Collective direct action in
support of pay and conditions was discouraged. At the same time, individual workers
were able to take advantage of their relative scarcity to bargain with employers. Lack
of unity amongst employers ensured that such bargaining usually worked to the
employees' advantage.

With the downswing in the clothing trade from 1927, the situation began to change.
The growth of contracting and outwork presented new problems to both the union
officials and those employers being undercut.30 Despite the existence of both state Wages
Boards and federal arbitration awards, controlling cut-rate outwork was by no means an
easy matter. The first difficulty was in relation to administration and policing of the two
sets of legislation. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court had no officers of its own to
police its awards, so that in practice this was left to the union officials. Theirs was a diffi¬
cult task. They had to negotiate the labyrinth of Melbourne's backyard and fly-by-night
factories, and faced legal restrictions on their right to enter factory premises to inspect for
breaches of the award. Hostility by some employers and lack of co-operation from
employees made their task unpleasant and on occasions dangerous. The union officials
found that young girls and recent immigrants were particularly uncooperative in giving
evidence about rates of pay. Ignorance and fear made both groups of workers particu¬
larly susceptible to exploitation. Officials often encountered abuse from employers, and
on one occasion Wallis was punched in the face.31 Their powers to eliminate sweating
were further restricted by the fact that, for much of this period, their jurisdiction
extended only to union members in the employ of manufacturers who were respondents
to the award. In 1936 almost half of Victoria's 1000 or so registered clothing factories
were small and employed non-union labour and, as such, came under the jurisdiction of
the state Department of Labour. These small factories together employed over 8000 of
the state's 20,613 clothing workers.32

The state Department of Labour was even less well equipped to police the Shops and
Factories Act. In the 1930s its inspectors had to police the provisions of approximately
180 Wages Board determinations in over 12,000 factories. As a campaign against sweat¬
ing noted in the 1930s, the Factories Department was 'utterly understaffed and for this
reason entirely ineffective'.33 Low piecework rates, 'stretch-out' of tasks, non-payment of
overtime and excessive overtime were matters which remained undetected after the per¬
functory questioning of employees (often in the presence of employers) which usually
passed for factory inspection.34 Many employers took advantage of this situation and
made it a rule not to employ unionists so that they would continue exclusively under
state, rather than federal authority.35

The union's response to these difficulties was to intensify its policy of using the
arbitration system to defend working standards. In the first instance it sought and won
the court's recognition that officers of the union were to be regarded as officers of the
court for the purposes of policing arbitration awards.36 The years of playing the part of
the moderate, 'reasonable' union had borne fruit. The next target was to enable the union


-----

to sue employers who breached awards and to compel workers to give sworn evidence
regarding their wages. This required an -award for compulsory unionism. Again, the
union was successful, the award for compulsory union membership for female clothing
workers being granted in 1931. When contractors still evaded prosecution by challenging
the definition of themselves as employers, the union pressed the court to make the prin¬
cipal employer, that is, the one who issued the original contract, responsible for the wages
and conditions under which the work was carried out. Judge Drake-Brockman also
agreed to this claim after a special hearing on outwork in 1937.37

It seemed the union's policy of trusting to the 'generosity of Judge Drake-Brockman'
had paid off.38 But as the 1930s progressed it became increasingly apparent that the
policy was only partially successful. Even when breaches of the awards and determi¬
nations were discovered, legal loopholes and High Court challenges made successful
prosecution of sweaters a most difficult task. Numerous alterations to the outwork pro¬
visions in the both federal and state legislation in the period 1928-39 failed to plug these
loopholes. Rather, the problems increased throughout the 1930s and in some cases
attempted reforms only exacerbated the difficulties. For example, the 1928 award tried
to reduce the exploitation of homeworkers by forbidding respondents to employ
outworkers directly. The respondent was, however, allowed to enter into a contract with
a non-respondent to have work done outside the respondent's factory. This caused a
short-term fall in work being given to individual outworkers and an immediate increase
in the number of small 'backyard' factories operated by contractors. This provision in fact
seems to have exacerbated the problem by involving middlemen and removing the
responsibility of the principal employer.39

Not only was the policy ineffective in providing the legal protection which officials
hoped for, but it also became obvious that relying on arbitration had unforeseen costs for
the workers. The emphasis on recruiting members and piling up dues had created a
certain amount of cynicism and alienation amongst workers, especially the women. This
sense of alienation was observed by an anonymous unionist in 1938. Although she
expected some action on a case of underpayment at her workplace, she pointed out that
most of her fellow machinists were sceptical: 'The girls at the factory say all the union
worries about is that you pay Mr. Wilson your contributions.'40

The increasing employment of European migrants, particularly Italians, Poles and
Yugoslavs, made the task of achieving close relations between organisers and workers
even more difficult, while evidence of anti-Semitism on Wallis' part cannot have
improved the union's relationship with Jewish workers.41 In addition to the generally low
priority given to women members, several specific instances of neglect no doubt contrib¬
uted to women's suspicions of the male officials. The first episode occurred in 1920,
when the union was forced to negotiate with the employers for an increase in wages to
cover inflation. The compromise reached on this occasion was that 'the women should
only get half the increase that the men got', as Carter put it. This represented a relative
decline in wages for the women, as they had been awarded 57 per cent of the male rate
by Higgins in the previous year.42

The other cause of dissatisfaction was the rather half-hearted way in which the men
prosecuted the union's claim for equal pay for the sexes. Despite the strenuous efforts of


-----

Muriel Heagney and a number of women in the industry to prepare cases for federal
arbitration in 1922 and 1927, their claims were not treated seriously by the court. This is
hardly surprising, since the union officials themselves were not convinced of the justice
or viability of the proposal. Carter, who was in charge of the union case, doubted the jus¬
tice of claiming equal pay for workers who remained in the industry 'for only seven
years', and also believed that to introduce the scheme would require a prohibitive tariff in
order to maintain the competitiveness of Australia's clothing industry.43 The consistent
refusal of the union to grant equal pay to its woman organiser and female clerks must
also have created doubts about the sincerity of the union's own equal-pay claims.44

By 1935 even the officials were becoming concerned at the level of disillusionment. In
December of that year it mounted a campaign to combat sweating in the Brunswick fac¬
tories. Significantly, it employed the services of a woman, Muriel Heagney, to assist its
own male organiser, Ted Smith.45 Both found that, apart from the hostility of employers,
the 'greatest obstacle' in enrolling new members arose in relation to fears about arrears of
dues and prosecutions by the union to recover these. 'The intrusion of the policeman into
Union affairs', Heagney reported, had had 'a lasting and baneful effect' on the women.46

Heagney also pointed out that formal meeting procedures had a 'very stultifying effect
on people of all ages and particularly on young women'. She suggested instead that
frequent informal meetings and social gatherings be organised amongst Brunswick
workers to 'create a medium for greater co-operation between the Union officials and the
workers in the various factories'. She also urged the appointment of a woman organiser,
as 'there was a general consensus of opinion that it was helpful to have a woman organ¬
iser to discuss phases of women's conditions not adequately and freely discussed in the
routine of formal Union work'.47 The latter suggestion was ignored. Indeed, Wallis still
espoused the belief that 'most women in industry preferred to work for men and to have
men as their industrial organisers'.48

Meanwhile, there were signs of serious discontent in Melbourne's largest men's cloth¬
ing factories. Traditionally the backbone of the union, the women in these factories chose
the temporary absence of Secretary Wallis from the state as an occasion for a strike
against changes to the process of machining trousers. The strike involved 150 women at
Ellinson Brothers', Frieze Brothers' and Sackville's. Previous to the dispute, machinists
made trousers almost wholly throughout with the exception of buttonholes, button loops
and bands which were made on separate patent machines. An overlocking machine had
recently been introduced which did the side seam in the leg, seat seam and crutch. The
proprietors of these three firms proposed to use these overlocking machines in conjunc¬
tion with a team system comprising one journeywoman and two improvers. Instead of
machining the trousers throughout, the work was to be subdivided into four or five oper¬
ations, depending on the style of the bands. A meeting of the machinists unanimously
resolved to oppose the new system on the grounds:

1. That it will speed them up and increase their output.
2. That their earnings will be lessened.

3. That the juveniles will not be taught all sections of trousers.
4. That being part of a system each one is bound by the speed set by the team with an inevitable
injury to their health.49


-----

Clearly, their main concern was that the new method was a form of increased
exploitation.

The Militant Minority Movement of the Communist Party was anxious to extend the
strike and set up relief and propaganda committees to deal with its management, but the
union officials were just as anxious to prevent a communist ascendancy in the factories.50
Wallis rushed back from Tasmania and set up shop committees of his own, and thus
assumed control of the strike.51 After a protracted dispute lasting several months, he per¬
suaded the women to modify their demands and accept some innovation, providing their
earnings did not fall.52 There was no guarantee against speeding-up, the first objection
stated by the strikers.

The outcome of this dispute indicates several significant developments in the union's
position since 1922. The official position was still one of active encouragement of more
'efficient' methods of production. The union had always allied itself to the large-scale
manufacturer because it equated large-scale production with better pay and conditions.
As Carter told the Arbitration Court in 1927, 'it suits us to have the industry in more or
less the control of the bigger people'.53 Big factories were easier to organise and police
than the fly-by-night backyard operator. With the re-emergence of outwork in the late
1920s, this alliance became even more important. But support of big industry also
implied an acceptance of mass production methods. Indeed, Wallis and Carter were at
pains to emphasise the union's support for these more 'rational' methods.54

By the 1920s, however, the consequences of this policy were becoming apparent. The
early 1920s saw an increasing conviction within the union that the workers were
becoming 'the victims of the Juggernaut of industry', to use Higgins' colourful phrase.55
From its aggressive stance in 1919, demanding a share in the higher profits, the union
retreated somewhat in the face of greater experience with the new methods. It had
become clear that the employers not only wished to cheapen production by increasing
output through subdivision, but that they desired to reduce costs even further by elimin¬
ating margins for skill and speeding up the workers. Instead of talking about workers
sharing in increased profits, the union's emphasis shifted to insisting that it was not fair
that employers reaped greater profits at the expense of the workers.56

This disillusionment with the employers' sense of justice was even more evident in the
1927 arbitration hearing. It was also obvious that more workers were dissatisfied with
the effects of the new methods. They complained about the bad effects that the noise,
speed and monotony had on their health.57 The union was also less enthusiastic about
the new methods, realising that the subdivision of labour deskilled workers and made
them more susceptible to unemployment and wage reductions. The claim for compulsory
apprenticeship with apprentices being taught all sections of the 'craft' was the union's
attempt to accommodate subdivision. Like the bootmakers, they hoped this broad-based
training would give workers greater flexibility in the labour market and also support the
claim that their work was specialised rather than fragmented.58

Wallis' position on shorter hours encouraging 'industrial efficiency' had changed rad¬
ically between 1919 and 1935 in the light of this experience. By 1935 he admitted that
shorter hours usually led to speeding up rather than genuinely 'labour-saving' methods,
so that 'the benefit to the workers individually and collectively will be again annulled'.59


-----

But the union was still not prepared to change its official stance regarding innovations in
production. It still regarded scientific management as the lesser of two evils, the alterna¬
tive being sweated outwork. What did change was the way in which the officials justified
their stance to their members. Wallis, in his appeal to the strikers in 1935, emphasised
the futility of their opposition to the team system: 'In every industry, everywhere, no
union or strike has been able to prevent new methods and machines ... and . .. that if
employees struck against acceptance of the new method of manufacture and the new
machines they would not have one chance in a hundred of preventing new methods.'60
The only hope, he argued, was to prevent the worst features of the system from being
introduced and to keep up the price of labour.

The difference in attitudes on this issue between the officials and the machinists is evi¬
dence of the increasing distance between them. Both groups objected to the increased
exploitation of the changed methods, but they each had different criteria of what exploi¬
tation involved. For the women, decreased earnings were an important factor but sec¬
ondary to the decreased quality of the work experience and consequent detrimental
effects on the workers' health. The officials tended to see the issue purely in terms of
earnings. This difference arose out of the two groups' different experiences of work.
Neither Carter nor Wallis had worked at the trade since before the war. Their experience
of work even in those days did not coincide with that of the female workers. An order
tailor and cutter respectively, neither experienced the pressures of working as machinists.
As subdivision and mechanisation increased in the late 1920s and 1930s, so too did the
disparity between these experiences. This was also true for the majority of male union¬
ists who supported Carter and Wallis. Even those who worked in factories which
employed subdivision of labour usually did so as supervisors in charge of female
operatives.61

This distance between the officials and the female members was also reflected in the
policy of the union in regard to outwork. The union's aim was to abolish the practice
altogether.62 The attractions of such a policy were obvious enough. Outworkers were no
easier to organise in the 1930s than they had been in the 1890s, and policing their con¬
ditions seemed impossible. But whereas such a policy may have succeeded with a male
workforce (as indeed it had in the boot trade in 1884) it was doomed to failure in the
clothing trade. Too many women, tied to the home by their domestic responsibilities,
were prepared to sabotage any such attempt to remove their livelihood.63

While the 1935 strike highlighted these aspects of the union's relationship to the
workers, it also alerted the officials to significant problems with their policy regarding
arbitration. Reviewing the history of the clothing trades awards at a national conference
of the union in 1937, one of the organisers observed that the policy of industrial peace
they had pursued seemed to have backfired. Referring to the trouser machinists' strike
in 1935, organiser Maurice Callard recalled that in that instance 'the girls struck
and the bosses rushed around'. He contrasted the effectiveness of militancy with
the 'diplomatic' policy pursued by the union, saying that 'if he, as an Organiser,
walked into the shop he would be arguing for six months'. And, as he pointed out,
the 'position had the same effect upon a Judge or Court: if the industry jumped out they
took notice'.64


-----

In their defence the officials maintained that they lacked an army to carry on a war
against the bosses. They 'had portions of an army, however, and could carry on guerilla
warfare'.65 This reassessment prompted a more militant spirit. 'Comrade' Wallis told a
general meeting of the Victorian branch in 1940 that he believed the clothing workers
had been 'penalised' because of their 'allegiance to constitutional methods'. They had
received no increases in margins for skill since 1928, whereas skilled workers in other,
more 'militant', industries had been given quite considerable increases.66 The late 1930s
saw a revival of union organisation directed at building rank-and-file enthusiasm. Social
gatherings, sporting competitions and factory addresses once more became a feature of
union activity.67 By 1937 this policy was showing signs of success, and young people
began to take an active interest in the union's affairs for the first time since the agitation
of 1922. The experience of organising campaigns revived the spirits of organisers like
Ted Smith, who had the chance to 'penetrate many aspects of organisation which are not
encountered in the ordinary course of work for the Union'. By this he meant that he
devoted special attention to examining 'the state of affairs in the factories, the psy¬
chology of the employers and employees, their reactions to our Union, sympathetically
or otherwise'.68 The close of the decade thus saw a spirit of defiance in the union not
seen since the early 1920s.

How far did this 'peace', punctuated by sporadic outbreaks of rebellion, affect the
nature of work in the inter-war period? At the most general level it is clear that the
union's support for arbitration and the organising priorities which this entailed
reinforced existing trends in relation to the work process. Those sections which were
already subject to substantial subdivision, such as shirts, continued to lead the field in
relation to innovative work processes. The failure of the union to organise these sections
and the unwillingness of the court to flout trade customs regarding apprenticeships com¬
bined to give manufacturers a free hand. After the war, James Law continued his inno¬
vations, building on his time-and-motion studies to 'rationalise' every aspect of his
factory. In general terms, as he put it, this meant adopting the method of 'placing the
management in the hands of those who are capable of managing, and putting the work
in the hands of those who are capable of doing the work'.69 Juveniles, it seems, were
capable of doing a large part of this executive work where 'every operation has been ren¬
dered fool-proof'. Over 60 per cent of female workers were under twenty-one years of
age and almost one-third of these were under eighteen.70 Law made no apologies for his
preference for young girls. He maintained that in most cases industrial employment was
seen by girls as a stepping stone to matrimony. 'The present-day girl', he argued, 'is look¬
ing for work where she can get the most money in the quickest time.' Furthermore, he
added, 'the man who is able to put his industry into such a position as will cope with that
demand by the girls is the one, I think, who is best able to achieve satisfactory results'.71
He managed this task by putting juveniles on piece rates almost from the outset, instead
of putting them on improvers' wages, which were fixed according to age, until they
reached twenty-one. Because the work was so subdivided, workers could become pro¬
ficient in a matter of months. Thereafter as juniors they usually earned more on
piecework than on the relevant wage for their age. Compared to a journeywoman's
earnings, however, their earnings were not so impressive, which accounts in part for the


-----

high turnover and preponderance of juveniles.72 This system of putting juniors
on piece rates had the added advantage of circumventing the restrictions on the
employment of juveniles, since pieceworkers were counted as adults whatever their age.
It also may account for the contradictory image Pelaco has maintained of paying good
money yet being a sweatshop.

The keys to Law's system remained the separation of conception and execution and
the location of the 'right' person to perform each. By the end of the war the sewing of
garments was already minutely subdivided so that the 1920s saw only an extension of
this principle. The big change occurred in the cutting department, where even the
cutter's work was subject to time-and-motion studies and specific instruction from 'the
planning department'. At the Pelaco factory in the late 1920s the most economical layout
for any pattern was calculated not by the cutter but by the head draughtsman in the
planning department. The cloth was then carried on lifting trucks operated by boys and
was laid on tables where the pattern was marked by a perforating machine operated by
girls. After a boy had chalked the perforations, the cutter simply cut through the layers
with an electric cutting machine.73

A further innovation in this period was in the 'scientific' approach to personnel selec¬
tion. As Law explained, finding the right person for the job was no longer simply a
matter of trial and error:

Our employment girl downstairs has been well taught and has read a great deal of psychology, and
knows the type of individual who would fit the different jobs . .. She knows by looking at a girl's
head and hands, the shape of her mouth, eyes, etc., and can tell to a certain extent what any girl is
particularly useful for.74

Industrial psychology (or should it be industrial phrenology?) had made its appearance
on the Victorian scene.

But whereas industrial relations in the shirt industry, and arbitration awards for this
section, provided little impediment to productive innovation, the reverse was true of the
manufacture of men's and boys' clothing. Indentures which insisted on apprentices being
taught all parts of a garment, and limitations on the number of apprentices which could
be employed, discouraged innovations which relied on untrained juvenile labour. Per¬
haps more importantly, concentration of union effort on organising this section made the
militant resistance, such as that which occurred in 1935, both more likely to occur and
more likely to succeed.

The court's award for equal pay on pressing, cutting and dress coats also discouraged
subdivision of these occupations in the tailoring section, particularly in the latter two.
Equal pay removed the incentive to subdivide work where manufacturers hoped to use
this in conjunction with quickly trained, cheap female labour. In all sections of the trade
Law's cutting methods stood out as the only chink in the armour of the craftsman cutter.
By 1938 others had joined the assault, seeking to separate the tasks of marking in and
cutting out, but before World War II the move had made little impression on the craft
as a whole.75

On the other hand, the court's failure to award margins commensurate with the skill of
many female workers doing 'women's work' may have deterred innovation in sections


-----

like dressmaking: the rates being paid were so low that further cheapening of labour by
subdivision was of less obvious advantage than if the undivided work had been paid for
at male craft rates.

The court affected the shirt industry in a similarly negative fashion. By not restricting
the employment of juveniles or providing for craft apprenticeships, it gave free rein to
the shirt manufacturers.

Similarly, the failure of arbitration awards to control contracting had led to exploitation
of workers in these factories and the lowering of standards for others in respondent fac¬
tories. Most importantly, the use of arbitration awards to control excessive tasks and cut¬
ting of piece rates proved futile. The only effective answer to these practices was
shopfloor resistance; the poorly organised dress and shirt sections which had been
unable to mount such resistance in the past continued to suffer the greatest exploitation
despite the arbitration system.

In general, federal arbitration reinforced existing trends in the clothing trade. Its
awards affected the nature of work by defining the options available to employers, but
these definitions often amounted to a formalisation of existing customs and practices
within the trade. Where radical departures were attempted, such as in the control of out¬
work, they were not very successful in achieving significant modifications.

More important in determining the nature of work processes was the ongoing limi¬
tation of the Australian market for clothing. Employers were alert to the latest methods
and developments in use overseas, but the more restricted nature of the local market
often made these methods impractical.76

Technological developments in this period were also important in both encouraging
and limiting innovation in methods of work. The 1920s saw the development of a greater
variety of specialist machines and an improvement in existing models. The new
machines performed many of the old hand operations quickly and efficiently. Felling,
tacking, padding, basting and seaming could all now be done mechanically, and even
shank buttons could be sewn on by machine. Embroidery machines replaced hand
labour while machines to perform tubular work, such as sleeve and trouser felling, were
also developed. Patent machines which made hip pockets and trouser loops, and special
attachments to assist with feeding these machines, reduced the time spent adjusting cloth
prior to sewing. To some extent these eliminated the most difficult part of the work: guid¬
ing material through the machine at a very fast pace.77 The demand for these special
machines was such that one company, the Union Special Machine Company, devoted the
whole of its operation prior to the mid-1930s to developing improved models.78 In some
cases, improvements on older models produced dramatic increases in output. For
example, buttonhole machines in use in 1920 could do 800 buttonholes per day; fifteen
years later a good operator on the Reece trouser buttonhole machine could do 4000 in
one day.79 Even the straight sewer was improved, with speeds increased from 3500 to
5000 stitches per minute. Improved gearing made these speeds instantly available to the
operative.80 The 1930s also saw the limited introduction of sewing machines powered by
individual motors.81 But by the mid-1930s the machinery manufacturers recognised that
the sewing machine had reached its maximum practical speed because higher speeds
were inclined to break both operators and cotton. As one manufacturer put it, 'speeds


-----

above a reasonable limit lose their efficiency, due to the undue strain of concentration by
the operator, and the difficulty in obtaining at reasonable cost cottons that will stand
passing through the machines at such speeds'.82

The relationship between sewing machine technology and methods of work is nicely
illustrated by ready-made tailoring. Ready-made tailoring factories had divided the work
to some extent since the turn of the century. This was especially so with trouser-making,
where pockets, bands and linings were prepared separately, and hemming, buttonholing
and button-sewing were performed by different workers. The new patent machines
reinforced the subdivision of many preparatory and finishing tasks, but the straight
sewing usually remained in the hands of the one machinist who sewed the garment
throughout. This situation began to change only in 1935 when new overlocking
machines prompted employers to experiment with subdivision of the actual making.83

As the case of trouser-making also shows, however, the availability of technology did
not determine methods of work in any mechanistic sense: how it was applied depended
very much on the decisions of employers and the response of employees. And the rela¬
tive bargaining power of capital and labour was most immediately determined by the
labour market. The Arbitration Court did mediate this relationship to some extent, but
only in minor ways. In the final analysis, the court reflected the contours of the labour
market. And in the fiercely competitive 1930s, few workers had cause to celebrate the
benefits of the system in which their union had put its trust.

 The Cinderella of the Skilled Trades: The Boot Industry, 1911-1939

Looking back over the history of the Boot Trade Union Federation in 1939, Jim Maloney,
secretary of the New South Wales branch, characterised the dominant strategy of the
union before 1936 as one of 'peace at any price'.1 This chapter will focus on the way in
which this peace was achieved and the consequences of this bargain for all concerned.

Both parties to the 1909 federal arbitration award emerged from the case very much
the poorer. The cost of financing advocates and witnesses amounted to about £3000 for
each side.2 In addition to the monetary expense was the time and energy expended on
preparing the case. And at the end of it all the Arbitration Court could not guarantee
uniformity, since the award applied only to the 38 respondents, leaving a further 256
manufacturers outside its jurisdiction.3 Chastened by the experience, both employers and
workers were receptive to any scheme which promised a cheaper and more effective
solution to the problem of settling industrial differences.4

The Round Table Conference had much to recommend it. Representatives from
employers and the union in each state met in interstate conferences and negotiated
agreements on wages and conditions. The representatives then returned home and
ensured that the agreement was embodied in the award of each state wage-fixing tri¬
bunal.5 In some cases the agreement was also made a consent award of the federal court.
This arrangement was cheaper, quicker and more effective than arbitration. Instead of
£3000 in costs, each side could expect to pay about £500 per conference.6 There was no
need to worry about the delays attendant on bringing the case to court, nor the time
taken with hearing cases and preparing judgements. By embodying the agreement under
state legislation, the officers of the particular government labour departments were
responsible for its enforcement. Furthermore, the agreement applied to all employers, not
only those named as respondents. Finally, each side still had the option of an appeal to


-----

the court should conferences prove abortive in settling differences. In theory, at least,
Round Table Conferences represented the partnership of capital, labour and the state,
working in the interests of peace, prosperity and justice for all.

The reality did not always measure up to this lofty scheme for industrial consensus. The
'spirit of sweet reasonableness' on numerous occasions proved unable to reconcile the
diverse interests and tempers of the various parties.7 Meanwhile, the personalities and
policies of the arbitration bench, rather than offering neutral adjudication, at various times
seemed to hold out greater hope for one side or the other. Nor did the uniformity of con¬
ditions offered by conference lay to rest the 'bitter feeling which ... existed between differ¬
ent employers'.8 The possibility of securing a separate state determination in order to gain
an advantage over rival interstate manufacturers was sometimes too tantalising for certain
employers. Finally, there were always those in both camps who preferred direct action to
either conciliation or arbitration. The peace was at best an uneasy one.

The first decade of conferences saw the arrangement working smoothly with apparent
satisfaction to all concerned. The federal award came into operation in 1910 and the sub¬
sequent years to 1920 were ones of almost general prosperity for the boot trade.Victorian
manufacturers in particular did well out of the boot boom which accompanied Aus¬
tralia's involvement in the 1914-18 war, accounting for about 60 per cent of Australia's
total production. Between 1913 and 1923 the number of factories doubled and the value
of plant and equipment increased threefold, while production of boots and shoes
increased by almost 40 per cent.9

But the onset of the post-war recession in 1920 exposed the fragility of this consen¬
sus.10 A strong rank-and-file agitation developed in Victorian boot factories to reduce the
working week from 48 to 44 hours or less in order to offset the growing unemployment
in the trade.11 At the same time, New South Wales employers were forced to increase
their rates above those decreed by the interstate agreement because of an award of the
state arbitration court.12 Victorian manufacturers thus had an advantage over their rivals
in Sydney and, even though they conceded the 44-hour week in 1921, the minimum
hourly rate in Victoria was still less than that paid in New South Wales. The interstate
conference in March 1921 agreed on a formula to restore uniformity to the trade.13

An active section of the Victorian manufacturers, however, was reluctant to concede
their advantage and rejected the conference's decision, resolving in future to settle their
differences in the Victorian Wages Board. This move was designed to preserve their edge
over New South Wales for at least another six months, as the Wages Board would not
normally be convened without their co-operation before that time had elapsed.14 The
plan backfired. Representatives from the union and the majority of the large employers
(including two of their Wages Board delegates) persuaded the Minister for Labour to con¬
vene the board immediately, that is, before any change in the delegates was possible.15
The outcome was not unexpected. T. Y. Harkness and Daniel Hellings, the-two
employers' delegates who had supported the union's request for the board to be con¬
vened, voted with the workers to incorporate the terms of the conference agreement in
the new determination.16

The crisis was not yet over. A narrow majority of the Manufacturers' Associa¬
tion voted to replace Hellings and Harkness on the reconstituted board and their


-----

recommendation was accepted by the Minister despite a petition against this change
signed by twenty-five major employers who between them employed about 3000 of the
11,700 Victorian boot workers.17 The new delegates approached the board with drastic
proposals for altering the determination. This move also failed as a large meeting of the
Manufacturers' Association narrowly rejected the proposals and ordered the delegates to
adjourn the board indefinitely.18

Defeated in their own organisation, the more militant manufacturers were forced to
accept a return to the Round Table. Between 1923 and 1931 these conferences again
functioned more or less smoothly, with decisions generally following precedents set in
the federal court.19 The deepening of the economic depression in 1931, however, saw a
revival of agitation by the militant section of manufacturers, who this time carried a
majority of their fellows with them in withdrawing from the federal agreement.20 In
returning to the Victorian Wages Board they hoped to secure more favourable terms than
those their Sydney competitors could obtain under the aegis of the Lang government.21
Again their attempt was thwarted, this time by the union's threat to bring the case before
the federal court. Employers in all states agreed to a conference with the union and the
result was an agreement which was registered as a consent award in the federal court.22

For two more years the trade limped through the depression. The cumulative effects of
years of short-time and unemployment, combined with speeding-up, began to tell on
the passivity of the workers. Approximately 1000 male workers lost their jobs altogether
during the depression years from 1928 to 1935, while those at work were lucky to aver¬
age three-quarter time.23 Those fortunate enough to find work had to contend with
employers' demands that they work faster and faster. As Frank Ponchard, a boot operat¬
ive, recalled: 'You couldn't lift your head in the Depression or you'd get the sack. Fair
dinkum. The employers really took advantage of the workers—they knew you couldn't
get a job. They worked you as hard as you could go.'24 Matters came to a head in late
1934 when the New South Wales branch of the union proposed an approach to the fed¬
eral court for some relief.

Ever since Judge J. Lukin's removal from the court in 1929, New South Wales had
favoured an appeal to what was seen as a slightly more sympathetic bench.25 The New
South Wales action posed a serious threat to the authority of the Victorian officials, par¬
ticularly Arthur Long, who was federal secretary. In the face of growing rank-and-file
dissatisfaction and jibes from the 'Reds' that he was 'a bosses' man', Long was forced to
bow before the militant mood of his members.26 The union approached the employers
with a demand for a 30-hour week, a proposal obviously intended as a pretext for filing
a case in the federal court since it was clear that the employers would reject it.
The outcome was predictably abortive and the Round Table was finally replaced by the
court bench.27

How far did the era of interstate conferences bring benefits to either employers or
employees? In its main objects, the strategy was spectacularly successful. The expense1 of
arbitration hearings was eliminated. Even allowing for the cost of the entertainment of
delegates, the savings were considerable. Secondly, the interstate agreement achieved an
unprecedented level of industrial peace. This was appreciated by both management and
workers, neither of whom relished the prospect of strikes or lockouts. Workers in


-----

particular must be seen as the major beneficiaries of the peace as in general they had
fewer reserves to fall back on in the event of disputes stopping their wages. Those who
recalled the troubled decades before 1910 were acutely aware of this fact. Arthur Long
recalled that 'after much experience in my early days of strikes year in and year out the
true trade unionist had nothing much left for his work, after paying the [strike] levies'.28

Manufacturers, of course, also benefited from uninterrupted production. This was par¬
ticularly appreciated during the boom-time war years when the commitment of the union
officials to the federal agreement was seen as largely responsible for the maintenance
of 'discipline' amongst the more volatile rank and file.29 Union records bear out this
impression, with Long working hard to prevent stoppages in the face of a certain amount
of worker discontent. In fact, few disputes occurred in regard to the terms of the agreement,
most dissatisfaction being confined to specific grievances at individual factories. The
exception to this was the threatened strike over the question of reduced hours in 1920-21.
In this case a reduction in hours under the agreement averted potential conflict.30

What other gains were to be had from this peace? The answer is by no means clear and
largely depends on one's perspective at the pay desk. It also depends on how one evalu¬
ates the alternatives: that is, what different result could have been expected under arbi¬
tration or under the combination of the Wages Board and direct action?

In order to tease out the various strands to this question it is useful to look at the points
of view of the groups on either side who most consistently advocated the peaceful policy
of the Round Table. On the workers' side, foremost advocate was Arthur Long, initially
Victorian Branch secretary and also federal secretary. Thomas Richards, who succeeded
Long as Victorian secretary, was also committed to the policy. They were supported by a
majority of the executive and a majority of the members.31 They believed that workers
could expect a fair deal from 'reasonable and reputable employers' if they were
approached in the right spirit, and that such a deal could be enforced on less reasonable
manufacturers.32 Conferences also had the advantage of being able to arrive at an agree¬
ment more to the liking of both sides. As the union's federal committee put it: 'the great
advantage of Conference is . .. being able to say no to any objectionable condition but,
when in Court, you must take what they give you or do as the Timber Workers did

[i.e. strike]'.33

On the employers' side, most of the major manufacturers supported the conference
system. Arthur Whybrow, Australia's largest boot manufacturer until the mid-1920s,
was also the most sympathetic to the needs of his workers and the most conciliatory in
his approach to the union.34 He was usually supported by other 'reputable' employers
such as Thomas Young Harkness, Daniel Hellings and the Bedggood family.35 Veterans
of the campaign to mechanise bootmaking, they had no desire for further radical change
in the work process or further acrimony in their dealings with their workers. Some also
had factories in more than one state and for them uniformity of wages and conditions
had obvious advantages.36 Even that maverick amongst manufacturers, William
Marshall, deprived of his cheap boy labour by the Higgins award, supported collective
bargaining in preference to the arbitrary arbitration of the state.

On the other hand, most of the smaller manufacturers were prepared to be led by
a few of the disaffected 'big men'. W. D. Cookes (of the giant Ezywalkin firm) and


-----

]. H. Sharwood were relative newcomers to the trade and were entranced by 'modern'
methods in industry, even if their industrial relations style lacked sophistication. Seduced
by scientific management with its logic of subdivision and payment by results, they
attempted to break down the status of male bootmakers and hive off their less skilled
tasks to cheaper female and boy labour.The smaller manufacturers, caught in the whole¬
sale cost-price war, were carried along in this quest for cheaper labour.37

At the heart of the matter was the status of the male boot worker as 'skilled', and the
flat-rate margin for skill of 12 shillings which he received under Higgins' original award.
Prior to the award in 1909, Wages Board determinations had distinguished between the
'more skilled' operations of clicking, stuff-cutting, making and finishing and the 'less
skilled' work of lining assistants, assistant stuff-cutters and men involved in treeing and
cleaning up boots. The 'skilled' category under the Wages Board accounted for about
90 per cent of the male workers.38 For Long and his colleagues, Higgins' judgement rep¬
resented a considerable victory. By providing a broad-based apprenticeship and a flat-
rate margin, his award effectively stopped the wholesale degradation of the bootmakers'
craft which had been occurring since the introduction of machinery and subdivision in
the 1890s. The benefits to the male worker went beyond monetary rewards. As one
bootmaker noted, the more varied work experience which resulted meant that 'a worker
can feel that in his particular calling he is realising his manhood rather than functioning
as a machine'.39 The rehabilitation of the bootmaker's masculinity was reinforced by
equal pay provisions under the Wages Board determination which repulsed any possi¬
bility of invasion from cheap female labour. At the same time, restrictions on the num¬
bers of apprentices and improvers employed checked this source of cheap labour and
reduced overcrowding in the adult section of the trade.40 Given the history of the pre¬
vious two decades, it is impossible to underestimate the gain which Higgins' award rep¬
resented to male workers. The interstate conferences were seen by them first and
foremost as a way to preserve these gains. Seen from this point of view, the Round Tables
cannot be seen as anything but a success. The apprenticeship system continued in its
broad form and was in fact reinforced by the Victorian Apprenticeship Commission in
1932.41 The flat-rate margin, although seriously eroded by inflation in the war years and
the 1920s, nevertheless acted as a disincentive to the employment of 'green' labour.42 In
the peak production war years some manufacturers had used men 'off the streets' on the
simpler tasks in the making and finishing rooms.43 Moves to 'classify' such tasks at
cheaper rates would have no doubt led to the widespread use of untrained men on this
work. From the union's point of view, then, the Round Table preserved bootmaking as a
skilled occupation for tradesmen, even though some of these tradesmen were not as well
rewarded for their expertise as they might have wished. As Arthur Long explained:

we fight at all costs for a flat rate minimum by which means we claim we maintain a higher basis for
the average man and a better wage for the trade all round. For many years the more skilled operative
did not approve of that policy, but to-day they recognise they are better off.44

So important was the principle of the flat-rate margin that the union was prepared to
concede the possibility of higher wages rather than agree to classification. As J. E. Ager,
president of the Manufacturers' Association, pointed out in 1938: 'I think the position


-----

Australian Leather journal, 16 March 1908, p. 743. (State Library of Victoria)

was largely that for many years we have gone on a flat rate, and as long as the Union's
demands for higher wages were kept within reason we didn't worry too much about it,
although we recognised it was not really a fair basis of payment.'45 J. J. Maloney, sec¬
retary of the New South Wales branch of the union, put the situation more forcefully
when he wrote that throughout the years up to 1935, 'the employers always held over
the head of the Union the big stick of Classification ... So, in order to save the flat rat[e]
of 12/-, the wages rates and working conditions were sacrificed.'46

The union was also successful in confining women to the upper-machining and pack¬
ing departments. It suffered an initial setback in 1911 when it had to concede some work
on the new Fortuna skiver to women. Under threat of strike action, however, the Wages
Board reversed its decision.47 From 1913 the interstate conferences endorsed the line of
demarcation between men's and women's work established by the Victorian Wages
Board.48 The subsequent history of Round Table Conferences was the history of the
extension of male labour rather than the reverse. With the growth of slipper making and
children's shoe manufacturing, for instance, any disputes about which sex should per¬
form certain new ambiguous classes of work were settled in the men's favour.49 The
increase in female workers relative to men from the early 1920s was partly due to the
increase in these latter classes of footwear which were mainly 'female' work as custom¬
arily defined.50 (See Appendix, Table A10.) It was also a reflection of the higher level of
male unemployment and the increased demand for machinists to perform the extra work
on the fashionable fancy uppers. So, despite an increase in the percentage of workers
who were female from 39.9 in 1920 to 50.4 in 1934, there was no shift in the division of
work in women's favour.


-----

As a defensive strategy, interstate agreements were thus very effective. Indeed, given
the court's record in other cases it is unlikely that the workers would have gained much
more during the 1920s and highly likely that they would have had to concede territory to
cheaper labour (both male and female) under the changed attitude of the bench in the
1930s. The 1938 award, to which we will return shortly, is indicative of what could have
been expected at any time during the 1930s. Not only did this award classify male labour
but it also extended the range of tasks which could be performed by women at 'women's
rates'. Nor does it seem likely that direct action could have offered any greater security.
Plagued by intermittent employment, the union was hardly in a position to engage in a
show of strength with manufacturers. In any event, costly strikes seemed a pointless
exercise when peaceful negotiations appeared adequate to defend the workers' position.

The continuance of conferences also helped maintain workers' earnings in the face of
emergency cuts imposed by the federal court in 1931. In the boot industry such cuts were
not imposed by conference until 1932, and even then the amount of the reduction was
only half that prescribed by the court and was imposed in two stages at six-monthly
intervals, giving the workers further reprieve.51

the union's affairs: Executive Committee, Victorian Branch of ABTEF, with union banner, 1915.

From the manufacturers' point of view, the court's reinforcement of male work as
skilled was not as disastrous for the trade as many had feared. The 12-shilling margin
was moderate compared to those paid in other skilled trades, and the broad-based
apprenticeship produced a more flexible workforce.52 Victorian boot manufacturers thus
discovered what Marx had noted in Capital: that there is an inherent contradiction
between the increasing specialisation of workers and industry's need for a versatile
workforce.53 This flexibility was of particular advantage during the years of comparative
labour shortage between 1915 and 1920. Nor did most manufacturers resent the restric¬
tions on boy labour. Before the award it was only the odd manufacturer, notably William
Marshall, who took excessive advantage of the unlimited number of apprentices allowed
under Victorian legislation between 1903 and 1911. The interstate agreement following
the award brought these manufacturers into line and removed the slur on Victoria's
employers which such practices had attracted. Indeed, in 1910 the employers' represen¬
tatives on the Victorian Wages Board petitioned the Minister for Labour to reintroduce
legislation to limit the number of apprentices.54 When Marshall again attempted to
exploit a loophole regarding boy labour in the 1930s, other manufacturers co-operated
with the union to have his practices stopped.55

Most of the major boot manufacturers, as the Leather Journal proclaimed, had no desire
to sweat their workers if it was possible not to and still remain competitive. They exerted
more influence than the 'number of employers ... who seem to have no regard for their
employees at all'.56 The journal believed that

It is safe to assert . . . that the Australian boot manufacturers as a body are possessed of an earnest
wish, a most sincere desire, for the betterment of the affairs, both hygienic and financial, of those
who are in their service . .. they have repeatedly demonstrated their consciousness of the fact that a
workman or a workwoman who is well clad, well fed, well housed and contented, is consequently
capable of rendering a much better return to those who employ him or her than can one who is ill
clad, under fed, poorly housed, and discontented.57

Interstate agreements gave the 'reputable employers' the opportunity to live at peace
with their consciences and their workers without fearing the 'sweater' in the next state.

Those manufacturers who at times wished to break away from conference saw in the
Wages Board an opportunity to gain an advantage over their interstate rivals. But even
had they succeeded, their advantage would have been short-lived. State wage-fixing tri¬
bunals were notoriously reluctant to make any award which would disadvantage local
manufacturers in interstate competition. It is therefore highly likely that any concessions
wrested from the Victorian Wages Board would have eventually been secured from other
state tribunals. The result would have been a magnification of that destructive compe¬
tition to which Higgins referred in his 1909 judgement, which in the long term was to
no-one's advantage. Conferences ensured a degree of peace in the 'fight' amongst manu¬
facturers as well as in the struggle between capitalist and worker.

Measured in terms of actual advances for workers, the record of conference agree¬
ments is less impressive. Because these agreements followed the general pattern of
precedents set in the court, the boot trade tended to lag behind other industries which
gained concessions from its awards. For instance, the clothing trade won the 44-hour


-----

week in 1919; the boot trade in 1921. Overtime payments, including meal money, were
not brought into line with the 1919 clothing trade award until 1932. There was no allow¬
ance for a higher rate for casual work in the boot trade. While workers in other industries
had secured weekly hiring in the 1920s, the boot trade had to wait until the 1938 federal
award. Until then employees were engaged by the hour and could be sacked at a
moment's notice. Rest periods, also granted to clothing workers in 1919, were not
granted at all under interstate agreements in the boot industry. On the other hand, con¬
cessions made by the union in 1916 to allow 'green' adult female workers into the trade
at lower rates of pay had serious repercussions for women during the depression.58
Union officials were prepared to make concessions on these points rather than jeopardise
what they saw as their two most important gains—the 44-hour week and the flat rate for
men.59 These agreements were likewise silent regarding factory conditions such as eating
and seating accommodation. The concern for the health and welfare of Australia's future
mothers, which was at the forefront of discussions on women's working conditions
before the court, seems not to have been an issue to the men who decided these matters
at the interstate conferences.

The fate of women workers in the boot trade is in fact the most serious blot on the his¬
tory of the Round Table agreements. As we have seen, women's working conditions were
not considered an issue. Their wages were of more importance, but only insofar as they
posed a threat to men's jobs. In the women's departments of upper-machining, beading
and packing, women were, with one exception, all accorded a minimum wage of less
than 52 per cent the male rate. The obvious question is why were all men in the trade
deemed skilled when almost all women were paid as unskilled workers?

The explanation does not lie in the different degrees of expertise required. At least two
Arbitration Court judges (Beeby and Curlewis) considered machinists' work to be skilled
and deserving at least the same remuneration as machinists in the clothing trades.60
David Johnstone, former secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Bootmakers'
Union and subsequently secretary of the Boot, Shoe and Slipper Manufacturers' Associ¬
ation, maintained that 'it is common knowledge in all industries where sewing machines
are used, that the boot machinist is ahead of many other machinists in skill and
aptitude, and eminently suitable, and much sought after for the many positions
offering'.61 Indeed, an independent commentator believed that the increasing
demand for fancy uppers in the 1930s required an even higher degree of skill on the
part of machinists.62 Certainly, their work required accuracy so as not to spoil expen¬
sive upper leather. Operatives also had to possess considerable dexterity to be able
to do this work at speed.

If we can assume that machinists did possess a degree of 'skill' and, as we have seen,
their services were sought after by manufacturers, why were they not rewarded by legal
margins in the same way that men were, or women in the clothing industry? The answer
is complex. Under the original Boot Wages Board determination, all women in the trade
were awarded a flat minimum of 20 shillings per week, regardless of their occupation.
This rate, as we saw in Chapter Five, increased by only one shilling over the course of the
first decade of the century. Thus in 1911, women received a mere 38.8 per cent of the
male rate, which had increased from 42 to 54 shillings. The first federal award did not


-----

apply to women, but it indirectly affected their wages. In the wake of considerable
dissatisfaction on the part of women workers about their wages, and anxiety by men
over female competition, the union made moves on the Wages Board to have women's
wages adjusted. The workers' delegates applied for an increase on the same principle as
that which had been granted by the federal court: a flat marginal rate set at an average
level of skill for the industry. For women, the convention calculating wages at half
those paid to men was also employed. The rate for women was thus calculated by
halving the male basic wage (42s) and adding half the male margin (12s). The amount
arrived at was therefore 27s. It seems the union asked for 27s 6d to allow a slight area
for compromise.63

The employers, however, sought a classification of rates, ranging from 22s 6d (the
existing minimum) to 24s for machinists and fitters and 26s for vampers. Under this
scheme the majority of workers would have received 24s. Wax-thread machinists were
considered by both sides to be in a completely separate category (the union claimed
32s 6d as their margin). When the matter came before the Board, the question was
decided on the casting vote of the chairman who voted for a compromise: a flat rate of
25s 6d and 32s 6d for wax-thread machinists.64 This formula effectively reduced the flat
rate to an unskilled wage, representing only 47.2 per cent of the male rate. From 1913
this proportion was incorporated into interstate agreements at the Round Table
Conferences.65

The disparity with machinists in other trades became very obvious once the clothing
trade received an award of the federal court. The formula Higgins used was to fix a
minimum of about 52 per cent the male basic rate and margins at two-thirds those
granted to men.66 This meant that, although the basic wage in the clothing trade was
slightly lower than the boot trade's flat rate, in practice most of the women workers, who
were machinists, received margins considerably above this amount. The disparity was
noted by judge Curlewis in the New South Wales Arbitration Court in 1920 who
announced his intention to give women the same proportion over the living wage as the
men were getting, 'or something of that sort'. He proclaimed that he was 'not going to
have women with four years' experience on skilled work kept on the living wage. It
is ridiculous.'67

Curlewis' intentions were, however, thwarted. The union representative explained to
him that they could not ask any more than 39 shillings because this was the amount
agreed to by the interstate conference. Although a further conference raised the amount
to 44 shillings, it was still no proportionate advance in comparison with the men.68

These rates were translated into the agreement between manufacturers and the union
at the 1921 interstate conference. Judge Curlewis' outburst on the injustice of the
amounts fixed for skilled women had no impact: the conference did not reconsider its
formula but continued to fix women's rates at less than 50 per cent those of men. The
attention devoted to the question is indicated by the following report of conference
proceedings: 'At the Friday session of the conference, the pay of females was dealt with,
and numerous minor matters, all business being disposed of in time for lunch.'69

Nor was any reassessment of women's wages attempted at any subsequent confer¬
ences. This was one instance where federal Arbitration Court precedents were not


-----

followed. Had they adhered to Higgins' formula, the flat rate would have been more in
line with that paid to the few wax-thread machinists, who received between 58 and 61
per cent of the male rate.

It seems, then, that women were awarded so little because no attempt was made by the
union delegates to have the amount increased. Given the chronic seasonal shortages of
skilled machinists and the over-award payments which were made to attract them,
manufacturers would probably have been receptive to an increase in the minimum had it
been bargained for.70 The Arbitration Court precedents would have added weight to
such a move. The fact that increases were not sought reflects the almost invisible profile
of women within the union. Women made up about one-third of the membership, but
they were forbidden under the rules from holding the position of shop president.71 This
effectively debarred them from positions of responsibility within the union structure. The
union's ordinary business was conducted by regular meetings of shop presidents—all
men. Between meetings an all-male executive attended to outstanding business. Logs of
claims for presentation to employers were drawn up by the all-male federal council with¬
out formal consultation with female members. On the rare occasions on which someone
suggested that female representation was desirable, the suggestions were virtually
ignored.72 Indeed, the only times when the union appeared to notice its female members
were on occasions where they could be used to secure some advantage for their male
workmates. For example, no attempt was made to organise women for the appeal to the
federal court in 1909 because at that time the threat was from boy labour, not females.
However, shortly after this award we find officials in both New South Wales and
Victoria anxiously organising women. Why? Because in the meantime employers had
introduced female labour to operate the new Fortuna skiving machines.73 As with
the bookbinders who were so enthusiastically helping their women's union at the same
time, the men's motives were explicit. The secretary of the New South Wales
branch explained:

To the employees, male and female, this was a serious question, for to the male it was the end of a rec¬
ognised dividing line in the trade. The female, who was unorganised at this period, could see that she
was to be used on certain minor machines because she was cheap compared to the apprentice in the
stuff-cutting department, and it did not need much argument to convince the females that they
should join the union.74

After this flurry of activity, women again slipped from view until the classification and
longer hours scare of 1922. On this occasion a new tactic emerged: the organisation of
special mass meetings of female operatives as a way of demonstrating union power. It
seems that manufacturers feared a strike of women more than one of men because of
the relative scarcity of competent female labour. The union secretary, Arthur Long,
explained to his New Zealand counterpart that 'There is no doubt the employers feared a
strike as trade was very busy and female labour in particular very scarce.'75 Ironically,
the otherwise invisible female membership proved the union's major asset in this show of
strength. Nine hundred women attended the mass meeting.76

It is not hard to explain why women played such a small role in union affairs. Quite
clearly, the men felt it was none of their business and, with the exceptions mentioned,


-----

made little attempt to encourage women to join.77 Long's energetic and sustained recruit¬
ment of men, involving visits to factories where he addressed the workmen and then set
up his folding table and chair in order to sign up members, had no equivalent where
women were concerned.78 And, while male union members refused to work alongside
male non-unionists, shop presidents often did not even bother to ask women to join.79
The rigid sexual segregation of the factory was carried over into union affairs. Women
generally met separately.80 On the rare occasions when mixed meetings were held, the
Temperance Hall was secured as the venue and the balcony set aside for 'the females'.81
From their gallery, women could watch the real deliberations being conducted below.
Where separate meetings were held, their major purpose was to endorse the action of
officials or to give them carte blanche to act on the women's behalf.82 And while other
unions with women members met from time to time to discuss matters of common inter¬
est, the Boot Trade Union was conspicuous by its absence. Requests for delegates to such
meetings were invariably ignored.83

How is the historian to interpret this situation? Are we looking at overwhelming
female apathy or insurmountable male hostility? I would suggest that although there
were undoubtedly elements of both, the more important reason lies in the relationship
between the family and the workplace in the bootmaking suburbs of Collingwood, Rich¬
mond and Clifton Hill. Bootmaking dominated these suburbs, especially Collingwood,
and as the major employer of labour often drew fathers, brothers, sisters and occasionally
mothers and wives into the same industry.84

In these circumstances, the upper-closing room served the same function as the home:
a separate sphere for women where they need not trespass on 'men's work'. And in the
same way as the ideology of separate spheres decreed a division between public and pri¬
vate, domestic and political activity, so this division was replicated in the factory and its
politics. Men carried on the important business of union decision-making on behalf of
their womenfolk, who were kept at a safe distance in the machine room or the Temper¬
ance Hall gallery. A Trades Hall circular from 1921 'requesting all Unionists [presumably
male] to see that their daughters and sisters are members of the Union covering the
Industry in which they are employed' is evidence of pervasive patriarchal attitudes in the
union movement.85 These attitudes added to the problems of organising seasonal
workers with high levels of turnover.

As within the home, women to some extent colluded in this 'protective' invisibility.
A mass meeting of women in 1922, for instance, carried a resolution which concluded
with an undertaking to 'place ourselves unreservedly in the hands of the Boot Trade
Federation'.86

One could also speculate that the prevalence of short-time amongst male workers,
which posed a threat to their position as the breadwinner within the home, made it even
more imperative that women should be kept in their place at work. Indeed, some .men
may have even considered it in their interests to keep women's wages low as a way of
enhancing the value of their own contribution to the family economy.

The women members who put their faith in the male unionists to look after their
interests were in retrospect misguided. That women's and men's interests were not ident¬
ical is most starkly indicated by the plight of women such as Mrs Ellen Don, left a widow


-----

with two children to support. Managing on a machinists' wage of £2 9s proved imposs¬
ible and she was forced to board out her daughter, seeing her only once a month.87 Other
women were also the main supports of families, whether of their own children or of
invalid or unemployed parents.88 For them it must have been little consolation to know
that their situation was not typical of female workers, and that in setting the wages for
women, men had in mind their sisters and daughters whose livelihood was partially sub¬
sidised by male earnings.

Nor were attempts to exclude women from certain occupations always seen by the
women as in their interests. In the lean days of winter 1931 a deputation of 'girls', dis¬
missed because of a shift in the line of demarcation on slipper making, certainly per¬
ceived their interests as separate to those of the men who replaced them.89

It would also be misleading to suggest that women had no separate appreciation of
their rights or, indeed, of the benefits of collective action. Throughout this period there
are instances of effective strikes by women against specific attacks on their working con¬
ditions. Such strikes were supported by unionist and non-unionist alike.90 The response
of women to calls by the union to resist collective attacks by employers on workers' con¬
ditions also indicates a sensitivity to class issues as well as a willingness to trust male
unionists.91 And even this expressed willingness to be guided by men had its limitations
in practice, as there are several cases of female strikers refusing to accept the advice of the
union secretary on the dispute.92 Women thus tried to negotiate some control in an
industrial relations structure which otherwise neglected them.

'Speeding-up' was a problem which proved beyond the conciliatory powers of the
Round Table Conference. As we saw in the first part of this chapter, workers worked at
full speed in order to retain their jobs. This was especially true of the depression years.
The union seemed powerless to intervene. Its officials complained to the manufacturers'
representatives about this 'driving system', only to be told that it was the workers' own
fault: they should not work so 'terrifically hard'.93 This response, denying the limits to
individual 'choice' in the matter, was unhelpful. Manufacturers were similarly con¬
strained. Individual employers were clearly unwilling to reduce workloads when their
competitors might continue to drive their workers. The real problem was structural as
well as personal. The boot industry as a whole was over-capitalised. Too many firms
competed for too few orders, allowing retailers to play one manufacturer off against
another in order to get lower wholesale prices.94

There were a limited number of solutions to the situation, individual resistance not
being one of them. Firstly, manufacturers could have combined to resist price-cutting by
retailers and rationalise production. Attempts at price regulation were not attempted.
The Manufacturers' Association, as one commentator put it, could not regulate any¬
thing.95 Or, as the Victorian union secretary quipped, the manufacturers 'have an
Association which exists to cut one another's throats'.96 Similarly, there was no attempt
to limit competition and production costs by reducing the range of styles produced by
each firm. It is unlikely that such an attempt would have succeeded, given the previous
history of divisions within the manufacturers' camp.

Secondly, the workers could have combined to limit their output. This, too, was not
attempted during the worst years of the depression. With so many 'walking about', those


-----

with jobs were not inclined to complain about having too much work. More importantly,
there was no structure to accommodate the kind of factory-specific action required. The
union's emphasis on monthly meetings of shop presidents was hardly designed to foster
rank-and-file militancy.

The third possible solution was the slowest, the most painful, and the one which pre¬
vailed. A process of economic attrition occurred during which a number of manufac¬
turers 'went to the wall'. Although they were replaced by new hopefuls, the overall
number of manufacturing firms declined.97 At the same time as this process of rationalis¬
ation was occurring, the economy as a whole was making a slow recovery, thus increas¬
ing demand for boots and shoes. With this increased demand, retailers were less able to
name their price and manufacturers were under less pressure to cheapen production.
Similarly, increased employment opportunities made workers less vulnerable to the driv¬
ing tactics of manufacturers. For their part, bosses and workers waited more or less
passively for the return of prosperity.

A further problem with which the Round Table Conference proved unable to deal was
the sweating of workers in the basket shoe industry. (Basket shoes were sandal-style
shoes made from strips of woven or plaited leather.) Manufacturers in this section were
not members of the Boot Manufacturers' Association and were immune to pressure from
fellow employers regarding their methods. The union for its part used the state Factories
and Shops Act to prosecute breaches of the Wages Board determination, but the more
persistent offenders managed to evade the law. By placing workers on contract, or
making them shareholders in the company, the principal employer could not be convic¬
ted. Some even went to the extent of erecting partitions around each small group of
workers for which they charged rent as 'factories'.98

The other strategy open to the union was not pursued partly because of intolerance
and racism on the part of the Boot Trade Union officials.99 When basket shoe workers
formed themselves into a union in 1935 and went on strike, they received only limited
support from the union which would not permit these workers to become members of its
organisation.100

Apart from the basket shoe industry, the second half of the 1930s saw a radical change
to the industrial climate in the boot trade. Militant left-wing pressure forced the more
'moderate' federal union leadership to reassess it tactics. Conferences were abandoned in
favour of an appeal to the Commonwealth court. In their quest for better wages and con¬
ditions, the militants were prepared to fight the employers on the issue of classification if
necessary.101 At the same time, shop committees were formed in a number of factories
with the express purpose of combating speed-ups. These met with moderate success.102

The new mood in the union, fuelled by the activities of the Militant Minority of the
Communist Party, also encouraged more active female involvement in union affairs.103
There was now a larger number of married women and older single women in factories,
and they tended to be more confident and more aware of the realities of women's econ¬
omic position. Such women, drawn into factories in the changed economic conditions of
the 1930s, also contributed to a slightly higher profile for women in the industry. For the
first time the union responded to requests for women delegates to general conferences by
issuing shop notices and calling for nominations.104 Meetings of women, which secured


-----

'good representation', were also held to discuss the new log of wages and conditions.105
At the same time, however, a circular from Muriel Heagney requesting co-operation on
the Equal Status Committee was ignored, and a proposal to appoint a woman organiser
rejected by 38 to 24, with the secretary opposing the appointment.106

Meanwhile, the union served its new log of claims on employers. These included a
30-hour week and a minimum male wage of £7 10s.107 In retaliation, the employers sub¬
mitted a claim for reclassification, arguing that the industry could no longer afford to pay
men wheeling raw material on trolleys a skilled wage.108 It seems that most employers did
not want reclassification, because it would only complicate accounting, but having held it
up as a threat to the union for so long they were obliged to go through with the claim.109

Because of a backlog of cases in the court, however, the bootmakers' claim was not
heard until 1937. The sitting of the court was brief and dealt mainly with the more
urgent matter of adjusting wages and the question of trainee apprenticeships in New
South Wales. The 1937 award was clearly given to keep the peace until a more full inves¬
tigation of the trade could be made, as parties were given leave to apply for a variation
after six months.110 The workers in particular were dissatisfied with the small increases
in wages. Had it not been for the possibility of a rehearing in the near future, strikes
would probably have been resorted to. As it happened, the officials persuaded the more
militant members to bide their time and application was duly made to the court.111

The hearing occurred in May 1938 and involved a thorough reconsideration of the
whole trade. The union had modified its claims since 1935, this time asking for a
40-hour week and a male rate of £5 5s. It also sought an increase in the base rate for
women to 60 per cent of the male rate. The employers, however, pursued their counter¬
claim for reclassification.112

In arriving at his decision, Beeby was concerned to rescue bootmaking from the 'back¬
wash' into which it had been forced under the original award.113 As he pointed out,
Higgins had not set men's wages in line with those in other skilled trades because of fear
that increased wage costs would lead directly to increased importations.114 The situation
had changed since 1910. Although imports were recovering slightly from their almost
negligible contribution in 1930-31, they posed no serious threat. As Beeby saw it:

I do not think that the danger of influx of foreign products is sufficient to deter the Court from pre¬
scribing what it deems to be proper wage rates and conditions of employment for the industry, and
feel confident that the Tariff Board will recommend such tariff readjustments as may be necessary.115

Having decided not to take into account the question of imports, Beeby was confronted
with the task of setting a rate which would more fairly reflect the skill of the trade than
the existing 12 shillings. He maintained that it was not disputed that bootmaking was a
skilled trade—'skilled in the sense that [it requires] knowledge of the qualities of
materials used and high manipulative ability acquired by years of experience in most of
the processes'.116 Like Higgins, he recognised that bootmaking had become a machine
industry with a high degree of specialisation, but he too saw an important distinc¬
tion between the operation of these machines and the work of mere machine-feeders
in other industries. Few bootmaking machines were automatic; they were, rather,
'tools of the trade' requiring dexterity and concentration in order to produce satisfactory


-----

results. And although the work was subdivided, evenness of manipulative ability was
crucial to the job:

Operatives work in teams at great speed. Each on completing his process passes the work on to the
next in the team. Before a boot is completed it passes through the hands of from 30 to 40 employees.
Some of the processes appear simple, but, on inspection, employers admitted that with odd
exceptions one was as important as the other. Defective workmanship in any might spoil the ultimate
result.117

Beeby also pointed out that although a 'workman may use only one machine or power-
driven tool year in and year out', he required years of training on a range of tasks before
being put in charge of that machine. Furthermore, interchangeability of labour was
essential to keep the team system operating smoothly. For these reasons, he maintained
that boot operatives could justifiably claim to be on 'a higher level than the ordinary run
of semi-skilled workers'. They could not, however, expect to be placed on the same
footing as those trades calling for 'mental effort', such as engineering, electrical trades
and carpentry.118

Nor was he prepared to give increased margins on processes 'which are admittedly of
a simple nature', requiring 'no skill and limited experience'. The problem which con¬
fronted him was the 'impossible task of assessing the comparative value of almost every
process'. He rejected from the outset any attempt to fix rates for the multitude of classifi¬
cations proposed by the employers. Such a scheme, he believed, would be 'both unjust
and impracticable' because of the interdependent nature of the various separate tasks.
The solution he arrived at was to 'narrow the gaps' between the various classifications in
order to provide average justice. He thus provided for overall increases in margins for
men. At the same time, he marked out a number of 'simpler' tasks for a reduced margin
(9s) with the explicit intention that such work would be assigned to unapprenticed male
labour or females.119

The union was by no means pleased with the award, particularly with the additional
boy labour permitted. Nor were the men happy about the clauses which extended the
use of female labour at female rates to a range of 'men's work' such as inking edges and
preparing shanks.120 In extending women's work, Beeby hoped to compensate employers
for wage increases and also to make the line of demarcation between the sexes consistent
with that prevailing in accessory factories.121

Beeby's award was of more obvious advantage to women. Inspecting operations at
boot factories to assist him in assigning skill margins, both the judge and 'his assistant',
a Miss Beeby, visited the women's departments. Miss Beeby in particular was reportedly
very impressed with the skill and speed the women displayed in machining uppers.122
Beeby considered the sewing of uppers was 'harder and more exacting than ordinary
machine sewing . .. The craze for fancy uppers involves a great increase in the skiving
and machining and decoration of small parts before their final assembling into complete
uppers.'123 He added that: 'On inspection I was impressed with the speed at which the
women work, and the intense application to their tasks which is necessary.'

The subsequent award broke new ground in acknowledging a degree of skill on this
work and all sewing machinists were awarded a margin of three shillings per week.


-----

As Beeby commented, this amount at least brought them more in line with women doing
comparable work in the clothing trades. Other machinists received a margin of half that
amount. Had Beeby applied the same principle to the assessment of women's skill as he
did to that of men, however, these amounts would have been much greater. Sewing
machines were as much 'tools of the trade' as were making and finishing machines, and
the dexterity, knowledge of materials and responsibility for evenness of quality were
every bit as great as in the men's departments. That he did not grant them more
was clearly because of the traditional practice of fixing women's rates in general below
those of men. He was also concerned to achieve parity with rates awarded in the
clothing trade.

Women also gained from provision in the award for a rest period each morning 'on
account of the high speed at which they worked'. What had previously been a privilege
granted in a few factories thus became a general condition of the trade. Female boot
operatives were at last approaching minimum legal standards in the clothing trade.124

In addition to the changes it brought to women, Beeby's award had revolutionary
implications for men. Although bootmakers had lost their cherished flat rate, they had on
balance gained in status and payment. On the other hand, they faced the prospect of
more female and boy labour in their midst. It remained to be seen whether this combi¬
nation would indeed rescue the trade from its longstanding 'backwash'.125

The federal Arbitration Court thus played a decisive role in determining the nature of
work in the boot and shoe industry in the period from 1911 to World War II. Even when
wages and conditions were negotiated in conference rather than in court, these nego¬
tiations were conducted within the framework set by the 1910 award and with reference
to prevailing trends in other court awards.

The restrictions which awards and agreements placed on the employment of boys and
females meant that manufacturers had little opportunity to experiment with new forms
of production based on cheap, quickly trained labour. At the same time, the broad-based
apprenticeship and flat rate for men's work encouraged employers to adopt methods
which made most effective use of a flexible workforce. In practice, this meant preserving
the existing team system, whereby an interchangeable group of men performed moder¬
ately subdivided work. Greater subdivision would have complicated apprenticeship
training and reduced the flexibility of the team.

The size of the Australian market for boots and shoes continued to have a major influ¬
ence on the work process in this period. Although heavy tariffs effectively protected local
producers from import competition, the market could still not sustain mass-production
techniques to any great extent. The great variety in styles and sizes demanded by retailers
meant that specialisation by producers was rare. Only those manufacturers who con¬
trolled retail outlets were able to rationalise their output in this way. For most factories,
product variety precluded systematic use of scientific management techniques which
relied on minute subdivision and forward planning. It also made piecework impractical.

The labour market added to the effect of product markets to discourage innovation in
the direction of Taylorism. The chronic oversupply of male labour, in particular, solved
the fundamental problem which Taylorism would have addressed: how to make sure that


-----

workers worked hard for their money. The discipline of the market ensured that individ¬
uals performed at maximum speeds; it also discouraged collective resistance by offering
a pool of unemployed labour to break strikes.

Finally, the Anglo-Australian gender order continued to exercise an important indirect
influence on the nature of work. It ensured that men's and women's work remained
rigidly demarcated and that women's work was undervalued. Not only did this affect the
women and girls who worked in the women's sections, but it also meant that men were
excluded from two of the main areas of expansion in this industry between the wars:
slipper production and the preparation and machining of fancy uppers. Thus, in the late
1930s, while employers enticed married women back to the factories, men could not find
work and manufacturers could not meet their orders because of a shortage of machinists.
The preservation of existing gender arrangements in the factory was achieved at some
cost to all concerned.

 Marginal Matters: The Printing Industries, 1925-1937

Peter Cochrane, in his overview of the history of work in Australia, has argued that the
state played an important part in 'getting the idea [of Taylorism] off the ground'. In the
years between the wars, he writes, ' "progressive" arbitrators pressed it upon sluggish
manufacturers'.1 While this assessment is probably true in general terms, the history of
the printing industry during this period reveals a rather different record. The state, in its
role as federal arbitrator, acted primarily as a conservative force: it retarded any impulses
towards the subdivision of labour by generally refusing to award different rates for dif¬
ferent aspects of 'craft' work. Nor did its conservative role stop with the work process.
Arbitration awards reinforced the existing sexual division of labour in the workplace and
differential rates of pay for the sexes and in so doing reinforced the prevailing gender
orders in the wider community.

The years from 1925 to 1939 were thus ones of consolidation rather than change in the
printing industry. There were few technological innovations, so that any changes which did
occur were continuations of existing trends rather than departures. Machines became
faster and there were more of them, but they were basically the same as those in operation
before 1925. The exception to this was the bookbinding department, where changing
fashions in office stationery had important implications for workers in this section. Loose-
leaf systems were gaining in popularity in this period in preference to bound account
books, while card systems replaced several other classes of bound work. Much of the
material used in loose-leaf and card systems was traditionally 'women's work', as defined
by the arbitration award in 1925. Women consequently found their services in greater
demand. Conversely, male bookbinders experienced a decline in the volume of their work.2

The cardboard-box and carton department was also disrupted by changing tastes.
From the late 1920s cartons increasingly replaced boxes, leading to the temporary


-----

displacement of workers from the box section. Boxmakers were also displaced by auto¬
matic machines introduced to make boot boxes in 1928. These machines made the entire
box, including cutting, gluing and pressing, the only hand operation being the stacking
of the finished boxes. In this case, however, it was women who were more adversely
affected.3

However, while the court's role was generally a conservative one in this industry, there
was one major exception. In 1925 it granted the entire industry a reduction in the work¬
ing week from 48 to 44 hours. The court's decision on this matter, and its verdicts on
issues concerned with definitions of skill, provide revealing insights into the role of the
state in shaping work.

In 1923, the newly amalgamated Printing Industries Employees Union of Australia was
busy preparing its first case for submission to the federal court.4 Amongst the claims put
forward was that from the Victorian Women and Girls Advisory Committee for a flat
rate for all women employed in the industry and the abolition of piecework. The rate
they proposed was near the existing 'skilled' rate paid under the Wages Board schedule,
which differentiated between the wages of workers according to supposed levels
of skill.5

Their rejection of 'classification' (or a scale of rates) was a strategic decision aimed
at raising the general level of female wages. Under the existing schedule, only a few
workers were entitled to the top rate. Most were awarded either the basic wage or one or
two shillings above it. The women unionists as a group were therefore prepared to forgo
an increase in the top rate in the hope of securing significant increases for the majority.
This strategy was in fact similar to the one employed by male bootmakers in 1910 and
endorsed by Higgins in his award. The women's attitude to classification, as does that of
the bootmakers, illustrates the dangers of generalising about the effects of arbitration
awards without paying due attention to specific cases. Bennett, and others, have
assumed that there was an intrinsic advantage in workers as a group having detailed job
descriptions or classifications rather than a flat rate.6 As this case shows, whether or not
classification was an advantage depended on whether such schedules included different
rates for different jobs and if so, what percentage of workers fell into each category.

The women's suggestions were rejected by the federal council of the union. Instead,
the official claim sought a classification of wages which differentiated between various
levels of 'skill'. Most importantly, it provided for the basic wage to cover a large section of
the female workforce. And in the absence of a comprehensive piecework schedule,
employers were to have virtually a free hand in fixing piece rates, which were the domi¬
nant form of payment in the boxmaking section.7

Why did this happen? Why was it that female workers, who comprised between 35
and 55 per cent of union membership, were given such low priority in the quest for
improved wages and conditions? Clearly, their low priority reflected the powerlessness of
women within the union. As we have already seen, the terms on which the women's
unions amalgamated with the PIEUA structured this powerlessness. Women were denied
special representation on the federal council, while their smaller numbers made their
election by general ballot extremely unlikely. Indeed, it was not until 1939 that any


-----

woman succeeded in a ballot for the position of councillor. The constitution of the union
did provide for a woman's delegate in a purely advisory capacity at the invitation of the
other councillors. After 1931 the councillors consistently voted against issuing such invi¬
tations, despite concerted lobbying by the women and E. C. Magrath of New South
Wales. Women therefore had no voice at all on the union's most important policy-making
body in the crucial years between 1931 and 1939.8

Nor were they better placed in the Victorian branch. It is significant that the Victorian
delegates led the opposition to a woman sitting on federal council.9 Their stance was
symptomatic of a generally unsympathetic attitude to the female membership. Louisa
Cross irritated her male colleagues by showing no signs of retiring from her position as
organiser. (She did not retire until 1951.) Cross carried out her duties in an atmosphere
of more or less mutual suspicion and antagonism. On one occasion Frank Burke, former
secretary of the Bookbinders' Union, accused her of stacking the board of management
in order to prevent his election as temporary organiser.10

Apart from Cross and the clerical staff, no women held paid positions within the
union. We saw in Chapter Six how the executive committee was structured to give pre¬
dominance to the men. The board of management, although structurally more open to
female representation, in practice had less than 20 per cent female membership. This was
partly the result of apathy on the part of female members but also reflected the unwill¬
ingness of men to have their shops represented by women. In theory, each shop was sup¬
posed to elect its own delegates to the board. In practice, it was often difficult to persuade
anyone to accept the position. An investigation by the executive committee (into alle¬
gations of stacking the Board levelled at Cross) in 1931 revealed that what usually hap¬
pened was that someone was persuaded to take on the job of delegate and they might or
might not ask for their shopmates' approval. Enthusiastic women could probably there¬
fore have secured a place on the board without much difficulty. On the other hand, they
may have found their male colleagues less apathetic if the practice became widespread.
As one male unionist (a compositor at the Modern Printing Company) commented when
asked how he and his male workmates felt about the appointment of Miss Hyndman to
the board without their knowledge: 'he thought that possibly they would have tried to
get a man to represent them'.11 In any case, the women who had kept the earlier
women's unions alive were by the late 1920s and 1930s approaching middle age and
retirement and there were few young women with similar commitment available to
replace them.

A change in the union's structure in 1929 provided for an elected annual conference to
replace the half-yearly meetings as the major legislative body of the branch. Delegates
were chosen on a sectional basis, a system which automatically excluded the possibility
of a female majority because of the sex-segregation in the different sections. At the first
conference, for example, only nine of the twenty-eight delegates were women, although
at that time women comprised approximately half the branch's membership.12

At a less quantifiable level, it appears that male printing unionists continued to think
of the union as a male affair. In his New Year greeting to members in 1936, the federal
president, Gordon Fry, announced that: 'In striving for those things [worthwhile in life]
we are not fighting for ourselves only; we are fighting for our wives, our mothers, young


-----

brothers and sisters, and our children.'13 And although there were notable exceptions,
hostility and indifference dominated the union's attitudes to the women members. The
councillors gave no reason for rejection of women's proposals for a flat rate and the abol¬
ition of piecework, but it seems that they recognised that such claims would meet with
strong opposition from employers and they felt they had more important battles to fight
on their own behalf.

Whatever the men's reasons, the fact remains that the union rejected the women's
claims. The union's first claim in effect sought the court's endorsement of the status quo,
and the court obliged. The result was a little tinkering here and there with margins, but
overall the women workers received no real advance on the old rates. As Deputy Presi¬
dent Webb observed: 'The margins for skill [for females] are not nearly as great as the
margins for skill granted to male workers and the employees complain bitterly about
that.'14 Not until 1936 was a more comprehensive review of their margins attempted,
although this too had disappointing results. Both cases, however, are extremely illumi¬
nating as regards the court's approach to the whole issue of defining skill, especially as it
affected women's work.

It is clear from the various Arbitration hearings that the judges were guided in their
decisions by a set of ad hoc principles as to what constituted 'skill'. But, as the sub¬
sequent discussion will show, these principles were often mutually contradictory or not
amenable to 'objective' assessment.

One of the most fundamental considerations affecting the Arbitration Court judges in
regard to wage fixation was the principle of setting different rates according to different
qualities of work performed. The secondary wage, or margin above the basic wage, as it
applied to 'skill', was awarded for 'exceptional gifts or qualification' necessary to a particu¬
lar occupation. Such a margin was intended primarily to encourage workers to acquire the
extra 'skill of an artisan'.15 It was not, however, intended to allow for the range of individ¬
ual abilities workers brought to the job. Rather, it represented a minimum level of com¬
petence, with higher rates for extra ability being accounted for by market forces.16

The task of setting this minimum margin was not an easy one. As a starting point in
assessing the appropriate rate, the court examined the nature of the work entailed in any
particular occupation. This usually involved hearing evidence from witnesses as well as
observation on the shop floor.17 However, as analysis of the history of the court's judge¬
ments in general has shown, judges have not adopted any consistent, detailed criteria for
assessing the value of work.18 Bennett has argued that the only consistency has occurred
in relation to the insistence that skilled trades embrace a wide range of tasks.19 In the
printing cases examined here, judges were influenced by the discriminatory content and
difficulty of the work performed as well as the task range of a particular occupation. To
attract a designation as 'skilled', workers had to show that their normal occupation
required considerable training and knowledge, as well as some degree of calculation or
judgement.20 Other factors which might influence the level of the margin were responsi¬
bility and artistic judgement.21 Hazardous work could also be considered skilled, but
only insofar as it required skill to avoid accident.22

In practice, objective assessment on these issues was extremely unlikely. Witnesses dis¬
agreed about the difficulty of performing particular tasks and the amount of training


-----

required to become proficient. Workers without formal apprenticeships for their occu¬
pation were the worst affected in this respect: estimates of training time in some cases
varied from a few days to four years.23'Even where formal apprenticeships did exist, as
with compositors, allowance had to be made for the mutual advantage to employer and
employee of artificially extending the apprenticeship period. That is, a lengthy appren¬
ticeship bolstered the worker's claim to a skilled margin while at the same time provid¬
ing the employer with six years' cheap labour.

The question of artistic judgement was also problematic. For instance, everyone agreed
that setting type attractively required some sense of proportion and balance, but that this
amounted to 'art' was open to dispute. As the employers' advocate pointed out, milliners
and dressmakers also needed to show a sense of proportion and balance in their work,
the implication being that one would not therefore consider them to be skilled.24
The final picture which formed in the judge's mind about the skill of any particu¬
lar occupation was thus the product of a series of judgements about these im¬
precise issues, more or less influenced by the persuasiveness of the witnesses and
advocates for either side.

Having formed some idea of the nature of the work, the judge still faced the task of
assigning it a monetary value. His most important guide in this respect, following the
precedents set by Higgins, was usually the existing rate.25 Problems arose, however,
where rates varied significantly, a not infrequent occurrence since awards covered many
different states. When such a situation arose, the court's response seems to have been
aimed at compromise. In the first compositors' case, for instance, Victorian compositors
had their margin reduced by two shillings while those in Sydney, Hobart and Adelaide
had theirs increased under the terms of the award.

A further major consideration was what might be called the principle of relativity. This
operated in two ways. In the first instance, it meant that judges tried to set the margin for
any given occupation so as to maintain the existing hierarchy of margins within the
industry. Indeed, in the first printing case before the court, Deputy President Webb
hoped that after fixing the rates for compositors the parties would easily agree to the rates
for other occupations by adopting the same proportionate increase.26

In the second instance, some judges were concerned to fix rates so that they corre¬
sponded roughly with comparable occupations in other industries. The extent to which
these comparisons influenced the court varied from judge to judge. Webb, for example,
declared that he could not 'properly and fairly compare one trade with another, although
it is very natural that one should try to do so'.27 Nevertheless, he did mention opinions
which considered the skill of compositors to be equal to that of tradesmen in the metal
industries, and such comparisons were also made by the union.28 The attainment of
parity with engineers seems to have carried more weight with Dethridge, influencing
him to increase the hand compositor's margin to the same level as that awarded by Beeby
in the metalworkers' case.29

Both these applications of the principle acted against any fundamental reassessment of
the value of certain jobs, particularly those performed by women. For example, Webb
admitted in his 1925 judgement that female workers had done relatively badly out of his
award. He thought their work deserved a higher rate, but he refused to increase his


-----

award because it would put printing industry workers on a higher scale than other
female workers within the court's jurisdiction.30 As he explained, 'Under the award as I
drew it I prescribed a base wage for female workers which I had prescribed in several
other awards, and I also prescribed margins for skill which have relation to margins for
skill prescribed for female workers in other awards of the Court.'31 This meant that even
when women's work was recognised as requiring considerable skill, as was the case with
embossers, the margins awarded were only one-third those awarded to men in compar¬
able occupations.32 This is the most glaring example of the guiding principles being in
conflict. In order to maintain parity with women working in other industries, relativities
within the industry had to be sacrificed. And in maintaining parity of the full wage (basic
wage plus margins) between industries, the equality in relative proportions had to be
sacrificed. Thus, women in the clothing trade generally received margins two-thirds of
those paid to males in that industry, while women in printing received only one-third the
margins paid to their male co-workers.

It is important to consider why Webb (and his successors) decided to resolve the con¬
flict of principles in this way. Why did they decide it was more important to maintain
comparability with female occupations in other trades than with male occupations in the
same industry? Although neither judge felt it necessary to give a detailed explanation, we
can nevertheless make a few inferences. In their role as Arbitration Court judges, neither
Dethridge nor Webb saw wage justice for women as a very high priority. More important
were other economic, social and political considerations. For instance, if women's wages
in the printing industry were significantly increased, it would have been extremely likely
that women in other industries would have pressed for comparable increases. Refusal of
these claims, which presumably could not be justified by reference to 'objective' criteria
of work value, would have exposed the court to accusations of injustice. Conceding the
demands would have resulted in widespread wage increases for women. According to
the logic of the day, apparently shared by judges, such wage increases would inevitably
lead to price increases, the cost of which would be borne by consumers.33 More import¬
antly, according to this logic, the price of female wage increases would be borne by men
on fixed incomes. As Dethridge and others pointed out, judges were also men on fixed
incomes.34 Greater economic equality for women would also have upset the prevailing
gender order whereby men gained power from women's economic dependence. The sex
of the judges was therefore of double significance. As well, they often employed female
domestic labour. For all these reasons, judges had a vested interest in keeping the general
level of female wages down.

Endorsing wide differences between male and female rates in the same industry, on
the other hand, had the virtue of not upsetting the status quo. The political consequences
would be slight. As Judge Webb commented in a related case, 'it is not a matter of great
importance, except to the girls'.35 Given the powerlessness of women within the printing
union, there was hardly likely to be any concerted move by the union as a whole to
redress the injustice.

The age of workers also determined whether or not they were awarded skilled rates.
Judges assumed that workers under twenty-one years required less to live on than adults,
so they refused to award them the full margin even though it might be conceded by both


-----

sides that the worker was as efficient as an adult. This further discriminated against
women, a large proportion of whom were juniors.36

Theoretically, at least, the 'needs doctrine' dominated court assessments of base rates
throughout this period, with an increasing influence of the capacity of industry to pay
towards the end of the 1930s. However, the capacity of industry to pay margins for skill
always influenced judges in defining work as skilled. As was the case with the Common¬
wealth Arbitration Court in general, the weight of this consideration varied with time.
Webb declared in 1925 that it carried little weight with him, that it would not justify him
'in depriving employees of the margin to which they are justly entitled'.37 Ten years and
a depression later, attitudes had changed. The union felt it necessary to demonstrate the
prosperity of the industry in order to justify its claim for higher margins, while the
employers argued against increased margins because of the 'convalescent' state of the
industry after the depression.38 Dethridge clearly took such market considerations into
account. In the bookbinders' case, for example, he reluctantly reclassified a section of the
bookbinders' traditional work as unskilled in order to cheapen labour costs. By allowing
females at female rates to do work such as making blotting pads and files, he bowed to
employer pressure to try to make Australia's stationers more competitive in relation to
imported products, especially from Japan.39 In this case, the desire to facilitate 'the
proper expansion of work in the industry' led the judge to depart from Higgins' formula
in the fruitpickers' case (1912) whereby 'men's work' was awarded a man's rate, even
when performed by women.40

Dethridge's reluctance to move the traditional line of demarcation in bookbinding
points to another major influence on the definition of work as skilled or unskilled: the
desire of the court to protect the livelihood and status of male craft workers. As Webb
pointed out in his 1925 judgement, the issue was not simply a matter of whether the
work was skilled or not. As he explained: 'The matter cannot be decided on the mere fact
that women can do this work. What I have to decide is the amount of work in this indus¬
try which should be fairly reserved for men who devote their lives to become expert in
this work and for the apprentices whom they undertake to teach.'41

The changes in the 1937 award provide a striking instance of the operation of this
principle. Like most 'skilled' crafts, some aspects of the work were simpler than others
and could be performed by relatively untrained workers. By dividing these tasks from
the core of 'craft' work and prescribing for them a lower rate of pay, the court was invit¬
ing the subdivision of craftwork and the use of cheaper labour. Under the 1925 award,
for example, the making of blotting pads with paper bound edges was classed as skilled
male work and attracted a margin of twenty-four shillings. Under the 1937 award, this
same work was demoted to the status of semi-skilled female work and given an eight¬
shilling margin.42

In general, however, the court's judgements in the printing cases reflect its reluctance to
break down the craftsman's traditional skills by endorsing increased 'classification', and
hence further subdivision of labour. The case of letterpress machinists is one example. Let¬
terpress machining traditionally attracted a skilled margin comparable to bookbinding and
hand composition. In the case of letterpress machining, semi-skilled workers being paid
lower rates had, under the New South Wales state award, been doing the more routine


-----

work on small platen machines. The employers sought a reclassification under the federal
award to separate out this work and provide it with a lower margin. This Webb refused to
do, explaining that he did not wish to encourage the use of unskilled labour.43

A further factor which Dethridge claimed influenced his assessment of the level of
skill was the pace of work. In justifying an increase of three shillings per week in the
compositor's margin in 1937, he explained that he did not believe there had been any
appreciable change in the amount of skill required in hand composition since 1925, but
that the compositor 'has to use those qualifications under rather greater stress and with
quicker decision than formerly'.44 This is a rather surprising verdict, given that in no
other case was the speed of work taken into consideration. Nor was there any particular
stress placed on speeding-up in the union's case.45 It seems probable that Dethridge used
this as an excuse to bring the compositor's margin into line with the twenty-seven shil¬
lings awarded to tradesmen in the metal industry by judge Beeby.46

Finally, decisions of the Arbitration Court in respect to skill margins were always
influenced by the outcome of collective bargaining between employers and the union.
This was a formal part of court procedure: conferences between the two parties, pre¬
sided over by a judge, attempted to reach agreement on as many rates as possible. Only
when such conciliation failed to produce consensus was the matter put to the court for
arbitration. We have already seen how women's lack of power within the union disad¬
vantaged them from the outset in this process: their claims were not even endorsed
by the union, let alone the employers or the court. However, their cause was not
entirely without champions. The union's industrial advocate throughout the period was

E. C. Magrath, a man who advocated the cause of the less powerful with almost as much
enthusiasm as he did that of the craftsmen. A less determined advocate might have been
prepared to compromise more readily so as to avoid the expense and labour of a hearing.
The temptation to sacrifice some rates, particularly those of the less powerful members
(females and unskilled) must have been very strong. That Magrath did not do so is clear:
female as well as male margins were brought before the court both in 1925 and 1936.
Magrath's influence was such that he was able to secure more favourable awards for
women than had a less able or committed person presented their case. The employers'
advocate, George Anderson, on the other hand, was competent enough but was no
match for his New South Wales adversary.

The printing cases of the 1920s and 1930s suggest, however, a limitation to the useful¬
ness of using the formal record of court proceedings as a guide to the real power
dynamics of an industry. They conceal as much as they reveal about the collusion and
compromises which must have been arrived at between the two parties to any case.

There was also a less obvious way in which the collective power of workers and
employers affected awards. The PIEUA was a very strong union, with its funds and
membership relatively unscathed by the depression. There was always the possibility that
should the court disappoint the members they might choose to do without it altogether.
The Victorian branch threatened as much at the time of its application to the court in
1934.47 Indeed, the PIEUA as a whole launched a campaign against arbitration in the
wake of the 1937 award. That the union did not choose to flex its industrial muscles on
behalf of its female members is significant.


-----

Laura Bennett has argued that skilled male workers perform work that is characteristi¬
cally different to unskilled women's work. Indeed, it is the characteristic of this work (in
particular encompassing a broad range of tasks) which gave workers the strategic base
for their industrial muscle. These characteristics of male skilled work came to be adopted
by the Arbitration Court as its indicia of skilled work. The court adopted the ideology of
skill which prevailed in the Australian marketplace at the time of its inception. The con¬
verse of this argument is that women were typically unskilled workers because the tech¬
nological and market structure of their work was not conducive to craft organisation.
That is, their work was typically fragmented and repetitive. In awarding low skill mar¬
gins for women, she argues, the court was simply reflecting the different nature of
women's work which lacked the features of craft organisation and therefore gave them
little power in the labour market.48

The printers' case is of particular interest in relation to this argument because it was
not typical of the industries in which women were employed—those characterised as
labour-intensive, technologically stagnant, poorly unionised and subject to high levels of
seasonal unemployment and outwork. The printing industries in general had more in
common with 'men's' industries such as engineering than with other industries employ¬
ing women. However, as we have seen, women in printing occupations fared little better
in the industrial arena than their contemporaries doing more typically female work in
more typically female industries. The majority of women print workers, who performed
monotonous, repetitive tasks, received rates comparable to similar female workers in
other industries, despite the fact that the printing industry in general did not conform to
the usual model of a woman's industry and despite the fact that the union that rep¬
resented them was one of the country's strongest. The minority of women who per¬
formed work which on the court's own criteria conformed to the craft or semi-craft
model were unsuccessful in having their margins reflect these skills. That women's work
was not better paid in the printing industry was partly the result of their lack of power
within the union and consequently within the arbitration system. It also reflected the
weakness of their industrial position before the court entered the wage-fixing arena. This
was especially crucial for female bookbinders, whose occupation had been recognised as
a skilled, apprenticeship trade in the eighteenth century. The subsequent decline of their
craft was the result of the failure to limit entry to apprenticeships, more than of deskilling
as a result of mechanisation and fragmentation. This failure was itself the consequence of
factors exogenous to the work process, principally the high turnover of female labour due
to women's domestic roles.49 The court's reluctance to revalue women's work in accord¬
ance with the criteria which it applied to male crafts reflected the conservative nature of
the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in general, and especially in the 1920s when the
whole system was under attack from non-Labor politicians. It also reflected the
masculinist and white supremacist political economy of the court judges, who gave low
priority to wage justice for women.

Given that women's work was so poorly paid, why did they not move into the better-
paid men's areas? Here the answer is also complex. The union's rules forbade the transfer
of female workers to male occupations without the approval of the board of manage¬
ment. Other structural constraints limited the kinds of work they could do. At the most


-----

obvious level, so called 'protective' clauses in the 1925 award limited the work which
females could do in printing firms. They were prohibited from working night shifts and
from working alone after six o'clock at night. This effectively kept them out of news¬
paper offices almost entirely. Females were forbidden to wash-up, clean or adjust print¬
ing machines, and to lift heavy weights; they were allowed to perform only the smallest
class of bronzing work and then for not more than two hours per day.50

Customs and practices evolved over the history of the industry also excluded women.
These included the practice of apprenticing only boys to men's trades, thus preventing
women from acquiring the skills necessary to perform the better-paid work. Equal pay
was the other major device used to exclude women from certain jobs. Male and female
schedules were listed separately in the awards of the court; where the female list con¬
tained no equivalent to work listed for men they were to be paid the male rate.51 The
authority of the court was thus given to long-standing practices in the industry which
before the awards were enforced by a combination of union regulation of members and
agreements with employers.

As we have seen, the role of the state in relation to the printing industry was generally
a conservative one, reinforcing the status quo. However, on the question of hours its role
was more radical, granting a general reduction of the working week by four hours in
1925. It is somewhat ironic that the female workers, whose interests were in many
respects neglected by the union, became the key element in the union's strategy to secure
a reduction in hours. Union officials were acutely aware of the court's record on this
question. Most pertinently, Judge Higgins had awarded a 44-hour week to the clothing
trades on the grounds that shorter hours would improve the health of female workers,
the future mothers of the race. Male workers also had their hours reduced so as to avoid
the disruption which would occur in factories if the two sexes worked different hours.52
Interpretations of the court's authority to set 'standard hours' for any industry also
favoured an appeal based on female hours.53 The union obviously had these precedents
in mind when it commissioned an enquiry into the health of female workers in the print¬
ing industry preparatory to going to court.54 It even went so far as to secure the services
of Dr Ethel Osborne, the same expert witness who had convinced Higgins of the necess¬
ity for shorter hours in the clothing case. The strategy paid off, the entire industry being
awarded forty-four hours. It is clear from their judgements that the health of the female
workers was the key to the decision. Dethridge and his fellow judges all accepted
Osborne's conclusions as being 'substantially correct' regarding the harmful effects of
employment in this industry on the health of women workers. And protecting women's
health was seen as being in the national interest.55

The state, represented by the Arbitration Court, thus brought to the workplace an
agenda wider than the interests of either employers or employees. On balance, however,
their decisions in the printing cases were more favourable to workers than employers.
And while male workers may not have made great advances under arbitration, they cer¬
tainly gained more than they would have under the Wages Board system.56 The possible
exception to this is the male bookbinders, who were forced to concede jealously guarded
territory to female labour in 1937. In general, though, the Arbitration Court protected
men's jobs from female competition by use of both protective clauses and equal pay.57


-----

The court also protected the work of craftsmen in another way. By refusing to 'classify'
certain aspects of a trade as less skilled, the court directly retarded the subdivision of the
labour process. Webb's refusal to classify further aspects of bookbinder's work as
unskilled delayed subdivision in this craft for a decade. Similarly, letterpress machinists
in New South Wales had their work subdivided when some of the platen machining was
given to non-tradesmen by the New South Wales court. The craft of the Victorian letter-
press machinist, by contrast, remained intact, protected by the award of the Common¬
wealth court. The employers' failure to have this work classified by the court in 1925
possibly discouraged further applications to have the work of other tradesmen
subdivided, particularly as Webb had stated it as a matter of principle that it was 'wrong'
for the court to classify occupations or 'to do anything else' calculated to break down
skilled trades.58

It is perhaps ironic that the more reluctant the signatories to the PIEUA amalgamation,
the more their sections gained from arbitration. The typographers and women
bookbinders, who were unenthusiastic, were better off under federal wage fixation. The
male bookbinders, who led the move for amalgamation, were also initially pleased with
the outcome of the arbitration case, believing that the court's endorsement of the existing
demarcation line had 'settled for all time' the right of male binders to turned-in work.59
The ensuing ten years saw them use the authority of the court with enthusiasm in their
campaign of 'unceasing vigilance' against female encroachments.60 They were, however,
much less enthusiastic about the court after the 1937 decision to concede significant
areas of stationery to female labour.

The cardboard-box makers, who also welcomed the prospect of federal arbitration,
had to wait until 1937 before experiencing significant benefits from the move. In that
year the long-awaited piecework schedule was ratified by the court, bringing uniformity
and accountability where in the past employers had had a virtual free hand in setting
domestic rates.61

It is not surprising that the compositors profited by the arrangement. The structure of
the federated union ensured that their interests received priority. What is surprising is
that the women bookbinders also did fairly well. The federal awards were more generous
than they could have expected under the Wages Boards. But in contrast to the composi¬
tors, this owed nothing to their position within the union. On the contrary, it occurred
in spite of their relatively powerless status. What gains they made must be largely
attributed to Magrath's advocacy and the strength of the female witnesses before the
court. As the board of management observed, 'the whole strength of a case depends on
the evidence [of the witnesses], and in this regard there was nothing left to be desired'.62
That they did not make even greater progress was due to the essentially conservative
nature of the court and the fact that the union as a whole was not prepared to make a
stand on wage justice for women.

###### Conclusion

In a discussion of methods of factory organisation, Stephen Wood and ]ohn Kelly have
argued that we cannot 'assign priority to a single factor in management strategy, whether
it be labour, technology or markets, but must determine such problems empirically'.1
Their conclusion parallels my own. Labour and product markets, technology, the supply
of capital, racial and gender orders and the activities of the state all affected the develop¬
ment of the labour process. These external factors shaped the options which faced man¬
agement in its decisions about the organisation of work. They likewise affected the way
in which workers responded, defining the parameters of a dynamic of work. As the sub¬
sequent discussion will argue, the interaction of all these factors, differently weighted,
produced a specific dynamic of work in each of the three industries studied.

Before returning to the operation of this dynamic, we need to review the major ways
in which work changed in these industries over the period from 1880 to World War II.
Firstly, can deskilling be identified as 'the major tendential presence within the develop¬
ment of the capitalist labour process'?2 If by deskilling we mean the breaking down of
complex tasks into a series of simpler operations, then the answer must be an unqualified
'yes'. In each branch of the clothing trade the major trend was for the making of gar¬
ments to be subdivided, firstly into cutting, sewing and pressing; secondly, into the
making of a narrower range of garments; and thirdly, into work on increasingly smaller
parts of each garment. This process of fragmentation operated unevenly, affecting
women's work more than men's, shirtmaking more than tailoring, sewing more than
pressing and pressing more than cutting. In bootmaking a similar process occurred.
Workers were initially divided into clickers, upper sewers, makers and finishers; then,
according to the type of shoes they made; and, finally, according to the kind of special¬
ised machine they operated. As with clothing, the process was uneven. The work of male


-----

clickers and female machinists was less fragmented than that of men making and finish¬
ing. Male printers were divided into linotype operators and hand compositors, each per¬
forming different aspects of the original compositor's work; stationery, cardboard-box
and paper-bag workers of both sexes had their work transformed from a relatively com¬
plex hand process to the more simple act of machine feeding. Mechanisation also affected
the work of male and female bookbinders, although subdivision affected women's work
more than men's.

However, as we have seen, it is not possible to formulate a simple equation between
fragmentation and deskilling. In objective terms, fragmentation usually involved a
degree of 'reskilling' because it was generally associated with mechanisation. Workers
needed retraining in order to perform under the new conditions. Thus, operating a
sewing machine is a different skill from wielding a needle and thread. Manipulating a
hide of leather on a stuff-cutting machine is a very different operation from cutting out
soles with a knife. And dealing with the noise and vibration of a pedal-operated stapling
machine was a far cry from the quiet, sedentary occupation of the hand book-sewer. The
skills employed were as different as those of the hand compositor and the linotypist. And
these examples are in addition to the more obvious cases of reskilling which arose out of
new processes, rather than new ways of doing old jobs. Print workers engaged on the
various forms of photo and colour reproduction are one instance of the former; boot
workers operating the new cement process introduced in the 1930s are another.

It might be argued, however, that although these skills associated with more mechan¬
ised production were different, they were intrinsically 'easier' and required less training
to acquire. To some extent this is true. A person who has had no prior experience of
either a needle and thread or a sewing machine would probably become useful on the
machine more quickly than with the needle. But an intrinsic part of the operation of
manufacturing machinery was speed, and this speed constitutes a separate element in
the assessment of skill. Intensification of work, or speeding-up, was a feature of each of
these industries in this period. Workers were required not just to produce accurate work,
but to produce this work more and more quickly. It was no use, for instance, being able
to guide pieces of cloth accurately through a machine: the worker had to be able to do
this quickly. To deny the crucial role of speed would be to argue that a two-finger typist,
who could produce accurate work given unlimited time, was 'skilled' in the same way as
a professional typist. Any deskilling, then, arising from the simplification (or narrowing
range) of tasks was offset by the increased speeds at which these tasks had to be
executed.

The situation is further complicated by the question of whether work was becoming frag¬
mented rather than specialised, the difference being that fragmented work requires less
skill whereas specialised work involves the concentration of skill on a narrower range of
tasks. Thus, the linotypist could be seen as a specialist compositor, one who has the same
training as a hand compositor but in addition has the ability to operate a typesetting
machine. By contrast, the maker of chocolate boxes at MacRobertson's factory may have
developed considerable expertise on one particular type of box, but was unable to get work
anywhere else because her skills were too specific. Since she lacked a general training in
making cardboard boxes, her work was fragmented rather than specialised.


-----

This distinction seems straightforward enough, but in practice it is not so clear. The
process whereby skills are socially constructed and given a value independent of any
objective features of work content operates also in the definition of work as fragmented
or specialised. The same processes which define certain work as skilled and unskilled
define work as specialised and fragmented. To return to the linotyping case: it could be
argued that the work the linotypist performed was, in fact, fragmented rather than
specialised. The work set on the machines was the 'straight matter', such as newspaper
articles. This was the simpler part of the general compositor's work. The more complex
part was the display work, which required judgement, and this was reserved for the
hand compositor. The pattern is a familiar one wherever machinery has been introduced
to craftwork: machines have been devised to perform the simpler tasks while the more
complex tasks have remained the province of the craftworker. Thus, in tailoring, the
machinist sews the seams while the tailor does the 'fitting', that part of the work requir¬
ing judgement. Objectively, then, the position of the linotypist is analogous to that of the
sewing machinist: they are both doing fragmented work. But, as we have seen,
linotypists became the elite of the printing trade, having both the highest rates of pay and
the highest status. Sewing machinists, on the other hand, had lower status than tailors
(and craft tailoresses) and were paid considerably less. Both kinds of work were frag¬
mented, but one was socially constructed as 'specialised' while the other was not. In
making generalisations about the general trend to fragmentation, then, it is important to
bear in mind that this has occurred even when status indicators might suggest otherwise.

In addition to the trend toward fragmentation and mechanisation, all three industries
showed an increased ratio of female to male workers. This process was also very uneven.
Tailoring experienced an influx of women in the late nineteenth century, but the trend
was halted in the early years of the twentieth century. In the other branches of the cloth¬
ing industry there was no increase in the proportion of women employed. On the con¬
trary, there were slightly more men engaged in the industry from the early twentieth
century. The proportion of women employed in boot and shoe making did not increase
significantly until the late 1890s. Thereafter, they rose slowly so that as a proportion of
total boot workers their numbers increased from about one-quarter in the 1890s to
almost a half in the 1930s. Printing also showed a general trend toward feminisation, the
most dramatic increases in women employed occurring in the period 1900-14.

With the exception of tailoring, though, feminisation did not mean that women were
moving into 'male' occupations. In both printing and bootmaking the increasing pro¬
portion of women employed reflected expansion in established women's occupations.
Thus, the growth of the cardboard-box industry provided more jobs for women in this
traditional women's industry. Faster methods of printing and the expansion of stationery
production similarly drew more women into 'women's' sections of these industries.
Women were likewise required in increasing numbers to fit and machine uppers in boot
factories. The mechanisation of men's bootmaking had no equivalent in the women's sec¬
tions: the only way for the uppers department to keep pace with the rest of a factory was
to employ more workers, and traditionally these were women. Where men were moving
into 'women's' industries (dressmaking, millinery, shirts, whitework), it was largely in
the capacity of supervisors and managers in an expanded factory system. Only in the


-----

case of cutting and design work were men clearly performing work which had formerly
been a female preserve.

A third aspect of work relates to the question of control. Did fragmentation mean dim¬
inished worker control over the labour process? Did the ways in which capitalists exer¬
cised control in the workplace change significantly? The earlier discussion on the
association between fragmentation, mechanisation and speed implies that workers
experienced diminished control over the way in which they performed their work. Cer¬
tainly, the breaking down of work into smaller parts inevitably left less room for dis¬
cretion. Likewise, machines limited the scope for individual variation in performing
tasks. The question of speed is more complex. In some circumstances increased pace did
reflect less control. The bootmaker who was too afraid to go out at night for fear of losing
speed the next day, and consequently his job, clearly had little control over the work
process. On the other hand were compositors and linotypists who worked quickly
in order to achieve high earnings on piece rates. They were not in danger of having
their piece rates cut because of these earnings, nor of losing their jobs or living wage
if they chose not to work so hard. Thus, speed can be considered an indication of loss
of job control only where workers faced dismissal or unacceptable loss of earnings for
being too slow. Unfortunately for the workers, very few were in the position of the elite
printers. The overwhelming majority of workers had little choice but to work as fast as
they could.

Was this loss of control a reflection of widespread adoption of scientific management
methods? In a few cases there is evidence of self-conscious and systematic application of
Taylorite ideas. The Pelaco factory is the most important example, although other shirt
factories also followed its lead. More common was ad hoc adaptation of American
methods to Australian conditions. Information gleaned from trade journals and from
management visits abroad was incorporated into factory organisation in Australia,
especially in the years immediately preceding and following World War I. The general
trend of these changes was towards scientific management principles: the separation of
conception and execution; the tying of fragmented work processes to particular
machines; and the selection of different types of workers to perform different types of
work. However, the transformation was a very uneven one and, in general, lagged
behind developments in the United States of America. Printing firms showed less inter¬
est in such schemes than clothing and boot factories. And when it came to implemen¬
tation, shirt factories were noticeably more successful than other kinds of clothing
manufacturers and boot producers. And throughout this period the clothing industry
included an alternative method of production to the factory system: domestic outwork.
The fact that outwork increased during the 1930s significantly qualifies any generalis¬
ation about the trend toward scientific management practices in these industries.

The existence of outwork also raises the question as to how far scientific management
was important as a method of labour control, as distinct from a system to maximise pro¬
ductivity by most effective use of resources. What role did scientific management play in
ensuring that workers worked hard, were careful with materials and did not engage in
collective opposition to their employers? The answer in the case of outwork is obvious.
It was irrelevant. Competition amongst outworkers and low piecework rates ensured


-----

that workers worked at a pace to satisfy contractors. Their isolation minimised the
possibilities of collective resistance.

Inside factories the situation was more complex. Scientific management techniques,
particularly payment by results and close supervision, encouraged workers to work
hard. These methods were, however, not the only ones employed, nor were they the most
important. Those firms most interested in Taylorism also adopted welfarist and
paternalist styles of management. In the context of the war, this was overlain with overt
patriotism. Managements thus hoped to subvert unionism amongst their workers by
encouraging employees to identify with the aims and methods of their employers. The
evidence suggests that this strategy was very effective.

The existence of rigid sexual divisions of labour, both in the home and the workplace,
also reduced the likelihood of collective opposition to management. Women's roles in the
home limited their participation in union affairs. In young single women the expectation
of marriage undermined militancy, adding to the problems inherent in organising young
and temporary workers. Older women with dependents, having experience of the limi¬
tations of marriage as a secure option to paid work, were generally more militant. How¬
ever, their dual role as homemakers and breadwinners left them little time for regular
union organisation. Mature single women, who formed the backbone of women's union
involvement in the twentieth century, were in a minority. Only in the tailoring section of
the clothing trade were they found in sufficient numbers to have any real impact.

Sexual divisions in the workplace undermined the tendency of factory production to
produce a more homogenised workforce. Men and women experienced work differently
because they did different jobs and were paid at different rates. These differences divided
workers, producing suspicion and hostility between the sexes. As the clothing and print¬
ing industries demonstrate, different experiences of work prevented a common strategy
to combat the intensification and fragmentation of work.

The interaction between the domestic gender order and the sexual segregation of paid
work also prevented any general movement amongst workers to raise the level of female
wages. Such general increases were seen as a threat to the earnings of male breadwin¬
ners, and were opposed by most men and some women. The clothing and boot indus¬
tries demonstrated this logic most overtly.

Authority patterns within the patriarchal family were also used to reinforce the control
of employers over employees. Younger workers were placed under the supervision of
older workers, and women under the supervision of men. A common practice in the
nineteenth century, it continued with the move to more 'modern' methods of factory
management. Male tailors, for instance, were placed in charge of teams of females doing
subdivided work. And implicit in the paternalist style of companies such as Pelaco and
Lucas was the rhetoric of 'the family firm', with its appeal to patriarchal patterns of auth¬
ority as well as familial loyalties. 'The family', however, could also act against manage¬
ment control. An injustice to one worker could invoke the wrath of other family
members. However, the fact that firms continued to employ family imagery in their deal¬
ings with workers suggests that, on balance, it reinforced the authority of management.

At another level, the transference of domestic patterns of gender relations to the
workplace acted against an independent movement of female workers. This was most


-----

noticeable in the boot industry, where the proximity of factories to workers' homes meant
a higher incidence of members of the same family working together than was the case for
either the clothing or printing industries. This retarded female involvement in union
affairs because men assumed this responsibility on their behalf. Similar situations
occurred, although in less extreme form, in the other two industries. Men occupied pos¬
itions of authority even when in a minority in a union. Unions thus pursued policies
which suited the male membership, and these were not necessarily in the best interests of
female workers. Different work experiences created different interests, while sexual poli¬
tics helped ensure that men's interests received precedence.

A further way in which control of the workforce was maintained is in the area
described by Burawoy as 'games'. There is evidence that such practices did occur and that
they helped workers accept the new system of working. Thus, linotype operators prided
themselves on their speeds and their earnings. They clearly had no interest in challeng¬
ing a system which they were able to turn to their own advantage. Where working at
high speed might otherwise be considered a hardship, in the linotypists' case it was used
to bolster the status of men whose work could potentially have been classed as deskilled.
In the clothing trade, competitions organised by supervisors encouraged workers to
work hard, but in this case the rewards were more modest: sixpence or a box of lollies
was considered sufficient incentive. In the boot trade, races also took place between
workers, the only reward being the status attached to the accolade of 'race-horse'. With
the exception of the linotypists, however, it is doubtful that such methods were an
important and enduring form of 'manufacturing consent'. Unions were alert to their sig¬
nificance and officially opposed such practices.

There is one other way in which employers maintained control over their workers: via
the discipline of the market. Thompson has argued that the relation of ownership itself is
insufficient to secure management control over the labour process.3 This is not always
true. In the boot and clothing industries during the depression of the late 1920s and
1930s, for example, the most powerful control over workers was the fear of unemploy¬
ment. Scientific management may have been needed to make more efficient use of
resources, but it was not needed to discipline the workforce. The market did that.

Finally, there is the question of payment and conditions. Were the years between 1880
and 1939 marked by continuous improvement in these respects, from the workers' point
of view? The two severe depressions of the 1890s and 1930s make nonsense of such a
suggestion. The continuing realities of underemployment in industries like bootmaking,
even in relatively prosperous times, also make generalisations about earnings very diffi¬
cult. Official rates of pay were one thing; actual earnings were quite another. Some gen¬
eral trends are, however, evident. Inside factories there was a marked decline in legal
hours of work. Factory legislation of the 1870s and 1880s had limited the hours which
women and juveniles could work to forty-eight per week. This was extended to men
under the first Wages Board determinations around the turn of the century. Linotypists
were the most favoured, working only forty-two hours under the 1901 printers' determi¬
nation. The next reduction in hours occurred under the auspices of the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court. Clothing workers secured a 44-hour week in 1919, followed by boot
workers in 1921 and the printing industry in 1927.


-----

Payment for public holidays was also an innovation in these years. This was provided
for under the Wages Boards during the first decades of the twentieth century, and
was incorporated in the federal awards for each industry. Paid annual leave was not
legally provided for, with the exception of the printing industry which secured this con¬
cession in 1937. In a few cases, however, employers did provide paid holidays of their
own accord.

The five-day working week also became more common in the period beginning with
World War I. This became standard practice in the clothing and boot trades in the inter¬
war period, although the printing industry was more resistant to the change. Some
employers converted to five days in the early 1920s, only to revert to Saturday morning
work as well later in the decade.

Physical conditions in factories showed general improvement. The sewering of Mel¬
bourne from the 1890s and the provincial cities in the 1920s made factories healthier and
more pleasant places to work. New factories, especially those built in the expansionary
years following federation and the war, provided better lighting and ventilation. Some
firms also provided dining-rooms in the pre-war period, and this became more general
in the 1920s. In isolated cases, facilities for workers even ran to pianos, radios and sport¬
ing equipment. However, alongside these 'model' factories, there were still many of the
'backyard' variety. Operating in unlined tin sheds, workers endured seasonal extremes
of temperature and the company of vermin. Such establishments were particularly
common in the boot and clothing industries, with conditions deteriorating in the 1930s
depression. And no matter whether the factory was a shed or a brick edifice, few
employers appreciated the importance of providing their workers with comfortable seat¬
ing in this period.

The question of workers' health and safety is a separate study in itself and has been
touched on here only as it relates to workers' experience of their work. However, the evi¬
dence suggests that better ventilation and safety procedures in factories were offset by
problems arising out of changed work processes. Thus, women working in printing fac¬
tories may have been exposed to less fumes, but they had to operate machines at high
speed which caused considerable jarring to the body. The increased pace of work in all
industries seems to have caused physical stress to workers.

On the question of wage rates and earnings, it is also possible to draw some tentative
conclusions. Real wages (both rates and earnings) declined from the late 1880s to the late
1890s. They recovered in the first three decades of the twentieth century, exceeding the
early 1880s level by the end of the war. These levels were eroded by inflation in the post¬
war period, although they recovered again in the 1920s before falling in the depression.
They rose in the late 1930s, but not to their mid-1920s levels. Within this general pattern,
however, there were important variations. Male bootmakers suffered a general decline in
earnings from the 1890s. Although this decline was arrested by the 1910 arbitration
award, bootmakers' real wages did not improve significantly in the period to World War

II. Indeed, they fell in relation to the wages of other skilled tradesmen. The earnings of
outworkers in the clothing trade declined in the early twentieth century when those of
inside workers were increasing. They were also slower to share in the post-depression
recovery in the 1930s. And the fact that more juveniles were employed during the


-----

depression contributed to the general decline in workers' earnings in this decade. How¬
ever, it must be stressed that these are tentative conclusions only. More definitive state¬
ments would need to be based on extensive analysis of the cost of living in comparison to
actual rather than nominal pay rates, making appropriate allowance for short-time and
seasonal unemployment.

How were all these changes to work determined? At the most fundamental level they
were precipitated by changes in product markets. Thus, the stagnation of markets for
boots in the late 1870s and early 1880s precipitated the valorisation crisis which led to
employer attempts to cheapen production by cutting labour rates. However, as this same
case illustrates, the market precipitates change but it does not determine the direction
which that change will take. The employers' response to the crisis of valorisation was to
cut piece rates, which in turn led to a 'crisis of exploitation' from the point of view of the
workers. Their strategy to relieve this crisis included the elimination of outwork. The suc¬
cess of this strategy depended on the sexual division of labour within the homes of the
workers, whereby it was women rather than men who took responsibility for the daily
and generational reproduction of the workforce. With the move to factory production,
workers had greater ability to resist rate-cutting. This led to a new valorisation crisis for
the employers. The drawing in of all workers under the factory roof had provided them
with the circumstances in which to implement a new strategy to cut production costs:
mechanisation and subdivision. This move, accompanied as it was by severe economic
depression, led to another 'crisis of exploitation' for workers. But this time they had
exhausted their industrial bargaining power. The strategy instead became political: they
turned to the legislature for relief. The Wages Board, however, proved a disappointment.
It failed to regulate boy labour which, combined with subdivision, steadily eroded
the bootmaker's claim to skilled status. The federal Arbitration Court was more
co-operative. It prescribed a broad-based form of apprenticeship and restricted the
number of boys entering the trade, thus reinstating men's bootmaking occupations
amongst the skilled trades. The price they paid for this arrangement was acceptance of a
margin for skill below that generally paid to other tradesmen. Women's wages, not being
within the court's jurisdiction, were also kept below rates in comparable occupations.
This system was accepted by a majority of employers and employees for the next two
decades. Acceptance was based on a general expansion of the industry, as manufacturers
took advantage of leased machinery and easy credit to try for a share of the booming
wartime market. However, contraction in the market for boots in the 1920s precipitated
another valorisation crisis. As this crisis deepened with the onset of general depression
late in the decade, employers took the initiative. Where possible, they employed new
technology (such as the cement process) to cheapen production. More generally, they
successfully intensified, or speeded up, work. This again led to a crisis of exploitation as
workers reacted against these moves to cheapen further what was already comparatively
cheap male labour. Again their solution was an appeal to the adjudication of the state in
the form of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The court's decision in 1938 fore¬
shadowed radical change to existing practices in the industry.

A similar pattern emerged in the clothing industry, although this was more complex
because of the three distinct branches involved. All three branches, however, were


-----

influenced to varying degrees by the major shift in the product market from order gar¬
ments to those sold ready-made. Without this shift there would have been no substantial
development in the factory system of production. All three branches also shared a labour
market with common features: a largely female workforce, a significant number of
whom were willing or needed to carry out work in their own homes. This meant that
when product markets contracted and manufacturers looked for ways to cut costs, more
extensive use of outdoor labour was usually the simplest option. Intensifying the work of
indoor workers occurred at the same time, but was generally not as effective in cutting
costs as outwork. Most concerted attempts at intensifying inside work, however,
occurred in times of market expansion. The years immediately following federation, the
war years and the 1920s were thus the periods of most dramatic innovation in clothing
production. In this case experimentation was a strategy to expand production with a
female labour force which was not expanding at the same rate.

In contrast to the situation in the boot trade, there was no strong dialectic between
employer initiatives and workers' responses in the clothing trades. The sexual division of
labour in the home, which made outwork an attractive source of income for women with
domestic duties, prevented this kind of dynamic. Workers in factories had little room to
manoeuvre as long as employers had the option of sending work outside.

The only branch where workers did have an active input in the shaping of work pro¬
cesses was the tailoring section. In this case, state legislation in the form of prescribed
piece rates (under both Wages Boards and federal Arbitration Court) limited the role of
outwork. Before this occurred, however, men in the industry were fighting a losing battle
against the use of cheaper female labour to reduce the cost of tailoring. The stagnation of
clothing markets in the late 1870s and 1880s caused a crisis of valorisation for clothing
manufacturers in the same way as it had for boot employers. Men's labour was the most
expensive engaged in tailoring, and the strategy adopted by employers to cheapen it was
to adopt simpler, more subdivided work processes and to use women instead of men on
this work. This occurred both inside and outside factories. They also sought to cut rates
paid to these female workers. The result was an 'exploitation crisis' for workers. In the
1880s this erupted in the tailoresses' strike, which checked piece-rate cutting in the short
term, but eventually failed to maintain earnings as employers turned increasingly to out¬
work in the late 1880s and 1890s. For male tailoring workers, the crisis produced a deter¬
mination to exclude women from the trade. This was expressed in union organisation in
the 1890s. It was also a major motive behind their support for Wages Boards. Their strat¬
egy was to limit outwork so as to curtail the extension of female labour outside the fac¬
tories and 'legitimate' workrooms, whilst campaigning for equal pay to prevent further
incursions on the work of inside male workers. As we have seen, this strategy effectively
stopped the trend toward female labour in the making of tailored garments.

In the twentieth century, official representatives of the clothing union (all of whom
were men) accepted scientific management as the only alternative to sweated outwork
and the feminisation of tailoring. Indeed, they encouraged employers to experiment with
such methods so as to forestall these developments. The expanded factory system offered
plenty of employment at both craft and supervisory levels for men. But this solution also
had an inbuilt contradiction: there was a gap between the official's perceptions and the


-----

actual work experience of the female members. Thus, female clothing workers experi¬
enced a further 'crisis of exploitation' which led to a challenge to methods of manufac¬
ture such as the 1935 strike of Melbourne trouser machinists.

Employers in the printing industry were at times also anxious to reduce the cost of
their male workforce, most of whom received skilled rates of pay. In the 1880s, for
instance, the recovery of the printing trade had encouraged many craftsmen to go into
business on their own accord, as the capital required was not great. In the early 1880s
there was therefore an expanding market but also an increasing number of competing
firms. Reducing costs became important if firms were to get a share of the orders. How¬
ever, the industry was not generally suitable for domestic production. This meant that
any attempts to introduce women to do 'men's' work usually met with successful resist¬
ance from tightly organised male workers. Boy labour was also tried, and although this
was generally more widespread, especially in small jobbing offices and country news¬
papers, it was checked by the opposition of unions and large employers. The pressures of
competition in the early and mid-1880s were not sufficiently strong, however, for
employers to pursue drastic changes in methods of production. Only with the economic
downturn from 1889 did they look more seriously at ways of reducing costs. Thus, in
1891, male bookbinders were forced to concede a small area of work to female labour. It
was also in the 1890s that linotype machines were brought in to cheapen the costs of
composition, and mechanised production of cloth-casing cheapened bookbinding.

Other major changes to work processes in printing also occurred because of limitations
on the use of female labour. The rapid expansion of the bookbinding, stationery and
cardboard-box industries in the early years of the twentieth century, fuelled by new
printing technologies, occurred at a time when the supply of female workers was
inadequate to meet the expanding demands of industry. The installation of folding,
sewing and gluing machinery in this period enabled machines to keep pace with the
output of men's sections of factories without employers having to extend the use of more
expensive male workers to traditionally female areas. When the stationery trade experi¬
enced market pressure in the 1930s as a result of import competition, further technologi¬
cal innovation was not a solution: manufacturers were already using the most modern
equipment available. The extension of female labour was again seen as a solution. The
union was predictably resistant to this suggestion. Male bookbinders were already feel¬
ing threatened by the shifting market demand for loose-leaf filing systems (women's
work) in preference to bound account books (men's work). The state, however, inter¬
vened: the Commonweath Arbitration Court declared a movement in the Tine of demar¬
cation' in bookbinding which expanded the range of work which could be performed by
cheaper female labour.

The same factors which account for change in work processes and conditions also
account for continuities. Where the market was the key factor in precipitating change, it
was also the most important limiting factor on innovation. Specifically, the small size of
the Australian consumer market, and the limited extent of export trade, placed practical
constraints on product specialisation and mass production. This was the major reason
that the boot and clothing industries lagged behind developments in countries with mass
markets, such as the United States. The extreme seasonality of markets for boots and


-----

clothing also discouraged the installation of expensive equipment which might lie idle for
months of the year. This consideration was, however, offset to some extent in the boot
trade with the use of leased machinery.

Labour markets could also constrain innovation, both directly and indirectly. In the
boot trade, for instance, shortages of women for factory work discouraged employers
fronj using female labour in place of men on subdivided work. Shortages of skilled
female machinists in the early 1920s also deterred manufacturers from introducing a
system of classification aimed at breaking down male skills. On this occasion, it was not
that they intended to use women on men's work, but rather that employers feared a
strike of female machinists in defence of their fellow workers and relatives.

Developments in technology and technical expertise also placed limits on productive
innovation. In the printing trade, for instance, the use of linotype machines in jobbing
offices was restricted by the unsuitability of the machines for display work. The clothing
trade was similarly limited in its use of motive power before the widespread use of elec¬
tricity from the early twentieth century. Alternative nineteenth-century sources of power
were either more expensive and less reliable (gas) or not suited to fast, light sewing
machines (steam). The delay in developing sophisticated cutting machines for both cloth¬
ing and boots similarly retarded mechanisation of these processes until well into the
twentieth century.

In the Australian context, the state also played an important role in limiting productive
innovation which was aimed at deskilling and/or feminisation of the workforce. Tariffs
which protected local industries such as clothing and boots against import competition
reduced the incentive to become more 'efficient'. Taxes on imported machinery also dis¬
couraged local manufacturers from employing the latest technology. Protective legis¬
lation which excluded women and juveniles from certain types of work, together with
Wages Board and arbitration awards for equal pay on 'men's' work, removed one of the
major incentives to subdivide work: the opportunity to employ cheaper, untrained
workers on the separate parts.

Limitations on the proportion of juveniles which could be employed had a similar
effect. These were especially effective when combined with apprenticeship provisions.
Provided under both the state Apprenticeship Act and the federal arbitration awards,
these ensured that some workers received a broad-based training even when
subsequently employed on subdivided work. This reinforced their status as skilled
workers, and their claims to higher rates of pay. Thus, linotypists underwent a six- or
seven-year apprenticeship although only one year of this was actually devoted to learn¬
ing to use the typesetting machine. Male bootmakers and workers of both sexes engaged
in tailoring also had provision for such general training. The state's reinforcement of
these workers' claims to craft status removed the incentive to fragment the labour process
even further where the major benefit was the employment of cheaper labour. The Arbi¬
tration Court's reluctance to classify work, with different rates of pay for the 'less skilled'
sections, had a similar effect.

At a more general level, the gender order (divisions of labour in the home and
workplace; ideologies of men's and women's place and constructions of masculinity and
femininity) also narrowed the options of manufacturers who contemplated productive


-----

reorganisation. Protective legislation which limited the types and hours of women's
work was a product of this gender order (and also reinforced it). The low wages paid to
women also arose out of their association with reproduction and domestic labour. In an
industry such as clothing, where the overwhelming majority of workers was female,
moves to cheapen labour were of less value than in men's industries because labour was
already so cheap. The only significant savings occurred where juveniles could be
employed in place of adults.

Constructions of femininity deterred some employers from employing women on
work which was considered masculine. The case of the 'Amazons' in the pressing room is
the major instance of this. However, employers in all three trades were influenced by
ideas about respectability, the definition of which had clear gender dimensions. Work
perceived as 'unrespectable' or 'unfeminine' would be less likely to attract female labour.
This affected manufacturing employers in the twentieth century because office and sales
work offered more 'feminine' employment to young women. There were thus fewer
women available for employers to use in any moves to replace men. The need to appear
respectable in order to attract female labour also constrained employers in the types of
work on which they could employ women. In the boot factories, for instance, employers
were very reluctant to engage in the 'disgusting' American practice of employing the
sexes side by side. This effectively meant women's confinement to the machining and
packing rooms. Similarly, the breadwinner-dependent model of most working-class
families provided the material base for a determined effort on the part of men (and some
women) to exclude women from 'men's' jobs and so preserve the income of the male
breadwinner. Again, this economic motivation was reinforced by less tangible desires to
maintain the existing gender division of labour and hence men's masculine
self-definitions.

The limitations imposed by the availability of capital are obvious. In the nineteenth
century, when most firms relied on reinvested profits and family finance, large-scale
expenditure on expensive plant and machinery was not an option for many. Likewise,
when economic recessions encouraged employers to innovate, the same pressures gener¬
ally restricted the availability of credit and investment capital from banks and
shareholders.

These factors acted together to construct the site for management and worker struggles
over the shape of work. Employers do not generally have an inbuilt propensity to change
the manufacturing process. If profits are steady they are unlikely to seek drastic changes. It
is only when profits are threatened—when a valorisation crisis occurs—that they look for
ways to increase productivity. But although the recognition of a valorisation crisis might be
a simple matter, the solution to the crisis was never obvious. Many manufacturers were
deterred from innovation by realistic assessments of the obstacles before them.

The few cases where manufacturers did adopt thoroughgoing Taylorist systems
involved employers who were unusually determined and able to overcome these limi¬
tations. Thus, the Pelaco shirt company was able to adopt mass-production techniques
by specialising in one fairly standard product. Energetic marketing and strict quality con¬
trol ensured that Pelaco received a large share of the otherwise limited Australian mar¬
ket. Unlike tailors, workers in the shirt industry (almost all of whom were women) had


-----

not been able to secure either a broad-based apprenticeship or effective restrictions on
juniors. The restrictions which did exist were easily avoided by Law's strategy of putting
all his workers on piecework. The adoption of a paternalistic style of management
ensured that his small staff of permanent workers acquiesced in his production methods.
Clearly, these were not tactics which could be adopted by more than a minority of firms:
neither the product market nor the labour market could sustain such methods.

The same is true for workers. All other things being equal, inactivity is the easiest
course. It is only when exploitation arising out of changed work processes reaches un¬
acceptably high levels, or threatens to reach these levels, that they respond. However, the
assessment of what is acceptable or unacceptable is a subjective matter. This is especially
important since workers' input to the shaping of work needs to be collective to be effec¬
tive. In what circumstances does a group of workers arrive at a common decision that
something needs to be done? It is clearly not simply a matter of the degree of exploi¬
tation. If that were so, female outworkers would be among the most militant instead of
the least militant. Obviously, there needs to be a certain level of association between
workers so that they can appreciate their common lot. The isolation of outworkers in the
clothing trade, and their resulting passivity, was thus a powerful factor ensuring the con¬
tinuity of the outwork system.

Another important ingredient in workers' perceptions of exploitation and their pro¬
posed strategies to overcome it was the influence of radical political ideologies. Anarch¬
ists such as Chummy Fleming and communists active in both the clothing and boot
industries in the 1930s helped to channel workers' experiences into active protest against
the existing system.

In a slightly different vein, the popularity of Taylorism amongst sections of the post¬
war international socialist movement4 may have influenced socialist union officials such
as Alf Wallis to advocate scientific management for the clothing industry. At the same
time, workers espousing ideologies which questioned the acceptance of Taylorism and
related versions of 'efficient' management were sometimes not in a position to influence
the direction of organised labour's response. Thus, Lesbia Harford, a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World, and May Brodney, an unorthodox socialist, drew on
ideologies which did question the efficiency of scientific management from the worker's
point of view.5 Their feminism and shopfloor experience also made them more sensitive
to the implications of management decisions for female workers. But, although they were
aware of the potential of scientific management to increase exploitation of workers, their
influence was less than that of men such as Wallis because of the structured
powerlessness of women within the union hierarchy. It took a further two decades for
the experience of women workers to generate conclusions similar to those arrived at
theoretically by Harford and Brodney. Only then did shopfloor militancy pose a chal¬
lenge to management initiatives to fragment work.

As each of these cases illustrates, work was shaped by a progressive dynamic between
the capitalist imperative to extract surplus value, the workers' desire to resist exploitation,
the intervention of the state, advancements in technology, and the availability of capital.
And this dynamic operated within the shifting parameters of product and labour mar¬
kets, and the less flexible dictates of the gender order.

Note: The numbers of men engaged in bootmaking are slightly under-represented because of the persistence of outwork for
certain lines (e.g. strong work). The Census gives the following figures.

Males Females
1881 6,469 447
1891 6,838 816
1901 6,361 1,157

However, these are overestimates of male employment, as repairers are included. Females, on the other hand, are
under-represented, especially in 1881, because of the inclusion of many probable employees in the category 'shoemaker's wife'
(there were 770 so designated in 1881) and 'sewing machinist'.

fThe figures for 1886-1901 are derived from CIF Reports. There were no reports before 1886. The percentage of females
employed in 1881 was probably higher than the 5.3 indicated by the Census because of the inclusion of working proprietors,
almost all of whom were males.

reflects the movement of men into cutting positions within the factory system.

argues that the defeat of Taylorism by working-class opposition led to the employment of these
more subtle forms of control in addition to scientific management.

lines, maintaining that fragmented work is not intrinsically less skilled than non-fragmented work
but that because women tend to be employed in fragmented work to a greater extent than men, such
work is considered less skilled.

nately, Hall does not give a sex-breakdown of his statistics.
25 Davison, Marvellous Melbourne, pp. 193-4, discusses the effect of the goldrush children on rates of
marriage. The point he makes about the time lag in the arrival of boys of marriageable age
compared to girls (because of the difference in age at marriage) is pertinent here. The continuing
effect of this would, however, have been offset somewhat by the high level of immigration amongst
adult males in the 1880s. See Hall, Stock Exchange of Melbourne, p. 52.

28 Sinclair, 'Women and Economic Change in Melbourne', pp. 278-91. Sinclair does not consider mar¬
ried women as he finds this causes confusion. On the contrary, the fact that the proportion of mar¬
ried to unmarried women 'changes markedly because of the unstable age composition of the
Australian population' (p. 279) is illuminating in its own right.

vests and trousers) but were paid an average of 27 shillings per week compared to 50 shillings paid
to the men.

conditions of women's labour market which make them non-militant, and that men similarly situ¬
ated in the labour market behave in the same way. My evidence obviously does not support these
conclusions.

1 For a history of the firm, see H. P. Down, A Century in Printing: The Story of Sands and McDougall Pty
Ltd During Its First Hundred Years 1853-1953, Melbourne 1956, p. 30.
2 Descriptions of work in the following pages are drawn from various sources, particularly J. Ramsay
McDonald, Women in the Printing Trades, New York and London, 1980 (first published 1904), pp.
1-16. Although the work process was much the same in Australia as in the UK, the sexual division
of labour was slightly different and mechanisation was less advanced. The Bookbinders Union
Rules and Minutes and the Report of CIF have been used to identify which workers performed
which processes in Australia.

3 The division of labour at Sands and McDougall's was characteristic of large city firms. Small
country binderies, however, employed one man who did the work throughout: 1901 Factory RC,

9 The seasons in the printing industry were slightly different to those in boots and clothing, which
had their downturns in the first and third quarters of the year. Printers were usually busy in the
third and fourth quarters but slack from Christmas until mid-year.

55 Typo. Jn., November 1898, p. 8. Hancock's argument that weekly wages made for more 'brotherli¬

time, as Hagan and Fisher imply, but was made in 1911—long after the issue was settled.
56 Typo. Jn., November 1898, p. 9. This argument was also used, however, by opponents of piece rates
who feared that those on the 'better papers' would 'go for each one making the biggest pile and

[drag] others down in the process': ibid, p. 8. It was this argument, in fact, which persuaded Can¬
adian compositors to insist on time rates. See G. S. Kealey, 'Work control, the labour process and
nineteenth century Canadian printers', in Heron and Storey (eds), On the Job, p. 89.

3 Before 1928, the Act stipulated that no party could be represented by counsel or solicitor or paid
agent without the permission of all parties; Anderson, Fixation of Wages, pp. 35-6. After 1928 it was
possible for such people to appear at the discretion of the court.
4 It should be noted, however, that the normal rules of evidence applying in courts of law did not
operate in the Arbitration Court; see J. H. Portus, Australian Compulsory Arbitration 1900-1970,

Workers of the World', Radical America, vol. 8, no. 6, 1975, pp. 69-94, discusses the IWW's position
on this point. Brodney's politics were rather idiosyncratic. However, she consistently opposed scien¬
tific management from her first encounter with a 'machine telltale' before World War I to the 1950s
when she gave a radio talk on the subject. See Brodney Papers, LTL.
