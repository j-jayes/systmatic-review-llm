## The Chinese Coal Industry:

## An Economic History

The coal industry has been and continues to be of critical importance to China' s economic modernization. With its huge labour force, countrywide infrastructure, and  vital  strategic  importance  to  the  economy,  the  industry  presents  special problems for reformers. It also epitomizes the problems of reform in the state industrial sector as a whole.

This book examines the changes in the structure and operation of the Chinese coal industry from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, concentrating on the years of reform. Although the focus is on the economics of the industry, The Chinese Coal Industry: An Economic History also provides many insights into China's sociopolitical development.

## Some explanatory notes

## Statistics

## Pitfalls and shortcomings

- -figures  deliberately  inflated  or  deflated  by  low  level  bureaucrats  trying  to get some message across to superiors. For example, in order to get bonuses they would report that the targets were reached when they weren't, or they would under-report to try to get more funding next year, etc.
- -figures for public consumption at home or abroad, deliberately inflated or deflated by authorities, for example, downplaying of accidents.
- -discrepancies in figures supplied by Chinese official sources, for example, many typos, and variations found in the statistical yearbooks.
- -much fuller information given in Chinese sources, for example, English and Chinese versions of the Coal Industry Y earbook.
- -discrepancies in figures from the international organizations, for example, World Bank, International Energy Agency, etc.
- -all figures from the non-state mines are estimates, for example, great variation in the approximate number of mines, and their output.
- -international comparisons complicated by geopolitical changes, for example, collapse of Soviet Union and creation of CIS.

## Gaps

- -no central administration of statistics before 1949. All that exists are some regional,  local,  and  individual  mine  records,  some  data  compiled  by  the Geological Survey of China, and by individual researchers often hired by commercial enterprises who used the usual quantitative techniques of extrapolation for periods when there was absolutely no data at all.
- -governmental statistics collection, analysis, and publication had been carried out  in  the  early  years  of  the  PRC,  but  ended  with  the  GLF  and  was  not resumed by the State Statistical Bureau until 1981.
- -only four editions of the Zhongguo nengyuan tongji nianjian (China Energy Statistics Y earbook) were published: 1986, 1989, 1991, and 1991-96.
- -the hiatus between collection of figures and publishing of them.

## Problems in translation

- -in material translated in China, precise meanings and/or nuance were often not clear.

## Measurements

- -'tons' means metric tons.

## Romanizations

- -the pinyin system of romanization has been used throughout, with the exception of some place and company names in Chapter 1.

## Introduction

One of the main constraining factors in China' s quest to raise living standards, modernize, and become a major world power has been a persistent shortage of energy. More than twenty years after Deng Xiaoping launched the reform and 'opening up' programme in 1978, per capita energy consumption is still less than half of the average for what the World Bank categorizes as 'lower middle-income economies', and about an eighth of what it is for 'high-income economies'. As the main source of energy in China has always been coal, whether for electric power generation, railway transport, an input to a vast array of industries, or as the principal heating fuel in the residential and commercial sectors, the energy shortage problem until the mid-1990s was essentially a coal industry problem, difficulties or bottlenecks having occurred at all stages - production, transportation, or conversion to other energy forms.

Energy shortages have greatly hindered the industrial, agricultural, and social development of China. They have caused tremendous financial losses in foregone potential production and foreign investment. Capital spent on machinery that has been damaged by power failures, or which was forced to operate at only a fraction of its capacity, has been wasted. The lack of an alternative to coal has perpetuated the gathering of burnable vegetation in the rural areas, resulting in the permanent loss of millions of acres of once fertile land through erosion, and thereby greatly contributing to recurring and devastating floods.

Since 1989 China has been by far the world' s largest producer and consumer of coal. In approximate terms, China' s 1,001.9 billion tons of proven coal reserves represent  50  per  cent  of  the  world  total.  However,  only  114.5  billion  tons  are classified  as  proven recoverable reserves,  representing  about  11  per  cent  of the world total, third largest after the Commonwealth of Independent States and the United States, which each have about 23 per cent. About 74 per cent of the reserves are bituminous, 13 per cent anthracite, and 13 per cent lignites. Some 83 per cent of the total can be used as steam coals, the remainder as coking and gas coals.

While coal use in the developed world peaked in the first decades of the 1900s, and after the Second World War was being replaced with higher efficiency energy forms - oil, gas, and later hydro and nuclear electric power - China' s use of coal reached its zenith only in the late 1990s. There was no foreign exchange with

which to import oil and gas, and domestic supplies of these were no where near sufficient. In 1949, being a poor, war-exhausted communist country, in fear of foreign domination and exploitation, and under a United Nations embargo, it had no option but to depend on coal as the main source of energy.

The government of the People's Republic did make efforts to replace coal, this relatively low-grade and inconvenient fuel. For a brief period in the 1960s China' s oil production ranked among the highest in the world and there was great optimism that new major finds would be discovered. Some consumption equipment was actually converted to the use of oil during those years, but as no new large and easily exploitable fields were found China was forced to revert to coal and to export what oil there was to earn desperately needed foreign exchange. Though there was abundant hydropower potential, materials and technology were sufficient to build only small- and medium-sized plants. Similarly, uranium deposits were adequate, but lack of capital, expertise, and long construction lead-times precluded the nuclear power option.

When  the  reform  and  opening  up  programme  began  in  the  late  1970s,  the Chinese leadership reviewed its energy options, and concluded a switch to the more modern and efficient fuels would still have to be deferred. While political and security considerations were now less significant factors, costs continued to be a formidable deterrent. Switching from one fuel to one or more other fuels would  require  huge  investments  in  new  equipment  and  technology.  The  fear attached  to  the  displacement  of  a  very  large  work  force  was  probably  another factor. It was not until the mid-1990s that there were clear indications that the government was ready to begin a gradual phasing out of the use of coal.

The evolution of the coal industry in China constitutes an important case study because it mirrors the country' s economic development as a whole, first with the initial industrialization by foreign capitalists, then a brief period of Soviet-style central planning, followed by several decades of Mao' s 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', including two sociopolitical campaigns which led to widespread loss of life and economic breakdown. Then Deng Xiaoping initiated his reform and opening up programme for which there was no blueprint, indeed not even complete agreement among the leadership. Pervasive corruption in government and great disparities in living standards developed very quickly, contributing to mass social unrest and ultimately many deaths near Tiananmen Square in 1989. At the time of writing, the coal industry, indeed the economy as a whole, is in a  highly  precarious state with overwhelming rates of unemployment combined with ever increasing awareness of Western living standards.

Most analysts would agree that the non-grain agricultural and consumer goods sectors have been virtually fully marketized, and quite successfully so, but that the economic reform of the state industrial sector has lagged far behind. Raising the output, productivity, and profit levels of the state enterprises, where the labour force  is  very  large  and  many  layers  of  government  are  involved,  is  proving extremely difficult. In the cases of sectors it considers strategic, such as energy, transportation,  and  telecommunications,  the  government  has  been  particularly cautious about restructuring and opening up to foreign investment.

China's enormous size, population, and diversity make the country' s economic problems  unique,  and  the  Chinese  government  had  to  devise  its  own  plan  for development. It could learn from the successes and failures of other countries, particularly from the other formerly centrally planned economies, but could not integrate into its own strategy the entire administrative and regulatory framework of  any  one  country.  It  was  obliged  to  develop  incrementally  and  suffer  some inevitable setbacks resulting from economic experimentation.

China embarked on a radical, though gradual economic transformation with the  introduction  of  the  reform  programme  in  late  1978,  by  which  time  it  had become all too apparent that Mao' s adaptation of Soviet central planning and his revolutionary  motivational  schemes  were  not  working.  Deng  Xiaoping  called for separation of the responsibilities of government and enterprise, incentives for efficiency, and accountability. Opening up of China to the world in order that the Chinese could interact with and learn from other countries and, most importantly, attract foreign investment and technological aid was a top priority. This necessitated developing internationally acceptable standards in the financial and legal sectors,  a  process  which  is  still  far  from  complete.  Of  paramount  importance, however, was that the reforms in no way lead to an exploitation of the Chinese people  and/or  their  resources  by  foreign  countries,  nor  to  a  widening  of  the difference in income levels between rural and urban areas. This last condition has proved impossible to meet.

After more than twenty years of reforms, the government's principal tenet is still public ownership. One of the main messages of the 15th National Congress, held in September 1997, was that the policy of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  must  be  continued.  Socialism  was  re-confirmed  as  the  primary stage of the ultimate economic goal, communism. However, it was recognized that  the  concept  of  public  ownership  had  to  be  modified  somehow in order to accommodate market principles. The dilemma persists.

The most urgent task of the mid-1990s was restructuring the industrial state enterprise sector, especially the textiles, paper products, armaments, machinery, gas,  and  coal  industries,  and  the  process  is  still  ongoing.  These  dinosaurs  of central planning were losing billions of yuan each year. For decades their inputs, outputs, distribution, and product pricing had been determined not by dynamic market forces but by government decree. Local managers and workers had no input  into  decisions,  there  were  few  incentives  and  little  accountability  at  any level, and the government routinely extended loans to keep them going. After not being able to pay workers' wages and pensions for months, many declared bankruptcy, resulting in, by 1997, a frighteningly high level of unemployment - 14 million  in  the  cities  and  130  million  in  the  rural  areas  -  creating  not  only  an economic problem, but nationwide social instability and unrest. Indeed, after the announcement  of  the  massive  sale  of  state  owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  labour staged many demonstrations, and these have been accelerating.

Considerable research has been done in the 1980s and 1990s on the economic reforms as a whole, or those pertaining to a given sector, but there have been few case studies of individual industries. 1 A case study of the coal industry is of

## 4 Introduction

enormous importance to a better understanding not only of China's modernization and economic growth, but of its political economy. The industry has deep historical roots, is widely dispersed over the country, involves a multiplicity of levels  of  government,  interfaces  with  many  other  industries,  is  classified  as 'strategic', and has one of the largest labour forces. Not least of all, China has been cast in the international spotlight as a result of the link between its incomparable  consumption  of  coal  and  the  potentially  devastating  effects  of  global warming on the planet as a whole.

This book is an economic and sociopolitical history of China' s coal industry, tracing  its  development  since  the  mid-nineteenth  century  to  the  present,  with greatest emphasis on the reform era. The concurrent though far from synchronous development of the railways and thermal electric plants is also considered in some detail because they provide the critical links between coal producers and energy consumers. The study will be of interest not only to China specialists, but to students  of  comparative  and  development  economics,  energy  economics,  energy geography, reformation of centrally planned economies, the locational dynamics of industry, and the history of the coal industry generally. Production, financing, transportation, and consumption - the four components of coal industry economics  -  provide  the  framework  for  discussion.  International  comparisons  have been given wherever pertinent and possible. Based in large part on state publications, the Chinese press, reports, and studies by Chinese scholars, and the author' s own field work, the presentation is longitudinal with topical subdivision.

Chapter 1 is a summary, based almost entirely on the very thorough research of Wright and Ikonnikov, of the first century of development of the modern coal industry in China, beginning around 1840, and highlights the major involvement of foreign governments and commercial ventures in mine and railway development. 2 It establishes the level of progress at the time of the proclamation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949.

The first part of Chapter 2 explains why Soviet central planning was chosen, how the material balances system worked, and the specifics of the plans, formulated with Soviet assistance, for China' s coal industry. The material for this part came mainly from a wide variety of Chinese language journals and collection of articles. The second part gives the reasons why Mao Zedong believed it was necessary to modify Soviet central planning, and describes how the coal industry was transformed completely and disastrously by his Great Leap Forward campaign in the late 1950s and his second and equally damaging sociopolitical experiment, the Cultural Revolution, beginning in 1966 and lasting for ten years. Throughout his  active  tenure  a  debate  raged  between  him  and  his  supporters  on  the  one hand,  who  favoured  decentralized,  small-scale  industrial  development,  and  the 'pragmatists', including Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on the other, who argued at this time for centralized, large-scale industrial development. This debate, and others stemming from the radical differences in approaches to economic and social reform, were clearly played out in the government' s policies for the coal industry. The main sources of information here were the Zhongguo meitan gongye nianjian (China Coal Industry Y earbook), 3 Zhonghua renmin gongheguo

jingji da  shiji 1949-1980 (Major  Economic  Events  in  Communist  China 1949-1980), 4 and China's Socialist Economy - An Outline History  1949-1984 ( ). 5

Chapter 3 is an assessment of production, financing, transportation, and consumption in 1978, after Mao's death two years earlier, and on the eve of Deng Xiaoping's launching of the programme for reform and opening up. A variety of standard performance indicators is employed, and the weaknesses of central planning - both inherent but especially as applied to the Chinese coal industry - are discussed, as are the pivotal problems of inter-industry linkages.

The  total  growth  in  production  that  was  achieved  between  1949  and  1978 despite the collapse of the industry after the Great Leap Forward and major disruptions during the Cultural Revolution is astounding, especially considering the out-of-date, ill-adapted, and worn machinery used at the large state mines and the very little, if any, machinery available at the local mines. The cost to the country was astronomical in terms of the thousands of lives lost and the pollution caused by the burning of unparalleled amounts of mostly untreated coal.

In the early 1980s an avalanche of new newspapers, journals, and yearbooks began publication in China, or resumed after a hiatus of some fifteen to twenty years. 6 The government wanted the outside world to know as much as possible about China's economy in order to promote and facilitate foreign trade and investment. Chinese academics were encouraged to write and publish their ideas about how the reforms should be carried out. The volume and detail of the information, some of which is available in English, but mostly only in Chinese, and the exposure  of  the  hitherto  hidden  sharp  dissent  and  debate  over  government  policy presented foreign China scholars the unprecedented problem of vast amounts of information to digest and assess. Compared to the pre-reform years, the amount of material becoming available in the 1980s and 1990s was not only ever-increasing, but came from a wide variety of often disagreeing sources, making the writing of Chapters 4 to 7 more challenging.

The  energy  industry  was  a  core  component  of  the  Sixth  Five  Y ear  Plan (1981-85), the first under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping. Chapter 4 recounts how the coal industry was affected by Deng' s attacking the problems of too much centralized  control  and  the  pervasive  lack  of  motivation  and  responsibility  by separating  government from enterprise management, and introducing financial incentives and market forces. His determination to open up China was characterized by persistent pursuit of foreign capital and technology through such instruments as the China National Coal Import and Export Corporation created in 1982, to be responsible for trade, importing foreign technology, and the establishment of joint ventures.

Chapter 5 relates how the widening and deepening of the reforms over the next fifteen years - the Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Five Y ear Plans - combined to transform the coal industry. The 1989 Tiananmen Incident caused a relatively brief period of retrenchment and consolidation, which was followed in 1992 by Deng' s trip to South China where he was so impressed with the rapid modernization that he called upon the whole country to pursue reform and opening up more vigorously, and had the phrase 'socialist market economy' entrenched in the constitution to

replace 'central planning'. The coal industry would undergo major organizational changes, with individual administrations and enterprises having greater decisionmaking authority and responsibility for profit and loss. Coal enterprises would participate in labour contracts, profit retention schemes, price reforms, revenuesharing  systems,  new  measures  to  attract  investment,  the  sale  of  shares,  and listing on stock exchanges.

However, at the very time many of these reforms were being introduced the demand for coal began to decline, and in the late 1990s the government, for the first time ever, actually sought to curtail production, and to do so sharply. They also forced many enterprises, including coal, to declare bankruptcy, an unheard of measure hitherto.

The reduction in coal consumption was the result of a combination of a number of more or less equally important factors: the bankruptcy of thousands of state owned industrial  enterprises  meant  far  less  coal  was  required;  urban  residents were switching to gas for cooking and heating as soon as it became available; the demand for light industry products was surpassing that for heavy; many industries by this time, in the interests of efficiency, had installed modern coal-burning equipment or replaced coal entirely with oil or electricity in order to compete internationally; the alarm being expressed worldwide about the local and global effects of pollution caused by the burning of so much untreated coal could no longer be ignored; and two decades of buoyant trade and the securing of global export  market  niches,  particularly  in  electric  equipment  and  accessories  and textile  materials  and  products,  assured  continuing  sizable  reserves  of  foreign exchange with which to import large quantities of oil products.

In the late 1990s, economists were no longer surmising 'if', but 'when' coal consumption in China would fall from accounting for over 70 per cent of total energy consumption to the 20-30 per cent average in the rest of the world. At the time  of  writing  they  expected  that  coal  would  still  be  required  for  at  least  50 per cent of national energy requirements until 2020.

Chapter 6 is an assessment of the coal industry after twenty years of reform, using the same performance indicators employed in Chapter 3, and some additional ones. Over the 1980s and 1990s the structure of production changed dramatically, with the proportion of total production coming from the state mines decreasing from nearly 85 per cent in 1978 to a low of about 54 in 1995, while that from the small, local non-state mines increased from about 15 per cent to 46. Great strides had been made at the former in raising average technical standards including safety levels, as well as the quality of output. However, the high ratio of coal from the local non-state mines kept the average safety and quality statistics for the country as a whole still alarmingly low, internationally speaking. From approximately 1996 the demand for coal began to fall quickly and the government's two-pronged strategy since then has been to close thousands of the small mines  that  had  been  opened  in  the  1980s  and  to  begin  to  consolidate  total production at a greatly reduced number of large, modern operations. In 2000, the state:  non-state  ratio  of  production  stood  at  about  70 : 30  per  cent. Attainment country-wide  of  international  standards  for  production  methods,  quality  and safety would finally be a possibility.

The first  section  of  Chapter  7  summarizes  the  development  of  China' s  coal industry over some 150 years, while the second is a conjectural look towards the early decades of the new millennium. The issues to be resolved in the industry at the turn of the century, the expected development of other forms of energy, and some energy consumption structure scenarios up to 2050 put forward by several Chinese energy analysts are discussed.

This  much  is  certain:  China  has  abandoned  its  policy  of  energy  selfsufficiency. At the beginning of the reform period, the leadership reassessed the role of coal in the hopes of decreasing, if not replacing, its use, and concluded it was not feasible at that time. About sixteen years later, they began to compete eagerly  for  a  share  of  international  liquid  fossil  fuel  supplies  and  to  build  the necessary infrastructure for importing these. This testifies in some measure to both the success of the reform programme and the depth of integration into the global economy.

## The industry before 1949

## Development by foreign interests

Historical sources are more or less in agreement that coal was first used in various parts  of  the  world  during  the  Bronze  Age,  3,000-4,000  years  ago,  that  the Chinese began to use coal for heating and smelting in the Warring States Period (475-221  BCE),  and  that  they  are  credited  with  organizing  production  and consumption to the extent that by the year 1,000 this activity could be called an industry. China remained the world' s largest producer and consumer of coal until the perfecting and patenting of the steam engine by James Watt in 1769.

Europe's coal industry began in England and Belgium in the 1200s. Initially, coal was used almost exclusively for smelting and forging of metals. Wood and charcoal made from wood remained the main forms of fuel for residential heating as late as the 1600s when a switch to coal for most energy needs was necessitated by the exhaustion of accessible forests.

The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the 1700s and later spread to Europe, North America, and Japan, was based on the availability of coal, and human and animal powered industries were transformed in scale and scope with the  invention  of  the  steam  engine.  International  trade  expanded  exponentially when  these  coal-fed  engines  were  built  for  the  railways  and  ships,  but  this technology did not reach China until the mid- to late-1800s.

The demand for Chinese coal greatly increased when foreign steamships began to arrive following the opening of several treaty ports in the 1840s. Initially, coal for the return voyage was brought from the US or Britain, or wherever the home or last refuelling port happened to be, but this was, of course, impractical. At that time, China' s coal was very expensive due to the high transportation costs in combination with heavy government taxation - the mineral production tax, mining area tax, land tax, provincial transit dues, coast trade and maritime customs duties, and others. The poor quality of the coal from the native pits was also a drawback. Coal  bought  from  Japan  was  a  cheaper  alternative,  but  by  the  mid-1800s  the demand for coal by the Chinese navy, international shipping companies, and economic growth generally, was such that both Chinese and foreigners sought largerscale development of China's coal industry. 1

The  first  foreign  proposal  for  development  was  made  by  a  Briton,  John William  Howell,  in  1864,  and  construction  was  started  on  a  mine  at  Jilong

(Taiwan)  in  1874  which  was  to  supply  the  Fuzhou  shipyard  and  the  Chinese navy. 2 In  the  late  1800s  British,  German,  Belgian,  and  Russian  interests  built, invested  capital  and/or  operated  mines  in  Hebei,  Shanxi,  Shandong,  Liaoning, and Inner Mongolia. 3

The Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, the Sino-British Treaty of 1902, and the Sino-American  Treaty  of  1903, inter  alia ,  clarified  the  regulations  regarding foreign involvement in the mining sector and investors were quick to respond. Between 1895 and 1912 thirty-three coal mining agreements were signed with foreigners and many Chinese mines were taken over by foreign interests. 4 In 1898 mining rights ten miles on either side of the Jiaozhou-Jinan Railway in Shandong were given to the Germans, and similar rights were awarded to the Russians along the  Chinese  Eastern  Railway  in  Jilin  and  Heilongjiang.  In  the  same  year,  the Peking  Syndicate,  an Anglo-Italian  Corporation,  was  granted  mining  rights  in Shanxi and Henan. Concessions were also given to Great Britain at Tungkuanshan (Anhui), and to the Japanese at Fushun, Y antai, and Benxi (all in Liaoning).

However, the Chinese soon began to understand fully both the economic and strategic  value  of  their  coal  industry  and  in  1906  the  government  sought  to redeem some of these concessions. The regulations that were officially promulgated in 1908 stipulated that foreign capital in any enterprise was limited to 50 per cent of the total. The same policy was perpetuated in the mining regulations of 1914, and it was further specified that the general manager of any Sino-foreign company had to be Chinese. It was later ruled that foreigners could not invest in small  mines  unless  they  introduced  machinery. 5 Generally,  the  fifty : fifty arrangement  functioned  well  enough.  However,  many  foreigners  believed  that enterprises could never be profitable if managed predominantly by Chinese and found ways to disregard the regulation.

When the Qing Dynasty collapsed in 1911, the development and modernization of the coal industry were disrupted. However, the effects of the civil wars that took place in the 1920s were far worse. Only a few railway lines outside of Manchuria  continued  to  operate  at  full  capacity,  if  at  all.  During  this  period no  new  agreements  with  foreigners  were  signed,  and  most  of  those  who  had already been operating mines, apart from the Japanese who by now had established ascendancy, lost their rights.

## Production

## Quantity, geographical distribution, and quality

The Japanese involvement in the industry gained momentum after their defeat of the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and soon thereafter they were the most active foreign participants in China' s coal industry. The Fushun mine (Liaoning), which had been developed by the Russians before the turn of the century, was now taken over completely by the Japanese South Manchurian Railway Company. It had some of the world' s thickest seams, and of all the mines involving foreign interests was by far the largest. In fact it was one of only two

entirely foreign-controlled coal enterprises, the other being Y antai (Sino-Russian from 1899-1905, Japanese after the War), south of Mukden City (now Shenyang). The Fushun mine exported to southern China, Formosa (now Taiwan), Japan, and to the East Indies. 6

The mines operated by the Japanese, by 1926, accounted for almost all of the output from the foreign-connected mines, and of the output from the Japanese mines alone, never less than 65 per cent came from Fushun. Production was evidently highly concentrated. Indeed, the Kailuan Mining Administration accounted for never less than 70 per cent of production from the British-connected mines. 7 Many of the foreign companies enjoyed several advantages, for not only did they control some of the best coal seams and had the most advantageous locations in China  in  terms  of  transportation  and  markets,  they  had  diplomatic  protection against extra taxes and imposts levied by zealous local authorities and warlords demanding lump sums for military funds. 8

The Japanese occupied Manchuria in 1931 and set up a puppet state called Manchoukuo. The second Sino-Japanese War began in 1937. By 1942 the Japanese controlled all the major coal centres in the country, not only in Manchuria, but in the north, northeast, as well as the east, and central south, all together accounting for 90 per cent of all the coal produced. The British enterprises accounted for 7-9 per cent, the German 0.8-1.6 per cent, and the Russian 0.2-0.3 per cent. 9

Table 1.1 gives the percentages of total output from Chinese enterprises, joint Chinese-foreign enterprises, and foreign enterprises from 1913 to 1942. 10 Chinese enterprises accounted for over 50 per cent of the total output in 1919, while joint Chinese-foreign  and  foreign  together  made  up  the  remainder.  Of  the  joint Chinese-foreign enterprises, those with English interests had the largest outputs. The 'other' category included Russian, German, French, and Belgium interests. By  1936  the  Chinese  share  had  fallen  to  43  per  cent  and  in  1942,  almost  90 per cent of the production was in the hands of the Japanese.

The mines owned and operated solely by the Chinese were generally small pits. Most were worked only during the winter as harvesting diverted the labour force over the summer months, and because there was less flooding and better ventilation in the colder season. They lacked mechanized equipment and productivity was very low and accidents frequent. In all they contributed about one-sixth to onequarter of the total output. 11 In some cases, small and large mines worked together in harmony, the large mines buying coal from the small and organizing its sale. Often up to 10 per cent of the output sold by the large mines actually came from the surrounding pits. 12 In other situations, small mines competed with the larger ones, putting coal on the local market at comparable or lower prices, and although all  mines  were  supposed  to  have  a  licence  from  the  government,  many  of  the smaller operations were mining illegally on territory granted to large companies. 13

Table 1.2 gives the annual coal production in China between 1896 and 1949. In 1936 it accounted for 2.7 per cent of the world' s bituminous output, 5.6 per cent of its anthracite, and less than one-fifth of one per cent of its lignite. 14 The pre1949 coal production peak was 65.7 million tons in 1942, over one-third of this having been produced in areas occupied by the Japanese. 15 For perspective, the

## Ikonnikov's explanatory notes:

largest quantity the coal industry in the UK ever produced in one year was 287.4 million tons in 1913. 16

The production peak in Manchuria alone was in 1944, at 25.6 million tons. 17 During the war with the Japanese, between 1937 and 1945, despite shortages in the south, which was forced to import, northern coal was shipped to Japan for their  war  effort.  Output  in  1946  fell  dramatically,  but  recovered  in  1949. Nationalization  of  the  industry  began  immediately  after  evacuation  of  the Japanese  forces  in  1945.  Between  1945  and  1947,  government  capital  in  the industry rose from 12 to 29 per cent. 18

Between August 1945 and May 1946, the Soviets removed whatever industrial equipment they could find in Manchuria. What they could not take back to the

## 14 The industry before 1949

Soviet  Union  they  destroyed.  It  has  been  estimated  that  Soviet  looting  and destruction  reduced  the  plant  and  equipment  capacity  of  the  coal  industry  by some  80-90  per  cent  and  further  losses  throughout  the  rest  of  the  country occurred as a result of the civil war in 1947-48. 19 By 1949 there was little operable machinery in any industry. Y et the mine development that took place before 1949 had lasting significance. Six of the country' s largest mines in the 1990s, Fushun and Fuxin (Liaoning), Hegang and Jixi (Heilongjiang), Huainan (Anhui), and Kailuan (Hebei), were built in the early 1900s, largely with foreign capital. Other large mines constructed around that time were Benxi (Liaoning), Jingxing (Hebei),  Zhongxing  and  Luta  (both  in  Shandong),  Chiaotso  (Henan),  and Pingxiang (Jiangxi). For the sake of comparison, while China's total output in 1949 was 32.4 million tons, and ranked ninth in the world, it was 435.9 million tons in the US, 218.6 million tons in the UK, 176.1 in Germany, 74.1 in Poland, 52.9 in France, 37.9 in Japan, 32.0 in India, 27.9 in Belgium, 25.0 in South Africa, and 14.3 in Australia. 20

Table  1.3  shows  the  geographical  distribution  of  large  mine  production between 1912 and 1936. Production was concentrated in the north and northeast regions which together accounted for over 90 per cent of the country' s large mine output,  and  of  this,  two  provinces,  Liaoning  and  Hebei,  alone  accounted  for a minimum of 66 per cent (see Figure 1.1). Kailuan and Fushun mines almost consistently accounted for over half of the total large mine output and actually accounted for 71 per cent in 1927. 21 According to the management, Kailuan's

Zhaogezhuang,  with  a  capacity  of  some  two  million  tons,  was  the  largest underground colliery outside the US in the early 1920s. 22 The result of this concentration  in  the  north  and  northeast  was  that  the  country' s  overall  industrial development became increasingly imbalanced. Not surprisingly, most of the coal was  consumed  where  the  industrial  development  was  greatest,  namely, Manchuria, Shanghai, and the Treaty Ports. In 1936, 36.0 per cent was consumed in the north, 26.4 per cent in the northeast, 22.9 per cent in the centre and east, 7.9 in the southeast, 5.6 in the northwest, and 4.2 in the west and southwest. 23

In the early 1910s and early 1920s Manchuria produced over 30 per cent of China's coal even though it had under 2 per cent of China' s coal reserves and only about 7 per cent of its population. In 1925-26, when the civil wars disrupted production in the north, it accounted for over 50 per cent of the total coal production. Output from large mines in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe (a province in the pre-1949 period) grew at 10.9 per cent per year between 1907 and 1936, while in the rest of China the rate was 5.8 per cent. 24 Compared to growth in China proper,  the  coal  industry' s  expansion  in  Manchuria  was  rapid. The  area enjoyed relative political stability, GNP was higher, and per capita consumption of coal was twice as high. Japan' s intention was that Manchuria serve not just as a raw materials hinterland, but also as a new industrial and population base.

## 16 The industry before 1949

In the 1930s Shanxi, China's most coal-rich province and one of the largest deposits in the world, was producing less than 4 per cent of total output. Reasons that have been given for this include: shortage of water for steam engines and timber for pit props; shortage of capital, which not only limited growth potential but resulted in horrific working conditions; and the high cost of transportation to coastal markets. 25 Moreover, before 1937 the area was continually plagued with political  and  military  upheavals  which  disrupted  railway  traffic.  The  Peking Syndicate  did  plan  to  develop  the  resources,  but  was  unsuccessful  in  gaining permission  to  build  a  railway  to  Pukou  (Jiangsu),  where  the  coal  would  have been unloaded onto ships and transported on the Changjiang. 26

The  ratio  between  production  in  Manchuria  and  China  proper  in  1942  was 63:37. In 1947 it was 75 : 25, but by the time of the Communist takeover in 1949 it  was  down  to  60 : 40. 27 In  order  to  reduce  the  demand  on  northern  coal,  the Nationalist government had opened the Huainan mine (Anhui) in 1929 and by 1936 it was supplying much of Shanghai's needs. The southwest region, held by the Nationalists and sometimes referred to as 'Free China', was developed after 1937, when the wars disrupted the supplies in the north.

Washing coal removes various impurities such as shale, clay, pyrites, etc., and may  involve  either  physical  separation,  which  mechanically  distinguishes  the relative gravities and/or surface properties of the coal, or magnetic or chemical separation. Often after the coal is washed, it is processed, which entails the crushing of the large lumps, and screening them into various standard sizes. Up to twothirds more raw than clean coal is required to achieve the necessary heat levels, and up to one-third more space is occupied in transit and storage.

A good quality washed coal has about 7,000 kcal per kg. The average caloric value before washing at the best mines was about 6,600 kcal, but from the least good may have been as low as 3,500. 28 Before 1949 little attention was given to improving the quality of the coal. Generally, it was simply used in its raw form without being washed, though some was sized.

## Mechanization and use of labour

Apart from opencast mines at the Guchengzi site at Fushun (Liaoning) and at Zhalainuoer  and  Hegang  (Heilongjiang),  almost  all  the  mines  before  the Sino-Japanese War (1937-45) were underground and used the room and pillar system. 29 The longwall system was not implemented until the 1950s. 30 Compared to European mines, which had been built much earlier, the mines in China were relatively shallow. The average depth in the deepest shafts at China' s largest mines was 163m, comparable to that in the US. 31

The level of technology used for cutting the coal was rudimentary. While the proportion of coal cut by mechanized means was less than 1 per cent at the time the PRC was established, 55 per cent of the coal was cut by mechanized means in the UK in 1936, 97 per cent in Germany's Ruhr Valley, 99 per cent in Belgium, and 88 per cent in France' s Pas-de-Calais mines in 1935. 32 The main reason for the lack of mechanized operations in China was the abundant and cheap labour

available to the contractors. Other factors were the shallowness of the mines, and the fear on the part of foreign developers that the prevalent political turmoil could at any time disrupt mining or coal transport. It was simply not in the interests of the foreigners to bring the best and most expensive equipment available. As the mines became deeper, however, not only was extraction more dangerous, but the miners needed training. This was not easy to provide to the illiterate gangs of men from the farms who worked only for a few years at the mines, and for only part of the year at that.

The hauling of the coal to the surface was generally the first mining process to be mechanized, and at the Japanese-operated mines in particular, it was relatively sophisticated. While over 50,000 pit ponies were in use in British mines in the late 1930s, the Japanese-operated mines had switched to electrically powered ropes or locomotives. 33

Most mines had contractors to oversee the coal cutting and hauling. They were charged with supervising crews of men to bring to the surface, by a certain target date,  an  agreed  amount  of  coal.  Often  bonuses  were  given  if  the  amount  was exceeded.  Under  this  contract  system,  the  contractor  hired  the  men,  mainly peasants from rural areas, and provided them lodging, meals, and pay. For the mine owners, this system was very convenient, but for the gangs of men it was abusive. The living and working conditions were primitive and the pay paltry. The contractors tended to cut corners wherever possible and to request extra fees for the smallest of services to both the workers and the mine owners. Initially, the workers had no rights (apart from a free coffin!) or recourse whatsoever, though as time went on it was necessary to improve the conditions and terms in order to reduce the high turnover of men. 34 A minimum wage was eventually instituted and the responsibility of paying the workers was taken out of the hands of the contractors and assumed by the mine owners.

Most of the labourers were male rural peasants who returned to their fields during the planting and harvest seasons. Though often ignored, there was a law prohibiting the hiring of workers under the age of sixteen. A few women hauled coal to the surface, while many worked at the surface level. Unlike the mines in Japan, where convicts made up a large proportion of the miners, it seems in China convict labour was used only in Sichuan Province. 35 There was some use of slaves and instances of kidnapped workers. Others were tricked into amassing gambling or drinking debts and then forced to sell their labour. Some signed up on the basis of feigned promises.

While unskilled labour was rarely in short supply, an insufficiency of skilled labour characterized the industry until the 1920s. Mining companies were forced to  seek  out  foreign  engineers  and  technical  staff. This  raised  production  costs considerably. When the Japanese took over all the Chinese-owned mines in the northeast, they brought their own engineers.

The average output per manshift at the largest mines in the 1930s and 1940s was 0.592 tons. 36 By contrast, in 1937 it was 1.534 tons in the UK, 2.002 in West Germany, 1.435 in the Saar, 1.236 in France, 2.413 in Poland, 1.139 in Belgium, 2.550 in the Netherlands, and 1.837 in Czechoslovakia. 37

## 18 The industry before 1949

The accident rate was very high. While there were between 5 and 21 fatalities per million tons of output at the American, Indian, and Japanese mines in the late 1800s and early 1900s, there were between 25 and 212 at the main mines in China between 1907 and 1934. 38 The difference would be very much greater if the small Chinese-run mines were included. A gas explosion at Benxi (Liaoning) in 1942 killed 1,662. This was the biggest ever coal mine accident in world history to date. The rate of lung and skin disease was also very high, and the average working life of the miners was but a decade.

Wages, though barely enough to survive on, were not the lowest in the industrial category. The  mainly  women  workers  in  the  cotton  spinning,  silk  reeling,  and match industries were paid less. Relatively speaking, though, working conditions in these industries were somewhat better. Unlike in other countries, the Chinese mine workers were not highly organized. There were several altercations - mainly protests against the barbaric treatment accorded them by the contractors - but until the 1920s the workers were insufficiently integrated to form unions. There were a number of reasons for this. The mines were spread over a large geographical area, the men were not at the mines all year round, and due to the wretched working conditions and exploitative contract system the worker turnover rate was high. They were  illiterate  and  completely  uninformed  about  alternative  industrial  management structures, far less the militancy in other countries' coal mining industries.

Mention must be made, however, of an escalation in organized labour protests in  the  1920s,  especially  among  miners  at  the  larger  operations.  Marxist  Study Groups, the Chinese Labour Organization Secretariat, and after its formation in 1921, the Chinese Communist Party had been organizing labour in those areas where it was concentrated. Miners staged strikes at Pingxiang (Jiangxi), Kailuan (Hebei),  Tangshan  (Hebei),  Zhaogezhuang  (Hebei),  Linxi  (Hebei),  Majiagou (Shanxi), and several other sites. The issue was usually low or non-payment of wages, maltreatment of workers, or some aspect of working conditions or terms. This heightened agitation of the miners lasted throughout the decade.

This localized and short-lived intensification of labour unrest apart, the figures for mine worker unionization were never large when considered over the whole pre-1949 period. In China proper never more than 40 per cent of the workers were unionized. This was half the rate of unionization at the American mines in the same period. If the work force in the large mines in Manchuria were factored in, the percentage would be reduced to 20 per cent, while inclusion of the workers at the  native  pits  would  further  reduce  it  to  less  than  10. 39 In  the  1940s  the  key strategic industries such as the railroads and communications were nationalized for defence reasons and in 1942 a draft labour policy forbade 'workers in military industries' (all heavy industries including coal) to strike or participate in collective bargaining. 40

## Financing

The big mines either made direct sales to retailers or consumers at the ports or at stops along railway lines, or sold it through distributing companies or agents who

earned commissions. It was the responsibility of the mines to organize the transport and handling of the coal, while the agent managed storage and sales. The coal that was not sold directly to consumers often went through several middlemen, who in turn raised the price higher and higher.

Managers of all urban coal distribution centres with capital amounting to over a certain level belonged to 'coal guilds'. The Peiping Coal Guild was registered with  the  Peiping  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  its  members  met  monthly. 41 In Manchuria,  distribution  was  managed  by  the  Japan-Manchukuo  Trading Corporation, while marketing came under the jurisdiction of the main railway, metallurgical, and other heavy industry companies.

The blockage of railway traffic during the civil wars in the late 1920s nearly forced the closure of some mines in the interior, but mines with foreign connections such as Kailuan and Fushun were spared and continued to make high profits. In the 1930s, the depression affected Manchuria first, and China proper later.

Coal occupied a very important role in the economy. Compared to consumer goods or other mining products its percentage contribution to total industrial net value-added  was  fairly  consistent  (see Table  1.4).  It  accounted  for  about  onequarter to one-third of the total between 1912 and 1945, dropped sharply to about one-sixth in 1946, but came back up to about one-quarter in 1949.

## Chang's note:

Consumer goods: cotton yarn and cotton cloth; ferrous metals: iron ore, pig iron, and steel;  other  mining  products:  antimony,  copper,  gold,  mercury,  tin,  and  tungsten. Cement and crude oil, accounting for only negligible fractions of the total, have been omitted; the percentages, therefore, do not add up to 100.

Coal exports and imports between 1864 and 1948 are given in Table 1.2. Before 1915, imports were greater than exports. During the early 1800s coal had been brought from Japan, India, America, Britain, and Australia. Between 1917 and 1943 the situation was reversed. The volume of exports depended largely on the supply situation in Japan, and concomitantly, the relative prices of Chinese and Japanese coal. Exports as a proportion of total national coal output were as high as 14-16 per cent in some years, though as southern China imported some coal from Vietnam (mainly anthracite), India, the Netherlands, East Indies, and Japan, the adjusted net export figures were somewhat less. 42

Most but not all of the export shipments came from Japanese-operated mines and most - up to one-third of their production - were destined for Japan. Some shipments were also sent to Hong Kong and Korea. In 1936 exports from China proper amounted to 7 per cent of total production and 1.5 per cent of total export trade. Imports amounted to 3 per cent of domestic consumption and 0.7 per cent of  total  import  trade. 43 For  perspective,  4.92  million  tons  were  exported  from China in 1936, compared to 51.2 million tons from the UK in 1935. 44

The  demand  for  extra  coal  supplies  from  China  rose  sharply  in  the  years leading up to the Second World War. Ironically, it was Chinese coal which fuelled the  Japanese  war  in  Southeast Asia,  including  China.  One  of  the  first  acts  of the invading Japanese soldiers was to commandeer all the largest mines. 45 Of particular interest was the coking coal, used in the manufacture of steel, at Kailuan. Its  output  was  shipped  north  to  Manchuria  and  to  Japan.  In  1944  the  Kailuan mines were incapacitated by bombs, forcing China proper to import coal from Indo-China.

## Transport

As in the majority of other countries, the most efficient way to move coal from the  mines  to  points  of  consumption  in  China  was  the  railways.  There  was a  symbiotic  relationship  between  the  coal  industry  and  the  railways  -  neither could survive without the other. The cost of railway transport was as low as less than a fifth of that for the other forms of land transport, and, in any case, humans or pack animals were capable of pulling or carrying this heavy bulky commodity only  limited  distances. 46 Wright  calculates  that  for  cart  transport  of  coal,  the approximate  economic  radius  in  1913  was  75 km,  and  for  railways  well  over 500km. 47 The development and modernization of railway transport made it feasible for foreign mining companies to operate profitably, and immediately created in the cities an insatiable demand for coal from manufacturing and commercial enterprises. Factories grew in such number and scope that imports of manufactured items dropped sharply. The development of railways also made domestic coal competitive with coal imports, which came to be used only in emergencies.

A proposal for a railway line from Shanghai to Suzhou had been made in 1863 by a group of British businessmen. The Chinese government, however, fearful that this technology would make the Chinese vulnerable to foreign economic and political dominance, refused permission. It was not until 1876 that a ten-mile line

was actually built - by a Briton, Gabriel James Morrison - connecting Shanghai with Wusung. 48 However, the authorities tore it up the following year and shipped it to Taiwan, never to be reassembled. The second line was begun in 1878 by an English engineer, Claude Kinder, from the Kaiping mines to Xugezhuang (Hebei), which is situated on a canal. It was later extended to Tianjin and then Peking, Mukden,  now  called  Shenyang  (Liaoning),  and  Hankou,  now  part  of  Wuhan (Hubei) becoming a major trunk line. 49

France, in 1885, was the first to obtain a railway concession which bordered Indo-China.  Russia  was  given  rights  the  following  year  in  Manchuria,  which permitted  the  construction  of  the  Chinese  Eastern  Railway  and  the  South Manchurian Railway. The Germans, British, and Japanese were also granted railway concessions for both trunk and feeder lines and 9,300 km had been built by the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 (see Table 1.5). Though the differences in gauge were problematic, taken together these lines became a vital network and coal was a main cargo.

Only another 11,442 km were laid before the end of the Republican period, 40 per cent of which were in Manchuria. The First World War, the civil wars, and the  Japanese  invasion  of  Manchuria,  and  the  Second  World  War  all  severely affected  railway  construction,  the  military  and/or  warlords  expropriating  all the rolling stock. Whereas India in 1936 had about 72,000 km of railway trackage and  33.5  billion  ton-km  of  freight,  China  had  only  20,742  and  14.6  billion, respectively. 50 The  Nationalists  constructed  several  railways  in  the  southwest during the  1940s.  By  1949  the  per  capita  national  trackage  was  still  very  low compared to that in other countries.

In the 1930s coal shipments occupied about half of the country' s railway capacity and on average accounted for 17 per cent of the railway revenues. On some lines they accounted for much more of the revenues, for example, about 31 per cent on the Kiaochow-Jinan (Shandong) line, 33 per cent on the Peking-Mukden line, 41 per cent on the Chengting-Taiyuan (Shanxi) line, and 68 per cent on the TaokowChinghua line. 51 The trackage and rolling stock were not only inadequate relative to production rates, but there was a lack of coordination between the mining and railway  sectors.  Railway  capacity  often  determined  coal  production. 52 Coal  was also shipped by water, southwards along the coast, and on the lower Changjiang and Wei River, and on various small rivers throughout the southwest. There were some 40,000 miles of canals at that time including the Grand Canal. 53 Total shipments on the Changjiang and along the coast were about one-quarter those on the railways and were for the most part overseen by the foreign-controlled mines. 54

## Consumption

Total coal consumption figures for 1912 to 1942 are given in Table 1.2. The highest figure here is 59.3 million tons in 1942. For perspective, total coal consumption in the UK in 1925 was 176.0 million tons. 55 Before the introduction of railways in China, coal use was necessarily restricted to a small radius around the mines. The demand for coal to fuel ships rose sharply with the opening of the Treaty Ports, beginning in 1840, which hastened both mining and railway development. Total potential demand was about 300,000 tons per annum in the early 1870s and rose to some 2 million tons in the early 1900s. 56 The demand for bunker coal slowed  later  due  to  a  downturn  in  world  trade,  more  efficient  use  of  coal  by the steamships, and the beginning of their conversion to the use of fuel oil. About 7 per cent of the coal from the large mines was sold to shipping companies in the mid-1930s. 57

When fuel oil was replacing bunker coal, the new railways became a major consumer of coal and some railway owners invested directly in mines to guarantee  their  supplies. Among  these  were  the  South  Manchurian  Railway,  Chinese Eastern Railway, and the Jing-Han line, connecting Peking and Hankou (Hubei). Several railway companies actually built their own mines.

Table 1.6 gives a breakdown of coal consumption in China from 1915 to 1933. For contrast, the corresponding breakdown in 1929 in the UK was: gas works 10 per cent, electricity generation 6 per cent, railways 7 per cent, coastal shipping

## Wright's note:

These figures are only intended to give an approximate indication of the magnitudes involved. The first line in particular is subject to a wide margin of error. That category could alternately be estimated as residual, thus eliminating the discrepancy between the use and supply of coal. This discrepancy could also be the result of  changes  in  stocks,  or  of  incorrect  estimation  of  small  mine  output  by  the Geological Survey of China.

1 per cent, iron works (using blast furnaces) 8 per cent, other iron works and steel works 5 per cent, collieries 8 per cent, and general manufactures and all other purposes  including  domestic  use  55  per  cent. 58 In  China,  the  transport  sector, comprising both the railways and steamships, was the largest consumer of coal up to the 1930s. Purchases of coal by railway companies sustained many mines, and the main business of some railways was shipping coal. From the mid-1910s the proportion  of  output  from  the  large  mines  used  by  the  railways  was  steady  at about 10 per cent. 59 The advent of cheaper transportation of coal led to an immediate rise in industrial activity in the urban areas.

The urban commercial and household sector accounted for 12 to 13 per cent of total coal consumption between 1915 and 1933. Per capita consumption was very low, only 0.07 tons in 1936 versus 3.9 tons in Great Britain, 3.5 tons in the US, 0.8 in the USSR, 0.6 in Japan, 0.2 in Spain, and 0.1 in India. 60 Coal was used in the large cities only. Residents in towns and medium-sized cities relied on straw and firewood. 61

The first industry to require large quantities of coal in the mid- to late-1800s was the manufacture of armaments. Later, coal was used to fuel and provide heat for light industries such as cotton, silk, salt, sugar, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, paper, ceramics, glass, and oil-pressing. Most of these industries were located in

China  proper. The  demand  from  heavy  industries  such  as  lime,  brick-making, sulphur, antimony, cement, and the metallurgical industries was much higher and predominantly from Manchuria.

Use of coal to generate electricity quickly increased from about 1910 onwards. At the time of the establishment of the PRC, about 10 per cent of total coal production was devoted to power generation. 62 In all there were 1.85 gigawatts (GW) of  installed  electric  capacity,  of  which  1.69 GW  (91.4  per  cent)  was  thermal and 0.16 GW (8.6 per cent) was hydro. Total electricity generation amounted to 4.3 billion kilowatt hours (kWh), of which 83.7 per cent came from thermal plants and 16.3 per cent came from hydro. Total electricity production peaked in 1943 at 59.5 billion kWh. For comparison total installed capacity in India in 1947 was about 1.36 GW and generation was 4.1 billion kWh. 63

The first thermal plant was built in 1882 by an American company and the first hydro  plant  in  1912.  Up  until  the  war  with  Japan  most  of  the  generation  and transmission  equipment  that  was  installed  had  been  brought  from  the  UK, Germany, France, the US, and Japan. Thermal plants produced almost all of the electricity until the Japanese began to build a few large hydro plants in the northeast. China proper had 460 thermal plants with a generating capacity of 542,000 kilowatts (kW) and an energy output of 1,694 million kWh in 1934. During the Second World War these were either taken over by the Japanese or destroyed, while in Manchuria, at the end of the war, many plants which had been built by the Japanese were stripped of their equipment by the Soviet armies.

The efficiency of the thermal plants was not high in 1949. By international standards the generators were very small and little of the equipment was operating at full capacity. The average efficiency for the country was 18 per cent, and the utilization rate was also low - over a third of all the power produced was consumed  by  the  plants  themselves. 64 In  1949  there  were  a  total  of  6,475 km  of transmission lines over 35 kilovolt (kV), of which 70.1 per cent were 35-66 kV , 5.3  per  cent  were  110 kV ,  12.8  per  cent  were  154 kV ,  and  11.8  per  cent  were 220kV . 65 Losses on the lines were very high at 25 per cent. 66

Electricity consumption per capita was a mere 7 kWh in 1947, compared to 291 in the Soviet Union, 2,130 in the US, 888 in Britain, 642 in France, and 418 in Japan. 67 Many industries operated their own power plants. The percentage split between civilian and industrial use in 1949 expressed as a ratio was 35 : 65. Of the latter, the railways accounted for 2.7 per cent, metal processing 3.5 per cent, and chemical processing 5.4 per cent. 68

## The pre-1949 legacy

On the eve of the Communist takeover in late 1949 the coal industry, as virtually all industries and the railways, was semi-paralysed from bombings and lootings. Though much reconstruction and re-equipping would be required, a relatively rapid restoration of what had been a profitable coal industry would be possible however.

Six of the country' s largest mines in the 1990s had been built in the early 1900s and at least a dozen other large mines date from the years of foreign development.

As  a  percentage  of  total  industrial  net  value-added,  the  coal  industry  had accounted  for  one-quarter  to  one-third  between  1912  and  1945.  China  ranked ninth in the world as a producer of coal in 1949, and the annual growth rate before 1937 had compared well with that of other countries.

Abundant cheap labour had kept mechanization at a low level, the work force was largely unskilled, and the quality of most of the coal was poor due to a lack of washing and sorting. As in most countries the location of coal deposits very much affected the development of the railways. Several railway lines built before 1911 became main transport arteries.

The  most  serious  problem  of  the  industry  on  the  eve  of  the  Communist takeover  was  the  lack  of  a  national  plan.  The  disparate  foreign  interests  had wanted quick and large returns on their investments and took a short-term view of development, thereby contributing to regional industrial imbalance.

## 2 Mao's adaptation of Soviet central planning

Effects on the industry

## Soviet central planning applied to the Chinese coal industry

The People' s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  was  proclaimed  on  1  October  1949. The Communist government inherited an economy in which the industrial sector had been  decimated  by  wars.  Inflation  was  rampant,  there  was  a  large  budgetary deficit, transportation and communication channels had been disrupted for years, and  there  was  high  unemployment  -  the  unemployment  rate  for  males  in non-agricultural  areas  was  possibly  as  high  as  32  per  cent. 1 The  largely  rural population - nearly 90 per cent - was illiterate and unskilled.

The government's key priority was immediate restoration of the economy, to be followed by rapid growth. Bitterness over the country' s history of exploitation by foreign capitalists spurred on achievement of the goal of making China a world power and capable of militarily defending itself. A United Nations embargo on strategic goods had been placed on China in 1950 and, as a result, there was little option but to seek assistance from the Soviet Union. 2 The Soviets were nearby and  willing  to  offer  technical  expertise,  equipment,  and  even  whole  industrial plants. The Chinese adopted, almost in total, the Soviet system of central or command planning. It was believed that given the country' s stage of development and the problems left by the Nationalist Government and the ravages of the years of war, the economy could best be brought under control and regional disparities diminished  by  unification  under  a  highly  centralized  form  of  government.  It seemed that  Soviet  central  planning  was  the  most  appropriate,  if  not  the  only available method of simultaneously guaranteeing the population a basic level of subsistence and achieving a high rate of capital formation. The material balances system provided the framework of Soviet central planning.

## The material balances system

In the Soviet economic planning system production was organized hierarchically, with  targets  set  by  the  central  authorities.  The  total  plan  was  in  the  form  of a  matrix  in  which  the  supply  of  and  demand  for  raw  materials,  intermediate goods, and finished goods all had to balance exactly. Included in the matrix were goods flowing through the international trade sector and those held in inventories.

Enterprises  did  not  themselves  arrange  for  their  supplies  of  inputs.  Planners calculated how for every state enterprise these were derived, and how and when they were to be distributed. If either the plan or its execution were faulty, cumulative dislocation occurred. For example, if one coal producer failed to reach its output target, or if the coal was delivered late or was of the wrong type, this would in turn affect the designated users in their attempts to attain their output targets.

In the final quarter of each year, the State Planning Commission (SPC) prepared preliminary balances for all commodities and capital goods currently under state control. These goods were referred to as being 'under unified distribution' or simply 'under plan', and plans were based on a combination of recent production figures and forecasts of potential output based on capital productive capacity  and  labour  inputs.  Each  ministry  was  given  proposed  output  targets  which were communicated to all the various sub-units. These were expected to calculate the quantities of all the inputs they required to fulfil their production targets. This information  was  then  passed  back  up  through  the  ministerial  hierarchy  to  the SPC, which considered all of these reports and constructed a balance sheet for each of the commodities under plan.

Considerable  adjustments  had  to  be  made  to  the  output  and  consumption targets for each commodity before the balances could be closed, that is, before the total allocations of any commodity precisely equalled the total supply of that particular commodity. The result was a matrix which had demand for each commodity along one axis and the supply on the other. When all of the individual commodity balances were completed, they served as the basis for the annual and five-year plans which were presented to the State Council for approval. Compared to the Soviet Union, China had relatively few commodities under unified distribution.  In  the  1970s  there  were  some  60,000  such  commodities  in  the  Soviet Union,  whereas  in  China  there  were  only  28  items  under  state  distribution  in 1952, 96 in 1953, 235 in 1956, 417 in 1958, 432 in 1960, 579 in 1965, 217 in 1971, 226 in 1972, and 210 in 1978. 3

Balance tables were also drawn up to schedule the mode and route of transportation  for  every  commodity  under  plan.  The  transportation  volumes  were determined only for the bulk commodities under plan, that is, coal, charcoal, mineral ores, iron and steel, timber, etc. The thousands of other commodities were not included in the national and regional balances tables. Of all the railway cargoes, the shipment of coal took precedence.

## Production

The ministry responsible for the coal industry was variously designated as the Ministry  of  Fuel  Industry  (1949-55),  Ministry  of  Coal  Industry  (1955-70), Ministry  of  Fuel  and  Chemical  Industry  (1970-75),  and  again  as  Ministry  of Coal Industry from 1975-88 when there was a major ministerial restructuring (see Chapter 5).

China's coal mines were divided into three main categories, the Central Mining Administrations  (CMAs),  the  local  state  (LS)  mines,  and  the  local  non-state

(LNS)  mines. 4 The  CMAs  were  those  which  were  controlled  by  the  central government and most of their production was allocated under plan. The LS mines were  operated  either  by  provincial,  prefectural,  or  county  governments,  while LNS mines were operated by townships, communes, collectives, or the People's Liberation Army. The output from the LS mines was also generally under unified distribution, while that from the LNS mines was not.

Figure  2.1  depicts  the  planning  hierarchy  of  the  Chinese  coal  industry and Figures 2.2 and 2.3 show the planning structures of CMAs and LS mines, respectively. In the coal industry long-term plans were set every five years in conjunction with the five-year national development plans and provided only general policy statements and, usually, output target ranges rather than specific targets. It was the highly detailed yearly plans which guided each department in the ministry responsible for coal towards the ultimate fulfilment of the long-term targets. The yearly plan had two parts, production and capital construction. The first of these had four major sections: output, personnel, material supply, and financing.

The production component was the basis upon which all of the other projections were formulated. Depending on the workable coal reserves available, and the amount and type of prepared capacity, the output section specified the rate and amount of production for each type of coal for the year at all mines under the Ministry' s control. It was further subdivided into quarterly, monthly, ten-day, day,

and  even  shift  plans,  and  also  stipulated  what  machinery  was  to  be  used  at each site, from where it was to be obtained, and how it was to be maintained.

There were six categories of personnel: workers, apprentices, engineers  and  technicians,  administrative  personnel,  service  personnel,  and  others. The first four categories were further broken down into drilling and tunnelling

workers, face workers, surface workers, machine repair men, geologists, surveyors, and designers. For each type of worker there were eight ranks based on experience, responsibility, and technical expertise. The men worked in brigades. For some tasks the men were paid individually, while for others, the brigade was paid on the basis of the work it did collectively. Theoretically, extra wages were given for above-quota production, experience, and the less desirable work, for example, underground work, construction work, and night shifts. Productivity norms, the proportion of individual and collective time-rate and piece-rate wages, bonuses, allowance structures, and welfare benefits were outlined.

The  material  balances  system  was  used  to  determine  the  allocation  of  all the inputs required by the Ministry. After it had been informed of its quotas of materials - steel, iron, timber, etc. - for the year, it would in turn distribute these to  the  sub-units  of  the  bureaux  according  to  their  planned  consumption.  The material supply section also gave consumption norms for each item and norms for maintaining reserves of materials.

The remainder of the production component was devoted to training, research into  new  production  and/or  management  techniques,  and  to  projects  handled independently by the mines, such as residential, commercial or cultural buildings, schools, medical facilities, etc.

Initially  there  was  no  government  department  or  agency  responsible  for  the LNS mines. When the Communist government came to power most of the small pits were closed or combined to make larger mines. All remaining ones were put under Party control. A special office was established to coordinate coal production for the Great Leap Forward (GLF), but this was disbanded soon after. In the years that followed, when coal supplies were especially tight, encouragement in the  form  of  grants  was  given  for  the  development  of  small  mines.  However, throughout  most  of  the  1960s  and  1970s  there  was  no  governing  body  which monitored the opening, operation, and output of the non-state mines.

## Financing

## Capital construction investment

The capital construction investment component was divided into productive and non-productive. Productive investment included funds for the prospecting, surveying, design, and construction of new mine capacity and expansion of existing capacity; construction of coal treatment plants, railway lines from the mines to stations, and machinery plants; funds for research and the operation of training colleges. Non-productive investment included the construction of buildings for the  miners  and  their  families,  such  as  housing,  clinics  and  hospitals,  schools, sport, and cultural amenities.

A  year-end  target  for  total  capacity  specified  where  and  how  it  should  be achieved, by new mine construction or renovation or expansion of existing mines. Prospecting, surveying, and designing teams were assigned for each project. The amount of new capacity created each year was directly related to the investment

funds allocated to the Ministry from the state budget, that is, 'above-norm' projects. 5 This  component also dealt  with  investment  in  coal  washing  plants,  machinery plants, and railway branch lines.

## The setting of prices

In centrally planned economies prices had three distinct functions. 6 The first was control and evaluation. Prices were used as accounting devices in the tabulation of the annual and five-year plans. The inputs and outputs of each enterprise, as well as targets for sales, profits, taxes, etc., were calculated by the central planners and expressed in value terms, and enterprise managers were evaluated on the basis of their fulfilment of these targets. Second, prices were used for allocation purposes and were integral to the process of drawing up national product, intersectoral accounts, and capital-output ratios. Value calculations were also used in deciding the relative merits of investment, modernization, or innovation projects. The third function was income distribution. Wages, transfer payments, and income taxes determined the distribution of income.

Prices could generally be classified as being 'cost-plus non-scarcity prices', meaning they were based on average production costs, and may have included a turnover tax or subsidy and a wholesale and/or retail trade profit margin. 7 Prices in  Soviet  style  command  economies  were  set  with  the  assumption  that  supply would dictate demand. Very low prices, often lower than the production costs, were attached to basic consumer goods in order to ensure their affordability for all.  Due  to  perpetual  shortages  and  rationing,  most  industries  were  not  'price takers' but 'quantity takers', that is, hoarding when supplies were available. Thus, there was no clear and consistent relationship between prices and demand. It was believed that in the interests of economic stability, that is, to help prevent inflation, domestic prices should not be influenced by world market conditions; therefore the monetary 'value' attached to each commodity bore little relation to the international price.

When  the  Communist  government  took  power  in  1949,  in  the  interests  of stabilizing the economy, no major changes were made to the price of coal from the recently nationalized state mines. The government' s key reason for maintaining the status quo was the fear of inflation. 8 During the war years the country had suffered hyper-inflation, and the new government did not want to take the chance of having prices go out of control again. As coal was a basic raw material for most industry,  especially  for  heavy  industry,  which  was  the  focus  of  the  country' s development programme at that time, the effects of a too  rapid  price  increase could reverberate throughout the economy. Furthermore, a substantial increase could potentially cause many of the large coal-consuming enterprises to default.

Since the early 1950s the Chinese conformed to the Soviet planning doctrine of shengchan ziliao bu shi chanpin , 9 that is, materials needed for production were a constituent part of production and were therefore not to be sold with the aim of making profits. 10 According to Marxist theory, raw materials should be priced as low as possible because they themselves are not responsible for accumulation.

The 'producer' or 'supply' price of coal in each of the provinces was strictly a  function  of  production  costs  plus  the  cost  of  taking  it  to  the  railway  station and loading it onto the cars, but did not include the cost of shipping it to its final destination.  The  'retail' prices  that  the  consumers  actually  paid  were  therefore higher  and  varied  greatly  around  the  country  because  they  included  the  transportation costs. The Soviet system for setting shipping prices was very rudimentary. There was essentially a flat ton-km rate and fixed terminal charges which reflected neither differences in handling costs nor the relative differences in terrain.

China's coal prices did not include any depletion or rent component whatsoever,  whereas  in  most  market  economies  the  price  for  any  non-renewable  fuel includes  a  scarcity  factor,  that  is,  a  depletion  component.  Though  there  was a price differential between washed and unwashed coal, there was no variation between different qualities of coal, that is, ash, moisture, sulphur content, etc., were not taken into consideration. 11

What are  referred  to  here  as  production  costs  are  average  annual  operating costs per ton incurred by the state underground mines operating at peak levels, and  exclude  any  investment  costs  sustained  in  the  preliminary  stages  of  mine development, for example, geological surveying and mine planning. In terms of Chinese accounting conventions, the largest component of total production costs in 1957 was wages at 36.8 per cent, followed by materials at 32.8, fuel at 0.7, depreciation at 6.1, electricity at 12.6, and other at 11.0. 12 For the sake of comparison, in the West labour costs in underground mines typically accounted for at least half of total operating costs.

## Socialism with Chinese characteristics: Mao's frustration with central planning

Though he retained the basic tenets of socialism, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party, shunned Soviet central planning as early as 1956. He sought to create a special brand of socialism, 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', that would, he thought, more closely meet China' s particular needs. To this end he carried out experiments which he hoped would lead concurrently to economic growth and the levelling of class barriers. He did this by launching a series of campaigns.

Between 1958 and 1978 the entire Chinese economy, not least of all the coal industry  and  the  railways,  was  dramatically  affected,  especially  by  the  'Great Leap Forward' and the 'Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution'. Industrial policies reflected the power struggle between Mao, who favoured small-scale decentralized development, and the 'pragmatist' leaders who favoured large-scale centralized development.  Superimposed  on  this  antagonism  were  strategic  considerations, which, until the early 1970s had a major impact on the coal industry and railway construction.

## 1949-52: Restoration period

Prior to 1931 there had been considerable industrial development, mainly in the northeast, where large coal mines had been developed first by British, German,

and Russian interests, and subsequently by the Japanese. However, much of this valuable infrastructure was destroyed in the wars that occurred between 1937 and 1949. During the restoration period, 1949-52, the major objectives were to gain control of coal supplies, reconstruct the existing mines, and concentrate all new coal mine construction in the northeast. 13

Yearly plans were drawn up during this period. The First National Economic Plan  for  Northeast  China was  formulated  in  1949,  and  subsequently  control figures were set by the Central Financial Commission for 1950, 1951, and 1952. 14 However,  these  control  figures  were  only  guidelines  given  to  the  large  coal bureaux;  they  were  not  industry-wide  targets.  By  the  end  of  1952  the  state had taken control of 88 per cent of the industry and production had been restored to  pre-1949 levels. 15 A target of 36.8 million tons was set for 1950 and 61.34 million tons for 1953. 16

The government immediately set about repairing the existing railway lines and bridges and commencing the construction of new lines in the northwest, southcentral, and southwest regions. At that time there were few lines in the northwest and southwest and there were no lines at all in Qinghai, Ningxia, or Xinjiang. What did exist were not of uniform gauge and the equipment was antiquated. By the end of 1952, the government had centralized the management of the railways and claimed that 22,900 km were functional.

## 1953-57: the First Five Year Plan

The First Five Y ear Plan was formulated with the assistance of Soviet advisers. Hundreds of Soviet technicians came to China, and many Chinese were sent to the Soviet Union for training. The latest Soviet mining technology was introduced into China as well as Soviet industrial management practices. In 1949 the Chinese first thought that some 175 shafts would have either to be closed or abandoned by 1955, but in 1952 after consultation with the Soviet advisers, it was estimated that not more than 60 shafts would have to be closed before 1957. 17 As part of their loan package, the Soviets provided almost all the rolling stock needed for industry start-up. 18 Of the 156 projects for which the Soviet Union and the other Eastern  Bloc  countries  were  providing  assistance  during  this  time,  24  were coal projects and the focus was on large mines and preparation plants. 19 The Poles are also said to have delivered at least five plants, in addition to contracting to supply 'complete equipment for two coal mines, three coal dressing plants and several smaller projects'. 20

Drafting of the First Five Y ear Plan began in the spring of 1951, but the Plan was not actually adopted until January 1955 at the Second Plenary Session of the National  People' s  Congress  (NPC).  (Only  the  first  and  second  five  year  plans were actually published, the former in great detail, the latter just in outline.) This highly detailed plan included some very specific guidelines for the development of the industry, with over half of the total investment allocated to the energy sector being for coal. The 1957 target set for coal production was 112,985 million tons, 78 per cent over the 1952 level.

Of the 1957 output target, 71.6 per cent was to come from state mines under central control, 20.0 per cent from state mines under local control, 4.2 per cent from joint state-private mines, 4.1 per cent from private mines, and 0.1 per cent from cooperatively operated mines. The economic utility of the LNS mines was recognized,  but  it  was  a  goal  (at  that  time)  eventually  to  phase  out  all  private mines either by closure or consolidation. Over the five-year period, construction was to have started on a total of 194 above-norm projects. Most of these were focused  in  the  established  northern  and  coastal  areas.  It  was  believed  that  'In order to change the irrational distribution of industry [in general, and from both economic and defence points of view], we must build up new industrial bases, but the  utilization,  reconstruction  and  extension  of  existing  industrial  bases  is  a prerequisite for the establishment of new industrial bases'. 21 Of the 179 mining construction projects, 57 were old shafts to be restored or reconstructed, while 122 were to be newly built, and 131 were in the northeast, north, and east regions. The  Fushun  (Liaoning),  Fuxin  (Liaoning),  Kailuan  (Hebei),  Datong  (Shanxi), and  Huainan  (Anhui)  administrations  were  designated  to  become  enterprises of  'exceptional  size' and  to  be  fitted  with  'new  or  even  the  most  up-to-date equipment'. 22

The  Soviet  planners  regarded  the  iron  and  steel  industry  as  the  basis  upon which all economic development depended and the targets set for them virtually determined the targets set for all the other industrial sectors. Necessarily, planning for the coal and iron and steel industries was carried out simultaneously. With strategic considerations in mind, the Soviets designated three plants - new ones in Wuhan (Hubei) and Baotou (Inner Mongolia), which are in the southcentre and northwest, respectively, and an upgraded Japanese-built plant, Anshan (Liaoning) in the northeast - to serve as the core of the industry. Other plants were built or upgraded at Benxi (Liaoning), Tianjin, Chongqing (Sichuan), Taiyuan (Shanxi), Maanshan (Anhui), and Shijingshan (west of Beijing).

Well before the First Five Y ear Plan was launched in 1955, it had become very apparent that coal production was lagging far behind demand. In August 1953 there was an urgent call from the Ministry of Fuel Industry and National Coal Mine Trade Union to increase production and intensify mine drivage. 23 However, the shortages were such that in the last half of 1953 and during 1954 all efforts were instead devoted to production, and mine development work was postponed until  1955. 24 Then in  1956,  because  Chairman  Mao  was  pressing  for  a  'High Tide' of production, targets for the 1956 Plan were again revised upwards. Thus, the First Five Y ear Plan was barely launched when Mao began interfering with it. In January of that year the number of above-norm capital construction projects for the First Five Y ear Plan was increased from 695 to 745, and the number of projects to be completed from 455 to 477. In June these targets were again raised, to 800 and 500, respectively.

Obviously much more coal was required than planned for earlier. The government  ordered  all  government  offices,  troops,  and  schools  to  reduce  coal  used for heating and cooking by 15-25 per cent and coal miners were asked to work overtime. 25 The Premier himself, Zhou Enlai, wrote several press articles at this

time urging people to save coal. 26 Rationing was introduced in 1957 and explicit directives for the assigning of coal supplies were detailed:

Ensure the  minimum, necessary supply to cities  lest  industrial  production and the livelihood of city people should be affected; basically maintain the 1956 supply level in respect to coal used by industries in general, handicrafts and service trades; reduce the coal used by (government) organs and organizations for heating purposes and the coal used for brick and tile kilns.

Appropriately reduce the supply of coal to the countryside â¦ Economizing in the use of coal and coke should be made an important feature of the production increase and economy campaign. Coal used by industry and service trades must be used economically; coal used by organs, army units, organizations  and  schools  should  be  placed  under  strict  control â¦ An  extensive propaganda drive should be launched to encourage the people to save coal. Moreover, exchange and popularization of coal-saving experiences should be organized from time to time. 27

In an effort to correct the imbalances in the supply of raw materials, revenues and expenditures, and bank credits, the 1957 budget for total investment in construction was readjusted to 20 per cent less than in 1956. 28 Other targets were also reduced, but the coal production target remained unchanged.

The details given for railway construction during the First Five Y ear Plan were also  very  specific. The  main  task  was  to  improve  and  reconstruct  the  existing railways. Another 3,284 km of new trunk lines were to be built and 800 km of branch lines. 29 Some 692km were to be rebuilt, spur lines were to be extended by 1,100 km, fourteen stations were to be enlarged, a new double-decker bridge was to be started over the Changjiang at Wuhan, and a considerable amount of new rolling stock was to be acquired. 30

## 1958-Spring-1960: the GLF overtakes the Second Five Year Plan

The proposed targets for the Second Five Y ear Plan, 1958-62, were adopted in September 1956. Among these was a target for 1962 calling for the number of provinces self-sufficient in coal to be raised from seven to seventeen. 31 The target for coal production in the same year was to be 190-210 million tons and for steel  10.5-12  million  tons.  By  the  time  the  Second  Five Y ear  Plan  began  in January 1958 the conservative and realistic plan for 1957, in tandem with a cautious budget, had begun to ameliorate the shortages and imbalances, but just at this time Mao announced his GLF. Mao called for the masses to become involved in a tremendous acceleration of growth in all sectors of the economy nationwide. He  had  always  believed  in  the  psychological  efficacy  of  unstable,  wavelike growth. The enormous surge he was calling for now was meant to raise confidence, and to give the people hope that China could break out of its poverty and catch up with the developed world.

Mao was frustrated by what he considered the slow pace of economic development in the preceding years. The Soviet advisers had been introducing relatively modern large-scale plants which inherently had long gestation periods. In the case of mining, some of the large centres they were helping to construct would take at least an entire decade before they reached full-scale production. Mao was not only displeased with the time factor, but also that it was only the urban areas and  already  developed  parts  of  the  country  which  were  benefiting  from  this approach, while conditions elsewhere had scarcely improved at all.

Mao agreed with the Soviets that 'steel was the key link' (yi gang wei gang) as it was imperative for both national defence and industrial development. However, he believed that smaller plants and less modern means of production, which could be used throughout the country, would be more appropriate and would realize faster economic growth. He also believed that there were large numbers of unemployed in the countryside who, if mobilized, could become a powerful productive force, referring to this latent energy as the 'superstructure' of ideology. 32 Mao had a history of distrusting intellectuals and bureaucracy and the GLF was a deliberate affront to them. A key GLF principle was 'walking on two legs' - the simultaneous development of large and small enterprises, the coexistence of modern and traditional methods, and a balancing of heavy industry, light industry, and agricultural sectors. Another of his concerns was that China might become indefinitely  reliant  on  the  Soviet  Union.  Mao  called  on  the  country  to  embrace  his vision of socialism, a 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', that is, maintaining central planning, but adapting it to the poor, rural conditions of China, by encouraging local initiative and self-sufficiency.

The structure of coal production in the GLF was completely transformed. In fact there was decentralization of authority in almost every sector of the economy. In January 1958 all enterprises and institutions under the General Administration of Capital Construction and the General Administration of Geological Exploration, and some designing institutes under the General Administration of Mine Designing, were put under the jurisdiction of provincial coal bureaux or CMAs concerned. All  the  CMAs,  enterprises,  and  institutions  were  granted  greater  authority  in planning, financing, materials and coal allocation, personnel management, and other matters. 33 In June 1958, apart from the central mines in the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Yunnan, and Guizhou, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and those under the Beijing Mining Administration, all mines attached to units under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Coal Industry (MCI) were transferred  to  the  jurisdiction  of  people' s  commissions  in  the  provinces  and autonomous regions.

In  September  1958  the  MCI  established  a  special  office  to  coordinate  coal production  for  the  GLF  campaign, 34 and  in  October  large-  and  medium-sized mines were directed to develop satellite small-scale pits. 35 By the mid-1950s all non-state  mines  had  been  put  under  local  Party  management.  Influenced  by Soviet central planning with its emphasis on large-scale operations, the government hitherto had offered the operators of these mines little financial or material support  and  output  was  consumed  locally.  However,  this  had  begun  to  change

dramatically in 1957. It had been recognized that output from the non-state mines was growing much faster than from the state mines and increasing output from this sector was now seen to be the best way to solve the immediate coal crisis. 36 Accordingly, explicit instructions were issued:

Organize small collieries to produce coal and ensure fulfillment and overfulfillment  of  the  procurement  targets  for  coal  and  construction  supplies companies. Small collieries may be organized to produce coal as long as their operation does not undermine the state resources and as long as coal can be shipped out â¦ As production and transportation costs are high for coal produced by small collieries, any losses incurred during procurement of coal may be reported to the Ministry of Commerce, which will make good the losses. 37

In April 1957 the Government allocated 11.6 million yuan for the promotion of forty 'native-style' pits in nineteen provinces. 38 Then at the enlarged conference of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee in August 1958 one of the documents promulgated was The Call on the Whole Party and the Whole People to Strive to Produce 10.7 Million Tons of Steel . 39 It was proclaimed that if everyone participated in the 'backyard furnace campaign' and the 'native pits campaign', China could surpass Britain' s steel output. The MCI had initially set a target of 150.72 million tons for 1958, about 15 per cent over the actual amount produced in 1957, and of which almost one-third was to come from non-state mines. 40 In May of 1958 it was estimated that production would reach 180 million tons, or 38  per  cent  over  the  1957  level. 41 Later  the  target  was  raised  again,  to  220.8 million tons, or 69 per cent over the 1957 level, in order to meet the higher steel output target. The 10.7 million tons steel target was double the 1957 output and the 1959 target was also set very high at 27 to 30 million tons. The capital investment allocated to the coal industry in 1958 was twice what it was in 1957 and in 1959 there was yet another 33 per cent increase.

Slogans were struck to characterize the strategies to be employed. The 'Four Halves' method called  on  peasants,  traders,  students,  and  villagers  to  work  as half-time industrial workers. The 'Four Simultaneous' method called for simultaneous  building  and  producing,  prospecting  and  mining,  mining  and  smelting, producing and studying. The 'Four Quicks' method urged managers and workers to start quick, build quick, produce quick, sell quick. 42

By the end of 1958 some 20 million people were working in 110,000 small pits  scattered  all  around  the  country,  not  just  in  the  major  mining  areas.  The proportion of total output from the CMAs fell from over 72 per cent in 1957 to 58 per cent in 1958, while that from the LNS mines rose from 5 per cent to 19 per cent. The people used any implements available, including kitchen utensils, to dig  the  coal,  and  whereas  the  Communist  government  had  hitherto  forbidden women  to  work  in  the  mines,  during  this  period  this  policy  was  abandoned. Inexperience and inadequate preparation and equipment resulted in the death or injury  of  many  people. The  smelting  furnaces  were  small  and  inefficient  and

required proportionately more fuel than the large state plants to produce the same heat because the coal from the pits was of such poor quality, much of it being mixed with sand, rocks, and clay. In turn the iron and steel produced were largely unusable.

The phenomenal pace of growth of the LNS mines and the production of inferior quality coal and other basic materials could not continue. The strain on capital and human resources was too great and the mining equipment and structure of the nation' s coal seams were actually being damaged. Nor could the diversion of  labour  from  the  agricultural  sector  continue  any  longer. The  economy  was beginning to falter. However, the fractious political situation at the time precluded the  development  of  a  comprehensive  plan,  and  the  steel  and  coal  targets  were adjusted and readjusted several times in the coming months.

In  November  1958  the  target  for  steel  in  1959  was  lowered  from  27-30  to 18-20 million tons, for pig iron from 40 million tons to 29, for machine tools from 300,000 to 130,000 pieces, and for total investment in capital construction from 50 billon yuan to 36 billion, but the coal target was actually raised from 370 to 380 million tons. 43 At a conference in March 1959, the Minister affirmed that the northeast, north, and east would remain the main development areas. 44 Then in April, while the coal target was unchanged at 380 million tons, the steel target was readjusted downwards from 20 to 18 million tons, total investment in capital construction was reduced from 36 billion yuan to 26-28 billion, and the number of large- and medium-sized projects was reduced from 1,500 to 1,000. 45 Soon after, the steel target was further reduced to 13 million tons, the coal target to 340 million tons, and the targets for copper, aluminium, cement, and timber were also reduced. 46 Finally, in August the steel target was set at 12 million tons, the coal target at 335 million tons, the total capital construction investment target at 24.8 billion yuan, and the number of large- and medium-sized construction projects at 788. 47 During this period, as a result of wildly exaggerated reports from low level managers, and the fact that so many pits were involved, the planners really did not know just how much coal was being produced.

Another great surge was planned for 1960 and the targets for a variety of commodities were set 10-57 per cent above 1959 production levels. The steel target for that year was first put at 18.4 million tons, and then in March raised to 20.4 million tons. 48 Despite the fact that the 1959 coal target had not been met, for 1960 it was set unrealistically high at 462 million tons, then subsequently lowered to 425 million tons, or 33 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively above the 1959 output. 49 The GLF spurt had now passed and coal production was in fact falling, the main cause of the decline being the failure to build new shafts and tunnels. During the GLF the output-capacity ratio had become skewed and mine development work had fallen seriously behind. Despite awareness of this, the Ministry condoned the diversion of capital and labour from construction to production. The miners were now exhausted and cynical towards the government.

In  December  1959,  in  order  to  regain  control  of  production,  the  Central Committee and State Council revoked some of the powers it had given to lower jurisdictions  the  year  before.  In  Heilongjiang,  Hunan,  Jiangxi, Anhui,  Henan,

Shandong, Jilin,  and  Inner  Mongolia,  a  dual  system  of  jurisdiction  was  established in which the central government reclaimed the dominant role. 50

In 1958 and 1959 the increases in the allocations of capital investment to the railways were very high and there were large advances made in new trackage and double-tracking, especially in the northwest and southwest regions. The uncharacteristically high increases in coal production in the GLF years were more than the railways could handle. Some 20 million tons of coal had accumulated at the mines for lack of railway capacity. 51

## Spring 1960-65: departure of the Soviet personnel, a period of readjustment, and the beginning of the Third Front Development Programme

By the spring of 1960 the Soviet advisers had become frustrated and angry with what they considered the reckless policies of the GLF. This, in combination with various political problems, precipitated Krushchev to order the Soviet technical personnel to return home and bring all their blueprints with them. 52 They had been in China for almost a decade. Thus, China abandoned the 'leaning to one side' strategy, that is, participating in a united front with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries against the US and Japan. During the decade now beginning virtually no assistance from either socialist or capitalist countries would be sought  or  received.  Mao  pursued  a  policy  of  self-reliance,  convinced  that  if Chinese scientists interacted with those from abroad for any length of time, China would become irreversibly dependent on the more developed world, and would never reach the status of a world power.

The  termination  of  the  Soviet  assistance,  especially  at  this  juncture,  was a major setback for the coal industry, which was experiencing an assortment of very serious problems. In January 1961, the CPC Central Committee had little choice but to approve a proposal that the daily production quota for the CMAs be reduced from 650,000 to 600,000 tons for the first quarter of the year. 53 Then in May the quota was further reduced to 530,000 tons. 54 In early July, however, only 460,000 tons were actually being mined and at this point the MCI ordered that the daily quota be maintained at 520,000 tons. 55 This was impossible, and at  the  National  Coal  Cadres  Meeting  in  September  the  daily  quota  for  the September-December period was set at 440,000 tons. 56 The Coal Report to the Central Authorities (August 1961) stated that at least 122 of the 278 state mines and 788 pits were behind in preparation work. 57 In September the Party Central Committee issued the Directive on Current Industrial Problems , which stipulated among other things, that due to the low production, attention should be paid to both the quantity and quality of coal. 58 In 1961 and 1962 the government, now dominated  by  the  'pragmatists',  allocated  over  one-fifth  of  the  total  available industrial investment funding to the coal industry and coal investment as a proportion of investment in energy reached a high of almost 57 per cent in 1961. But the actual amounts allocated steadily dropped between 1960 and 1963.

Clearly, the GLF had caused planning to collapse. Throughout 1961 and 1962 desperate attempts were made to raise the morale of the miners. In January the miners at the state mines were given increased food rations, 59 and in October they were granted extra supplies of wine, liquor, meat, vegetable oil, cigarettes, sugar, and other items. 60 In April 1962 Mao's rival, Premier Zhou Enlai, called for still further inducements by implementing a voluntary working system in the mines, establishing a 'Miners' Day', providing uniforms, and giving subsidies according to seniority. 61 Due to the lack of capacity, production was still very low in 1962 and in June it was decided to reduce the daily quotas yet again, from 412,200 tons in the third quarter and 420,000 tons in the fourth, to 390,000 and 400,000 tons, respectively. 62

In January 1962 the government had called for a period of 'readjustment, consolidation, filling out and raising standards' to correct the problems caused by the GLF, and by severe floods and droughts which had occurred in the early 1960s. Due to the failure of the GLF, with its attendant devastation, Mao was forced to step back and allow the 'pragmatists' more decision-making power. In the coal industry  the  number  of  new  construction  projects  was  reduced,  attempts  were made to balance the output-capacity ratio, repairs were made to the equipment and roadways, and there was a restructuring of the work organizations and restoring of rules and regulations. 63 At the enlarged Standing Committee of the Political Bureau in February, the original economywide targets for 1962 were scaled down. The coal target was reduced from 251 million tons to 239, and the steel target from 7.5 million tons to 6 million. 64 Also in February the MCI established a LongTerm Planning Committee. 65

At the end of 1964, in his report to the Third National People' s Congress, Zhou Enlai called for 'Four Modernizations' - modernization before the end of the century of agriculture, industry, national defence, and science and technology - to bring China's national economy to the forefront in the world. To accomplish this he advocated the use of modern, foreign technology, thus beginning a reversal of Mao's self-reliance policy. Several efforts were made to re-centralize authority and in August 1963 it was formally recommended that 'production be rationally centralized  and  new  technology  be  introduced'. 66 In  January  and  February  of 1965 various mines were shifted to other jurisdictions or re-named, and the MCI reorganized  its  ten  departments,  one  bureau,  and  one  office  into  four  offices: Production, Capital Construction, Management, and Planning, and merged the Policy Research Office into the General Office. 67

By this time almost all of the small pits opened during the GLF had closed and attention  was  focused  on  the  large  state  mines  which  the  Soviet  advisers  had helped to restore or construct during the First Five Y ear Plan. The output structure of  production,  that  is  the  proportions  of  output  coming  from  the  various  mine types, had almost completely returned to what it had been before the GLF. Over 70 per cent of the total production was now coming from the CMAs, and only 30 per cent from the local mines. Instead of directing the peasants to operate small mines and to use the coal for local industrial and household use, more effort was directed to developing coal-fired thermal plants. No new mines were started.

## 44 Mao's adaptation of Soviet central planning

New railway construction had been limited by the failure of the GLF and the departure of the Soviet engineers. The amount of capital allocated to the railways as a percentage of total investment in transportation and communications had reached an all-time high of almost 72 per cent in 1961, but between 1962 and 1964, as a proportion of total economywide investment, the amount allocated to the railways dropped to only about half of what it had been in the First Five Y ear Plan period. In 1965, however, with the recovery of the economy in general and the launching of the Third  Front  Development  Programme  late  the  previous  year,  the  amount  of investment allocated to the railways rose sharply. Most of this new construction took place in the northwest and southcentral regions, and by the end of 1965, apart from Tibet, all the provinces and autonomous regions were linked by rail.

The purpose of the Third Front Development Programme, which began in late 1964 and ended in late 1971, was to establish an integrated, self-sufficient industrial base in the interior of the country, strategically located and less vulnerable to attack from land or air. At that time, the Chinese leadership was paranoid about potential attacks from both the US and Soviet Union. Atom and hydrogen bombs were  tested  by  the  Chinese  in  1964  and  1969,  respectively. The  Guomindang was fully aware of the Mainland' s fragile economic situation after the failure of the  GLF,  and  backed  by  the  US,  was  threatening  to  base  nuclear  missiles on Taiwan. Also, by that time, the Americans were fully involved in the Vietnam War. Relations with the Soviet Union since the abrupt break-off in 1960 were worsening. The Chinese Communist leaders believed that the Third Front region, encompassing the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, the section of Shaanxi south of the Qinling mountains, and the western mountainous areas of Henan, Hubei, and Hunan would be the most secure against penetration. The coastal region, or First Front, and the Second Front which lay between the First and Third Fronts, were deemed far too vulnerable.

Over the eight-year period, extremely large capital investments were made in remote  areas  within  the  Third  Front  region.  There  was  large-scale  transfer  of industrial plants and research facilities from the coast and massive construction of new ones. Mao instructed that new railway lines be built in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan 'at maximum speed, even if this involved tearing up tracks elsewhere to obtain rails'. 68 One of the key projects was a huge iron and steel plant at Panzhihua in  a  very  mountainous  area  on  the  border  between  Sichuan  and Yunnan. This installation required new coal mines and new railway lines. Several mines were built  in  the  area  and  the  connecting  Chongqing  (Sichuan)-Guiyang  (Guizhou) and  the  Kunming-Guiyang railway lines  were  completed  in  October  1965  and mid-1966, respectively. Smaller iron and steel plants were also built at Jiuquan (Gansu), Shuicheng (Guizhou), and Wuyang (Henan).

## 1966-70: the Third Five Year Plan and the beginning of the Cultural Revolution

The  draft  of  the Third  Five Y ear  Plan  (1966-70)  was  presented  in  September 1965, and the target for coal in 1970 was a realistic 280-290 million tons, 21-25

per cent or 48-58 million tons over 1965. 69 Initially, the main goal of this Plan was  to  continue  restoring  the  economy,  laying  equal  emphasis  on  agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry in order to provide the population with basic food, clothing, and other consumer goods. However, with the escalation of the Vietnam War there was a return to orienting the economy to heavy industry. Then in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution.

The  Cultural  Revolution  was  a  sociopolitical  campaign  to  put  power  back into the hands of the Marxists and the masses, thus taking it away from those he perceived to be 'counter-revolutionary revisionists' (his 'pragmatic' rivals) and capitalists, feudalists and exploiters of one sort or another. It lasted from 1966 to 76. The first stage, 1966-70, affected the economy more severely than the second and the social and economic consequences, like those of the GLF, were devastating. Thousands of intellectuals, writers, and artists were sent to the countryside to 'learn from the masses', or were tortured or killed. Publication of scientific and literary periodicals was halted, and all religious activities were prohibited. Families were separated, factories were closed, crops were not planted, and the discipline of economics, regarded as the root of the problem, was virtually banned. 70

Coal industry officials today estimate that the Cultural Revolution set the coal industry  back  by  at  least  twenty  years.  The  worst  years  were  1967  and  1968. Production in 1967, compared to that of 1966, dropped 18 per cent and there were repeated calls to use the available supplies sparingly. 71 Average output at the mine faces decreased from 7,342 tons per month in 1966 to 5,800 tons in 1967. 72 The work of the Institute of Geology was seriously interrupted by factionalism within its membership and in January the Minister of Coal Industry, Zhang Linzhi, was killed. 73 Management and administration were thrown into confusion and physical planning norms for the use of materials were abandoned. The military took over several  of  the  key  bureaux  and,  because  the  political  cadres  had  no  industrial expertise,  equipment  was  not  maintained.  In  December  the  MCI  issued  strong warnings to individuals trying to procure coal themselves. In digging the coal by whatever means they could, they were destroying the potentially rich coal seams belonging to the state mines. Again, as in the GLF, many people were killed in accidents, and the output was of poor quality. Much of the younger work force was giving more time to political campaigns than to mining. Shortages forced many coalconsuming enterprises to operate well under capacity or halt production altogether.

In  May  1968  the  CPC  Central  Committee  requested  fifteen  major  mines  to hold a conference on increasing production and meeting the basic needs of the economy. 74 It  is  apparent  from  the  literature  that  the  economists  and  scientists were aware of the enormous waste in energy consumption and the potential for reducing it. 75 In late 1969 the SPC called a conference to study ways of ensuring a stable output of steel and the MCI was requested to guarantee 4,700 tons of clean coal per day to be used by designated steel plants. 76

The  problems  in  the  coal  industry  reflected  the  reality  that  the  Cultural Revolution had upset the entire planning apparatus. The National Conference of Planning, which had been suspended for two years, was replaced by a forum of about thirty people from the military, veteran cadres, and representatives from the

mass organizations. This group formulated a draft of An Outline of the Plan of the 1969  National  Economy and  the  coal  target  suggested  was  270-280  million tons. 77 In the 1970 plan, which was approved in September of that year by the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth Party Central Committee, the targets were those set in 1965 for the Third Five Y ear Plan, that is, for coal, 280-290 million tons. The main thrust of the Plan was the promotion of the 'five local industries' iron and steel, machine-building, chemical fertilizer, coal mining, and cement. The  policy  for  LNS  mines  was  reversed  and  their  development  was  widely encouraged to make up for the lost production in 1967-68. Attention shifted from concentrating development in the north and northeast to making all regions selfsufficient. 78 Mao was determined to reduce the concentration of industry in the north and eastern regions, or First and Second Fronts, and to shift more industrial strength to the Third Front. 79 Between 1966 and 1970, most of the investment allocated specifically to the coal industry went to the southwest region. 80

The small pits, which had been built in the late 1950s and had been abandoned, were re-opened. By 1970 much of the centralization of authority reimposed after the GLF was now reversed. Most enterprises and prospecting teams were transferred from the jurisdiction of the Ministry back to local authorities, and other organizations were put under joint jurisdiction. 81 This sharing of authority, even in  the  largest  state  mines,  proved  highly  inefficient  because  the  division  of responsibilities and accountability were never precisely defined.

As for the railways, in the early years of the Cultural Revolution factionalism resulted in the closure of some lines, while others were permitted only limited traffic.  In  travelling  all  over  the  country  'making  revolution',  the  Red  Guards occupied  freight  capacity  and  worsened  the  coal  stockpiling  problem.  They prevented many workers from doing their jobs and there were reports of tracks actually being removed or blown up. The Taiyuan Railway Bureau - Taiyuan was probably the most important coal transfer point - was occupied and used as a bargaining chip. In January 1967 coal shipments on the railways were 3.8 million tons less than planned, and, due to the fighting, in September only 46 per cent of the  planned  number  of  cars  were  loaded  per  day. 82 There  were  only  minimal increases  in  new  construction  and  double-tracking  between  1966  and  1968, though these were resumed immediately after the worst of the violence was over. Some major lines were built in the Third Front region, the Chengdu-Kunming line and the Jiazuo (Henan)-Zhicheng (Sichuan) line, plus three different routes to Vietnam.  The  peak  that  was  reached  in  1960  of  total  freight  carried  on  the railways was finally surpassed in 1970, the same year the administration of the railways was decentralized. Instead of having the twenty railway administrations directly under the Ministry of Railways, they were given more autonomy and the Ministry as a whole was merged with the Ministry of Communications.

## 1971-75: the Fourth Five Year Plan

The Fourth Five Y ear Plan (1971-75) was discussed in September 1970 at the Second Plenary Session of the Ninth Party Central Committee. 83 A coal target of

400-430 million tons was set for 1975. 84 This modest target (total production in 1970 had been 354 million tons) with a wide range - it would have entailed an annual increment of 9.2 to 15.2 million tons - would seem to indicate that the planners were not wanting to force production. The target for 1971, set soon after, was 360-370 million tons. 85

In September 1971 Lin Biao was killed and Zhou Enlai, a strong advocate of the methodical Soviet-type planning, was in control. 86 At that time, rapprochement with the US was in process and the military threat was greatly reduced. US President Nixon visited Beijing in February 1972, following China' s acquisition of  a  permanent  seat  on  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  in  October  the previous year. This set in motion Japan' s reappraisal of its relationship with China and by September that year the newly elected Japanese Prime Minister, Kakuei Tanaka, and Zhou Enlai had signed a joint communique normalizing relations between  the  two  countries,  marking  the  beginning  of  China' s  gradual  reestablishment of diplomatic ties with the non-Communist world.

On the world energy scene a defining event which later became known as the 'first oil shock' occurred in October 1973 when all members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) joined Saudi Arabia in reducing oil production and placing embargoes on exports to pressure the US and its allies into forcing Israel to leave Arab land that had been seized in 1967 and 1973. Oil prices more than quadrupled in less than a year and a lack of fuel supplies led to inflation and recession throughout the capitalist world. Governments scrambled to establish rationing and conservation measures. China, however, relying almost  entirely  on  its  own  energy  supplies,  and  involved  in  virtually  no  trade outside the Communist Bloc, was not affected.

With the Chinese economy suffering from the effects of the Cultural Revolution and  over-extension  in  the  backward Third  Front  region,  Zhou  immediately  set new priorities. The Third Front Programme was ended and attempts were made to complete the largest of the unfinished projects. He also began limited business, training, and cultural exchanges with Western countries. In 1974 some thirty fully mechanized coal mining systems were imported from England and Germany.

In  the  coal  industry,  Zhou  focused  attention  on  the  need  to  increase  mine capacity work which had fallen behind during both the GLF and the early years of  the  Cultural  Revolution.  This  was  the  main  topic  of  discussion  at  various conferences sponsored by the Ministry throughout the year. 87 It was decided to postpone  several  new  projects  until  the  following  year  and  to  cancel  others. Prospecting projects already underway were to be completed as rapidly as possible. The target for 1973, set in January of that year, was only 390-396 million tons. 88 At the National Conference on Planning in July 1973 some of the industrial targets were adjusted downwards. For example, the steel target was changed from 35-40 to 30 million tons. 89 In September that year an investigation into the country's coal stocks revealed they were sufficient to last only 1.5 months. 90 In October the government again called for economization in coal consumption. 91

It appeared as though the industry would now enjoy a period of stability when production was again disrupted by political events in September 1974. This time

it was the 'Campaign Against Lin Biao and Confucius', which resulted in more factionalism and purges. 92 The 1974 Plan had been drafted in August 1973, but due to the political turmoil it was not possible to convene a National Planning Conference and the Plan was approved by the central authorities without a meeting. 93 The State Council acknowledged in April 1974 that coal shortages were preventing many industries from meeting their targets. 94 The crisis was of such proportions that in June 1975 an emergency meeting was held and the miners were ordered to strive for higher output, despite the hot summer weather, and to make up for the production shortfall experienced in the first half of the year. 95

In the early 1970s several major extensions were made to the railway network in the Third Front region, including a line connecting Hunan and Guizhou and the Chongqing (Sichuan)-Wuhan (Hubei) line via Ankang (Shaanxi) and Xiangfan (Hubei), but the Campaign Against Lin Biao and Confucius was extremely detrimental to the railways. 96 Few trains were in service and many of the freight handlers in the yards refused to work. The result was stockpiling of coal at the mines and shortages throughout the country. Between January and October 1974 only 57.9 per cent of the freight trains out of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau ran on schedule. 97 On 5 March 1975, the Party Central Committee issued the Decision on  Strengthening  Railroad Work in  which  a  separate  ministry  for  the  railways was re-established and the autonomy given the twenty administrations in 1970 was  rescinded.  The Decision stressed  the  need  for  punctual  departures  and announced severe punishment for persons disrupting service. Several personnel in the Ministry were removed at that time. 98

The year 1975 marked a turning point for the coal industry and the economy as a whole. The MCI was re-established in January, after being taken over by the Ministry of Fuel and Chemical Industries in November 1970. Xu Jinqiang was appointed Minister. Also, Zhou Enlai that month in his Report on the Work of the Government ,  reaffirmed  his  two  goals  given  at  the  First  Session  of  the  Fourth National People's Congress 11 years earlier, in December 1964: to build up an independent,  comprehensive  industrial  and  national  economic  system  before 1980, and to bring about the Four Modernizations. 99 This was the beginning of a fresh  vision  for  China,  an  attempt  to  put  the  country  on  a  new  programme  of development.

The coal target set in the National Economic Plan for 1975, and approved at the Party Central Committee in February that year was 430 million tons, 4.7 per cent over 1974, and a target of 480 million tons was set for 1976. 100 The 1975 target for steel was initially 26 million tons, but was soon revised downward to 24 million because problems in the supplies of raw materials continued. Several other targets were readjusted downwards but the 1976 coal target was not changed. 101

The promotion of LS and LNS mines was accelerated during this period. By 1975 only 58 per cent of the total output came from the CMAs. In 1972 the state began to allot a special fund for technical transformation of LS and LNS mines 102 and in 1973 a conference was convened with the particular purpose of examining production and construction of local mines in nine southern provinces to relieve the pressure on the north-south railway lines. 103

## 1976-78: the years immediately prior to the reforms

An earthquake which occurred soon after the beginning of the Fifth Five Y ear Plan  (1976-80)  at  Tangshan  (Hebei)  was  a  serious  setback  for  the  industry. Whereas the national production growth rate in 1975 was 16.7 per cent, it was only 0.3 per cent in 1976. Not only was production halted but railway lines in the  area  had  to  be  rebuilt.  It  was  also  about  this  time  it  was  realized  that  the major  oilfields,  Daqing  (Heilongjiang)  and  Shengli  (Shandong),  had  reached their peak production. The coal output target for 1977 was set at only 490-500 million tons. 104

Also momentous were the deaths of both Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong in 1976. The country was again in turmoil until the Gang of Four was arrested and Hua Guofeng was finally installed as the new Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 1978. 105 In 1977 the first signs of an outwardlooking policy associated with Deng Xiaoping had become apparent. 106 During the 1950s the economy, especially the coal industry, had received considerable assistance from the Soviet Union, but after their personnel left in 1960 there was little collaboration in any field with other countries. Deng saw opening to the rest of the world, especially to the West, as crucial to the country' s development and modernization. In the case of the coal industry, he believed that coal exports could potentially  be  a  significant  source  of  foreign  exchange,  and  that  in  order  to increase these it would be necessary to introduce foreign technology and equipment and focus on efficiency. 107 In 1978 alone, 100 sets of comprehensive mechanized mining equipment were purchased from abroad. He also recognized an opportunity for China in the oil crisis that had affected the West and which had caused the international price of coal to more than double from US$18.23 in 1972 to US$46.43 in 1975. 108

Deng was also very eager to develop the LS and LNS mines, and to this end in 1977 he instructed that tax policies affecting them be relaxed. 109 As coal supplies continued to be inadequate, the MCI held meetings in January and May with the SPC, Beijing Municipal Committee, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways to discuss improving the flow of coal supplies, 110 and in July the State Council decided to raise the coal output target by 10 million tons and to transport an extra 7 million. 111 That month Xiao Han replaced Xu Jinqiang as Minister of the Coal Industry. The question of output-capacity figured prominently at various meetings during the year. In March there was a conference on exploiting the full potential of old mines, and the issue of preparing sufficient mining capacity was raised. 112

In  February  1978  Hua  presented The Outline for the Ten-Year Plan for the Development  of  the  National  Economy and  a Report  on  the  Work  of  the Government . Two years of the ten-year period from 1976 to 1985 had, in fact, already passed. In the Report he announced that 'â¦ the state plans to build or complete 120 large-scale projects including ten iron and steel complexes, nine non-ferrous  metal  complexes,  eight  coal  mines,  ten  oil  and  gas  fields,  thirty power  stations, â¦' and  gave  notice  that  'All  provinces,  municipalities  and

autonomous  regions  must  utilize  local  resources,  strive  to  make  a  success  of medium-scale  and  small  coalfields,  small  power  stations,  small  mines,  small cement  factories,  small  fertilizer  factories â¦'. 113 Energy  development  was regarded as the key to the success of the Ten-Y ear Economic Plan as it was an essential input into every industrial sector.

A steel target of 60 million tons was set for 1985, up from 24 million tons in 1977. Steel was still regarded as 'the key link'. Negotiations had begun in 1977 with  the  Japanese  to  construct  an  ultramodern  steel  complex  at  Baoshan  in Shanghai. 114 However, it was the targets specifically for coal, revealed as part of the Ten-Y ear  Plan  by  Minister  Xiao  Han,  that  were  especially  ambitious. The stated goal was to double output in ten years, and double it again before the end of the century. It was also planned that every county in China would produce coal, that every area would be self-sufficient in 'about ten years' time'. He suggested five measures to attain these goals: improve management of the industry, fully use old mines, develop more small LNS mines, improve marketing of the coal, and raise the level of mechanization at the mines. 115

Such high targets were set because the lack of energy supplies continued to affect growth in every sector of the economy, and it was realized that the Four Modernizations could never succeed without reliable and expanding sources. 116 Convening an emergency national conference by telephone in July 1978, Vice Premier Kang Shien urged 'all coal mines to take immediate action to reverse the passive situation of coal production'. 117

Hua called for recentralization of authority in all ministries. In the coal industry it was decided that efforts to increase mechanization and training were best coordinated by the MCI itself, as opposed to the mine administrators. Several research  institutes  were  put  under  the  dual  jurisdiction  of  the  MCI  and  the provinces, with the former assuming the principal role. 118 Deng advocated that equipment for mechanized mining should be concentrated in a relatively small number of mines in order that it could be used to maximum efficiency and be well maintained. 119

In August 1978 the Bureau of Local Coal Mines was established by the MCI, and in September Deng affirmed that while in the past the government had advocated 'Two Initiatives' - the central government on the one hand and the provinces and  municipalities  on  the  other  -  more  authority  should  now  be  given  to  the 'grass-roots mines and plants'. 120 The government had by then firmly decided to make coal the basis of their long-term energy strategy and this policy was formally proposed in April 1978 at a National Working Conference on Practising Economy. 121 Though the Chinese had at that time really no choice but to use coal, they were not unaware of the potential of nuclear power in helping to solve the country's energy problems. Towards the end of that year negotiations began with the French company Framatone to build a nuclear plant.

It was quickly realized that all the targets set in the Ten-Y ear Plan (1976-85) were far beyond the capabilities of the economy. The Plan had called for enormous increases in output that were to be brought about with the help of large imports of foreign equipment and technology. But such imports were, in fact, limited because

the country had only minimal reserves of foreign exchange. Hua and others evidently believed that the economic problems had been due solely to the political disruptions and that the economic situation would quickly recover with the fall of the Gang of Four. 122 He was either overly optimistic or ignorant of the complexity of the problems, probably a combination of the two. In his work report he stated:

[The Gang of Four] sabotaged the national economy and disrupted socialist construction in every field â¦ As a result â¦ between 1974 and 1976 the nation lost about 100 billion yuan in total value of industrial output, 28 million tons of steel, and 40 billion yuan in state revenues, and the whole economy was on the brink of collapse. 123

As the results of the first statistical surveys which did not come available until late 1978 and early 1979, Hua' s advisers did not have any data upon which to base accurate plans. 124

There was virtually no new railway construction in 1976 and due to the activities of the Gang of Four, service was greatly disrupted. The situation improved in 1977 and 1978 and whereas the amount of capital construction investment allocated to the railways actually fell sharply in 1976 and 1977, it was substantially increased in 1978. However, as a share of investment in the transportation and communications  sector  and  of  total  economywide  investment,  the  allocations were far less than what they had been during the First Five Y ear Plan period.

Mao's revolutionary zeal and manipulative propensity produced periods of economic catastrophe, compounding the deeply rooted systemic problems that began before the Cultural Revolution. By the mid-1970s both agricultural and industrial growth had begun to slow down. The goal of doubling coal output to 1.24 billion tons in ten years would have required an annual growth rate of over 7 per cent. While the average growth rate between 1953 and 1975 was higher at 11.4 per cent, a 7 per cent annual growth rate after 1978 would have been difficult to sustain.  Partly  due  to  the  unrealistically  ambitious  goals  of  the  Ten-Y ear  Plan, a power struggle ensued and Deng Xiaoping emerged as paramount leader of the country in late 1978. In April 1979 it was formally decided at a Party Working Conference that the economy should undergo 'readjustment, restructuring, consolidating and improving' for a period of three years. Hua Guofeng' s ambitious plans for the economy were abandoned. In the following years a major, if not the most important component of the economic plans dealt with increasing energy supplies.

## 3 Economic assessment of the industry on the eve of the reform and opening up programme

## Production

## Quantity, structure, quality, and geographical distribution

In  1978,  two  years  after  the  death  of  Mao  and  on  the  eve  of  the  reform  and opening up programme, China's coal production at nearly 618 million tons ranked third in the world after the US and USSR, up from ninth in 1949. Between 1953, the first year of the First Five Y ear Plan, and 1978, production in China increased by almost 800 per cent, compared to 124 per cent in the USSR, and 187 per cent in India.

By 1953 most developed countries had begun to replace coal with oil, gas, and electricity, and in the 1970s the USSR had begun to use more gas than coal. Oil went from accounting for 14, 40, and 5 per cent of total energy consumption in Western Europe, US, and Japan, respectively in 1950, to 56, 44, and 69 per cent in  1970. 1 Coal  production  peaked  in  France  at  60.04  million  tons  in  1958,  in Japan at 55.79 in 1961, in the FRG at 253.15 in 1964, and in Ukraine at 218.16 in 1976. 2 There were long periods of coal over-supply in world markets. Though mining unions fought bitterly to keep their industry alive, the mandates required to continue the huge subsidization were economically and politically impossible, and mines were gradually being closed down beginning in the 1970s. 3

That  China  was  able  to  realize  such  growth,  and  with  minimal  capital  and skilled labour, is especially remarkable given that almost all the coal came from underground mines. In the 1950s, with Soviet help,  the  Chinese  largely  abandoned the room and pillar method of underground mining in favour of the longwall method (see Chapter 1, endnote no. 30). In 1949 only about 13 per cent of the total output was cut using the longwall method, but by 1957 almost 93 per cent of the total output was so derived. 4 In 1978 opencast mining, which is relatively uncomplicated  and  therefore  less  costly  in  the  long  run,  accounted  for  only 2.8 per cent of total production in China, 5 whereas it accounted for 61 per cent in the US in 1977, 32 per cent in the USSR in 1975, and 26 per cent in India in 1979. 6

Total production in 1978 could probably have been much larger had the outputcapacity ratio (discussed in more detail below) not been badly upset by the GLF and  Cultural  Revolution.  The  effects  of  these  socioeconomic  experiments  are

Figure 3.1 Total coal production, 1949-78

<!-- image -->

clearly apparent in Figure 3.1, which plots total output between 1949 and 1978. The  corresponding  total  output  figures  and  annual  increments  are  given  in Table 3.1. The production peak of over 397 million tons, attained in 1960 at the zenith of the GLF, was not surpassed until 1972.

Despite these remarkable outputs and rates of growth, at no point during the almost thirty years was production adequate to meet all needs. By 1952 production  had  recovered  to  the  pre-1949  peak.  However,  with  the  restoration  of  the economy in the early 1950s demand immediately far outstripped supply, and then Mao's experiments worsened the already critical situation. Planning was in chaos in the late 1960s. Several senior personnel in the Ministries of Coal and Railways had either been killed or sent to the countryside. Moreover, the rigidities of topdown central  planning  virtually  precluded  direct  communications  between  the two Ministries. Production was far outpacing transport capacity, but the planners in Beijing seemed oblivious to this.

Table  3.2  gives  the  output  that  came  from  the  various  types  of  mines,  and Table  3.3  gives  this  information  in  percentages  of  the  total.  The 1982  Coal Industry Yearbook ,  in  a  retrospective  section,  gives  no  figures  for  output  from provincial and county mines in 1949 and 1957. The most likely explanation is that the three distinct mine categories - provincial, prefectural, and county - were not distinguished until the early 1960s. The CMAs accounted for about 72 per cent of total production over the First Five Y ear Plan, but when peasants nationwide were ordered to mine coal during the GLF their share decreased to 58 per cent. By 1965 the dominant role of the CMAs had almost returned to what it had been in

Note: According to the above source 367.21 million tons were produced in 1960. It is assumed that this is a misprint because both TJNJ 1981 , p. 223 and GJJJTJZL , p. 50, give 397.00 million tons (both of these sources supply only rounded figures) and Sinton et al . give 397.2 million tons for that year.

1957, but thereafter the proportion of total output from them steadily declined to only 55 per cent in 1978.

Table 3.4 gives the annual growth rates of total production and production from the CMAs and local mines. Total coal production grew at an average annual rate of 12.8 per cent over the entire period. After the GLF there were four years of negative growth. Due to mass starvation, the main priority of the peasants had to be food production. In 1965 and 1966 the growth of total production averaged over 8 per cent per year, but in 1967, due to the Cultural Revolution, it fell by over 18 per cent. Political disruption affected the industry again in 1973, 1974, and 1976. However, despite the ongoing political instability, remarkable production gains were achieved in 1969, 1970, 1975, 1977, and 1978. The range between lowest  and  highest  annual  growth  rates  was  even  greater  for  local  production. Most of the growth from this sector occurred at the county, commune, and production brigade mines.

In China the relationship between producers and consumers was made especially difficult by the structure of production. In the USSR the Ministry of Coal was responsible for 99 per cent of total production, and in 1970 there were 842 mines  with  an  average  annual  output  of  514,000  tons  per  year. 7 However,  in China, while all of the output from the CMAs and LS mines was under plan, the

output from the commune and collectively run mines was not. It has been estimated that in 1952, 1.4 per cent of the national output came from the latter, but by 1978 this total was 15.4 per cent. In that year there were some 600 state operated mines and 20,000 non-state mines. It was difficult enough for the planners to know exactly how much was being produced by each of the 600 state mines. The  production  and  consumption  of  the  output  from  the  non-state  mines  was virtually beyond their control prior to the late 1970s.

The  task  of  coordinating  production  and  consumption  was  much  easier  in countries where coal was used by fewer industries. For example, in the US, fifty companies accounted for 65 per cent of the total coal production in 1976 (up from 45 per cent in 1950). 8 Some 154 operations under the jurisdiction of these fifty companies produced over one million tons. Fifty-seven were large mines which sold  coal  to  a  variety  of  consuming  industries,  while  the  other  mines  were controlled by coal-consuming industrial concerns: nineteen oil and gas refineries, nineteen thermal electric, seventeen steel, eleven other metal, eight chemical, and twenty-three other plants. 9

India' s  coal  industry  was  nationalized  and  consolidated  in  1973  through  the closure  or  merging  of  hundreds  of  small  mines.  Whereas  the  public  sector

accounted  for  about  11  per  cent  of  total  production  in  1954,  in  1975-76  it accounted for 100 per cent. 10 In 1971 there were nearly 800 collieries in operation with an average annual rate of total production of just over 90,000 tons, but over a third of these were producing less than 6,000 tons per year. After nationalization, through three major companies, the Ministry operated a total of about 300 mines each with an average annual output of approximately 240,000 tons. 11 The national  agency  directly  coordinated  the  requirements  of  the  main  consumers, that is, the steel plants, thermal plants, etc.

Only 17 per cent of China's production in 1978 was washed and processed, mostly using the relatively primitive jiggery method. 12 Of the output from Shanxi, the province with the largest production, only 5 per cent was washed. 13 This proportion was extremely low compared to that of other countries. Since the early 1960s generally at least half of the coal produced in the US, Canada, and Western Europe  was  washed.  Between  1953  and  1957  the  proportion  of  washed  coal in China almost doubled, but thereafter the increases were very small. Table 3.5

indicates that in some years the increase in washing capacity was less than 5 per cent of the annual increase in production capacity at the CMAs.

Severe  air  pollution  in  the  form  of  smoke  particulates,  carbon  dioxide,  and sulphur dioxide - all resulting almost entirely from the burning of coal, especially in the winter months - caused respiratory disease in both humans and livestock, and poisoned plant life. China' s share of global carbon dioxide emissions went from 1 per cent in 1950 to 8 per cent in 1978. By comparison, India' s went from 1 to 2 per cent, Japan' s from 2 to 5 per cent, the US' from 42 to 25 per cent, and the USSR's from 11 to 17 per cent. 14

Table 3.6 gives a breakdown of the coal types from 1952 to 1979. The data for 1952 and 1957 is problematic due to problems with definitions. However, in the late  1960s  and  1970s  there  was  a  measurable  increase  in  the  proportion  of anthracite produced while the shares of both rich and gas coals used for coking fell. Whereas in most sectors of the economy the trend was toward modernization, the  proportion  of  coke  produced  in  the  inefficient  and  highly  polluting  smallscale ovens increased sharply from 1.9 per cent in 1949 to 30.3 per cent in 1978. 15

China's highest quality coal, that is high in calorific value but low in sulphur and ash levels, is found in the 'three wests' - Shanxi, Shaanxi and xi Nei Mengu. ( xi means west) (see Figure 1.1). Coal from other areas produces far less heat and is considerably more polluting. In 1952 the largest concentration of coal production  was  in  Liaoning  (17.7  per  cent),  followed  by  Shanxi  (16.3  per  cent),  and Hebei (15.2 per cent). Together the north and northeast regions produced almost 70 per cent of total output, 36 per cent in the north and 33.2 per cent in the northeast. Tables 3.7 and 3.8 give the provincial and regional distribution of production and  consumption,  respectively. Table  3.9  shows  that  the  north  region  had  the highest surplus (the amount in excess of local demand) followed by the northeast, while the eastern region had the most serious deficit.

It must be pointed out that the central authorities divided the country into three zones: heated, transition, and non-heated. Consumption was much higher in all the provinces and autonomous regions north of the Changjiang because they were allocated coal in the winter for heating, whereas those to the south were not. It was a government-decreed line of demarcation which caused people living in the middle transition zone, for example, in Shanghai, to suffer greatly in the winter for lack of the quantities of fuel for heating that they would have desired.

In  1952  Shanghai  alone  accounted  for  almost  one-fifth  of  the  nation' s  consumption. The eastern region as a whole accounted for 36.3 per cent, with Jiangsu and  Shandong  also  accounting  for  sizable  proportions.  The  second  largest concentration  of  consumption  was  Liaoning. The  northeast  region  as  a  whole accounted  for  29  per  cent,  the  north  for  14.2  per  cent,  the  southcentral  for 12 per cent, the southwest for 6.1 per cent, and the northwest for 2.4 per cent.

By 1965 Shanxi had become the largest producer (16.9 per cent of total), and Hebei and Liaoning each accounted for about 11 per cent. The north region as a  whole still  led  the  country  but  continued  to  lose  its  margin  due  to  efforts  to increase production in the northwest, southcentral, and southwest regions. The concentration of consumption in the northeast in 1965 was much less than it had been in 1952. The share of consumption in the east decreased slightly, but the size of the deficit in that region was reduced considerably. The consumption shares in the north, northwest, southcentral, and southwest increased.

Due  to  the  Third  Front  Development  Programme  (see  Chapter  2),  between 1965 and 1970 the shares of total consumption increased in the southcentral, and southwestern regions and stayed about the same or decreased everywhere else. The shares of production in the east and northeast remained about the same, but fell drastically in the north and increased in each of the northwest, southcentral, and southwest regions.

On the eve of the reform era the ten largest mines in terms of total annual output in descending order were Datong (Shanxi), Kailuan (Hebei), Pingdingshan (Henan),  Fuxin  (Liaoning),  Huaibei  (Anhui),  Jixi  (Heilongjiang),  Xuzhou (Jiangsu), Hegang (Heilongjiang), Fengfeng (Hebei), and Yangquan (Shanxi). 16 The  northwest,  northeast,  and  east  regions  were  all  consuming  more  than  in 1970, but the proportions were still highest in Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Shandong. The east region as a whole continued to account for about 35 per cent of total consumption. The concentrations in the north and northeast had begun to give  way  to  the  southcentral,  northwest,  and  southwest  regions.  However,  the common slogan bei mei nan yun , or transporting north coal to the south, was still apropos.

## Mechanization levels

It is difficult to make accurate international comparisons of levels of mechanization because mining conditions around the world are very different. Even within one country, while it is possible for some mines to have almost completely mechanized operations, for geological reasons others must be more labour intensive. However,  even  taking  this  into  account,  the  level  of  mechanization  in  China' s mines was indisputably very low.

In  1957  only  4.1  per  cent  of  the  CMAs  had  some  mechanization.  As  late as 1978 much of the extraction was still done manually using dynamite, picks, and  pneumatic  drills  to  dislodge  the  coal,  and  shovels  to  load  it  into  wheeled carts.  Some  32.8  per  cent  of  the  CMAs  had  partial  mechanization,  that  is, only  extraction  and  tunnelling  were  mechanized,  and  4.3  per  cent  had  full mechanization.  Mechanization  was  highest  in  those  provinces  where  pre-1949 foreign  involvement  had  been  greatest:  79.62  per  cent  at  Jixi  (Heilongjiang), 62.0 per cent at Y angquan (Shanxi), 49.4 at Datong (Shanxi), and 47.0 per cent at  Kailuan  (Hebei). 17 In  the  USSR  the  overall  level  of  mechanization  was 94.9 per cent in 1970, though there were a few areas where much of the work was still done manually. 18 In India the overall level of mechanization in 1969 was 16.3 per cent. 19

Representatives of foreign companies who visited Chinese mines in the 1970s noted  that  the  wide  variety  of  equipment  and  varying  degrees  of  labour/ mechanization substitution complicated the successful introduction of compatible new equipment. As for opencast technology, the Chinese had not yet employed large excavators, trucks and haulers, and conveyor systems. 20

More fully mechanized faces would have greatly increased yields. The average face output at fully mechanized large state mines was 33,607 tons per month in

1980,  but  only  12,186  at  the  semi-mechanized,  and  only  9,287  at  the  nonmechanized. 21 Hydraulic machinery was introduced in China by the Soviets in 1958, though its use never became widespread. 22 In 1980 only 1.9 per cent of all state mines had it and the average face output at these mines was 20,753 tons.

There were very few machinery factories that produced equipment solely for coal mining. Most did not belong to the Ministry, but rather to the Ministry of Machine Building and were old converted military engineering shops. In 1950 there were three coal machinery plants in operation, thirteen by 1965, and thirtyfour by 1979, at which time the technical level of the machinery was comparable to that in the US between 1909 and 1912, and in the Soviet Union between 1953 and 1955. 23

The  policy  of  maintaining  low  coal  prices  meant  that  the  industry  was incapable of making sufficient profits to upgrade machinery. Low planned rates of depreciation on fixed assets, that is, prolonged use of equipment, also a practice adopted from the Soviet system, exacerbated the situation. Depreciation in China's coal industry ranged annually between 2 and 3 per cent of total costs. By contrast, the rate at which equipment was retired in the US was 3.7 per cent. 24 On the revenue account of British Coal in 1985-86, depreciation accounted for 7.6 per cent of all expenditure. 25

Prolonged use of capital stock in China' s mines meant that it continually had to be repaired, and each repair became more costly and time-consuming. In 1981 only 61 per cent of all the mechanical equipment owned by the Ministry was in operation, 84 per cent of this functional equipment being classified as in good order. 26 This is comparable to the situation in the Soviet Union where it was estimated that one-tenth of the industrial labour force in the late 1970s, and one-third of  the  machine  tool  park  were  absorbed  in  repair  activity. 27 Visitors  from  the National Coal Board in 1956 to Soviet coal mine workshops observed: 'Judged by the amount of equipment lying about on the shop floor, the work in progress must be exceedingly great, but this does not necessarily mean a high throughput.' 28

The Chinese mining operations also experienced unreliability of machine and equipment delivery, delivery of incomplete sets, lack of spare parts, incompatibility, and continual breakage due to the use of low-grade steel, all typical problems in the Soviet coal and oil industries. 29 In a large proportion of the mines there was insufficient elevation equipment relative to the rate at which coal was being cut, creating an imbalance in workflow. 30 British visitors to Soviet mines in 1957 noted: 'Far less conveying of coal is done in the USSR than in this country and the development of conveyors is not as advanced as it is here', and 'Of the current stoppages of work at the coalface, some 25 per cent of time lost is said to be attributable to inadequate haulage facilities.' 31

Another factor reducing the return on capital investment was excessive standardization.  In  a  misguided  effort  to  economize  through  mass  production,  the Soviet planners, not appreciating that each mine had its own particular geological conditions, developed a standard set of blueprints for every phase of mine construction and for each piece of equipment. Often the wrong types of machinery were used.

## Resource use efficiency

Imbalanced output-capacity ratios, that is, insufficient preparatory work at the mine or oil site relative to the rate of exploitation, was one of the most serious shortcomings of command economies' energy management. The combination of the lack of sufficient investment with the use of gross output targets as the sole success  criterion  encouraged  large  production  increases  in  the  short  run,  but did not guarantee steady long-term production, development or full recovery at each site.

The locating and preparing of reserves must be ongoing and, depending on the site, position, and formation of the deposits, the required amount of capital, labour, and preparation time can vary considerably from year to year. Energy planners must balance the projected demand for energy with the amount of these inputs available to bring the resources into productive capacity.

In the early 1950s the Soviet mining engineers devised a carefully considered development programme for China's coal industry. From experience in their own country they understood that about half a ton should be produced for every ton of prepared capacity, that is, an output-capacity ratio of 0.5 : 1 should be maintained. This ratio had not been maintained in the USSR, and a calamity was unfolding at precisely that time in the Soviet coal industry. There was continual discussion of the problem in the Soviet press. 32 The demand for coal had been seriously underestimated and the miners were being ordered to produce more irrespective of the need to create capacity. The First Deputy Minister of the Soviet Coal Industry wrote in Pravda in 1953: 'Above all, a serious lag in carrying out the preparatory work  plan  must  be  eliminated. A  number  of  coal  combines â¦ have  constantly failed to carry out plans for mine excavations â¦ Capital construction is lagging seriously.' 33 The  following  year  it  was  reported:  'New  mines  are  opened  far behind schedule and often with major items unfinished, which delays the development of coal mining. The Ministry of Coal Industry still has not achieved a significant shortening of construction time â¦' 34 As late as the 1970s almost all of the new mines that were to start operations in the Donets field were 'well behind schedule' and there were also major delays in bringing on new capacity in the Kuznets Basin. 35

It is significant that the output-capacity ratio for China' s state mines was consistently low throughout the First Five Y ear Plan period (see Table 3.10). 36 The Soviet advisers, aware of the serious situation in their home country, counselled steady production growth based on prudent output-capacity ratios. However, as in the USSR, production in China was not nearly keeping pace with demand, but Mao ignored Soviet advice and called repeatedly for higher production targets at the CMAs. Then, in 1958, as part of the GLF, he launched the backyard furnace campaign in which peasants all over the country were to dig coal in an effort to match Britain' s steel production.

The  result  was  an  output-capacity  ratio  in  1958  of  4.3 : 1.  The  increase  in production in 1958 was almost seven times than in 1957, while the increase in capacity was not even two times greater. In 1961 and 1962 due to the exhaustion of the

miners, there was negative growth in production and minimal growth in capacity. Between 1963 and 1966 the total increase in production was about 90 per cent of the total increase in capacity. The most harmful year of the Cultural Revolution for  the  coal  industry,  1967,  saw  negative  growth  in  production  and  almost  no growth in capacity. In 1969, however, the production increase was about six times greater than the capacity increase. Between 1970 and 1976 the total increase in production was 60 per cent greater than the increase in capacity, and in 1977-78, 430 per cent greater. This represents a severe imbalance, and the sizable swings in production and preparation work, and lack of correlation between them, made for less efficiency in the use of labour and capital resources.

The chronic lack of capacity was also related to the fact that mine construction work was frequently prolonged. To build a large mine in the West took about five

years, but typically at least seven years in China. 37 The main cause for the delays was  the  allocation  of  insufficient  funds  and  materials  up  front  -  some  mine construction projects were given enough funding and materials to provide only partial ventilation and very basic water and electricity supplies - and there was the characteristic lack of incentives to complete on time, and of penalties for time overruns. 38 Table 3.11 indicates that investment per ton of new capacity rose very sharply in the 1970s, by over 25 yuan per ton at mines producing 30,000 and 45,000 tons per year, and by over 50 yuan per ton at mines producing 90,000 tons per year. By 1978 the output-capacity ratio was so out of balance that many workers had to stop cutting and devote all their time to mine preparation.

## Use of materials and labour efficiency

Table 3.12 shows that on average the use of timber in the mines between 1952 and  1979  decreased  while  the  consumption  of  explosives  and  electric  power increased. The consumption of timber would probably have increased had there not been shortages which forced the substitution of cement.

Compared to other countries in 1979, China used a relatively high amount of timber, far more explosives, and large quantities of electricity. The great range in consumption  of  the  materials  is  mainly  a  function  of  the  different  geological conditions. The generally easier mining conditions in the US were such that very

little  timber,  explosives,  and  electricity  were  required,  unlike  in  the  Lorraine Basin  of  France,  for  example,  where  the  great  depth  of  the  mines  and  a  high inflow of water necessitated a particularly large consumption of electricity.

The components of the 1978 production costs nationally and for two provinces and one region are given in Table 3.13. It is obvious that the conditions were much more favourable in the northern regions, and hence the materials used cost far less than in the southern and central regions. In all cases, timber, accounting for 31-38 per cent, and wages, accounting for 25-33 per cent, were the largest components of total costs. For comparison, labour costs as a proportion of total costs at underground mines accounted for 50 per cent in the US in the late 1970s, 14 per cent in South Africa, 45 per cent in Australia, and 51 per cent in the UK. 39

Employment in China's state mines increased by a total of 676 per cent between 1952 and 1978, at an average annual rate of about 13 per cent, though the increase was not steady as can be seen in Table 3.14. There was a 241 per cent increase at the  time  of  the  GLF ,  but  as  soon  as  this  explosive  growth  campaign  was  over many peasants necessarily returned to food production. In 1970, about four years into the Cultural Revolution, there was another large increase because coal shortages were acute.

International comparisons of productivity are also complicated by geological factors. Notwithstanding, it is safe to say that with the exception of a few of the CMAs, labour productivity was still very low in 1978. The average productivity of face workers increased from 2.341 tons in 1952 to 3.698 in 1978, and average monthly production per face from 4.331 tons to 10,989 tons. 40 However, output per manshift (OMS) in the 1970s was a fraction of what it was in the other large coal-producing countries (see Table 3.15), rising from an average of 0.356 tons in 1949, to 0.661 in 1952, and 0.931 in 1978.

In Shanxi Province, the most developed mining area, the OMS was 43 per cent higher  than  the  national  average  in  1979,  and  73  per  cent  higher  than  in  the southern  provinces. 41 Doyle  points  out  that  the  OMS  in  China  was  calculated according to the number of 'raw coal production workers', whereas when making comparisons with other countries 'personnel in industrial production' would be more appropriate. If this wider definition is used, assuming there are 300 shifts per year, the OMS in China would have been only about half of what the Chinese reported it to be. 42

The authorities  invariably  equated  more  labour  with  higher  production. The Ministry  believed  that  extra  workers  could  substitute  for  a  lack  of  machinery,

albeit machinery that was prone to breaking down. When a group from Britain' s National Coal Board visited some Chinese mines in 1976 they reported:

The  detailed  figures  given  at  the  individual  mines  clearly  indicated  what in the west would be regarded as substantial over-manning of the pits. In fact the concepts of productivity, in terms of output per manshift, and of manpower saving, so far play little part in the coal industry' s affairs. 43

In April 1977 it was decided at a national meeting to 'recruit 100,000 miners to the productive front, so that the MCI might cast off the stigma of always making deficits and begin to make profits'. 44 As the overall level of mechanization was increased,  it  should  have  been  possible  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  work  force. Rather,  capital  equipment  and  labour  were  simultaneously  introduced  into  the industry with little consideration of how to obtain the highest productivity from each, nor how they should complement one another.

International  coal  mining  employment  figures  are  not  always  disaggregated into production workers, administration, etc., and the proportions are likely different in each location. However, they can be used to make rough comparisons of labour productivity. In China the total number of employees in the CMAs alone was 1,172,484 in 1979, and their output was 357.77 million tons, meaning that 32.8 men were employed to cut 10,000 tons. For comparison the figures for US coal mines in 1977 were 236,000, 872.4, and 2.7; for the USSR in 1978, 1,035,000, 701.3, and 14.8; and for India in 1978, 660,000, 105.2, and 62.7. 45

The incremental labour output ratio (ILOR), given in Table 3.16, shows the variation in numbers employed at the state mines per unit increase in output. Over the First Five Y ear Plan period there was some semblance of balance, but after the GLF this was lost and took several years to be restored. In the early 1970s there were  again  large  increases  in  labour  relative  to  output.  It  is  very  likely  that the  changes  in  numbers  employed  had  lagged  effects,  but  it  is  not  possible  to make conclusive statements with the limited data available.

According to the general labour productivity index, calculated by dividing the total gross value of industrial output of an industry by the number of its employees, the performance of the coal industry in China declined between 1957 and 1965, reflecting overmanning and low prices though improved somewhat by 1978 (see Table 3.17). For all industries taken together, however, and for the power, petroleum,  chemical,  machine  building,  building  materials,  and  textiles  industries, the index showed great improvement.

Up to a third of the miners were peasants hired on a temporary basis, and the majority were illiterate and had no training of any kind. 46 The industry did not possess  much  expertise  in  1949  because  hitherto  production  had  been  almost completely  managed  by  the  Japanese,  Russians,  Germans,  and  British.  The Japanese, for security reasons, actually prohibited the Chinese from assuming any managerial  positions  with  the  result  that  after  the  Japanese  surrender,  mining experts from Japan had to be called upon to assist in the mines.

In 1957 it was reported that some collieries had no engineers at all and that often the managers and deputy managers had an education level of senior primary school or lower. 47 During the 1950s the Russians offered considerable training, but  because  conditions  were  initially  so  backward,  the  Chinese  were  only  just beginning to put into practice what they had been taught when the Soviet advisers returned home in 1960. Several projects were left uncompleted, and without the  necessary  blueprints  and  expertise,  the  Chinese  were  forced  to  improvise. Some projects were never completed.

The proportion of engineers and technicians in the coal mining workforce was 4.2 per cent in 1957. It fell to 2.7 in 1965 and by 1979 was only 1.3. 48 The number of engineers and technicians in machinery units went from 5.5 per cent in

1950 up to 9.8 in 1957, but down to 6.0 in 1965, and 4.5 in 1979. 49 The decline after 1965 was in large part due to the rustication of skilled people during the Cultural Revolution which affected all industries. The lack of trained personnel restricted the industry' s efforts to develop, operate, and maintain more sophisticated equipment.

Not only were there not enough skilled workers, but many of the employees with  some  training  were  inappropriately  deployed.  According  to  one  survey, 30,000 people in 1978 were not in posts that used their specializations. 50 This was also a problem in the Soviet Union. It was reported in Pravda in 1954: 'many engineers  and  technicians  are  spending  their  time  doing  work  of  secondary importance, in offices. In the Kuznets Basin, for example, only about 5 per cent of the engineers in the basin and only 2 per cent of the technicians are working as heads of mining sectors â¦' 51

As in all centrally planned economies remuneration in the production sectors in China was not linked to output. It was assumed that workers would, for the good  of  their  country,  offer  their  skills,  energy,  and  time  with  little  financial recognition. Instead of receiving monetary rewards for special achievements, they were given political honours and promotions. 52 However, as these rewards did not add to physical well-being, the result was that the employees attended their jobs but did as little as possible. In socialist countries life employment was guaranteed; no matter how low their productivity, workers were not dismissed.

Over the  thirty-year  period  coal  miners  went  from  among  the  lowest  to  the most highly paid industrial workers in China. 53 Besides the lack of correlation between output and wage, there was the fact that a mine' s total wage bill was calculated on the basis of the number of miners employed, regardless of the output. 54

Though a large proportion of the employees were temporary, the core labour force and  their  children  were  guaranteed  life-long  employment  irrespective  of  their productivity.

The difference between the eight ranks of workers was not large. Therefore, there  was  little  incentive  for  employees  to  strive  to  progress  from  the  first  to eighth, and progress through the ranks was not on the basis of merit but on years of service. While the coal industries of most Western countries have been distinguished by fierce union militancy, bitter strikes, and lockouts, this was not the case in China. The All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), including the coal industry unions, served as instruments of the Party and State to promote official goals. After the Cultural Revolution the role and mandate of the unions were unclear.

The rigidly hierarchical nature of the planning system did not facilitate communication between higher and lower levels within the Ministry. Many problems in coal production arose as a result of the fact that most of the planners in Beijing had  no  first-hand  experience  in  coal  mines,  apparently  the  same  situation  in the USSR. These comments by a director of a Soviet mine in 1954 epitomize the frustrations caused by the difficulties in communications:

â¦the  annual  plans  for  mining  work  are  checked  and  confirmed  only  in Moscow, by one of the Deputy Ministers â¦ There are thousands of mines in the country. About ten hours are needed really to get to know the plan of each mine. Consequently, in order to confirm all the plans, the Deputy Minister must  have  10,000  hours  time,  or  1,250  workdays.  There' s  astronomy  for you! â¦The Ministry plans our output scrupulously and in detail: right down to the last cutting face. Imagine what kind of work is involved in planning for each cutting face from thousands of kilometres away! And we plan production from below, so as to say. And if there is a discrepancy, correspondence goes both ways and we get all tied up; we try to clear it up and reach an agreement, and telegrams fly back and forth. This petty supervision by the ministry hinders us very much. 55

Safety standards were very low, especially at the commune mines, where there was no mechanical ventilation and open flame torches were used. Most of the accidents were caused by roof-falls or coal and gas explosions. In 1980, fatalities in Shanxi Province, where some of the most technically advanced mines were situated, occurred at the rate of 2.99 per million tons mined, while the rate in West Germany was only 0.87. 56 In 1982 the rate was 0.16 in the US, 0.96 in the USSR, 0.55 in Poland, 0.36 in the UK, and 1.36 in Japan. 57

## Financing

## Viability of the industry

International comparisons of investment in energy are problematic because different  countries  rely  on  different  kinds  of  energy  and  therefore  face  different

development problems. Even comparisons limited to the coal industry itself are open  to  questioning. The  amount  of  capital  devoted  to  mining  machinery  and washing equipment, for example, varies greatly with the location and geological complexity of the site, type of coal mined, type of mining, method of production, scale of operations, type and degree of technical sophistication of the equipment used in all procedures, and availability of labour.

Before  the  reform  and  opening  up  programme  in  the  late  1970s  and  1980s, meaningful conversions of the Chinese currency into a hard currency equivalent were problematic. After suitably weighting various factors, Munasinghe and Meier found that China' s investment in the energy sector as a whole, as a percentage of total public investment, was low compared to that of other developing countries (see Table 3.18). Unfortunately, data for an earlier time period was unavailable.

Inadequate funding for energy development has been characteristic of, though by  no  means  unique  to,  centrally  planned  economies.  Not  enough  investment went to energy relative to other sectors. Allocations were sporadic and, as many observers of the East Bloc and Soviet Union have noted, were persistently too low. These and the amount of reinvested profits - where there were any - were inadequate to maintain production, let alone to expand at the desired pace. 58 In both the Chinese and Soviet economies there was the lack of an appropriate value for capital.  In  market  economies  investment  programmes  in  the  public  sector  are normally evaluated on the basis of potential profits or cost benefit analysis.

Coal was a fundamental requirement for industrial development in many countries, at least until the 1970s, and national governments typically played a major role in financing coal production. Of the developed countries, the coal industry in Britain was completely nationalized in 1946, and though many of the operations in the US, Japan, and Germany were not in the public sector, there was considerable government financial assistance in the form of direct aid, price support, limitations on coal imports, and government-assured long-term agreements between producers and large consumers. 59 In most developing countries, including India, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Nigeria, Mozambique, Morocco, Turkey,

Greece, and Thailand, the state financed most of the production, while in only a few countries such as Zambia, Zaire, Swaziland, and Brazil, was much of the coal produced in the private sector with both domestic and foreign capital.

Coal industries in very few countries other than Australia, South Africa, and Colombia  made  large  profits.  Most  governments  were  subsidizing  their  coal industries  directly  or  indirectly.  In  1982  a  government  subsidy  equivalent  to US$17 was provided for every ton produced in Japan, US$19 in Germany, US$26 in Belgium, and US$9 in the UK. 60

Between 1953 and 1978 China's coal industry received a total of 349.47 billion yuan  in  state  investment  compared  to  252.49  billion  for  the  oil  industry,  and 457.73 billion for the electricity industry (see Table 3.19). There were large variations in the yearly allocations. After the Soviet technicians left in 1960, China failed  to  devise  a  long-term  balanced  investment  programme  for  the  industry. Investment  in  coal  production  as  a  proportion  of  total  investment  in  energy decreased from 51.9 per cent in 1953 to 34.2 per cent in 1957, and reached an alltime high of 57.2 per cent in 1961. Thereafter, the average percentage fell from about 40 per cent during the 1963-65 readjustment period to 28 per cent during the Fifth Five Y ear Plan period (see Table 3.20). Investment in coal as a proportion of total industrial investment was steadier averaging at 10.8 per cent for the entire period (see Table 3.21).

Part of the problem was that beginning in the mid-1960s the government hoped the country could reduce its reliance on coal, and tentatively began conversion to oil and electricity. Investment in the coal industry vis-Ã -vis oil and electricity was lowest in 1976, and coal made the lowest ever contribution, 69.9 per cent, to total energy consumption that year. However, as all easily exploitable sources of oil had been surveyed by then with no major new finds, it was realized there was no alternative but to return to depending on coal as the main fuel.

The  Third  Front  Development  Programme  (1964-71)  had  been  extremely damaging to the economy, perhaps even more so than the Cultural Revolution. 61 Between 1963 and 1965 it is estimated that 38.2 per cent of the national investment went to the Third Front, 52.7 per cent between 1966 and 1970 (Third Five Year Plan), and 41.1 per cent between 1971 and 1975 (Fourth Five Y ear Plan). 62 The proportions would be yet higher if only industrial investment were considered. The proportions of national investment allocated to the interior provinces of Sichuan and Guizhou tripled in 1965 and remained high until 1971. Looking at a  longer  period,  Naughton  found  that  between  1953  and  1975  there  was  more capital construction in Sichuan than in the coastal areas of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Jiangsu combined and the levels in Guizhou and Jiangsu were about on a par. 63 He estimates conservatively: 'if the money had been invested in non-Third Front interior  regions  (to  say  nothing  of  coastal  regions)  China' s  industrial  output  in 1979 would have been 44 billion yuan more than it was. To put it another way, China's annual industrial output is currently 10-15 per cent below what it would have been if the Third Front had never been undertaken â¦' 64

Table  3.22  gives  the  breakdown  by  source  of  investment  funds  for  capital construction. The central government provided over 90 per cent of the funding

during the 1950s and 1960s, though in the mid-1970s, the collectives contributed about an eighth of the total.

The incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) is a measure of capital productivity. It compares marginal capital input with marginal output. Table 3.16 gives the ratios for CMAs, that is, the variation in investment (in constant prices) per unit increase in output. The many years when there was a negative change in one or both  makes  it  difficult  to  draw  conclusions.  The  year  1972  is  notable  for  an increase in investment of over 23 per cent compared to an increase in CMA production of only about one per cent. Without question large investment injections had lagged effects, however, the unsteadiness of the allocations epitomizes the absense of long-term planning after the GLF.

Investment in the coal industry was high in 1977 and 1978 because by then it had  been  decided  that  conversion  to  oil  or  hydroelectricity  was  not  feasible. Considerable  investment  was  needed  immediately  to  increase  both  output  and capacity and this accounts for the very high ICORS in those years.

The  investment  allocations  were  greatly  influenced  by  'image' factors. The government regarded steel production as a measure of the country's economic stature and was wont to making frequent national and international proclamations about next year' s ever higher production. Officials at the various coal bureaux had to provide the necessary coal for coking as best they could. This situation was similar to that which Soviet industry experienced during the Stalin years.

In 1957 half of China' s major mines had deficits, and in 1977 the proportion had reached 73 per cent. 65 Table 3.23 shows that far from there being a steady increase in profits per ton, there were large fluctuations. The volatility in profits greatly affected production in that there was never enough capital available on a sustained basis to re-invest, and to increase the levels of mechanization, processing, and storage capacity. The industry never enjoyed a profit of greater than 4.60 yuan per ton, achieved in 1960, prior to the GLF collapse. According to the available data, there were a few successful years in the early 1970s, but the industry again lost ground in the mid-1970s. In 1974, 1976, and 1977 there was a loss on each ton produced.

The table suggests that there was no loss per ton in 1978. However, according to Y e Ruixiang, Deputy Head of the Department of Costing and Pricing of the Institute  of  Finance  and  Trade  Economics  at  the  Chinese  Academy  of  Social

Sciences, the cost of producing a ton in 1978 was 16.7 yuan and the producer price was 16.15 yuan. 66 After taxes there was a loss of 1.84 yuan per ton.

Table 3.24 shows that in 1978 the capital profit level of the industrial sector as a whole was 15.5 per cent while for the coal industry it was only 0.3 per cent, but 70.2 per cent for the oil industry. 67 Between 1952 and 1978 the output value of the coal industry grew relatively slowly compared to other industries, expanding from 100 in 1952 (base year index) to only 990.4 in 1978, whereas that of the oil

industry rose to 13,892.4, the chemical industry to 7,625.7, the machinery industry to 4,908.8, and the power industry to 3,493.4. 68

The low selling price of distributed coal was a major factor in the poor financial performance of the industry. Marxist pricing theory is briefly explained in Chapter 2. Raw materials were not to be sold for profit but at as low a price as possible. The prices did not fully reflect either the different quality characteristics of the coals nor the transport charges. During the first fifteen years of the PRC the  average 'producer' or 'supply' price per ton for coal from state mines was raised nominally to cover the differential in production costs across the country. One of the policies during the readjustment years was:

Strict adherence to the original price levels of eighteen categories of daily necessities accounting for 60 per cent of the spending of industrial and office workers, including grain, edible oils, cotton cloth, cotton textiles and knitwear, fuel coal, basic pharmaceuticals, housing, water and electricity. No fluctuation whatsoever was permitted in these categories. 69

Early on in the Cultural Revolution, in order to maintain price stability, the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council announced the Regulations  on  Further  Practising  Economy  in  Making  Revolution, Restricting the Purchasing Power of Collectives and Strengthening Control Over Funds, Supplies and Prices . As a result of the enforcement of these regulations there were few changes made to the prices of anything between 1965 and 1977.

From about 1972 the non-state mines were allowed to sell their coal at market prices. However, the prices of output from the state mines were tightly regulated. The  single  largest  increase  in  average  state  mine  producer  prices  occurred  in 1961, 27.7 per cent over the 1960 level. This increase was an attempt to ameliorate  the  financial  problems  of  the  industry  caused  by  the  GLF .  Over  the  same

period average production costs per ton ranged from a low of 8.76 yuan in 1959 to a high of 17.30 yuan in 1967, with an annual average of 13.8 yuan. They rose in the early 1970s as existing pits were deepened, more rock was encountered, wages and bonuses were increased, equipment wore out, the prices of other materials increased, and new mines were opened in the difficult terrain of the central and southern regions (see Chapter 2).

The low coal prices in the Soviet Union and East Bloc countries had had the same result as they did in China, that is, the industry' s costs were far greater than its  income  and  the  government  had  to  subsidize  it  heavily.  In  1967  the  Soviet Union's coal industry was in such poor financial shape that the government was forced to raise the price by 80 per cent, which was the largest price increase of all industrial categories, and again in 1982 by another 42 per cent. 70

A consequence of the low prices and profits in the coal industry, compared to those in the oil and electricity industries, was that the coal industry had less prestige and 'bureaucratic clout'. 71 Had the coal industry made large profits, perhaps it would have been given greater and more consistent attention in terms of planning. Here again is the image problem referred to above.

A major drain on the industry were pensions and other social welfare expenses. Such were the health hazards of working at the coal faces that the men could work only for about twelve years. The average retirement age of 45 years was far lower than for other industries. Also, as most of the mines were situated in remote areas, hospitals, schools, and even universities had to be built and maintained for the miners' families.

It was noted in Chapter 2 that on several occasions the plans were approved and changed after the beginning of the year in which they were meant to be applied. Although control figures were always available, there was an uncertainty about the operations until approved targets were set. Efficiency was affected as a result of  decisions  being  made  on  the  basis  of  incomplete  information. The  political convulsions were not the only cause of the frequent revision of targets. The combination of projected rapid growth in all sectors, the impossibility of assessing accurately the requirements of all consumers, and the fact that the planned stockpiles held by producers were small, made coordination a formidable, if not impossible task. Inevitably a miscalculation was made and some consumers were not allocated enough, or were completely overlooked. This meant that several iterations of the balances had to be made and coal targets altered. Late completion and implementation of plans and the continual revision of output targets were also problems of Soviet industry.

## Foreign involvement and trade

The Soviet Union had provided technical training to Chinese mine managers both in China and in the USSR, and helped to build mines and install equipment in China.  Considerable  assistance  was  also  received  from  Poland,  Romania,  East Germany, and Czechoslovakia. In the 1970s delegations from various Western countries were permitted to tour the best mines in China, and there were isolated

imports  of  Western  machinery,  but  no  large-scale  aid  or  loan  contracts  were signed.

As for trade, exporting coal was not a priority before 1979. The exports that did occur were mainly part of compensation trade deals with other communist countries,  especially North Korea. Between 1953 and 1978 they never amounted to more than 4 million tons per annum, or 2 per cent of total production. 72 Imports, mainly from Australia and North Korea, never exceeded 2.6 million tons.

## Transport

By 1936 some 20,740km of track had been laid in China, mostly in the northeast region, but after the war with Japan and the ongoing civil war from 1945 to 1949, only about 10,000 were serviceable. 73 Thus, one of the first tasks of the Communist government was to repair and consolidate the lines. While some built before 1911 became major trunk lines, the branch lines presented special problems. The foreign business interests had tended to work independently, constructing  their  own  lines  for  their  own  specific  purposes,  resulting  in  fragmented sub-systems complicated by different gauges. The amount of trackage inherited by the Communist government in 1949 was comparable to what the US had in 1854, and what Russia had in 1878. 74 India and Brazil both had higher railway densities in the early 1950s in terms of kilometres per thousand population and per thousand square kilometres.

As part of their loan package, the Soviets provided almost all rolling stock, which China could not yet produce. After the departure of the Soviet personnel in 1960, railway equipment and expertise were obtained on a barter basis from Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  and  various  non-Communist  countries.  From  1949  to 1979, the main source of capital investment was the central government, and to a lesser extent, the provincial governments.

Due to the 'closed door' policy, and the government' s failure to appreciate fully the key economic role of transportation, the total length of the railways in 1978 was relatively small at only 48,618 km (see Table 3.25), and the trackage densities  were  still  relatively  low  (see Table  3.26).  Notwithstanding,  apart  from  the Soviet Union, China had the highest railway freight intensity in the world. Traffic densities  of  over  25  million  ton-miles  per  route-mile  were  recorded  on  the Beijing-Shenyang (Liaoning) and Beijing-Wuhan (Hubei) lines, while in the US in 1972 there was an average of slightly over 3 million tons per route-mile. 75

Before 1979 China, compared to other countries, invested relatively little in the transportation  sector.  State  capital  construction  investment  allocations  were highly erratic (see Tables 3.19 and 3.21), constituting on average 15 per cent of national capital construction investment, which was less than half what it was in many other developing countries. 76

Investment in railways as a proportion of total capital construction investment averaged 10.8 per cent during the First Five Y ear Plan (1953-57), 8.8 during the Second (1958-62), 8.4 during the adjustment years of 1963-65, 12.3 during the Third (1966-70), 10.3 during the Fourth (1971-75), and only 6.3 during the Fifth

(1976-80). 77 The  high  investment  in  new  railways  in  the  Third  Front  region between 1964 and 1971 came at the expense of maintenance and expansion of the existing lines elsewhere. It was during this time that serious transportation bottlenecks began to hinder the modernization of the country as a whole. 78

The technology of the trains was generally several decades behind that in the West. In 1979, 40 per cent of all the steam locomotives had been running for forty years or longer. By that time most countries had long abandoned the use of steam locomotives, which are much less efficient in terms of the amount they can haul per  unit  of  energy  used,  their  ability  to  function  on  steep  gradients,  and  their manoeuvrability in the yards. In China at this time, 80.6 per cent of the locomotives were powered by steam, 18.6 per cent by diesel, and only 0.8 per cent by electricity. The first electrification of a line did not occur until 1962, and by 1978 only  1,030 km,  or  2.1  per  cent  of  the  total  trackage  was  electrified.  Only 15.7 per cent of the total operating railways was double-tracked by 1978, and only 12.3 per cent had automatic blocking. 79

The wooden freight cars, which in 1980 were small by international standards, averaging only 50 tons capacity, were comparable to what had been used in the US in the 1940s. The average freight train in China hauled 2,500 tons in 48-53 cars loaded at full capacity, while in the US 4,500 tons were hauled in 68 cars loaded at only 85 per cent capacity. 80 India had over twice the number of both freight and passenger cars, and 8 per cent more locomotives than China in 1980. 81 Coal  used  a  large  proportion  of  railway  capacity  in  terms  both  of  weight  and volume. On average the daily percentage of freight cars devoted to coal was 31.7 in 1952, 46.6 in 1962, and 34.7 in 1978. 82 In Shanxi Province coal occupied an average of 87 per cent of the railway capacity between 1976 and 1981. 83

The yearly  increases  in  coal  production  were  no  where  near  being  matched with  similar  increases  in  railway  capacity.  The  negative  effects  for  the  coal industry of insufficient investment in the railways were compounded by lack of

communication between the Ministries of Coal and Railways. Railway infrastructure  plans  were  set  by  the  SPC.  Even  if  communications  between  the  two Ministries had been good, it was not within the power of the Ministry officials to make substantial, unilateral alterations to the infrastructure allocations and development plans. The management of inter-industry linkages and coordination of infrastructure  development were especially poor in central planning. Decisionmakers in Beijing were not fully aware of the extent that transport conditions were determining production ( yi yun ding chan ).

Nationally, total coal output increased over nineteen times between 1952 and 1978,  but  the  railway  network,  in  terms  of  total  length  of  operating  rail  line, increased only 1.1 times, the number of locomotive engines only 1.35 times, and the number of freight cars only three times. 84 Compared to the US, the USSR, and India, growth in freight train capacity in China lagged the production growth rate of several key commodities, including coal. While China' s coal production index was 5.6 in 1978, the railway transportation index was only 5.0. The same indices for the US in 1955 were respectively 0.9 and 1.1; 4.2 and 4.9 for the USSR in 1975; and 1.8 and 2.2 for India in 1978. 85

Used far beyond its intended capacity, the equipment was constantly breaking down. In 1979 it was found that some 29 per cent of the freight cars sent to seventytwo surveyed mines were defective, having holes and missing doors, panels, and locks. 86 The Ministry had to spend 50 million yuan each year mending them. It was estimated that the loss rate in railway shipments was 3-5 per cent, meaning that over 40 million tons of coal were lost in the yards or along the tracks in 1979 and 1980. The loss rate in waterway shipment varied from 3.85 to 12.15 per cent, with the result that about 4 million tons were lost over the same period. Due to leaking barges and  faulty  unloading  equipment,  well  over  10,000  tons  of  coal  each  year  were falling into the river at Shanghai alone. There was also a shortage of warehouses and mechanized loading and unloading equipment both at the railway stations and ports. In the winter, delays were caused by the coal freezing in and onto the cars.

While the industrial centres in the east and south suffered critical shortages, each year enormous piles of coal accumulated at the railway stations in the north, and even at the mine heads, because there was insufficient wagon capacity. In 1980 it was estimated that there were 20 million tons stockpiled throughout the country, half of which were in Shanxi Province alone. Calorific value was lost due to weathering - when not properly stored, bituminous coal can lose up to one-fifth of its heating value and lignite can deteriorate beyond use. Some coal was lost entirely  through  spontaneous combustion or was washed away by rain. Shanxi alone was losing up to 300,000 tons each year due to exposure to spontaneous combustion and rain. 87 Another problem was pilfering of the coal when loaded wagons sat in station yards. Railway workers and peasants living near the station would help themselves. 88

Although water transport of heavy cargo had been used for centuries, in the late 1970s it accounted for less than 10 per cent of total coal transport. China has over 3,000 miles of coastline, and in 1978 there were some 136,000 km of navigable inland waterways, but only 42 per cent of these were at least 1 m in depth. 89 Most

of the short hauls made by train would have been handled much more efficiently by  truck  had  such  vehicles  been  available. 90 Not  only  were  there  not  nearly enough trucks being manufactured, there was never sufficient supplies of petrol to operate them. The vehicles were small by international comparison and often loaded and unloaded manually.

When bottlenecks  on  the  main  trunk  railways  became  so  severe  that  it  was decided to try to transport more coal south down the coast in ships, it became apparent immediately that the loading and unloading capacities of the main harbours in the north and south were mismatched. The southern ports were capable of unloading cargo from much larger ships than the northern ports were capable of loading.

Planners in Beijing organized the transport for all the coal produced by the state mines. The number of linkages was so large that inevitably shipments were frequently late,  made  via  round-about  routes,  and  were  often  duplicated. 91 For example, at one site all that was needed to transfer the coal from the mine to the nearby thermal plant was a conveyor belt, but the coal was put on a railway that first went 16 km to the east before going by the power plant. 92 In another case, the closest washing plant was 1,188 km away, and the locomotives consumed unnecessarily several extra tons of coal in hauling heavy waste materials with the coal. In 1957, Shanghai' s coal requirements were shipped in from thirty-two coal mines, some of which were over 3,000 km away. 93 Inefficient  use  of  railway  capacity seems to have been common in many centrally planned economies. In Poland it was estimated that one out of every five railway cars travelled unnecessarily, and in the Soviet Union, misuse of capacity was said to comprise 5-8 per cent of all transportation. 94

The problems in planning the size and timing of deliveries affected not only coal shipments, but all commodities, as observed by two Chinese economists:

â¦poor distribution, planning and management means goods are sent one way along a transport route today, then back along the same route tomorrow, or by railways in one direction and back by water; sometimes goods which are available locally are brought from distant areas; some goods are re-shipped several  times;  and  sometimes  goods  ideally  suited  to  boat  transport  are instead shipped by rail, or goods which ought to be transported by truck are put onto boats. 95

A well-documented consequence of inadequate transportation capacity relative to production in command economies was widespread hoarding, which became a major contributing factor to shortages of all goods, including coal. 96 The shortages of coal in China were such that it was continually bartered and, indeed, coal itself became a form of currency. In frustration with the inability to communicate with each other and the amount of time wasted in making requests through the proper channels, consuming operations and enterprises habitually requested and stocked larger amounts of all supplies than they required in order to hedge against future supply problems, and there was no enforced penalty. Holding large stocks

of  coal  created  severe  and  self-perpetuating  imbalances  in  the  productiondistribution-consumption cycle. As time went on the planners in Beijing became less able to ascertain accurately which consumers had legitimate needs for coal and which were hoarding extra supplies.

While some enterprises had large unreported stockpiles and railway storage yards were  filled  to  capacity,  others  continually  had  urgent  need  of  more. 97 This  is exactly the situation Kornai identified in the East European economies: 'â¦ shortage and slack are simultaneously present in a resource-constrained economy â¦ the hoarding tendency and, together with this, the almost insatiable demand for inputs  for  current  production  represent  one  of  the  fundamental  processes  that 'siphon off' external slack (in this case the seller' s output stock) from the economy. In this way they intensively promote permanent reproduction of the shortage in the economy.' 98 Speaking of supply problems in general, one Chinese economist observed:

Because of the administrative means of managing resources, some departmental comrades are accustomed to devoting their energy towards 'fighting' over  resources,  with  the  result  that  the  more  the  'fighting',  the  worse  the shortages, and the worse the disputes. Over the past thirty years, the management of materials has been changed several times, but the problems with the  centralized  administrative  way  of  managing  materials  have  not  been solved. 99

Wan Jing, another economist, noted that the only restriction on hoarding was the inconvenience of providing storage. 100 In China, the fact that not all of the coal produced came under plan added to the confusion. Coal sold on the black market frequently occupied space allocated to other consumers. 101 Transport problems were not unique to China. Much of the railway stock in Russia was old and in poor condition, and the shortage of railway cars was given as one of the official reasons why production in the USSR fell in 1978. 102 Describing the situation in India in 1975, one writer observed: 'It is difficult to think of any sector or aspect of  the  economy  of  India  in  which  an  improvement  in  performance  is  more urgently needed.' 103

## Consumption

## Consumption and economic growth

In 1978, 30 per cent of the industrial productive capacity could not function due to  a  lack  of  sufficient  energy.  This  is  estimated  to  have  caused  a  loss  of  over 100 billion yuan, or 22 per cent of gross value of industrial and agricultural output for that year. 104 Most urban areas were put on fixed electricity use schedules, and in order to share the available electricity each sector of the economy was ordered to work without heat and light for one or two separate days, or for three or four consecutive days per week.

In 1979 some 37 per cent of the rural villages still had no electricity at all and had no option but to continue, as for centuries before, to gather whatever burnable material they could find for cooking and heating purposes. 105 Most of the crop residues and dung which ought to have been left on the soil to maintain its nutrients  and  prevent  erosion  were  used  as  fuel. 106 The  amount  of  land  lost through erosion increased from 1.16 million square kilometres in the early 1950s to 1.5 million in the early 1980s.

One standard technique used to measure the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is to calculate the energy consumption elasticity coefficient  by  dividing  the  energy  consumption  growth  rate  for  any  particular year by the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate. 107

A high coefficient is typical of developing countries because, as modernization progresses, the energy consumption rate is usually higher than the growth rate of the economy as a whole, due to the fact that the construction of new industries, infrastructure, commercial development, housing, etc., requires considerable amounts of  energy.  Furthermore,  developing  countries  tend  to  have  only  small  amounts of  energy-efficient  equipment  and  many  fewer  management  staff  trained  in  the efficient use of energy, if any at all.

Conversely, the energy consumption growth rate in developed countries is generally less than the growth rate of the economy, and hence the coefficient is low. The industrial infrastructure is largely in place, economic activity is usually more consumer- and service-oriented, and more energy-efficient equipment is in use. Per capita energy consumption is high, the annual increases are small, and any extra consumption is by choice, not necessity.

It is difficult to make meaningful international comparisons of energy elasticity and intensity data. For example, when calculating the elasticity coefficient, the consumption of non-commercial fuels is generally excluded, and this exclusion can distort the true energy picture in developing countries where these fuels are the mainstay in rural areas. There are many factors which affect elasticity coefficient data, and many of these are difficult to quantify: climate; prices of domestic and foreign energy; efficiency of energy-consuming equipment; industrial productivity levels; culture; planned economic growth rates; relative availability, ease of distribution, and quality of the various types of energy resources; structure of income, population, and industry; living standards; etc.

Changes  in  incomes  and  energy  prices  are  generally  considered  to  be  the most significant factors influencing energy consumption. In market economies, consumers are quickly appraised of changes in energy prices, however small or infrequent, and respond immediately, but in centrally planned economies prices and exchange rates were set by state planners and normally altered infrequently.

Between 1971-73 and 1974-77 the energy elasticity coefficients of most countries decreased. In other words, each one per cent increase in GDP required less energy in 1974-77 than in 1971-73. There were two factors at play: first, the decrease in the growth of energy consumption accompanying economic maturity, and  second,  the  sudden  effects  of  the  oil  shock  in  1973  when  cutbacks  in  oil production and shipment embargoes were used as an economic weapon in the

Arab-Israeli  conflict.  The  price  of  oil  more  than  quadrupled,  causing  frantic efforts  in  every  importing  country  to  reduce  energy  consumption  and  improve consumption efficiency. Some countries managed to reduce the amount of energy consumed per unit of GDP by over half. For others it was impossible to change the structure of their economies and/or fuel mix, or readily improve the efficiency of their equipment.

Table 3.27 shows the tremendous range of China's elasticity coefficients for each of total energy, electricity, and coal consumption between 1954 and 1978. These figures reflect the extreme fluctuations over those years in the growth rates of  GDP  and  energy  consumption,  which  resulted  primarily  from  the  political upheavals. As China had not been importing oil and had virtually no trade with countries that did, the effects of the oil crisis were not felt. In fact, isolation meant

that China' s consumption efficiency worsened with time and the authorities were hardly  aware  of  it.  Whereas  the  average  annual  energy  conservation  rate  in some major developed countries in the years immediately after 1973 was above 1.38 per cent, in China it was -2.85. 108

Between 1954 and 1978 the average yearly increase in GDP was 6.32 per cent and the average yearly increases in energy, electricity, and coal consumption were 11.67, 15.41, and 10.56 per cent, respectively, resulting in overall energy elasticity coefficients of 1.85, 2.44, and 1.67. 109 In other words, each 1 per cent increase in GDP required a  1.85,  2.44,  and  1.67  per  cent  increase  respectively  in  energy, electricity, or coal consumption.

The average yearly coal consumption growth rate was very high at the time of the GLF. In 1958, 1959, and 1960 it grew at 87.1, 36.0, and 25.1 per cent, respectively, but in 1961, 1962, and 1963, the 'bitter years' following the GLF, it fell to -34.3, -20.7, and -6.2 per cent. GDP growth rate over these six years was 21.3, 8.8, -0.3, -27.3, -5.6, and 10.2 per cent, respectively. The worst elasticity coefficients  were  for  the  year  1959:  4.09  per  cent  for  total  energy  and  coal consumption, and 6.11 for electricity consumption.

During  'the  adjustment  years',  1963-65,  the  average  annual  growth  rate  of coal  consumption  was  only  3.7  per  cent,  but  that  of  GDP  in  constant  terms, 15.2 per cent, with a resulting very low elasticity coefficient of 0.24. This reflects the government's change from emphasizing heavy industry to light industry and agriculture. During the chaotic years of the Cultural Revolution, 1966-76, coal consumption grew at an annual average rate of 7.2 per cent, while GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.9 per cent, with a resulting coefficient of 1.22. There were two years of negative growth in GDP: 1967 and 1968 during the early years of the Cultural Revolution, and 1976 at the end. However, in 1970 there was an extraordinary 19.4 per cent surge in growth, the highest ever recorded in China' s history after the GLF, reflecting a degree of recovery after the worst years of the Cultural Revolution.

Generally  speaking,  industry  grew  at  a  higher  rate  than  the  economy  as  a whole. Looking at the very high figures it is difficult to believe there were energy shortages.  However,  this  enviable  growth  took  place  largely  at  the  expense  of civilian comfort and convenience. The affects of the GLF and Cultural Revolution on this sector were much greater than economywide growth.

Another method for examining the relationship between coal consumption and economic  growth  is  to  calculate  the  comprehensive  coal  consumption  ratio, derived by dividing total coal consumption by total GDP . Table 3.28 shows that coal consumption per 10,000 yuan of GDP more than doubled over the period. The effects of the GLF are very evident.

The overall  picture  from  these  indicators  is  that  the  efficiency  of  coal  consumption worsened sharply in the early years of the GLF, recovered slightly, then almost steadily deteriorated after the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.

By international standards China' s energy consumption was very inefficient. 110 In 1978  China  consumed  24.62  million  tons  of  standard  fuel  per  every

$US10,000 (at 1970 prices) of GNP , while each of the US, the USSR, and UK consumed just under half that amount, at respectively 11.99, 11.29, and 11.88 million tons. Japan consumed less than one-third at 7.07; France about a quarter at 6.10; and West Germany less than one quarter at 5.77. 111 In 1980 China produced just over US$470 of industrial output value per ton of energy consumed, very little relative to the US$1,000 in India; US$1,064 in the USSR; US$1,108 in the US; US$2,334 in the FRG; and US$2,548 in Japan. 112

Compared to the rest of the world the consumption of electricity, which was generated  mostly  from  coal-fed  thermal  plants,  was  also  highly  inefficient.  In

1978 consumption at 1.83 kWh per US$90 was second highest in the world after Bulgaria' s 1.99 kWh, and four times the world average of 0.45 kWh. 113 The next highest  were  1.73  in  Zambia  and  1.65  in  Romania.  The  average  was  0.41  in Africa, 0.31 in Latin America, and 0.39 in Asia, of which it was 0.50 on Taiwan, 0.28  in  Hong  Kong,  and  0.53  in  India.  It  stood  at  1.43  in  the  USSR,  1.00  in non-OECD Europe, and 0.32 in OECD Europe.

According to one estimate, China's energy efficiency in the late 1970s compared to the average for the developed world was less than half in the industrial and private sectors, and about 83 per cent in the thermal electricity generation and transmission sector. 114 The general efficiency for the economy as a whole was about 61 per cent of the average for the developed world.

## Breakdown of coal consumption

In 1980 coal accounted for 43 per cent of the energy consumed in the agricultural sector, 45 per cent in construction, 50 per cent in transportation and communications,  66  per  cent  in  the  commerce  and  public  catering  sector,  15  per  cent  in non-productive activities, and 91 per cent in the residential sector. 115

Table  3.29  provides  a  breakdown  of  coal  consumption  from  1953  to  1978. In 1953 the productive: non-productive consumption ratio was 58 : 42. In other words, 58 per cent of the coal was devoted to industry, coke production, power generation, railways, and other industries, while 42 per cent was devoted to home and commercial heating and cooking. By 1978 the ratio had changed drastically to 82 : 18. The proportion of coal devoted to power generation more than doubled to 20 per cent, while that devoted to the railways halved. The proportion to other industries, which includes specific industries such as steel, synthetic ammonia, cement, and coal mining also rose sharply from 30 to 47 per cent.

Obviously, it was the priority of the government that as much of the country' s energy resources as possible be allocated to industry. The amount allocated to the civilian sector was minimal, and did not reflect at all what Chinese citizens would have liked. Between 1953 and 1965, total household and commercial consumption increased over 150 per cent, but between 1965 and 1978 it increased only 34 per cent. This shows clearly how the household and commercial sectors were squeezed.

The household sector in China accounted for only 17.2 per cent of total energy consumption in 1979, whereas it accounted for 38 per cent in the US, 26 per cent in  England,  36.3  per  cent  in  France,  and  20.0  per  cent  in  Japan.  Industry accounted for 69.4 per cent in China, while it accounted for 36 per cent, 37.9 per cent, 44.5 per cent, and 57.0 per cent in the same four countries respectively, 27.7 per cent in India, and 68.2 per cent in the USSR. 116 While China's total population increased by nearly 70 per cent between 1952 and 1978, per capita energy consumption increased nearly  650  per  cent,  but  at  that  to  only  805 kg  of  coal equivalent in 1978 (and this was relatively inefficient consumption), whereas it was 11,374 in the US, 7,121 in East Germany, 5,500 in the USSR, 3,825 in Japan,

and 2,461 in Singapore. 117 India' s per capita energy consumption was considerably behind China's at 176 kg of coal equivalent.

The efficiency  of  coal  consumption  in  the  industrial  sector  was  particularly poor. Table 3.30, which gives energy consumed in kilograms of coal equivalent per 1980 US dollar' s worth of GVIO, shows that China consumed over four times as much as various high-income countries, over twice as much as various middleincome countries, and about the same as India. In steel production, when comparing 1979 statistics for the more efficient Chinese steel mills (Anshan, Wuhan, and Baoshan) with 1977 data for the Nagoya steel mill in Japan, it was found that China  consumed  17  per  cent  more  energy  in  iron-smelting,  12  per  cent  more in coking, 40 per cent more in sintering, fourteen times more in steel smelting in Bessemer converters, 109 per cent more in pre-rolling, and 166 per cent more in steel-rolling. 118 The efficiency rates at the older, smaller mills were far worse.

Efficiency of consumption in the household sector was, not surprisingly, also low with China consuming over three times the amount of energy that other lowincome countries did per unit of GDP , and about five times the average for the high-income countries (see Table 3.31).

## Coal in thermal electric power generation

During the First Five Y ear Plan period about 10 per cent of all the coal output was devoted to power generation, and thereafter the proportion rose slowly to 20 per cent in 1978, compared to an average of about 37 per cent of that in the Pacific countries, 55 in the European, 58 in the OECD, and 63 in the North American in the same year. 119 Over the thirty years from 1949 to 1978 the ratio of thermal to hydroplant generation varied from about 75 : 25 to 90 : 10. However, installed thermal electricity generation capacity as a proportion of total electricity generation  capacity  decreased  from  91.4  per  cent  in  1949  to  69.7  per  cent  in  1978

(see Table 3.32). The fuel used in the thermal plants in 1978 was 73.3 per cent coal, 24.7 per cent oil, and 2.0 per cent gas. 120

Of the projects with which the Soviets assisted in the First Five Y ear Plan, 76 were thermal plants. Equipment and technical assistance were also received from Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, and Hungary. Table 3.32 shows that installed thermal generating capacity increased from 1.69 million kW in 1949 to 39.84 in 1978, while the amount of electricity generated rose from 3.6 billion kWh to 212.0. The average growth rates between 1953 and 1978 were 13.3 and 16.2,  respectively  (see  Table  3.33).  As  with  the  coal  industry,  the  disruption caused by Mao's campaigns in this period was reflected in irregular annual increments in thermal capacity.

Tables 3.19-3.21 give the amount of investment in thermal and hydro plants in total,  and  as  proportions of total energy and industrial investment. The figures reflect the fact that in the late 1950s it was hoped hydroelectric plants could play a larger role. However, it was found they took too long to build and were too capital intensive, and then in the 1970s hope was transferred to having more oil-fired plants.  Domestic  oil  supplies  proved  too  limited  and  the  plants  that  had  been converted to oil had to be reconverted to coal.

In 1978 China's output of total electricity generated ranked sixth in the world but all of the main cities were forced to ration the available power. Households used electricity almost exclusively for lighting. Per capita consumption of electricity increased from 12.8 kWh in 1952 to 268.4 in 1978. 121 For comparison, in 1978 the average was 159 kWh in Asia, of which it was 1,946 on Taiwan, 1,981 in Hong Kong, and 138 in India. The average was 335 in Africa, 772 in Latin America,  4,175  in  the  USSR,  2,639  in  non-OECD  Europe,  3,890  in  OECD Europe, and 1,684 in the world. 122

On the eve of the reform era about 70 per cent of the thermal power was generated by several thousand plants of between 30 and 100 MW , most of which were built in the 1950s, though some were much older - up to sixty years old. 123 The rest  was generated by about 1,340 plants with capacities of over 500 MW , and 56 plants in the 250-500 MW range. 124 The first 100 MW unit in the US had been put into operation before 1930, and in the Soviet Union in 1939. However, China did not have one even of this limited capacity until 1968. 125 The largest thermal plant, at Qinghe (Liaoning), was only 1,100 MW , whereas many other countries by this time had 3,000 MW plants and larger.

The  thousands  of  small  thermal  plants,  which  were  the  cheapest  and  most quickly built sources of electricity available to the rural areas, were highly inefficient and a main source of what in the West would have been unacceptably high pollution levels. Coal consumption in grams of standard coal equivalent per gross kWh at thermal electric plants of 6 MW or larger decreased from 727 in 1952 to 434 in 1978, but this was much higher than the 360 required in the US and 330 in the USSR. 126 The total capacity of the plants was nowhere near enough to meet the demand, and they were used far in excess of their designed capacity. The capacity  factor  was  0.61  in  1978,  and  they  were  operated  on  average  for

6,018  hours  per  year,  up  from  3,457  hours  in  1952. 127 Some  in  Beijing  and Shanghai were run for more than 7,000 hours. 128

The transmission equipment and lines were also of relatively low capacity, and the main grids were not connected. Before 1979 it was not possible to transmit electricity from surplus to deficit areas. The load factors were very high and there were rarely any reserves. In 1949 there were 11,410 km of 110 kV transmission lines. The first 220 kV line was built in 1954, and the first 330 kV line in 1972. 129 By 1979 there were 32 power grids, and 61,000 km of 110 kV lines, 25,000 of 220kV lines, and 81 of 330 kV lines. 130 No 500kV lines were built before 1980.

## Factors contributing to poor consumption efficiency

A major factor in China' s poor energy efficiency was the structure of the economy. Between 1952 and 1978 GDP structure changed from 50.5 per cent primary activities,  20.9  secondary of which industry was 17.6, and tertiary activities 28.6, to 28.1  primary,  48.2  secondary  of  which  industry  was  44.3,  and  tertiary  22.3. 131 Light  industry  as  a  proportion  of  total  agricultural  and  industrial  output  value increased only slightly from 29.4 per cent in 1953 to 32.4 in 1978, while the proportion of heavy industry more than doubled from 17.5 per cent to 42.8. 132 Average coal  consumption  at  136,212  tons  per  100,000  yuan  of  heavy  industrial  output value in 1980 was nearly six times greater than for light industry at 23,458. 133

In combination with this weighting towards heavy industry was the dominant role of coal. Although the proportion of total energy consumed in the form of coal

dropped very significantly between 1952 and 1978, from 94.3 per cent to 70.7, China's reliance on this, the least efficient fossil fuel, was far greater than in most countries (see Table 3.34). 134

The large proportion of unwashed coal markedly reduced consumption efficiency (see first section of this chapter). Abnormally, large amounts were needed in the industrial boilers and in thermal energy production. Some 18 per cent of the coal supplied to the railways was wasted because it had not been treated. In a shipment of 300 million tons of coal 15 per cent would be waste rock, causing the engines to consume an extra 1.7 million tons of coal. 135

Possibly up to 65 per cent of the low efficiency of industrial energy consumption was attributable to the mismatch of coal-consuming equipment with available types of coal. Different kinds of coal have different thermal characteristics, and ideally the various coal-consuming industries are supplied with the most appropriate type and form. For example, boilers, kilns, and power generators operate best with steam coal. 136 However, in some provinces, 70-80 per cent of the fuel used was coking coal. 137

In 1980 some 80 per cent of the coal supplied to the chemical fertilizer industry was of the wrong type. Rather than the preferred medium-sized anthracite, shipments  of  small-sized  unwashed  coal  and  coal  dust  were  supplied,  and  as a result, 5 million tons of coal were consumed unnecessarily. 138 There could have been energy savings of 15-20 per cent had lump or pellet coal been used by the railways and chemical industry, and of 3-5 per cent had powdered coal been used in electricity generation and civilian consumption.

The  lack  of  recyclable  scrap  metal  also  greatly  reduced  China' s  energy consumption efficiency. In developed countries, large amounts of steel scrap are available.  However, China' s  scrap  usage,  though  similar  to  Japan' s,  was  10-20 per cent lower than in other major steel-producing countries. 139

Note: The average for this group of countries is 22.2 per cent.

The technology in China's industrial sector was generally very basic. Of the 26,000 types of products manufactured by the Ministry of Machine Building in the late 1970s, 55 per cent were of the 1940-50s generation, 40 per cent of 1960s, and only 5 per cent of 1970s. 140 The persistent use of such old equipment was due to the planned low rates of depreciation, the lack of capital to buy new equipment, and the fact that China' s engineers, isolated from the West, were simply unaware of  new  energy-saving  technologies.  Many  of  the  iron  and  steel  plants  were  of 1950s or earlier vintage and consumed large amounts of coal. About a third of China's steel-making capacity still used open hearth furnaces which in the West had long ago been decommissioned and replaced with the much more efficient electric arc.

Another factor was the size of the plants. According to one estimate, the much more numerous medium- and small-sized iron and steel plants consumed 3.23 more  tons  of  standard  coal  per  ton  of  steel  produced  than  the  larger  ones. 141 During the 'Backyard Furnace Campaign' in 1958 there was appalling wastage of coal in steel-making, and much of the iron and steel produced from the thousands of small blast furnaces was of such poor quality it could not be used. Up to five tons of raw coal were required to produce one ton of pig iron in 1958, and consumption in 1960 could have been reduced by about 55 million tons had the 1957 level of thermal efficiency been maintained. 142

The  technical  level  of  China' s  180,000  industrial  boilers  was  also  basic.  In 1980 they had only 55 per cent efficiency, some 20-30 per cent less than in the industrialized world. 143 The efficiency rate for industrial ovens was even worse than for boilers, at 20-30 per cent in China, compared to 50-60 per cent in the West and in Japan. 144

Old technology also affected the efficiency of the chemical industry. For example, in the early 1980s the chemical industry in Shanghai accounted for one-sixth to one-seventh of the nationwide gross value of production in the industry and generated over one-quarter of the profits. Y et most of the equipment dated to the 1930s and 1940s. 145 The same was true for ammonia production. To produce one ton of ammonia required 1.2 tons of standard coal in Japan, but 2.84 tons in China. 146 The Chinese equipment was of small capacity and low technological standard.

It was  explained  earlier  that  coal  prices  were  deliberately  kept  low. Consequently, consumers of coal in all the socialist countries were quantity takers and they had no incentive to economize in their use of it. As output targets rather than profits were the ultimate gauge of success for them as well, they concentrated on increasing production, almost entirely ignoring the costs. The prevailing attitude was de bu chang xian - what one gains cannot offset the losses, or,  it  is  not  worth  the  effort.  Industrial  consumers had nothing to lose by their wasteful practices and nothing to gain if they spent time and materials trying to improve production efficiency.

The  system  was  such  that  top  level  planners  were  fully  occupied  trying  to ensure that all of the various energy-consuming enterprises reached their output targets and that the products were delivered to the specified ministries. There were no energy conservation targets in the pre-reform years. 147 At the production level,

rewards were given to managers for meeting the output targets, but none were given for building improved or specialized types of boilers, railway locomotives, thermal plant equipment, etc., or devising more efficient operation plans. There was no point to doing anything other than to produce more of the same product, and  to  continue  in  established  work  routines  rather  than  experiment  with  new ideas. In other words, no one at any level would risk the time, effort, and resources to deviate from fulfilling the assigned output targets. This is a recognized problem of command planning. One Soviet specialist put it this way:

No Soviet producer has to worry about disposing of what he produces, and the problem of the enterprise director is only to fulfill the plan. So unless a  pressure  for  innovation  has  been  built  into  the  plan  by  people  at  some higher  level,  the  manager  has  no  incentive  to  produce  a  better  product â¦ Indeed, he has a vested interest in continuing to produce his present kind of output even if it is technically obsolete. 148

Besides, there simply was not enough 'slack' in the system for such experimentation.  Even  if  those  operating  the  boilers,  thermal  plants,  etc.,  had  ideas  for improving their operations, they could not test them because they were allocated only sufficient  capital  and  materials  to  fulfil  the  output  targets,  nothing  more. This tautness is also a characteristic of central planning.

Possibly, 35 per cent of coal wastage was attributable to poor management. 149 A low average level of skills and few trained technicians and engineers are general  problems  in  any  developing  country.  However,  in  China  the  situation  had been exacerbated by the deliberate demotion of skilled people. During the First Five Y ear Plan the few fully qualified engineers available were placed in appropriate positions, but later the use of professional advice was shunned, first in the GLF and then more especially during the Cultural Revolution (see Chapter 2). Party personnel intentionally selected to 'manage' the industrial enterprises, and chosen solely on the basis of political criteria, often had little expertise in management. They were satisfied merely to see that their output targets were reached and were either completely unaware that operations could be carried out more efficiently,  or  were  without  the  knowledge  to  improve  them.  The  following description of the situation in Hungarian steel mills could have been written about China's steel mills:

If  molten ore poured forth from the furnaces and steel from the Bessemer furnaces, if the rolling plants worked at all, the problem was considered successfully solved; as a matter of fact, nobody paid any attention to the costs. 150

Annual allocations of coal were largely based on the previous year' s allocations and as there was no monitoring of the output value of coal consumption from year to year, the central planners had less and less accurate knowledge of how much was actually needed for any given process. One writer summarized the difficulties: (a) the materials consumption quotas were not standard - some enterprises

did not even have quotas, (b) management was ineffectual - for example, cement plants of comparable size used vastly different amounts of coal, and (c) enterprise leadership  did  not  fully  understand  the  importance  of  consumption  quotas. 151 Another said:

Recently, after various places promoted an economy movement for the use of coal, it was discovered that those units where coal waste is serious, are just those that have excessive coal storage. Because there is plenty of coal, which can be obtained easily, it is used liberally and managed casually. Some units even have no statistics, no quota and no operation regulations. They have no way to find out how much has been wasted. 152

The lack of contact with the West due to the government' s closed door policy compounded all these problems. The Chinese remained oblivious to the progress being made in reducing materials consumption.

## Summary

The First Five Y ear Plan, drawn up with the help of the Soviets, called for largescale development in the established coal mining areas of the north and northeast. The entire country faced severe coal shortages and, though the Soviet plans for the industry promised enormous production potential ultimately, the demand for coal was immediate and countrywide. Major problems with the Soviet strategy for Mao and his supporters were the lengthy lead-times and the regional concentration. The Soviet-assisted projects generally served only the established urban industrial areas of the north and northeast, doing little to mitigate the demand for coal and economic growth in other regions. The GLF was one of Mao's responses to these shortcomings, and the policies he put forth in 1958 called for decentralized, small-scale production, exactly the opposite of what had been detailed in the First Five Y ear Plan. The results of the GLF were devastating both in human and economic terms, production fell markedly in the years immediately following, and planning collapsed. It was this disarray that precipitated the departure of the Soviet personnel in 1960.

The economy was just beginning to recover from the GLF when Mao launched the  Cultural  Revolution,  another  campaign  aimed  at  reducing  the  disparities between the urban and rural regions. Apart from a recurrent halting of production and  disruption  of  transport  due  to  factional  fighting,  the  worst  effects  of  the Cultural Revolution on the coal industry, indeed, on the economy as a whole, were the removal to the countryside of the scientists, technicians, and academics, and the government's insistence on pursuing a 'closed-door' policy.

The Third Front Development Programme was equally, if not more disastrous than the Cultural Revolution. The creation of a heavy industry base in a remote area  put  an  enormous  strain  on  the  economy. The  government  allocated  huge sums of investment capital to the Programme virtually to the total neglect of the coast. All of the Third Front projects, including the coal mines and railroads, were

hastily  assembled  with  little  or  no  preparation  and  were  constantly  breaking down. Any spatial rationality that had existed between the good coal production areas and the existing high consumption centres was gone. Production and consumption  relationships  throughout  the  country  were  seriously  skewed  and  the resulting costs of mining poor quality coal and transporting it over treacherous terrain were extremely high.

By the eve of the reform and opening up programme, most of the original leaders of the centralized and decentralized factions had died, and the country faced crippling coal shortages. In the mid-1970s a compromise solution had been set in motion.  Providing  technical  support,  the  government  encouraged  the  development of LNS mines throughout the country because they had not only proven themselves, but the simple fact was that any coal produced by whatever means was  desperately  needed.  The  government  decided  that  the  limited  investment funds  available  could  best  be  used  in  expanding  large-scale  production  in  the areas where the reserves were easiest to exploit, namely Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Guizhou, and building the required railway and port infrastructure to transport it to the main consumption centres in the east and south.

Despite many problems associated with central planning, the recurring politicallyinduced upheavals, general economic backwardness and poverty, and the fact that there was very little opencast mining, China' s total production rose to third place in the world in 1978 and production growth over the first thirty years of the PRC had been highest.

Soviet-style  command  planning,  with  its  paramount  emphasis  on  achieving quantitative targets, failed in the Chinese coal industry as it had in the fuel industries of other command economies. In addition to the inherent motivational weaknesses, it was impossible for the planners to have full knowledge of production, financing,  transport,  and  consumption  relationships  over  so  large  and  diverse a country, and to orchestrate all of the lateral connections among them.

Inadequate investment and the policy of keeping the prices of producer goods very low resulted in the coal industry' s having chronic deficits and the recurring necessity to seek 'safety-valve' assistance from the small non-state mines when output was desperately needed. With scarcely enough capital to maintain operations, let alone improve and develop them, heavy government subsidization was required to keep the industry functioning. After the departure of the Soviets no new technologies had been introduced, and the average levels of worker production were very low. Only a small fraction of the coal was washed. Insufficient capital  investment  contributed  to  the  constantly  imbalanced  output-capacity ratio.

The Soviet Union and China had the highest railway freight densities in the world, but like the coal industry, the railways also received insufficient capital investment and the price for their services was too low. The two countries probably had the highest losses of coal shipments due to hoarding and equipment malfunction resulting from over-use. Water transport played but a small role in China.

As a proportion of total energy consumption, coal accounted for a larger proportion than in any other country, and consumption efficiency was very low. Coal

consuming equipment was old and badly maintained, creating heavy pollution. The  capacity  of  the  thermal  plants  and  transmission  networks  was  woefully inadequate to meet the needs of a country trying to modernize quickly.

Prior to 1979, with the exception of the prematurely abandoned First Five Y ear Plan, the government had no consistent, focused strategy. The amounts of funding given to the industry changed radically from year to year and the directives concerning coal, railway transport, and thermal power plants were too often ad hoc and short-term responses to the crisis of the moment. On numerous occasions the plans were completed late, or were approved and subsequently changed after the beginning of the year in which they were meant to be applied. The coal industry, reflecting the economy as a whole, was in critical need of a comprehensive and  integrated  long-term  strategy. The  economy  had  stalled,  the  cadres  lacked direction, and the masses were cynical. The Chinese leadership realized that they had not only failed to meet their own industrial and modernization targets, but that China was falling behind other Asian developing countries. Deng Xiaoping and his colleagues were keen to address the immediate problems and press on towards the achievement of the Four Modernizations.

## The industry and Deng's reforms

## Introduction

It  was  at  the Third  Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, which began 18 December 1978, that the reform and opening up ( gaige kaifeng ) programme was formally introduced. Included in the Session' s communique was the following:

While we have achieved political stability and unity and are restoring and adhering to the economic policies that proved effective over a long time, we are now, in the light of the new historical conditions and practical experience, adopting a number of major new economic measures, conscientiously transforming the system and methods of economic management, actively expanding economic co-operation on terms of quality and mutual benefit with other countries on the basis of self-reliance, striving to adopt the world' s advanced technologies and equipment and greatly strengthening scientific and educational work to meet the needs of modernization. 1

Only  three  days  earlier,  after  long  negotiations,  Beijing  and  Washington  had released a joint communiquÃ© calling for the establishment of normal diplomatic relations on 1 January 1979 and an exchange of ambassadors between Beijing and Washington was to be implemented on 1 March 1979. The Chinese eagerly anticipated a large inflow of American capital and expertise.

In April 1979 the government launched a three-year period of economic 'readjustment, restructuring, consolidating, and improving'. By then Deng Xiaoping had displaced Hua Guofeng as paramount leader of the country, and the targets for the Ten Y ear Plan (1976-85), which had superseded the Fifth Five Y ear Plan (1976-80), were dropped because it was all too apparent they were hopelessly unrealistic. A main cause of the economy' s plateauing was the persistent shortage of energy, and a major, if not the most critical goal of the economic programme in the following years was to increase energy supply and reduce consumption. 2 The revised 1979 plan stated: 'stress is placed on speeding up the development of agriculture and the light and textile industries and on expanding production and construction in the coal, petroleum, power and building material industries, and

in  transport  services. At  the  same  time,  arrangements  for  production  in  other industries are to accord with the availability of fuel and power â¦' 3

The Chinese Government was very much aware at this time that international oil  supplies  were  again  in  jeopardy.  The  reforms  in  China  had  hardly  been launched when in January 1979 the Shah of Iran was driven into exile and exports of  oil  from  what  had  been  the  world' s  second  largest  exporter  ceased.  Panic buying ensued and prices trebled, again causing serious economic repercussions in the rest of the world.

The Sixth Five Y ear Plan (1981-85) listed many goals for the coal industry, and with the publishing of the first Zhongguo meitan gongye nianjian (China Coal Industry Y earbook)  in  1983,  covering  up  to  and  including  1981,  a  plethora  of government  plans  for  reform  were  announced.  Subsequent  Y earbooks  would include  dozens  of  speeches  and  reports  by  Ministry  and  government  officials. Also  in  these  early  reform  years  the  academic  and  professional  journals  were filled with debate on the appropriate extent and speed of the proposed changes. 4

## The speeches and writings of Coal Minister Gao Yangwen, 1979-85

Gao Yangwen replaced Xiao Han as Minister of the Coal Industry in December 1979 and remained in office until June 1985, when he was succeeded by former Vice-Minister Yu Hongen. 5 It is clear from reading Gao' s speeches and writings that he understood the problems in the industry, and that he was candidly critical of what he called the 'blindness' and 'rigidity' of the administration and management. This boldness may have been a consequence of his having close personal ties to Communist Party Secretary - General Hu Yaobang. 6 He summarized the industry' s difficulties in the following eight specific points: the planning administration,  production  line,  labour  administration,  and  product  distribution  were all dead ( guo si ), finances were governed by the central authorities, wages were distributed according to egalitarian principles, the pricing system was irrational, and the management leadership was many-headed and fragmented. 7

He believed that the industry needed to break through the 'multiple motherin-law' problem by reducing the number of regulatory bodies. To him the key element  of  reform  was  accountability  at  all  levels.  He  also  believed  that  the significant role of the Party had hampered production, and it was now imperative to remove its manipulative influence on operational decisions. Development of the industry had to take place 'at a relatively steady pace (as against precipitous surges  and  declines),  â¦ the  technical  and  management  quality  improved,  and intra-industry investment ratios well coordinated â¦' 8

Gao saw the impossibility of ever producing sufficient coal to satisfy demand fully when the general consumption efficiency was so low. To meet the country' s present and future energy needs, increased production had to be combined with reductions in consumption achieved through technical, planning, and organizational improvements. In one of his key articles he admonished: 'The practice of regarding energy conservation as the central point in the technical transformation

and structural reform of the entire national economy is a major and important step toward materializing social modernization.' 9 In a speech in 1982 he noted: 'The [central authorities have] already made it clear that the Ministry of Coal Industry (MCI) should not simply be engaged in coal production, but should also open up a  path  for  the  development  of  coal  utilization â¦' 10 The two means he saw for doing this were to widen the range of coal products available so that users were not restricted to using raw coal, and working in close cooperation with the large consuming industries, for example, thermal plants, chemicals, cement, etc.

Significantly, it was at the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, held in October 1984, that it was decided mandatory planning should give way to guidance planning. In his article published in the principal energy journal in 1985 he raised the following crucial questions:

- 1. What proportions of the coal should be subject to centralized distribution, guidance planning and market forces?
- 2. How can command planning be reduced?
- 3. What means of 'economic leverage' can be used to ensure that plan targets are met?
- 4. How can  coal  pricing  be  changed  to  ensure  that  all  production  costs  are covered and a rational profit level is attained but without having a negative effect on the costs of other goods? Should a series of small measures be taken or one major change? Should attention be first given to coal sold at negotiated  prices  or  coal  'under  plan'?  How  can  fixed,  floating  and  negotiated prices be integrated?
- 5. How  can  coal  mine  development  be  funded?  How  can  construction  be improved in  terms  of  the  amount  of  time  and  resources  required  to  build mines and in terms of the quality of construction?
- 6. How can producers and consumers cooperate?
- 7. What labour reforms should be carried out to improve safety conditions, stabilize the labour force, raise the quality of the labour force and better link remuneration with output and skills?
- 8. How can the whole coal industry hierarchy be reformed? 11

Gao knew that solving these problems would require major structural changes to the economy as a whole.

## Production

## Overview

The Coal Exploration Corporation was established in March 1982 and a plan for coal production was devised at a national coal planning conference in November that year. 12 In order to meet the target of quadrupling the gross value of industrial output by 2000, it was planned that production should double from 600 million tons in 1980 to 1.2 billion tons (1,200 million tons) in 2000. The planned average

annual rate of growth for the entire period was to be 3.4 per cent with an average annual  increment  of  30  million  tons.  Growth  in  the  first  ten  years  was  to  be 2.6 per cent per year with total output in 1985 surpassing 700 million tons and in 1990 exceeding 800 million tons. Emphasis was to be placed on intensifying and expanding development at existing mines in the east region. Between 1990 and 2000 the planned average annual increment was 40 million tons and the annual growth rate was to be 4.1 per cent, with most of the expansion in output taking place in 'the three wests', namely Shanxi , Shaanxi , and Xi Nei Menggu (western Inner Mongolia), and in Guizhou. 13 For comparison, between 1949 and 1978 the average  annual  increment  had  been  20.2  million  tons,  and  the  average  annual growth rate 12.8. Coal from the three wests was particularly desirable not only because it  was  easier  to  mine  than  coal  in  other  areas,  but  it  had  much  lower sulphur levels.

There was a two-pronged strategy to reduce the strain on the railways, of which one was to build many more mine-mouth power plants. The electric power would be transmitted along high-tension wires from the remote mining regions to the cities. In addition to the building of thermal power stations it was necessary to integrate the existing fragmented railway network and standardize the gauge of some lines. Shanxi Province was to provide electricity to Jiangsu, Guangdong, and  Shandong;  Shaanxi  and  Gansu  to  Sichuan;  and  Guizhou  to  Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan.

The other prong was to build power plants near sea ports. Northern coal would be  transported  by  rail  from  the  interior  mines  to  the  coast  where  it  would  be loaded into large ships for delivery to central and southern port cities. Thermal power stations  were  to  be  built  in  or  near  coastal  cities  such  as  Hangzhou  (Jiangsu), Waigaoqiao (Shanghai), Zhenhai (Zhejiang), Fuzhou (Fujian), and Zhuhai and Shenzhen (Guangdong).

A key element of the plans for the coal industry was the use of foreign technology and expertise. In April and May 1980, The People' s Republic of China had replaced The Republic of China at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, respectively. The government envisaged the same forms of cooperation and assistance in the coal industry as were being considered for other industries: joint ventures, loans, training programmes, cooperative research, exchanges, compensation trade agreements, etc.

To meet the 1.2 billion-ton-target, output from the existing CMAs was to be raised from 344 million tons in 1980 to 400 million in 2000, and from LS and LNS mines from 276 million tons to 500 million, and 400 million tons were to come from new mines. The combined increases equalled 1.3 billion tons. This was planned in order that the target of 1.2 billion tons could be guaranteed.

Of the 400 million tons from new capacity, 200 million tons were to come from opencast mines. The proportion of total output from these mines was to increase from 2.3 per cent in 1980 to 17 per cent in 2000. Thus, the scale of these mines was to be far larger than any previous coal development. The other 200 million tons were to come from medium and small mines. New development was to be focused on ten energy bases, especially on the Shanxi Energy Base.

## Existing mines

In order to meet the 2000 target of 1.2 billion tons, it was planned that measures be taken to enable the large mines built before 1980 to maintain high production rates for as long as possible. As noted above, output from the existing CMAs was to be raised from 344 million tons in 1980 to 400 in 2000. In 1983 there were some 554 such mines. 14 There were two ways of increasing this output, through improved mine design and the use of more advanced mining technology. A survey in 1981 revealed that over 130 mines were operating at less than 65 per cent capacity  because  they  had  been  put  into  production  before  construction  was complete, had poor management, or incompatible project phases. Thus, it was believed that there was considerable potential in developing these mines, many of which were situated in the east region. The cost per ton of building a new mine was 40-60 per cent higher than renovating or expanding an existing mine. 15 The Production Department of the MCI estimated that nationwide output from these large  state  mines  would,  however,  be  reduced  after  2000  by  70  million  tons, 40 million due to decommissioning and 30 million due to old age and concomitant lower production. 16

## Opencast mines

Output from opencast mines was to play a much larger role in fuelling the economy. It was well known that production per year at opencast mines was generally twice as high as from underground mines, construction time was at least 25 per cent shorter, construction and operating costs were far less, and that working conditions were much safer. The share of production from this type of mine was to increase from 2.3 per cent of total output in 1980 to 17 per cent in 2000. The use of foreign technology was repeatedly stressed, for this was a situation where the Chinese knew it would be more expeditious to use the latest technology available elsewhere rather than develop their own. 17 The five main opencast mines were Antaibao (Shanxi), and Huolinhe, Jungar, Yiminhe, and Yuanbaoshan (all in Inner Mongolia), all of which were to be developed with foreign assistance.

In May 1979 Dr Armand Hammer, who had made several contracts with the Soviet Union since the 1920s, went to China to try to establish a Sino-American cooperative agreement in either chemicals, oil and gas, or coal. 18 After five years of  negotiations  and  a  feasibility  study  completed  in  July  1983,  the  Antaibao Surface  Coal  Mine  Joint  Venture  agreement  was  finally  concluded  in  April 1984. 19 The total value of the project was to be about US$649 million.

Initially Hammer's Occidental Petroleum Company had a 50 per cent interest, but in November 1984 Peter Kiewat and Sons, Occidental's 25 per cent equity partner, withdrew and was replaced by the Bank of China. Thus, Occidental ultimately held a 25 per cent stake, the Bank of China Trust and Consultancy Company 25  per  cent,  the  China  National  Coal  Development  Corporation  (CNCDC) 42.5 per cent, and the China International Trust and Investment Corporation and Shanxi Province together, held 7.5 per cent. Occidental' s operating company was

Island Creek Coal Company Ltd. (ICCC), while CNCDC's was the Pingshuo First Coal  Company  Ltd.  (PSF).  A  US$475  limited  recourse  loan  was  syndicated by  thirty-nine  banks,  the  main  ones  being  Bank  of  America,  Credit  Lyonais, Industrial Bank of Japan, the Royal Bank of Canada, and the Bank of China.

It  was  the  largest  joint  venture  contract  with  an American company that the Communist government had ever signed and was much publicized. 20 The Vice President of Marketing for ICCC effused:

the success of Antaibao is of 'supreme importance' to the highest levels of the Chinese government as well as to the joint venture partners â¦ The government looks to the project 'as a demonstration to the world of the security and  health  of  the  China  investment  environment'.  Despite  problems  and delays, there is a bright future for the mine â¦ As the closest source of reliable, consistent quality steam coal to many areas of the Pacific Rim, we are confident that, with a well coordinated marketing effort, the mine will enjoy an equally successful and financially rewarding public life. 21

Located  about  9 km  north  of  Pinglu  county' s  township  and  23 km  south  of Shuoxian  county's  township,  the  total  area  of Antaibao  was  18.5 km 2 and  had close to 500 million tons of low sulphur steaming coal with heating values of up to 7,600 kcal per kg, the highest in the country. Construction began in July 1985 and the opening ceremony was held in September 1987. The contracts for cooperation were to last thirty years. The expected annual production from the first phase of the project was 15.33 million tons, of which 12 million would be washed, and 9 million would be exported, about three times what nationwide exports had been in 1978. It was anticipated that each of the second and third phases would also eventually produce 15 million tons per year. Export sales from both ICCC and PSF over the first twelve years were to be handled exclusively by the China National  Coal  Import  and  Export  Corporation  (CNCIEC).  Second  and  third mines to be built in subsequent phases of the project were to produce another 15 millions tons each.

The  foreign  side  was  to  contribute  about  US$200  million  worth  of  foreign equipment and to hire the project design firm. The Chinese side was to provide labour and local materials for the mine site, construct a residential village with housing for 17,000 miners and their families, office buildings, training centres, nurseries, primary schools, cinemas, etc., and to carry out improvements to the railways and Qinhuangdao Port.

For the first twelve years of the project the foreign engineers and experts hired by ICCC were to serve as the managers, while the local PSF men would serve as deputy  managers.  Over  the  following  eighteen-year  period,  the  roles  of  the foreign and Chinese would be reversed with the Chinese side in control.

The other four opencast mines, all opened with foreign assistance, are in Inner Mongolia. The Huolinhe mine, in the east, has brown coal. Annual production was to reach 30 million tons, most of which was to be used in the Tongliao power plant and other plants located along the Tonghuo railway line. 22 The Jungar coalfield, 150km south of Hohhot, has long flame coal with low sulphur content. Annual

production was to reach 30 million tons. Also planned for this site were a coal preparation plant and a slurry pipeline to Qinhuangdao. 23 Yiminhe mine, 85km south of Hailar City, has lignite coal. There was to be a total of seven pits with a combined capacity of 55 million tons, and a large pithead power plant was to be built. 24 Yuanbaoshan mine,  located  in  Chifeng  City,  has  old  aged  brown  coal. Annual production was to reach 8 million tons. 25

## Energy bases

Construction of the Shanxi Energy Base was first proposed in December 1980, and in 1982 the State Council set up the Shanxi Regional Energy Planning Office. The ultimate goal was to make it one of the largest coal operations in the world. It  has  a  total  area  of  about  330,000 km 2 and  includes  the  entire  Province  of Shanxi,  the  Jungar  region  of  Inner  Mongolia,  northern  Shaanxi,  and  western Henan. Some 60-70 per cent of the nation' s total reserves are located in this area. The 2000 target set for the entire base was 600 million tons, half of the initial target set for the country as a whole. Of this a minimum of 400 million tons would come from Shanxi Province alone where the reserves are the largest and best quality in China. As of 1983 they amounted to 20.54 billion tons, or one-third of the national total, and covered 37 per cent of the Province' s total area. 26 Relatively speaking, the coal has low ash, sulphur, and phosphate content. The coal at Datong is  the  richest  in  the  country,  generating  up  to  8,000 kcal  per  kg. The  country' s largest  anthracite  deposit  is  at  the  Province' s  Qinshui  field. Another  advantage of these deposits is that they are generally found in relatively simple geological structures,  that  is,  they  are  shallow-lying,  averaging  200-300 m  underground (less than half the national average), the incline is low, there are few faults, and 70-80 per cent are classified as medium to thick. As a result, the coal is relatively easy to extract and the mining costs are far less than the national average.

The base is also rich in other key raw materials such as copper, iron ore, oil, natural gas,  mirabilite,  salt,  soda,  and  gypsum.  Many  high  energy-consuming industries such as coking, thermal plants, aluminium oxide, electrolytic aluminium, synthetic ammonia, nitrophosphate, synthetic fibres, plastics, rubber, dye, medicine, and explosive plants were planned for the area.

Between 1982 and 2000 ten coal bases were to be established in Hebei, Central Shanxi,  Southeast  Shanxi,  Liaoning,  Heilongjiang,  Anhui,  Shandong,  Henan, Shaanxi, and Guizhou. 27 The Shenhua Coal Project was started in 1985 and comprised several sub-projects the main ones of which were: mining of the ShenfuDongsheng  coal  deposit  which  is  on  the  border  of  Shaanxi  and  the  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and has some 33 per cent of China's verified coal resources; the construction of a second west-east trunk railway line from Shenmu in  northern  Shaanxi  through  Baotou  to  Huanghua  Harbour in Hebei Province; expansion of the Huanghua Harbour to an annual handling capacity of 35 million tons; and a large power plant at Fugu, also in northern Shaanxi. 28 It was expected that eventually 100 million tons would be mined each year and shipped to other parts of China, and to world markets.

## Local mine development

Output from LS and LNS mines was planned to increase from 276 million tons in 1980 to 500 million tons in 2000. By the late 1970s it had been recognized that the fastest output growth was being achieved by these mines and that their continued and expanded contribution was vital to the economy. Furthermore, as most of the capital was raised locally, basic wages were much lower than those at the large state mines, and as grain rations, housing, sick leave, and medical and retirement benefits were rarely given, the central government was relieved of a major financial burden. The cost of opening or expanding an LS or LNS mine was much less capital intensive than for larger projects. Whereas it cost about 108 yuan per ton to open a large new state mine in Shanxi, it cost only about 40 yuan per ton to build an LS mine and about 16 for an LNS mine. 29 Construction time was generally only two to three years versus six to ten for large mines, and operation costs were some 50 to 80 per cent less. Most importantly, it was thought that locally produced coal could help solve the critical energy shortages problem if it could be made more readily available to consumers, that is, out of plan. In addition, the central and provincial governments hoped the development of local mines would add  to  the  wealth  of  peasants,  reduce  rural  unemployment,  stem  rural-urban immigration flows, stimulate the development of rural industry, and halt the ecological damage being caused by the scavenging for firewood and plant stalks.

Between  1980  and  2000  output  from  local  mines  was  to  increase  over  80 per cent, whereas output from CMAs was to increase by only 16 per cent. Thus, the local mine sector was immediately given a number of incentives to increase production. For example, the Shanxi provincial government endorsed the establishment of a Local Mine Bureau in 1979 to oversee production from LS, handicraft, and army-run mines, and steps were taken to improve their organization. 30 In  December  1981  the  State  Council  approved  four  financial  incentives  for local mines: (1) granting of subsidies for mines with deficits, (2) reduction of or exemption from industrial and commercial taxes, (3) increasing investment for capital construction and technical transformation, and (4) increasing the retention of depreciation funds. 31

There were no restrictions on who could operate local mines. At a discussion on reform in the coal industry, Minister Gao Y angwen stated: 'â¦ small mines can be run by communes, brigades and masses â¦ or run by professional personnel â¦ cadres, technical personnel and workers can also run small mines individually or through raising funds. In a word, welcome all walks of life to run small mines.' 32 At  a  conference  on  industry  and  communications  held  in  March  1983  it  was resolved that:

Relevant departments should take measures to organize people in localities with better transport facilities to produce as much coal as possible. Localities should be vigorously guided and encouraged to raise funds to build small hydropower stations and small coal mines. Where conditions permit, people may build small thermal power stations. 33

In  April  1983  the  State  Council  approved  the Report  on  Eight  Measures  for Accelerating  the  Development  of  Small-Scale  Coalmines and  ordered  all jurisdictions  to  implement  it.  In  abridged  form,  the  eight  measures  were  as follows:

- 1. Operation  of  Mines:  Communes,  brigades,  all  trades  and  industry  are encouraged to operate mines, and the masses are encouraged to pool funds to do so. Areas which are short of coal may operate mines in partnership with places having coal.
- 2. Role of Market: (a) Coal which is to be put under unified distribution and is produced either by communes, brigades or special contracts is to be priced on the basis of quality and should be such as to assure a fair profit. Coal which is not to come under unified distribution may be sold at negotiated prices. (b) The operators of locally produced coal can haul and sell their coal anywhere, but if rail transport is required, the coal will be put under unified distribution. (c) The taxes that small mines pay will be determined on the basis  of  profits.  Mines  situated  in  coal-short  areas  or  where  conditions are difficult may apply for discretionary reduction or exemption from taxes. (d) After guaranteeing sufficient funds to continue and expand production, small mines can divide the remainder of their funds for wages and welfare benefits as they choose.
- 3. Rational  Use  of  Resources:  All  provincial  (or  autonomous  region)  coal bureaus, coal companies and geological departments are to plan the allocations of resources given to operators of small mines to exploit. Small mines can extract resources belonging to state mines that cannot be mined by large mines and within limits, resources that large mines cannot use in the near future. 34 The  operators  of  small  mines  must  abide  by  the  State  Council' s 'Decisions  on  Maintaining  Regular  Production  in  State-Owned  Mining Enterprises'.  Reckless  or  indiscriminatory  mining  is  prohibited  and  small mines cannot be operated under railroads, highways, reservoirs, dikes, protected places of cultural interest or major structures. Also, in the interests of environmental protection, mining should be done in conjunction with city and rural planning.
- 4. Multiple  Use  of  Coal  Partnership  Operations:  Processing  should  be encouraged  to  produce  coal  suitable  for  multiple  uses.  Small-scale  power plants, coal gas plants, construction materials and chemical industries should be encouraged especially in areas lacking convenient communications and transport.
- 5. Maintain Safety Standards: Small mines should abide by the 'Mine Safety Regulations' and  'Mine  Safety  Control  Regulations' issued  by  the  State Council and the 'Small Safety Rules' issued by the MCI.
- 6. Assistance: (a) Financial - The operators themselves should provide most of the funds, though where genuine difficulties exist, especially in coal-short areas, the Agricultural Bank of China may issue loans as conditions require. (b) Materials - All materials are to be guaranteed by local bureaus for small

mines whose output is to be put under unified distribution. Explosives are distributed by central materials supply departments. Materials departments and coal management departments are also to assist local mines whose output is not put under unified distribution to procure materials and equipment. (c) Technical advice - Provincial coal bureaus and state mines should organize  technical  service  personnel  to  help  the  operators  of  small  mines  with development plans, restructuring, safety measures, technical and economic efficiency.

- 7. Permits: Mining permits are to be issued only to small mines which have been approved by provincial/autonomous region governments or coal departments. Those holding mining permits are also to be issued with business permits by industrial and commercial administration departments. Holders of both permits are protected by national laws. Mines currently in operation must all be checked and under supplemental approval procedures.
- 8. Local Mine Joint Service Companies: Such companies should be established to  assist  provinces/autonomous  regions  share  experiences  in  handling  the problems of small mines, to formulate policies, manage funds, and to better coordinate relations. 35

A ten-year plan for the development of locally-run mines was devised at the National  Working  Conference  of  Locally-Run  Coal  Mines  held  in  AugustSeptember  1982. 36 In  October  1983  the  Local  Coal  Mine  Combined  Service Corporation was established to make plans for all local mines in the country output targets; technical renovation; mechanization of production, road drivage and  haulage;  safety  guidelines;  wages;  transport;  marketing;  allocation  of reserves and materials - and to liaise between the state mines and all the various types of local mines, to enforce MCI instructions for local mines, and to advise the operators. 37

Various licensing arrangements were instituted in an attempt to deter haphazard development; to reduce damage to coal seams, and prevent caving in of surface structures such as buildings and railways; and to reduce the large number of accidents caused by indiscriminate digging. In order to improve the productivity of the  mines,  some  of  which  had  a  recovery  rate  of  only  10-20  per  cent,  the government began to levy a tax based on the extent of the resources held and utilized. 38

## Expansion of treatment capacity

By the year 2000, 50 per cent of the total output was to be washed, compared to the 17 per cent washed in 1978. 39 In Shanxi Province the proportion of washed coal was to increase from 5 per cent in 1980 to 45 per cent in 2000. 40 It is apparent that the MCI was now fully aware of how wasteful the consumption of raw coal and the use of the wrong types of coal had been. Specialists wrote numerous articles  on  the  energy  savings  that  could  be  achieved  through  increased  coal treatment. 41 In November 1980 the MCI held the first ever conference on coal

quality inspection and laboratory testing. 42 At the National Working Conference on Coal Preparation held in November 1981, a major agenda item was the need to expand preparation beyond serving just the steel industry. 43 In February 1982 at the National Conference on Comprehensive Utilization of Coal, Minister Gao Yangwen proposed that each mine make a three- or five-year plan for processing. 44 In November of that year the State Council issued a set of very specific instructions  entitled Development  of  Coal  Preparation  and  Processing  and Rational Utilization of Energy . 45 For example, an outline was given of how various types of coal were best used and specific quality norms, for example, permissible sulphur and ash content levels for defined purposes. Processing facilities were to be built simultaneously with new mines, with priority being given to coal export bases, areas where operations were highly mechanized, where the coal was to be shipped long distances, or where the coal was of inferior quality. Funds for new, expanded, or reconstructed coal washeries and sizing plants, and plants for washing  coking  coal  were  to  be  included  in  budgets  for  capital  construction, while funds for steam coal washeries and screening plants, and technical transformation of existing coal preparation and screening plants were to be listed as state energy conservation and technical transformation funds.

The State Council further ordered that as of 1983 the big consumers - large iron and steel, fertilizer, power and cement plants; railway locomotives; and large cities with concentrated industries - be supplied with homogeneous shipments of the  right  sort  of  coal  from  designated  mines  and  mining  areas,  as  opposed  to diverse sources. A new set of prices according to quality specifications was to be established  by  the  end  of  1983,  approved  by  the  State  Council,  and  enforced immediately thereafter. As of 1984, cleaned and screened coal were each to be weighed separately, and by the end of 1984 all indigenous coke production was to cease.

The government placed particular emphasis on the need to experiment with the production  of  briquettes,  especially  from  low-grade  coals  and/or  by-products, with coal gasification and liquefaction, and with the use of slurries for commercial and domestic use. 46 Arrangements for several new foreign-funded coal treatment projects were initiated in the early 1980s.

## Mechanization, use of materials, and mine preparation work

In 1978, 32.52 per cent of the state mines were partially mechanized, that is, only extraction  and  tunnelling  were  mechanized.  In  1984  it  was  announced  that  by 1985, 1990, and 2000 the levels were to reach 46, 70, and 85 per cent, respectively,  though  at  an  earlier  conference  on  mining  machinery  held  in  February 1982, it had been announced that the level of mechanization in state mines would be 50 per cent by 1985 and 95 per cent by 2000. Half of the LS mines were to have 50 per cent mechanization by 2000. 47

Several measures were taken to raise the quantity and technical sophistication of the machinery used in the mines. The Comprehensive Mining Equipment Service Team,  the  first  national  organization  to  service  Chinese-made  comprehensive

mining equipment, was established in April 1980, and in December of that year the China National Coalmine Equipment Service Corporation was established. 48 The latter was to develop, manufacture and sell new equipment, repair equipment, and maintain service stations in all main coal areas for technical services, purchasing, and marketing. 49 At the National Working Conference on Coal Mining Mechanization held in January 1982, it was advocated that the responsibility system be used in the allocation of equipment, that is, that the chief engineers and team leaders have responsibility for the use and care of it, and that a system of leasing be tried. It was resolved that the supply of spare parts would be improved and that the machinery repair plants of the administration or the manufacturers of the equipment would be responsible for overhauling the fully mechanized face equipment, while routine maintenance would be handled by the repair shops of the mines. 50

Ten months later the China National Coal Mining Machinery Manufacturing Corporation was established to oversee the manufacturing, supply, and sale of the products made by the MCI's machinery plants, and to cooperate with local coal mine machinery plants and others belonging to ministries which were producing similar sorts of products. In December 1986 this corporation was disbanded and authority was transferred to lower level machinery manufacturing enterprises. 51

At  a  conference  held  the  following  year,  in  1983,  it  was  estimated  that  the country' s major mines would attain a technical level comparable to what advanced countries had in the late 1970s or early 1980s. 52 Ye Qing, one of the coal industry vice-ministers, made several significant statements about the relationship of mechanization and output at a national meeting in April 1984. He noted that the output from fully mechanized faces was many times higher than from partially mechanized faces, and among the serious problems was the machinery industry' s production of incompatible and inadequate spare parts. 53

In its pursuit of accountability the government instituted the contract responsibility  system  economywide.  Materials  for  production  and  capital  construction under the plan were negotiated in the contracts on the basis of planned output. The bureaux in turn gave quotas to all the mines under their jurisdictions. There were different procedures for goods under the plan and goods not under the plan. Under the terms of the contract, the MCI would guarantee to provide the agreed amount of  the  materials  under  the  plan.  If  an  enterprise  managed  to  meet  the  output target without using all of these materials, a cash reward worth 10 to 20 per cent of the value saved would be given. If, on the other hand, the enterprise had to request further supplies, a penalty of 10 to 20 per cent of the value of the extra materials would be levied. 54

As for materials not under the plan, the enterprises were free to purchase them from the Materials Supply Company of the MCI or from the open market. This Company functioned as a separate economic accounting unit responsible for its own profits and losses. They could also run businesses either independently or jointly with other enterprises that would produce the required materials. 55

At a National Coal Mine Capital Construction Conference in the spring of 1979, four  working  groups  were  established  to  investigate  the  relationship  between

mining and development in state mines. It was discovered that overmining had taken place in ninety-six mines, and in June 1979 at a national mine development conference  delegates  hoped  that  the  output-capacity  ratio  problem  would  be solved within three years. 56

Experiments in the contracting of capital construction work began in thirteen mines in 1981 and soon after another thirty-five were added to the programme. 57 Contracts  were  settled  on  the  basis  of  'Three  Guarantees,  Three Assurances', that is, the engineering units would guarantee the engineering, design budget, and lead time, while the MCI would assure the funding, materials and equipment, and labour. The design documents had to be approved by the SPC for projects with a capacity of over 5 million tons. Unlike in the past when the MCI assigned construction crews for all the projects, the enterprises would now be able to call tenders for the work and arrange the sequence of geological and engineering tasks. They would also determine the number of workers and their wages and benefits, as well as set productivity standards. Payment to the chosen crews would be made using investment funds from the state, but the enterprise could retain any remaining funds and could also use funds left over from the previous year. Heretofore all enterprises had to use any funds given them by the state in exactly the way it was planned for them to be used, and any remaining funds had to be returned. Now, if cost-overruns occurred, the state would not make up the difference. These would be  first  steps  in  the  decentralization  of  control  and  hardening  of  the  budget constraint.

Another change was aimed at assuring accountability. The project manager and the contracted workers would now be subject to evaluation, and to dismissal if they did not meet the standards specified in the contract. In the past their work had not been monitored, with the consequence that it was often poorly done and extended over a far too long time. Included in the 1983 plan for the coal industry was the statement: 'It is required that the average lead time of a new mine be no longer  than  six  years.' 58 Wang Senhao, the former chief engineer of the MCI, writing in an article in 1983, suggested that the lead time be brought down from as many as ten years to five in 1990. 59 In September 1983 at the Conference on Coal Industry Capital Construction Work it was resolved that the coal authorities in each province and autonomous region and all mining bureaux should devise a seven-year capital construction projection.

## Labour

Well  before  1979  it  had  been  recognized  that  worker  productivity  in  the  coal industry was very poor relative to international standards. The main reasons were low pay, no relationship between output and remuneration, and severe overmanning. Soon after the reform programme was launched a series of measures was introduced  to  increase  productivity  in  terms  of  OMS. The  goal  was  set  in  the Sixth Five Y ear Plan to raise it significantly from 0.912 tons in 1980 to 0.965 in 1985, and to over two tons per day in 2000. In 1979 two conferences were held on  reforming  wages  and  bonuses,  and  experimentation  with  the  conference

proposals began at Jinggezhang Mine of the Kailuan Bureau (Hebei) and Xiaonan Mine at the Tiefa Mining Administration in Liaoning. 60 The results of the experiments so pleased the MCI that in 1984 it directed all of the state mines to adopt the changes. Contracts were set with the mining and driving teams and auxiliary groups. A basic wage per ton was to be offered, on top of which was to be added extra wages for above-quota production. According to Shanxi Coal Bureau management representatives, wages for extra output were twice the base wage. 61 For jobs in which the piece-rate system could not be applied, remuneration was to be paid on the basis of responsibility and work points. Bonuses for these workers were to  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  income  generated  by  the  mine  from above-quota  production  or  driving  footage.  Cadres  would  continue  to  receive a  position  allowance. 62 In  order  to  maintain  a  stable  work  force,  there  were several industry-wide increases in average wages, making for a total increase of 54.4  per  cent  in  1984  over  the  1978  level.  For  comparison,  average  industrial wages increased by 56.8 per cent over the same period. Wages in the forest industry  increased by 39.6 per cent, in the textiles industry by 44.6 per cent, in the paper industry by 49.8 per cent, in the smelting industry by 64.7, and in the electric power industry by 72.1. 63

Due to the pre-1979 practice of awarding equal wages based on the total wage bill, there had been no incentive for workers to increase their output, and there had been little if any difference in the wages offered to workers with different skills. Minister Gao Y angwen was aware of both these problems. In an article in Nengyuan (Energy) he wrote:

â¦we must investigate how to make payment better correspond to the work done in order to stabilize the workforce and raise its quality. We must also widen the gap between the pay grades for surface workers and underground workers and for mental and physical work â¦ the wages should be such that everyone will be highly envious of skilled workers' wages. 64

Gao  called  emphatically  for  increasing  the  role  of  trained  scientists  and providing them with improved working conditions, and he gave a great deal of attention to increasing the level of education of the miners. 65 In the late 1970s and early  1980s  the China Coal Industry Yearbooks , Nengyuan (Energy), Meitan kexue jishu (Coal Science and Technology), and the Shanxi ribao (Shanxi Daily) were filled with articles on this subject. One of the twelve development policies of the 1982 comprehensive coal plan was 'to improve technical competency of workers and staff'. Specific targets were: district team leaders or equivalent were to  have  attended  secondary technical school; heads, deputy heads, and department directors were to have college education; and all workers and staff were to have junior middle school by 2000. 66

Overmanning was a recognized problem and steps were taken to reduce the number of employees at all levels. Between February and June 1982 the industry underwent a major restructuring and many offices were either dropped or merged with  others. 67 The  number  of  bureaux  went  from  16  to  14,  departments  were

reduced  from  90  to  63,  and  the  number  of  posts  from  1,043  to  843. 68 Total employment in the industry was reduced by 28.3 per cent. Worker quotas and duty descriptions were defined for each task. 69 Between 1983 and 1985 the work force was further reduced by about half a million.

## Financing

## Towards accountability

In the pre-reform era the coal industry, as did almost all the state owned industries, operated under soft, if indeed any budget constraint. Financial losses were experienced routinely, and just as routinely the central government was forced to give the industry grants and subsidies to keep it functioning. Inadequate investment allocations,  low  fixed  prices  which  often  did  not  cover  current,  far  less keep up with rising production costs, and poor management - no accountability at any level, no profit motive, no market dynamic of any kind - kept the industry in a state of financial inertia. Workers of all ranks knew the government would keep  the  industry  going  no  matter  how  wasteful  and  irrational  the  day-to-day operations.

With  the  beginning  of  the  reforms,  the  MCI  officials  sought  to  reverse  the entrenched  and  languishing  attitudes  of  its  workers  by  introducing  incentives which would not only make each and every worker aware of the costs incurred and the profits/losses made by his unit, but, more importantly, make his earnings directly affected by his unit' s financial performance. A contract system came into effect after trials had been carried out in twenty-two mining administrations in the eastern region. Beginning in 1984 the Ministry of Finance made six-year production contracts with the MCI, which in turn made contracts with the provinces, prefectures, departments, and bureaux. These jurisdictions in turn made contracts with  the  mining  administrations,  which  made  contracts  with  individual  mines. Although the contract was set for six years, that is, up to 1990, the administrations  and  bureaux  themselves  were  to  plan  the  yearly,  monthly,  and  quarterly targets. Each coal producing unit was given an output quota to fulfil by a set date and was to sell the coal to the state at a fixed price for unified distribution.

The two-track pricing system was expanded as an incentive to increased production. Non-state mines had been permitted since about 1972 to sell their coal at market prices. Now, above-quota output that the state mines produced would be sold to the state at 50 per cent (later changed to 70 per cent) above the basic price, or on the open market at a floating price, that is, what the market would bear. 70 Of the profits generated from the coal sales, it was suggested that the enterprises use 50 per cent for maintaining production, 20 per cent for welfare facilities for the staff and workers, 20 per cent for rewards, and 10 per cent for reserve funds. 71 Those units which did not meet the production targets agreed upon in the contract were to make up the difference by buying coal from the markets at the going rate. Besides specifying how much coal would be sold to the state, the contract also set production standards, for example, recovery rates, OMS, and safety requirements.

For its part, the state guaranteed a specified amount of investment funds, materials under unified distribution, and sufficient transportation capacity. If the funds agreed upon in the contract proved inadequate, the enterprises could apply to the MCI for loans at 0.6 per cent. Conversely, if the enterprises did not use all of their allocations, they could lend money to the Ministry at 0.6 per cent. 72 In May 1985, the MCI established its own audit bureau to monitor annually the income and expenditures of all enterprises and institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, and to exert financial discipline on those not under direct MCI control. 73

The contracts included clauses on losses. In order to make up for the difference between  production  costs  and  selling  prices,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  was  to subsidize the industry by 300 million yuan per year between 1985 and 1990. If the enterprises incurred losses beyond those expected, they were to make up for these themselves. If, on the other hand, the losses were less than anticipated, the subsidy was to be shared, with 60 per cent going to the enterprises and 40 per cent to the state. 74

The  reforms  brought  significant  changes  to  the  tax  system,  some  of  them intended to provide the SOEs with greater incentives and others to regulate the new forms of ownership which were emerging. In 1984-85 profit remittances were  changed  to  taxes  and  depreciation  funds  were  placed  under  enterprise control.  The  relevant  Coal  Industry Y earbooks  indicate  that  the  coal  industry received some preferential treatment, for example, the tax rate on coal products was  lowered  from  8  to  3  per  cent, 75 and  individual  plants  within  the  mining administrations  were  no  longer  required  to  turn  over  30  per  cent  of  the  basic depreciation  funds  to  the  central  authorities. 76 What  used  to  be  known  as  the 'industry' and 'commerce' taxes were changed to one 'product' tax, which was to  be  levied  at  the  rate  of  3  per  cent.  Enterprises  making  a  profit  rate  of  over 12 per cent were to pay a 'resource tax' to reduce the financial discrepancy among enterprises. 77

The  funding  allocated  to  the  LNS  mine  sector  was  now  minimized.  It  was decided that the limited financial resources available should be spent on a few key large mines and infrastructure projects, that is, undertakings of a magnitude which the peasants could not handle themselves. Operators of local mines were encouraged to open new mines using whatever resources they themselves could collect and, beginning in 1981, the state annually provided loans of 200 million yuan to assist with the opening of new pits or the expansion of old ones. In 1983 this  was  increased  to  470  million.  Considerable  time  at  the  National Working Conference  of  Locally-Run  Coal  Mines  held  in August-September  1982  was devoted to discussing funding arrangements for local mines. 78 It was decided that sources available to them, apart from the central government were: provincial, prefecture, and county governments; revenue from selling coal directly to other provinces or districts; government subsidies given for transferring coal under the plan; and funds from intra- and inter-provincial joint ventures, bank loans, and foreign funds. It was also decided at the Conference that the coal bureaux at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels must establish their own transport and marketing organizations.

## 126 The industry and Deng's reforms

In June 1985 Premier Zhao Ziyang proposed that 'people power' be relied upon for cutting coal in Shanxi Province and that the state concentrate its investment funds on increasing and upgrading transport and communications, aspects which peasants were not technically or financially capable of doing. In rationalizing this plan he said there were three possible strategies for Shanxi:

- a. to rely on state investment to build large mines which would increase production capacity by twenty million tons. The total estimated cost would be forty billion yuan.
- b. to build large, medium, and small mines simultaneously but put most emphasis on the construction of large mines. This would cost about thirty billion yuan.
- c. to build large, medium, and small mines simultaneously but concentrate on the development of township-run mines. The total estimated cost would be twenty billion yuan including nine billion yuan in state loans. 79

Favouring option (c), he noted that township mines required the least amount of investment, yielded capacity and production increases rapidly, helped economize on the use of state-controlled materials and mining facilities, and helped accelerate the development of the rural economy. The output target for 2000 for Shanxi Province was set at 400 million tons, with 105 million (26.25 per cent) coming from CMAs, 95 million (23.75 per cent) from LS mines, and 200 million (50 per cent) from township mines. He advocated that during the Seventh Five Year Plan no new large state mines be built and that all investment should be put towards the transport and communication sectors. Thus, the resources for the development of the township mines would have to be locally derived. Furthermore, he believed that with the state bearing the entire cost of the construction of the large trunk lines and roads, the masses would be stimulated to build the feeder lines and manage local shipping.

## Pricing

The need for a major economywide reform of prices, including a large increase in coal prices, was generally recognized and reflected in the hundreds of articles written in the early 1980s. 80 Prices were regarded as the crucial lever both to raise coal production and reduce consumption. A fundamental issue was the correct timing and rate of change. Since consumers could not immediately improve their consumption performance by acquiring more efficient equipment, the impact of a price increase in the long run would be quite different from what it would be in the short. One viewpoint held that the first step would be to eliminate losses (by making prices more on par with production costs). The second step would be to increase gradually the capital profit level of the industry by raising the average price three or four times so that the average profit level corresponded to th
