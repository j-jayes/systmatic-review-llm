        PREFACE .
    THE entire absence of a work like the
   present, has long been felt as a serious evil .
   Nothing whatever in the shape of information
    is to be found , except a few pamphlets , the
   productions of party warmth , or of a school
   of political economy , the dogmas of which are
   open to insuperable objections ; whilst the
   vast importance of the subject itself, and the
   numerous interests connected with it , render
    it highly desirable that it should be carefully
   examined and dispassionately considered , —
   and that a book should be the result to which
    all parties may look with confidence , and
   that which the general reader may turn to
   for accurate information .
     It is very true that committees of the House
   of Commons, have at different periods exa-
   mined into some of the points of this inquiry .
                B

```
     It has however unfortunately happened that
     the evidence given before them [,] and the re-
     ports founded upon that evidence , are looked
     at suspiciously, and have in effect no weight
     or consideration . This has arisen , partly from
     the peculiar nature of the evidence[,] which [too]
     often is tinged so strongly with party [spirit][,]
     that it subjects itself at once to doubt [or][ total]
     unbelief ; and partly to the want ofknowledge
     amongst the members ofthe committee [,] which
     prevented them applying such questions and
     trains of reasoning and deductions , as the
     actual condition of the subject demanded .
     Hence , though many valuable facts have been
      elicited by these inquiries , they are in such
     a crude form, as to be entirely valueless [.]
      Connected in no way with manufactures ,
     not having the slightest interest in the[ exist-]
     ence or non-existence of any particular order
     of things, the Author trusts he [shall] [supply] a
     desideratum in literature, and at a juncture ,
     when men's minds are excited upon the
     subject , which is but just beginning to have
     that attention paid it, that its magnitude and
     overwhelming value demand . In the prose-
     cution of his work he has studiously confined
     himself to data, generally the results of exten-
     sive personal research and inquiry, or ob-

   tained from documents worthy of implicit
    belief.
    The questions of infant labour, the effects
   of factory labour in general, the physical con-
   dition and peculiar diseases of the labourers,
   have been treated plainly and succinctly, upon
   considerations drawn from the known consti-
   tution of the human body, and the conse-
   quences produced by various external agencies
   upon its healthy functions . They have been
   discussed with strict impartiality, and freed
   from the misrepresentations and gross exag-
   gerations which have hitherto involved them.
    The moral, social, and domestic relations of
   the immense portion of the productive popu-
   lation of the kingdom, now engaged in manu-
   factures , present a picture, as strange and
   as deeply interesting, as any in the whole
   circle of the history of mankind . To the phi-
   lanthropist to the man anxious for the well-
   being and social happiness of his species- it is
   one calculated to fill the mind with sorrow
   and fear. It has been little attended to, and
    still less understood . Remedies are wanted-
   are loudly called for ; but, before they can be
   efficiently applied , the disease must be stu-
   died ; mere empiricism , even when founded
   on the purest motives, is dangerous ; and when

     the interest and happiness of a multitude are
     at stake , a clear and distinct understanding of
      its wants and failings should precede any at-
     tempt to satisfy the one or rectify the other.
      In developing the existing state of things ,
     with respect to combinations , the truck sys-
     tem , and the cottage system, many important
     truths are brought into full daylight, unper-
     verted in their bearings by the mistaken ideas
     or disingenuousness, sometimes of one party ,
     sometimes of another, which have invariably
     distorted, or partially concealed them , as best
     suited their peculiar purposes . A strenuous
     effort too has been made to demonstrate satis-
     factorily, how much mischief is arising and
     has arisen from a division of interest, and
     want of mutual co-operation between the
     masters and the men .
      In the statistical divisions of this work , the
     Author has done all that a man can do with
     the subject and he can add his mite of vexa-
     tion to that of others who have been engaged
     in similar inquiries . The utter want of any
     thing approaching to correct registration , is
     one of the severest drawbacks to those who
     are wishful to verify their positions by refer-
     ences to figures. All that the utmost industry
     can expect to attain , is but an approximation

    to accuracy, and it may be questioned whether
    it is not safer to rely upon deductions drawn
    from other and better authenticated sources
    of knowledge. The difficulty in these respects
     is increased a hundred-fold in manufacturing
    districts, the population of which is undergo-
    ing such incessant changes, quite independent
    of the operation of natural events, and in
    which too the separatists from the Established
    Church, constitute the numerical majority .
   Many of these keep no registries whatever ;
    and in all so much laxity and uncertainty
    prevail, that they are worse than useless as
    documentary evidence . The immigration of
    families from the surrounding parishes is ano-
    ther difficulty, as it generally happens that an
    individual who has removed not too far from
    the grave of his fathers, is carried away after
    death, to repose in the same quiet nook, re-
    mote from the turmoil and bustle which have
   made his heart yearn for a green and sunny
    resting place.
     The little amount of written information on
    all these subjects , is very extraordinary , espe-
    cially when it is borne in mind how large a
    proportion of the national wealth , and of the
    entire population , are involved in them . This
   may perhaps have arisen from the circum-

    stance of the existing pre-eminence of manu-
    facturers , being but the growth of a day—
    being as yet but a Hercules in the cradle .
    It is indeed only since the introduction of
      1
    steam as a power, that they have acquired
    their paramount importance ; one generation
    even now is but passing away since this epoch ,
    and what mighty alterations has it already
    wrought in the condition of society - chang-
    ing in many respects the very frame-work of
    the social confederacy , and opening into view
    a long vista of rapid transitions , terminating
    in the subjection of human power, as an agent
    of labour, to its gigantic and untiring ener-
    gies
      It is high time that the erroneous opinions
    currently entertained on many points con-
    nected with factory discipline and factory
    labour should be removed ; and that the feel-
    ings ofsympathy and needless commisseration ,
    expressed by certain portions of the commu-
    nity, should be directed into a more legiti-
    mate and less harmful channel . One great
    cause of the unhappy differences which have
    so completely sundered the confidence of the
    employers and the employed , had its origin in
    the want ofdiffusion of correct knowledge. Nei-
    ther have the masters at all times shewn that

   their opinions were trustworthy . But it has
   been the men who have chiefly erred , and

   They have suffered their better judgments to

    The causes which have led to the present

   labourer, earn what is amply sufficient to sup-
   ply all their wants, with the exception of one
   particular class , the hand-loom weavers : it
    is not factory labour, considered per se ; it is
   not the lack of education , in the common
   acceptation of the word : -no ; it has arisen
   from the separation of families , the breaking
   up of households , the disruption of all those
    ties which link man's heart to the better
   portion of his nature , viz . his instincts and

    The deductions and statements in this work ,

    five-ninths of the whole population engaged

        It is much to be wished that " men in high
      places " would examine, somewhat more in
      detail, the existing condition of the manufac-
      turers . The conversion of a great people, in
       little more than the quarter of a century,
      from agriculturists to manufacturers , is a
     phenomenon worthy the attention of any
      statesman. It is an attention, too, which
      will be forced upon them, when , from their
     want of knowledge, they will be liable to take
      steps which may prove destructive to one or
     both of the great divisions of national pro-
      perty. The change, too , which has recently
     been made in the constitution of the House
     of Commons, is another important reason
     why information should be extended widely
     and generally. The change is one, indeed,
      characteristic ofthe times ; and the introduc-
      tion to the House of persons of strictly com-
      mercial habits and views, will necessarily
      operate very powerfully upon the course of

   wealthy nation , are pouring into the tide of
   manufactures, and swelling its ascendency ;
   and it must soon become in appearance, what
   it is in reality, the directing current of the
   national prosperity . From the utter absence
   of information , it is to be feared that crude
   and badly digested enactments may inter-
   fere between the employer and the employed,

   the ultimate endangering of the present lofty

     It is , above all things, of importance that

   fully and maturely considered . Though dan-
   ger may arise from legislative enactments ,

     hand , and steam aided by machinery , which
      is constantly improving in construction , and
     increasing in applicability , is approaching a
      crisis, the termination of which it is frightful
     to contemplate . The contest has hitherto
     been, between the vast body of hand-loom
     weavers , who have clung to their ancient
     habits, till no market is open to their labour ;
     but it is now commencing between another
     great body and machinery . The adaptation
     of mechanical contrivances to nearly all the
     processes which have as yet wanted the deli-
     cate tact of the human hand, will soon either
     do away with the necessity for employing it,
     or it must be employed at a price that will
     enable it to compete with mechanism . This
     cannot be : human power must ever be an ex-
     pensive power ; it cannot be carried beyond a
     certain point, neither will it permit a depres-
     sion of payment below what is essential for
      its existence, and it is the fixing of this
     minimum in which lies the difficulty .
       It may indeed be questioned how [far] [the]
     interference of Government in [questions] of
      this nature is likely to prove beneficial[ ,][ and]
     whether the parties , the masters on the one

  of France once said to Colbert , when it was pro-
  posed to take measures of protection for their
   interests " Laissez nous faire," let us alone,
  we shall take care of ourselves . One thing is
  becoming daily more and more obvious, and
   this is , that the agriculturist in the long run
  has had but little reason to be grateful for the
   protection which has been thrown over him,
  not unfrequently at the expense of other in-
   terests . It would be well if the manufacturers
  would take a lesson from them . The majo-
   rity of representation has hitherto been con-
   nected with landed property, and this has
   enabled the farmer to cover himself with pro-
   tecting duties, and he has availed himself of
   it to the utmost . A single glance at his pre-
   sent condition will clearly show how illusory,
  how fallacious has been his factitious prospe-
   rity, and that the time is come when he feels
  howmiserably all his hopes have been blighted .
  " Laissez nous faire " should be the maxim of
   the manufacturer, or the time will also come
  when he will bitterly repent his clamour for
   legislative protection .

      home market. At this period , and down to 1800 ,
      during which interval, a general impetus had been
      given to this branch of trade by foreign and in-
      creased home consumption-and in which, also,
      great improvements had taken place in the con-
      struction of the machines, all tending to facilitate
      and hasten production-the majority of the arti-
      zans engaged in them had laboured in their own
      houses, and in the bosoms of their families . It
     may be termed the period of domestic manufac-
      ture ; and the various mechanical contrivances
      were expressly framed for this purpose . The
      distaff, the spinning wheel, producing a single
      thread, and , subsequently the mule and jenny,
     were to be found forming a part of the comple-
     ment of household furniture , in almost every
      house of the districts in which they were carried
     on, whilst the cottage every where resounded with
      the clack of the hand-loom
       These were, undoubtedly, the golden times of
      manufactures , considered in reference to the cha-
      racter of the labourers . By all the processes
      being carried on under a man's own roof, he re-
      tained his individual respectability ; he was kept
      apart from associations that might injure his
      moral worth , whilst he generally earned wages
     which were sufficient not only to live comfortably
     upon, but which enabled him to rent a few
      acres of land ; thus joining in his own person
     two classes, that are now daily becoming more
     and more distinct. It cannot , indeed , be denied ,

```

    that his farming was too often slovenly, and was
    conducted at times but as a subordinate occupa-
    tion ; and that the land yielded but a small
    proportion of what, under a better system of
    culture , it was capable of producing. It never-
    theless answered an excellent purpose . Its neces-
    sary tendence filled up the vacant hours , when he
    found it unnecessary to apply himself to his loom
    or spinning machine . It gave him employment of
    a healthy nature , and raised him a step in the
    scale of society above the mere labourer . A gar-
    den was likewise an invariable adjunct to the
    cottage of the hand-loom weaver ; and in no part
    of the kingdom were the floral tribes , fruits , and
    edible roots, more zealously or more successfully
    cultivated .
    The domestic manufacturers generally resided
    in the outskirts of the large towns , or at still more
    remote distances . Themselves cultivators , and
    of simple habits and few wants , the uses of tea,
    coffee, and groceries in general, but little known ,
    they rarely left their own homestead . The yarn
    which they spun , and which was wanted by the
   weaver, was received or delivered , as the case
   might be, by agents , who travelled for the whole-
    sale houses ; or depôts were established in parti-
    cular neighbourhoods , to which he could apply at
   weekly periods . Grey-haired men-fathers of
    large families , have thus lived through a long
    life, which has been devoted to spinning or weav-
    ing, and have never entered the precincts of a

    in their means of support, they have gone there ,
     for the first time , when forced to migrate with
     their households , in search of occupation at steam-
    looms.
     Thus, removed from many of those causes
    which universally operate to the deterioration of
    the moral character of the labouring man , when
     brought into large towns- into immediate contact
    and communion with his fellows , and under the
     influence of many depressing physical agencies-
     the small farmer , spinner , or hand-loom weaver,
     presented as orderly and respectable an appear-
     ance as could be wished . It is true that the
    amount of labour gone through, was but small ;
     that the quantity of cloth or yarn produced was
     but limited- for he worked by the rule of his
     strength and convenience . They were , however,
     sufficient to clothe and feed himself and family
     decently, and according to their station ; to lay
    by a penny for an evil day, and to enjoy those
     amusements and bodily recreations then in being.

     and impure atmosphere, the fumes of the gin-

    shop, the low debauchery of the beer-house, and
    the miseries incident to ruined health . On the
    contrary, he commonly lived to a good round age,
    worked when necessity demanded , ceased his
    labour when his wants were supplied , according
    to his character, and if disposed to spend time or
    money in drinking , could do so in a house as well
    conducted and as orderly as his own ; for the
    modern weaver or spinner differs not more widely
    from the domestic manufacturer, than the publi-
    can ofthe present day, differs from the Boniface of
     that period , whose reputation depended upon
    good ale and good hours, and who , in nine cases
    out of ten, was a freeholder of some consequence
    in the neighbourhood .
     The circumstance of a man's labour being con-
    ducted in the midst of his household , exercised a
    powerful influence upon his social affections , and
    those of his offspring . It but rarely happened that
    labour was prematurely imposed upon these ; ——
     his own earnings, aided by the domestic econo-
   my of his wife, generally sufficing to permit
    growth and bodily development to be, to some
    extent, completed, before any demand was made
    upon their physical energies . This permitted and
    fostered the establishment of parental authority
    and domestic discipline . It directed the child's
    thoughts and attachments to their legitimate ob-
    jects , and rendered it submissive to that control
    which is essential to its future welfare . When it
    was enabled to join its exertions to those of its

      parent for their mutual support, it did so with no
      idea of separate interests , but with a free acknow-
      ledgment that the amount of its earnings was en-
      tirely at the disposal of the head of the family.
     Thus remaining and labouring in conjunction with ,
      and under the eye of, its parents , till manhood
      and womanhood were respectively attained , it ac-
      quired habits of domestication , exceedingly fa-
      vourable to its subsequent progress through life ;
     home being, to the poor man, the very temple of
      fortune, in which he may contrive, if his earnings
      are not scanty indeed , to live with comfort and
      independence .
       In this respect, the child of the domestic ma-
      nufacturer was advantageously placed . It re-
     mained under its paternal roof during the period
      in which puberty was developed ; its passions and
      social instincts were properly cultivated , its bo-
      dily powers were not too early called into requi-
      sition, it had the benefit of green fields , a pure at-
     mosphere, the cheering influences of nature , and
       its diet was plain and substantial . Under these
      auspicious circumstances it grew vigorously, ac-
      quired a healthy tone of system , the various parts
      of its physical organization were well compacted
      and arranged , and it presented an aspect fresh
     and blooming, speaking of animal energy and
      vital activity, and evincing that with it every thing
     went well, and that it enjoyed and profited by
     them .

     guarantees for the performance of the relative du-
      ties of all classes, were at this time in full force ;
     and the ' Squire , ' as the chief landed proprietor
     was generally termed, obtained and deserved his
     importance from his large possessions , low rents ,
     and a simplicity and homeliness of bearing which ,
     when joined to acknowledged family honours , made
     him loved and reverenced by his tenants and neigh-
     bours. He mingled freely with their sports-
     was the general and undisputed arbitrator in all
     questions of law and equity- was a considerate
     and generous landlord --a kind and indulgent mas-
      ter-and looking at him in all his bearings , a
     worthy and amiable man ; tinged , it is true , with
     some vices , but all so coated over with wide-
     spreading charity, that the historian willingly
     drawsthe veil offorgetfulness over them . This race
     of men is now nearly extinct in the manufactur-
     ing districts. Their possessions are passed into
     new hands- their descendants " pushed from their
      stools" by an order of men having few or no traits in
     common with them . They indeed belonged to a
     race indigenous to a peculiar grade of social ad-
     vancement, no longer in being. With them, for
     they were equally a part of the same system , the
     " Yeomanry of England ;" the small farmers have
      fallen victims to the breaking up of a condition
     of society, and a state of property, which secured a
      flourishing rural population . The few old relics of
     the squirearchy which are still now and then to be
     found in these districts , are but mementos of a

       race gone by- are like the scathed oak of another
       generation , withering in the midst of a thriving
      and usurping plantation , which has derived its
       birth and part of its sustenance from its decay, and
      which is rapidly sinking or already sunk below
       the level of the mass that surrounds it.
        Modern intellectual utilitarians measure men's
       actions, and every thing referring to his condition ,
      by mere mind . That state of things is, however,
      the best which brings to each man's fireside the
       greatest amount of domestic comforts , though it
      may not be that which will enable him to boil his
       pot scientifically, or calculate an abstruse problem
       in mathematics . It is not denied , neither is it
      wished to conceal the fact from observation , that
       squire, yeoman, and manufacturer differed very
       materially in some of these respects from the in-
       dividuals occupying a correspondent rank at the
      present period, and that the latter, when looked
      upon in this point of view, are infinitely superior
      to the former. Neither in comparing the two is
      there any intention of wishing that the state of
       society should be again taken back to that parti-
       cular level in the onward progress of civilization .
       It would be vain and childish to do so . The for-
      ward impulse must and will be obeyed , whatever
      the consequences may be to the welfare and hap-
      piness of the labouring community. On the one
      hand may be seen a daily spread of knowledge,
      joined to a gradual depression in the scale of so-
       cial enjoyments ; vast and incessant improvements

     in mechanical contrivances , all tending to over-
     match and supersede human labour, and which
     threatens, ere long , to extirpate the very demand
     for it ; a system of toil continued unbroken by rest
     or relaxation , for fourteen or sixteen hours , in a
     heated and crowded mill , and an utter destruction
     of all social and domestic relations ; on the other
     hand, a calm and equable flow of occupation , al-
     ternating between the loom and the greensward-
     an intelligence seldom looking beyond present
     means—an ignorance of nearly every but the
     most common arts of life- a knowledge chiefly tra-
     ditional a proper station inthe social arrangement,
     a demand for labour full as great, if not greater
     than the existing supply - a rate of wage quite
     equivalent to the simplicity and limited range of
     their wants , and all the social and domestic relations
     in full force , and properly directed . The great
     question here is the measure of social and domes-
      tic happiness , for these are but synonymes of
     social virtue . They co -exist and have an inti-
     mate dependence one upon another . Degradation
     in these conditions will ever be simultaneous with
     moral declension-a declension incompatible with
     the performance of a great majority of man's best.
     and most sacred duties.
      If the comfort of the poor man is to be esti-
     mated by variety of wants , by his living in an
      artificial state of society , surrounded by all the
     inventions resulting from a high degree of civili-

      every facility afforded him for procuring them..--
      the aboriginal and home manufacturer sinks very
      low when compared with the present race. If, on
      the contrary, comfort and domestic happiness
      are to be judged by the fewness of a man's
      wants , with the capability of securing the means
       for their supply, the tables are turned in favour
      of the domestic manufacturer. If the comfort
      of these states of society is to be calculated upon
      another ground--namely, the nature of their
      separate wants and habits --it brings into light
      very striking contrasts . The present manufacturer
      shows a high order of intelligence , seeking its
      amusement in the newspaper, the club , the poli-
       tical union , the lecture room ; looking for its
      stimulus in the gin and beer shops ; for its sup-
      port a limited supply of animal food , once a day,
      joined with copious dilution of weak tea, the
      almost universal concomitant of the spinner and
      weaver's breakfast and evening meal, in many
      cases indeed being nearly its sole constituent ;
      debarred from all athletic sports, or rather not
      having a moment's time to seek , or a bodily
      vigour capable of undertaking them ; an active
      mind in a stunted and bloodless body ; a sepa-
       ration of the labourer from his family during the
      whole day, and a consequent disruption of all
       social ties , and this too joined to a similar separa-
      tion amongst the various members of his house-
      hold . The domestic manufacturer possessed a
      very limited degree of information ; his amuse

   ments were exclusively sought in bodily exercise ,
   the dance , quoits , cricket, the chace, the numerous
   seasonal celebrations , &c .; an utter ignorance of
    printed books, beyond the thumbed Bible and a
   few theological tracts ; seeking his stimulus in
   home-brewed ale ; having for his support animal
   food occasionally, but living generally upon farm
   produce, meal or rye bread, eggs, cheese , milk,
    butter, &c. ; * the use of tea quite unknown , or
    * The sturdy opposition given to the introduction of tea, by
    many of the class of yeomen, is strikingly illustrated by an
    anecdote connected with an ancestor of the author. This man,
    a respectable landowner and tanner, had, like many others, a
    wife strongly disposed to have her own way . When the use
    of tea first became general, she procured a set of the fairy tea-
    cups and huge silver tea-spoons then in vogue, and got some
    tea. Many and serious altercations took place between the
    worthy couple in consequence ; the husband steadily refusing
    what he emphatically denominated stuff, and threatening once
    and again to demolish the whole paraphernalia if she persisted in
    bringing it into daylight. However, the good woman and one
    or two of her neighbours had made the notable discovery that
     it was a beverage singularly fitted to sit and gossip over. On
    one particular day the husband had been more than usually
    furious, and she thought it prudent to beat a partial retreat,
    but by no means to give up the matter. She was for effecting
    this by expediting the hour of tea- drinking, so that all should
    be over before he came to his evening meal. It so happened
    that on this precise day, she had with her one of her gossips ;
    and during their tea-drinking, by some unlucky chance,
    Thomas, for such was his name, was heard clattering his thick-
     soled shoes over the rough pavement before the door, and evi-
    dently coming in. All was hurry to conceal her disobedience
    to his express commands, and this they believed they had
     effectually compassed by thrusting tray and tea-things upon a
     stair-head leading to a sort of lumber room, a place which he
    seldom visited . As fate would have it, he entered and bent

      parent for their mutual support , it did so with no
      idea of separate interests , but with a free acknow-
     ledgment that the amount of its earnings was en-
      tirely at the disposal of the head of the family.
     Thus remaining and labouring in conjunction with ,
     and under the eye of, its parents , till manhood
     and womanhood were respectively attained , it ac-
      quired habits of domestication , exceedingly fa-
      vourable to its subsequent progress through life ;
     home being, to the poor man , the very temple of
      fortune , in which he may contrive , if his earnings
      are not scanty indeed , to live with comfort and
     independence .
       In this respect , the child of the domestic ma-
      nufacturer was advantageously placed . It re-
     mained under its paternal roof during the period
      in which puberty was developed ; its passions and
      social instincts were properly cultivated , its bo-
      dily powers were not too early called into requi-
      sition , it had the benefit of green fields , a pure at-
     mosphere, the cheering influences of nature, and
       its diet was plain and substantial. Under these
      auspicious circumstances it grew vigorously, ac-
      quired a healthy tone of system, the various parts
      of its physical organization were well compacted
     and arranged , and it presented an aspect fresh
     and blooming, speaking of animal energy and
      vital activity, and evincing that with it every thing
     went well , and that it enjoyed and profited by
     them .

     and the Squire ,' as the chief landed proprietor
     was generally termed , obtained and deserved his
     importance from his large possessions , low rents ,
     and a simplicity and homeliness of bearing which ,
     when joined to acknowledged family honours , made
     him loved and reverenced by his tenants and neigh-
     bours. He mingled freely with their sports-
     was the general and undisputed arbitrator in all
     questions of law and equity- was a considerate
     and generous landlord --a kind and indulgent mas-

     worthy and amiable man ; tinged , it is true , with
     some vices, but all so coated over with wide-
     spreading charity, that the historian willingly
     drawsthe veil offorgetfulness over them . This race
     of men is now nearly extinct in the manufactur-
     ing districts . Their possessions are passed into
     new hands- their descendants " pushed from their
      stools" by an order of men having few or no traits in

     race indigenous to a peculiar grade of social ad-
     vancement, no longer in being . With them , for
     they were equally a part of the same system , the

      fallen victims to the breaking up of a condition
     of society , and a state of property , which secured a
      flourishing rural population . The few old relics of

      race gone by- are like the scathed oak of another
      generation , withering in the midst of a thriving
      and usurping plantation , which has derived its
      birth and part of its sustenance from its decay, and
      which is rapidly sinking or already sunk below
      the level of the mass that surrounds it.
       Modern intellectual utilitarians measure men's
      actions , and every thing referring to his condition[ ,]
      by mere mind. That state of things is, however ,
      the best which brings to each man's fireside the
      greatest amount of domestic comforts[ ,] though[ it]
     may not be that which will enable him to [boil][ his]
      pot scientifically, or calculate an abstruse problem
      in mathematics . It is not denied , neither is it
      wished to conceal the fact from observation [,] that
      squire, yeoman , and manufacturer differed very
      materially in some of these respects from the[ in-]
      dividuals occupying a correspondent rank at the
      present period , and that the latter, when looked
      upon in this point of view, are infinitely superior
      to the former. Neither in comparing the two is
      there any intention of wishing that the [state] [of]
      society should be again taken back to that parti-
      cular level in the onward progress of civilization[ .]
      It would be vain and childish to do so [.] The for-
      ward impulse must and will be obeyed[ ,] whatever
      the consequences may be to the welfare and [hap-]
      piness of the labouring community . On the one

     in mechanical contrivances , all tending to over-
    match and supersede human labour, and which
     threatens , ere long , to extirpate the very demand
     for it ; a system of toil continued unbroken by rest
     or relaxation , for fourteen or sixteen hours , in a
     heated and crowded mill , and an utter destruction
     of all social and domestic relations ; on the other
     hand, a calm and equable flow of occupation , al
     ternating between the loom and the greensward—
     an intelligence seldom looking beyond present
     means an ignorance of nearly every but the
     most common arts of life-a knowledge chiefly tra-
     ditional a proper station inthe social arrangement,
     a demand for labour full as great , if not greater
     than the existing supply -- a rate of wage quite
     equivalent to the simplicity and limited range of
     their wants , and all the social and domestic relations
     in full force, and properly directed . The great
     question here is the measure of social and domes-
      tic happiness , for these are but synonymes of
     social virtue. They co -exist and have an inti-
     mate dependence one upon another. Degradation
     in these conditions will ever be simultaneous with
     moral declension-a declension incompatible with
     the performance of a great majority of man's best
     and most sacred duties .

     mated by variety of wants , by his living in an

       every facility afforded him for procuring them..-
       the aboriginal and home manufacturer sinks very
      low when compared with the present race. If, on
       the contrary , comfort and domestic happiness
       are to be judged by the fewness of a man's
      wants , with the capability of securing the means
       for their supply, the tables are turned in favour
       of the domestic manufacturer. If the comfort
       of these states of society is to be calculated upon
       another ground--namely, the nature of their
       separate wants and habits--it brings into light
       very striking contrasts. The present manufacturer
      shows a high order of intelligence , seeking its
      amusement in the newspaper, the club , the poli-
        tical union , the lecture room ; looking for its
       stimulus in the gin and beer shops ; for its sup-
       port a limited supply of animal food , once a day,
       joined with copious dilution of weak tea, the
       almost universal concomitant of the spinner and
       weaver's breakfast and evening meal, in many
       cases indeed being nearly its sole constituent ;
       debarred from all athletic sports, or rather not
       having a moment's time to seek, or a bodily
       vigour capable of undertaking them ; an active
      mind in a stunted and bloodless body ;1 a sepa-
       ration of the labourer from his family during the
       whole day, and a consequent disruption of all
       social ties , and this too joined to a similar separa-
       tion amongst the various members of his house-
       hold . The domestic manufacturer possessed a
       very limited degree of information ; his amuse

    ments were exclusively sought in bodily exercise, *
    the dance, quoits , cricket , the chace , the numerous
    seasonal celebrations , &c .; an utter ignorance of
     printed books, beyond the thumbed Bible and a
    few theological tracts ; seeking his stimulus in
    home-brewed ale ; having for his support animal
    food occasionally, but living generally upon farm
    produce, meal or rye bread , eggs , cheese, milk,
    butter, &c. ;* the use of tea quite unknown , or
      * The sturdy opposition given to the introduction of tea, by
    many of the class of yeomen, is strikingly illustrated by an
     anecdote connected with an ancestor of the author. This man ,
     a respectable landowner and tanner, had, like many others, a
     wife strongly disposed to have her own way . When the use
     of tea first became general , she procured a set of the fairy tea-
     cups and huge silver tea-spoons then in vogue, and got some
     tea. Many and serious altercations took place between the
     worthy couple in consequence ; the husband steadily refusing
     what he emphatically denominated stuff, and threatening once
     and again to demolish the whole paraphernalia if she persisted in
     bringing it into daylight. However, the good woman and one
     or two of her neighbours had made the notable discovery that
      it was a beverage singularly fitted to sit and gossip over . On
     one particular day the husband had been more than usually
     furious, and she thought it prudent to beat a partial retreat,
     but by no means to give up the matter. She was for effecting
     this by expediting the hour of tea- drinking, so that all should
     be over before he came to his evening meal . It so happened
     that on this precise day, she had with her one of her gossips ;
     and during their tea-drinking, by some unlucky chance,
     Thomas, for such was his name, was heard clattering his thick-
      soled shoes over the rough pavement before the door, and evi-
     dently coming in. All was hurry to conceal her disobedience
     to his express commands, and this they believed they had
      effectually compassed by thrusting tray and tea-things upon a
      stair-head leading to a sort of lumber room, a place which he
     seldom visited . As fate would have it, he entered and bent

      on under his own roof, or, if exchanged at inter-
       vals for farming occupation , this was going on
      under the eye of, and with the assistance of his
       family ; his children growing up under his im-
      mediate inspection and control ; no lengthened
       separation taking place till they married , and
      became themselves heads of families ; engaged in
       pursuits similar to his own , and in a subordi-
       nate capacity ; and lastly, the same genera-
       tion living age after age on the same spot , and
      under the same thatched roof, which thus became
      a sort of heir-loom , endeared to its occupier
      by a long series of happy memories and home
       delights-being in fact looked on as an old and
       familiar friend ; and in the end, crowding the same
      narrow tenement in the quiet and sequestered

      balmy, and the uncontaminated breath of heaven .
       One circumstance exceedingly favourable to the
      development and continuance of industry and
       temperance, was the plan, now nearly if not quite

       expected nothing less than to have to bewail the utter destruc-

       them, came back , said not a word, and shortly afterwards be-

   exploded , of leasing small farms for one or more
   lives . A man's character always aided him very
   materially in these arrangements with his land-
   lord , as upon this depended the amount both of
   rent and fine , a respectable man , it being well
   known, not being likely to exhaust and impo-
   verish the land during his interest in it . Number-
   less examples might be quoted in illustration of
   this position, and many circumstances detailed
   showing what a beneficial influence resulted from
    it, upon the tone and bearing of the manners of
   the small farmers . They were indeed a highly
   creditable body of men- priding themselves alike
   on the good opinion of their landlord , the exce!-
   lent condition of their farms , and the quality of
   their yarn or cloth .
    The social virtues it has been said will be found
   pari passu with social comforts . The vices that
   were incident to this state of things were the re-
   sult of man's natural propensities , and depended
   more upon the want of any sufficient check upon
   his passions , which were kept in a state of excite-
   ment by health and bodily vigour, than upon
   moral depravity springing from intentional and
   reiterated wrong doing. The very fact of these
   small communities , (for they were generally found
   congregated in petty irregular villages, contain-
   ing from ten to forty cottages , ) being as it were ,
   one great family, prevented , except in a few ex-
   traordinary instances , any systematic course of

       ful in hindering the commission of crime , aided
     by a sense of religion very commonly existing
      amongst them. In one respect this failed however
      --and it was in preventing the indulgence ofsexual
      appetite , in a way and at a time which are still
      blots upon the rural population of many districts .
       Some surprise may be excited probably by the
       assertion , in those whose attention has never been
      directed to the subject , but it is not the less true ,
      that sexual intercourse was almost universal prior
      to marriage in the agricultural districts . This in-
      tercourse must not be confounded with that pro-
      miscuous and indecent concourse of the sexes
      which is so prevalent in towns, and which is
      ruinous alike to health and to morals . It existed
      only between parties where a tacit understanding
      had all the weight of an obligation- and this was ,
      that marriage should be the result . This , in
      nineteen cases out of twenty , took place sooner or
      later ; but still the prevalence of such a course of
      indulgence was in some respect decidedly inju-
      rious to the character and habits of both indivi-
      duals ; weakening, as it inevitably did , that confi-
      dence which ought to exist between unmarried
      parties , and divesting woman of that chaste and
      pure influence which is capable of keeping in
      check man's coarser and more vehement passions .
     Many of the sports of the period , amongst the
     young of both sexes , were obviously intended to
      facilitate and give opportunities to familiarities of
      the closest kind , and were carried on under the

   guidance of some old crone whose directions go-
   verned the apparent conduct of the females upon
   these singular occasions . Many curious laws are
    still in being orally, which throw strong light on
   the social habits of these children of nature down
   to a very recent period .
    It may be urged that an argument is thus af-
   forded for condemning a system, having as a part
   of its institutions , or at least if not acknowledged
   as such, holding out a sufferance for grossness and
   sensuality alike repudiated by public decency
   and private morality. The force of this is at
   once lost when it is known that such a state of
   things was avowed , and admitted as forming an
   integral portion of their habits . Morality consists
   not so much in particular laws , applicable to
   generals, as upon particular customs , binding par-
   ticular communities , in which every separate
   member does that which is done by his neighbour ,
   and in which all share alike the good or evil of
   them . It would be as unjust to bring forward a
   charge of licentiousness and immorality founded
   upon this fact, against the primitive manufacturer
   and agriculturist, as it would be to condemn as
   immoral the customs of other nations, many of
   the habits of half civilized countries , and nearly
   the whole of those of savage tribes . They do not
   acknowledge nor understand the conventional
   laws, which form the code of morals now in being,
   and are not , therefore , amenable to decisions
   founded upon them . The labouring population

      at the period here indicated , did not possess that
      high tone of public decency, which the advance
      of refinement has since developed . It must ,
      therefore, be judged leniently in these respects ,
      and not condemned as sinning greatly, because
      wanting a certain fastidiousness of manners .
      Man is nevertheless a rational creature , and the
      more he governs himself by the dictates of reason ,
      the nearer he undoubtedly approaches to moral
      perfection . His destiny was never meant to be
      that of a mere animal, nor was it intended that
      his happiness should depend upon the gratifica-
      tion of his appetites. Unlimited or unrestrained
      indulgence of sexual desire in early life , is pre-
      judicial equally to the tone of body and mind ,
      and it is much to be wished , that the custom here
      alluded to was eradicated and totally forgotten .
     Bad as its effects were , and are still , they sink into
      utter insignificance, when compared to the condi-
      tion of the present manufacturing population in
      these respects, the consideration of which forms a
      subsequent portion of this work.
      The moralist, though he may condemn and de-
      claim against this , as being at variance with his
      peculiar ideas , will , if just , attach no farther blame
      than by saying- it was the error of a system belong-
      ing to one stage of civilization . But the philanthro-
      pist, the man who , free from morbid sensibilities ,
      views and judges the manners and customs of
      states in relation only to the happiness of the
      existing race, will lament- that intellectual excel-

   to home and domestic duties , which in no small
   degree served as their atonements.
    The mischief produced by this means was ,
   however, of small amount . This premature inter-
   course occurred , as has been before stated , gene-
    rally between parties, when a tacit though bind-
   ing understanding existed . Its promiscuousness
   seldom went further. So binding was this en-
   gagement, that the examples of desertion were
   exceedingly rare-though marriage was generally
   deferred till pregnancy fully declared itself. *
     * Poor laws Commission. " I appeal to the experience of
    all overseers in rural districts, whether instances of marriage
    taking place among the labouring classes are not so very rare

    the condition of the domestic manufacturer, prior
    to the introduction of steam as an antogonist to
    human power ; and a brief review of these will
    form an interesting and curious feature in the
    history of manufactures, and illustrate the great
    changes which the last forty years have sufficed
    to operate in the circumstances and character of
    those engaged in them . It is singular how little
    attention has been as yet paid to this subject .
   A complete revolution has been affected in the
    distribution of property, the very face of a great
    country has been re-modelled , various classes of
     its inhabitants utterly swept away, the habits of
    all have undergone such vast alterations, that they
    resemble a people of a different age and genera-
    tion ; and yet little has been said , and still less
    written upon them ; and an epoch which has re-
    volutionized and changed a great nation , has been
    going on, without any examination of its precur-
    sory events, or its ulterior influences .
     The distaff and spinning-wheel , producing a
    single thread , were for a long time the only me-
    thods of spinning . About the middle ofthe last cen-
    tury, the demand for cloth was so much increased ,
    that the inventive faculties of those interested in
    it were called into activity, and improved ma-
    chines for spinning were very soon the result .
    Some of the contrivers of the most important im-
    provements failed to demonstrate for a while, the
    value of their discoveries ; others were driven by
    a cruel and ill -judged persecution , to carry their

      knowledge to other countries . A narrow and
       prejudiced view was taken by the public at large,
       and little encouragement given for a time, to those
      who have in the end proved themselves the great-
       est benefactors to their country. In the teeth of
        all these impediments , the pressing demand for
       cloth gradually forced the domestic manufacturer
       to the adoption of improved modes of spinning ;
       for the difficulty had always lain in producing an
       adequate supply of materials in a state fit for the
       loom . One half the weaver's time had generally
       to be spent in waiting for work . This state of
       things was however remedied by the mule and the
       jenny, both of which enabled the spinner to pro-
       duce a greatly increased quantity of yarn , when
       compared to that formerly supplied by the wheel.
        The hand-loom weaver was of course greatly
       benefited by all these improvements , without any
       extra outlay of capital-the loom which sufficed
       to weave a small amount, being of equal efficiency
       to turn out a greater. The call for more cloth ,
       and the facilities given in the first processes, re-
      moved him from the vaccilating and uncertain
       conditions in which he was before placed .
      A family of four adult persons , with two chil-
       dren as winders , earned at the end of the last and
       at the commencement of the present century,
        41. per week, when working ten hours per day ;
      when work was pressed they could of course earn
       more-a single weaver having been known to earn
       upwards of two pounds per week. This however

    required great industry, and was by no means
   common ; weaving too , when thus exercised , is
   not easy labour ; the position in which the weaver
    sits is not the best for muscular exertion , having
    no firm support for his feet , which are alternately
    raised and depressed in working the treddles. He
   has thus to depend for a fulcrum, chiefly on the
   muscles of his back, which are kept in constant
   and vigorous action- while one order of muscles is
   employed with little power of variation , in moving
   the shuttle and beam . These processes when
    carried on for many successive hours , are very
    wearying, and the exertion required becomes after
    a while laborious . The weaver who worked hard
    therefore, actually toiled- a condition widely dif-
    ferent from that of the steam-loom weaver.
    One of the first effects of the constant demand
   upon the labour of the weaver, resulting from a
   more extensive and permanent supply of yarn ,
   was the gradual abandonment of farming as an
    accessary, which had been very common with the
   more respectable portion of the weavers . His
    labour, when employed on his loom , was more
    profitable, and more immediate in its return , than
   when devoted to agricultural pursuits . This ne-
    cessarily led to the introduction of a new order of
    farm tenants, men who exclusively devoted them-
    selves to the cultivation of the soil , who looked to
    its produce as their only mode of acquiring the
   means of support, and who , in nine cases out
    of ten, were mere holders at will- a lowering

       in respectabilty, which it is probable will be
       scarcely understood by those who are not familiar
      with the feeling and grades of rank in this class ,
       or labourers .
        This change in the weavers occupation , pro-
      duced very considerable influence upon him in a
       social point of view. It decidedly tended to lower
       his rank and character, by making him a simple
       labourer, and removing him from that which did
       then , and which still does confer rural distinction , -
       the holding or possessing land . This had formerly
      brought himself and children partially upon the
      same level with the small freeholder or yeoman ,
       properly so called . It also brought him into con-
       tact with this order of men on many occasions ,-
      and remotely, it is true, but still near enough to
       benefit him , it assimulated his condition with that
       of the gentry of the neighbourhood : it gave him
      an honest pride in his capacity, heightened the
      tone of his general character, and was thus mo-
       rally beneficial to him .
       The great body of hand - loom weavers had at all
       periods been divided , by a well defined line of de-
       marcation , into two very distinct classes . This
       division arose from the circumstance of their
      being landholders , being entirely dependant
      upon weaving for their support. It has been
      seen that the weaver, who was also a small
      farmer, lost something by the increase in the de-
      mand for cloth , while, from the same cause , the
       simple weaver, who had all along depended upon

   that demand , gained a step in advance , and now
   found himself on an equality with those who had
   hitherto been his superiors .
    The secondary, or inferior class of artizans , had
   at all times been great sufferers from the impos-
    sibility of supplying themselves with materials for
   their labour. Considerable vacations were fre-
   quently occurring in this respect , and at these
   periods they underwent very severe privations .
   This irregularity had produced its usual effects
   upon their industrial character, rendering them
   improvident, devoid of fore-thought , and careless
   in their expenditure . Not being able to calculate ,
   had they been so disposed, upon the certainty
   that their exertions would be invariably called for,
   they became indifferent , enjoyed the good whilst
    it lasted , and starved through the interval as they
   best might.
     It is an indisputable fact , that irregularity in
   the demand for labour, from whatever cause it
   may arise, by occasionally throwing the workmen
   out of employ, and generating idle habits , is one
   ofthe most disorganizing and degrading influences
   which canbe brought to bear upon their character .
   Independently of the diminished rate of wages ,
   and the acrimonious and suspicious feeling which,
   of late years , have sprung up between the masters
   and men, the stoppages which have taken place
   in nearly all the mills in rotation , for periods more
   or less protracted , sometimes from the fault of one
   party, sometimes of another , have been full as in-

      or as they may well be termed during the pros-
      perous days of hand -manufacture-- the aristocracy
      of manufacturers , was undergoing changes still
      greater and more rapid than that of the weavers ,
      and passing through a revolution which modified
      the whole body , and terminated finally in the ruin
      of the greater portion.
       In the early times of manufacturing , the spinner
      and the weaver were to some extent synonymous
      -so far indeed , that the processes were carried on
      under the same roof, and by the same individuals ;
      the distaff, the wheel, and the loom being all
       called into requisition by a single family.
       At a later period , when improvements in [ma-]
      chinery progressed rapidly[,] stimulated [as] [they]
      were by the inability constantly felt to supply [the]
      demand for yarn , and as these improved machines
       at each step became more bulky[,] more compli-
      cated, and consequently more expensive -a[ divi-]
       sion began to shew itself between the weaver
      and spinner, --the latter throwing aside his wheel
      and devoting himself to the loom[,] [trusting][ to] [ex-]
       ternal sources for his yarn , from a growing [inabi-]
       bility to purchase such machinery as would
      enable him to spin profitably- and the [former][ de-]
       serting the loom, and applying his funds to [pro-]
      cure the best and most recent contivances for
       spinning, knowing as he did that a market [was]
      always open to his produce [.]
       At this period, that is at the time when spin-
      ning was become a separate branch, and when

```

   the division between the two bodies was well
   defined, the spinners were joined by another[ class]
   of persons, who had heretofore held aloof, from
   manufacture-and this was the yeoman-the [male]
    freeholder now nearly extinct as a part of the
    social confederacy.
    The yeoman had lived generation after gene-
   ration upon his patrimonial acres- rarely increa-
   sing their extent and quite as rarely lessening
   them . He had , however, failed to keep pace with
   the onward march of events-had confined him-
    self to cultivating his land precisely in the same
   way in which it had been cultivated by his fore-
    fathers-viewed all innovations as rank heresy ,
   vegetated upon his natal soil , profiting either it
   or the world but little ; but having , notwithstand-
   ing many points about him of real value . He
   was strictly honest in all his dealings-though
   almost universally improvident, more , however,
   from want of mental energy and forethought,
    than from actual extravagance- contented with his
    lot , and a kind and hearty neighbour- but utterly
    unable to cope with the crisis which was opening
   upon him . He had hitherto been surrounded by
    petty farmers-who had generally eked out their
    bad management as cultivators by being weavers,
    and who had served him as bulwarks or break-
    waters against the impending storm . These were
    one by one removed , and their places imme-
    diately occupied by a race of men who gave a
    considerably increased rent, and who by im-

     proved modes of husbandry, and by wringing
     from the soil all it could possibly yield, soon
     drove the small proprietor from the markets
     which he had so long supplied . Thus pressed
     upon by superior industry , and an activity with
     which he could not compete , the yeoman was
     driven to embark some portion of his means
     iu the purchase of spinning machines, and before
     very long, great quantities of yarn were produced
    by the inmates of old farm -houses, in which pre-
     viously the most sluggish inertness had prevailed .
      Nothing can more clearly shew how very im-
     perfectly this class had used its resources, than the
     fact, that five -sevenths of those who purchased
     these machines were obliged to have recourse to
     a loan, generally a mortgage , to raise the money.
      The price of the mere complicated spinning
     machines was very considerable, and it has been
     seen removed them out of the reach of the infe-
      rior class of weavers. This , aided by other causes
     already noticed , brought the small freeholder into
     the field . At the same time monied men began
     to turn their attention to a branch of trade , the
     returns from which were very rapid . This brought
     a farther accession of capital into it, and led to
     the erection of mills containing a greater or less
     number of spinning machines , propelled by water
     power, with the assistance of human labour .
     These mills were built in places at some distance
     from the towns , though as near as circumstances
     would permit for the convenience of markets , and

    readiness of transport for the raw and manufac-
    tured material . 3 Their site in other respects was
    chosen with regard to two necessary things,
    one, the existence of a stream of sufficient [volume]
   and permanence, - and the other the neighbour-
   hood of suitable workmen[ .]
     These mills were exclusively devoted to the
    first processes of manufacture [,] namely[,] carding
   and spinning . Their gradual increase very soon
    influenced the prosperity of the domestic manu-
    facturer his profits quickly fell, workmen being
    readily found to superintend the mill labour [,][ at]
    a rate of wages high it is true ; but [yet][ compara-]
    tively much lower than the estimated value of
   home labour.
     Another cause which tended to injure the pri-
    vate spinner was the incessant and expensive [im-]
    provements in the construction of machines .
   Thus the man who one year laid out a consider-
    able sum in the purchase of a jenny of the best
   and most approved make , found himself[,] in the
    course of the year following, so much behind-
    hand , that with his utmost industry he could
    barely turn out a sufficient quantity of yarn [to]
    repay him for his present labour[,] in consequence
    of alterations which threw the [productive][ power]
    of his machine into the shade [.] The price of yarn
    became of necessity depreciated in proportion [to]
    to the quantity produced , which was now more
    than sufficient to supply the home demand [.] Find-
    ing his efforts thus futile to keep pace with im-

      proved machinery, he was compelled either to
      dispose of his jenny, and this at an immense sa-
       crifice, often indeed at a merely nominal price,
      or make an arrangement with the maker for an
      exchange at a rate almost equally ruinous . The
     number of machines which at this period were
     thrown back into the market, gave a strong im-
      pulse to the growth of the mills ; a machine
      that was not sufficiently perfect for the purpose
      of domestic manufacture , doing well enough
      in a mill in conjunction with others , worked
      at a less rate of wages, and assisted by water
     power, when its use was valueless to its original
     owner, who was consequently left in many cases
      in a worse condition , in a pecuniary point of view,
      than when he commenced his new vocation , no
      time having been given him to cover its first
      cost.
       This necessarily led to great difficulties and to
      embarrassments of no ordinary kind , and was the
       first step towards the abolition of the small free-
      holder or yeoman . Their long course of inac-
      tivity, and the little diffusion of intelligence
     amongst them, rendered them incapable of main-
      taining the struggle with men who had been ac-
     customed to the variations of trade ; and whose
      forethought enabled them to apply remedies , and
      take such precautionary and anticipative measures
      as screened them from loss . Their little estates
     became in the lapse of a few years so encumbered ,
      as to be utterly worthless to them, and a very

   rapid and very extensive change took place in
   landed proprietorship from 1790 to 1810 , the
   period when this transition was in progress .
     This declension, though nearly, was not quite
    universal. The apathy which had so long op-
   pressed and hidden the energies of their character,
   had failed in quite extinguishing them ; and a few
   of these men , shaking off their slothful habits , both
   of body and mind, devoted themselves to remedy-
   ing their condition with a perseverance certain to
   be successful . Joining to this determination a
    practical acquaintance with the details of manu-
    factures , personal superintendance, and indus-
    try, several of the most eminently successful
   steam-manufacturers have sprung from this class
    of people, and have long since become the most
    opulent of a wealthy community.
     There is a singularity attending the rise of
   some of these individuals , showing very strongly
   how infinitely superior is personal endeavour to
   accumulated wealth , when both are devoted to the
   same purposes . Few of the men who entered the
    trade rich were successful . They trusted too
   much to others too little to themselves ; whilst,
   on the contrary, the men who did establish them-
    selves were raised by their own efforts-com-
   mencing in a very humble way, and pushing their
   advance by a series of unceasing exertions , hav-
    ing a very limited capital to begin with, or even
   none at all save that of their own labour. *

      The time was now arrived when another great
      change took place in the relative situations of the
     two divisions of manufacturers. The improved
      machines ; their increased number ; the esta-
      blishment of mills ; the accession of capital - one
     and all produced a much greater quantity of yarn
      than could by any possibility be converted into
      cloth by the hand-loom weaver . A surplus of
      course remained, which was either sent to the
      foreign market, or remained as a dead weight
     upon the maker . The demand for cloth was how-
      ever still unsupplied , and it became necessary to
      introduce great numbers of new hands as weavers .
     So long as the supply of yarn had been limited ,
      or beneath, or just equal to the demand, the
      weavers had felt but little competition ; their
     wages had consequently remained steady. Now ,
     however, when the outcry for cloth continued ,
     and yarn was abundant, a large body of weavers
     immigrated into the manufacturing districts-
      almost the entire mass of agricultural labourers
      deserted their occupations, and a new race of
     hand-loom weavers , which had undergone none of
     the transitions of the primitive manufacturers,
     were the product of the existing state of things .
       This body of men was of a still lower
     grade in the social scale than the origi-
      nal weavers , had been earning a much less
     amount of wages , and had been accustomed [to]
     be mere labourers . The master spinners , there-
      fore, found them ready to work at an inferior

```
    price, and thus discovered an outlet for their
    extra quantity of yarn . This at once led to a
    great depreciation in the price of hand-loom la-
    bour, and was the beginning of that train of dis-
    asters which has finally terminated in reducing
    those who have clung to it to a state of
    starvation.
    Human power is urged beyond a certain point
    with great difficulty ; and , what is still worse ,
   when great numbers of individuals are in exclusive
    possession of one particular occupation, the na-
    tural caprice incident to mankind , with an occa-
    sional inaptitude for regular labour , and a dispo-
    sition to interfere vexatiously , at times, when its
    employer is pressed , either by a superabundance ,
    or by a too small demand for his goods , have
    always rendered it a power difficult to manage,
    and still more difficult to be depended upon.
    Nor are these the only unpleasantnesses con-
    nected with it : men are apt to acquire notions
    of exclusive possession , and to hold an opinion
    that improvements in machinery , which lessen
    the value of their labour, are wrongs inflicted
    upon them— are infringements upon their peculiar
    domain . These evils were keenly felt by the
    early manufacturers , who had to trust entirely to
    hand - labour . They were subjected periodically
    to severe immediate losses , and to the chance of
     still greater ulterior ones, by the refractory spirit
    of their hands, who timed their opportunity
    when the markets were particularly pressing,

      the other two put together.
      The class of poor weavers were thus instanta-
      neously elevated very considerably in worldly con-
      sideration . They were freed from one great cause
      of depression, which had hitherto prevented all
      chance of improvement. They now took their
      stand upon the same ground with the weaver,
     who had hitherto been a great farmer, and who
      had come down one degree in the social scale, in
      consequence of giving up his land for the purpose
      of devoting himself to the more profitable business
      of weaving. This amalgamation of the two di-

      general character as a body, rendered them more
      united , and by diffusing one species of labour uni-
       versally over the whole class , gave them a com-
      munity ofinterests and feelings which bound them
      together.
      A very material improvement, therefore , had
      been gradually operating in both classes of
      weavers, during the half century immediately
      preceding the application of steam power. This
      improvement had not arisen so much from any
       increase in the rate of payment for labour , as
      from a market generally understocked , and a con-
       stantly increasing production for yarn , which
       enabled them to work full hours , and of conse-
       quently to throw off a regular and sufficient quan-
       tity of cloth .

     and passing through a revolution which modified
     the whole body, and terminated finally in the ruin
     of the greater portion .
       In the early times of manufacturing , the spinner
     and the weaver were to some extent synonymous
     -so far indeed , that the processes were carried on
     under the same roof, and by the same individuals ;
     the distaff, the wheel, and the loon being all
      called into requisition by a single family.
      At a later period , when improvements in ma-
     chinery progressed rapidly, stimulated as they
     were by the inability constantly felt to supply the
     demand for yarn , and as these improved machines
      at each step became more bulky , more compli-
     cated, and consequently more expensive—a divi-
      sion began to shew itself between the weaver
     and spinner, --the latter throwing aside his wheel
     and devoting himself to the loom , trusting to ex-
      ternal sources for his yarn , from a growing inabi-
      bility to purchase such machinery as would
     enable him to spin profitably- and the former de-
      serting the loom, and applying his funds to pro-
     cure the best and most recent contivances for
     spinning, knowing as he did that a market was
     always open to his produce.
      At this period, that is at the time when spin-
     ning was become a separate branch, and when

   the division between the two bodies was well
    defined , the spinners were joined by another [class]
   of persons , who had heretofore held aloof[,] from
   manufacture-and this was the yeoman-the male
    freeholder now nearly extinct as a part of the
    social [confederacy].
    The yeoman had lived generation after gene-
    ration upon his patrimonial acres- rarely increa-
   sing their extent and quite as rarely lessening
   them . He had , however, failed to keep pace with
   the onward march of events-had confined him-
    self to cultivating his land precisely in the same
   way in which it had been cultivated by his [fore-]
    fathers -viewed all innovations as rank heresy [,]
    vegetated upon his natal soil , profiting either [it]
   or the world but little ; but having[ ,] notwithstand-
    ing many points about him of real value . He
   was strictly honest in all his dealings-though
    almost universally improvident , more , however,
    from want of mental energy and forethought,
    than from actual extravagance- contented with [his]
    lot , and a kind and hearty neighbour- but [utterly]
    unable to cope with the crisis which was opening
    upon him. He had hitherto been surrounded by
    petty farmers- who had generally eked out their
    bad management as cultivators by being weavers [,]
    and who had served him as bulwarks or break-
    waters against the impending storm[.] These were
    one by one removed , and their places imme-
    diately occupied by a race of men who gave [a]
    considerably increased rent, and who by im-

     proved modes of husbandry, and by wringing
     from the soil all it could possibly yield, soon
     drove the small proprietor from the markets
     which he had so long supplied . Thus pressed
     upon by superior industry, and an activity with
     which he could not compete , the yeoman was
     driven to embark some portion of his means
     iu the purchase of spinning machines, and before
     very long, great quantities of yarn were produced
     by the inmates of old farm-houses , in which pre-
     viously the most sluggish inertness had prevailed .
      Nothing can more clearly shew how very im-
     perfectly this class had used its resources, than the
     fact, that five- sevenths of those who purchased
     these machines were obliged to have recourse to
     a loan, generally a mortgage , to raise the money.
      The price of the mere complicated spinning
     machines was very considerable , and it has been
     seen removed them out of the reach of the infe-
     rior class of weavers . This, aided by other causes
     already noticed , brought the small freeholder into
     the field . At the same time monied men began
     to turn their attention to a branch of trade , the
     returns from which were very rapid . This brought
     a farther accession of capital into it, and led to
     the erection of mills containing a greater or less
     number of spinning machines , propelled by water
     power, with the assistance of human labour.
     These mills were built in places at some distance
     from the towns, though as near as circumstances
     would permit for the convenience of markets , and

    readiness of transport for the raw and manufac-
    tured material . Their site in other respects was
    chosen with regard to two necessary things , -
    one, the existence of a stream of sufficient volume
   and permanence, and the other the neighbour-
   hood of suitable workmen .
     These mills were exclusively devoted to the
    first processes of manufacture , namely, carding
    and spinning . Their gradual increase very soon
    influenced the prosperity of the domestic manu-
    facturer- his profits quickly fell , workmen being
    readily found to superintend the mill labour , at
    a rate of wages high it is true ; but yet compara-
    tively much lower than the estimated value of
   home labour.
     Another cause which tended to injure the pri-
    vate spinner was the incessant and expensive im-
    provements in the construction of machines .
    Thus the man who one year laid out a consider-
    able sum in the purchase of a jenny of the best
    and most approved make , found himself, in the
    course of the year following, so much behind-
    hand , that with his utmost industry he could
    barely turn out a sufficient quantity of [yarn][ to]
    repay him for his present labour, in consequence
    of alterations which threw the productive power
    of his machine into the shade . The price of yarn
    became of necessity depreciated in proportion to
    to the quantity produced, which was now more
    than sufficient to supply the home demand . Find-
    ing his efforts thus futile to keep pace with im-

```
     proved machinery, he was compelled either to
     dispose of his jenny, and this at an immense sa-
      crifice , often indeed at a merely nominal price ,
     or make an arrangement with the maker for an
     exchange at a rate almost equally ruinous . The
     number of machines which at this period were
     thrown back into the market, gave a strong im-
     pulse to the growth of the mills ; a machine
      that was not sufficiently perfect for the purpose
     of domestic manufacture, doing well enough
     in a mill in conjunction with others , worked
      at a less rate of wages, and assisted by water
     power, when its use was valueless to its original
     owner, who was consequently left in many cases
     in a worse condition , in a pecuniary point of view,
     than when he commenced his new vocation , no
     time having been given him to cover its first
     cost.
      This necessarily led to great difficulties and to
     embarrassments of no ordinary kind , and was the
      first step towards the abolition of the small free-
     holder or yeoman . Their long course of inac-
      tivity, and the little diffusion of intelligence
     amongst them, rendered them incapable of main-
     taining the struggle with men who had been ac-
     customed to the variations of trade ; and whose
     forethought enabled them to apply remedies , and
     take such precautionary and anticipative measures
     as screened them from loss . Their little estates
     became in the lapse of a few years so encumbered ,
     as to be utterly worthless to them, and a very

   rapid and very extensive change took place in
   landed proprietorship from 1790 to 1810, the
   period when this transition was in progress .
    This declension, though nearly, was not quite
   universal. The apathy which had so long op-
   pressed and hidden the energies of their character,
   had failed in quite extinguishing them ; and a few
   of these men, shaking off their slothful habits, both
   of body and mind , devoted themselves to remedy-
   ing their condition with a perseverance certain to
   be successful . Joining to this determination a
   practical acquaintance with the details of manu-
   factures , personal superintendance , and indus-
   try, several of the most eminently successful
   steam -manufacturers have sprung from this class
   of people, and have long since become the most
   opulent of a wealthy community.
    There is a singularity attending the rise of
   some of these individuals , showing very strongly
   how infinitely superior is personal endeavour to
   accumulated wealth , when both are devoted to the
   same purposes. Few of the men who entered the
   trade rich were successful. They trusted too
   much to others too little to themselves ; whilst ,
   on the contrary, the men who did establish them-
   selves were raised by their own efforts- com-
   mencing in a very humble way, and pushing their
   advance by a series of unceasing exertions , hav-
   ing a very limited capital to begin with, or even
   none at all save that of their own labour. *

```
      The time was now arrived when another great
     change took place in the relative situations of the
     two divisions of manufacturers . The improved
     machines ; their increased number ; the esta-
     blishment of mills ; the accession of capital- one
     and all produced a much greater quantity of yarn
     than could by any possibility be converted into
      cloth by the hand-loom weaver . A surplus of
     course remained, which was either sent to the
     foreign market, or remained as a dead weight
     upon the maker . The demand for cloth was how-
     ever still unsupplied , and it became necessary to
     introduce great numbers of new hands as weavers.
     So long as the supply of yarn had been limited ,
     or beneath, or just equal to the demand , the
     weavers had felt but little competition ; their
     wages had consequently remained steady. Now,
     however, when the outcry for cloth continued ,
     and yarn was abundant, a large body of weavers
     immigrated into the manufacturing districts-
     almost the entire mass of agricultural labourers
     deserted their occupations , and a new race of
     hand- loom weavers , which had undergone none of
     the transitions of the primitive manufacturers ,
     were the product of the existing state of things .
       This body of men was of a still lower
     grade in the social scale than the origi-
      nal weavers , had been earning a much less
     amount of wages, and had been accustomed to
     be mere labourers . The master spinners, there-
     fore, found them ready to work at an inferior

```

```
    price, and thus discovered an outlet for their
    extra quantity of yarn . This at once led to a
    great depreciation in the price of hand-loom la-
    bour, and was the beginning of that train of dis-
     asters which has finally terminated in reducing
    those who have clung to it to a state of
     starvation .
     Human power is urged beyond a certain point
    with great difficulty ; and , what is still worse ,
    when great numbers of individuals are in exclusive
     possession of one particular occupation, the na-
     tural caprice incident to mankind, with an occa-
     sional inaptitude for regular labour, and a dispo-
     sition to interfere vexatiously , at times , when its
     employer is pressed , either by a superabundance ,
     or by a too small demand for his goods , have
     always rendered it a power difficult to manage,
    and still more difficult to be depended upon.
    Nor are these the only unpleasantnesses con-
     nected with it : men are apt to acquire notions.
     of exclusive possession , and to hold an opinion
     that improvements in machinery, which lessen
     the value of their labour, are wrongs inflicted
    upon them— are infringements upon their peculiar
     domain . These evils were keenly felt by the
     early manufacturers , who had to trust entirely to
     hand - labour . They were subjected periodically
     to severe immediate losses , and to the chance of
      still greater ulterior ones, by the refractory spirit
     of their hands, who timed their opportunity
    when the markets were particularly pressing,

```
      to urge their claims . They had indeed but
       little alternative ,—and it is quite certain that a
      crisis was rapidly approaching which would have
     checked, if not annihilated , the progress of ma-
      nufactures, when steam, and its application to
     machinery,* at once turned the current against
      the men, and has been since steadily but securely
     sweeping their opposition to the dust, all their
      efforts to free themselves from its subjection
     having been totally unavailing, and worse than
      useless .
      * The first steam looms were introduced in 1806, and fol-
      lowed by serious riots and breaking and destroying of ma-
      chinery.

      but a part of the great whole , exhibiting , as in a
      microcosm , the virtues and vices which are its dis-
      tinguishing characteristics .
      One of the most striking revolutions ever pro-
      duced in the moral and social condition of a moiety
      ofa great nation , is that which has been consequent
      to the application of steam to machinery . It is one
      which will be found to possess many points of
      great interest to every man who considers the
      happiness , or looks forward to the probable destiny
      of that large portion of the productive population ,
      connected with manufactures .
       The rapidity with which this revolution has
      been effected , is not the least remarkable circum-
      stance about it ; and strikingly illustrates the truth
      of the foregoing proposition- that wherever men
      are congregated in large bodies , their morals must
      be deteriorated . One great effect of the steam-
      engine has been , to crowd workmen together ; to
       collect them from parts in which they had hitherto
      formed portions of a scattered population . But
      the cause, powerful as it is, has been aided by
     many others of scarcely less efficacy ; and it is
      these which require elucidation , as they throw a
      strong light upon the present depraved and de-
      based condition of the class of manufacturing
      labourers .
      Many of the first successful manufacturers were
     men who had their origin in the rank of mere ope-
       ratives , or who sprung from the extinct class of
     yeomen . It has been already explained that this

```

-----

```
    class had been driven, by the pressure of circum-
    stances, * to the adoption of spinning, at the period
   when trade was undergoing that series of changes
   which ended in the introduction of steam .
    The celerity with which some of these indivi-
    duals accumulated wealth in the early times of
   steam spinning and weaving, are proofs-if any
   such were wanting - that they were men of quick
   views, great energy of character, and possessing
   no small share of sagacity ; and were by these
   means able to avail themselves to the utmost of
    the golden advantages , which were presented
    to their grasp , from 1790 to 1817 , a time when
   they supplied the whole universe with the products
    of manufacture.
    But they were men of very limited general in-
   formation- men who saw and knew little of any
    thing beyond the demand for their twist or cloth ,
   and with the speediest and best modes for their
   production. They were , however, from their ac-
   quired station , men who exercised very conside-
    rable influence upon the hordes of workmen who
   became dependent upon them .
    The acquisition of wealth , unfortunately for the
    interests of all parties , was not attended by a cor-
   respondent improvement in their moral and social
    character ; on the contrary , all who had an oppor-
    tunity of watching its effects, can only deplore
   and condemn the evil purposes to which, for many
    years, some portions of it were applied .

      The extreme rapidity with which the returns
      were made for a considerable period-and this too
      with an immense profit- and the rich and appa-
      rently unbounded prospect that was stretched
      out before them, fairly turned their heads. In
      this respect, indeed , they resembled the man in the
      Arabian Nights' tale , whose eye had been touched
      with the magic ointment, and which in conse-
      quence presented to his mental vision an endless
      display of wealth . The uproarious enjoyments ,
      the sensual indulgences , which were witnessed
      at the orgies of these men , totally unchecked by
     any intercourse with more polished society , should
      have had the veil of oblivion drawn over them ,
     were it not that, to some degree , they tend to ex-
      plain the depravity which in a few years , like a
     moral plague , spread over the manufacturing po-
      pulation , wherever they were brought together in
     numerous bodies .
      The sprinkling of men of more refined habits
     amongst the early successful cotton manufacturers,
     was extremely scanty. Very few who brought
      large capital into the trade, were fortunate- or
     even made satisfactory progress. Neither will this
      fact be considered singular, when it is remem-
     bered with whom the battle had to be fought.
     They had to oppose men who had a practical ac-
     quaintance with machinery , and who laboured
     themselves , assiduously and diligently ; whereas
     the previous pursuits and education of the capi-
      talist , had unfitted him, in some respects, for that

    rapidity of action and quickness of calculation ,
    which were essentially necessary, if he must
    keep pace with the daily improvements pro-
    jected and carried on around him .
     Master cotton- spinners and weavers then [,] at
    the commencement of this important [epoch] [,][ were]
    in many instances men sprung from the ranks [of]
    the labourers , or from a grade just removed above
    these uneducated - of coarse habits-sensual[ in]
    their enjoyments-partaking of the rude [revelry]
    of their dependants- overwhelmed by [success-]
    but yet, paradoxical as it may sound[ ,][ industrious]
    men, and active and far-sighted tradesmen[ .]
     Many of these might be found , after a night
    spent in debauchery and licentiousness, sobered
    down by an hour or two of rest, and by the
    ringing of the factory bell, going through the
    business of the day with untiring activity and
    unerring rectitude-surrounded too , as they were,
    by their companions , alike busily engaged under
    their inspection- again to plunge, at the expira-

    of inebriation and riot.
     Meanwhile a great change was progressing in
    the homes of these men. Wealth brought with it
    some of its usual accessories . The low and irre-
    gularly built farm -house , or the cottage attached
    to the mill , were exchanged for mansions erected
    purposely for them- larger, more commodious , and
    in the most modern order of domestic architecture ,
    furnished in a style of shew and expense-if not

     of taste- sufficiently indicative of the state of the
     owner's purse and prospects ; and to these were
     transferred the manners which had unhappily
     disgraced their late more humble residences .
     They did not, it is true , introduce here their
    low and dissolute companions, in whose society a
     portion of their time was still spent . The re-
     unions, however, which did occur , though of a
     different order, consisting generally of men of
     their own, or somewhat inferior standing, were
     fully as debased , and drink-drink was their only
     amusement and occupation .
      Utterly destitute of every thing intellectual ,
     and utterly condemning every thing savouring of
     refinement, whether in manner or thought , they
     were in some measure driven to the indulgence of
     their animal sensations . This was generally
     sought for in the use of ardent spirits, which
     roused and maddened them for a time into fu-
     rious joy, and rendered them unconscious of all
     that was due to decency or propriety . Thus"
     wallowing in intemperance , little wonder can be
     excited that other passions were stimulated into
     active operation ; and from their situation , un-
     bounded facilities were offered for their display .
      Animal sensations must ever be the predomi-
     nant occupiers of coarse , uneducated minds . The
     great advantage of education , when conducted
     in a way calculated to attain its legitimate
     end , is— that it makes man less a prey to sense ,
    by giving him other and nobler contemplations ,

   and fixing his regards upon mental exertions and
   enjoyments , which are diametrically opposed to
   the grosser demands of his nature . This is the
   advantage that education possesses when legiti-
   mately conducted ; but these purposes are not
   gained by common education, which is too funda-
   mental, and too exclusively intellectual, and
   which aims apparently at merely expanding the
   ideas, without troubling itself as to their proper
    direction . Hence they are left to wander back
    to their original tendency , aided in their intensity
   by the very imperfect development given to
    morals .
    The almost entire extinction of sexual decency ,
   which is one of the darkest stains upon the cha-
    racter of the manufacturing population-the laxity
   in all the moral obligations which ought to exist
   between the sexes, and the consequent loss of
    this most important influence in the formation of
    social manners , may be traced , to some extent, to
    this period of their history.
    The little restraint which existed as to inter-
    course between the sexes , * before this juncture ,
   may with some degree of justice be pointed out
    as having laid the ground - work or paved the way
    for the existing dereliction . This is doubtless
    correct, in so far that it had broken up the deli-
    cacy of feeling, and chastity of deportment , which
    should distinguish the bearing of the young of

     with the grossness which now sprung up on all
      sides, dating its origin , it is again repeated , in
      the want of moral discipline on the part of many
      of the early manufacturers .

      of these parties , it may be remarked , that the
      mischief lay in no small degree upon the par-
      ticular juncture in which they were brought so

     scenes were enacted that even put to the blush
     the lascivious Saturnalia of the Romans , the rites
     ofthe Pagoda girls of India, and the Harem life of
     the most voluptuous Ottoman .

    Numbers of these infatuated youths reaped
   their reward early, and were cut off on the very
   threshold of manhood , by a career of unbridled
   indulgence ; others had a more prolonged ex-
   istence , a " sort of life in death , " and sunk
   gradually into the grave, borne down by slow and
   lingering consumption ; or their physical energies
   were so reduced , their healthy stamina so de-
   stroyed, that they had no power to resist disease,
   however slight, and were consequently carried
   away in rapid succession-
       " Et minimæ vires frangere quassa valent[.]"
   Marriage was repudiated amongst them, and was
   indeed utterly at variance with the license reign-
   ing over all their sexual appetites .
     Nothing can more clearly shew the demoralizing
    effects of this pernicious intercourse than the fact,
    that a girl, who was known to have lived in a state
   of concubinage , found no difficulty in marrying
   subsequently amongst her equals. So debased
   became their tone of thinking, and so utterly
   were they lost to all sense of decency and
   shame, that not only was no difficulty found by
   these girls in procuring husbands , but this was
   even managed during the very time their intimacy
   was going on with their seducer , and which , not
   unfrequently , was continued up to the very day of
    their marriage, and even subsequently.

     mitted or sanctioned such abominable proceed-
      ings , did not shut his eyes to all comers , going
     even one step beyond the Roman Gippius , whose
     remark became proverbial in his own day-" non
     omnibus dormio ."
       This laxity , or rather this entire absence of all
     regard for moral obligations relating to sex, ex-
     tending, as it did, beyond the threshold of mar-
      riage, sapped the foundations and overthrew the
      structure of the social virtues . Father , mother,
     son and daughter, were mere words, leading to
     none ofthose delightful associations which are the
      fount from whence spring, in a tide of sparkling
      purity, the best and most hallowed of man's plea-
      sures and emotions. The links of domestic affec-
      tion-the passions which properly belong to it, are
                    " As gentle
          As zephyrs blowing beneath the violet,
                                    ""
           Not stirring its sweet head ;
     and the loss of these has shorn the homes of the
     manufacturing population of almost every thing
     which can give home a value .
       It must be understood that in pointing out a
      state ofthings, and a mode of life, happily greatly
     amended, the first manufacturers of this epoch
     must bear the blame for presenting an example ,
      to which the peculiar circumstances of the times
     gave great and immediate force . Had a high sense
     ofmoral obligations taught them to introduce strict
      discipline into their mills , by separating the sexes
      as far as possible, and by keeping a watchful eye

   upon their own passions, a very different aspect
   would now be undoubtedly presented by this
   population . The impulse being given, the
   barrier of private decency being broken down ,
   man's natural propensities , aided in their ope-
   ration by collateral causes , will long prevent a
   filling up of the breach ; and till this is done ,
    till the social virtues, till the morals of home are
   established among them , no nostrums of political
   economy, no bare intellectual education , no ex-
   tension of political rights, ever can or ever will
   make them a happy , respectable , or contented
   race of men.

     INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND MANNERS UPON

       -Vicious Example-Peculiarity of sexual Passions- Importance of
        propriety of Manners-Want of Attention on the Part of the Mill-

       Importance of proper sexual Restraint-Value of Refinement of

      THE crowding together numbers of the young
     of both sexes in factories, is a prolific source of
      moral delinquency The stimulus of a heated at-
     mosphere, the contact of opposite sexes , the ex-
     ample of lasciviousness upon the animal passions-
      all have conspired to produce a very early deve-
     lopment of sexual appetencies . Indeed , in this
      respect, the female population engaged in manu-

    factures , approximates very closely to that found
    in tropical climates ; puberty, or at least sexual
    propensities, being attained almost coeval with
    girlhood .
     The influence of these maturing causes is more
    strikingly seen in the female than in the male, in
    consequence of its effects being of a more promi-
    nent and observable character.
     It may be questioned whether puberty, in the
   common acceptation of the term , is necessary for
    the display and exercise of functions of sex . * Ob-
     *" The age ofpuberty amongst the Tahitians is about ten or
    eleven. The women have such early connexion with the other
    sex, that the catamenia never (that I heard of) appear before
    such connexion.
     " Some marry as young as ten ; but the average age is about
    fourteen or fifteen. Marriage takes place from twelve to six-
     teen years ; but formerly sexual intercourse began much earlier,
    and was often practised when the parties could not be more
    than six or seven. I am quite confident I am stating fact on
     this point."-Answers ofMr. Ellis and Mr. Bourne. Roberton,
    North ofEngland Medical and Surgical Journal, No. I. , p . 180 .
     " In Asiatic manners there is much to be found that is odious
    and feculent ; and ofthis the most pre-eminently disgusting part
     is the precocious acquaintance with the sexual passion which
    almost universally obtains . In allusion to the way in which
    the Hindoos train their children, the Abbé Dubois informs us
     that, from their earliest infancy , they are accustomed to scenes
    of impropriety-that it is not uncommon to see children of five
     or six years of age become familiar with discourse and action
    which would make modesty turn aside. The nudity in which
    they live for the first seven or eight years- the loose conversa-
     tion, tales and songs to which they have to listen the stories
    of the dissolute lives of their gods-the solemn festivals so
     often celebrated, where modesty is totally excluded—the abo-
     minable allusions which many of their daily practices recal-

      servation has taught , that the usual marks ac-
     companying and preceding this epoch in the
     female , have very frequently been wanting in in-
     stances where unequivocal proofs were given that
     the individuals had not only suffered , but also en-
     joyed intercourse. Not only this , but in some
     examples pregnancy has occurred , where the usual
     physiological data, generally esteemed requisite for
      its production, have been entirely wanting.
       Independently of this however , the usual accom-
     paniments of puberty shew themselves very early,
     stimulated into premature activity by the above
     causes , and unchecked in their effects upon man-
     ners by the absence of moral discipline , whether
      at home or abroad .
      So far indeed is this from [being] the [case][,][ that]
      at the mill the factory girl is subjected [to][ a][ series]
     of excitements , which inevitably lead[ to][ the][ ulti-]
     matum of desire . She can hardly be said to have
     a home-certainly she has [none] in the proper
     sense of the word-for the whole [of][ the][ day][ is]
     passed from it, and she visits it merely for the
     purpose of rest. It has no moral ties upon her ;
     and her parents are perhaps positively [injurious]
      to her in this [respect] . *
      their private and public monuments, on which nothing is ever
      represented but the most revolting obscenities—and their wor-
      ship, in which prostitutes act the principal part :-these are
      some of the polluted sources from which the youthful imagina-
      tion of the Hindoo draws its imagery."-Ibidem, p . 186 .

     The advantages resulting from the simple ob-
     servances of common propriety, may be judged of
    by the evils which attend upon their absence .
    Gross language , unrestricted allowance of word
    and deed pertaining to sexual gratification , are
    pregnant proofs of what the reality is , when
    the outward form is so debased . The peculiar
     qualities of these passions-one of the most
     striking of these being the readiness with which
    they are roused by a word, a look , or a gesture ,
    and the undying hold they take on the ima-
     gination , when once permitted to revel at large—
    render the want of some sufficient visible check
    very obvious.
      Unfortunately no regard , however slight , is
    paid to these matters by the majority of mill-
    owners . A certain number of hands are required
     to superintend the labours of their untiring engine ,
    with its complement of looms , & c . & c . , for a cer-
     situation to which we allude, for being virtuous and chaste ?
    Where they are unshackled from religious principle, as is too
     generally the case, they have no delicate sentiments ofmorality
     and taste to restrain them from gratifying every passion : they
     have few or no pleasures beyond those which arise from sensual
     indulgence- it involves no loss of character, for their com-
     panions are as reckless as themselves—it brings no risk of losing
     their employment, for their employers know that it would be
     unsafe to inquire into these matters : it is often a cause of no
     pecuniary loss, for in many cases the poor laws provide against
     this ; and all these circumstances considered , the licentiousness
     of the manufacturing population is a source of bitter lamenta-
     tion to us, but of no astonishment whatever."-Inquiry, &c.
     into the Condition of the Manufacturers, &c. p . 26.

      If the influence of temperature has been ex-
     aggerated upon these points , there is one question
     which has been neglected , in taking into account
     the causes which govern sexual maturity ; and
     that is , the customs , habits, and modes of life
     which prevail in the countries in which observa-
     tions have been made . These are, unquestionably,
     far more important agents than mere temperature ,
     both in calling into being sexual desire , and ac-
     celerating, in consequence , the period of puberty.
     It is quite needless to enter into any argument to
     prove that whatever excites the generative
     organs, will have a tendency to develope their
     specific functions ; viz . menstruation and concep-
     tion . The same remark is applicable not only to
     these organs , but to any and to every organ
     composing the human body. An attentive ex-
     amination of the writings of various travellers and
      tracted virginity. That this is not the case is abundantly
     proved by northern voyagers and travellers- witness Hearne[,]
      Franklin, Parry, Lyon, Crantz, Richardson[,] &c[.] & c[.] Parry
      declares that in no country is prostitution carried to a [greater]
      extent than among the Esquimaux- that no people[ are][ more]
      libidinous and dissolute. Mention is more than once made of
      girls of ten years of age being taken as wives . Mr. Richardson
     remarks, " that the women marry very young." Examples are
     given of wives of fourteen, sixteen, and eighteen years of age .
     -Vide Parry's first and second voyages ; Franklin's first and
      second journey; Hearne, &c. &c.-Humboldt, in speaking of
     the tribes of northern Asia, says, " that girls of ten years are
     found mothers." The evidence of Clarke and other writers
     who have visited the northern countries all agree in the same
      facts.

    observers ,* would demonstrate the accuracy of this

    sexual indulgence precedes and leads to what[ is]

    This is dependent , not so much upon any con-
    stitutional peculiarity, as upon manners which
    encourage and keep up libidinous feelings-and
    examples brought to bear upon passions so ex-
    citable and active as those having reference [to]
    sexual enjoyments are .
     It has long been noticed, that in warm coun-
    tries , and in nations still barbarous , or only in a
    state of partial civilization, very early marriages
    take place , and that women become mothers at
    a time which appears singularly premature to
    northern ideas ; at a time , indeed , when girls are
    looked upon as mere children , alike unknowing of
    and incapable ofbeing roused to sexual appetence .
    The moral and religious institutions which have
    prevailed in Great Britain , have discountenanced
    the intercourse of the sexes, till, comparatively
    speaking, a late period of life . Jurists and le-
    gislators have also lent the weight of their au-
    thority to the protraction of adult age till such

    time as it was supposed both body and mind
    would be equally matured .* These arrangements
     are, however, merely conventional ; but they have
     nevertheless produced very decided effects upon
    the physical nature of the population , by acting
    as so many powerful checks upon the display and
     early development of puberty. The germs of
     its maturity were nevertheless in being ; and ,
    were these checks removed , it is unquestionable
     that a great and striking change would take place
     in the social arrangements at present existing. †
     One of the most important advantages which
    has attended the past and present delay in ac-
    knowledging and countenancing the occurrence
    of puberty till so late a period , has been, that
    time and opportunity are given for the growth of
    those feelings of reserve and delicacy which both
    sexes have been necessarily driven to adopt for
      * The English law makes it felony to have intercourse with
     a child under ten years of age ; and a misdemeanor if above that
     age and under twelve .
      + The experience of medical men engaged in manufacturing
     towns affords evidence of this, for in these situations the [re-]
     straints of law and decency are unacknowledged[ .] A case is
     related in Mr. Roberton's paper in the North of England [Medi-]
     cal and Surgical Journal, as having occurred to a [respectable]
     surgeon, where a girl working in a cotton factory had become
     pregnant during her eleventh year, and that in all respects she
     was a full grown woman, and that the menses had [appeared]
     prior to this. Two similar cases have occurred to the author[,]
     and very many others to his professional friends[.] It is far from
    uncommon to find mothers at fifteen years of age, a period
     perhaps full as early as that in tropical countries [.]

    are subversive to so many of the[ social][ virtues] [—]

   By thus ridding the communion of all [grossness][ ,]
    the best guarantee is given for [its] moral [propriety] [.]

   condemned to the persecution of a host [of][ troubles]
    and vexations , which in the one sex ends by[ its]
    expulsion from its natural rank in the social
    confederacy .
     In speaking thus strenuously on the obser-

     relates to the morals and well -being of those sub-
     jected to their influence .
      The change in the moral and physical attri-
     butes of this population have been operated by
     temperature partly, but more especially by the
     force of example and manners already existing.
     Both are no doubt powerful agents , but there can
     be no difficulty in saying which must bear the
      principal onus of imputation. Co -operation has
     manifestly aided the effect of each separate in-
     Aluence, and has been the reason of its unex-
     ampled and rapid spread, and its permanence
     must of course depend upon the continuance or
      abstraction of the same causes.
      Temperature has done something to those who
     had been exposed to it from infancy, for from
      this period the factory labourer dates his labour.
     The manners of those around him have done
     much more in determining the precocious deve-
     lopment of sexual desire and of puberty. The
     mere fact of having been exposed from the
      earliest dawn of perception to sights and sounds
      stimulant upon passion , will easily account for
      this . Upon those who are introduced to the
      mill at or posterior to the usual age of puberty,
     temperature cannot do much ; but example, by
     producing a rush of new sensations, will be all
     powerful . In the one case then temperature aided
     by manners has been the cause of the change
     which has been produced ; in the other, manners

   and example have been the agents for perpetuating
   and extending it , and reducing all that come
   within their influence to the same condition .
   Most unfortunately as yet , no moral or religious
   check or impediment is in force to prevent [the]
    displays , necessarily resulting from this change[ ,]
    -nor are there any modifying and correcting
   agencies to lessen its mischievous tendencies[.]
    Had it been the wish of the early manufactu-
    rers to have made their workmen an orderly , mo-
    ral , and domestic race , their own example would ,
    in the first place , have been of the utmost import-
   ance . Failing in this, the next most important
   point would have been to have entrusted the over-
   looking department to individuals of good charac-
    ter and untainted morals , and of humane and
   considerate dispositions . Then the separating , as
    far as possible, the sexes, during the hours of la-
   bour, and carefully suppressing any display of
   grossness and immorality, so long as they were
   confined to the mills . Great improvements have
   and are taking place in these respects . Next, dis-
   missing or disgracing any party guilty of impro-
   per pratices ; and finally , rejecting steadily, and
    as an inviolable rule, all and every applicant for
   work who did not bring some testimony that he
   was a sober and moral person .
     These measures would have done much to-
   wards counteracting whatever forcing effects the
    temperature of their mills might have. 44 They

     would, at all events, have prevented them from
     becoming obnoxious . They would , by taking away
      other and more influential causes , urging on early
      sexual and physical development, have partially
     removed the evils ever attendant upon the crowd-
     ing together great bodies of people. Powerful
      restrictions would have also been placed upon
      that relaxation of sexual decency - that abolition
      of delicate and refined sentiments , and social ob-
      ligations, which ever lead to barbarous modes of
      living, and to the ruin of many of the fairest por-
      tions of man's character.
      They have, however, been neglected or over-
      looked , and a power which the masters might
     have exercised easily in the first instance , it
     would now be difficult if not impossible to assume .
     The numerous causes of dissension and suspicion
     which have arisen between them and the labour-
      ers , are so many impediments in the way of be-
      neficial and salutary inspection ; till these are re-
     moved, little expectation can be had of any strik-
      ing amelioration , proceeding from their interfer-
      ence . There are, however, certain changes in
      progress , that will, ere long, most probably
      enable them to do this easily and efficiently
      if, in the mean time , the volcanic elements com-
      posing the manufacturing population , do not burst
      out into active operation , and destroy the whole
      system of which they form the foundation .

    extent painful to contemplate . The exhibitions
    of the utter absence of sexual delicacy, common
    *" On the subject of the general licentiousness and illicit in-
     tercourse between the sexes, which prevails in manufacturing
     districts, we cannot, for obvious reasons, dwell so long, nor as
    minutely, as the extreme importance of the subject would justify.
    In the few words we shall devote to this branch of our inves-
     tigation, we shall be careful to keep within the limits of the
    most scrupulous accuracy, and to affirm nothing which we
    do not possess the materials for proving. First, then, we shall
    remark, that nothing but personal observation , or the testimony
    of eye-witnesses, can be relied on for satisfactory information.
    The returns of illegitimate children are worse than useless-
    for it will be obvious, on a few moments ' consideration, that in
    such cases they can afford us no possible criterion of the desired
     result. On this subject, some writers on political economy†
    betray the same ignorance as in the assertion of the extensive
    use of animal food among the manufacturing labourers . Both
     instances furnish an illustration of what appears to be a common
     source of error with them-- namely, a disposition to draw infe-
     rences from isolated facts, instead of resting their doctrines upon
    the basis of extension and accurate observation. They conclude, +
     that because the proportion of illegitimate births appears to be
     greater among agricultural than among the manufacturing
     population, the females of the former are the more immoral
     ofthe two. We draw, without doubt or hesitation , exactly the
     opposite conclusion , and every one intimately acquainted with
     the south of Lancashire will bear us out in this opinion . The
     deduction we draw is also materially confirmed by the practice
    which, it is painful to state, is far from uncommon among the
    abandoned women of these districts, of destroying , prematurely,
    the fruit and evidence of their guilt."-Enquiry, &c. p. 25.

      superficial observer. The robe of Arthur's mis-
      tress would be tried in vain on the great majority
     of the females .
       It is not denied that there are many girls who,
     from a coincidence of favourable causes , or from
      their possessing a higher and more just sense of
     what is due to themselves , escape some of the
     many evils which beset them, and grow up decent
     and moral women , fitted to make good wives and
     good mothers. These are, nevertheless, excep-
      tions ; not so rare as to be extremely remarkable ,
     but still standing out in strong relief from the
     mass to which they are attached .
      The causes which are so injurious to the fe-
     male, are operating, in a similar degree , and with
      similar force , upon the male , and produce pre-
      cisely similar effects , both upon his moral and

     It has been truly remarked by Bacon , that " the
    culture and manurance of mind in youth , hath
    such a forcible though unseen operation , as
    hardly any length of time or contention of labour,
    can countervail its influence. "
     The domestic manufacturer possessed one great
    advantage over the factory labourer[,] which was
    -that his occupation was carried on beneath [the]

     roof of his own cottage , and in the midst of
      his family also , that his children , growing up
     under his own eye , and around his fire - side , re-
     tained for him the respect and awe due to parental
     authority, by remaining members of one home
     and under the direction of one head .* By keep-
     ing up this natural and proper order of things, he
     secured one means of making his offspring do-
     mestic in their habits , and it was his own fault
      if their social character was not what it ought
     to be.
      So long as families were thus bound together
     by the strong link of interest and affection , each
     member in its turn , as it attained an age fitted for
     the loom , joined its labour to the general stock , its
      earnings forming part of a fund, the whole of
     which was placed at the disposal of the father or
     mother, as the case might be ; and each individual
     looked to him or to her for the adequate supply of
      its wants . No separate or distinct interests was
     ever acknowledged or dreamt of. If any one , by
      superior industry or skill , earned more in propor-
      tion than another, no separate claim was made
      for such excess on the part of that individual ; on
     the contrary, it was looked upon equally as a part
      of the wages ofthe family,-perhaps gratefully and
      affectionately acknowledged , but leading to no
      other result.
       This family compact, of course , existed no lon-

    ger than the usual period when [parental][ control]
    yields before the maturity of offspring. This was
    rarely before twenty-two or twenty-three [years] of
    age , and often much later. Grown up, as each
    member had , as part and parcel of a little com-
    munity, these divisions seldom took place before
    marriage opened a series of new cares and new
    prospects to son or daughter[,] which [,] in conse-
    quence seceded , or, as was frequently the case[,]
    brought a wife or husband to be joined [to][ the]
    family union . Generally, however, at this period
    an offset or branching took place[ ,] which was [best]
    for all parties.
     This preserved in all their vigour the moral
    obligations of father and mother, brother and
     sister, son and daughter, and that till a time of
     life was gained , which had given abundant oppor-
    tunity for the formation of character— a character
    most assuredly the best calculated to render the
    labouring man happy and virtuous , viz . , a do-
    mestic one ; without which, no adventitious aid
    can ever secure him their possession .
     The greatest misfortune-the most unfavour-
    able change which has resulted from factory la-
    bour, is the breaking up of these family ties ; the
    consequent abolition of the domestic circle , and
    the perversion of all the social obligations which
    should exist between parent and child on the
    one hand , and between children themselves on
    the other.
     The age at which a child became useful to its

     parents, so long as the great mass of manufactur-
     ing was manual and confined to private dwelling-
     houses, was from fourteen to sixteen. At an earlier
     age it was useful in a minor degree as winder ,
     &c.; but that was the period at which it became
     an auxiliary to the incomings of the family by
     working at the loom.
       Before this it was a mere child , entirely de-
     pendent upon the exertions of its parents [or][ older]
     brothers and sisters for support . During this
     time it was taught , by daily experieuce [,] habits of
     subordination to its seniors . The period at which
      it ranked itself by the side of the [efficient][ portions]
     of the household , was a happy medium between
     too early an application and too late a [procras-]
      tination of its physical energies [;] for the child
     was sufficiently matured , in its material [organiza-]
      tion, to bear without injury moderate and con-
     tinued exertion ; and no time had , as yet, been
     allowed for the acquirement of slothful [habits] it
     came, too, at a time when the first impulses of
     puberty were beginning to stir new associations
      in his mind . These it checked by keeping him
     occupied , while he was removed from the in-
     fluence of bad example, and laboured in an [open-]
     workshop, free from the stimulus of warmth[,] and
     in the presence of his sisters , brothers , and pa-
      rents , the very best anodyne for allaying and
     keeping in due restraint his nascent passions , -
     whilst his moral and social instincts were under a
     process of incessant cultivation [.]

   imagined that too much stress is laid upon them,
   and that the natural instincts of mankind , its
   moral tendencies , with the still higher principle ,

     the " mens divinior " are too little consulted- in
      fact, that the composition of the essence is over-
     looked in its fragrance and beauty.
      The form here , however, constitutes whatever
     there is of reality. Man cannot be taught to forget
      that he is a man, or that the breathing and blush-
     ing being before him is a woman ; that she is
     endowed like himself with an ardent tempera-
     ment-a desire for gratification ; that she has
     within and around her a world of delights which
     he is framed for and destined to enjoy ; and that
     she has passions which, if roused into activity,
     would overwhelm all sense of shame or pro-
      priety . Neither can he forget that he has a fire
     glowing within his own breast, that, if freed
     from the asbestos coating of moral decency,
     would overthrow all obstacles standing between
     him and the object of his desire , -nor that he has
     the capability of stirring into vigorous life , his
     own and woman's propensities . These he cannot
     be taught to forget the voice of nature is poten-
      tial . But he may be taught that his own welfare ,
     and more especially that of the creature before
     him , are intimately connected with the suppres-
     sion and concealment of their separate desires
     and capabilities. His sense of justice , as to what is
     due to himself, to her, and to the still wider circle
     in which he moves amongst his fellows , may be
      called into action, and thus become his own safe-
     guard, and the safe-guard of the woman, against
     the machinations of their respective passions ; and

    sphere, and have no occupation, save watching
    the passage of a thread or the revolution of a
    spindle. The mind is but little engaged , there is
   no variety for it to feed upon , -it has none of the
    pure excitements which home affords , -it be-
   comes crowded with images of the very opposite
    quality, and has its delicacy utterly and irre-
    trievably ruined , and no opportunity is given for
   the growth of modesty on the one hand , or of the
    social obligations of brother, sister, or child on
    the other .
    The next evil which removes factory labour an-
    other step still more widely apart from the con-
    dition of domestic manufacture is, that the wages
    of children have become, either by universal con-
    sent, or by the growth of disobedience , payable to
    the person earning them . This has led to another
    crying and grievous misfortune ; namely, that each
    child ceases to view itself as a subordinate agent
    in the household ; so far indeed loses the cha-
    racter and bearing of a child , that it pays over to
    its natural protector a stated sum for food and
    lodging ; thus detaching itself from parental sub-
    jection and control . The members , therefore , of
   a spinner's or weaver's family become a body of
    distinct individuals, occupying occasionally, but
   by no means universally, the same home, each
    paying its quota to the joint expenses , and con-
    sidering themselves as lodgers merely, and appro-
    priating any surplus which may remain oftheir
    wages to their own private purposes, accountable

      relates to the morals and well -being of those sub-
     jected to their influence .
      The change in the moral and physical attri-
     butes of this population have been operated by
     temperature partly, but more especially by the
      force of example and manners already existing .
     Both are no doubt powerful agents , but there can
     be no difficulty in saying which must bear the
      principal onus of imputation . Co-operation has
      manifestly aided the effect of each separate in-
     Auence , and has been the reason of its unex-
     ampled and rapid spread, and its permanence
     must of course depend upon the continuance or
      abstraction of the same causes .
       Temperature has done something to those who
     had been exposed to it from infancy, for from
      this period the factory labourer dates his labour.
     The manners of those around him have done
     much more in determining the precocious deve-
     lopment of sexual desire and of puberty . The
     mere fact of having been exposed from the
      earliest dawn of perception to sights and sounds
      stimulant upon passion , will easily account for
      this . Upon those who are introduced to the
      mill at or posterior to the usual age of puberty,
     temperature cannot do much ; but example, by
     producing a rush of new sensations , will be all
      powerful . In the one case then temperature aided
     by manners has been the cause of the change
     which has been produced ; in the other, manners

    and example have been the agents for perpetuating
    and extending it, and reducing all that come
    within their influence to the same condition .
    Most unfortunately as yet , no moral or religious
    check or impediment is in force to prevent the
    displays, necessarily resulting from this change ,
    -nor are there any modifying and correcting
    agencies to lessen its mischievous tendencies.
     Had it been the wish of the early manufactu-
     rers to have made their workmen an orderly , mo-
     ral , and domestic race , their own example would ,
     in the first place , have been of the utmost import-
    ance. Failing in this, the next most important
    'point would have been to have entrusted the over-
    looking department to individuals of good charac-
    ter and untainted morals , and of humane and
    considerate dispositions . Then the separating, as
     far as possible, the sexes , during the hours of la-
    bour, and carefully suppressing any display of
    grossness and immorality, so long as they were
    confined to the mills . Great improvements have
    and are taking place in these respects . Next , dis-
    missing or disgracing any party guilty of impro-
    per pratices ; and finally, rejecting steadily , and
    as an inviolable rule , all and every applicant for
    work who did not bring some testimony that he
    was a sober and moral person .
     These measures would have done much to-
    wards counteracting whatever forcing effects the
    temperature of their mills might have. They

    stances already detailed , are in full and undisguised

    shewing themselves at a very early age, and to an
    extent painful to contemplate . The exhibitions
    of the utter absence of sexual delicacy, common
     *" On the subject of the general licentiousness and illicit in-
    tercourse between the sexes, which prevails in manufacturing
     districts, we cannot, for obvious reasons, dwell so long, nor as
    minutely, as the extreme importance of the subject would justify.
    In the few words we shall devote to this branch of our inves-
    tigation, we shall be careful to keep within the limits of the
    most scrupulous accuracy, and to affirm nothing which we
    do not possess the materials for proving. First, then, we shall
    remark, that nothing but personal observation, or the testimony
    of eye-witnesses , can be relied on for satisfactory information.
    The returns of illegitimate children are worse than useless-
    for it will be obvious, on a few moments' consideration, that in
    such cases they can afford us no possible criterion of the desired
    result. On this subject, some writers on political economy+
    betray the same ignorance as in the assertion of the extensive
    use of animal food among the manufacturing labourers. Both
    instances furnish an illustration of what appears to be a common
    source of error with them-- namely, a disposition to draw infe-
    rences from isolated facts, instead of resting their doctrines upon
    the basis of extension and accurate observation . They conclude,
    that because the proportion of illegitimate births appears to be
    greater among agricultural than among the manufacturing
    population, the females of the former are the more immoral
    of the two. We draw, without doubt or hesitation, exactly the
    opposite conclusion, and every one intimately acquainted with
    the south of Lancashire will bear us out in this opinion . The
    deduction we draw is also materially confirmed by the practice
    which, it is painful to state, is far from uncommon among the
    abandoned women of these districts, of destroying, prematurely,
    the fruit and evidence of their guilt."-Enquiry, &c. p . 25.

     in manufacturing towns , are notorious to the most
     superficial observer. The robe of Arthur's mis-
     tress would be tried in vain on the great majority
     of the females .
       It is not denied that there are many girls who,
     from a coincidence of favourable causes , or from
     their possessing a higher and more just sense of
     what is due to themselves , escape some of the
     many evils which beset them, and grow up decent
     and moral women , fitted to make good wives and
     good mothers . These are, nevertheless, excep-
     tions ; not so rare as to be extremely remarkable ,
     but still standing out in strong relief from the
     mass to which they are attached .
      The causes which are so injurious to the fe-
     male , are operating, in a similar degree , and with
     similar force, upon the male, and produce pre-
     cisely similar effects , both upon his moral and

          CHAPTER III.
    THE INFLUENCE OF THE SEPARATION OF [FAMILIES] [,] &[c][.]
     UPON THE MORAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE
     MANUFACTURING POPULATION [.]

      and Advantages-No Child - labour- Effects of this upon [the] [Male]
      and Female Portion of his Household described- Factory Labour-
       Destruction of Home- Separation of Families-Effects of these

      It has been truly remarked by Bacon , that " the
     culture and manurance of mind in youth , hath
    such a forcible though unseen operation , as
     hardly any length of time or contention of labour,
    can countervail its influence ."
     The domestic manufacturer possessed one great
    advantage over the factory labourer, which was
    -that his occupation was carried on beneath the

```
     roof of his own cottage , and in the midst of
      his family also , that his children , growing up
     under his own eye , and around his fire - side , re-
     tained for him the respect and awe due to parental
     authority, by remaining members of one home
     and under the direction of one head .* By keep-
     ing up this natural and proper order of things , he
     secured one means of making his offspring do-
     mestic in their habits , and it was his own fault
      if their social character was not what it ought
      to be.
      So long as families were thus bound together
     by the strong link of interest and affection , each
     member in its turn , as it attained an age fitted for
     the loom , joined its labour to the general stock , its
     earnings forming part of a fund, the whole of
     which was placed at the disposal of the father or
     mother, as the case might be ; and each individual
     looked to him or to her for the adequate supply of
      its wants . No separate or distinct interests was
     ever acknowledged or dreamt of. If any one, by
      superior industry or skill , earned more in propor-
      tion than another, no separate claim was made
      for such excess on the part of that individual ; on
     the contrary, it was looked upon equally as a part
     of the wages ofthe family, -perhaps gratefully and
      affectionately acknowledged , but leading to no
      other result.
       This family compact, of course , existed no lon-

    ger than the usual period when parental control
    yields before the maturity of offspring. This was
    rarely before twenty-two or twenty-three years of
    age, and often much later. Grown up, as each
    member had , as part and parcel of a little com-
    munity, these divisions seldom took place before
    marriage opened a series of new cares and new
    prospects to son or daughter, which, in conse-
    quence seceded , or, as was frequently the case ,
    brought a wife or husband to be joined to the
    family union . Generally , however, at this period
    an offset or branching took place , which was best
    for all parties.
     This preserved in all their vigour the moral
    obligations of father and mother, brother and
     sister, son and daughter, and that till a time of
     life was gained , which had given abundant oppor-
    tunity for the formation of character-a character
    most assuredly the best calculated to render the
    labouring man happy and virtuous , viz ., a do-
    mestic one ; without which, no adventitious aid
    can ever secure him their possession .
     The greatest misfortune-the most unfavour-
    able change which has resulted from factory la-
    bour, is the breaking up of these family ties ; the
    consequent abolition of the domestic circle , and
    the perversion of all the social obligations which
    should exist between parent and child on the
    one hand, and between children themselves on
    the other .
     The age at which a child became useful to its

```

-----

```
      parents, so long as the great mass of manufactur-
      ing was manual and confined to private dwelling-
      houses, was from fourteen to sixteen . At an earlier
      age it was useful in a minor degree as winder ,
     &c.; but that was the period at which it became
      an auxiliary to the incomings of the family by
      working at the loom.
        Before this it was a mere child , entirely de-
      pendent upon the exertions of its parents or older
      brothers and sisters for support . During this
      time it was taught, by daily experieuce , habits of
      subordination to its seniors . The period at which
       it ranked itself by the side of the efficient portions
      of the household , was a happy medium between
      too early an application and too late a procras-
       tination of its physical energies ; for the child
      was sufficiently matured , in its material organiza-
      tion, to bear without injury moderate and con-
      tinued exertion ; and no time had , as yet, been
      allowed for the acquirement of slothful habits it
      came, too, at a time when the first impulses of
      puberty were beginning to stir new associations
      in his mind . These it checked by keeping him
      occupied, while he was removed from the in-
      fluence of bad example , and laboured in an open-
      workshop, free from the stimulus of warmth , and
      in the presence of his sisters , brothers , and pa-
      rents , --- the very best anodyne for allaying and
      keeping in due restraint his nascent passions , -
      whilst his moral and social instincts were under a
      process of incessant cultivation .

```
    The same observations apply with still greater
   force to the females of the family . With them
   labour commenced at a somewhat earlier period ,
   or they supplied the place of their mother in the
   household offices , leaving her at liberty to work
   for their sustenance, if such a course of proceed-
   ing was deemed necessary, or forced upon them
   by the pressure of circumstances . Whichever it
   was, she was kept from promiscuous intercourse
   with the other sex, at an age when it was to her
   of the utmost importance - her young sensibilities
   rendering her peculiarly liable to powerful and
    irresistible impressions . * It is true that the sports
   of her own sex were to some extent libidinous ; but
   to these she was not admitted till a much later
   period ; and these , though coarse and highly ob-
   jectionable, rarely ended in mischief, being con-
    sidered as a sort of prelude to marriage, uni-
   versally existing amongst them-a custom most
    certainly " more honoured in the breach than in
   the observance . "
    Her occupations and feelings were therefore
    exclusively home -bred , and no idea existed that
    distinct or detached interests could intervene be-
    twixt her parents and herself.
     It is in these respects that the family of the
    factory labourers offers such strong contrasts and
   unhappy differences .
     In the first place , there is no home labour. It

     becomes therefore a mere shelter, in which their
     meals are hastily swallowed , and which offers them
     repose for the night. It has no endearing re-
      collections which bind it on their memories- no
     hold upon their imaginations .
       In the next place , the various members not only
     do not labour under their own roof, but they do
     not labour in common , neither in one mill ; or
      if in one mill , so separated , that they have no
     opportunity of exchanging a single glance or a
     word throughout the long hours they are engaged
      there. Children are thus entirely removed from
     parental guardianship ; --and not only so , but they
     are brought into immediate contact with parties ,
     generally of their own age , equally removed with
     themselves from inspection , and equally un-
     checked by a consciousness that the eye of a
     brother, sister, or parent may be fixed upon
     them . They are placed , too , under the control of
     an overlooker, who from a sense of duty to his em-
     ployer, if aggravated by no baser feeling, treats
     them frequently with harshness , often with brutal
      coarseness, making no allowance for childish sim-
      plicity, bashfulness , delicacy, or female failings ;
     and this is most fatal to self-esteem , -for no-
     thing so soon injures or destroys this , as unworthy
     treatment, suffered in themselves or witnessed
     in others , without the power of redress or even
     of [appeal] .
      Again , they are subjected on all sides to the

    sphere, and have no occupation , save watching
    the passage of a thread or the revolution of a
    spindle . The mind is but little engaged [,] there [is]
    no variety for it to feed upon[ ,] -it has [none][ of][ the]
    pure excitements which home affords , -it be-
    comes crowded with images of the very [opposite]
    quality, and has its delicacy utterly and irre-
    trievably ruined , and no opportunity [is][ given][ for]
    the growth of modesty on the one hand[ ,][ or of][ the]
     social obligations of brother[,] sister [,] or[ child][ on]
    the other .
     The next evil which removes factory labour an-
    other step still more widely apart from the con-
    dition of domestic manufacture is , that the wages
    of children have become , either by universal con-
    sent, or by the growth of disobedience , payable to
    the person earning them . This has led to another
    crying and grievous misfortune ; namely, that each
    child ceases to view itself as a subordinate agent
    in the household ; so far indeed loses the cha-
     racter and bearing of a child , that it pays over to
     its natural protector a stated sum for food and
    lodging ; thus detaching itself from parental sub-
    jection and control . The members , therefore, of
    a spinner's or weaver's family become a body of
     distinct individuals , occupying occasionally, but
    by no means universally, the same home , each
    paying its quota to the joint expenses, and con-
     sidering themselves as lodgers merely, and appro-
     priating any surplus which may remain oftheir
    wages to their own private purposes , accountable

      repose for the night. It has no endearing re-
       collections which bind it on their memories- no
      hold upon their imaginations.
       In the next place , the various members not only
      do not labour under their own roof, but they do
      not labour in common , neither in one mill ; or
       if in one mill , so separated , that they have no
      opportunity of exchanging a single glance or a
      word throughout the long hours they are engaged
      there . Children are thus entirely removed from
      parental guardianship ; --and not only so, but they
      are brought into immediate contact with parties ,
      generally of their own age, equally removed with
      themselves from inspection , and equally un-
      checked by a consciousness that the eye of a
      brother, sister, or parent may be fixed upon
      them . They are placed , too , under the control of
      an overlooker, who from a sense of duty to his em-
      ployer, if aggravated by no baser feeling, treats
      them frequently with harshness , often with brutal
      coarseness, making no allowance for childish sim-
       plicity, bashfulness, delicacy , or female failings ;
      and this is most fatal to self-esteem,-for no-
      thing so soon injures or destroys this, as unworthy
      treatment, suffered in themselves or witnessed
      in others , without the power of redress or even
      of [appeal] .

     would , at all events, have prevented them from
      becoming obnoxious . They would , by taking away
      other and more influential causes , urging on early
      sexual and physical development, have partially
      removed the evils ever attendant upon the crowd-
      ing together great bodies of people. Powerful
       restrictions would have also been placed upon
      that relaxation of sexual decency -that abolition
      of delicate and refined sentiments , and social ob-
       ligations, which ever lead to barbarous modes of
       living, and to the ruin of many of the fairest por-
      tions of man's character.
       They have, however, been neglected or [over-]

     stances already detailed , are in full and undisguised

     extent painful to contemplate . The exhibitions
     of the utter absence of sexual delicacy, common
      *" On the subject of the general licentiousness and illicit in-
     tercourse between the sexes, which prevails in manufacturing
      districts, we cannot, for obvious reasons, dwell so long, nor as
     minutely, as the extreme importance of the subject would justify.
     In the few words we shall devote to this branch of our inves-
     tigation, we shall be careful to keep within the limits of the
     most scrupulous accuracy, and to affirm nothing which we
     do not possess the materials for proving . First, then, we shall
     remark, that nothing but personal observation , or the testimony
     of eye-witnesses, can be relied on for satisfactory information.
     The returns of illegitimate children are worse than useless-
     for it will be obvious , on a few moments' consideration, that in
     such cases they can afford us no possible criterion of the desired
     result. On this subject, some writers on political economy†
     betray the same ignorance as in the assertion of the extensive
     use of animal food among the manufacturing labourers . Both
     instances furnish an illustration of what appears to be a common
     source of error with them-- namely, a disposition to draw infe-
     rences from isolated facts, instead of resting their doctrines upon
     the basis of extension and accurate observation. They conclude,
     that because the proportion of illegitimate births appears to be
     greater among agricultural than among the manufacturing
     population, the females of the former are the more immoral
     of the two. We draw, without doubt or hesitation , exactly the
     opposite conclusion , and every one intimately acquainted with
     the south of Lancashire will bear us out in this opinion . The
     deduction we draw is also materially confirmed by the practice
     which, it is painful to state, is far from uncommon among the
     abandoned women of these districts, of destroying , prematurely,
     the fruit and evidence of their guilt . "-Enquiry, &c . p . 25.

      in manufacturing towns , are notorious to the most
      superficial observer. The robe of Arthur's mis-
      tress would be tried in vain on the great majority
      of the females .
       It is not denied that there are many girls who,
     from a coincidence of favourable causes , or from
      their possessing a higher and more just sense of
     what is due to themselves , escape some of the
     many evils which beset them , and grow up decent
     and moral women , fitted to make good wives and
     good mothers. These are, nevertheless , excep-
      tions ; not so rare as to be extremely remarkable ,
     but still standing out in strong relief from the
     mass to which they are attached .
      The causes which are so injurious to the fe-
     male , are operating, in a similar degree, and with
      similar force , upon the male, and produce pre-
      cisely similar effects , both upon his moral and
      physical organization .

           CHAPTER III .
     THE INFLUENCE OF THE SEPARATION OF [FAMILIES][,][ &][c][.]
     UPON THE MORAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF [THE]
      MANUFACTURING POPULATION [.]
      Domestic Manufacturer- Union of his Family-Its Consequences
       and Advantages-No Child -labour- Effects of this upon the Male
       and Female Portion of his Household described- Factory Labour-
       Destruction of Home- Separation of Families-Effects of these
       upon social Character- Payment of Wages to Children, its Evils
       described-Conversion of Homes into Lodging -houses- Loss of do-
       mestic Virtues, description of—Early Period at which Factory La-
       bour begins-The Mind, &c . of Childhood-Division of Families-
       Cultivation of Home Affections-Infancy of the Factory Child
       described Comparison of the Condition of the Agricultural La-
       bourer- Its Advantages- Domestic Economy- Non-existence of, in
       the Factory Woman- Separation of Man and Wife .
      It has been truly remarked by Bacon , that " the
     culture and manurance of mind in youth , hath
     such a forcible though unseen operation , as
     hardly any length of time or contention of labour,
     can countervail its influence ."
      The domestic manufacturer possessed one great
     advantage over the factory labourer, which was
     -that his occupation was carried on beneath the

      roof of his own cottage, and in the midst of
      his family also , that his children , growing up
     under his own eye , and around his fire - side , re-
      tained for him the respect and awe due to parental
      authority, by remaining members of one home
     and under the direction of one head .* By keep-
      ing up this natural and proper order of things , he
      secured one means of making his offspring do-
      mestic in their habits, and it was his own fault
      if their social character was not what it ought
      to be.
      So long as families were thus bound together
     by the strong link of interest and affection , each
     member in its turn , as it attained an age fitted for
     the loom , joined its labour to the general stock , its
      earnings forming part of a fund, the whole of
     which was placed at the disposal of the father or
     mother, as the case might be ; and each individual
      looked to him or to her for the adequate supply of
       its wants. No separate or distinct interests was
      ever acknowledged or dreamt of. If any one , by
      superior industry or skill, earned more in propor-
      tion than another, no separate claim was made
      for such excess on the part of that individual ; on
      the contrary, it was looked upon equally as a part
      of the wages ofthe family,—perhaps gratefully and
      affectionately acknowledged , but leading to no
      other result .
       This family compact, of course , existed no lon-

    ger than the usual period when parental control
    yields before the maturity of offspring . This was
    rarely before twenty - two or twenty-three years of
    age, and often much later. Grown up, as each
    member had , as part and parcel of a little com-
    munity, these divisions seldom took place before
    marriage opened a series of new cares and new
    prospects to son or daughter, which, in conse-
    quence seceded , or, as was frequently the case,
    brought a wife or husband to be joined to the
    family union . Generally , however, at this period
    an offset or branching took place, which was best
    for all parties.
     This preserved in all their vigour the moral
     obligations of father and mother , brother and
     sister, son and daughter, and that till a time of
     life was gained , which had given abundant oppor-
    tunity for the formation of character- a character
    most assuredly the best calculated to render the
    labouring man happy and virtuous , viz ., a do-
    mestic one ; without which, no adventitious aid
    can ever secure him their possession .
     The greatest misfortune-the most unfavour-
    able change which has resulted from factory la-
    bour, is the breaking up of these family ties ; the
    consequent abolition of the domestic circle , and
    the perversion of all the social obligations which
    should exist between parent and child on the
    one hand, and between children themselves on
    the other.
     The age at which a child became useful to its

      parents, so long as the great mass of manufactur-
      ing was manual and confined to private dwelling-
      houses , was from fourteen to sixteen . At an earlier
      age it was useful in a minor degree as winder ,
     & c.; but that was the period at which it became
     an auxiliary to the incomings of the family by
     working at the loom .
       Before this it was a mere child , entirely de-
      pendent upon the exertions of its parents or older
      brothers and sisters for support. During this
     time it was taught, by daily experieuce , habits of
      subordination to its seniors . The period at which
       it ranked itself by the side of the efficient portions
      of the household , was a happy medium between
      too early an application and too late a procras-
      tination of its physical energies ; for the child
     was sufficiently matured , in its material organiza-
      tion, to bear without injury moderate and con-
      tinued exertion ; and no time had , as yet , been
      allowed for the acquirement of slothful habits it
     came, too, at a time when the first impulses of
      puberty were beginning to stir new associations
      in his mind . These it checked by keeping him
      occupied , while he was removed from the in-
      fluence of bad example, and laboured in an open-
     workshop, free from the stimulus of warmth , and
      in the presence of his sisters , brothers, and pa-
      rents , the very best anodyne for allaying and
     keeping in due restraint his nascent passions, —
      whilst his moral and social instincts were under a
      process of incessant cultivation .

     The same observations apply with still greater
    force to the females of the family . With them
    labour commenced at a somewhat earlier period ,
    or they supplied the place of their mother in the
    household offices , leaving her at liberty to work
     for their sustenance, if such a course of proceed-
    ing was deemed necessary , or forced upon them
    by the pressure of circumstances . Whichever it
    was , she was kept from promiscuous intercourse
     with the other sex , at an age when it was to her
    of the utmost importance - her young sensibilities
     rendering her peculiarly liable to powerful and
     irresistible impressions . * It is true that the sports
     of her own sex were to some extent libidinous ; but
     to these she was not admitted till a much later
     period ; and these , though coarse and highly ob-
     jectionable, rarely ended in mischief, being con-
     sidered as a sort of prelude to marriage , uni-
     versally existing amongst them-a custom most
     certainly " more honoured in the breach than in
     the observance . "
      Her occupations and feelings were therefore
     exclusively home-bred , and no idea existed that
     distinct or detached interests could intervene be-
     twixt her parents and herself.
       It is in these respects that the family of the
     factory labourers offers such strong contrasts and
     unhappy differences .

     becomes therefore a mere shelter, in which their
     meals are hastily swallowed , and which offers them
      repose for the night. It has no endearing re-
      collections which bind it on their memories- no
     hold upon their imaginations .
       In the next place, the various members not only
     do not labour under their own roof, but they do
      not labour in common , neither in one mill ; or
      if in one mill , so separated , that they have no
      opportunity of exchanging a single glance or a
     word throughout the long hours they are engaged
      there. Children are thus entirely removed from
      parental guardianship ; --and not only so, but they
      are brought into immediate contact with parties,
      generally of their own age, equally removed with
     themselves from inspection , and equally un-
     checked by a consciousness that the eye of a
      brother, sister , or parent may be fixed upon

     them frequently with harshness, often with brutal
      coarseness, making no allowance for childish sim-
      plicity, bashfulness , delicacy, or female failings ;
     and this is most fatal to self-esteem , -for no-
      thing so soon injures or destroys this , as unworthy
     treatment, suffered in themselves or witnessed
      in others , without the power of redress or even

    sphere, and have no occupation , save watching
    the passage of a thread or the revolution of a
     spindle . The mind is but little engaged , there is
    no variety for it to feed upon [,] -it has none of the
    pure excitements which home affords , -it be-
    comes crowded with images of the very opposite
     quality, and has its delicacy utterly and irre-
     trievably ruined , and no opportunity is given [for]
     the growth of modesty on the one hand[ ,][ or] [of][ the]
     social obligations of brother, sister, or child on
     the other.
     The next evil which removes factory labour an-
     other step still more widely apart from the con-
     dition of domestic manufacture is , that the wages
    of children have become , either by universal con-
     sent, or by the growth of disobedience , payable to
     the person earning them . This has led to another
     crying and grievous misfortune ; namely, that each
     child ceases to view itself as a subordinate agent
     in the household ; so far indeed loses the cha-
     racter and bearing of a child , that it pays over to
      its natural protector a stated sum for food and
     lodging ; thus detaching itself from parental sub-
     jection and control . The members , therefore, of
    a spinner's or weaver's family become a body of
     distinct individuals , occupying occasionally, but
    by no means universally, the same home, each
     paying its quota to the joint expenses , and con-
     sidering themselves as lodgers merely, and appro-
     priating any surplus which may remain oftheir
     wages to their own private purposes , accountable

     to no one for the mode in which it happens to be
     used or wasted .
       It is to be feared , that the mischiefs resulting
     from such an unnatural arrangement, must , in the
      first instance , be saddled upon the errors of pa-
      rents- such a dereliction from filial duty being
     hardly likely to happen spontaneously on the side
     of the children ; and that a plan originally adopted
     in a few cases, by the family of idle and depraved
     parents , *- and many such are to be found , who
     would willingly batten upon the toil of their chil-
     dren- has become general , in consequence of the
     lowering in the reciprocal confidence and affection
     which ought to exist between parent and child .
      In numerous examples then [,] at the [present] day[,]
     parents are thus become the keepers of [lodging-]
     houses for their offspring, between whom little
     intercourse beyond that relating to pecuniary pro-
      fit and loss is carried on . In a vast number of
     others , children have been entirely driven away
     from their homes , either by unnatural treatment [,]
     or have voluntarily deserted them[ ,] and taken up
      their abode in other asylums , for the sake of
     saving a small sum in the amount of payment[ re-]
     quired for food and house- room [.]
      This disruption of all the ties of home, is one of
     the most fatal consequences of the factory system .

      ample opportunities of employment , is supported in idleness on

    The social relations which should distinguish the
    members ofthe same family, are destroyed . The
    domestic virtues- man's natural instincts , and the
     affections of the heart, are deadened and lost.
    Those feelings and actions which should be the
    charm of the fire- side-which should prepare
    young men and young women for fulfilling the
     duties of parents , are displaced by a selfishness
     utterly repugnant to all such sacred obligations .
    Tenderness of manner- solicitude during sickness

     are lost, and their place occupied by individual

     rarely before twenty -two or twenty-three years of

     family union . Generally, however, at this period
     an offset or branching took place , which was best
     for all parties.
      This preserved in all their vigour the moral
     obligations of father and mother, brother and
      sister, son and daughter, and that till a time of
      life was gained , which had given abundant oppor-
     tunity for the formation of character- a character
     most assuredly the best calculated to render the
     labouring man happy and virtuous, viz ., a do-
     mestic one ; without which, no adventitious aid
     can ever secure him their possession .
      The greatest misfortune-the most unfavour-
     able change which has resulted from factory la-
     bour, is the breaking up of these family ties ; the
     consequent abolition of the domestic circle , and
     the perversion of all the social obligations which
     should exist between parent and child on the
     one hand , and between children themselves on
     the other.

      repose for the night. It has no endearing re-

       In the next place , the various members not only
     do not labour under their own roof, but they do
      not labour in common , neither in one mill ; or
      if in one mill , so separated , that they have no
      opportunity of exchanging a single glance or a
     word throughout the long hours they are engaged
      there . Children are thus entirely removed from
      parental guardianship ; --and not only so, but they
      are brought into immediate contact with parties ,
      generally of their own age, equally removed with
      themselves from inspection , and equally un-
      checked by a consciousness that the eye of a
      brother, sister, or parent may be fixed upon
     them . They are placed , too , under the control of

    sphere, and have no occupation , save watching
    the passage of a thread or the revolution of a
    spindle. The mind is but little engaged [,] there [is]
    no variety for it to feed upon [,] -it has [none][ of][ the]
    pure excitements which home affords , -it be-
    comes crowded with images of the very [opposite]

    the growth of modesty on the one hand[ ,][ or][ of][ the]
     social obligations of brother[,] sister, or child on
    the other.
     The next evil which removes [factory] [labour][ an-]
    other step still more widely apart from the con-
     dition of domestic manufacture is, that the [wages]
    of children have become [,] either by [universal] [con-]
     sent, or by the growth of disobedience[ ,][ payable][ to]
    the person earning them [.] This has led to another
    crying and grievous misfortune [;] namely[,][ that][ each]
     child ceases to view itself as a subordinate [agent]
     in the household ; so far indeed [loses] [the][ cha-]
     racter and bearing of a child [,] that [it] pays [over][ to]
     its natural protector a stated sum [for] [food][ and]
     lodging ; thus detaching itself from parental sub-
     jection and control . The members, therefore, of
    a spinner's or weaver's family become [a][ body][ of]

    by no means universally[,] the same home[,][ each]
     paying its quota to the joint expenses[ ,][ and][ con-]

      to no one for the mode in which it happens to be
      used or wasted .
       It is to be feared , that the mischiefs resulting
      from such an unnatural arrangement, must, in the
       first instance , be saddled upon the errors of [pa-]
      rents- such a dereliction from filial duty being
      hardly likely to happen spontaneously on the [side]
      of the children ; and that a plan originally adopted
      in a few cases, by the family of idle and depraved
      parents, *- and many such are to be found [,] who
     would willingly batten upon the toil of their chil-
      dren-has become general , in consequence of the
      lowering in the reciprocal confidence and affection
     which ought to exist between parent and child[ .]
       In numerous examples then , at the [present] day[,]
      parents are thus become the keepers of [lodging-]
      houses for their offspring, between whom little
      intercourse beyond that relating to pecuniary pro-
       fit and loss is carried on [.] In a vast number of
      others , children have been entirely driven away
      from their homes , either by unnatural treatment [,]
      or have voluntarily deserted them [,] and taken [up]
      their abode in other asylums , for the sake of
      saving a small sum in the amount of payment re-
      quired for food and house -room.

      the most fatal consequences of the factory system .

    The social relations which should distinguish the
    members ofthe same family , are destroyed . The
    domestic virtues-man's natural instincts , and the
    affections of the heart , are deadened and lost .
    Those feelings and actions which should be the
    charm of the fire- side- which should prepare
    young men and young women for fulfilling the
    duties of parents , are displaced by a selfishness
    utterly repugnant to all such sacred obligations.
    Tenderness of manner-solicitude during sickness
    -the foregoing of personal gratification for the sake
    of others -- submission to home restraint- all these
     are lost , and their place occupied by individual
    independence- private avarice-the withholding

    of the more delicate shades of character, which
     render home a world of pleasures , leaving nothing

      conflicting individuals, each striving for their
     " own hand ," uninfluenced , unmodified by the
     more gentle , the more noble, and the more hu-
     manized cares, aspirations and feelings, which
      could alone render them estimable as fathers , mo-
      thers, brothers and sisters .
      When it is borne in mind, at what an early pe-
      riod of life this separation of family takes place,
       its effects will be better and more correctly appre-
      ciated , and the permanence of the injurious im-
      pression produced by it, will be more clearly
     comprehended .
       Factory labour, in many of its processes, re-
      quires little else but manual dexterity, and no
      physical strength ; neither is there any thing for
      the mind to do in it ; so that children , whose fin-
      gers are taught to move with great facility and
      rapidity, have all the requisites for it . Hence
     one reasonfor introducing mere infants into mills ,
     though this is by no means the only one ; and
     were the hours of labour sufficiently limited , and
     under proper regulation , when the present habits
      of their parents are considered , the evil-great in
     some respects as it is- would almost cease to be
     one. Children from nine to twelve years of age,
      are now become part of the staple hands , and are
      consequently subjected at this tender period to
       all the mischiefs incident to the condition of the
      older work-people.
        It may be urged , that the mind of a child at this

    age, cannot, from its very structure and previous
    impressions, be susceptible of the more vicious
    and immoral parts of the system ; and that its
    previous education, which it is presumed must
    have been home , will , to some extent, guard it
    against evil communications .
      It has been truly observed , and not the less
    beautifully than truly, that " heaven is around us
    in our infancy." This might have been extended ,
    and said , that " heaven is around and within us
    in our infancy ;" for the happiness of childhood
    springs full as much from an internal conscious-
    ness of delight, as from the novelty of its impres-
    sions from without . Its mind , providing the pas-
    sions are properly guided , is indeed a swelling
    fountain of all that is beautiful-all that is amiable ;
    -overflowing with joy and tenderness ; and its
    young heart is a living laboratory of love , formed
    to be profusely scattered on all around it.
     The very copiousness of its sensations , however,
    prevents stability in their direction , if not carefully
    tended-and if its heart and mind have capabili-
    ties for exhibiting and lavishing the treasures of
    their awakening energies , they are , from their very
    immaturity , more easily warped and misdirected
    The hacknied quotation, " just as the twig is
    bent," &c. , is not the less true for being hacknied .
    Most unhappily, every thing which goes on before
    the eyes of the unfortunate factory children , is
    but too well calculated to nip in the bud-to wi-
    ther in the spring time of its growth-the flower

     which was springing up within them, to adorn
     and beautify their future existence --and in its
     stead to bring forth an unsightly mass of ill-as-
     sorted and rugged excrescences , equally hateful
      to sight and injurious to the parent stem .
      The independence assumed by older brothers
     and sisters, the total inattention to parental re-
     monstrance or wishes , soon produce their influence
     upon a child-which is quite as ready to learn evil
     as good. Then , driven at the early age it is , into
     the mill , and at once placed amongst crowds of
     children similarly circumstanced with itself, the
     impressions made upon it at home soon become
     permanent. The subsequent possession of money,
     with the bickerings that arise therefrom, alien-
     ate any spark of affection which might still be
     lingering in its breast for its parents , and when a
     mere infant, it establishes itself either as an inde-
     pendent inmate of its paternal dwelling, or seeks
     out a lodging with other parties , as the case may
     happen to be.
      The existence of a divided interest in a house-
     hold , whether the division is between man and
     wife, or between parent and child , is alike fatal
      to its best interests . No home can ever be what
      it ought without proper government, or where
      all the inmates are on such terms of equa-
      lity as to give to each an equal right to the
      direction of the whole-and even a household so
     constituted will not hang long together . In the
     homes of the manufacturing population , the divi-

      sions between parents and children , arising from
     the assumption of managing their own earnings ,
      so generally acknowledged amongst them, de-
     prives them of the most valuable portion of their
     influence .
      Thus, whether at home or abroad , unfettered
     by wholesome restraints , the factory child grows
     up, acquiring vices of all shades , and utterly
      losing that which might render its condition one
     of respectability and comfort--the social and do-
     mestic virtues . Year after year rolls on , unfitting
      it more and more for the best purposes of life,
     and if it should become a parent, it transmits to
      its offspring the evils of a system of which it has
     been the victim .
      The entire breaking up of households , which is
     an inevitable consequence of mill-labour, as it
     now exists, is one which may be regarded as the
     most powerfully demoralizing agent attendant
     upon it. This is , however, aided by many other
     causes, some of which have been already de-
      scribed , and others will be noticed in the course
     of the work. * The domestic affections, if they
     are to assume strength, must be steadily cultivat-
     ed , and cultivated , too , in the only way of which
     they are capable. This is by parental kindness
     in the first place, which , by rendering home plea-
     sant, and weaving its delightful associations in

    the young imagination, forms one of the most
     sacred , most delightful, and most permanent feel-
     ings of the human heart. In the next place, the
    example of proper household subordination , for
    without this the first will be destroyed , or so
    weakened as to be inefficient and inoperative.
     Neither of these agents are brought to bear
     actively and properly upon the factory child .
    From its birth it sees nothing around it but dis-
     sension ; its infant cries are hushed, not by ma-
     ternal tenderness , but by doses of gin or opiates ,
     or it is left to wail itself asleep from exhaustion .
    In thousands of cases it is abandoned through-
     out the day by its parents , both of whom are
     egaged in the mill, and left to the care of a stranger
     or a mere child* -badly used - badly fed- its little
     heart hardened by harshness even in the cradle ;
     then badly clothed-unattended during its growth
    by regular and systematic kindness-constantly
     hearing execrations , curses , blasphemy, and every
     thing coarse and obscene in expression-seeing
     on all sides strife , drunkenness , beastiality, and
     abominations , and finally sent shivering into the
     mill, to swell the hordes of children which have
     been similarly educated , and similarly abandoned
     to their own resources.
      It may be said, that the agricultural labourer is
     subjected to a separation from his family, and that
     the members of his family are also , after a time,
     separated from home This is granted , and that,

     thus, prima facie, he appears circumstanced in
      these respects like the factory labourer[.] Nothing
     can, however, be more dissimilar than the two
      cases , when looked at in their true bearings[ .]
      The agricultural labourer, it is true , pursues his
     occupation from home-but he pursues it in nine
      cases out of ten solitarily, or ifhe works in company,
       it is in small gangs ; he works too in an atmo-
      sphere natural in its temperature , and favourable
      to bodily health , saying nothing of the moral in-
      fluences of the sights and sounds which are his
      familiar companions ; his labour is physically se-
      vere, and is just sufficient to require what intel-
      lectual capacity he generally possesses ; his diet
      is plain and wholesome ; he is freed from the ex-
     ample of many vices, by his situation, to which
     the factory labourer is exposed , and his habits and
     modes of life are simpler and purer. His family,
      separated from each other, and from home after a
      time, remain long enough under the paternal
      roof to have acquired some notion of domestic
      discipline , and that too under the best of all possible
      teachers a mother, whose avocations are exclu-
      sively household . The labour of the sons , when
      old enough to pursue it , which is not till sixteen
      years of age , is that of the father, under similar
      circumstances. The daughters become household
      servants, either to persons of their own class , or ,
     what is more general , in the houses of respectable
      families in the neighbourhood , or seek service in

    the surrounding towns and villages ; their family
     interest thus, of course, merging in that of their
    employers. In all these cases a strict watch is
    kept over their morals .† No point of similarity
     exists then between them , except in the single one
     of separation of families , and that too at a period
    and in a way to be as little injurious as possible
     to the moral character of the parties.
     The agricultural labourer has other moral ad-
     vantages over those possessed by the manufac-
     turing one. He is frequently under the direct
     inspection of his employer, in the middle class of
     land proprietors, or respectable land - holders ; and
     in the inferior order of both these, he is the per-
     sonal assistant, and works in conjunction with it.
     In the highest order, he has the reflected benefit
     of hereditary rank and wealth, circumstances of
    more importance than the superficial observer is
     aware of, but which are rendered sufficiently ap-
     parent by examining into the condition of the
     cottagers and labourers upon those estates which
       Nine-tenths of domestic female [servants][,] both in the [me-]
      tropolis and in all large towns, come from agricultural [districts][ .]
     So strong is the prejudice existing against town[-]bred[ servants] [,]
      that many families absolutely [refuse] to take [them][ under][ any]
      circumstances .
          It may be safely affirmed, that the virtue of female
      chastity does not exist amongst the lower orders of England,
      except to a certain extent among domestic female servants, who
     know that they hold their situations by that tenure, and are
     more prudent in consequence."-Report of Poor Laws' Com-
      mission.

     are benefited by the residence of their proprie-
     tors .
      These are a few of the moral advantages which
     he possesses still, to some extent, over the factory
     labourer. Of late years , indeed , the breaking-up

    the surrounding towns and villages ; their family
     interest thus, of course, merging in that of their
    employers . In all these cases a strict watch is
    kept over their morals . No point of similarity
     exists then between them , except in the single one
    of separation of families, and that too at a period
    and in a way to be as little injurious as possible
     to the moral character of the parties.
     The agricultural labourer has other moral ad-
     vantages over those possessed by the manufac-
     turing one. He is frequently under the direct
     inspection of his employer, in the middle class of
     land proprietors , or respectable land -holders ; and
     in the inferior order of both these, he is the per-
     sonal assistant, and works in conjunction with it
     In the highest order, he has the reflected benefit
     of hereditary rank and wealth, circumstances of
    more importance than the superficial observer is
     aware of, but which are rendered sufficiently ap-
     parent by examining into the condition of the
     cottagers and labourers upon those estates which
      * Nine-tenths of domestic female servants, both in the me-
      tropolis and in all large towns, come from agricultural districts.
     So strong is the prejudice existing against town-bred servants,
      that many families absolutely refuse to take them under any
      circumstances.
           66 It may be safely affirmed, that the virtue of female
      chastity does not exist amongst the lower orders of England,
      except to a certain extent among domestic female servants, who
     know that they hold their situations by that tenure , and are
     more prudent in consequence."-Report of Poor Laws' Com-
      mission.

     are benefited by the residence of their proprie-
     tors.
      These are a few ofthe moral advantages which
     he possesses still, to some extent, over the factory
     labourer. Of late years , indeed , the breaking-up
     of small farms- and other causes, have brought
     into operation upon him, the demoralizing agency
     of poverty and want of employ, and its influence
     has done much to deprive him of many of the be-
     nefits he once enjoyed .
      In addition to the enumeration already given of

     and the early age at which children are impressed

     THERE is nothing which so truly marks the
    character of a community, in a moral point of
    view, as domestic manners ; nothing which affords
    so correct and decided a criterion by which a
    judgment may be formed of its happiness and
    comfort. Politically speaking, the common people
    may be a dead letter, whilst their homes
    exhibit private independence and social enjoy-
    ment. Politically speaking, a people may possess
    many immunities -many rights-may even exer-
     cise a very marked control over the actions of their

      rulers , whilst their homes exhibit social disorgan-
      ization and moral worthlessness .
      The social confederacy of the present genera-
      tion is full of anomalies. Possessing, as the great
      bulk of the population does, many advantages
        ་ ་ never known or dreamt of by their forefathers ;
      education rapidly progressing ; its wants liberally
      relieved ; its sicknesses carefully tended ; religion
      afforded it, nay, even brought to its doors , and
      applied to its senses ; a practicability of earning
      something towards a livelihood ; continual ac-
      cessions of political privileges - it is nevertheless
      filled with immorality, irreligion, improvidence,
      political discontent, refusal to earn anything, in-
      gratitude, ignorance , and vice , in every con-
      ceivable form in which it can develop itself.
       Neither are these evils confined to one class
     of the labouring commmunity, proving very suffi-
      ciently that other causes must be at work beyond
      those dependent upon manufacture, on the one
     hand, and agriculture on the other. Neither is
      the excess of the existing demoralization less in

     the agricultural than in the commercial districts,
     though the one is a scattered population , and the
      other is gathered together in towns or crowded
      localities, circumstances in themselves unfavour-
      able to health and morals ; the former of which are
     consequently freed from many of those causes of
     declension which powerfully influence the latter.

   tive , is one singularly unfavourable to domesticity .
   Rising at or before day-break , between four and
    five o'clock the year round , scarcely refreshed by
   his night's repose, he swallows a hasty meal , or
   hurries to the mill without taking any food what-
   ever. At eight o'clock half an hour, and in some
   instances forty minutes , are allowed for breakfast .
   In many cases , the engine continues at work
   during mealtime , obliging the labourer to eat and
    still overlook his work. This , however , is not
   universal. This meal is brought to the mill , and
   generally consists of weak tea , of course nearly
   cold , with a little bread ; in other instances, of
   milk-and-meal porridge . Tea, however, may be
   called the universal breakfast , flavoured of late
   years too often with gin or other stimulants .
   Where the hands live in immediate proximity to
   the mill, they visit home ; but this rarely happens ,
   as they are collected from all parts, some far,
   some near ; but the majority too remote to leave
   the mill for that purpose . After this he is inces-
   santly engaged- not a single minute of rest or
   relaxation being allowed him.
    At twelve o'clock the engine stops , and an hour
   is given for dinner . The hands leave the mill ,
   and seek their homes, where this meal is usually
   taken . It consists of potatoes boiled ; very often
   eaten alone ; sometimes with a little bacon , and
   sometimes with a portion of animal food . This
    latter is , however , only found at the tables of the
   more provident and reputable workmen . If, as

```

```
       it often happens , the majority of the labourers
      reside at some distance , a great portion of the
       allotted time is necessarily taken up by the walk ,
      or rather run , backwards and forwards . No time
       is allowed for the observances of ceremony. The
      meal has been imperfectly cooked , by some one
       left for that purpose, not unusually a mere child ,
      or superannuated man or woman . The entire
      family surround the table, if they possess one ,
      each striving which can most rapidly devour the
      miserable fare before them, which is sufficient ,
      by its quantity , to satisfy the cravings of hunger,
      but possesses little nutritive quality. It is not
      half masticated ; is hastily swallowed in crude
      morsels , and thrust into the stomach in a state
      unfavourable to the progress of those subsequent
      changes which it ought to undergo. As soon as
       this is effected , the family is again scattered . No
       rest has been taken ; and even the exercise , such
      as it is , is useless , from its excess , and even
      harmful , being taken at a time when repose is
      necessary for the digestive operations .
       Again they are closely immured from one
      o'clock till eight or nine , with the exception of
      twenty minutes , this being allowed for tea, or
      baggin-time, as it is called . This imperfect meal
       is almost universally taken in the mill : it consists
      of tea and wheaten bread, with very few excep-
      tions . During the whole of this long period they
      are actively and unremittingly engaged in a
      crowded room and an elevated temperature , so

    that, when finally dismissed for the day, they are
    exhausted equally in body and mind .
      It must be remembered , that father, mother,
    son, and daughter, are alike engaged ; no one
    capable of working is spared to make home (to
    which, after a day of such toil and privation , they
    are hastening ) comfortable and desirable . No
    clean and tidy wife appears to welcome her hus-
    band - no smiling and affectionate mother to
    receive her children — no home , cheerful and in-
    viting, to make it regarded . On the contrary , all
    assemble there equally jaded ; it is miserably
    furnished- dirty and squalid in its appearance ..
    Another meal , sometimes of a better quality , is
    now taken, and they either seek that repose
    which is so much needed , or leave home in the
    pursuit of pleasure or amusements, which still
    farther tend to increase the evils under which
    they unavoidably labour .
     The staple diet of the manufacturing population
     is potatoes and wheaten bread , washed down by
    tea or coffee.* Milk is but little used . Meal is
    consumed to some extent, either baked into cakes
     * The increased consumption of tea and coffee[,][ as] [compared]
     to the increase in population [,] shows the change[ in][ the][ habits]
     which has been going on so rapidly during the [present][ century][.]
    The quantity of sugar consumed in 1814 [was][ 1,997,000lbs] [.][ ;]
     in 1832, 3,655,000 lbs . , an increase of 83 per cent[.][ ;][ increase][ in]
     population, 24 per cent [.] ; tea, in 1814 [,] 19,224,000 [lbs][.;] [1832][,]

      or boiled up with water, making a [porridge][ at]
      once nutritious , easy of digestion , and readily
      cooked . Animal food forms a very small part of
      their diet, and that which is eaten is often of an
      inferior quality. In the class of fine spinners and
      others , whose wages are very liberal [,] flesh meat [is]
      frequently added to their meals[.] Fish is bought
      to some extent, though by no [means] very[ largely][ ;]
      and even this not till it has undergone [slight] [de-]
      composition, having been first exposed in the mar-
      kets, and , being unsaleable , is then hawked about
      the back streets and alleys [,] where it is disposed of
      for a mere trifle . Herrings are eaten not un-
      usually ; and though giving a relish to their
      otherways tasteless food, are not very well
       fitted for their use. The process of salting,
      which hardens the animal fibre [,] renders [it] difficult
      of digestion, dissolving slowly [,] and their stomachs
      do not possess the most active or energetic [cha-]
      racter. Eggs , too, form some portion of the ope-
       ratives ' diet . The staple, however, is tea and
      bread . Little trouble is required in preparing
      them for use ; and this circumstance, joined to
      the want of proper domestic arrangements[,][ favours]
       their extensive use amongst a class so [improvident]
      and careless as the operative [manufacturers][ .]
       Tobacco is very largely consumed by the male
      and female labourers indiscriminately ; hundreds
      of men and women may be daily seen inhaling
      the fumes of this extraordinary plant, by means

    of short and blackened pipes . * Smoking, too , is
   an almost universal accompaniment to drinking-
   a pernicious habit, as will be shortly seen , pre-
    vailing to a frightful extent in this portion of the
   population .
    The difference exhibited both by the [buyers]
   and sellers of animal and vegetable food on the
   Saturday, which is the general provision [market-]
   day and the pay -day of the labourers[,] in the [morn-]
   ing and evening, very strikingly illustrates the[ dif-]
    ferent grades into which the community of a
    manufacturing town or district is divided [.]
     Speaking generally, the markets are well sup-
    plied , both as regards quality and quantity.
   Animal food , consisting of beef, mutton , veal, and
   pork , is plentiful , and of the best sorts - certainly
   not surpassed by any market in the kingdom .
   Vegetables are equally abundant and of an equally
   good quality . Lancashire has indeed long been
   famous for the excellence of its potatoes, a native
    rarely meeting with any fit to be compared
   with them for growth and flavour . Cheese , flour,
    butter, &c . &c . , are also in like manner good and
   abundant-in short, there is nothing eatable but
   what may be found at a moderate price and in any
    quantity.
     * The consumption of tobacco has increased from 1814 to
    1832 , from 15,000,000lbs. to 20,000,000 lbs, that is, about
    31 per cent. against an increase in population of 24 per cent.
    It is much less used now than formerly by the upper and
    middle classes.

       In the morning the markets are crowded with
      well-dressed respectable persons making their
     purchases for the ensuing week-order, civility,
     decency being preserved as far as these things
     can be on such occasions . The best animal
     food , whether it be flesh , fish , or fowl , is of course
       first carried away to the larders and cellars of the
     middle and upper classes, and the same with the
      vegetables . The day wears on , and about noon
     a change is observable in the appearance of the
     markets . The morning's trading had pretty well
      cleared them , a tolerably accurate balance being
      preserved between the supply of prime and first-
      rate articles, and the probable demand . At this
     time they are beginning to fill again--the butchers'
      stalls are replenished-the vegetables start into
     being the sides of the streets in the principal
     market thoroughfares become lined with baskets
      or petty stalls, the property of sellers of every
      variety of minor article likely to tempt the cupi-
      dity or taste of vulgarity .
       It might be supposed that a supply of similar
      quality to that of the morning was now to be found ,
     -but it is widely different. Coarse- badly fed-
      too long kept, and not unfrequently diseased animal
     food, stands in the room of the excellent article of
     the morning. The vegetables have undergone
     an equal deterioration , consisting of the refuse of
     the morning's supply. These are retailed out,
     not by the respectable dealer or grower, but
     by a congregation of small buyers who have

    selected their stocks , not from their excellence[ ,]
    but from their cheapness ; -and the same inferi-
    ority holds throughout. And what a scene is
    Saturday night's market- what a hubbub of [dis-]
    cordant sounds — what jangling [,] swearing[ ,] drunken-
    ness , noisy vociferation , confusion worse con-
    founded, riot and debauchery . Thus passes
    Saturday till near midnight- a scene of turmoil[,]
     strife , and roguery .
     If the perfection of social and domestic life
    consisted in limiting and stinting the supplies of
    man's natural wants , as to food - or if this perfec-
    tion consisted less in the limiting these supplies ,
    than in an indifference as to their quality, —a very
    great portion of the lowest classes in the great manu-
    facturing towns are rapidly approaching , or rather
    have already nearly approached perfection . If
    true wisdom , as to eating, consists in simply satisfy-
    ing the cravings of appetite , without reference to
    the nature or place of doing this-then do these
    people exhibit a high order of wisdom . There is,
    however, an intimate relation between moral
   and domestic virtues and modes of living . The
    Irish hand-loom weaver, who rarely tastes any
    food but potatoes , has reduced his scale of living
    to its utmost simplicity, and he holds the lowest
    rank in the very low classes even in these situa-
    tions. Recklessness and improvidence may be
    ever detected by coarse , inferior, and badly
    cooked diet. Poverty , even in its very extremity,
    if still retaining any trace of self-respect, any

      tincture of a wish or hope for better things, will
      have its meals, even though they may be hardly
     worthy the name, with a regard to common de-
      cency and decorum . The savage who feeds pro-
      miscuously upon whatever comes before him,
     from his own species to ants and caterpillars ,
      affords by this very omnivorousness, the most
      decisive proofs of his want of civilization, and
      domestic forethought and economy. So does the
     workman, in a different order of society, who con-
      sumes the refuse merely of those around him ,
      without regard to its quality, he proclaims, if
      possible, in still more decided language , the extent
      of his moral and social debasement.
      The mere supply of the wants of nature, with
      respect to food , absorbs but a very small amount
      of the wages earned by the majority of the manu-
      facturing labourers- confined as the supply is to
      the coarsest and most simple viands . Men máy
      be found who have not yielded to the indifference
      and destructive habits of the mass, who are living
      in comfort and decency upon the average amount
      of wages earned by the whole population- a suf-
       ficient proof, if proof were wanting , that the mis-
      chief lies full as much with the labourers them-
      selves, as in the system of labour ; -bad as that
       is acknowledged to be.
       The extinction of decent pride in their house-
      hold establishments , which at present character-
      izes the mass of the manufacturing population ,
      presents them in a very unfavourable point of view.

    There are none of the minor comforts of existence .
    nothing but a hut of squalor and filth , alike repul-
    sive to sight and smell and injurious to health-
    having few of the requisites of home, except as a
    place of mere shelter. It is stripped of every thing
    which might render it pleasant or delightful , and
    has in consequence no hold upon the affections .
   The labourer leaves it without regrethe antici-
    pates no joy on his return- he finds there no-
    thing but want and all these are in a great mea-
    sure the results , not ofthe pressure of actual want,
   but of his own bad and improvident habits .
    The pure and quiet joys of home, may indeed
    never have been known either to himself or his
    family ; but surely there is within the human
    heart even within their hearts, hardened and
   debased as they are some yearning after domes-
         -
    tie bliss some faint glimmer of a better and
    purer order of things some longing to shake off
   a condition of life, that, like an incubus, presses
   upon and destroys all the best energies of their
    nature .
    The operative having no home which can cheer
    the brief period allowed him from labour- des-
    titute of moral principle, unguided and uninflu-
    enced by good example- flies for relief to
    the gin -vault or the beer-house , dissipating in
    these haunts of crime and depravity, resources
   which, if properly applied , would furnish his house
    decently, supply his table with wholesome and
    nutritious food , and provide him with ample

     means to make him a respectable member of so-
      ciety .
      The plainness and want of solidity and proper
      stimulus in the food of the labourer, is attended
     by some other evils, bearing strongly upon his
      domestic habits .
       His labour is continued so uninterruptedly[ ,][ that]
      whether it is morning[,] or noon[ ,] or night [,][ he][ leaves]
      the mill or work-shop , and devours his watery [meal]
      with feelings of such mental depression [and][ bodily]
      exhaustion that he eagerly swallows a stimulus[ in]
      the shape of spirits or beer[,] to supply by[ its][ tem-]
      porary exciting influence the want of proper [food]
      on the one hand , and of due relaxation on [the][ other][.]
       This habit ofdram-drinking, so fatal in its conse-
      quences , is of the most extensive prevalence . By
      satisfying the cravings for support , and by rousing
      into activity the mental faculties , the labourers ,
      male as well as female , swallow the pernicious
      draught, and bless it as the boon which relieves them
      from their harassed sensations . They resemble in
      this respect the hypochondriac , who flies madly to a
      stimulant which in his better senses he deprecates
      and avoids as a curse ; but there is this lamentable
      difference- that the labourers have no lucid inter
      vals , no return of correct sensations . Day after
      day their toil is accumulated upon them. Deprived
      of the cheering influence of the face of Nature ,
      robbed of the pure breath of heaven, cooped up
      in crowded buildings , with the Babel -like sounds
      of their companions, animate and inanimate, their

    overstrained minds and bodies know no return to

    deeper into the whirlpool , till they neither know
    their danger , nor , if they did [,] could they avoid or
    escape it, without a moral discipline [,] a physical
    regeneration , which at present appear, if not
    utterly hopeless , at least very remote[ .]
    The increase which has of late years taken
    place in the number of gin-vaults , and the more
    than equal increase in the number of low beer-
    houses since the passing of the bill termed the
   Beer Bill , though its more correct designation

      or boiled up with water, making a porridge at
      once nutritious , easy of digestion, and readily
      cooked. Animal food forms a very small part of
      their diet, and that which is eaten is often of an
       inferior quality. In the class of fine spinners and
      others, whose wages are very liberal , flesh meat is
      frequently added to their meals. Fish is bought
      to some extent , though by no means very largely ;
      and even this not till it has undergone slight de-
      composition, having been first exposed in the mar-
      kets , and, being unsaleable , is then hawked about
      the back streets and alleys, where it is disposed of
      for a mere trifle . Herrings are eaten not un-
      usually ; and though giving a relish to their
      otherways tasteless food, are not very well
       fitted for their use . The process of salting,
      which hardens the animal fibre , renders it difficult
      of digestion, dissolving slowly, and their stomachs
      do not possess the most active or energetic cha-
      racter. Eggs , too, form some portion ofthe ope-
      ratives' diet. The staple, however, is tea and
      bread . Little trouble is required in preparing
      them for use ; and this circumstance, joined to
      the want of proper domestic arrangements , favours
      their extensive use amongst a class so improvident
      and careless as the operative manufacturers .
       Tobacco is very largely consumed by the male
      and female labourers indiscriminately ; hundreds
      of men and women may be daily seen inhaling
      the fumes of this extraordinary plant, by means

   of short and blackened pipes .* Smoking, too , is
   an almost universal accompaniment to drinking-
   a pernicious habit, as will be shortly seen, pre-
   vailing to a frightful extent in this portion of the
   population .
    The difference exhibited both by the buyers
   and sellers of animal and vegetable food on the
   Saturday, which is the general provision market-
   day and the pay - day of the labourers , in the morn-
   ing and evening, very strikingly illustrates the dif-
   ferent grades into which the community of a
   manufacturing town or district is divided .
    Speaking generally, the markets are well sup-
   plied , both as regards quality and quantity.
   Animal food, consisting of beef, mutton, veal , and
   pork, is plentiful , and of the best sorts- certainly
   not surpassed by any market in the kingdom .
   Vegetables are equally abundant and of an equally
   good quality. Lancashire has indeed long been
   famous for the excellence of its potatoes, a native
   rarely meeting with any fit to be compared
   with them for growth and flavour . Cheese , flour,
    butter, & c . & c . , are also in like manner good and
   abundant- in short, there is nothing eatable but
   what may be found at a moderate price and in any
    quantity .
     * The consumption of tobacco has increased from 1814 to
    1832 , from 15,000,000lbs. to 20,000,000 lbs , that is, about
    31 per cent. against an increase in population of 24 per cent.
    It is much less used now than formerly by the upper and
    middle classes.

      In the morning the markets are crowded with
     well-dressed respectable persons making their
     purchases for the ensuing week-order, civility,
     decency being preserved as far as these things
     can be on such occasions . The best animal
     food , whether it be flesh , fish, or fowl , is of course
      first carried away to the larders and cellars of the
     middle and upper classes , and the same with the
      vegetables . The day wears on , and about noon
     a change is observable in the appearance of the
     markets. The morning's trading had pretty well
      cleared them, a tolerably accurate balance being
     preserved between the supply of prime and first-
      rate articles, and the probable demand . At this
     time they are beginning to fill again--the butchers '
      stalls are replenished-the vegetables start into
     being the sides of the streets in the principal
     market thoroughfares become lined with baskets
      or petty stalls , the property of sellers of every
      variety of minor article likely to tempt the cupi-
      dity or taste of vulgarity.
       It might be supposed that a supply of similar
      quality to that of the morning was now to be found ,
     -but it is widely different . Coarse- badly fed-
     too long kept , and not unfrequently diseased animal
     food, stands in the room of the excellent article of
     the morning . The vegetables have undergone
     an equal deterioration , consisting of the refuse of
     the morning's supply. These are retailed out,
     not by the respectable dealer or grower, but
    by a congregation of small buyers who have

    selected their stocks, not from their excellence[ ,]
    but from their cheapness [;] —and the same inferi-
    ority holds throughout[.] And what a scene is
    Saturday night's market- what a hubbub [of][ dis-]
    cordant sounds- what jangling [,] swearing [,] [drunken-]
    ness, noisy vociferation , confusion worse con-
    founded, riot and debauchery . Thus passes
    Saturday till near midnight- a scene of turmoil[ ,]
     strife, and roguery .
     If the perfection of social and domestic life
    consisted in limiting and stinting the supplies of
    man's natural wants , as to food - or if this perfec-
    tion consisted less in the limiting these supplies ,
    than in an indifference as to their quality, -a very
    great portion of the lowest classes in the great manu-
    facturing towns are rapidly approaching, or rather
    have already nearly approached perfection . If
    true wisdom , as to eating , consists in simply satisfy-
    ing the cravings of appetite , without reference to
    the nature or place of doing this- then do these
    people exhibit a high order of wisdom. There is ,
    however, an intimate relation between moral
    and domestic virtues and modes of living . The
    Irish hand-loom weaver, who rarely tastes any
    food but potatoes, has reduced his scale of living
    to its utmost simplicity, and he holds the lowest
    rank in the very low classes even in these situa-
    tions . Recklessness and improvidence may be
    ever detected by coarse , inferior, and badly
    cooked diet. Poverty, even in its very extremity,
    if still retaining any trace of self-respect, any

      tincture of a wish or hope for better things , will
      have its meals , even though they may be hardly
      worthy the name, with a regard to common de-
      cency and decorum . The savage who feeds pro-
      miscuously upon whatever comes before him ,
      from his own species to ants and caterpillars ,
       affords by this very omnivorousness , the most
      decisive proofs of his want of civilization , and
      domestic forethought and economy. So does the
      workman, in a different order of society, who con-
      sumes the refuse merely of those around him,
      without regard to its quality, he proclaims, if
      possible, in still more decided language, the extent
      of his moral and social debasement.
       The mere supply of the wants of nature, with
      respect to food , absorbs but a very small amount
        • of the wages earned by the majority of the manu-
            -
      facturing labourers confined as the supply is to
      the coarsest and most simple viands . Men may
      be found who have not yielded to the indifference
      and destructive habits of the mass, who are living
       in comfort and decency upon the average amount
      of wages earned by the whole population- a suf-
       ficient proof, if proof were wanting, that the mis-
       chief lies full as much with the labourers them-
       selves, as in the system of labour ; -bad as that
       is acknowledged to be.
       The extinction of decent pride in their house-
      hold establishments , which at present character-
       izes the mass of the manufacturing population,
       presents them in a very unfavourable point of view.

    There are none of the minor comforts of existence-
    nothing but a hut of squalor and filth , alike repul-
     sive to sight and smell and injurious to health-
    having few of the requisites of home, except as a
    place of mere shelter. It is stripped of every thing
    which might render it pleasant or delightful , and
    has in consequence no hold upon the affections .
    The labourer leaves it without regrethe antici-
    pates no joy on his return- he finds there no-
    thing but want-and all these are in a great mea-
    sure the results , not ofthe pressure of actual want,
    but of his own bad and improvident habits .
     The pure and quiet joys of home, may indeed
    never have been known either to himself or his
    family ; but surely there is within the human
    heart even within their hearts, hardened and
    debased as they are some yearning after domes-
     tie bliss-some faint glimmer of a better and
    purer order of things - some longing to shake off
    a condition of life, that, like an incubus, presses
    upon and destroys all the best energies of their
    nature .
     The operative having no home which can cheer
    the brief period allowed him from labour-des-
     titute of moral principle, unguided and uninflu-
    enced by good example- flies for relief to
    the gin -vault or the beer-house, dissipating
    these haunts of crime and depravity, resources
    which, if properly applied , would furnish his house
    decently, supply his table with wholesome and
    nutritious food , and provide him with ample

     means to make him a respectable member of so-
      ciety .
      The plainness and want of solidity and proper
      stimulus in the food of the labourer, is attended
     by some other evils, bearing strongly upon his
      domestic habits .
       His labour is continued so uninterruptedly[,][ that]
      whether it is morning, or noon [,] or night[,] he [leaves]
      the mill or work- shop , and devours his watery [meal]
      with feelings of such mental depression and [bodily]
      exhaustion that he eagerly swallows a stimulus [in]
      the shape of spirits or beer[,] to supply by[ its][ tem-]
      porary exciting influence the want of proper [food]
      on the one hand , and of due relaxation on [the][ other][.]
       This habit ofdram- drinking , so fatal in its conse-
      quences , is of the most extensive prevalence . By
      satisfying the cravings for support , and by rousing
      into activity the mental faculties , the labourers ,
      male as well as female , swallow the pernicious
      draught, and bless it as the boon which relieves them
      from their harassed sensations . They resemble in
       this respect the hypochondriac , who flies madly to a
      stimulant which in his better senses he deprecates
      and avoids as a curse ; but there is this lamentable
      difference- that the labourers have no lucid inter
      vals , no return of correct sensations . Day after
      day their toil is accumulated upon them . Deprived
      of the cheering influence of the face of Nature ,
      robbed of the pure breath of heaven, cooped up
      in crowded buildings, with the Babel -like sounds

    overstrained minds and bodies know no return to
    healthy feelings , and they plunge deeper and
    deeper into the whirlpool, till they neither know
    their danger, nor, if they did , could they avoid or
    escape it, without a moral discipline, a physical
    regeneration, which at present appear, if not
    utterly hopeless , at least very remote.
    The increase which has of late years taken
    place in the number of gin-vaults , and the more
   than equal increase in the number of low beer-
   houses since the passing of the bill termed the
   Beer Bill, though its more correct designation
   would have been a " bill for the demoralization
   of the working classes "-is sufficiently indicative
   of the prevalence of dram-drinking and tavern-

       is allowed for the observances of ceremony. The
      meal has been imperfectly cooked , by some one
       left for that purpose , not unusually a mere child ,
      or superannuated man or woman . The entire
      family surround the table, if they possess one,
      each striving which can most rapidly devour the
      miserable fare before them , which is sufficient,
      by its quantity, to satisfy the cravings of hunger,
      but possesses little nutritive quality. It is not
      half masticated ; is hastily swallowed in crude
      morsels , and thrust into the stomach in a state
      unfavourable to the progress of those subsequent
      changes which it ought to undergo. As soon as
       this is effected, the family is again scattered . No
       rest has been taken ; and even the exercise , such
       as it is , is useless , from its excess , and even
      harmful, being taken at a time when repose is
      necessary for the digestive operations .
       Again they are closely immured from one
      o'clock till eight or nine , with the exception of
      twenty minutes, this being allowed for tea, or
      baggin-time, as it is called . This imperfect meal
       is almost universally taken in the mill : it consists
      of tea and wheaten bread , with very few excep-
      tions . During the whole of this long period they
      are actively and unremittingly engaged in a
      crowded room and an elevated temperature , so

    that, when finally dismissed for the day, they are
    exhausted equally in body and mind .
     It must be remembered , that father , mother,
    son, and daughter, are alike engaged ; no one
    capable of working is spared to make home (to
    which , after a day of such toil and privation , they
    are hastening) comfortable and desirable . No
    clean and tidy wife appears to welcome her hus-
    band - no smiling and affectionate mother to
    receive her children - no home , cheerful and in-
    viting, to make it regarded . On the contrary, all
    assemble there equally jaded ; it is miserably
    furnished-dirty and squalid in its appearance .
    Another meal , sometimes of a better quality , is
    now taken, and they either seek that repose
    which is so much needed , or leave home in the
    pursuit of pleasure or amusements, which still
    farther tend to increase the evils under which
    they unavoidably labour.
     The staple diet of the manufacturing population
     is potatoes and wheaten bread , washed down by
    tea or coffee. * Milk is but little used . Meal is
    consumed to some extent, either baked into cakes
     * The increased consumption of tea and [coffee][,][ as][ compared]
     to the increase in population [,] shows the change[ in][ the][ habits]
    which has been going on so rapidly during the [present][ century][.]
    The quantity of sugar consumed in 1814 [was][ 1,997,000lbs][.][ ;]
     in 1832, 3,655,000 lbs [.] , an increase of 83 [per][ cent][.;][ increase][ in]

      or boiled up with water, making a [porridge][ at]
      once nutritious , easy of digestion , and readily
      cooked. Animal food forms a very small part of
      their diet, and that which is eaten is often of [an]
       inferior quality. In the class of fine spinners and
      others , whose wages are very liberal [,] flesh meat [is]
      frequently added to their meals [.] Fish is bought
      to some extent, though by no means very[ largely][ ;]
      and even this not till it has undergone [slight] [de-]
      composition, having been first exposed in the mar-
      kets, and , being unsaleable , is then hawked about
      the back streets and alleys , where it is [disposed][ of]
       for a mere trifle . Herrings are eaten not un-
      usually ; and though giving a relish to their
      otherways tasteless food , are notnot very well
       fitted for their use. The process of salting,
      which hardens the animal fibre , renders it difficult
      of digestion , dissolving slowly, and their stomachs
      do not possess the most active or energetic [cha-]
       racter. Eggs , too , form some portion of the ope-
       ratives' diet. The staple, however, is tea and
      bread . Little trouble is required in preparing
      them for use ; and this circumstance, joined to
      the want of proper domestic arrangements , favours
       their extensive use amongst a class so [improvident]
      and careless as the operative manufacturers [.]
       Tobacco is very largely consumed by the male

    of short and blackened pipes.* Smoking, too , is
    an almost universal accompaniment to drinking-
    a pernicious habit, as will be shortly seen, pre-
     vailing to a frightful extent in this portion of the
    population .
     The difference exhibited both by the buyers
    and sellers of animal and vegetable food on the
    Saturday, which is the general provision market-
    day and the pay- day ofthe labourers , in the morn-
    ing and evening, very strikingly illustrates the dif-
    ferent grades into which the community of a
    manufacturing town or district is divided.
     Speaking generally, the markets are well sup-
     plied , both as regards quality and quantity.
    Animal food , consisting of beef, mutton, veal , and
    pork , is plentiful , and of the best sorts- certainly
    not surpassed by any market in the kingdom .
    Vegetables are equally abundant and of an equally
    good quality. Lancashire has indeed long been
    famous for the excellence of its potatoes, a native
     rarely meeting with any fit to be compared
    with them for growth and flavour. Cheese , flour,
     butter, &c . & c . , are also in like manner good and
    abundant- in short, there is nothing eatable but
    what may be found at a moderate price and in any
    quantity .
      * The consumption of tobacco has increased from 1814 to
     1832 , from 15,000,000lbs. to 20,000,000 lbs, that is, about
     31 per cent. against an increase in population of 24 per cent.
     It is much less used now than formerly by the upper and
     middle classes.

      The plainness and want of solidity and proper
      stimulus in the food of the labourer , is attended
     by some other evils, bearing strongly upon his
      domestic habits .
       His labour is continued so uninterruptedly[ ,][ that]
     whether it is morning, or noon , or night[,] he leaves
      the mill or work- shop , and devours his watery meal
      with feelings of such mental depression and bodily
      exhaustion that he eagerly swallows a stimulus [in]
      the shape of spirits or beer[,] to supply by[ its] [tem-]

     on the one hand , and of due relaxation on the [other][.]
       This habit ofdram- drinking, so fatal in its conse-
      quences, is of the most extensive prevalence . By
      satisfying the cravings for support, and by rousing
      into activity the mental faculties , the labourers ,
     male as well as female, swallow the pernicious
      draught , and bless it as the boon which relieves them
      from their harassed sensations . They resemble in
      this respect the hypochondriac , who flies madly to a
      stimulant which in his better senses he deprecates
     and avoids as a curse ; but there is this lamentable
      difference- that the labourers have no lucid inter
      vals, no return of correct sensations . Day after

      of the cheering influence of the face of Nature ,

     The increase which has of late years taken
    place in the number of gin-vaults , and the more
    than equal increase in the number of low beer-

    entering a gin shop, in five minutes, during eight successive

     till ten . The average result was 112 men and 163 women,

       It is a strange sight to watch one of these dens
     of wickedness throughout an evening : it is a
     strange, a melancholy, yet, to the meditative man ,
     an interesting sight . There approaches a half-
     clad man, covered with cardings , shivering even
     beneath the summer breeze which is singing
     around him. He comes with faltering step ,
     downcast eye, and air of general exhaustion and
     dejection, He reaches his accustomed gin-vault,
     disappears for half an hour or less , and now
     comes forth a new creature : were it not for his
     filthy dress, he would hardly be recognized- for
     his step is elastic, his eye is brilliant and open,
     his air animated and joyous . He inhales the
     breeze as a refreshing draught, and he deems him-
     self happy . His enjoyment is, however, short-

      lived , and purchased at an immense sacrifice , for
     the
              " -Price is death !
                 It is a costly feast."
     Now comes a woman, perhaps his wife, bear-
     ing a sickly and cadaverous-looking infant, wail-
     ing and moaning as if in pain or wanting nutri-
     ment. She is indeed offering it the breast, but
      it is flaccid and cold as marble . She has no
     endearments for her child , it is held as a burden-
     passively and carelessly . She is thin, pale, and
     badly dressed- is without oonnet, and her cap is
      soiled and ragged ; her bosom is exposed, her
     gown is filthy, her shoes only half on her feet,
     and her whole aspect forlorn and forbidding.
     She too disappears for a time within the gin-shop,
     remains longer than her husband, but returns
     equally changed . The child is now crowing in
     her arms , clapping its tiny hands , and is filled
     with infantine mirth , whilst its mother views it
     with fondness , joins in its vociferations , tosses it
     in her arms and kisses it like a mother . She
     passes on cheerily, her whole gait is altered , her
     cheeks are flushed , and she thinks herself happy-
     for her maternal feelings are aroused , and her
     inebriated child seems to her own disordered
     senses the very paragon of beauty and delight.
      The pair have now reached home- night is far
     advanced , and the fumes of their intoxications are
     worn off or become converted into sullenness .
     The child is in a stupor, and the husband and

    leaving the child lying on a ricketty chair[,] from

     Here come several girls and young women ,
    tolerably dressed ; some with harsh, husky voices,
    shewing the premature development of puberty,
    others full grown and perfectly-formed women.
    All , save one, have the same pallid hue of counte-
    nance, the same coarseness of expression , the
    same contour of figure-but all seem equally toil-
    worn and exhausted . One amongst them is ,
    however, beautiful , and beautiful as an innocent
     girl alone can be--the very purity of her heart
    and her soul gleaming in her face. Her figure is
    plump and round , and her cheeks, though some-
    what pale, are yet firm in their outline . It is
    evident that she is scarcely at home in the pre-
    sence of her companions , nor one of them in
    feeling, though it would seem that she is
    condemned to the same labour . Yes ! it is so .
    She is not many weeks returned from a distant
    town, in which she had been apprenticed to a
    respectable trade . Adverse circumstances have ,
    however, driven her home, and she has no re-
    source but to become a weaver, and this she has
    been for upwards of a week . She hesitates to
    enter the beer shop--she withdraws timidly, but

      long ; and now approach a number of young men
      with soiled dress , open necks , and of obscene
      speech. They, too, enter the beer house, Laugh-
      ter long and loud resounds from it ; time wears
      on , but the drunken revel continues unabated→
     now shewing itself by bursts of obstreperous
      merriment- now by vollies of imprecations- now
     by the rude dance and now by the ribald song.
     But where is that delicate and beautiful girl ? Can
      she be one sharing such scenes ? Can she, whose
      eyes and ears evidently revolted from the bold
      gestures and speeches of her companions , be re-
      maining to share such coarse orgies ? Eleven
      o'clock, and the party re-appear. Cursing , swear.
      ing, hiccuping, indecent displays , mark their exit ;
      and there is the fair girl , whose " unsmirched brow"
      so lately gave token of her purity. But now she
       is metamorphosed into a bacchanal, with distend-
      ed and glowing cheeks, staggering step , disordered
      apparel- lost, utterly lost, to herself ; and when
      the morning bell rings her to her appointed la-
      bour, she will be one of the herd, and will
      speedily lose all trace of her purity and feminine
      beauty.

    apparel, or equally wretched furniture .

      upon them, be it twopence, fourpence , sixpence ,
      eightpence, or one shilling.
       This utter disregard for personal comfort and
      household decency, strongly demonstrates the
      miserably low ebb to which the domestic relations
      are reduced , and proclaims , in a voice which it
       is impossible to misunderstand , how deplorable ,
     how pitiable is the condition , which thus deprives
      itself, like the untutored and uncultivated savage,
      of every thing humanising, for the sake of a mo-
     mentary excitement ; -which leaves matters in an
      infinitely worse state than before , and precipitates
      the unhappy being who thus blindly indulges a
     depraved taste, only the more rapidly upon his
      inevitable ruin . * Truly did Mr. Hunter remark ,
      that of all the products of civilization , the North
    " American savage was anxious alone for brandy
      * Neither has this passion lessened since the day of the acute
      Hunter. At the treaty of Chicago , in 1821 , the commissioners
      ordered that no spirits should be issued to the Indians . A de-
      putation of the chiefs was sent to remonstrate against this pre-
      cautionary measure ; and at its head was Topnibe, chief of the
      Potawatomic tribe, a man upwards of eighty years of age.
      Every argument was used to convince them that the measure
      was indispensable : that they were exposed to daily murders,
      and that while in a state of intoxication, they were unable to
      attend to the business for which they were convened . All this
      was useless, and discussion only terminated by the peremptory
      refusal ofthe commissioners to accede to their request. " Father,"
      said the hoary-headed chief, when he was urged to remain
      sober, and make a good bargain for his people, " Father, we
      care not for money, nor the lands, nor the goods.- We want
      the whiskey. Give us the whiskey."

   and gunpowder ; and with equal truth it may be
    said, that the nearer a people approach to the
    destitution of savage life , the more eagerly do
   they seek to participate the enjoyments of
    intoxication . Distilled spirits afford a cheap and
    effectual oblivion of cares and wants , and how-
   ever much the indulgence may increase the sum of
   human sufferings , it is not surprising that they
   who have no other pleasure within their reach,
   should madly snatch at this solitary comfort.
     Independently of these open and recognised
   means , which are within the the reach of the la-
   bourer and his family, there are others of most ex
    tensive operation for demoralizing him , through
   the agency of drunkenness and its attendant vices .
   The lowest class of the population , in the manu-
    facturing towns , is , to a very considerable extent,
   made up of Irish, who inhabit the cellars and
   those portions of the towns which , to the casual
    observer, would appear totally uninhabitable . In
    these places , however, is congregated a very nu-
   merous body of people, who have introduced
    with them the same spirit of recklessness and im-
    providence , with the same systematic evasion of or
    violent resistance to law and order , which have so
    long disgraced their native country , and gone far
    towards ruining its resources . Here , and by these
    individuals , illicit distillation is carried on to a
    great extent. It has been calculated , upon not
    very perfect data , that there are not less than 100

       stills in constant operation in Manchester alone, *
      producing genuine potheen ofthe highest strength.
      From many seizures which have been made, it
      appears that the average size of the tubs may be
      about thirty gallons, and if each distillery should
      produce no greater quantity than this , the whole
      amount would be very considerable ; and this is
      drunk, be it remembered , almost exclusively by
      the lowest classes . Reckoning thirty gallons as
      the weekly produce, it would give annually
      156,000 gallons , which pays no duty, and the ma-
      nufacture of which is carried on under circum-
      stances in the highest degree unfavourable to the
      welfare of a peaceable population . This estimate
       is, however, most probably underrated-the dif-
       ficulty of detection is extreme-occupying, as the
       distilleries do, sites apparentlythe most improbable,
      and unfitted for the purpose . These generally are
      dark cellars, having no outlet except a trap-door,
      opening into some obscure court, half filled with
       filth , or excavations dug in the sand -stone rock,
      beneath tenements occupied by persons either
      knowing nothing of their subterranean neighbours ,
      or being in league with them. The requisite ap-
      paratus is so simple and so little expensive , that
       * During the year 1832 , thirty persons were committed to
      the New Bailey, Manchester, for having either been detected
       in distilling or hawking illicit spirits. Nearly the whole of
       these were Irish-one half had been known to have carried on
       the trade before, and one-third had been previously convicted
      and suffered imprisonment.

   detection is no hinderance , and a seizure valueless .
   The fine inflicted , £30, is of no moment to the
   successful speculator ; and if it should so happen
   that he is unable to pay it, the short imprisonment
   which is the alternative , only hardens him in
   crime, and turns him out upon society a more
   determined and experienced scoundrel .
    The introduction of a low Irish population into
   Manchester and the surrounding manufacturing
   towns and districts, has unquestionably aided very
   materially the destruction of domestic virtues and
   orderly habits in the operatives . The disregard
   to home comforts, which renders the Irish cabin a
   blot upon the history of its country, is exhibited
    still more strikingly when seen in the midst of a
   large town ; and it has, unfortunately , found ready
    imitators in a class of the community, prepared
    for its adoption, in some degree, by poverty, ig-
   norance, want of morality, and a growing indis-
    position for home, generated by a system of labour
   which, by separating families , and by exhausting
    their physical energies by incessant application ,
   rendered them ready to fly, for temporary relief,
   to the gin-shop, the beer-house or the whiskey
    dealer.

      upon them , be it twopence , fourpence, sixpence ,
      eightpence , or one shilling.
        This utter disregard for personal comfort and
      household decency, strongly demonstrates the
      miserably low ebb to which the domestic relations
      are reduced , and proclaims, in a voice which it
       is impossible to misunderstand , how deplorable ,
      how pitiable is the condition , which thus deprives
       itself, like the untutored and uncultivated savage ,
      of every thing humanising, for the sake of a mo-
                 ――
      mentary excitement ; which leaves matters in an
       infinitely worse state than before , and precipitates
      the unhappy being who thus blindly indulges a
      depraved taste, only the more rapidly upon his
      inevitable ruin . * Truly did Mr. Hunter remark,
      that of all the products of civilization , the North
      " American savage was anxious alone for brandy
       * Neither has this passion lessened since the day of the acute
      Hunter. At the treaty of Chicago, in 1821 , the commissioners
       ordered that no spirits should be issued to the Indians . A de-
       putation of the chiefs was sent to remonstrate against this pre-
       cautionary measure ; and at its head was Topnibe , chief of the
      Potawatomic tribe, a man upwards of eighty years of age.
      Every argument was used to convince them that the measure
      was indispensable : that they were exposed to daily murders,
      and that while in a state of intoxication , they were unable to
       attend to the business for which they were convened . All this
      was useless , and discussion only terminated by the peremptory
       refusal ofthe commissioners to accede to their request. " Father,"
       said the hoary-headed chief, when he was urged to remain
       sober, and make a good bargain for his people, " Father, we
       care not for money, nor the lands, nor the goods.- We want
      the whiskey. Give us the whiskey."

   and gunpowder ; and with equal truth it may be
    said , that the nearer a people approach to the
    destitution of savage life , the more eagerly do
   they seek to participate the enjoyments of
    intoxication . Distilled spirits afford a cheap and
    effectual oblivion of cares and wants, and how-
   ever much the indulgence may increase the sum of
   human sufferings , it is not surprising that they
   who have no other pleasure within their reach ,
    should madly snatch at this solitary comfort.
     Independently of these open and recognised
   means, which are within the the reach of the la-
   bourer and his family, there are others of most ex
    tensive operation for demoralizing him , through
   the agency of drunkenness and its attendant vices .
   The lowest class of the population , in the manu-
    facturing towns , is , to a very considerable extent ,
   made up of Irish , who inhabit the cellars and
   those portions of the towns which, to the casual
    observer, would appear totally uninhabitable . In
    these places , however, is congregated a very nu-
   merous body of people, who have introduced
    with them the same spirit of recklessness and im-
    providence , with the same systematic evasion of or
    violent resistance to law and order , which have so
    long disgraced their native country, and gone far
    towards ruining its resources . Here , and by these
    individuals , illicit distillation is carried on to a
    great extent. It has been calculated , upon not
    very perfect data , that there are not less than 100

       stills in constant operation in Manchester alone, *
      producing genuine potheen of the highest strength .
     From many seizures which have been made, it
      appears that the average size of the tubs may be
      about thirty gallons , and if each distillery should
      produce no greater quantity than this , the whole
      amount would be very considerable ; and this is
      drunk, be it remembered , almost exclusively by
      the lowest classes . Reckoning thirty gallons as
      the weekly produce, it would give annually
      156,000 gallons , which pays no duty, and the ma-
      nufacture of which is carried on under circum-
      stances in the highest degree unfavourable to the
      welfare of a peaceable population . This estimate
       is, however, most probably underrated- the dif
       ficulty of detection is extreme-occupying, as the
       distilleries do , sites apparentlythe most improbable ,
      and unfitted for the purpose . These generally are
      dark cellars, having no outlet except a trap-door,
      opening into some obscure court, half filled with
       filth , or excavations dug in the sand -stone rock ,
      beneath tenements occupied by persons either
      knowing nothing of their subterranean neighbours ,
      or being in league with them. The requisite ap-
      paratus is so simple and so little expensive , that
       * During the year 1832, thirty persons were committed to
       the New Bailey, Manchester, for having either been detected
       in distilling or hawking illicit spirits. Nearly the whole of
       these were Irish-one half had been known to have carried on
       the trade before, and one-third had been previously convicted
      and suffered imprisonment.

    detection is no hinderance , and a seizure valueless .
    The fine inflicted , £30 , is of no moment to the
    successful speculator ; and if it should so happen
    that he is unable to pay it , the short imprisonment
    which is the alternative, only hardens him in
    crime , and turns him out upon society a more
    determined and experienced scoundrel .
     The introduction of a low Irish population into .
    Manchester and the surrounding manufacturing
    towns and districts, has unquestionably aided very
    materially the destruction of domestic virtues and
    orderly habits in the operatives . The disregard
    to home comforts , which renders the Irish cabin a
    blot upon the history of its country , is exhibited
     still more strikingly when seen in the midst of a
    large town ; and it has , unfortunately , found ready
     imitators in a class of the community, prepared
     for its adoption, in some degree, by poverty, ig-
    norance, want of morality, and a growing indis-
     position for home, generated by a system of labour
    which, by separating families, and by exhausting
     their physical energies by incessant application,
    rendered them ready to fly, for temporary relief,
    to the gin-shop, the beer-house or the whiskey
    dealer.

   would amend , or their endeavours will do no
   good, but may, from want of proper direction , do
    infinite harm .
    The inquirer into the progress of the civiliza-
    tion of man , has long ago learnt the following
    series of facts . He finds that as man removes
   from utter barbarism-from a state elevated but
   one remove above the brute creation--he raises
   himself a habitation , more or less comfortable , as
   a shelter against the vicissitudes of the seasons ,
   and as a place of refuge ; that in his primeval
   condition he contented himself with the shelter
   of a tree, and the protection of the natural caves
   or strong-holds around him ; that, at this period ,
   he lives upon aliment chiefly of a vegetable na-
   ture, or picks up a scanty and precarious subsist-
   ence by fishing , or devouring the minuter forms
   of animal life ; that in his first advance in social
   improvement , he erects himself a rude hut of
   wood, or sods, or stone, as his particular locality
   may point out to him , badly built , badly covered -in,
   admitting little light , but freely open to the winds
   of heaven ; that he now becomes a hunter, and
    tills imperfectly a small patch of ground , for the
   production of those esculent roots or seeds which
   experience has taught him are fit for the support
   of life ; that in his next advance he improves his
   hut, forms a communion with his fellows under
   an acknowledged superior , joins his labours ,
   whether of the chace or of cultivation , with those
   of others - shews some tokens of religion , how-

      lived , and purchased at an immense sacrifice , for
      the
              " -Price is death !
                 It is a costly feast."
      Now comes a woman, perhaps his wife, bear-
      ing a sickly and cadaverous-looking infant , wail-
     ing and moaning as if in pain or wanting nutri-
     ment. She is indeed offering it the breast, but
       it is flaccid and cold as marble . She has no
     endearments for her child , it is held as a burden-
      passively and carelessly . She is thin, pale, and
     badly dressed- is without oonnet , and her cap is
      soiled and ragged ; her bosom is exposed , her
     gown is filthy, her shoes only half on her feet,
     and her whole aspect forlorn and forbidding.
     She too disappears for a time within the gin-shop,
     remains longer than her husband , but returns
      equally changed . The child is now crowing in
     her arms, clapping its tiny hands, and is filled
      with infantine mirth , whilst its mother views it
      with fondness, joins in its vociferations, tosses it
      in her arms and kisses it like a mother . She
      passes on cheerily, her whole gait is altered , her
      cheeks are flushed , and she thinks herself happy-
      for her maternal feelings are aroused , and her
      inebriated child seems to her own disordered
      senses the very paragon of beauty and delight.
      The pair have now reached home- night is far
     advanced , and the fumes of their intoxications are
     worn off or become converted into sullenness .
     The child is in a stupor, and the husband and

     wife meet without a single kindly greeting . There
     is no food , no fire : bickerings arise, mutual re-
     crimination, blows, curses -till both at last sink
     into the stupified sleep of drunkenness , worn out
    by toil, excessive stimulus , and evil passions--
     leaving the child lying on a ricketty chair, from
    which it must inevitably fall should it awake.
     Here come several girls and young women,
     tolerably dressed ; some with harsh, husky voices,
    shewing the premature development of puberty,
     others full grown and perfectly- formed women .
     All , save one, have the same pallid hue of counte-
    nance, the same coarseness of expression , the
    same contour of figure-but all seem equally toil-
    worn and exhausted . One amongst them is ,
    however, beautiful, and beautiful as an innocent
     girl alone can be--the very purity of her heart
    and her soul gleaming in her face . Her figure is
    plump and round, and her cheeks , though some-
    what pale, are yet firm in their outline. It is
    evident that she is scarcely at home in the pre-
    sence of her companions , nor one of them in
     feeling , thoughthough it would seem that she is
    condemned to the same labour . Yes ! it is so .
    She is not many weeks returned from a distant
    town, in which she had been apprenticed to a
    respectable trade. Adverse circumstances have,
    however, driven her home , and she has no re-
    source but to become a weaver , and this she has
    been for upwards of a week. She hesitates to
     enter the beer shop--she withdraws timidly, but

      at length is lost within its door , amidst the laugh-
       ter and jeers of her companions. They remain
      long ; and now approach a number of young men
      with soiled dress , open necks , and of obscene
      speech. They, too , enter the beer house, Laugh-
      ter long and loud resounds from it ; time wears
      on , but the drunken revel continues unabated-
     now shewing itself by bursts of obstreperous
      merriment- now by vollies of imprecations- now
     by the rude dance and now by the ribald song.
      But where is that delicate and beautiful girl ? Can
      she be one sharing such scenes ? Can she, whose
      eyes and ears evidently revolted from the bold
      gestures and speeches of her companions , be re-
      maining to share such coarse orgies ? Eleven
      o'clock, and the party re-appear. Cursing , swear-
      ing, hiccuping, indecent displays , mark their exit ;
      and there is the fair girl, whose " unsmirched brow"
      so lately gave token of her purity. But now she
      is metamorphosed into a bacchanal, with distend-
      ed and glowing cheeks , staggering step, disordered
      apparel- lost, utterly lost, to herself ; and when
      the morning bell rings her to her appointed la-
      bour , she will be one of the herd, and will
      speedily lose all trace of her purity and feminine
      beauty.
       If there is one period of the day when these
      displays excite more unmingled disgust than ano-
      ther, it is during the hours of labour, when those
      wives and mothers of the absent artizans , who
      are either unable to work, or cannot procure it,

    are left at home. No domestic cares occupy

        This utter disregard for personal comfort and
       household decency, strongly demonstrates the
       miserably low ebb to which the domestic relations
       are reduced, and proclaims , in a voice which it

      the trade before, and one-third had been previously convicted
      and suffered imprisonment.

    detection is no hinderance , and a seizure valueless .
    The fine inflicted , £30 , is of no moment to the
    successful speculator ; and if it should so happen
    that he is unable to pay it, the short imprisonment
    which is the alternative , only hardens him in
    crime, and turns him out upon society a more
    determined and experienced scoundrel .

    lived, and purchased at an immense sacrifice , for
    the
             " -Price is death !
                It is a costly feast."
    Now comes a woman, perhaps his wife, bear-
    ing a sickly and cadaverous-looking infant, wail-
    ing and moaning as if in pain or wanting nutri-
    ment . She is indeed offering it the breast, but
     it is flaccid and cold as marble . She has no
    endearments for her child , it is held as a burden-
    passively and carelessly . She is thin, pale, and
    badly dressed- is without oonnet , and her cap is
     soiled and ragged ; her bosom is exposed , her
    gown is filthy, her shoes only half on her剿 feet,
    and her whole aspect forlorn and forbidding .
    She too disappears for a time within the gin-shop ,
    remains longer than her husband , but returns
    equally changed . The child is now crowing in
    her arms , clapping its tiny hands , and is filled
    with infantine mirth, -whilst its mother views it
    with fondness, joins in its vociferations , tosses it
    in her arms and kisses it like a mother. She
    passes on cheerily, her whole gait is altered , her
    cheeks are flushed , and she thinks herself happy-
     for her maternal feelings are aroused , and her
     inebriated child seems to her own disordered
     senses the very paragon of beauty and delight.
     The pair have now reached home- night is far
    advanced , and the fumes of their intoxications are
    worn off or become converted into sullenness .
    The child is in a stupor, and the husband and

    wife meet without a single kindly greeting . There
     is no food, no fire : bickerings arise , mutual re-
    crimination , blows, curses -till both at last sink
    into the stupified sleep of drunkenness , worn out
    by toil, excessive stimulus , and evil passions--
    leaving the child lying on a ricketty chair, from
    which it must inevitably fall should it awake .
     Here come several girls and young women ,
    tolerably dressed ; some with harsh, husky voices ,
    shewing the premature development of puberty,
    others full grown and perfectly-formed women .
     All , save one , have the same pallid hue of counte-
    nance, the same coarseness of expression , the
    same contour of figure-but all seem equally toil-
    worn and exhausted . One amongst them is,
    however, beautiful, and beautiful as an innocent
     girl alone can be--the very purity of her heart
    and her soul gleaming in her face. Her figure is
    plump and round , and her cheeks , though some-
    what pale, are yet firm in their outline . It is
    evident that she is scarcely at home in the pre-
    sence of her companions, nor one of them in
    feeling, though it would seem that she is
    condemned to the same labour. Yes ! it is so.
    She is not many weeks returned from a distant
    town, in which she had been apprenticed to a
    respectable trade. Adverse circumstances have ,
    however, driven her home, and she has no re-
    source but to become a weaver, and this she has
    been for upwards of a week . She hesitates to
    enter the beer shop --she withdraws timidly, but

      at length is lost within its door, amidst the laugh-
      ter and jeers of her companions. They remain
      long ; and now approach a number of young men
      with soiled dress , open necks , and of obscene
      speech. They, too , enter the beer house, Laugh-
      ter long and loud resounds from it ; time wears
      on , but the drunken revel continues unabated-
     now shewing itself by bursts of obstreperous
      merriment- now by vollies of imprecations-now
     by the rude dance--and now by the ribald song.
     But where is that delicate and beautiful girl ? Can
      she be one sharing such scenes ? Can she, whose
      eyes and ears evidently revolted from the bold
      gestures and speeches of her companions, be re-
      maining to share such coarse orgies ? Eleven
      o'clock, and the party re-appear. Cursing, swear-
      ing, hiccuping, indecent displays , mark their exit ;
      and there is the fair girl , whose " unsmirched brow"
      so lately gave token of her purity . But now she
      is metamorphosed into a bacchanal, with distend-
      ed and glowing cheeks, staggering step , disordered
      apparel- lost, utterly lost, to herself ; and when
      the morning bell rings her to her appointed la-
     bour, she will be one of the herd, and will
      speedily lose all trace of her purity and feminine
      beauty.
       If there is one period of the day when these
      displays excite more unmingled disgust than ano-
      ther, it is during the hours of labour, when those
      wives and mothers of the absent artizans , who
      are either unable to work, or cannot procure it,

     are left at home. No domestic cares occupy
    them, except in a few rare cases . Their hearths
     are unswept, their persons and houses uncleaned ,
     their rooms untidied . On the contrary, they
     are seen in groups of two or three, lounging about
    the gin or beer shops, wasting any trifle of money
    they may have reserved , or procuring a supply
    by pawning some portion of their wretched ap-
     apparel, or equally wretched furniture .
      Pawnbrokers ' shops have an affinity in their
     demoralizing agency to the gin and beer houses ,
    and are almost as numerous , occupying the same
     localities , and giving unhappy facilities to the
    poor man to protract his Saturday night's, or
     Sunday's debauch throughout the early part
     of the week . Article after article is pledged
     for small sums , to be redeemed the next pay-
    day, and homesteads which, on the Saturday
    mornings, are destitute of every domestic utensil ,
     are found, in the evening, possessing some ofthese .
    They have been fetched from pledge , a loss has
    been sustained upon them, and in ninety - nine
     cases out of one hundred they are again missing
     before the middle of the ensuing week. The same
    with regard to dress-coat or trowsers , cloak,
     dress , or under dress , shoes , stockings , &c . & c . ,
     all have a constant round . Sacrifice after sacrifice
     takes place, till at length the articles are either left
    unredeemed , or are become so far worn and tattered
     as to be no longer a valid security to the pawn-
     broker, even for the very small sum he advances

     upon them, be it twopence , fourpence, sixpence,
      eightpence , or one shilling.
       This utter disregard for personal comfort and
      household decency, strongly demonstrates the
      miserably low ebb to which the domestic relations
      are reduced, and proclaims , in a voice which it
      is impossible to misunderstand , how deplorable ,
     how pitiable is the condition , which thus deprives
      itself, like the untutored and uncultivated savage ,
     of every thing humanising, for the sake of a mo-
     mentary excitement ; -which leaves matters in an
      infinitely worse state than before , and precipitates
     the unhappy being who thus blindly indulges a
     depraved taste, only the more rapidly upon his
      inevitable ruin . * Truly did Mr. Hunter remark,
     that of all the products of civilization , the North
     American savage was anxious alone for brandy
      * Neither has this passion lessened since the day of the acute
      Hunter. At the treaty of Chicago, in 1821 , the commissioners
      ordered that no spirits should be issued to the Indians . A de-
      putation of the chiefs was sent to remonstrate against this pre-
      cautionary measure ; and at its head was Topnibe, chief of the
      Potawatomic tribe, a man upwards of eighty years of age.
     Every argument was used to convince them that the measure
     was indispensable : that they were exposed to daily murders,
     and that while in a state of intoxication, they were unable to
      attend to the business for which they were convened. All this
     was useless, and discussion only terminated by the peremptory
      refusal of the commissioners to accede to their request . " Father,"
      said the hoary-headed chief, when he was urged to remain
      sober, and make a good bargain for his people, " Father, we
      care not for money , nor the lands, nor the goods.- We want
     the whiskey. Give us the whiskey."

   and gunpowder ; and with equal truth it may be
    said, that the nearer a people approach to the
    destitution of savage life , the more eagerly do
   they seek to participate the enjoyments of
    intoxication. Distilled spirits afford a cheap and
    effectual oblivion of cares and wants , and how-
    ever much the indulgence may increase the sum of
   human sufferings , it is not surprising that they
   who have no other pleasure within their reach ,
    should madly snatch at this solitary comfort.
     Independently of these open and recognised
   means, which are within the the reach of the la-
   bourer and his family, there are others of most ex
    tensive operation for demoralizing him, through
   the agency of drunkenness and its attendant vices .
   The lowest class of the population , in the manu-
    facturing towns , is , to a very considerable extent ,
   made up of Irish , who inhabit the cellars and
   those portions of the towns which , to the casual
   observer, would appear totally uninhabitable . In
    these places, however, is congregated a very nu-
   merous body of people, who have introduced
   with them the same spirit of recklessness and im-
    providence , with the same systematic evasion of or
    violent resistance to law and order , which have so
   long disgraced their native country, and gone far
   towards ruining its resources . Here , and by these
    individuals , illicit distillation is carried on to a
    great extent. It has been calculated , upon not
    very perfect data , that there are not less than 100

      stills in constant operation in Manchester alone , *
     producing genuine potheen ofthe highest strength .
     From many seizures which have been made, it
     appears that the average size of the tubs may be
     about thirty gallons , and if each distillery should
     produce no greater quantity than this , the whole
     amount would be very considerable ; and this is
     drunk, be it remembered , almost exclusively by
     the lowest classes . Reckoning thirty gallons as
     the weekly produce, it would give annually
     156,000 gallons, which pays no duty, and the ma-
     nufacture of which is carried on under circum-
     stances in the highest degree unfavourable to the
     welfare of a peaceable population . This estimate
      is, however, most probably underrated-the dif-
      ficulty of detection is extreme-occupying, as the
      distilleries do , sites apparently the most improbable ,
     and unfitted for the purpose . These generally are
     dark cellars , having no outlet except a trap-door,
     opening into some obscure court, half filled with
      filth , or excavations dug in the sand - stone rock,
     beneath tenements occupied by persons either
     knowing nothing of their subterranean neighbours ,
     or being in league with them. The requisite ap-
     paratus is so simple and so little expensive, that
       * During the year 1832, thirty persons were committed to
      the New Bailey, Manchester, for having either been detected
      in distilling or hawking illicit spirits. Nearly the whole of
      these were Irish-one half had been known to have carried on
      the trade before, and one-third had been previously convicted
      and suffered imprisonment.

    detection is no hinderance , and a seizure valueless .
    The fine inflicted , £30 , is of no moment to the
     successful speculator ; and if it should so happen
     that he is unable to pay it, the short imprisonment
    which is the alternative , only hardens him in
    crime , and turns him out upon society a more
    determined and experienced scoundrel .
     The introduction of a low Irish population[ into]
    Manchester and the surrounding manufacturing
    towns and districts , has unquestionably aided very
     materially the destruction of domestic virtues [and]
     orderly habits in the operatives [.] The disregard
     to home comforts , which renders the Irish cabin [a]
     blot upon the history of its country[,] is exhibited
      still more strikingly when seen in the midst of [a]
     large town ; and it has, unfortunately [,] found ready
     imitators in a class of the community, prepared
     for its adoption, in some degree, by poverty[,] ig-
     norance, want of morality, and a growing [indis-]
     position for home , generated by a system of [labour]
    which, by separating families , and by exhausting
     their physical energies by incessant application[ ,]
     rendered them ready to fly, for temporary [relief][,]
     to the gin-shop, the beer-house or the whiskey
     dealer.

   would amend , or their endeavours will do no
   good, but may, from want of proper direction , do
    infinite harm.
    The inquirer into the progress of the civiliza-
    tion of man , has long ago learnt the following
    series of facts . He finds that as man removes
   from utter barbarism-from a state elevated but
   one remove above the brute creation --he raises
    himself a habitation , more or less comfortable , as
    a shelter against the vicissitudes of the seasons ,
   and as a place of refuge ; that in his primeval

    separate conditions are essential to the perfection
    of the whole system .
     If the progress of civilization is thus clearly •
    marked by these various gradations from the sim-
    ple animal existence of man in his primeval state ,
    his lapse may be truly said to be indicated by
    data of a similar character. Taking the extent
    of refinement and the perfection of social com-
    munion as they are displayed by the middle class
    of society - neither placing it too high nor too
    low-the degree to which the lowest classes in
    the manufacturing towns and districts have retro-
    graded , or remained behind in the march of im- .
    provement , is very apparent . Judging them by
    the same rules which have been applied to mark
    the advancement of man from a savage state
    they have made but few steps forward ; and
    though their primitive nature is disguised and

     modified by the force of external circumstances,
     they differ but little in inherent qualities from the
     uncultivated child of nature , and shew their dis-
     tinction rather in the mode than the reality of
     their barbarous and debased condition .
     When it is borne in mind that the class which is
     so little elevated in its social instincts and domes-
      tic habits and intelligence , lives in the nineteenth
     century, in a country which has been long freed
     from hostile aggression , in the midst of a nation
     pre-eminent for its cultivation of the arts and
     sciences-celebrated for its benevolence , and its
     unceasing efforts to extend the blessings of religion
     and moral instruction over the whole habitable
     globe--famed for the general extent of its educa-
     tion- its enjoyments of political rights- its chari-
     table institutions- the numbers of its clergy— the
     wealth and splendour of its church- its degraded
     condition becomes the more remarkable . Did
     this unhappy depression in the social rank include
     the population only of some secluded and out of
     the way nook of the empire ; did it only embrace
     a few scattered tribes , remote from the centre of
      its power ; did it only extend over a limited num-
     ber of individuals which, compared to the great
     mass , were but as a mote in the sun-beam, it
     might excite but little surprise . But, no- it is
                It includes several millions in
     just the reverse.

     of the nation-important and indispensable agents

     stone of a great portion of its pre-eminence-

    having the full benefit of all those institutions so
    lauded and pointed out as land-marks , shewing
   how far it has advanced in the march of civilization .
    The houses of great numbers of the labouring
   community in the manufacturing districts pre-
    sent many of the traces of savage life . Filthy,
   unfurnished , deprived of all the accessories to
   decency or comfort, they are indeed but too truly
   an index of the vicious and depraved lives of their
   inmates . What little furniture is found in them
    is of the rudest and most common sort, and very
   often in fragments-one or two rush-bottomed
    chairs, a deal table , a few stools , broken earthen-
   ware , such as dishes, tea-cups , &c . &c . , one or
   more tin kettles and cans, a few knives and forks ,
   a piece of broken iron , serving as a poker, no fen-
   der, a bedstead or not, as the case may happen to
   be, blankets and sheets in the strict meaning of
   the words unknown -their place often being made
   up of sacking, a heap of flocks, or a bundle of
   straw, supplying the want of a proper bedstead
   and feather bed , and all these cooped in a single
   room , which serves as a place for domestic and
   household occupations.
     In those divisions of the manufacturing towns
   occupied by the lower classes of inhabitants ,
   whether engaged in mill -labour alone , or in mill-
   labour conjointly with hand -loom weaving, the
   houses are of the most flimsy and imperfect struc-
   ture . Tenanted by the week by an improvident
   and changeable set of beings , the owners seldom
   lay out any money upon them, and seem indeed 1

      the ills which are suffered by the poor. The replies to the
      questions contained in the inspector's table, refer only to cases
      of the most positive kind, and the numerical results would there-
      fore have been exceedingly increased, had they embraced those
      in which the evils existed in an inferior degree. Some idea of
      the want of cleanliness prevalent in their habitations, may be
      obtained from the report in the number of houses requiring
      whitewashing ; but this column fails to indicate their gross
      neglect of order and absolute filth . Much less can we obtain
      satisfactory statistical results concerning the want of furniture,
      especially of bedding, and of food, clothing, and fuel.- Dr

     these houses are either totally undrained , or only
    very partially soughed . The whole of the wash-
    ings and filth from these consequently are thrown
     into the front or back street, which being often
    unpaved and cut up into deep ruts , allows them
     to collect into stinking and stagnant pools, while
     fifty, or more even than that number, having only
    a single convenience common to them all , it is in
    a very short time completely choked up with ex-
     crementitious matter. No alternative is left to
     the inhabitants but adding this to the already
     defiled street, and thus leading to a violation of
     all those decencies which shed a protection over
     family morals. *

       It very frequently happens that one tenement is
     held by several families , one room, or at most two,
     being generally looked upon as affording sufficient
     convenience for all the household purposes of
     four or five individuals. The demoralizing effects
     of this utter absence of social and domestic pri-
     vacy must be seen before they can be thoroughly
     understoood , or their extent appreciated . By
      laying bare all the wants and actions of the sexes ,
       it strips them of outward regard for decency-
     modesty is annihilated -the father and the mother ,
     the brother and the sister, the male and female
     lodger, do not scruple to commit acts in the pre-
      " An accurate inspection of this table, will render the extent
      of the evil affecting the poor more apparent. Those districts
      which are almost exclusively inhabited by the labouring popu-
      lation, are, Nos . 1 , 2, 3, 4, and 10 ; Nos. 13, 14, and 7, also
      contain, besides the dwellings ofthe operatives, those of shop-
      keepers and tradesmen, and are traversed by many of the
      principal thoroughfares . No. 11 , was not inspected ; and Nos. 5,
     6, 8, and 9, are the central districts containing the chief streets,
      the most respectable shops, the dwellings of the more wealthy
      inhabitants, and the warehouses of the merchants and manu-
      facturers. Substracting, therefore, from the various totals,
      those items in the reports which concern these divisions only, we
      discover in those districts which contain a large portion of poor,
      viz. 1 , 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13,14, that among 579 streets inspected, 243
      were unpaved, 46 partly paved, 93 ill- ventilated , and 307 con-
      tained heaps of refuse, deep ruts, stagnant pools, ordure, &c.;

       It may be questioned , whether in any other
     quarter of the world , or in any other condition of
     society, such an absence of the observances of
     modesty and personal cleanliness can be found .
     Nothing can be more brutalizing- nothing can
     render individuals more debased in their feelings
     and habits- nothing can tend more powerfully to
     produce that personal coarseness of habits , and
      filthy indelicacy, which are so disgusting and re-
     pulsive in woman .
      Many of these ranges of houses are built back
     to back, fronting one way into a narrow court ,
     across which the inmates of the opposite houses
     may shake hands without stepping out of their
     own doors ; and the other way, into a back street,
     unpaved and unsewered . Most of these houses
     have cellars beneath them, occupied-if it is possi-
     ble to find a lower class - by a still lower class than
     those living above them . From some recent inqui-
      ries on the subject , it would appear, that upwards
     of 20,000 individuals live in cellars in Manchester
     alone . These are generally Irish families- hand-
     loom weavers , bricklayers' labourers , &c . & c . ,
     whose children are beggars or match- sellers in
     conjunction with their mothers . The crowds of
     beings that emerge from these dwellings every
     morning, are truly astonishing , and present very
      little variety as to respectability of appearance :
      all are ragged , all are filthy, all are squalid .
     They separate to pursue their various callings ,
      either shutting up their dens till night, or leaving

    a child as sole occupant. A great portion of these
    wander about the town and its suburbs, begging
    or stealing, as the case may be ; others hawk little
    matters , such as pins , matches , oranges , & c. ,
    bringing back with them any fragment of meat or
    bread they have been able to procure . These
     cells are the very picture of loathsomeness-
    placed upon the soil, though partly flagged , with-
    out drains , subjected to being occasionally over-
    flowed , seldom cleaned every return of their in-
    mates bringing with it a farther accession of filth-
    they speedily become disgusting receptacles of
    every species of vermin which can infest the
    human body.
     The domestic habits of these improvident crea-
     tures are vile in the extreme-carrying their want
    of household decency , if possible , one step further
    than those which have just been described . The
     Irish cottier has brought with him his disgusting
    domestic companion the pig ; for whenever he can
    scrape together a sufficient sum for the purchase
    of one of these animals , it becomes an inmate of
     his cellar . *
     * " In all respects the habitations of the Irish are most des-
     titute. A whole family is often accommodated on a single bed ,
     and sometimes a heap of filthy straw, and a covering of old
     sacking hides them in one undistinguished heap, debased alike
     by penury, want ofeconomy, and dissolute habits . Frequently
     the inspectors found two more families crowded into one small
     house, containing only two apartments, one in which they
      slept, and another in which they ate ; and often more than one
     family lived in a damp cellar, containing only one room, in

        It is here too that he displays his recklessness
      in another of his characteristic propensities—
     whiskey-drinking, an opportunity for the indul-
      gence of which is furnished by the illicit dis-
       tillers in his vicinity for a mere trifle . The dis-
      graceful riots which are calling perpetually for
      the interference of the police, are mainly attri-
      butable to this cause , and a return from the
      lock-ups would abundantly show how terrible are
      the outrages inflicted upon each other during
      these drunken brawls. Often, indeed , the whole
      population of court , street , or entire district , forms
      a faction, in opposition to that of some other in
      the neighbourhood ; and the cries of " O'Flanagan"
      and " M'Carthy," are as rife as in the heart of
      Connaught. When their passions are roused by
      intoxication , most severe and often bloody con-
       flicts ensue between them, to the disturbance and
      degradation of the more peaceable inhabitants .
     Thus it appears that the inferior order of Irishmen
     have brought with them all their vices into the
      manufacturing districts , and aid powerfully by
      their example - independently of lowering the
      value of the labour of the English operative- the
      demoralization which marks his general character.
       Another fertile source of the licentiousness in
      whose pestilential atmosphere from twelve to sixteen persons
      were crowded . To these fertile sources of disease were some-
      times added the keeping of pigs and other animals in the house,
      with other nuisances of the most revolting character."- Dr .
      Kay's pamphlet, p. 32.

   domestic manners, exists in the number of lodg-
   ing-houses, which are very abundant in all the
   manufacturing districts. In towns they are thickly
   scattered through those divisions occupied by the
   poor. By a survey made in Manchester in 1832 ,
   there were found very near 300 of these houses .
   When it is remembered that these are but the
   temporary asylums of want and depravity, their
   number, great as it is , affords no criterion for as-
    certaining how many persons become their in-
   mates during the year. In another point of view,
   they are extremely injurious : the breaking up of
    families, the consequence of mill labour , drives
   many [of][ those][ who][ should][ be][ sheltered][ under][ a]
   very different roof, to take up their abode in these
    haunts of crime ; where , if not already debased by
    other causes , they are speedily reduced to the very
    lowest ebb of moral depravity . Their influence
    in this respect, resembles very closely that
    brought about by a residence in prison ; for the
    parties which are the habitual occupants of the
    one , are in their turn found living in the other.
    The extraordinary sights presented by these
    lodging-houses during the night , are deplorable in
    the extreme , and must fill the heart of any man ,
   open to the feelings of humanity, with pain and
    unutterable disgust . Five , six , seven beds-ac-
    cording to the capacity of the rooms -are ar-
    ranged on the floor-there being in the generality
    of cases , no bedsteads, or any substitutes for
   them ; these are covered with clothing ofthe most

     scanty and filthy description . They are occupied
     indiscriminately by persons of both sexes, stran-
     gers perhaps to each other, except a few of the
     regular occupants . Young men and young wo-
     men ; men, wives, and their children— all lying in
     a noisome atmosphere , swarming with vermin ,
     and often intoxicated . But a veil must be drawn
     over the atrocities which are committed : suffice
      it to say, that villany, debauchery and licentious-
     ness , are here portrayed in their darkest character.
     They serve as so many foci for crime-so many
     hot-beds for bringing into existence vices which
     might have lain dormant , if not roused into vitality
     by their unnatural stimulus .
      The small sum devoted to household purposes
     by the operative , may be determined with some
     accuracy, and it affords considerable information
     as to his habits. A family consisting of five per-
     sons may serve as an example , that being about
     the average number. This family will pay for
     rent, which includes taxes , 3s . a week for a cot-
     tage containing two rooms ; and the different items
     of their expenditure will be somewhere as follows :
     tea, quarter of a pound, 1s. 2d.; coffee, half a
     pound , 10d.; bread , 3s.; coals and candles, 1s.;
     animal food , 2s .; butter, soap, salt and cheese,
     2s. 6d. ; potatoes , 1s . ; sugar , 1s . 6d. ; milk , 3d. ; —
      total , 16s . 3d. The allowance of the above arti-
      cles is liberal , and certainly more than what the
     generality of families use. Against this must be
     placed the amount of their earnings , which when

```
   taken at the average rate of wages paid to manu-
   facturing labourers , will be 10s . 6d. per head—
    total of wages, 27. 12s . 6d. ; thus leaving a surplus
   of 11. 16s . 3d. for dress and other purposes .
    Though the general appearance of the opera-
    tive is squalid , and the majority of the middle
   aged badly dressed, the young women and girls
   expend considerable sums upon their persons.
   They exhibit in the style of dress a very striking
   contrast with the inhabitants of the rural dis-
    tricts, a distinction always observable between
   town and country girls . A taste for shewy
   clothing has been no doubt given by the extreme
   cheapness of printed calicoes and muslins, and
   indeed by the lowness of price in all manufactured
    articles of middling quality ; and the factory girl,
   with her pale face and languid expression , offers ,
   when decked out in her Sunday and holiday ap-
    parel, a strange anomaly with the dirty unfur-
   nished, and miserable home from which she issues.
    The females employed in silk mills go a step
    still further as to dress than the cotton spinner or
   weaver. Many of these are really well and
   handsomely clad , and present an appearance of
   outward respectability, equal if not superior to
    that of hundreds in the middle walks of life.
    A laxity in morals is , however, by no means
    incompatible with personal tidiness and neatness .
    This fact is sufficiently proved by the conduct
   and gestures of many of these girls. A disposi-
    tion for display and a looseness of deportment

      ness- leaves it to the care of a hireling, or young
      person, a mere infant- suffers it to be filthy and
      half- starved ; and, as its faculties develop , takes
     no interest in keeping it from the contagion of
      vice and [grossness] .
     A system which thus depraves and perverts, or
     which demands those times and occasions a
     mother should devote to her infant-which, from
      various concurring causes, so far influences her
     domestic habits as to interfere with the develop-
     ment of her social affections, and which, from its
     continued action upon her, at length destroys or
      buries them beneath a load of grossness and sen-
      suality must be wrong.

    springing as it does from the very groundwork of
    her moral nature , no wonder can be excited that
    the relations of husband and wife are perverted ;
    and , in place of presenting a picture of what love
   and domestic felicity should be, developing a
    scene of indency - wanting everything which
    should render home a place for pure and chaste
    pleasures . The chastity of marriage is but little
   known or exercised ; husband and wife sin
    equally, and an habitual indifference to sexual
    rights is generated , which adds one other item to
    assist in the destruction of domestic habits.
    The delicacy of comportment, which is the
    palladium of married love , has no existence :
    separated during the whole of the day, exposed
    to vicious example , surrounded by a stimulant
    yet enervating atmosphere, the intercourse of man
    and wife loses its protecting influence upon the
    animal appetites, and ceases to become a bar to
    licentiousness and sexual profligacy. After their
    day's labour, they meet at night, not as those who
    love and have been separated ; not to indulge in
    the endearments proper to their condition , but to
    drink and to quarrel ; to behave indecently , or to
    taunt each other in terms of beastiality. The
    fountains of domestic purity being thus poisoned,
    the sanctity of marriage rites thus profaned social
    virtue is driven from her last strong hold, and
    leaves them a prey to obscenity, coarseness , sel-
    fishness , and everything that is pernicious and
    abominable.

      No amenity of manners, no gentleness of be
      haviour, mark the home of a factory labourer in
     a crowded population ; no regard for conjugal
      obligations, no bashful reserve , no cultivation of
      those finer sensibilities , which can and do shed a
      bright gleam of pure radiance over married life ,
     when composed of its proper elements .
       If the domestic manners of the parents are thus
      depraved , their example cannot tend to remove
      the influence of the evil lessons taught their
      children at the mill -the gin or beer-shop- in the
      streets, or lodging-houses . Brother and sister lose
      that connexion which ought naturally and properly
      to exist between them : disregard for each other's
      welfare , a separation of interests and feelings[ ,] a
      forgetfulness of what is due, one to another- de-
      stroy those bonds which should link together the
      hearts of individuals springing from the same
      source, endeared as they ought to be by the
     memory of their younger years- years which [,] un-
      fortunately for them, have been passed in total dis-
      regard for home duties , uncared for likewise by their
      natural guardians , and separated at an early age,
      to be exposed to a continuance of the same vices
      which deprived their homes of all beneficial [in-]
      fluence upon their moral and social development[,]
      and inured to conduct vicious in itself and tending
      to destroy all the nobler and better feelings of
      their nature.
       Neither is the conduct of parent to child, and
      of child to parent, a whit more engaging [;] but [is]

    as remote as possible from the just observance of
    filial and parental duties. Insubordination on
    the part of the child, cruelty and oppression on
    that of the parent ; quarreling , fighting—a total
    alienation of affection ; and , finally, a separation
   from home, at an age when parental control and
    proper domestic discipline are essential to the
    future wellbeing of the child.
    The instances of proper feelings between pa-
    rents and children are very uncommon : those
    offices which should be mutually rendered are
    neglected ; an utter disregard for the well or evil-
   doing of either party is exhibited . If they still
    live together, held by mutual interests, the morals
    of his children form no part of the anxiety of the
    parent, so long as they bring their usual weekly
    allowance to the fund for their support . It is no
   unusual thing to hear a mother detail a course of
   wickedness and licentiousness on the part ofher son ,
    bewailing his neglected time and his lost money,
   without once adverting to the moral criminality
    of his career , or the evil of its example upon the
    rest of her family ; or a father telling the tale of
    his daughter's dishonour, and cursing her for the
    neglect of her work, without even hinting at her
    depravity, or expressing sorrow for her moral
    declension. The brother will relate his sister's
   wanderings from the path of chastity without
   a blush ; and the sister detail her brother's
   promiscuous intercourse amongst her own com-

     A household thus constituted, in which all the
      decencies and moral observances of domestic life
      are constantly violated , reduces its inmates to a
      condition in nowise elevated above that of the
      savage . Recklessness , improvidence, unneces-
      sary poverty, starvation, drunkenness, prostitu-

      of maternal love , destruction of brotherly and

    " WITH civilization and barbarism[,] food and
    clothing appear intimately connected [.] We should
    before-hand be induced to imagine that the most
    excellent development of every [animated][ species]
    would be effected , where all its wants were sup-
    plied , its powers all duly called forth [,] and[ all][ in-]
    jurious and unpleasant circumstances least [pre-]
    valent, and vice versa. But experience teaches us
    that no change can by any means be brought
    about in an individual and transmitted to his[ off-]
    spring. The causes of change in a species must
    therefore operate , not by altering the parents , but

```

```
    by disposing them to produce an offspring more
     or less different from themselves .' Such is Mr.
     Hunter's view of the question , and it is certainly
     confirmed by every fact . Uncivilized nations, ex-
    posed to the inclemency of the weather, sup-
     ported by precarious and frequently unwhole-
    some food , and having none of the distinguishing
     energies of their nature called forth, are almost
     invariably dark-coloured and ugly, while those
    who enjoy the blessings of civilization , that is ,
    good food and covering, with mental cultivation
    and enjoyment, acquire in the same proportion
     the Caucasian characteristics . "
     " The different effects of the different degrees
     of civilization,' says Dr. Smith, · are most con-
     spicuous in those countries in which the laws have
    made the most complete and permanent divisions of
     rank. An immense difference exists between the
     nobility and peasantry of France, Spain , Italy,
    and Germany . It is still more conspicuous in
     eastern countries, where a wide difference exists
    between the highest and lowest ranks of society.
    The naires or nobles of Calicut, in the East Indies ,
    have, with the usual ignorance and precipitancy
     of travellers, been pronounced a different race
    from the populace, because the former, elevated
    by their rank, and devoted only to martial studies
    and achievements , are distinguished by that manly
    beauty and elevated stature, so frequently found
     with the profession of arms , especially when united
     with nobility of descent : the latter, poor and labo-

```
    rious, and exposed to hardships , without the spirit
    or the hope to better their condition , are much
    more deformed and diminutive in their persons,
    and in their complexion much more black .' In
    France,' says Buffon , you may distinguish by
    their aspect, not only the nobility from the pea-
    santry, but the superior orders ofthe nobility from
    the inferior, these from citizens , and those from
    the peasants." The field slaves in America, ' says
    Dr. Smith, are badly clothed , fed , and lodged,
    and live in small tents on the plantations, remote
    from the example and society of their superiors .
    Living by themselves , they retain many of the
    customs and manners of their ancestors . The do-
     mestic servants , on the other hand , who are kept
    near the person, or employed in the family of their
    masters, are treated with great lenity : their work
     is light, they are fed and clothed like their su-
     periors , they see their manners , adopt their
     habits , and insensibly receive the same ideas of
     elegance and beauty. The field slave is in conse-
    quence slow in changing the aspect and figure of
     Africa. The domestic servants have advanced far
     before him in acquiring the agreeable and regular
     features of civilized society . The former are fre-
     quently ill-shaped- they preserve in a great de-
     gree the African lip, and nose , and hair-their
     genius is dull , and their countenance sleepy and
     stupid : the latter are straight and well proportion-
    ed , their hair extended to three, four, and some-
     sertions be doubted , when it is remembered that

     of their mouth handsome, their features regular,
     their capacity good, and their looks animated .' "
     " The South Sea islanders , who appear to be
      all of one family, vary according to the degree [of]
     their cultivation . The people of Otaheite and the
     Society Islands are the most civilized and [the][ most]
     beautiful . The same superiority,' says Captain
     King, which is observable in the Eeces or nobles
     throughout the other islands , is found also here [.]
     Those whom we saw were without exception [well-]
     formed, whereas the lower sort, besides their [ge-]
     neral inferiority, are subject to all the [variety] [of]
     make and figure that is seen in the populace [of]
     other countries. *" "
      Food and clothing then are intimately con-
     nected with civilization , and civilization is inti
     mately connected with personal appearance .
    The half- starved and ill-clothed negro, snatched
     from maritime provinces, utterly barbarous in
     his habits , and exchanging only one sort of
     slavery for another, has long since stamped the
     notion of ugliness upon all the coloured races
     of men. Bruce , Denham, Clapperton , Lander,
     and other travellers into the interior of Africa , give
     assurances that there are numerous tribes , and por-
     tions of tribes, possessing in an eminent degree
     bodily excellence , and exhibiting in their persons
     but few traces of the negro lip or nose, his monkey
     calf or pointed shin-bone . Neither can these as-

    they are described as having made some progress
    in the arts of life, and are distinguished into classes
    or castes . The Dahoman and Ashantee Caboceers ,
    according to Bowditch and Norris , are in many
    points widely dissimilar from the inferior natives ,
      their personal appearance improving as they re-
    cede from the houseless and precarious condition
    of the rude African tribes .
     The pastoral Caffres of Southern Africa, Mr.
    Barrow describes as a remarkably well- built and
    handsome race of men ; they have made some
    advances in civilization , and present as perfect a
    picture of patriarchial existence as can well be
                  素
    imagined . * In all these respects they offer a
    striking contrast to the Bosjesman or Bushmen ,
    who appear at some not very remote period to
    have derived their origin from the same source ,
    The combined evidence of Barrow, Lichstenstein ,
    Vaillant, Campbell , and Burchell , prove that the
    Bushmen are as ugly a race as any under the
    sun ; leading a wandering life ; frequently half-
    times even to six or eight inches , the size and shape
     " From the fertility of their soil , the abundance of their
     rivulets, and the pleasant situation of their craals , may probably
     arise that settled and contented turn of mind which in time of
     peace so remarkably distinguishes the Caffre. To him a neat
      little dwelling, solidly constructed in the centre of a corn-field ,
     that was once cultivated by his ancestors, is sufficient to claim
     the agreeable appellation of his country. The Caffres must
     certainly be acknowledged a more civilized people— their in-
     dustry is more perceptible, and their acquaintance with some
     of the necessary arts of life greatly superior ."- Le Vaillant.

      starved ; then indulging ravenously, and to a
     most enormous extent, in eating-rivalling even
      the Esquimaux as to quantity ; almost naked ;
     hunted by the colonists and their dependents ;
      their bodily form is but an index of their bar-
      barism . There is, however, no reason to doubt
      but that if their wandering and predatory habits
      should in course of time yield to a more settled
     mode of life , it would be followed by a great
     improvement in their physical conformation .
      Thus, then, it seems evident that barbarous
      habits, occasional want of food, bad clothing,
     one and all, produce bodily inferiority . The re-
      cords of all nations prove this , -where an absolute
      division into castes is in force ; by nations still
     termed savage , yet having amongst them a superior
     and inferior order, whether of governors , priests ,
      or warriors ; by slaves imported , -presenting no
     apparent social or bodily disparity, yet, in a few
      years, or in one or two generations, undergoing
     very decided modifications, when favourably
      placed for that purpose ; by tribes inhabiting
      similar districts , and obviously tracing their origin
      to similar sources-the one becoming cultivators
     and men of settled habits, and quickly losing their
      coarseness of bodily form-the other leading a
      doubtful and precarious existence , depending for
     support upon the uncertain products of the chase
      or plunder, and retaining all their aboriginal ug-
      liness and peculiarities .
       If mankind has its origin from one common

    stock-one single progenitor -from one sole
   Adam, according to the Mosaical and received
    account of creation , then must all men have the
    same capabilities for developing, when placed
    under the operation of favourable causes, per-
    sonal perfection, in the understood acceptation of
    the word . Whether Adam was a man of colour,
    or whether he was a man possessing the physical
     traits of the division of mankind classed as the
    Caucasian variety , those men who have devoted
                                           *
    the most attention to the subject , and whose
    opinions are of the greatest value, differ in their
    conclusions . If an argument might be applied ,
    drawn from the known changes which have been
    observed to occur as to figure , if not as to colour,
    the preponderance of belief would be on the side
    which classed him as a genuine Ethiopian ; and
    this, too , is the opinion which can be most
    completely authenticated by the present state of
    knowledge on these subjects . It seems likewise ,
    on the whole, more easy to explain the conversion
    of a coloured race into a white , than of a white
    race into a coloured .
     If it were necessary to bring forward as proofs ,
    other quotations from the historians of mankind ,
    to substantiate the position , that the manufactur-
    ing population, in consequence of their near
    approach to barbarous and uncivilized modes of
     life must exhibit great inferiority in figure and
    personal proportion , they might be readily found .

     wide distinction of caste separates them from
      their superiors- wherever their manners and do-
     mestic habits are coarse and improvident- their
     bodies uniformly become stunted , ill-shaped ,
     wanting elegance of contour, and that develop-
     ment and arrangement of parts constituting beauty.
     The universality of this truth needs no confirma-
      tion or illustration to those who have read or in-
     quired into the subject, or whose observation has
     been exercised upon a comparison of bodily forms,
      infinitely varied as they are , in common society.
     The population engaged in manufactures , since
     the application of the steam-engine has so as-
     similated and simplified their condition, offers an
     admirable field for examining how far external
     causes , aided by morals, can modify the physical
     proportions of man, and how far this modification
      is likely to influence the offspring of parents thus
     -changed , providing the same causes continue to
     operate through several successive generations .
      The personal appearance of the domestic ma-
     nufacturer is still well remembered by those
     whose memories carry them back to the days
     of quoit and cricket- playing- wakes- May-day
      revels-Christmas firesides , and a host of other
      memorabilia, now ranked but as things that were !
     Some faint traces of these by-gone times are still
     discoverable in the remoter districts : they are ,
     however, only the " disjecta membra " of a whole
      division of the community.

    and with an arched instep ; ruddy complexioned ;
     his general contour rounded from the deposition
    of adipose matter, and from muscular develop-
    ment, possessing considerable physical power, and
    delighting in athletic sports. Not called into ac-
     tive and permanent labour till his frame was to
    some extent set, and his bony system perfected ,
    he ran no danger of any shrinking or yielding in
    these parts ; neither were his animal passions
    pushed into premature activity by high atmo-
    spheric temperature, aided in its exciting opera-
    tion by vicious example at home and abroad .
    His offspring were , like himself, a chubby and
    rosy-faced set of urchins- healthy from their
     birth upward ; tended by affectionate mothers ,
    whose domestic occupations never interfered with
     their maternal duties. Permitted to range at will
     in the free and balmy air of heaven , their young
    minds inhaled a love of nature with their daily

    were fostered and directed under the eye and

      Their stature low-the average height of four
      hundred men , measured at different times , and
       different places , being five feet six inches . Their
      limbs slender , and playing badly and ungrace-
       fully . A very general bowing of the legs. Great
      numbers of girls and women walking lamely or
      awkwardly, with raised chests and spinal flex-
      ures . Nearly all have flat feet, accompanied with
      a down-tread , differing very widely from the
       elasticity of action in the foot and ancle , attendant
      upon perfect formation . Hair thin and straight-
      many of the men having but little beard, and
      that in patches of a few hairs , much resembling
       its growth among the red men of America. A
       spiritless and dejected air, a sprawling and wide
      action of the legs , and an appearance , taken as a
      whole, giving the world but " little assurance of
      a man," or if so, " most sadly cheated of his fair
      proportions ." Beauty of face and form are both
       lost in angularity, while the flesh is soft and
      flabby to the touch , yielding no " living rebound
      beneath the finger . The hurry and anxiety of
      this juncture brings out very strongly all their
      manifold imperfections .

    of society, there are certainly to be found many
     exquisite specimens of female loveliness -many
     exceedingly graceful and feminine beings . They
    may be seen in abundance in all the social circles ,
     in places of amusement and parade , in which, like
     the sex all the world over, they naturally assemble
   -a passion for admiration and attention forming
    an essential and important portion of woman's cha-
     racter, and one too of the utmost value , and
    worthy every cultivation . But these must not be
    sought for amongst the precociously developed
     girls herding in factories . Here , on the contrary,
     will be found an utter absence of grace and femi-
     nine manners -a peculiar rancous or rough timbre
     of voice- no such thing as speaking soft and low,
    " that most excellent thing in woman , "" a [pecu-]
     liarity owing to various causes , a principal one of
    which is, too early sexual excitement , producing
    a state of vocal organs closely resembling that of
     the male . Here is no delicacy of figure , no
      66 grace in all her steps ," no " heaven within her
     eye, " no elegance of tournure , no retiring bash-
     fulness , no coy reserve, no indication that a
    woman's soul dwells there in all its young loveli-
     ness , with its host of hidden delights , waiting
     but the touch of some congenial spirit to awaken
     all its sensibilities and passions ; but in their
     place an awkward and ungainly figure ; -limbs
     badly moulded from imperfect nutrition-a bony

      upon utility—and a general aspect of coarseness
      and a vulgarity of expression quite opposed to all
      ideas of excellencies in the moral and physical
       attributes of the sex .
       There is something in the female figure strongly
       indicative of its aptitude for the performance of
       certain functions peculiar to her sex. Child-
      bearing is one of these , and the nourishment [she]
       is subsequently destined to afford her offspring
      another. The gait of women who labour under
      any material alteration in the axis of thigh [-] bone
       is singular- a sort of waddle [,] an alternate [side-]
      long progression . This alteration is brought
      about by any change in the direction or [bearing]
       of its socket , which is seated in the [pelvis]-[ or]
      by changes operated upon the thigh[-]bone itself-
       or by changes in the direction of the [action][ of]
       certain great muscles which have their origin on
      the spine, pelvis , or adjacent parts [,] -all of which
       are liable to be influenced more or less by [the]
      circumstances in which she spends her infant
      years , and by that derangement in the prima [viæ][,]
      and their effects, which her occupation and[ habits]
      expose her to . This gait may be detected in
       great numbers of factory girls and women , and is
      exceedingly ungraceful - ungraceful in itself[,] and
        still more so in its impression upon the mind [,] by
      the evidence it gives of certain alterations [in] [form]
       peculiarly unsexual . Neither is the condition of
      those organs from which the child is to derive [its]
       first aliment less strikingly illustrative of their

     habits . Very early in life , from ten to fourteen
    years , the breasts are often found large and firm ,
    and highly sensitive , whilst at a later period- at
    a period indeed when they should shew the
     greatest activity and vital energy - when in fact
    they have children to support from them, they
     are soft , flaccid , pendulous , and very unirritable
      both states giving the most [decisive] [proofs][ of]
     perversion in the usual functional adaptation of
    of
      parts .
     The moral influence of woman upon man's
     character and domestic happiness , is mainly
     attributable to her natural and instinctive habits .
    Her love , her tenderness , her affectionate solicitude
     for his comfort and enjoyment, her devotedness ,
    her unwearying care, her maternal fondnesses ,
    her conjugal attractions , exercise a most en-
    nobling impression upon his nature , and do more
    towards making him a good husband , a good
     father, and an useful citizen , than all the dogmas
    of political economy. But the factory woman
    cannot have this beneficial agency upon man's
    character. Her instincts , from their earliest birth ,
    have been thwarted and pushed aside from their
    proper channels ; they have had no field in which
    they could be cultivated , no home where their
    aberrations might have been checked , no legiti-
    mate object on which her love could be lavished ;
    on the reverse , -her passions have been prema-
    turely developed , her physical organization sti-
    mulated into precocious activity, her social affec-

       tions utterly blighted , her person rendered unin-
      viting by its want of feminine gracefulness ; her
      occupation has destroyed her home sympathies
      and maternal affections, and finally, in place of
      seeking her pleasures , enjoyments , and happiness
      in ministering to the wants and welfare of her
      household , she seeks her gratification in other,
       less pure and less womanly stimuli, fatal alike to
      her health, comfort, and appearance .
       Under these circumstances , woman is reduced
      to precisely the same grade in the social rank
      which she holds in half civilized countries . She
       is no longer the companion of man , in the proper
      meaning of the term ; but is a mere instrument of
      labour, and a creature for satisfying his grosser
      appetites . It is true , her condition differs in some
      respects from that of her sex in countries which
      are called savage ; she is not the slave, though
      she is no longer the companion of man ; neither is
      she the subordinate being whose interests are
      esteemed so secondary as to be totally unre-
      garded ; but, as far as concerns the better portion
      of her attributes, she is upon the same degraded
      level .
       Nothing would tend more to elevate the moral
      condition of the manufacturing population , than
      the restoration of woman to her proper social
      rank ; nothing would exercise greater influence
      upon the form and growth of her offspring, than
      her devotion to those womanly occupations which
      would render her a denizen of home. No great

      step can be made till she is snatched from unre-
      mitting toil, and made what Nature meant she
      should be the centre of a system of social
      delights . Domestic avocations are those which
      are her peculiar lot . The poor man who suffers
      his wife to work, separated from him and from
     home, is a bad calculator. It destroys domestic
     economy, without which no earnings are sufficient
      to render him comfortable ; it produces separate
      interests, and separate sets of feelings- they lose
      their mutual dependence upon each other- their
      offspring is suffered to starve or perish-to
     become, even as a child , the imitator of their bad
     example- to have its frame permanently injured
     -to acquire bodily conditions which it must , in
      its turn , transmit to its own children--for, by their
     being thus early implanted , they become part and
     parcel of its very nature-till , in the end , a point
     of physical declension will be reached , from
     which the return to a condition approximating to
     that of the more perfect and valuable part of the
     species, must be by slow and painful gradations .
      Another circumstance, which shews very de-
     cidedly the extent of moral and social degradation
     in the female sex among this population , and
     which reduces them below the level of the un-
     tutored savage, is this- that upwards of two-thirds
     of all the children born to this class in Manchester
     are brought into the world by the aid ofpublic cha-
      rity ; that decent and proper pride , which should
     lead women to prepare for an event so interesting

      * " The number of married women delivered annually by
      the Manchester Lying-in Charity on the average of the last two
      years is upwards of four thousand three hundred. Now it is
      well known to those conversant with statistics, that the number
      of baptisms occurring annually in England is in the proportion
      of one baptism to thirty-four inhabitants nearly. This is about
      the average for the kingdom . But the births are somewhat
      more numerous than the baptisms, because some children are
        still-born, and others die before they are baptized, and some
       are christened who are not entered into the public registers.
     When we have made allowances for these incidental circum-

     heir-loom , their weakened constitution , attended
     with all its liabilities to physical inferiority. That

     duce fine and robust offspring , goes for nothing ;

    how far this may extend , no human sagacity can

     of the present mode of manufacture . Steam ,

    ployed by him, is one very powerful cause which
    tends to keep down their moral habits and their
     physical condition. Living, as the majority of
    the operatives do , in the midst of large towns , and
     incessantly occupied , they see nothing around
    them but beings like themselves . There is no
    middle class to which they can look for counte-
     nance and example . The family of their employer
     they either detest, and studiously avoid imitating
     its manners, however humbly or remotely , or
     they see so little of it , and are treated so coldly
    and harshly by it, that they nurse their own gross-
     ness in direct and avowed opposition to it.
     The force of external circumstances in modi-
     fying bodily form , is seen equally forcibly, in
     another and more pleasing point of view, in the
     manufacturing districts . Many of the masters
     have raised themselves from the very humblest
     rank of labourers-in many instances after a family
     had been born to them in their humility. These
     individuals with their families , at this period , of
     course, possessed all the traits distinguishing their
     grade , both moral and physical . Change of con-
     dition , better food , better clothing , better hous-
     ing, constant cleanliness, mental cultivation , the
     force of example in the higher order of society in
     which they are now placed , have gradually con-
     verted them into respectable and even handsome
     families . The first remove places them still more
     favourably, and ceteris paribus , they become

     remarks an intelligent and extensive manufac-
      turer, in his evidence before a Committee of the
     House of Commons, on the employment of Child-
     ren in Manufactories, " produced a complete
      revolution in the spinning manufactures of cotton ,
     of wool, and of flax , which might now be more
     properly termed mechanical productions : by the
      application of the power of waterfalls, and of
     ingenious mechanism , adults were superseded by
      children, whose wages were lower, and who soon
      acquired a great dexterity : the production of the
      manufacturers was enormously increased , because
     the extraordinary cheapness produced a con-
      sumption in proportion to the great augmen-
      tation of the wealth and revenue of the nation.
     The very moderate exertion of the children , and
      the great expense of the mechanism , introduced
      • the custom of working twelve hours per day in
      the mills . Under these circumstances , it became
      the duty and the advantage of every proprietor,
      to render his mill as healthy as possible, by clean-
      liness , ventilation, spaciousness, and temperature ,
     and to interest himself generally for those em-
      ployed by him . As the children grew to be
      adults , notwithstanding their acquired expertness ,
      they became too big for the machinery , and their
      labour too expensive . In consequence of the
      introduction of the revolving steam engine , facto-
       ries were established in manufacturing towns :
      the establishments in manufacturing towns were
      more calculated for adults , and machines of

     greater size and complication were constructed

     business continued to extend , a numerous popu-
     "
     lation of children would have been formed , and
     employed in remote situations , without an ade-
     quate demand for their labour when adults ; -the
     employment of adults by such suitable establish-
     ments in manufacturing towns therefore obviated
      this evil . It has likewise produced that excellence
     in the operations which could never have been
     obtained or rewarded , except in the great and
     open market of talents , in large towns . The
     labour of adults is infinitely more regular in ma-
     chinery than in manual employment , but can never
     be controlled and reduced to the uniformity of attend-
     ance of children . On the other side, they are
     capable of greater exertion , and possess far
     greater skill. The system of employing adults ,
     restores society to its proper direction , which had
     been changed by sudden discoveries, and proba-
     bly neither a younger nor a greater number of
     children will be required to be trained in the
     mills upon the new scale , than that proportion
     which is necessary to supply the demand for
     adults in many other labouring classes of society. "
      The simplicity of the first machines adapted
     for spinning, and their small size , fitted them
     for being tended by children . The localities in
     which the mills were at first chiefly erected , for
     the convenience of water power, were often

     remote from towns or villages , from which alone
     an adequate supply of hands could be obtained :
     hence , in the early period of mill labour, appren-
      tices, from six to twelve years of age , were almost
     the only workers . These apprentices were chiefly
     taken from the workhouses of large towns , such as
     London, Birmingham , &c . , and from foundling hos-
      pitals , and transmitted in droves* to the different
      mills , where , in many instances , it is to be feared ,
     they suffered very severely . Villages , however,
     sprung up in the vicinity of the mills , and the
      parents of children very naturally took advantage
     of their labour, and hence , free labourers became
     superadded , and , in time , displaced the apprentice
     system, to a considerable degree . The construc-
      tion of the first mills was , of course , fitted only
      for small machines ; they were consequently small,
     and the rooms in them were low, and of very
     contracted dimensions , and very little precaution
     used, either as to ventilation or temperature . The
     time of labour was extended to twelve hours ,
     with very little interval ; the immense profits
     which accrued from their produce, pushing aside
      all ulterior considerations . Nor was this all :
      unsatisfied with the day labour, the night was
     almost uniformly spent by one portion of the
     hands in the mill ; the owners or occupiers thus
       * Mr. Arkwright's first mills were almost entirely filled with
      very young children . The house of Peel and Co. employed at
      one time a thousand of these children.

    securing twenty - three hours out of the twenty-
    four, for making his machinery valuable .
     There cannot be a question but , that child[-][labour][,]
    urged to this extent, and under these circum-
    stances, was prejudicial in every way ; and in
    1796 , the evil of it had aroused the [attention] [of]
    various philanthropic individuals [,] amongst whom
    the name of Dr. Percival stands [conspicuously]
    forward, and he , in conjunction with others ,
     stirred themselves to produce some [alteration] [and]
    amendment . On the establishment of the Man-
    chester Board of Health [,] the following [statement]
    was made by him, on the 15th of January[ ,][ 1796][ :]
    " The Board have had their [attention][ particularly]
    directed to the large cotton factories[ ,][ established]
    in the neighbourhood and town of Manchester[ ;]
    and they feel it a duty incumbent on them[,][ to] [lay]
    before the public the result of their [inquiries][ :]-
     1. It appears that the children and [others][ ,] who
    work in the large cotton factories , are peculiarly
    disposed to be affected by the contagion of
     fever ; and that when such infection is received[ ,]
     it is rapidly propagated [,] not only amongst [those]
    who are crowded together in the same apart-
    ments, but in the families and neighbourhoods
    to which they belong. 2. The large factories
    are generally injurious to those employed [in] them [,]
    even when no particular diseases prevail[,] from [the]
    close confinement which is [enjoined][ ,][ and][ from][ the]
     debilitating effects of hot or impure [air][,][ and][ from]
    the want of the active exercises which [nature]

     points out as essential in childhood and youth ,
     to invigorate the system, and to fit our species
     for the employments and the duties of manhood.
      3. The untimely labour of the night, and the
     protracted labour of the day, with respect to chil-
     dren, not only tends to diminish future expecta-
      tions , as to the general sum of life and industry ,
     by impairing the strength, and destroying the
      vital stamina of the rising generation, but it too
      often gives encouragement to idleness, extrava-
     gance , and profligacy in the parents, who contrary
      to the law of nature , subsist by the oppression of
      their children . 4. It appears that the children
     employed in factories, are generally debarred
     from all opportunities of education , and from
     moral and religious instruction ."
       According to the evidence of Sir R. Peel , who
     was himself very extensively engaged in manu-
      factures at this period , contagious and epidemic
      diseases were very common in the people, or
      rather children , employed in these badly con-
      structed mills , and under the influence of such
      continuous labour . He remarks that they were
      uniformly of stinted growth , and that although in
      his own case they were fed and lodged under his
      roof and at his own expense, they still looked to
     be in ill- health . That gross mismanagement
      existed in numberless instances there can be no
     doubt and that these unprotected creatures, thus
     thrown entirely into the power of the manufac-
      turer, were over-worked , often badly fed , and

    worse treated . No wonder can be felt, that these
    glaring mischiefs attracted observation , and finally
    led to the passing of the Apprentice Bill * —a bill {
    intended to regulate these matters . It may be
    questioned whether the bill of itself did much
    good , but from the discussions it excited , and the
    vast superiority displayed by some mills over
    others , when general inquiries were made , -very
     beneficial consequences were the result, and some
     attention began to be paid both to the better
    ordering of the mills , and to the welfare of the
     children . As these establishments went on in-
    creasing, a new population sprung up around them ,
    and in a few years free labour quite displaced
    the prior hands . The machines for spinning
    were day after day becoming more bulky, and
    requiring greater skill and exertion for producing
     fine numbers , so that adults gradually found their
    way to them. The application of steam as a
    moving power, which became general from 1801
    to 1804, produced a great change in all respects .
     It did away with the necessity for so much water
    power, and hence mills were more commonly
     built in towns or populous districts favourable as
     to coal , &c . , and where a population was at hand
     for their occupation . The uniformity, the in-
    creased rapidity of motion , and the greater size
     of the machines, called in some departments for
     active labour, and grown up men and women

    were now largely engaged in spinning ;-but still
     children formed the majority of hands, many
     processes being better calculated for them than
     for adults. But they were not put to work quite
     so young, few before ten years of age- which in
     fact the masters found to be as soon as they could
    be properly useful .
     The hours of labour have not undergone any
     very material alteration , since the universal appli-
     cation of steam , and since the doing away with
     night labour as a general custom . Notwith-
     standing this the condition of the children has
     undergone great amelioration . This has arisen
     not from increased wages, but from the improve-
    ment in the construction of the mills . Subse-
     quent to 1806, when the steam loom was first
     brought into operation , many of the first mills
    were either much enlarged, or in very numerous
     examples abandoned by the more wealthy manu-
     facturers, and in their stead large buildings were
     erected , fitted to receive , in addition to the spin-
     ning processes , a quantity of looms . Nor was this
     increase in size the only advantage . The rooms
     were much more lofty, generally of large propor-
     tions , had numerous windows , so arranged as to
     afford excellent ventilation, whilst improved
     modes of warming them did away with many of
     the inconveniences which had hitherto attended
     upon this necessary portion of their interior eco-
    nomy . This consisted in carrying through the
     rooms pipes conveying steam , or heated air,

     which enabled the overlooker to regulate the
     temperature according to the necessity of the
     season. Various improvements took place in the
     cleaning the cotton , so as to free the [mill] [from][ a]
     great part ofthe flue or fine cottony down[,][ which]
     in the old mills , spinning coarse numbers , had
     been nearly suffocating : cleanliness began to be
     cultivated , and this was materially aided by the
     use of cast iron floors , which were much more
     easily cleaned than wood , which had absorbed
     the oil droppings, and soon became offensive [and]
     exceedingly difficult to get off[ ;] added [to][ which]
    was the gradual substitution of iron [in] [the][ frame-]
     work of machinery, which by its diminished bulk
     materially increased the empty space in the rooms [,]
     the wooden frames having been large and [massy] [,]
     and always getting filled with dirt[.]
     The number of young persons employed in
     factories since the breaking up of apprentice
     system, and since the divisions of labourers have
     fairly settled themselves, has not till of late
     years varied very largely, when estimated as to
     the proportion they bear to the remainder of the
     hands . In 1816, a return from forty-one mills , in
     Scotland, gave a total of 10,000 persons engaged
     in them . Of this number

    A similar return from 48 mills in Manchester
    gave a total of 12,940 hands .
     Under 10, 793 ; 10 to 18 , 5460 ; above 18 , 6687 .
      This approximates very nearly to the table
     first given.
     A return from 36 mills in Stockport, in 1833 ,
    gave a total of 11,444.
      Under 10 , 320 ; 10 to 18 , 4017 ; above 18,7,101 .
     The diversity in the foregoing tables arises from
     several causes . Wherever spinning is more espe-
     cially prosecuted , there the number of hands under
     eighteen years [of][ age][ will][ appear][ porportionately]
     incréased ; and wherever weaving is the staple
     manufacture , there the number of hands upwards
     of eighteen will be in greater ratio . There can
    be no question indeed, but that since steam-
     weaving became so general as to supersede the
     hand-loom, the number of adults engaged in the
     mills has been progressively advancing ; inasmuch
     that very young children are not competent to
     take charge of a steam-loom . The individuals
     employed at them are chiefly girls and young
    women from sixteen to twenty -two or twenty-
     three years of age ; indeed the weavers in many
     mills are exclusively females, and it is not likely
     that any very material alteration in this respect
      will occur. In spinning, children are as valuable
     workers in many of its processes as adults , in some
     degree more so .
      Yet a change is gradually creeping over the
     condition of the operatives, and a disposition is

     developing itself to have recourse to the labour of
    women and children in preference to adults . The
     causes which have led to this are , the great im-
    provements which are taking place in machinery,
    and its application to an infinite variety of minute
     operations requiring the nicest management, and
    the requisite power being given by steam .
     The labourer is indeed become a subsidiary to
     this power. Already he is condemned hour after
    hour, day after day, to watch and minister to
         -
     its operations , to become himself as much a part
    of its mechanism as its cranks and cog- wheels , -
    already to feel that he is but a portion of a mighty
    machine, every improved application of which,
    every addition to its Briareus-like arms , rapidly
    lessen his importance , and tend to drive him from
    a participation with it, as the most expensive and
    unmanageable part of its materials .
     The contest however between human and steam
    power, as applied to manufactures , is not yet so
     far advanced as to annihilate its value to its pos-
     sessor. In another portion of this work it is
     satisfactorily shewn that the labourer, though
    losing rapidly his independent character, is paid
     for his labour a sum amply sufficient, when
    properly applied , to supply all his natural wants,
    and to provide him with comforts and opportuni-
     ties for making provision for sickness or old age,
    without becoming a burden upon the fixed capital
    of the nation. This observation , it must be under-
    stood , refers to that portion only of manufac-

     turers engaged in power-loom weaving and spin-
     ning with their various processes . The hand-
    loom weavers are , on the contrary , crushed by
     their mighty opponent to the dust, and keep up a
     warfare with it upon the most unequal and unte-
     nable grounds .
     The necessity for human power thus gradually
     yielding before another and more subservient one ,
     has had, in the first place, the effect of rendering
     adult labour of no greater value than that of the
     infant, or girl ; mere watchers , suppliers of the
     wants of machinery, requiring in the great majo-
     rity of its operations no physical or intellectual
     exertion ; and the adult male has begun slowly to
     give way, and his place been supplied by those
    who in the usual order of things were dependent
    upon him for their support.
      It may be asked why, if adult labour was still
     efficacious , though its physical and intellectual
     energies were not demanded , it was thrown aside,
     and women and children brought to perform its
     functions ; thus reversing the law generally ac-
     knowledged, that man , as a husband and a father,
     should furnish his wife and family with support,
      till such periods as his offspring were themselves
     arrived at an age , when the development of their
     physical powers fitted them for earning a separate
     and independent support, or at least assisting
     their parent, and lessening in some degree his
     burdens. Why take from their homes and proper
     occupation women and children , and employ them

    to the exclusion of their husbands and fathers ,
    and subject them to labour which , in the instance
    of the children, their physical organization was
    unable to bear, and in that of the women must of
     necessity lead to the neglect of all the domestic
     offices -household economy-and conjugal and
    maternal duties ; why throw the active labourer
    into idleness and dependence , and thus lower
    immensely his moral importance ? and why thus ,
    laying the axe to the root of the social confede-
    racy, pave the way for breaking up the bonds
    which hold society together, and which are the
     basis of national and domestic happiness and
     virtue?
     The previous sketch of the progress ofthe ma
     factures in reference to machinery and its influ-
    ence upon labour, and the conditions and locali-
     ties in which the mills were first established[ ,][ will]
     explain the employment of children in the spinning
    department to the exclusion of adults [;] the intro-
     duction of the steam -loom , the subsequent ex-
     cellence and simplification of the machinery—and
     lastly, a history of the combinations [,] will be [suffi-]
     cient to unravel the question [,] and to explain

     having been found difficult to manage, and not

     sure , been supplied by children and women ;

     regard to infant labour, in its moral and physical

     partly discussed in another portion of this work . *
    The important question of infant labour, as to
     health and physical development, two points
     intimately connected with the future welfare ,
     well-being, and happiness of the individuals, now
     remains to be examined .
     The material organization of childhood is de-
     cidedly unfavourable to labour. The functions of
     nutrition , which are those peculiarly active , leave
     but little of either nervous or muscular energy ,
    beyond what is required for their due supply.
    The whole body is in a state of rapid alteration ;
     full of vascular excitement , and requiring long pe-
     riods of repose . The constitution at large is
    very excitable , abounding in vitality , and prone
     to irregular action . The osseous system is in-
    complete ; its structure, as yet, being in a very
     great proportion cartilaginous , and hence beauti-
     fully adapted for accommodating itself to the
    growth and extension of the body. It is, how-
     ever, soft, yielding, bends beneath pressure , and
     is easily made to assume curvatures and altera-
     tions in direction , incompatible , more or less , with

    the natural arrangements , which are, in all in-
    stances , full of harmony and architectural and me-
    chanical beauties . The long bones , those of the
    arms and legs , do not become completely ossified
     till the body has attained its full growth . The
    flat bones-those of the head , pelvis , &c . , become
    hard sooner, serving, as they do, for the walls of
    cavities or supports for delicate and important
    viscera, essential to life .

      having been found difficult to manage, and not
     more productive , -its place has , in a great mea-
      sure , been supplied by children and women ;
     and hence the outcry which has been raised with
      regard to infant labour, in its moral and physical
      bearings. The moral considerations have been
      partly discussed in another portion of this work . *
     The important question of infant labour, as to
      health and physical development, two points
      intimately connected with the future welfare ,
      well -being , and happiness of the individuals , now
      remains to be examined .
      The material organization of childhood is de-
      cidedly unfavourable to labour . The functions of
      nutrition , which are those peculiarly active , leave
      but little of either nervous or muscular energy ,
     beyond what is required for their due supply.
     The whole body is in a state of rapid alteration ;
       full of vascular excitement , and requiring long pe-
      riods of repose . The constitution at large is
      very excitable , abounding in vitality, and prone
      to irregular action . The osseous system is in-
      complete ; its structure , as yet, being in a very
      great proportion cartilaginous , and hence beauti-
      fully adapted for accommodating itself to the
     growth and extension of the body. It is, how-
      ever, soft, yielding, bends beneath pressure , and
       is easily made to assume curvatures and altera-
      tions in direction , incompatible , more or less , with

     the natural arrangements , which are, in all in-
     stances , full of harmony and architectural and me-
     chanical beauties . The long bones , those of the
     arms and legs , do not become completely ossified
      till the body has attained its full growth. The
     flat bones-those of the head , pelvis, &c . , become
     hard sooner, serving , as they do , for the walls of
     cavities or supports for delicate and important
     viscera, essential to life.

      system is a great series of detached portions of
     bone , incapable of supporting the soft parts with-
      out yielding beneath their weight-the connecting
     medium between them (cartilage) is flexible ; the
      only portions which have assumed a very decided
      formation being those connected with respiration .
      Month after month , as the infant acquires mus-
      cular vigour, the bones solidify in ratio as the
      peculiar organs are called into play. Point after
      point hardens , and is connected with the shafts
      of the long bones, or firm ridges spring up along
      the surface of the flat bones , giving origin or
      insertion to the moving powers which are destined
      to enable the child to perform the actions of
      locomotion, lifting weights , &c . &c .
        It is not till complete growth has been attained ,
     which is from the seventeenth to the twentieth
      year, that all the bones are completely ossified ,
     and till this period they are more or less liable to
      give way under continued pressure. They have ,
     however, assumed a very considerable firmness of
      structure prior to this, and little danger need be
     apprehended of evil consequences from any
     common labour or exertion which the purposes of
       life [require] .
      The system of bones-the skeleton - is the
      basis or frame-work on which all the soft parts
      are, as it were , hung. It sustains their weight,
      affords points of support for muscular action , and
     by the beauty and order of its articulations , is
      capable of assuming a variety of directions, while

     its symmetrical proportion is most perfect, and
    admirably adapted for the packing and convenient
    arrangement of all the numberless components of
    which a man's body is made up.
     During the growth of the child , then , its bones are
    to some extent soft and yielding , —a circumstance
    familiar to many mothers , in whose infants the
    bony structure has not, from some fault in its
    peculiar nutrition , gone on apace with muscular
    development ; and which , by inducing the child to
    support its weight upon its feet , its legs give way
    beneath it and bow out, -a very common case in
    strumous families .
      It has been said that the child's system was one
    full ofexcitement , ofrapid changes in structure , and
    that its sensibilities were acute . The world brings
    to the infant, for many years, a constant succession
    of new sensations, and its activity, its variable-
    ness , its jocund laugh, its quiet repose, are all
    evidences that, like the young of other animals, its
    life was intended by the Creator for unrestricted
    bodily enjoyment , for to it motion itselfever seems
    a high gratification .
    No one familiar with the wants and habits of a
    child is ignorant how irksome confinement is to
    it-how utterly unfit it is for settled occupations
   -how listless and heartless it speedily becomes
   when shut out from its instinctive mode of life-
   how soon it droops and pines , and loses the vigour
   and freshness ofthe wild flower.

      ofnecessity interfere with nutrition ; for in fact the
      terms may be considered as almost synonymous .
     The growth of every part depends intimately upon
      this first process being well performed . What-
      ever interferes with this, deranges the whole circle
      of the animal economy, and if continued, will lay
      the foundation for a series of irregular actions ,
      which may either run into scrofula, if such taint
      already exists, or may bring about , independently
      ofsuch taint, the same or some analogous affection .
      Whatever vitiates this series of operations--and
       it is liable to be vitiated by many causes- puts
      the whole animal machine out of equilibrium ; and
      irregular formations , strumous swellings of the
      concellated heads of the long bones, as at the
      knees , ancles , elbows and wrists , or a similar train
      of evils in the glandular structure , evidenced by
      swellings in the neck , terminating in sores dif-
       ficult to heal , or of the mesenteric or other glands
      of the abdomen, or of derangements in the mu-
      cous surfaces of the mouth , eyes, breathing ap-
      paratus, bowels, &c . &c.- all these are results ,
      more or less marked , of any continued derange-
      ment in that most important function of childhood
      -nutrition .
       Light, air, recreation , freedom from toil , proper
      clothing, wholesome food , attention to the bowels ,
     &c. , are all essential to this function being well
      performed . Children placed even under the most

    ment, shew very plainly their want of it. In
    fashionable boarding- schools , and in private fami-
     lies , where tuition is commenced early, and where
     little proper exercise is taken , but where every
    attention is paid to food , &c . , the pallid face and
     spiritless demeanour of the children very soon
    shew that nothing can compensate for the ab-
    straction of their necessary stimuli .
     The factory child, * from the very earliest [period]
    of its existence, is , in large towns subjected to [all]
    the necessary causes for the production of the
    physical evils , resulting from derangement of [the]
    digestive organs . Its food is coarse , and the
    times of feeding irregular [;] it is exposed to cold ,
     ill clad, allowed to be filthy [.] It inhales the im-
    pure atmosphere of a badly ventilated and un-
    cleanly house, and the equally impure one[ of][ an]
    unpaved and unsoughed street ; is allowed to get
    wet, goes barefoot , no attention is paid to its
     dietetic comforts, and consequently vast numbers
    die very young, and the remainder who live ex-
     hibit symptoms that they have suffered from neg-
     lect and exposure . They have pale and flaccid [fea-]
    tures , a stunted growth , very often tumid bellies[ ,]

    been permitted to go wrong[.] The effect of all the
    other causes is aided by the abominable practice[ ,]

      children with quack and patent medicines, to
      quiet their irritability, increased as it is by their
      digestive derangement, or the equally pernicious
      one of giving them gin for the same purpose . *
      Whatever tends to disturb that function[ ,] the
      products of which furnish the materials [for][ the]
      building up of the body, or which alters , and
      depraves those materials , must necessarily im-
       " In consequence of the absence of the mothers, these
       children are entrusted, in a vast majority of cases, to the care of
       others, often of elderly females. These women often undertake
      the care of several infants at the same time ; the children are
       restless and irritable from being deprived of a supply of their
       natural food (as when the mothers suckle them they can only
      perform that duty in the intervals of labour) , and the almost
       universal practice amongst them is to still the cries of the
       infant by administering opiates, which are sold for the purpose
      under several well known and popular forms. The quantity of
      opium which from habit some children become capable of
      taking is almost incredible, and the effects are correspondingly
       destructive. Even when the children have a healthy appear-
      ance at birth, they almost uniformly become in a few months
      puny and sickly in their aspect, and many fall victims to
       bronchitis, hydrocephalus, and other diseases, produced by
      want of care, and the pernicious habits we have detailed . We
      may mention, also, that spirits, particularly gin , are given fre-
       quently when the infants appear to suffer from pain in the
      bowels, which from injurious diet is very common among
      them."-Inquiry, &c. p. 17.
      " The child is ill-fed , dirty, ill-clothed-exposed to cold and
       neglect, and in consequence more than one half of the offspring
      of the poor die before they have completed their fifth year.
      The strongest survive, but the same causes which destroy the
      weakest, impair the vigour of the more robust, and hence the
       children of our manufacturing population are proverbially pale

       disease."-Dr. Kay's pamphlet, p. 70.

    pede and retard the completion of the healthy
    structure of the system . In childhood , much has
    to be done in these respects ; muscles have to be
    strengthened and brought into use ; the bony
     fabric solidified ; growth carried on, by the de-
    position of new matter in every portion of the
    body ; preparation made for sexual development :
     all these keep the feeders in incessant action .
    The vessels which are to be the first stage in
    preparing the new matter, and carrying it to its
     final depositories , are all connected with the
    alimentary canal : these convey the chyle they
    have elminated from the food . If, however, this
    chyle is imperfectly formed, which must inevi-
    tably be the case when digestion is impaired by
    the causes already mentioned , it cannot fulfil per-
     fectly its destined offices in the system- growth
     is retarded , and particular structures unfinished .
     The formation of bone, -the necessary earthy
    deposit upon which its hardness depends , is one
    singularly under the influence of the digestive
    operations . Ricketty children are ever wrong in
    this respect the food they take furnishes but
     little nutriment ; their bowels are disturbed ; as-
    similation goes on imperfectly ; all the pro-
    cesses connected with absorption and deposition
    are irregular , and do not preserve that reciprocity
    of action, that balance of quantity, which is
    necessary for proper growth.
     Without going more diffusely into the pathology
    of the two diseases , scrofula and rickets , which

```

```
      are in their origin clearly traceable to disturbed
      digestion , it may be sufficient to state, that both,
     when they have been fairly established , seem to
      be transmissible from parent to child- to become
      hereditary . By the term hereditary , however,
      when applied to diseases , whether mental or phy-
       sical, it must be understood only in a general
      sense, as meaning, that a parent endows his off-
       spring with certain peculiarities of constitution ,
       certain tendencies to take on diseased actions-
      not that he transmits the disease in its distinct
      form , but that he gives a liability to have it called
       into action by causes which would not develope a
       similar disease in a child descended from parents
       perfectly free from any such taint . With scrofula
       this is decidedly the case- scrofulous parents very
       frequently having offspring with all the traces of
       its peculiar diathesis --light eyes , fair skin, &c .
     &c . With rickets this transmission is less ob-
       servable , probably because its incipient stages
       are not so strongly marked .
       The factory child then , from its birth [,] is [placed]
      under circumstances certain to deprave [its][ nu-]
       tritive functions , and to produce effects [injurious]
       to the healthy stamina of its physical[ organization][ .]
       Its soft parts become flabby, relaxed [,] [open] to
       disease ; its osseous system becomes firm very
       slowly and irregularly, yields to superincumbent
       weight, producing deformity more or less marked[ ,]
      and more or less prejudicial[,] as affecting parts
      more or less connected with important outlets [or]
       cavities .

     But farther than this , the child which is de-
    scended from parents who have themselves been
    subjected to like causes of physical debility, *
    must have an organization weakly from its very
    origin ; must have inherited , to some extent, their
    debilitated constitution , and in consequence be
    much less able to resist the influence of the un-
    favourable conditions, to which it is exposed
    subsequent to birth.
     This condition , it must be constantly [borne][ in]
    mind, has• nothing to do with labour-[as] [yet][ the]
     child has undergone none : it has been allowed [to]
    run wild, half-clad and half-starved[ .] It is of the ut-
    most consequence to a correct understanding [of]
    the question of infant employment[,] that [this] [pre-]
    liminary state should be properly considered [and]
     correctly appreciated . It would , indeed , be a
    monstrous perversion of everything like [justice] [,]
    both to the masters and to the system of [factory-]
    labour, to burden the one with the moral re-
     sponsibility of this prior condition[ ,] or the [other]
    with all the results for which it paves the way-[a]
     state, be it remembered , little likely to be [ame-]
     liorated or improved , if the child were permitted to
    remain in idleness at home [,] since [it] would be[ still]
    exposed to the same causes of physical [and][ moral]
     depravity. If, indeed, it could be shewn that

      regaining during youth what it had lost during
      infancy, a powerful argument would be afforded
      for government interfering with what the abo-
       litionists of this species of labour do not hesi-
       tate to term infanticide , and compare it to the
      Hindoo Gangetic superstitions , and the Chinese
      systematic child-murder. A perversion of words
       is, however, no argument ; it may be ingenious,
      and serve party purposes , but it leaves the question
       at issue precisely in the same state in which it
      found it.
       There can be no question that a child of nine
      or ten years of age, if it has been placed under cir-
      cumstances to permit the healthy development
      of its organs, is capable of performing light work.
       If a child gets over its fifth year, even when it
      has shewn symptoms of slight scrofulous or
       rachitic affections, it generally pushes forwards ,
      and does well , providing that it is properly nur-
      tured , and is well fed and well clothed .
      A child from an agricultural district [,] eight or nine
      years old , blooming with rosy health[ ,] full of [vitality][,]
       is transported to a crowded town[ :] its parents are

      regaining during youth what it had lost during
      infancy, a powerful argument would be afforded
      for government interfering with what the abo-
      litionists of this species of labour do not hesi-
      tate to term infanticide , and compare it to the
     Hindoo Gangetic superstitions , and the Chinese
      systematic child-murder. A perversion of words
      is, however, no argument ; it may be ingenious,
     and serve party purposes , but it leaves the question
      at issue precisely in the same state in which it
      found it.
       There can be no question that a child of nine
      or ten years of age, if it has been placed under cir-
      cumstances to permit the healthy development
      of its organs , is capable of performing light work .
      If a child gets over its fifth year , even when it
      has shewn symptoms of slight scrofulous or
      rachitic affections, it generally pushes forwards ,
      and does well, providing that it is properly nur-
      tured, and is well fed and well clothed .

    bony fabric having attained already so much
    firmness and completeness of ossification as to
    prevent it from yielding to any very great degree .
    In consequence , however, of the lessened effi-
    ciency of its digestive apparatus , it is much more
     liable to chronic diseases , glandular enlargement,
     irregular developments , at the expense of the
    whole system ; and this train of circumstances is

      in a great measure ossified ; the whole increments
      of its system had been eliminated from a healthy
      source , through a series of vessels equally healthy
     and capable of performing their functions , and a
     degree of growth established , which no subse-
     quent derangement could materially injure or de-
      face . Not so the child whose destiny has fixed
      it here from birth : not only is its muscular system
      flaccid- supplied with thin watery blood ; its
     mucous surfaces unhealthy ; its glandular system
     deranged, but the groundwork upon which these
      are built, the frame upon which they are arranged ,
      is incomplete in comparison . The bony fabric
     has had no opportunity for becoming properly
      solidified-contains as yet too large a proportion
      of cartilaginous matter ; so that the child whose
      early years have been passed in healthy localities,
     and had home-tendance, is far more advantage-
      ously framed for work, and much less liable to the
      yielding of its osseous supports , than the child
      differently circumstanced .
       Factory labour is a species of work, in some
      respects singularly unfitted for children . Cooped
     up in a heated atmosphere , debarred the necessary
      exercise , remaining in one position for a series of
     hours , one set or system of muscles alone called
      into activity, it cannot be wondered at—that its
      effects are injurious to the physical growth of a
      child . Where the bony system is still imperfect,
     the vertical position it is compelled to retain , in-
      fluences its direction ; the spinal column bends

     beneath the weight of the head , bulges out la-
     terally , or is dragged forward by the weight of
     the parts composing the chest , the pelvis yields
     beneath the opposing pressure downwards , and
     the resistance given by the thigh-bones ; its ca-
     pacity is lessened , sometimes more and sometimes
     less ; the legs curve, and the whole body loses
     height, in consequence of this general yielding
     and bending of its parts. *
      These effects are necessarily produced only in
     instances where ossification has been retarded ;
     and it has been shewn how the conditions of the
     child born and bred up in large towns tend to
     this state. With regard to the general health of
     the child , there is nothing in the labour to which
      it is subjected , which is likely to injure it ; and it
    may be questioned whether cæteris paribus , it
     has not full as good a chance of its health being
     unimpaired in the mill, as if it were left at home,
     neglected as it inevitably must be . The inhala-
     tion of dust, &c . , the effluvia from oil - steam , with

     age ; work thirteen hours, one hour and a half for meals. I
     very soon discovered that these children, though well fed, and
      well clothed, and well lodged, and very great care taken of
     them when out of the mills , their growth and their mind were
     very materially injured, by being employed at these ages within
     the cotton-mills for eleven and a half hours per day. It is
      true that these children , in consequence of being well fed, well
      clothed, and well lodged , looked fresh to a superficial observer
     -healthy in their countenances ; yet their limbs were very
      generally deformed, and their growth was stunted ."—Evidence

     which the atmosphere of the rooms is infected ,
     are in no other way injurious , than by shewing that
      ventilation is imperfect : of themselves they have
     no ill effects upon health , provided the consump-
      tion of the oxygen of the respired air is replaced
     by sufficient portions of fresh air. Odours , how-
     ever disgusting-nuisances though they be-and
     though upon those unaccustomed to their fœtor, *
     they produce squeamishness, and a temporary in-
      disposition for taking food-experience has proved
     are by no means deleterious . On the contrary,
     there are certain gases , which would appear to be
     even conducive to human health, though sufficiently
      disgusting . Soap - boilers, chandlers , stable-men ,
      dealers in oil, curriers , tanners , are generally heal-
     thy men ; and to some extent have appeared to
     enjoy an immunity from contagious diseases .
     Neither is the dust in the carding-rooms of cotton-
      mills so great as to produce any marked effect
     upon health. The temperature in which the in-
      fant portion of factory labourers work, is not so
      * To prove that odours are not of themselves injurious to
      health, it may be remarked, that the oyster fishing affords as
      striking an example as can perhaps be found bearing upon the
      subject : " It is a curious fact that these numerous couttôs (or
      heaps), each containing an enormous mass of oysters, all putrefy
      together on a narrow extent of soil , and emit the most detestable
      odours ; yet the health of the precarious and crowded popula-
      tion gathered there is in no ways affected. During two conse-
      cutive years," says M. de Noè, " that I did duty at the fishery,
      I never saw a soldier of my regiment sick : Europeans and
      Sepoys all equally enjoyed good health."-Memoires relatifs
     à l'Expedition Anglaise de l'Inde en Egypte.

    high as to be actively pernicious , except in the
     first instance ; nor does it extend beyond a certain
    point. When a child is first introduced into the
     mill, its temperature often produces a slight fever :
     this , however, does not go so far as to prevent the
     child working ; neither is it at all contagious , but
     is simply the effect of temperature , and is pre-
    ceded by considerable perspiration whilst it is at
    work. This of course produces some degree of
     debility and a paleness of skin , rarely recovered
    from ; but the health does not continue to suffer
    from this cause ; use soon reconciles the consti-
     tution to it. The mischief is , that in this climate ,
    during certain seasons , it is difficult to keep up an
    increased temperature , without prejudicially in-
     terfering with ventilation ; for when great num-
     bers of individuals are congregated together, that
     portion of the atmosphere which is essential to
     life is rapidly absorbed , and a gas evolved fatal to
    animal existence. The proportion in which a room
    may be impregnated with this , although it may
    have no very visible immediate effects , yet it
     lowers the powers of life , and depresses the action
     of the heart, and so far aids the physical declension
    under which the child already suffers . * Great
    numbers of mills have however been examined , in
    which these disadvantages are in a great measure
    done away with, by a system of ventilation and
     cleanliness , as far as it is possible to attain , com-
     patible with the nature of the operations carried
                * Vide Chapter IX.

    on in them ; and where the amount of mischief
    resulting from the inhalation of floating particles ,
    or of deoxygenated air, is so small , as to be worthy
    of little notice . *
     Nothing appearing then in the condition of the
    labour to which children are subjected , of an ac-
    tive or positively injurious character, as far as phy-
    sical health is concerned , the evils , if any, have
    their origin in causes foreign to it,-and these are ,
     first, its continuance, and secondly, the preven-
    tion of all recreation and exercise necessary for
    sustaining or repairing their already shattered con-
    stitutions and to these must be added , the moral
    effects of example, of independent earning and
    appropriation of wages, the evils of which have
    already been detailed .
     The continuance of the labour for so many hours ,
    is the one great physical agent for keeping up and
    increasing the inconveniences resulting from de-
    praved nutrition . The whole burden , however,
    must not therefore be thrown upon factory labour ;
    one half the mischief is done long before the
    child is engaged in it, and even where the period
    which it was engaged , deferred ; the home and
    habits, of which it is the victim , are not those ma-
    terially to assist in its regeneration .
      * Nothing can more strongly mark the puerility which so
     often disgraces the opinions of scientific men, than the stress
    which has been laid upon the importance of a certain number
     of cubic feet of space being devoted to each individual in mills.
    The space, (generally about 1200 feet, ) is more than enough, if
     ventilation is well performed, and is ridiculously small if this
     is imperfect.

    To avoid misconstruction, it is highly necessary
    that the state of the child, preparatory to its being
    brought into the mill , should be correctly under-
    stood . To call out a number of children , and ex-
    amine into their moral and bodily conditions , and
    to charge the whole of whatever is found bad
    in both or in either , upon the mill , directly (how-
    ever truly, it may be charged with it remotely),
    would be manifestly unjust . " Suum cuique tri-
    buito," should be strictly observed ; the evils are
    enough without adding any thing beyond what
    fairly and properly belong to it.
     It is beyond all question then, for it is abun
    dantly proved by physiological and pathological con-
    siderations, that factory labour, continued for
    twelve or fourteen hours, is liable to produce cer-
    tain distortions of the bony system , in conse-
    quence of the previous want of healthy growth ;
    that it prevents proper and natural exercise ; and
    that, in conjunction with a continuance of imperfect
    nurture, and want of domestic comforts , it keeps up
    an unhealthy condition of the digestive organs-
    leading or making the body peculiarly prone to take
    on a variety of chronic diseases , such as scrofula
    in all its protean forms , diseased joints , enlarged
    glands , &c .; and that it checks growth , partly by
    impairing the necessary supplies, and partly by
    positively lowering the height of the body.*
      * The opinion of Dr. Baillie, one of the most enlightened
    and judicious physicians who have adorned the annals of British
     medicine, is coincident with the actual conditions as described

      An inspection and admeasurement of 2000
      children, taken indiscriminately from several large
      establishments , strikingly verified the accuracy of
     the foregoing results , deduced from reasoning upon
     the known functions and operations of the body
      in a state of health and disease . The children
     were stunted, pale , flesh soft and flabby ; many
     with limbs bent, in most the arch of the foot
      flattened ; several pigeon chested , and with cur-
      vatures in the spinal column ; one hundred and
      forty had tender eyes , in a great majority the
     bowels were said to be irregular, diarrhoea often
      existing, and ninety shewed decided marks of
     having survived severe rachitic affections.
      The female, from certain specific causes , is the
     one upon whom these bendings and curvatures are
      likely to produce the most serious consequences .
     The arch of the pelvis becomes contracted or
     made irregular in its outline ; -the spinal column ;
     when curvatures take place low down , encroaches
      above, and is the more valuable, as having been entirely drawn
      from the general operations of the animal economy.

      " I cannot," he says, say much from experience, but I can
        what appears to me likely to arise out of so much labour
      from general principles of the animal economy. I should say,
      in the first place, that the growth of those children would be
      stunted-that they would not arrive so rapidly at their full
      growth- that they would not have the same degree of general
      strength- that it is probable their digestion would not be so
      vigorous as in children who are more in the open air, and less
       confined to labour ; and that they would probably be more
       liable to glandular swellings than children who are bred dif-
       ferently."-Evidence before Committee.

   on its dimensions , or forms such projections as
    effectually to block it up . To the natural diffi-
    culties and pains of parturition are thus super-
   added obstacles , not unfrequently fatal to the
    child , and in all cases exceedingly perilous to the
    mother, leading to the annual sacrifice of many
    lives, and an amount of human misery not con-
    ceivable by any one , but those whose avocations
    have led them to witness degrees of torture ,
   which humanity shudders to contemplate .
    The employment of children in manufactories
    ought not to be looked upon as an evil , till the
    present moral and domestic habits of the popula-
    tion are completely re- organised . So long as
   home education is not found for them , and they
    are left to live as savages , they are to some extent
    better situated when engaged in light labour , and
    the labour generally is light which falls to their
    share . The duration of mill labour , from the na-
    tural state of the body during growth , and from
    its previous want of healthy development, is too
      " The labour in these mills is not perpetual labour, it is
     attention. The employment is not at all laborious— it is more a
    matter of attention than of labour."-Evidence before Com-
     mittee.
    " In those manufactories in which the time [ of work is not
    very long- where the children are not taken in at a very early
    age, and where the proprietors are men of enlarged minds, and
    possess some degree of benevolence , to induce them to look
     after the welfare of those from whom they derive their support
    and their wealth , the children are perhaps better off than in
    many other situations." -Evidence before Committee.

     long, and masters would do well not to wait for
     legislation on the subject, but to dismiss their
     junior hands after eight or ten hours' labour , or it
     would be still better that they should not com-
     mence till eight o'clock , and should terminate at
     six in the evening.
      There can be no question but that very con-
     siderable practical difficulties lie in the way of
     any extensive change as to the hours of labour, --
      difficulties , too , equally on the part of the masters
     and the men . It is doubtful if any legislative in-
     terference can be effective ; but on the other hand ,
     whether it may not most materially injure the
     future prospects of the labourers , and accelerate
     a fate already too rapidly approaching them .
      Still some modifications might be made to satisfy
     the claims of nature and humanity, contradistin-
     guishing these from fanaticism and bigoted igno-
     rance .
       It can admit of little dispute , that by diminish-
     ing the length of time which the factory child
    now spends in the mill , some advantages would
     be gained by it physically ; or , that the same
     advantages might be to some extent derived from
     periods of relaxation during the day. As it is ,
     the perpetual necessity for attention , prevents
     any thing like bodily repose , so that, although no
     labour, in the common meaning of the word , is
     undergone, great exhaustion necessarily results .
     If any regulations , tending to do away with some
     of the evils attendant upon it, were introduced ,

   and generally acted upon, it may be safely
    asserted, that the man who would abolish child-
    labour in large towns, does not understand the
    position in which children are there placed : or, if
    he does, he suffers himself to be led away by
    false notions of philanthrophy, and is no friend to
    the best interests of his species . The interior
    economy of mills has been so much improved, as
    to remove most of the obnoxious agents , which
    fell with such dreadful severity upon the parish
    apprentices, who first became their victims ; and
    there is nothing whatever in a well regulated mill ,
    directly injurious to life , -save only, the length of
    time spent there and its consequences . The real
    evil lies in the habits of the people themselves-
    habits, it is very true , generated by the system
    of factory labour , but decidedly not of necessity
    dependant upon it ; and one half the mischiefs
    suffered by the children , are inflicted upon them
    prior to their commencing work.
     The influence of infant labour upon the mental
    faculties, is a subject of less importance than is
    generally imagined . The children employed
    in mills , exhibit the peculiar intellectual traits
    which distinguish the town child from that of a
    rural district . They are acute and of quick intel- - .
    ligence ; a circumstance arising from the greater
    variety of objects brought under their notice early
    in life , and to their being left to their own re-
    sources . It is not, indeed, improbable , that the
    exclusive attention which is required to one par-

     ticular employment, may, in some degree, limit
    and confine the general capacity for acquiring
     diversified knowledge . This is, however, by no
    means proved to be the case ; neither if it were ,
     would it signify much, as this is a species of
     knowledge , which would not add to their indivi-
     dual happiness .

     WHATEVER opinion may be held as to the
    conditions of society, whether its physical condi-
    tion is dependant upon its morality , or its morality
    dependant upon its physical condition , observation
    teaches that debasement in the character of the
    one , invariably leads to a corresponding declen-
    sion in that of the other ; that if a labouring
    community is forced into a state of pauperism , or

     one bordering upon it, morals, unless under cir-
     cumstances as yet never seen , relax ; and if, on
     the other hand , morals are from various causes
     neglected , the comfort and happiness of the mass
     are deteriorated in equal ratio .
      The moral condition ofthe labouring population ,
     in the manufacturing districts , is in itself deplo-
     rable ; neither is the physical condition less so .
     Whether mutual reaction adds to their separate
     miseries, or whether each has its distinct and
     separate causes of misery, a little reflection
     will easily determine . If it were possible to
     amend the social and domestic habits-to produce
     cleanliness , attention to diet, proper clothing , and
     the decencies of common life , it is quite obvious
     that a vast improvement would at once take place
     in its physical comforts, and in its health . If
      it were also possible to amend the moral habits ,
     to induce men and women to perform their rela-
     tive duties , as wives, parents, and children- to
     make them religious , sober, provident, and eco-
     nomical , it is equally obvious also , that the same
     results would be produced .
       Political economists have exercised their inge-
     nuity in devising schemes and fables, and then
     have looked abroad , and endeavoured to explain
     the existing state of things, in accordance with
     their preconceived fancies . No wonder can be
      felt that tissues ofabsurdities should have usurped
     the place of common sense and observation.
     Clever and talented as some of these are , it is

     lamentable that they should pin their faith upon
     visionary conceptions, and confuse themselves
     and their readers with learned disquisitions upon
     population, national wealth , &c . , &c . , which have
     nothing whatever to do with the subject which is
     alone important to the well-being of a nation :-
     viz., the happiness , comfort and content, of each
     individual family, composing an integral portion of
     its strength and durability.
      These mistaken views might be suffered to
    amuse those who are disposed to read them[,][ did]
    they aim at nothing higher [;] but when they [are]
    made the basis for arrangements intended [to] [bene-]
     fit and regenerate a moiety of the community[,]
    they present themselves in a more formidable
     point of view ; and , by thrusting themselves [upon]
    the notice of men actually acquainted with the
     causes , conditions, and wants of this moiety[,][ they]
    deserve something beyond mere neglect[.]
     The first step to be made is to improve the
    moral condition of the labouring population-
    without this nothing can avail it . It is in vain to
    expect that it will be made happier- that it will
     raise itself from the state of barbarous living into
    which it has sunk , without rousing into action its
    social and domestic affections . It is in vain to
    enable it to create wealth , which it cannot enjoy—
    in vain to tell it that it increases too rapidly , and
    to advise it to adopt " preventive checks ." Its
    passions and instincts laugh to scorn such puerile

     soning the sources of domestic chastity. It is
     vain to tell it the scientific meaning words- to
     teach it to brew, or bake , or build, upon the
     most approved principles . This will not help it,
     for it is neither a philologist , a brewer, baker, or
     builder . It would be just as wise to write books
     for the Indian , whose habits are part of his nature ,
    who knows not nor cares for creeds or formulæ ,
     but who builds his faith in pleasure , animal in-
     dulgence, and selfishness . No : if benefit must
     be derived from this instruction , it must be pre-
     ceded by teaching him his social duties , weaning
     him from his present course of life, and pointing
     out to him that he may be made happier by these
        -
     means, but the attempt to do this by mere intel-
     lectual tuition is alike futile and absurd .
      The health and physical condition of the manu-
     facturing population have their origin in, and are
     dependant in a great degree upon the perversion
     of their moral and social habits . They earn
     wages, which, with proper economy and fore-
     thought, would enable them to live comfortably,
     nay, in comparative luxury ; as it is, they are in
     most of their domestic relations upon a level with
     the savage . Their reduction to this state of social
     debasement has been aided by certain mal-admi-
     nistrations of some laws, themselves of doubtful
     efficacy, in addition to their own singular de-
     pravity. The poor laws and bastardy laws have
     unquestionably acted , and are still acting, as pre-
     miums for immorality and idleness . This is pro-

    duced , on the one hand, by rendering the poor
    man improvident, by furnishing a fund upon
    which he can retire ; and , on the other, by de-
    stroying the chastity of the female , and thus
    ruining all those ennobling associations which
    should mark the intercourse between the sexes,
    and desecrating the most holy of all human engage-
    ments- that of marriage . That these evils are
    attributable full as much to a want of proper ad-
    ministration as to the inherent defects of these
    laws , cannot perhaps be denied ; but laws which
    open a door so wide and tempting to profligacy
    and improvidence , must most assuredly be want-
    ing in some of the proper attributes of legislative
    enactments . All reasoning à priori is done away
    with , and the evils of these measures is rendered
    abundantly apparent by the report of the " Poor
    Laws' Commission ." To those individuals who had
    had opportunities of scrutinizing their operations ,
    the evidence thus afforded was not necessary ;
    but to men in high places , to political economists ,
    who have hitherto been in utter ignorance of these
    things , a salutary lesson will surely be taught,
    and laws founded upon imaginary or illusory ad-
    vantages will give place to arrangements based
    upon clear and decided knowledge-a knowledge
    acquired by practical and extended observation
    of things as they are.

      ject, is very strikingly shewn by one circumstance ..
     Mr. M'Culloch , and other writers of his school ,
     from observing the improvement in the value of
     human life, and coupling this with its known rate
     of increase , have come to the conclusion that the
     health and comfort of the people at large must
     have materially improved. Joining this fact to a
      consideration of the change which has been going
     on in the occupation of the people , namely, their
     rapid conversion into manufacturers ,—a conver-
      sion so rapid and extensive, that whilst the entire
     population has increased from 1801 to 1831 rather
     more than 50 per cent ., in the manufacturing
     towns and districts this increase has advanced 140
     per cent . ,-they suppose that the increased longe-
      vity of the whole must indicate that manufactures
      are decidedly healthy,--- notwithstanding since
     steam became the moving power, they were of
      necessity confined to particular localities for the
     convenience of fuel , and crowded into towns and
     populous districts for a supply of hands . *
      According to Mr. M'Culloch, the average rate
     of mortality in 1780 was 1 in 40 ; 1810 , 1 in 53 ;
     1820, 1 in 57 ; and , it may be added , in 1833 ,
     in 60.
      Mr. Finlayson's calculations enabled Sir G.
     Blane to draw up the following table , which shews
     very distinctly the comparative mortality at two
     distant periods. These calculations , it must never

    much simplified and become more rational- but
    has been in a great degree produced by the alter-
    ation which has been gradually going on in the
    habits of the people, and their modes of living .
    The rush-covered floor, generally unflagged , a re-
    ceptacle for the filth of weeks-the animal diet,
    the ale drinking, the popular sports and seasonal
     celebrations, each in their way induced a state of
    health unfavourable to longevity. The narrow
    and crowded streets , the small and low rooms ,
    with their contracted windows and thick walls ,
    nearly dark and badly ventilated , the want of pro-
    per drainage, and half occupation were all predis-
     posing causes for the generation or propagation of
    mischievous contagions. War, famine , want of
    medical aid amongst the poor, were other abun-
    dant sources of destruction.
      Notwithstanding these drawbacks , the popula-
     tion of Great Britain enjoyed much better health
    than it does at the present period , and this too[,][ not-]
    withstanding the diminished rate of mortality .
    Taken as individuals , they were more robust ,
     fuller of organic activity , enjoyed in much higher
    degree , the feelings of existence ; but, in conse-
    quence, their diseases were of a much more acute
     character, and infinitely more fatal in their
    tendency .
      Health may be defined that condition of the
    body, in which all its functions or operations go
    on without exciting uneasiness . Nature no doubt

     -that is , that every thing connected with the
    taking of food , and its necessary changes, consti-
    tuting nutrition , and every thing connected with
    sensation- the link which binds man to the mate-
    rial world around him- should be a source of
    pleasurable feelings , or, at all events, that it
    should be unattended by pain ; were it other-
    ways, mankind would be stretched upon the rack
    of its own sensibilities. Whatever produces an
    opposite state of things , must be looked upon as
    causative of disease , or that condition of body , in
    which some of its functions are so far deranged
    as to interfere with personal comfort , inducing
    uneasiness or pain , or proceeding farther, and
    deranging and disordering the action of parts , so
    as to interfere with the operations essential to
     life, and , in the end , producing its extinction .

    female children are held , and the want of remedial
    means of even doubtful efficacy, destroy vast
    numbers shortly after birth . A great deal is often
     said as to the hardihood of the Indian mother , and
    the vigorous nature of her offspring , evidenced by
    her easy delivery generally unassisted and uncared
     for, and from the circumstance of her slinging
    her infant on her back , and almost immediately
    joining the march, or pursuing her household or
     field labour. But if a list of children who perish
    from want of proper attention could be obtained ,
     it would present a frightful picture of infantile
     mortality . * The habits of women in civilized
    countries, are repugnant to the simple forms of
    savage life ; and in most cases , the infant is ten- 7
    derly nurtured , and , in consequence , vast numbers
     are reared , which , under a different regime, must
    have inevitably perished ; and this is one very
    important item in the account of the comparative
     mortality in the two conditions . Again , the adult
    male population in savage nations, is seldom
     at peace- war being the maximum of their ani-
    mal existence and happiness. This is especially
    destructive, by cutting off in their prime the
    very flower of the men , and laying the remainder
     of the tribe open to exterminating aggression . It
     is , indeed, rare to find an adult labouring under

    sickness ; nine-tenths being carried off either by
    war or accidents in the chase, or falling victims to
    acute inflammatory disease. Famine is another
    powerful agent in the destruction of tribes, whose
    existence depends chiefly upon the produce of
    hunting or fishing, or upon the imperfect cultivation
    of a very limited portion of ground ; and this
    again exposes them to contagious or epidemic
    diseases, which often sweep away a whole people.
   The rate of health is , however, high, and their
    bodily vigour well known to all inquirers , fre-
    quently, indeed , presenting splendid examples of
    almost animal perfection.
     The condition of man in a state of [civilization] [,]
    differs of course very widely[,] in some of [these]
    particulars . He is better lodged , better clothed [,]
    and exposed to fewer and less important [varia-]
    tions. The agricultural districts [,] where labour [is]
    moderate and food abundant and nutritious[ ,] the
    labourer has , in many points , a bodily constitu-
    tion closely resembling that of the savage [.] He
    possesses great physical development, high
    health , uninfluenced by intellectual irritability[ ,] and
    is, consequently, open to the attack of acute[ dis-]
    eases , which soon destroy him, when brought
    under their influence. Fevers , inflammations in im-
    portant viscera, resulting from deranged [circulation]
    in a system of blood -vessels, gorged with [nutritive]
    fluids , are rapidly fatal, without the most prompt
    and energetic measures for their relief[,] and which
    he is usually unfavourably placed [for] [obtaining][.]

     An examinationY of7 the lists of patients of4 a
      country practitioner, in a district exclusively
      agricultural, will verify the correctness of these
      observations ; the majority of deaths resulting
     from inflammation of the chest[,] head [,] and abdomi-
      nal or pelvic viscera , or the consequence of
      accidental violence, and exhibiting very few
      chronic diseases, except the anomalous ones
     amongst females .
      Thus, the state of health is high in [agricultural]
      districts , and amongst savage and semi [-]barbarous
      tribes . It is , indeed , very common to hear indi-
      viduals so circumstanced , declare[,] that they [have]
      never known a day's sickness, or been [plagued]
     with ache or pain , when a rapid disease seizes
     them , and their vigorous health and great [vascular]
      activity become the agents of their [destruction] [,]
       In comparing this state of things with the
      correspondent ones in manufacturing towns and
      districts, a very striking contrast is observed .
     In the former case it may be truly said, that life is
      physical enjoyment, and disease hasty death ; in
      the latter, that life is one long disease, and death
     the result of physical exhaustion .
      The population crowded into the large manu-
      facturing towns , which have sprung into being
      almost with the rapidity of Aladdin's palace, and
     where their growth has preceded all + efficient

    houses , huddled into heaps , undrained , unprovided
    with needful conveniences , badly [ventilated][ ,] and
   crowded with inmates ; the habits of the popula-
    tion itself, its improvidence, its neglect of domestic
    comforts, its indulgence in dram -drinking, its
    general immorality, its thin and innutritious diet[ ;]
   and these, joined to the peculiarity of their labour[,]
    continued unremittingly for twelve or fourteen
    hours, cooped up in a heated atmosphere[,] and
    debarred from the cheering influences of the green
    face of nature, and of fresh air, and, finally ,
    deprived of all recreation* in open and salubrious
    situations—all these are agents for lowering the
    tone of the system, and produce a series of [dis-]
    eases, widely dissimilar from that which has been
    explained as proving so destructive to a population
    placed under opposite conditions.
     In these towns , disease generally [assumes][ a]
    chronic type ; its progress is slow, and often
    interferes but little with the proper functional
    actions which are essential to [life][.] Neither, in
   many instances, does it, of necessity, shorten its
    duration ; but rather, by keeping the standard [of]
    vital energy somewhat below [par][,][ it] [abstracts] [the]
    system from the impression of more [fatal][ affec-]
    tions , which kill by disturbing the circulation .

    sidered. The great majority of these are compati-
   ble with a very extended life ; few are fatal of
   themselves , and still fewer with the aid which[ is]
    liberally afforded them . The acute diseases are
   exceedingly small in number[,] when compared [to]
   the whole ; and this is the more worthy of [notice][,]
   since they are precisely those which are the most
    likely to come under the observation of the [medi-]
    cal officers attached to this admirable [institution][ .]
   It will be remarked that the cases of [dyspepsia][,]
   constipation , and other affections dependant on
   derangement of the digestive apparatus, are more
   than one-third of the entire cases. This most
   distinctly indicates the vast amount of these pe-
   culiar derangements ; for great as their number is
   in this one table, they must have been extreme
   cases to bring them under notice . Another pe-
   culiarity distinguishing the list is, that one-fifth of
   the number is made up of coughs , &c . , while
   scrofula and consumption, in its varied forms , are
   exceedingly limited .
    The number of patients annually receiving ad-
   vice and medical assistance , at the various muni-
   ficent charitable institutions in the metropolis of
   the manufacturing world , * will afford another va-
   luable document to estimate the rate of health en-
   joyed by the community ; all , however, that are
   relieved here, are not of the class of operative ma-
   nufacturers . The number of individuals resort-
   ing to these charities cannot be less than 30,000

      per annum,* an immense proportion out ofa popu-
       lation of 240,000 . There are , in addition to these,
      133 surgeons , 26 physicians , 76 druggists and apo-
       thecaries, making a total of 235 , all and each of
     whom procure a livelihood by ministering to the
      ailments of the different classes of society . Be-
       sides these, there are a host of quacks , at all times
      a flourishing order, sellers of patent medicine to
      a great amount annually ; those too who adhere
      to domestic medicine, and lastly, and by no
      means a small item, the numbers who resort to
      many physicians and younger surgeons for gratui-
      tous advice, perhaps not less than 2000 in the year.
     To this must be also added , the female patients of
      the Lying-in Hospital, amounting, at the present
       period, to 5000 more, who are supplied with me-
       dicine for diseases incident to gestation, accouche-
      ment, and subsequent recovery ; also their infants
        till arrived at a certain age . Taking all these
       together, it may be inferred , very safely, that
       3-4ths of the entire population require medical
       aid annually ; a vast proportion certainly, and in
       all probability greater than what exists in other
       large towns more favourably placed in some
       respects than Manchester.†

     It might be supposed , in looking at this formi-
    dable list of disease , with the number of charities ,
   and the array of medical men devoted to its alle-
    viation , that death would sweep away a great
    proportion of a people possessed of so little phy-
    sical energy ; that, consequently, manufactures ,
    with their necessary crowding together of men in
   towns and mills , would be singularly injurious to
    the average duration of human life . To some ex-
    tent, doubtless , this is so, but a little examination
    will shew the fallacy of judging of this from the
    state of health enjoyed or suffered by commu-
    nities .
    The very imperfect registers of births and
    deaths- so generally complained of in Great Bri-
    tain-exist in full force in the manufacturing dis
    tricts. It is indeed utterly impossible to form
   any estimate even approaching to accuracy as to
    the rate ofmortality in any given amount of popu-
    tion. The increase depends, very materially,
   upon immigration from surrounding neighbour-
     fair one. Taking the population of London at 1,200,000 , in

      ject, is very strikingly shewn by one circumstance ..
     Mr. M'Culloch , and other writers of his school ,
     from observing the improvement in the value of
     human life , and coupling this with its known rate
      of increase, have come to the conclusion that the
      health and comfort of the people at large must
     have materially improved . Joining this fact to a
      consideration of the change which has been going
     on in the occupation of the people , namely, their
      rapid conversion into manufacturers ,-a conver-
      sion so rapid and extensive, that whilst the entire
      population has increased from 1801 to 1831 rather
     more than 50 per cent. , in the manufacturing
     towns and districts this increase has advanced 140
      per cent. ,-they suppose that the increased longe-
      vity ofthe whole must indicate that manufactures
                 -
      are decidedly healthy, notwithstanding since
     steam became the moving power , they were of
      necessity confined to particular localities for the
     convenience of fuel, and crowded into towns and
     populous districts for a supply of hands . *
       According to Mr. M'Culloch , the average rate
      of mortality in 1780 was 1 in 40 ; 1810 , 1 in 53 ;
     1820 , 1 in 57 ; and , it may be added , in 1833 , Į
      in 60.
      Mr. Finlayson's calculations enabled Sir G.
     Blane to draw up the following table, which shews
     very distinctly the comparative mortality at two
      distant periods. These calculations , it must never

     The changes which have taken [place][ in][ the]

     curious , as shewing the progress of manufactures

     pared to that engaged in agriculture, is indicated
     by the fact that, in 1801 , it was calculated as six
      to five, in 1821 , as eight to five, and in 1830, as
     two to one. This transition , for so it must be
      called, is still farther elucidated by the following
      table, drawn up from the report of the Committee
      ofthe House ofCommons, on manufacturers ' em-
     ployments, in July 1830, and from the census of

      The population of Lancashire, which is the
      great centre of the cotton trade, in 1700, was
      166,200 ; in 1750, 297,400 ; in 1801 , 672,731 ; in
      1811 , 828,309 ; in 1821 , 1,052,859 ; in 1831 ,
      1,335,800.
      When the increase is compared with that of an
      agricultural country through the same periods ,
      the disparity will be strikingly seen . Norfolk for
     example, in 1700 , 210,000 ; in 1750 , 215,000 ; in

     344,368 ; in 1831 , 390,000 ; an increase of one
     and three-fourths , whilst Lancashire in the same
      period has added to its population nine fold .

     These details are amply sufficient to shew the
    rapid growth of the population engaged in manu-
    factures when compared with the general increase
    of the inhabitants of the kingdom at large , and
    with that division more immediately connected
    with agriculture. The numerical disproportion
    which is steadily progressing shews very clearly,
   when joined to the diminished rate of mortality
    evidenced by the general increase, that there can
    be nothing in the processes ofmanufacture, neces-
    sarily destructive of human life. On the contrary,
     it may be asserted that the improvement in its
    average duration , is intimately dependant upon
    the conversion of the bulk of the population from
    agriculturists to manufacturers.
     Paradoxical as it may sound, it by no means
    follows that because the duration of life is ex-
    tended, the people are a more salubrious race than
    their forefathers , whose lives averaged hardly
    1,35. It is indeed true, that many of the fatal
    diseases which formerly at certain times nearly
    depopulated whole provinces, are no longer in
    active and extensive operation : plague, sweating
    sickness, petechial fevers, small pox, the scourges
    which during their periodical visitations destroyed
    hundreds of thousands, are themselves gone to
    the " tomb of the Capulets." This salutary
    change has been brought about not by improve-
    ment in the art of medicine-though very great
    and very admirable discoveries have been made,
    and , above all , the treatment of disease has been

     much simplified and become more rational --but
     has been in a great degree produced by the alter-
      ation which has been gradually going on in the
      habits of the people , and their modes of living.
     The rush-covered floor , generally unflagged , a re-
      ceptacle for the filth of weeks-the animal diet,
     the ale drinking, the popular sports and seasonal
      celebrations , each in their way induced a state of
     health unfavourable to longevity. The narrow
     and crowded streets, the small and low rooms ,
     with their contracted windows and thick walls ,
      nearly dark and badly ventilated , the want of pro-
     per drainage , and halfoccupation were all predis-
     posing causes for the generation or propagation of
     mischievous contagions. War, famine, want of
     medical aid amongst the poor, were other abun-
     dant sources of destruction .
       Notwithstanding these drawbacks , the popula-
      tion of Great Britain enjoyed much better health
     than it does at the present period , and this too , not-
     withstanding the diminished rate of mortality.
     Taken as individuals, they were more robust ,
      fuller of organic activity , enjoyed in much higher
     degree, the feelings of existence ; but , in conse-
     quence , their diseases were of a much more acute
      character, and infinitely more fatal in their
     tendency .
       Health may be defined that condition of the
     body, in which all its functions or operations go
     on without exciting uneasiness . Nature no doubt
     meant, that as far as mere existence is concerned

   -that is, that every thing connected with the
    taking of food , and its necessary changes, consti-
    tuting nutrition , and every thing connected with
    sensation- the link which binds man to the mate-
    rial world around him- should be a source of
    pleasurable feelings, or, at all events , that it
    should be unattended by pain ; were it other-
   ways, mankind would be stretched upon the rack
    of its own sensibilities . Whatever produces an
    opposite state of things , must be looked upon as
    causative of disease , or that condition of body , in
    which some of its functions are so far deranged
    as to interfere with personal comfort , inducing
    uneasiness or pain , or proceeding farther, and
    deranging and disordering the action of parts , so
    as to interfere with the operations essential to
    life, and , in the end , producing its extinction .
     The rate of mortality among savage tribes , and
    in states just emerging from barbarism, is univer-
    sally high ; one in thirty, as far as data can be
    collected , being the average. The health of
    individuals composing these tribes or states, is
    nevertheless , according to all travellers , exceedly
    vigorous, and their frame generally robust, indi-
    cated by the great fatigue they are capable of
    enduring, the severe wounds from which they
    rapidly recover, the rarity of chronic diseases
    amongst them, and the few decrepid and prema-
    ture old men , who burden their huts or wigwams .

      female children are held , and the want of remedial
     means of even doubtful efficacy, destroy vast
      numbers shortly after birth . A great deal is often
      said as to the hardihood of the Indian mother, and
      the vigorous nature of her offspring, evidenced by
      her easy delivery generally unassisted and uncared
      for , and from the circumstance of her slinging
      her infant on her back, and almost immediately
      joining the march, or pursuing her household or
      field labour. But if a list of children who perish
      from want of proper attention could be obtained ,
       it would present a frightful picture of infantile
      mortality. The habits of women in civilized
      countries, are repugnant to the simple forms of
      savage life ; and in most cases, the infant is ten-
      derly nurtured , and , in consequence , vast numbers
      are reared , which, under a different regime , must
      have inevitably perished ; and this is one very
      important item in the account of the comparative
      mortality in the two conditions . Again , the adult
      male population in savage nations, is seldom
      at peace- war being the maximum of their ani-
      mal existence and happiness . This is especially
      destructive, by cutting off in their prime the
      very flower of the men , and laying the remainder
      of the tribe open to exterminating aggression . It
       is , indeed, rare to find an adult labouring under

    sickness ; nine - tenths being carried off either by
   war or accidents in the chase, or falling victims to
    acute inflammatory disease. Famine is another
    powerful agent in the destruction of tribes [,] whose
    existence depends chiefly upon the produce of
    hunting or fishing, or upon the imperfect cultivation
    of a very limited portion of ground ; and this
    again exposes them to contagious or epidemic
    diseases, which often sweep away a whole people[.]
   The rate of health is, however, high[,] and their
    bodily vigour well known to all inquirers , fre-
    quently, indeed, presenting splendid examples of
    almost animal perfection.
    The condition of man in a state of [civilization][,]
    differs of course very widely[,] in some [of][ these]
    particulars . He is better lodged, better clothed[ ,]
   and exposed to fewer and less important [varia-]
    tions. The agricultural districts [,] where labour [is]
   moderate and food abundant and nutritious [,][ the]
   labourer has , in many points [,] a bodily[ constitu-]
    tion closely resembling that of the savage[.] He
    possesses great physical development, high
    health , uninfluenced by intellectual [irritability][,][ and]
    is, consequently, open to the attack of acute[ dis-]
    eases , which soon destroy him, when brought
   under their influence . Fevers [,] inflammations [in][ im-]
    portant viscera, resulting from deranged [circulation]
    in a system of blood -vessels [,] gorged with[ nutritive]
    fluids , are rapidly fatal , without the most prompt
    and energetic measures for their relief[,] and which
    he is usually unfavourably placed [for][ obtaining][.]

     An examination of the lists of patients of a
      country practitioner, in a district exclusively
      agricultural, will verify the correctness of these
      observations ; the majority of deaths resulting
      from inflammation of the chest, head , and abdomi-
      nal or pelvic viscera , or the consequence of
      accidental violence , and exhibiting very few
      chronic diseases, except the anomalous ones
      amongst females .
       Thus, the state of health is high in agricultural
       districts, and amongst savage and semi-barbarous
      tribes . It is, indeed, very common to hear indi-
      viduals so circumstanced , declare, that they have
      never known a day's sickness , or been plagued
      with ache or pain , when a rapid disease seizes
      them, and their vigorous health and great vascular
      activity become the agents of their destruction ,
       In comparing this state of things with the
      correspondent ones in manufacturing towns and
       districts, a very striking contrast is observed .
      In the former case it may be truly said, that life is
      physical enjoyment, and disease hasty death ; in
      the latter, that life is one long disease , and death
      the result of physical exhaustion .
       The population crowded into the large manu-
      facturing towns , which have sprung into being
      almost with the rapidity of Aladdin's palace, and

    general immorality, its thin and innutritious diet ;
   and these, joined to the peculiarity of their labour,
    continued unremittingly for twelve or fourteen
    hours, cooped up in a heated atmosphere, and
   debarred from the cheering influences of the green
    face of nature , and of fresh air, and , finally,
   deprived of all recreation * in open and salubrious
    situations—all these are agents for lowering the
   tone of the system, and produce a series of dis-
    eases, widely dissimilar from that which has been
    explained as proving so destructive to a population
    placed under opposite conditions.
     In these towns, disease generally assumes a
    chronic type ; its progress is slow, and often
    interferes but little with the proper functional
    actions which are essential to life. Neither, in
   many instances, does it, of necessity, shorten its
    duration ; but rather, by keeping the standard of
    vital energy somewhat below par, it abstracts the
    system from the impression of more fatal affec-
    tions, which kill by disturbing the circulation .

    5,833 patients, who came under the care of one

    sidered. The great majority of these are compati-
   ble with a very extended life ; few are fatal of
   themselves , and still fewer with the aid which is
    liberally afforded them . The acute diseases are
   exceedingly small in number , when compared to
   the whole ; and this is the more worthy of notice,
   since they are precisely those which are the most
   likely to come under the observation of the medi-
    cal officers attached to this admirable institution .
   It will be remarked that the cases of dyspepsia,
   constipation, and other affections dependant on
   derangement of the digestive apparatus, are more
   than one -third of the entire cases. This most
   distinctly indicates the vast amount of these pe-
   culiar derangements ; for great as their number is
   in this one table, they must have been extreme
   cases to bring them under notice . Another pe-
   culiarity distinguishing the list is, that one-fifth of
   the number is made up of coughs , &c . , while
   scrofula and consumption, in its varied forms, are
   exceedingly limited .
    The number of patients annually receiving ad-
   vice and medical assistance , at the various muni-
   ficent charitable institutions in the metropolis of
   the manufacturing world,* will afford another va-
   luable document to estimate the rate of health en-
   joyed by the community ; all , however, that are
   relieved here, are not of the class of operative ma-
   nufacturers . The number of individuals resort-
   ing to these charities cannot be less than 30,000

      per annum , * an immense proportion out of a popu-
      lation of 240,000 . There are , in addition to these,
      133 surgeons , 26 physicians , 76 druggists and apo-
      thecaries , making a total of 235 , all and each of
     whom procure a livelihood by ministering to the
      ailments of the different classes of society . Be-
      sides these , there are a host ofquacks, at all times
     a flourishing order, sellers of patent medicine to
      a great amount annually ; those too who adhere
      to domestic medicine , and lastly, and by no
     means a small item, the numbers who resort to
     many physicians and younger surgeons for gratui-
      tous advice , perhaps not less than 2000 in the year.
     To this must be also added , the female patients of
      the Lying-in Hospital , amounting , at the present
      period , to 5000 more, who are supplied with me-
      dicine for diseases incident to gestation , accouche-
     ment, and subsequent recovery ; also their infants
       till arrived at a certain age. Taking all these
      together, it may be inferred , very safely, that
      3-4ths of the entire population require medical
      aid annually ; a vast proportion certainly, and in
       all probability greater than what exists in other
      large towns more favourably placed in some
      respects than Manchester.†

      It might be supposed , in looking at this formi-
    dable list of disease, with the number of charities,
    and the array of medical men devoted to its alle-
    viation, that death would sweep away a great
    proportion of a people possessed of so little phy-
    sical energy ; that, consequently, manufactures ,
    with their necessary crowding together of men in
    towns and mills , would be singularly injurious to
    the average duration of human life. To some ex-
    tent, doubtless , this is so , but a little examination
    will shew the fallacy of judging of this from the
    state of health enjoyed or suffered by commu-
    nities .
     The very imperfect registers of births and
    deaths- so generally complained of in Great Bri-
    tain- exist in full force in the manufacturing dis
    tricts . It is indeed utterly impossible to form
    any estimate even approaching to accuracy as to
    the rate of mortality in any given amount of popu-
    tion. The increase depends, very materially,
    upon immigration from surrounding neighbour-
     fair one. Taking the population of London at 1,200,000, in
    1821
     There were Physicians ..174 or 1 to 7,000

    hoods , to which again many of those who die are
    removed for interment . Great numbers of inter-
    ments take place in the towns from the out-town-
    ships, so that the registries which do exist , exhi-
     bit burials only, without any particular specifica-
     tion which can be depended upon . Then as to
     registries of baptisms , as data for births in a par-
     ticular town or locality, these are no guide what-
     ever, looked at generally. A very great propor-
     tion of the baptisms at the established churches,
    where alone any tolerable register is kept, being
    from out districts . The chief difficulty, however,
     lies in the circumstance of the majority of the in-
     habitants engaged in manufactures being dissent-
     ers ; and from the fact, which is much to be
     regretted, that amongst them, as a body, it is out
     of the question to collect satisfactory statistical
     details. Again , immense numbers of the children
    born to parents in the lowest grades of society,
     are never baptized at all , and if these perish, they
     are buried in the free burial grounds without the
     slightest attention to registration . The population
     is an exceedingly fluctuating one , differing widely
     from that in agricultural districts, and presenting
     insuperable obstacles to the collection of accurate
     details. When all these things are taken into
     consideration , it must be quite obvious that with
     so many sources of error in the way of partial ex-
     amination, it will be safer to adhere to the general
     rate of mortality for the whole kingdom , which
     can be ascertained with considerable accuracy ,
     and establish deductions taken from that.

      It has been universally asserted that the rate of
    mortality, in counties largely engaged in manu-
    factures, was much higher than in agricultural
    counties . The following table shews the gene-
    rally received opinion upon this subject .

     This table, which has been selected in conse-
    quence of having been drawn up for a very oppo-
     site purpose , and which gives the extremes ,
    might at once seem decisive as to the question of
    mortality . When fairly explained , its dispropor-
    tionate results will be materially changed .
      In the agricultural counties , as has been before
    remarked, the population is a fixed one , and , ge-
    nerally speaking, one attached to the church , and
    exceedingly scrupulous in every thing relating to
    deaths and baptisms . The following table will
     verify this :-

      Nor is the numerical disproportion all that must
     be borne in mind in carrying on the comparison .
     In the manufacturing counties and towns , the
     dissenters ' congregations are vastly more nume-
     rous than those of the established church, whilst
     in the agricultural counties they are generally very
     small , and placed in remote situations .
      This single fact of the difference existing in
     the religious forms between the agriculturist and
     the manufacturer, will show how much more ac-
     curate are the means of ascertaining the particular
     condition of the one over those ofthe other, and will
     explain one cause why all the tables of mortality
     exhibit so great a preponderance in favour of the
     agriculturist, greatly indeed above what in truth
     belongs to him . It is not denied that the rate of
     mortality is higher in towns and manufactories,
     but the disparity it is asserted is much less than
     is generally conceived . The immigrations which
     are continually going on from the agricultural dis
      tricts to the manufacturing ones , consist of those
     families who would be precisely the parties to
     swell the bill of mortality in their own parishes
    by their poverty, and are little likely to improve
     that of the situation in which they settle them-
     selves . These families are generally those that
     have numerous children, whose parents have no
     means of supporting them by agricultural labour.
     These therefore appear in the lists of births, but
     no further. Again, the extensive immigrations
     into these districts are uniformly driven there by

    want , and often suffer very severe privations
    before they can obtain work , and many of them
    perish in consequence , especially the children ,
    from the change of locality, and hence swell
    enormously the deaths in the towns ; but these
    have nothing to do with the fixed population .
    Farther still, great numbers of these families bring
    with them the older members , who have hitherto
    lived in open and healthy situations, favourable for
    the prolongation of life, but who sink at once be-
    neath the depressing influence of their new
    abodes . When these several drawbacks are
    taken into account, the mean mortality naturally
    incident to manufacturing districts will be consider-
    ably lowered , for it would be a manifest injustice
    to load these with the imputation of a destruction
    which is perfectly foreign to them. But still the
    mortality will not be brought down to that in
    agricultural districts , in which it has been shewn
                                                                  1
    the elements for fatal disease are much more
    rife, and where consequently a rate ofdeath should
    be exhibited according to this mode of viewing
    the question as high , if not higher than in the
    opposite case . This remains to be explained .
     In that portion of this work which has been
    devoted to the examination of the social and do-
    mestic conditions of the manufacturing popula-
    tion, it has been demonstrated how closely in
    some respects these approximate to the modes of
     life in savage * and half civilized states or tribes ;
           * Vide Chapters V. and VI.

     and in a previous portion of the present chapter
       it has been said , that amongst people so situated ,
      one great cause of the excessive contraction in
      the average duration of life , was to be found in
      the number of infants who perished shortly after
      birth , and in the prevalence of infanticide and
      voluntary abortion . Neither is the manufacturing
      population huddled into towns backwards in these
      respects ;--thus adding another feature to their
      similarity to barbarism in its most odious forms .
      It has already been stated that the majority of
      children delivered in Manchester, the offspring of
      the poor, are brought into the world by the aid
      of public charity-that these children are aban-
     doned by their mothers in a few days after birth
      to the care of strangers ; that they are ofnecessity
     badly attended to , badly fed , exposed to cold , or
      are crammed with patent medicines or dosed with
     gin ; and the consequences are that more than
     one-half of all children born to the lower class
      perish before they have completed their fifth year.
     This appears upon the face of the bills of mor-
      tality, and their imperfection has been pointed
     out ; and in this case they only serve as an index
      to the enormous extent of infantile mortality--an
     extent equal if not greater than what exists in the
     most uncivilized nation on the face of the globe .
     This too , when compared with the average num-
     ber of deaths before ten, explains at once one
     reason why the general rate of mortality is so
     high in these situations .

```
     Manufactures have also the inevitable effect of
    bringing men together in masses , and hence the
    districts where they chiefly prevail may be looked
    upon as one vast town ; and this is another cause
    ofthe increase of mortality, and one too which, de
    facto, has nothing to do with the town being a
    manufacturing one. The rate of mortality , as far
    as can be ascertained , is about 1 to 35 to Man-
    chester ; and though this at first sight appears
    excessive, yet, when compared to other great
    towns, it ceases to be remarkable.* In Paris it is
    as 1 to 32 ; in London , 1 to 34 ; in Birmingham ,
    I to 40. In making these calculations , and in
    reasoning upon them , it must never be forgotten
    that , from the rapid growth of the manufacturing
     * From a parliamentary paper, containing a return of the
    number of burials occurring annually in Manchester, from 1821
    to 1830, and returns obtained by the Board of Health, the

     towns , and from the fluctuating and uncertain
      nature of their population, they were built with-
      out the slightest regard to health or convenience ;
     and the account given in Chapter IV . will shew
      in how lamentable a condition Manchester was
      found in 1832 , in every thing having reference to
      the health , decency , or comfort of its inhabitants.
      When these various concurrent causes, adding
      to the mean mortality of manufacturing counties
      and towns, are taken into due consideration , and
      proper weight attached to them , an explanation is
      afforded why, in all tables of increase and de-
      crease of population , these counties always seem
      very unfavourably placed ; but these concurrent
      causes have most clearly nothing whatever to do
      with manufactures as an occupation, and their
      influence upon health and mortality .
      The details in the beginning of this chapter
      have shown, that during the last fifty years the
      entire population has been undergoing a rapid
      conversion from an agricultural to a manufacturing
      character : that in 1800 , it was calculated that
      manufacturers were to agriculturists as 6 to 5 ; in
      1825 , 8 to 5 ; and in 1830 , as 2 to 1 ; that if this
      examination is carried farther back , the tables are
      turned, and agriculturists have the numerical ma-
      jority. Beginning in 1780, they were about equal ;
      1760 , 6 to 5 ; 1740 , 8 to 5 ; 1700 , 2 to 1 ; and so
      on, till the great body of the inhabitants were
      exclusively devoted to agriculture ; that at the
      period when this was the condition of society , the

```

```
    average mortality was fully 1 in 35 ; in 1780 ,
   when manufactures had received their first great
    impulse, 1 in 40 ; in 1810, when the bulk of the
    population was engaged in them , I in 52 ; in 1820,
     1 in 57 ; and in 1830 , 1 in 60. Hence it appears
    that during the transition of employment, the mean
    duration of life has been steadily improving, and
    that at the present time , its value is double to
    what it was in 1700. How manifestly unjust-
   how manifestly absurd, to declare that manufac-
    tures are injurious to human life . On the con-
    trary, it may be said that, was the population a
    fixed one, and one sober and moral in its cha-
    racter, it would shew a rate of mortality infinitely
    superior to that in agricultural counties.
      Life, however, though not necessarily short-
    ened by manufacturing occupation, is stripped of
    a most material portion of that which can alone
    render it delightful-the possesion of health , and
    those who are engaged in it may be said to live
    a protracted life in death .

   women and girls , 10s . to 16s.; and various other
    rates of wages , none below 3s . , are paid to the
    batters , pickers , carders, stretchers , doublers ,
    reelers, makers -up , warpers , winders, & c . , which
   form the complement of workers in the mills , as
    at present constituted . The average rate of
   wages for each individual may be fixed at 10s . per
   week ; this , of course , includes the children , who
   in all instances form a great proportion of the
   hands . This rate of payment is very nearly the
   same as that which was obtained in 1816. The
    usual hours of labour are from five o'clock in the
   morning to seven o'clock in the evening, half an
   hour being allowed for breakfast , one hour for
    dinner, and half an hour in the afternoon . The
   time of labour has also undergone very little
   change during the last twenty- six years .
    With respect to the quantum of bodily labour
   gone through by the operatives ; -generally speak-
   ing it is exceedingly small. The work of spinners.
   and stretchers certainly is laborious at times , and
   from its length , twelve entire hours , it is necessa-
    working hours . A day's wages for these men may, as an
    average, be stated at four shillings. The great drawback is,
    that the demand for their labour is fluctuating and uncertain,
    and at some periods of the year they are in complete idleness.
   The manufacturers employment is invariable.

      rily accompanied by great exhaustion. In these
      processes the hands are hardly an instant at
      rest, except whilst their mules are doffing, in
     which they sometimes assist ; and however hardy
      or robust a man may be, this incessant exertion is
     overpowering. But in all other cases, as in the
      carders , rovers, winders , piecers , weavers , & c. ,
     very little manual labour is required- none, in-
     deed , worth speaking of. The only fatigue suf-
      fered is that brought on by the necessity for
      unintermitting attention-a fatigue more injurious
      to health than that induced by physical exertion ,
      if not excessive .
      The mean temperature in the factories may be
      taken at 70° Fahrenheit. In dressing and finish-
     ing, a much higher temperature is necessary, in
      the present mode of going through these opera-
      tions. It is , however, likely that certain changes
      will be introduced , very shortly, which will very
      considerably modify this . Inquiries amongst the
      dressers have shewn that, as a body, they are by
     no means unhealthy, when their habits are mode-
      rately regular. They earn excellent wages,
      perspire during their work very copiously , and in
      place of supplying this waste by proper food,
      drink largely, a fact quite sufficient to account
      for their occasional illnesses, and general ema-
      ciated appearance . Temperature in itself is in
     no wise injurious to health, provided it is not
      joined with close and imperfectly ventilated situa-
      tions . The difficulty in the mills has always been

   the keeping up the requisite degrees of heat, with
   a free admission of fresh air ; and some years ago
   the system was decidedly noxious . By means of
   steam-pipes traversing the rooms in various direc-
   tions, and giving out certain known quantities of
   heat, the mischief has in a great measure been
   done away with, and in the best regulated mills
   the temperature , though considerable, is in no
   farther degree oppressive or injurious than as its
   relaxing muscular tonicity . Hot climates may
   be, and are healthy, when cleared from vegetable
   undergrowth , and free from swampy soils . Hum-
   boldt and other travellers and observers have exa-
   mined this point quite sufficiently. Heat generates
   miasmata fatal to human life , wherever moisture ,
   joined , as it universally is in tropical countries ,
   with rank vegetation , exists . The littoral districts
   of New Spain , the cedar swamps bordering the
   great South American rivers , the jungles ofAfrica ,
   and of the torrid zone in Asia, bear evidence how
   deadly an influence may be produced by vegeta-
   ble decomposition , &c . &c . Beyond these, how-
   ever, perfect salubrity is quite compatible with a
   very elevated temperature. A wide distinction
   must be here made between animal and vegetable
   decomposition -a distinction little understood ,
   and still less attended to . The gases which are
   evolved during the putrefaction of animal sub-
   stances do not appear, from experience , to be
   fatal to life, but , on the contrary, in some respects,
   and to some extent , seem rather conducive to

      health . In a note which will be found in the
      chapter on Infant Labour , some remarks have been
     made on this subject ; and in illustration , M. de
      Noe's account of the Oyster Fisheries has been
      quoted . Here , although millions of oysters are
      putrefying under a burning sun, in the very midst
      of a dense and promiscuous mass of human beings ,
       filling the atmosphere with a most intolerable
      stench, sickness is hardly known . In the process
      of grinding bones in this country for manure, a
      smell the most dreadfully offensive attends upon
      the operation ; yet the men , who are constantly
      inhaling this odour , are exceedingly healthy .
      Butchers, tripe -men , tanners , candle-makers, &c .
      are all exposed more or less to animal matter, in
      various stages of decomposition ; ostlers , night-
     men, are under similar circumstances , and yet, all
      things considered , are far from being unhealthy .
      Not only this , but many nations devour raven-
      ously putrid meat, and , in our own times , several
      species of animal food are esteemed unfit for the
      table till putrefaction is very considerably ad-
      vanced ; and yet these are considered as whole-
      some articles of diet .
        It is often said that factory labour must be
      exceedingly prejudicial to life , in consequence of
      the crowding together numbers of individuals in
      one room, or one mill , from the effluvia which
      proceed from the bodies of these individuals—
      none of them, probably, very cleanly, and all in a
       state of perspiration , more or less profuse. This

```

-----

```
    opinion is not borne out by facts , where the
    crowding is not extreme . Many prejudiced per-
    sons have drawn a parallel between the factory
   and the Black Hole of Calcutta , and have suffered
    their imaginations to run riot , in colouring a series
    of dismal pictures , similar to that so forcibly and
    graphically described by Mr. Howell. There is no
    similarity in the two cases whatever ; -therefore
    deductions drawn from the one are not applicable
    to the other.
    The consequences of labour carried on for
    twelve hours , without intermission , in a heated
    atmosphere, which slightly accelerates the action
    of the heart, are, that the muscular system be-
   comes languid , and a degree of irritability is pro-
   duced , which is equally exhausting to the func-
    tions of the nervous system, both of which excite
    feelings of great discomfort and depression . Still
    this is not disease . It is true that it is a condition
    closely bordering upon it, but it neither is disease,
    nor would it lead to disease, if the operative had
   a home stored with domestic comforts , which he
    could well afford , and had habits which led him
    to devote all his spare time to their enjoyment.
   What is the fact ? His home itself is a very sty,
   abounding in all the elements for exciting and
    perpetuating disease . In place of seeking, by
    nutritious food and rest, to dissipate his languor
   and exhaustion, he flies for temporary relief to
   the excitement consequent to drinking ardent
    spirits the very mode to add to his other evils ,

     and to develope the seeds of disease lurking
      within him, generated partly by the nature of his
      occupation, and partly by his want of proper
      diet .
      The exhalations from oil, &c . in a heated at-
      mosphere, though sickly in their impressions upon
      strangers , there is no reason to believe are inju-
      rious to health ; probably, indeed , the reverse, as
       it is a well-known fact that oil-men, and oil-
      porters, have enjoyed a singular exemption from
      the attacks of plague , and other epidemic and
      contagious diseases. So far has this been the
      case, that as a protection during the visitation of
      these scourges , it has been recommended to wear
      oiled dresses , or to anoint the body with oil
      several times a day. The copious use of oil for
      the purpose of lessening friction does away with
      the notion, that this going on so extensively in
      mills , between metallic bodies , might give rise to
      a state of atmosphere something , though remotely
      analogous , to that breathed by knife-grinders and
      pointers of needles , and which is exceedingly
      destructive . Every precaution , however, is taken
      to lessen the amount of this friction, which ra-
      pidly destroys the parts upon which it acts , and
      which, without these precautions , would speedily
      ruin the machinery.
       Several writers who have devoted their attention
      to the influence of particular occupations upon
      health, have noticed the effects of inhaling par-
       ticles of solid matter into the bronchi, & c . &c.

```

```
   No question exists, that when an atmosphere is
   surcharged with foreign matter, so finely pul-
    verized as to float easily, the breathing such
   an atmosphere must be more or less injurious .
   The extent of the mischief which will result from
    this , however, must depend very considerably
   upon the nature of the inspired particles . The
   vivid sketch given by Dr. Knight, * has shewn
   very decidedly that all the operations of steel
   grinding and polishing produces a species of
   asthma and phthisis in those engaged in them ,
   which generally proves fatal early in life . The
   researches of Patissier, † in relation to cotton-
   spinners, led him to remark , These workmen
   constantly inhale an atmosphere loaded with
   very fine cotton dust, which excites the bronchi,
   provokes cough , and maintains a perpetual irrita-
   tion in the lungs . They are often obliged to change
   their employment in order to avoid phthisis . "
   Similar observations have been made with regard
   to other branches of trade , such as stone-masons ,
   bakers , furriers , feather-dressers , knitters , flax-
   dressers , &c. & c . In the words of Mr. Thakrah ,
   " The dust largely inhaled in respiration , irritates
   the air tubes , produces at length organic disease
   of its membrane , or of the lungs themselves , and
   often excites the development of tubercles in con-

     stitutions predisposed to consumption ." These
     remarks refer more particularly to the filing[,] &c[.]
     of metals .
      In the production of yarn, the cotton has to go
     through several processes, some of which are at-
     tended by considerable quantities of dust, and
     minute filaments. In the scutching and blowing
     department, especially where coarse and inferior
     cotton is used , spite of every precaution , much dust
      is diffused through the rooms . There are many
     contrivances to lessen this inconvenience , such as
     turning a strong current of air over the blowing
     machine, an aperture being made to permit the
     escape of flue outside- covering the machines
     with woodwork so as to isolate them in some de-
     gree, &c. &c. These succeed to some extent .
     After the first process of cleaning the cotton from
     foreign bodies , it is carried into the card rooms ,
     and is here further cleaned and advanced another
     step towards being converted into yarn . Here
     also, where coarse cotton is employed , there is a
     quantity of dust and filaments thrown off, and it
      is here perhaps that most inconvenience is felt .
    When, however, fine cotton , of the first qualities,
      is used , very little dust arises from it.
      The system of better ventilation and attention
     to cleanliness , which is spreading among the mills,
     have already freed many of them from the greater

   portion of the atmosphere of dust, which, not many
   years ago, rendered it difficult to breathe in those
   divisions in which these first processes were car-
   ried on . A good deal remains to be done , and
   there is no doubt, that, as far as human invention
   can succeed in ridding the mills from dust and
   flue , this will be the case ; for it is advantageous
   to have them as clean, &c . as possible .
    Many hands are of course employed in this la-
   bour-the carding of cotton , &c . , though but few,
   when compared to the entire complement of mill
   labourers : and it is here that, if evils do arise
   from inhalation of foreign particles , they will of
   course be discovered ; for all the subsequent pro-
   cesses , are nearly free from this nuisance. In the
   weaving department nothing of the sort exists.
     There can be no doubt, but that in many in-
   stances this dust, and these cottony particles ,
   lead to slight irritation of the mucous membrane
    lining the bronchi , and produce cough and expec-
   toration ; but it may be questioned whether they
   induce organic disease of the substance of the
   lungs , or even bring on ulceration of the air pas-
   sages, terminating in bronchial consumption ;
   although a disease has been named the " spinners '
    phthisis . It will be remembered, that Dr.
   Knight, in the paper already mentioned , has very
    clearly demonstrated- less by post mortem exa-
    minations , than by symptoms during life cer-
    tainly that the inhaling steel particles, which
   are plentifully evolved during grinding , polishing,

```
     & c . , produces asthma, running into consumption.
     By a parity of reasoning, it has been wished to
      prove, that the cotton- spinner breathing an atmo-
      sphere surcharged with dust , must be a sufferer in
      Jike manner. The comparison is not fair ; and
      the results from it must be viewed with suspicion .
     In the first place , this nuisance exists to any se-
      rious degree only in a few mills , and in the
     working a peculiar kind of material ; and in the
      second, that this dust, where it does exist even
     abundantly, is of a vegetable nature chiefly, and
      free from the irritating qualities of metallic par-
      ticles , which must in general be more or less
      angular , and which cannot undergo any softening,
      before chemical decomposition resolves them into
     new compounds. In these particulars , the dust
      floating in cotton , flax , and silk mills, is widely
      different from that in cutlery workshops, marble
     and stone grinding, &c . , and most assuredly is
     much less prejudicial. That this dust should excite
     a very troublesome irritation to persons who have
     never been exposed to its influence, except during
     the few minutes spent in the mills on a casual
      visit, need excite no surprise : but in the parties
     who have become accustomed to such an atmo-
      sphere, it produces little or no inconvenience .
       Dr. Kay, who advocates the opposite opinion ,
     remarks very correctly, that " in this example as
     in others, is displayed that peculiar law of struc-
      ture, by which it insensibly undergoes changes
     which enable it to endure the presence of a foreign

    or noxious substance , without [suffering][ the][ ordi-]

    ning, suffer little, if at all, from the [foreign][ par-]
     ticles which they inspire during twelve hours in
    the day. The diseases which arise from the cir-
    cumstances which we have described[ ,] are chronic
    and subacute bronchitis. " * This [latter] part of the
    quotation may be questioned as to its accuracy .
    In some few cases indeed , which have been
    brought under medical notice , a species of bron-
     chitis , having a few trifling points of difference [,]
    when compared to the common symptoms of [this]
     affection, have been cited as proofs that they were
    the result of the inhalation of this [dust][.] Symp-
    tomatology is however too uncertain a science
    to be worthy implicit credit , and is deserving
     little consideration when viewed singly, and none
    whatever when its dicta are opposed to the [results]
    ofgeneral observation . These cases differ so little
    from others occurring under circumstances where
     this agent could not have been applied [,] that[ it is]
     quite obvious they are not dependent upon[ it][ ;] but
     rather that cases of common bronchitis have been
    rendered occasionally more obstinate in [their] [cha-]
     racter in consequence of these cottony [particles]
    being brought incessantly into contact with the[ in-]
    flamed and diseased surfaces [.]

       If the inhalation of this dust was, as is asserted
     by these authors , followed by consumption ,
     whether laryngeal or pulmonary, which is on all
     hands acknowledged to be almost uniformly fatal ,
     there would unquestionably be found a higher
      rate of mortality among spinners than among
     weavers , the one being exposed to this inconve-
     nience, the other being nearly if not quite free
     from it . This datum , if it can be correctly ascer-
      tained , will be at once conclusive . Fortunately
     such is the case , as it is given in a return from
     the mill of Mr. Ashton , and is undoubtedly correct.
       In thirteen years , during the first six of which,
     the number of rovers, spinners , piecers, and
      dressers , (that is , those connected with the dustypart
     of the processes) was 100 , and during the last
      seven, above two hundred, only eight deaths oc-
      curred , though the same persons were , with rare
      exceptions , employed during the whole period .
     Supposing these deaths , for the sake of conve-
      nience , to have been nine ,-then by ascribing
      three to the first six years , and six to the last
      seven, the mortality during the former period
     was one in 200, and during the latter, one in 233 .
     The number of weavers (that is, those unconnected
      with the dusty part of the processes) during the first
      six years, was 200, and during the last seven ,
     400 ; and in the body of workmen forty deaths
      occurred in thirteen years . By ascribing thirteen
      of these deaths to the first six years , and twenty-
      seven to the last seven, the mortality during the

```

-----

```
   former period was one in 92 , and during the
    latter, one in 103 . "*
    Thus , then, it appears , that the mortality
   amongst those persons who were removed from
    the supposed noxious agent- dust, was more than
    double , that which occurred among those who
   were exposed to its influence ; and this disparity
    is the more remarkable , when it is considered that
    in the body of spinners , which exhibits such a low
    rate of mortality, a great number of children are
    included from eight to twelve years of age ; —a
    period when many deaths occur ; whilst on the
    contrary , the weavers consist chiefly of young
   men and women from fifteen to twenty-five , a
    decade as little fatal as any in the course of
   human life .
     Nothing can be more conclusive as to the ques-
    tion is the atmosphere which is breathed by the
    factory labourer necessarily injurious to his ex-
    istence , in consequence of its being loaded with
    the débris of cotton ? Public opinion says , yes :
    examination into the fact says , no ; though it may
    be admitted that the catarrhal affections to which
    he is so much exposed , are occasionally aggra-
    vated by this cause .
     Another circumstance supposed to influence
    the salubrity of mill labour is[ ,] that numbers [being]

     and to develope the seeds of disease lurking
      within him, generated partly by the nature of his
      occupation, and partly by his want of proper
      diet .
      The exhalations from oil , &c . in a heated at-
     mosphere, though sickly in their impressions upon
      strangers , there is no reason to believe are inju-
      rious to health ; probably, indeed , the reverse , as
       it is a well-known fact that oil-men, and oil-
      porters, have enjoyed a singular exemption from
      the attacks of plague, and other epidemic and
      contagious diseases. So far has this been the
      case, that as a protection during the visitation of
      these scourges , it has been recommended to wear
      oiled dresses, or to anoint the body with oil
      several times a day . The copious use of oil for
     the purpose of lessening friction does away with
      the notion, that this going on so extensively in
      mills , between metallic bodies , might give rise to
     a state of atmosphere something , though remotely
      analogous, to that breathed by knife- grinders and
      pointers of needles , and which is exceedingly
      destructive . Every precaution , however, is taken
      to lessen the amount of this friction , which ra-
      pidly destroys the parts upon which it acts , and
     which, without these precautions, would speedily
      ruin the machinery.
       Several writers who have devoted their attention
      to the influence of particular occupations upon
      health , have noticed the effects of inhaling par-
      ticles of solid matter into the bronchi , & c . &c.

   No question exists, that when an atmosphere is
    surcharged with foreign matter, so finely pul-
    verized as to float easily, the breathing such
   an atmosphere must be more or less injurious .
   The extent of the mischief which will result from
    this , however, must depend very considerably
   upon the nature of the inspired particles. The
   vivid sketch given by Dr. Knight, * has shewn
   very decidedly that all the operations of steel
   grinding and polishing produces a species of
   asthma and phthisis in those engaged in them ,
   which generally proves fatal early in life . The
   researches of Patissier, † in relation to cotton-
   spinners, led him to remark , " These workmen
   constantly inhale an atmosphere loaded with
   very fine cotton dust, which excites the bronchi ,
   provokes cough , and maintains a perpetual irrita-
   tion in the lungs . They are often obliged to change
   their employment in order to avoid phthisis . "
   Similar observations have been made with regard
   to other branches of trade , such as stone-masons ,
   bakers , furriers , feather-dressers , knitters , flax-
   dressers , &c. & c . In the words of Mr. Thakrah,
   " The dust largely inhaled in respiration , irritates
   the air tubes, produces at length organic disease
   of its membrane , or of the lungs themselves , and
   often excites the development of tubercles in con-

      stitutions predisposed to consumption ." * These
     remarks refer more particularly to the filing, &c .
     of metals .
      In the production of yarn , the cotton has to go
     through several processes, some of which are at-
     tended by considerable quantities of dust, and
     minute filaments. In the scutching and blowing
     department , especially where coarse and inferior
     cotton is used , spite of every precaution , much dust
      is diffused through the rooms. There are many
      contrivances to lessen this inconvenience, such as
     turning a strong current of air over the blowing
     machine , an aperture being made to permit the
     escape of flue outside- covering the machines
     with woodwork so as to isolate them in some de-
     gree, &c . &c. These succeed to some extent .
     After the first process of cleaning the cotton from
      foreign bodies , it is carried into the card rooms ,
     and is here further cleaned and advanced another
     step towards being converted into yarn . Here
      also, where coarse cotton is employed , there is a
      quantity of dust and filaments thrown off, and it
      is here perhaps that most inconvenience is felt.
     When, however, fine cotton , of the first qualities,
      is used , very little dust arises from it .
      The system of better ventilation and attention
      to cleanliness , which is spreading among the mills ,
     have already freed many of them from the greater

   portion of the atmosphere of dust, which[ ,] not many
   years ago, rendered it difficult to breathe [in] [those]
   divisions in which these first processes were car-
   ried on . A good deal remains to be done[,] and
   there is no doubt, that, as far as human [invention]
   can succeed in ridding the mills from dust [and]
   flue , this will be the case ; for it [is] [advantageous]
   to have them as clean, &c . as possible [.]
      •
    Many hands are of course employed in this la-
   bour-the carding of cotton , & c . , though but few,
   when compared to the entire complement of mill
   labourers and it is here that, if evils do arise
   from inhalation of foreign particles , they will of
   course be discovered ; for all the subsequent pro-
   cesses , are nearly free from this nuisance . In the
   weaving department nothing of the sort exists.
    There can be no doubt, but that in many in-
   stances this dust, and these cottony particles,
   lead to slight irritation of the mucous membrane
   lining the bronchi , and produce cough and expec-
   toration ; but it may be questioned whether they
   induce organic disease of the substance of the
   lungs, or even bring on ulceration of the air pas-
   sages, terminating in bronchial consumption ;
   although a disease has been named the " spinners'
   phthisis . It will be remembered , that Dr.
   Knight, in the paper already mentioned , has very
    clearly demonstrated-less by post mortem exa-
   minations , than by symptoms during life cer-
    tainly that the inhaling steel particles , which
   are plentifully evolved during grinding, polishing ,

     & c . , produces asthma , running into consumption.
    By a parity of reasoning, it has been wished to
     prove, that the cotton-spinner breathing an atmo-
     sphere surcharged with dust , must be a sufferer in
     Jike manner. The comparison is not fair ; and
     the results from it must be viewed with suspicion.
     In the first place , this nuisance exists to any se-
      rious degree only in a few mills, and in the
     working a peculiar kind of material ; and in the
     second , that this dust, where it does exist even
     abundantly, is of a vegetable nature chiefly, and
     free from the irritating qualities of metallic par-
      ticles, which must in general be more or less
     angular, and which cannot undergo any softening,
     before chemical decomposition resolves them into
     new compounds . In these particulars , the dust
     floating in cotton , flax, and silk mills, is widely
      different from that in cutlery workshops , marble
     and stone grinding, &c . , and most assuredly is
    much less prejudicial . That this dust should excite
     a very troublesome irritation to persons who have
     never been exposed to its influence , except during
     the few minutes spent in the mills on a casual
      visit, need excite no surprise : but in the parties
    who have become accustomed to such an atmo-
     sphere, it produces little or no inconvenience.
       Dr. Kay, who advocates the opposite opinion,
     remarks very correctly, that " in this example as
     in others, is displayed that peculiar law of struc-
     ture, by which it insensibly undergoes changes
     which enable it to endure the presence of a foreign

   or noxious substance , without suffering the ordi-
   nary functional derangement ; and a great pro-
   portion of the operatives engaged in cotton spin-
   ning , suffer little , if at all, from the foreign par-
    ticles which they inspire during twelve hours in
   the day. The diseases which arise from the cir-
   cumstances which we have described , are chronic
   and subacute bronchitis . " * This latter part of the
   quotation may be questioned as to its accuracy .
   In some few cases indeed , which have been
   brought under medical notice , a species of bron-
    chitis , having a few trifling points of difference ,
   when compared to the common symptoms of this
    affection, have been cited as proofs that they were
   the result of the inhalation of this dust . Symp-
   tomatology is however too uncertain a science
   to be worthy implicit credit, and is deserving
    little consideration when viewed singly, and none
   whatever when its dicta are opposed to the results
    of general observation . These cases differ so little
   from others occurring under circumstances where
    this agent could not have been applied , that it is
    quite obvious they are not dependent upon it ; but
    rather that cases of common bronchitis have been
    rendered occasionally more obstinate in their cha-
    racter in consequence of these cottony particles
    being brought incessantly into contact with the in-
    flamed and diseased surfaces .

      If the inhalation of this dust was , as is asserted
    by these authors, followed by consumption ,
     whether laryngeal or pulmonary, which is on all
     hands acknowledged to be almost uniformly fatal ,
     there would unquestionably be found a higher
     rate of mortality among spinners than among
     weavers , the one being exposed to this inconve-
     nience , the other being nearly if not quite free
     from it . This datum , if it can be correctly ascer-
     tained, will be at once conclusive . Fortunately
     such is the case, as it is given in a return from
     the mill of Mr. Ashton , and is undoubtedly correct.
      In thirteen years , during the first six of which,
    the number of rovers, spinners, piecers , and
     dressers, (that is , those connected with the dusty part
     of the processes) was 100 , and during the last
     seven, above two hundred , only eight deaths oc-
     curred , though the same persons were , with rare
     exceptions, employed during the whole period .
     Supposing these deaths , for the sake of conve-
     nience , to have been nine , then by ascribing
     three to the first six years , and six to the last
     seven, the mortality during the former period
     was one in 200, and during the latter , one in 233 .
     The number of weavers (that is , those unconnected
     with the dusty part of the processes) during the first
      six years, was 200, and during the last seven ,
     400 ; and in the body of workmen forty deaths
     occurred in thirteen years . By ascribing thirteen
     of these deaths to the first six years, and twenty-
     seven to the last seven, the mortality during the

```

-----

```
    former period was one in 92, and during the
    latter, one in 103 .
     Thus , then , it appears, that the mortality
    amongst those persons who were removed from
    the supposed noxious agent- dust , was more than
    double , that which occurred among those who
    were exposed to its influence ; and this disparity
    is the more remarkable , when it is considered that
    in the body of spinners , which exhibits such a low
    rate of mortality, a great number of children are
    included from eight to twelve years of age ; -a
    period when many deaths occur ; -whilst on the
    contrary, the weavers consist chiefly of young
   men and women from fifteen to twenty-five , a
    decade as little fatal as any in the course of
    human life .
     Nothing can be more conclusive as to the ques-
    tion is the atmosphere which is breathed by the
    factory labourer necessarily injurious to his ex-
    istence , in consequence of its being loaded with
    the débris of cotton ? Public opinion says , yes :
    examination into the fact says, no ; though it may
    be admitted that the catarrhal affections to which
    he is so much exposed , are occasionally aggra-
    vated by this cause .
     Another circumstance supposed to influence
    the salubrity of mill labour is , that numbers being
    congregated into one room ; -by the process of
     respiration , the air being rapidly deoxygenated ,
        * MORAL AND PHYSICAL CONDITION , & c. , p. 104.

```
      is rendered unfit for the purposes of respiration .*
     This point has been already touched upon slightly
     in the chapter on Infant Labour . Wherever
     numbers of human beings are crowded into a
     limited space, the respired air is rapidly freed
     from its oxygen, that portion of its constituent
     parts which alone possesses capabilities for sup-
     porting animal life ;-and its place becomes occu-
     pied by a gas produced by certain chemical
     changes carried on within the lungs, named car-
     bonic acid gas ,-a gas destructive to life , and in-
     capable of supporting flame . This change in the
     nature of the respired air is fatal in two ways , -
     one by removing the oxygen, and the other, by
     substituting the gas just mentioned ; but to be
     injurious in a very marked degree in either of
     these, the place must be confined , and the tempe-
     rature pretty nearly the same with that of the sur-
     rounding atmosphere , -as elevation oftemperature
     produces a continual current of fresh air which it is
     very difficult to shut out, even were this desired .
     Before, however, that degree of saturation with
     this obnoxious gas is reached , which would be
     immediately fatal to animal existence , the atmo-
     sphere of a room may be so far impregnated as to
     produce very depressing effects upon the vital
     activity of the system, which is attended with
    some peculiar consequences , -and these have been
      * This deoxygenation is aided at the present day by the ex-
     tensive use of gas as an illuminating agent.

   well hinted at by Cabanis in conjunction with
   some other circumstances which have been no-
   ticed . " Dans les ateliers clos , surtout dans ceux
   où l'air se renouvelle avec difficulté, les forces
   musculaires diminuent rapidement ; la reproduc-
   tion de la chaleur animale languit ; et les hommes
   de la constitution la plus robust, contractent le
   temperament mobile et capricieux des femmes.
   Ajoutez que, si la nombre des ouvriers est un peu
   considerable , l'alteration progressive de l'air agit
   d'une manière directe et pernicieuse , d'abord sur
    les poumons , dont le sang reçoit son caractère
    vital, et bientôt sur le cerveau lui-même . Ainsi
   donc, sans parler des emanations malfaisantes que
    les matières manufacturées ou celles qu'on emploi
   dans leur preparation exhalent souvent, presque
    toutes circonstances se réunissent pour rendre les
    ateliers également malsains au physique et au
   moral ."
    An atmosphere thus impregnated , acts indeed
   as a slow poison , and produces a particular im-
   pression upon the sensorium, apparently through
   the medium of the blood , which loses its florid
   colour ; and when circulated through the brain in
    this condition , lowers all the powers of life in di-
   rect proportion with the extent of deterioration ;
   and this is one cause of the low degree of vital
   energy possessed by the manufacturing popula-

      tion . In former times , when the [interior] [econo-]
    my of mills was so imperfect[,] and the rooms [were]
     low and small , the baleful influence of [this][ poi-]
      sonous gas operated most powerfully upon [those]
     engaged in them. Latterly, since the great im-
     provement as to ventilation [,] loftiness [of][rooms] [,][ &][c][ .][ ,]
      this influence is decidedly lessened[ ,] but [can][ never]
     be done away with so long as the operatives [are]
      confined for twelve hours , with the short [intervals]
     of absence now allowed them [.]
       This gas, carbonic acid , is heavier than
     common air, * and as fast as it is evolved sinks
     down to the floor, forming a stratum more or less
     dense according to the facilities allowed for its
     escape . It is thus, in some degree, removed from
     the influence of ventilation , as generally managed ,
     namely by apertures or windows placed high in
     the walls of the room . This plan is the best and
     most efficacious for regulating temperature , merely
     as the heated air rising, according to its specific
      gravity, escapes freely from any opening offered
       it, and is replaced by a current of cold air, which
     rushes in to occupy its place. Not so with carbo-
      nic acid gas it remains undulating on the floor ,
      or falls slowly through any casual aperture, or
      A very simple experiment is sufficient to show this-
     " When a jar is perfectly filled with this gas, take another jar
      of smaller size, and place at the bottom of it a lighted taper,
      supported by a stand-then pour the contents of the first men-
      tioned jar into the second as you were pouring water. The
      candle will be instantly extinguished as if it had been im-
      mersed in water.-Dr. Henry's Chemistry, Vol. I., p. 341 .

    flows down the stairs, but very little escapes
    through a common ventilator . The Grotto del
    Cane is a curious example of this , the depth of
    the stratum of gas generally being about two feet .
    Its existence at the bottom of wells , mines , & c . & c. ,
    is another proof of its density being greater than
    that of common atmospheric air , the mine or well
    being quite free from it except within two or three
    yards at the bottom. It may be questioned whe-
    ther the use of cast-iron floors , now so common in
    mills , does not interfere with the dispersion of this
    gas, however advantageous they may be in other
    respects .
     This evil is , however, undergoing a beneficial
   change, from the increased use of machinery requir-
   ing a less number of hands in particular rooms or
    mills, the gradual enlargement of these , &c . and
   might be still more effectually removed by direct-
   ing a current of air along the floors , and leaving
   openings sunk through the walls.
    The transitions from a heated temperature to
   the common day, and vice versâ, especially during
    certain portions of the year, are circumstances
   which inevitably expose the mill labourers to
    colds and catarrhal fevers . This effect is aided
   by their very light and imperfect clothing, often
    issuing from the mill but half- clad and without
   shoes or hat. This might to a great degree be
   remedied by the labourers themselves by a greater
    attention to their personal comforts .
    From this cursory examination of the condi-

```
       tions of factory labour in general , it will be appa-
       rent, there is nothing connected with them neces-
       sarily fatal to life ;-but, that some of the agencies
       to which the labourers are exposed exert a de-
       pressing influence upon their muscular and sen-
       sorial systems ; that there is nothing in the
       structure of the mills, as to temperature- nothing
       in the material upon which they are engaged-
       nothing in the processes , which are, per se, preju-
       dicial . On the contrary , from an extensive in-
       quiry, it appears that the average rate of mortality
      has been and is diminishing since the manufac-
       tures have absorbed such an increased amount
      of population ; but that , although life has been
       benefited , considered as to its duration- yet, that
      the standard of health has been seriously dimi-
       nished . That the former is demonstrably the
       result of lessened vital energy, rendering the hu-
      man system less susceptible of acute fatal dis-
       eases , and that the latter does not arise from
       factory labour simply, -but is owing, first to the
      use of steam , which, by requiring certain local
      advantages , of necessity crowds men into limited
       spaces , a circumstance ever unfavourable to
       health ; secondly, -from the unintermitted atten-
       tion demanded by machinery-a circumstance
      producing great mental and physical exhaustion-
      and thirdly, and this by far the most important,
      from the bad habits of the labourers themselves.
       The diseases of the manufacturing population

   mentioned , and are almost uniformly of a slow
   and very protracted kind . Few amongst the
   population can be said to enjoy perfect health ;
   all are more or less ailing, and are deprived of
   every chance of restoration by the impossibility
   of removing themselves from the malarious in-
   fluence which is ever around and within them .
   This is perhaps the hardest part of their condi-
   tion, and it is a painful object to contemplate
   thousands of human beings toiling day after day ,
   constantly tortured by their own diseased sensa-
   tions , and driven unhappily to seek relief at a
   poisoned fountain , which lulls and stupifies , but
   only renders the mischief more deeply rooted and
   irremediable .
   When speaking of infant labour, the situation
   of the factory child was dilated upon, and it was
   shown to be exposed to every thing which could
   injure its constitution. In reference to this, Mr.
   Green , in his evidence before a Committee of the
   House of Commons, remarks : " [There] is no
   disease to which children , both from the constitu-
   tion of their frames , and the various unfavourable
   circumstances to which they are exposed , are more
   liable than scrofula in all its multitudinous forms .
   To the production of this disease, one of the
   most influential circumstances is , I am persuaded ,
   breathing an impure air ; and by purity of air I
   do not mean any thing that can be determined
   by chemistry : but I refer to the fact that scrofula

-----

```
      chiefly prevails in the children of the inhabitants
      of densely peopled towns and crowded cities .'
        Scrofula may be defined a disease , or rather the
     name for a group ofdiseases , arising from imperfect
      or depraved nutrition, and exhibits itself in a va-
      riety of forms , all evincing that the processes of
      absorption and deposition are going on badly, and
      that the series of vessels devoted to these pur-
      poses is conveying a fluid unfitted for healthy
      growth, the result of imperfect elimination. This
       is a disease to which, à priori, it might be sup-
      posed the manufacturing population , in its younger
      branches, would be very liable ,-- all the conditions
      of their labour , localities , and modes of living ,
      favouring the production of its peculiar diathesis .
      Such , indeed , observation tells is the fact : but
      this by no means so universally as is believed .
      The records of the Royal Infirmary at Manchester ,
      containing a classification and list of diseases , are ,
       in many points, of somewhat doubtful authenticity,
      no regular and systematic plan of registry being
       in use . Independently of surgical operations, con-
      sequent upon accidents , the majority of cases of
      amputation, &c. &c . are from scrofulous diseases
       in the joints and other parts . If a judgment were
      formed from this circumstance alone, it would
      appear that the greater number of patients seeking
       assistance were scrofulous . That a very consi-
       derable portion of these patients , under sixteen
       years of age , is affected by this disease, is perhaps
       true but its effects are not marked as such ; and

```

```
   again , vast numbers of the worst cases which fill
   the wards, are brought from out-districts, ge-
   nerally in the anticipation that some operation
   may be needful . Still , scrofula must be ranked
   as one of the principal scourges of the operative
   manufacturer ; but it exists to an equal extent
   both in the one engaged in factories, and in the
   hand-loom weaver, who , although removed from
   a part of the depressing agencies of the mill-
   spinner or weaver, has to contend with an enemy
    still more destructive- actual want ! In early life ,
   rachitic affections prevail largely ; but this has
   been spoken of in connection with infant labour.
    One of the most frequent ailments , however , is
   derangement in the digestive organs , and this is
   attended by a host of troublesome symptoms , and
   followed by a tissue of mischiefs , which place it
   in advance of all other affections preying upon
   the manufacturing population . The diet of these
   people is innutritious and badly cooked . Their
   habits , their dram-drinking , their undrained houses
   and streets , are all fruitful sources of evil, and tell
   most decidedly upon the functions of the prima
   viæ, altering their secretions, and producing effects
   in the highest degree injurious to bodily health ,
   and reacting very powerfully upon the functions
   of the brain . It may be very safely stated , that
   one half the diseases among adults spring from
    this cause . The food they take is hastily swal
   lowed, almost unmasticated ; it is often coarse ,
   and not very easily digested ; it wants the stimu-

       lants of solidity and proper nutritive qualities ;
      and , pushed into the stomach as it is , does not
       undergo complete chymification ; hence portions
       are forced downwards into the intestines , and
      become so many sources of irritation . The con-
       stant repetition of this disturbs the healthy func-
       tion of the mucous membrane lining the whole of
       these passages. Its secretion is changed , and it
      becomes exceedingly irritable , in some instances
       exciting the muscular coat of the intestines to
       frequent, irregular, and spasmodic action , giving
       rise to griping and cholicky pains , which are
       very distressing. In other examples , an opposite
       state of things is the consequence : the bowels
       are torpid, and many days , and sometimes up-
      wards of a week, pass over and no alvine evacua-
       tion takes place . In both instances the appetite
        fails after a time ; the sufferers lose flesh, become
       pale and languid , and this very often attended by
       hypochondriasis , which increases a hundred fold
       their miseries, aggravating every paroxysm of
       pain to a degree almost unendurable. This mental
      accompaniment is one of the peculiarities of in-
       digestion ; and , in the case of the labouring poor,
      who suffer under it, hurries them to seek relief
       from ardent spirits, which are a very poison when
       systematically or largely swallowed during the
       continuance of these attacks. Little wonder can
      be excited that , harassed by the miserable sensa-
       tions to which this condition of health gives birth ,
       the degraded labourer should have recourse to

    this temporary relief. He either knows not , or
    cares not, that it is injurious , but follows up too
    truly the rest of his improvidences by thinking
    only of to -day ! Medical aid , it is true , is at
    hand, but to seek that he must lose his work , and
    a difficulty might arise as to his resuming it. He
    therefore struggles on till the disease takes a
    favourable turn , or he is so far reduced as to be
    incapable of going to the mill . The singularly
    miserable aspect presented by many of the opera-
    tives , shewing, as it were, an epitome of every-
    thing that melancholy can impress on the human
    face, is owing to these bowel affections . Beyond
    their own immediate seat of disease or derange-
    ment, they call into play a crowd of painful
    feelings , in all parts of the body, and are the
    originators of many of those anomalous diseases
    classed under the general term- nervous, the ma-
    jority of which are dependent upon the chylopoi-
    etic viscera .
     However troublesome this class of diseases may
    be, and it would be impossible to point out any
    maladies attended by a more harassing train of
    consequences , they are not necessarily fatal . The
    extent to which derangements in the digestive
    organs may extend , compatible with life, it is very
    difficult to say not many years have elapsed since
    their importance became understood- a circum-
    stance which may be explained from the change
    in the diet and general habits of society, rendering
    it not improbable that, as an extensive class of dis-

     the bowels . In the higher classes of society, a tribe
     of diseases , having their origin in too nourishing
     and stimulant a diet, which produces a precisely
      similar train of suffering , has attracted consider-
     able attention. It is indeed a new feature in the

     lungs . Still pulmonary consumption does not
     merit consideration , as a peculiar affection among
     the operative manufacturers. Neither does it
     appear that the deaths from this disease are in-
     creasing in any thing like an equal ratio, with the
     increase in the manufacturing population . Coughs
     and asthmatic affections are very prevalent from
     the same causes, but do not necessarily shorten
      life, or lead to organic changes beyond a slight
     thickening of the mucous membrane lining the air
     passages .
     On the whole it may be said that the class of
     manufacturers engaged in mill labour, exhibit but
     few well- defined diseases ; but that nearly the
     entire number are victims to a train of irregular
     morbid actions , chiefly indicated by disturbances
     in the functions of the digestive apparatus , with
     their consequent effects upon the nervous system ;
     producing melancholy , extreme mental irritability
     and great exhaustion , and that few acute maladies
     exist amongst them : that their existence, though
      it is passed in one long disease , does not seem
     shortened ; but that, on the contrary , a general
     improvement in the value of human life is the re-
     sult of the changes which have operated on the
     condition of the labouring community.

     It has been said that " knowledge unemployed
    will preserve us from vice, for vice is but another
    name for ignorance ; but knowledge employed is
    virtue ." This assertion is however so far falla-
    cious , as it assumes that vice exists alone with
    ignorance, and is alone compatible with it. The
    history of all ages and the experience of every
    day life are sufficient proofs that this is a posi-
    tion which cannot be maintained , unless by the
    term knowledge be understood both moral and
    intellectual acquirement, and these, too , so pro-
    portioned and determined , that they maintain an
    equal balance, a nicety of adaptation , difficult to

    point out, and still more difficult to reduce to
    settled rules .
     In this extent however there can be no dispute
    with regard to knowledge . The ignorant man
    will be improvident in proportion to his igno-
    rance, for being unaware of the evils which result
    to him individually , and to the good of society in
    general, he has no check to restrain his irregular
    and inordinate appetites ; the ignorant man ,
    knowing nothing of the resources open to his
    exertions , makes no advance in civilization or
    refinement ; the ignorant man is much under the
    influence of example, and much more easily led
   away from the path of private duty and public
    propriety. The ignorant man , not understanding
    the principles which guide the conduct of the
    legislature , the particular acts of municipal bodies ,
    the relation of master and servant, is conse-
    quently a bad servant and a turbulent citizen ;
    the ignorant man, having no data on which to
    reason, necessarily forms erroneous conclusions
   upon most of the phenomena , whether moral or
    physical, which come under his notice , or he
    remains in stupid apathy, the plaything of acci-
    dent. Education is a word applied to a series of
    acts having for their objects , first , the develop-
   ment and proper direction of man's social in-
    stincts ; this may be termed the education of
    morals and , secondly, the cultivation of mind,
    considered in reference to its peculiar attributes ;
    this may be termed intellectual education .

     The intention of educating the labouring com-
     munity ought to be and no doubt is, to increase
     the individual happiness of every separate mem-
     ber ; to elevate him in the scale of society , and to
    add to the harmony and contentment of the whole
     social union .
      Moral education is that which, by acting upon
     man's feelings and principles, his natural instincts ,
     his duties as a father, son , husband and brother,
     and upon his religious aspirations , has the most
     immediate and direct influence upon his character
     and happiness .
      This is the education which is of the most
     importance to the labouring man . Circumstanced
     as he often is , verging upon positive want, the
     most demoralizing agent upon humanity, he re-
     quires all the aids which can be given to preserve
    him from habitual vice. He is at perpetual war-
     fare with himself, inasmuch as his appetites and
     desires are more varied and more extensive than
     his means and opportunities can satisfy . Hence
      it is that morals as applied to his domestic affec-
     tions and duties are of such mighty importance to
     his well being .
      If the education which is afforded him does not
     aim at these ends , its proposed advantages are illu-
     sory, and its effects may be positively injurious .
     If the poor man's home is not rendered happier
    by it, he is better without it. He had better be
     suffered to remain in ignorance , that other classes
     have certain specific advantages , denied him ,

     whilst he is shewn that he has the capabilities ,
     the physical and political strength to aim at a
    summary mode of changing his condition . If his
     instincts and social affections are not roused and
     determined to their legitimate objects , his comfort
     is only more widely ruined ; for he becomes dis-
     contented with a lot which he inherits as a birth-
     right, and with which he might have struggled
    on through existence, miserable indeed in the
     estimation of the looker-on, but rendered more
     miserable a thousand times by having superadded
     the gnawing sense of his inferiority, which, had
    he been suffered tor emain in his original state of
     obtuse ignorance , would never have disturbed his
     peace.
     Home ever has been and ever will be the
     school for moral education . It is here alone that
    man can develop in their full beauty those affec-
     tions of the heart which are destined to be ,
     through life, the haven to which he may retire
    when driven about and persecuted by the storms
     of fortune. It is here alone he can find refuge ;
      it is here, that he may have about him if his con-
     dition is not supereminently wretched , feelings
    and emotions of the most holy and sacred in-
     fluence ; it is here that he may hold communion
     with himself; and it is here and here, alone, that
    he will be enabled to retain his pride of self, his
     personal respectability. Moral education then is

     inherent sense of justice , to direct his religious

    struction, and the only place in which they can
   be effectively developed is home ; and the way in
   which their primary influence will be perceived ,
    is in increasing the happiness of himself and
   family .
     It may be safely asserted that the means
    hitherto in force , have not been well calculated
    for the attainment of the great purposes of true
    education . The error has lain , and it is one as
   yet but partially and imperfectly acknowledged ,

    Bible ; it is insufficient to teach it mathematics ,
   chemistry, or history ; it is insufficient to teach it a
   language beyond its own . These do nothing to-
   wards teaching its moral duties, and it is upon
   these the excellence of its character and future
    life must depend . As accessories, as a means to an
   end , and as extending the sphere of man's know-
   ledge, these are excellent . As fitting him for im-

     proper light an abstraction from habitual labour .
     and it conduces materially to personal cleanliness .
      On the other hand , it may be questioned if
     means more efficacious , or at all events free from
     some of its evils and inconveniences , might not be
      devised-means that would tell more decisively
     on the character of home, for it is here the root of
     the mischief flourishes in rank luxuriance .
      Sunday schools are not exclusively appropriated
      to the child of the manufacturing labourer ; a very
      considerable portion of their attendants are the
      children of shopkeepers , petty tradesmen, and
      people engaged in various other occupations .
     Here one mischief arises from them : these , which
      of themselves are freed from many of the evils of
      the social condition of their companions , derive
     any thing but benefit from their association , indis-
      criminate as it is . It is here that great improve-
     ment may yet be made in the constitution of these
      schools . As they now stand , the moral good they
      produce on the one hand , is counterpoised by a
      correspondent extent of evil on the other ; and
     when fairly estimated as to their influence on the
     whole community , very serious doubts may be en-
      tertained how far they have aided the moral rege-
      neration , so much needed in these flourishing
      districts .
      Want of due classification may be looked upon
      as one leading error. The selection of teachers
     and monitors , another . Vulgar habits and coarse
      minds should never have a place in the superin-

    tendence of any portion , however minute[,] in these
    schools . Brutality of behaviour , or canting sanc-
    timoniousness , should be alike excluded[ .]
    The number of children who receive the limited
    education in these schools , is very considerable .
    This argues well on the part both of their pro-
    moters , and of those who attend them .
     Mechanic institutions, intended for the [instruc-]
    tion of " children of a [larger] [growth][ ,][ "][ have][ certain]
    advantages and disadvantages [,] similar to [those][ of]
    Sunday schools .
    The mental mprovemient must again be looked
   upon as subordinate to the moral restraint which
    its members voluntarily impose upon themselves .
    If a man spends time , and a limited portion of
    his earnings in the institute, both the one and the
    other must be abstracted from the demands of
   home. But as it so generally happens , that a very
    small amount of the operatives actual earnings
    are devoted to domestic wants and enjoyments , it
    necessarily follows that his money must be spent,
   and his time engaged in the pursuit of debasing
    pleasures, if they can be so called ; viz . in the
    beer-shop , the gin vault, or the political club ; any
    time, or any money, therefore , which a wish for
    instruction may induce him to devote to the in-
    stitution , is one step gained towards a better order
    of things . They are doubtless worthy of every en-
   couragement, but it is far from desirable that they
    should be too exclusively made up of operatives ;
    in fact, the greater number of masters and other

     respectable and superior members there are, the
     better it is for the true advantage ofthese societies .
      There is one circumstance connected with these
     institutions , which those who augured that they
     would effect a complete moral revolution in the
     habits of the artizan must deeply deplore ; and
     this is the gradual divergence which has been
     going on from their original object and intentions.
     Few, indeed , of their numbers are from the class
     they are chiefly intended to benefit .
      The great moral evils which press upon the
     manufacturing population [,] are-[first][,][ those][ causes]
     producing the separation of families[ ,][ and][ the][ con]
     sequent breaking up of all social [ties][ ;][ secondly][,]
     the early introduction of children into the[ mills][ ;]
     and thirdly, the neglect to which the infant
     members of the family are exposed .
      To remedy this last evil-one not less in its
     consequences than the two others in the determi-
     nation of character-a means happily has been
     devised , and partially adopted , which promises
     the best results . Infant schools have been in
     existence for a considerable time in some parts of
     the continent ; but is is chiefly owing to the
     energy and perservance of one man that their in-
       " troduction has been effected into England . Mr.
     Wilderspin, fortunately for the interests of the
      rising generation , is an enthusiast ; and if enthu-
     siasm can ever be amiable , no cause can make it
     more so than the one which he advocates .
     Without this to urge him on , he must have fal-

    tered in his course , checked and ridiculed , as he
    has been, and his proselytes for a time being not
    of a stamp to do him much real service .
     To some degree he has triumphed , but very
    much remains undone ; and were it possible that
    legislative enactments could be brought to bear
    effectually upon such a question , no statesman
    would deserve more nobly of his country, than
    he who would grant such a service to his best and
    most sacred interests .
     Neglected , as the great majority of the infants
    of the factory and hand-loom labourers are by
    their parents throughout the day ; left in charge
    of a mere child , or , what is still worse , a hireling
    nurse ; badly fed , badly clothed , badly treated ;
    their young affections blighted and seared in the
    very bud of their spring-time beauty-the esta-
    blishment of schools , which will partially obviate
    these evils , is a bright spot, a break in the dark
    horizon, closing round their subsequent destiny,
    that is highly animating and encouraging to the
    lover of his species . It is something which, from
     its yet imperfect development, the imagination
    dwells upon with peculiar complacency, promising ,
    as it does , to snatch the innocent victims of a per-
    nicious state of society from a part of the miseries
    incident to it , and to suffer the young blossom to
    expand , partly at least, under the influence of a
    purer atmosphere .
     The error into which these schools have fallen,
    and which, from a want of correct understanding

     as to the noble purposes to which they may be
     directed, and a corresponding want of correct
     knowledge of the moral evils under which their
      little charges labour at home, is the wish and
     endeavour to cultivate too much the intellect
     This is an error, and , still farther, it is an absur-
     dity; for no purpose of real utility can be effected
    by it. The great objects of the promoters and
     superintendents of these infant asylums should
     be, to stand in loco parentis in all those attach-
     ments and moral associations which are inherent
     in young minds, and by so doing, lay the founda-
     tion for a structure which , though it may never
     be finished , and though it may be injured and
     defaced by occurrences to which it will be sub-
     jected , will , nevertheless , still shew itself at points
     like the beautiful proportion of a Greek temple ,
     half buried amidst the ruins of a coarser and later
     period of architecture .
       It is much to be wished that the master manu-
     facturers would rouse themselves universally to
     forward the spread of these admirable institutions
     amongst their hands . They are the only parties
    who can do so effectually ; and no mill owner
     could more worthily perform the duties which
     abstractedly he most certainly owes to those in
      his employ , than by establishing, or aiding in the
     establishing infant schools , which should embrace
     every child , the parents of which were manifestly
     unfitted for its charge, either by moral delin-
     quency , or by being engaged in the factory .

```

```
     Some of these men have , indeed , forwarded
    these institutions, as well as shewing in other points
    a disposition to assist and guide the moral conduct
    of their hands ; their number is , however, ex-
    ceedingly small . It must be hoped that the dis-
    cussions which have arisen concerning the moral
    and physical evils attendant upon the factory
    system, will not be without their influence upon
   them As a class , they have a most extensive
   power of doing good, and as a class they have
    either by direct example or by negligence , ex-
    tensive power ofof doing doing harm harm .. Of one thing they
   may be assured, that by forwarding the interests
   and happiness of the demoralized artizan , they
    will in equal ratio add to their own , and that if
    they continue to neglect or overlook these for
    selfish purposes , they will repent them in bitter-
    ness and anguish .
     The number of children as yet [brought][ under]
    this system, when all things are considered[ ,] is
    full as great as could be expected[ .] Its practical
    advantages want explaining to the parents[ ;] pro-
    bably the provident societies now establishing
    will do something towards this- their [influence]
    cannot be better directed [.]
     The diffusion of correct information on the
   common arts of life , with facts , and moral exam-
    ples, drawn from authentic and pure sources, in
    the shape of very cheap periodicals , will un-
    doubtedly have their influence upon the minds of
    all classes . It is a vast advantage to what may

     be termed the accidental reader and inquirer, to
     have information brought to him at short inter-
      vals , and in an attractive form ,-a thing aimed at
     by all the publications of this class .
       Their diffusion , however, amongst the lower
      orders of the population in manufacturing towns ,
     amounts to nothing. It is true enough that the
     lowness of their price brings them within the
     reach of most of the operatives , and it is equally
      true that most of them can read , but they do not
      purchase the weekly magazines ; the vast num-
     ber sold being taken by the middle classes of
      society. Their place is occupied by sectarian
     and political tracts , which , by their exciting na-
      ture seem to harmonize better with the depraved
      taste existing amongst them . Very little interest
      or curiosity is shewn by this class of the com-
     munity for the generality of subjects discussed
     and illustrated by the weekly periodicals . They
     do not come home sufficiently to their feelings
     and situations - they do not apply themselves
      sufficiently closely to their peculiar passions and
     wants , and they are, in consequence , neglected
     by them .
      The literature which will succeed at present in
      extending itself amongst them , must come down
      to their moral and intellectual level-must take a
     much lower tone , and must be coarser and ruder
      in its details : facts clearly demonstrated by an
      examination of the works which are read and
      ´studied by them . By the neglect of this , they

   have as a body been left to the writings of indivi-
   duals , who have written for some particular pur-
   pose, totally independent of moral cultivation,
   and it is desirable that the field should be now
   occupied by something equally homely, equally
   stirring, but directed to better purposes .
    The results of the various efforts which have
   been made, and which are still making, to edu-
   cate this portion of the community, are ex-
   tensive and surprising , and were intellectual edu-
   cation alone wanting, highly satisfactory. Not
   many years ago, very few of the thousands
   that were congregated in these districts could
   read , and still fewer write . Now, the majority
   can at least read, though writing is still not com-
   mon amongst them ; -the very minute portion of
   time allowed them by the nature of their labour[,]
   must prevent any very great extension beyond
    this . No human being whose time , for twelve to
   sixteen hours per day , is occupied by exertions [for]
   procuring a livelihood , can devote himself to ex-
   tend the sphere of his knowledge beyond some of
    its primary elements ; and to do this they must [be]
   brought to his door, and be offered to him[,] or
   they will never be sought for by him[ .] It is in
   vain to imagine and theorize upon that [disposition]
   of the human mind , which has had its impulses
   once stirred , will seek for information at the sacri-
    fice of needful repose, or the grosser [pleasures] of
   sense . It neither is , nor will it ever be the case
   generally . Isolated examples may indeed be

     found of men struggling through the severest and
     most oppressive difficulties in this pursuit ; but
     they are isolated examples- nothing upon which
      to found data applicable to the mass . Till the
      factory system is revised-till morals are esta-
      blished- till a code of ethics is adopted by them,
     no intellectual education will render them bet-
      ter husbands , better fathers , or better citizens ;
       still it is a step gained- a step which, if followed
     by an attention to their wants by those who have
      the means of alleviating them, may, and it is fer-
      vently hoped will, have the most happy and bene-
      ficial result.
      The little regard paid to religion by the mass of
     the manufacturing population , is a painful cir-
     cumstance connected with their condition. A
      disregard for the common observances of religious
     worship, and the spending the Sabbath in drunk-
      enness , being almost universal in the lowest
      classes . The proportion of these degraded beings,
     who possess no knowledge whatever of the most
      simple portions of Christian faith , is truly astonish-
      ing. Inquiries made amongst them have shewn,
      that often there is no belief in the superintending
      care of a Beneficent Creator- none of a state of
      future rewards or punishments , but that material-
     ism has placed them in these respects upon a level
     with the beasts that perish. In numerous other
     examples, where even some knowledge was found
     on religious subjects , it failed in producing its
      salutary influence upon morals, in consequence of

   apathy and indifference . Thus , deprived of the
   most ennobling characteristic of the human mind ,
  what wonder can be felt that it is wild waste ,
   overgrown with noxious weeds , which choke and
   destroy the seeds of a better harvest, scattered as
   they are so thinly and so rarely over its surface.
  The savage, roaming through his native wilder-
   ness , bows down with reverence before the objects
   he has been taught to worship ; and however
   degraded these are, they are such as his condition
   leads him to fear or to love , and he looks forward
   to the " spirit land " as his place of rest . Thus , he
   is religious in the only way in which his untutored
   mind and limited observation will permit . Thus
   far he is superior to that portion of the operative
   manufacturers which acknowledges no God-
   which worships no image-which regards no here-
   after. The savage, indeed , from his familiarity
   with the operations of nature, in all their wild
   wonders, is impressed with her power, and yields
   obedience to the dictates of a whispering con-
   sciousness that there is- that there must be-a
   cause for all he sees around him. But how differ-
   ently placed is the factory labourer. He knows
   nothing of nature-her very face is hidden and
   obscured from him, and he is surrounded and
   hemmed in by a vast circle of human inventions .
   He is at perpetual warfare with the world and
   with himself, and his bad passions are consequently
   in constant play . Thus combating, the pure and
   holy impulses of religion can find no home with

      him , but , like the dove hanging with trembling
      wing over the agitated waters of the deluge, seek
      a refuge in the ark of some more peaceful bosom ,
      and leave him occupied solely by his own impure
      sensations .
       The immoralities which stain the character of
      the manufacturing population , have been brought
      under review ; these admit of no classification—
      no statistical inquiries can reach them . Vice ,
      licentiousness , and depravity, which are of uni-
      versal extent, can only be pointed out , and their
      operations watched by individuals who are led
      into their haunts , either by curiosity , a desire to
      learn in order to amend , or by professional and
      private duties. Crime , however, open violations
      of the existing laws , which subject the criminal
      to punishment, is more in view, and a tolerably
      accurate account may be given of it.
       As civilization advances , and as countries be-
      become populous , a change takes place in the
      character of crime. In the early ages of society,
     human life was little considered ; and hence ,
       injuries to the person characterize this portion of
       its history. In an opposite state of things , of-
      fences against property chiefly prevail ; blood-
      shed and murder giving way to criminal acts of
      minor enormity ; whilst , at the same time , crimes
      in proportion as they lessen in enormity, become
      numerically greater, and of more universal pre-
      valence .
       The following table, which has been drawn up

   factures, and the consequent concentration of
   the population into large towns . The above

   mercial of all countries pretending to civilization ,
    is , in respect of crime against property, three
   times less vicious than France , and more than
   seven times less vicious than England . This fact
    is a fearful one , and speaks volumes . England is
   more than twice as criminal as France , in this

     of dishonesty or larceny ; while our own country ,
     whose civilization we are so apt to vaunt, far
     exceeds all others in the career of mercenary
     erime, and has increased many years back, and

     the House, it appears , that crime , during the last
     twenty years , has been progressing in much
      greater ratio than the increase of population , but
      that this progression has equally characterized
     the agricultural and manufacturing districts .
      Since the late distress has so widely spread over
     many ofthe agriculturists , there is every reason
     to suppose criminal acts are full as frequent as
     amongst manufacturers . The mass of crime
     which prevails in these situations , originates
     from a variety of causes, totally independent of
      manufactures ; andand the the Author Author just just quoted from
       * « Causes Criminelles Cèlébres, & c. Paris, 1828.

   has mistaken the reason of the dereliction which
   he so correctly describes . The table which he
   gives to illustrate his opinions, will serve another
   purpose just as well . The average amount of
   crime as to population in eight manufacturing
   counties, is 1 to 840. - in the eight agricultural
   counties, 1 to 1,043 ; a disproportion much
    less than might have reasonably been inferred ,
   when it is remembered how differently the
   two situations compared , are circumstanced . In
   the one , there is a thinly - scattered population-
   in the other , densely populous districts , resem-
   bling, in fact, a continued town. In the one an
    abstraction from all opportunities of committing
   petty crimes in the other, a thousand incite-
   ments offer for the commission of larcenies . An
   examination of all towns will show, that they are
   placed in conditions equally as unfavourable as
   Manchester , in this respect. Crime is no more
   common in manufacturing towns and districts ,
   than in other equally populous localities ; and
   when the detail which has been given, as to the
    general immorality pervading this population is
    considered , astonishment should rather be ex-
    cited , that crimes of greater enormity are not of
   more frequent occurrence . That crimes are more
   numerous in towns and great cities , is sufficiently
    well known ; but with regard to England - when
    her agricultural divisions are found having one
    criminal in every 1,044 of their inhabitants ; and
   when her manufacturers exhibit one in 840 , the

       sity liable to the same fluctuations as affect other
      species of capital ; now, from fortuitous circum-
      stances, doubled or trebled in value ; then reduced
      to a like amount, or so far lower, that it ceases to
      be worth the possessors while to employ it .
       Labour being the poor man's sole possession, his
      property deserves an equal portion of legisla-
       tive protection , with property of any other kind ;
      and in return it should be content to be placed
      under the same restraints and regulations , which
      are placed for the benefit of all parties upon other
      kinds of property.
        If in periods of great public distress , the monied
     men of the kingdom were permitted unrestrained
      by legal shackles, to advance at will the rate of in-
       terest, they would quickly absorb the greatest
      portion of the national wealth ; if in times of ma-
      nufacturing depression , the workman was per-
      mitted to raise at will the price of his labour, he
      would quickly absorb the wealth or means of the
      manufacturer. In the one instance the few would
      be enriched at the expence of the many ; in the
      other, the many would be enriched at the expence
      of the few ; but in both instances , it is quite
      clear that the advantages gained would be no
      compensation for the evils which must necessarily
      disorganize society.
       The exchangeable value of labour must at all
      times depend upon many contingencies, just as the
      exchangeable value of the manufactured article
      does. The middle man as the master manu-

```
    facturer may be called , placed between the la-
    bourer on the one hand , and the consumer on the
    other, is necessitated to accommodate both par-
    ties , and to regulate their mutual operations . If
   the labourer must take the arrangement into his
   own hands , he will naturally enough keep up the
    price of his own article- labour. To suppose that
   he will keep this well balanced , so as to enable
   the master manufacturer to make a profit on his
    capital- money ; and the consumer to supply
   himself at a rate , advantageous, when compared
   with other markets , is an absurdity . He will do
   no such thing, he is selfish from his very circum-
   stances and condition , and has besides that, none
   of those general views and extended information
   which are requisite for preserving a just equili-
   brium . He would , in the first place , ruin his mas-
   ter by preventing him fairly competing with his
   neighbours ; he would ruin himself by thus lessen-
   ing the immediate amount of manufacture ; and he
   would ruin his country as a commercial one, by
   disabling it from carrying on its manufacturing
   operations in a way to rival other countries.
    On the other hand the master- manufacturer, if
   permitted to regulate the value of labour, would
   undoubtedly reduce it below its just level. It is
   asserted that the minimum price of labour should
   be that which affords to the labourer a com-
   fortable subsistence . This is unjust upon the
   manufacturer. The value of a man's labour, in
   many instances, is far inferior to what would

```

-----

```
     support him . The proposition would be more
      tenable, were it said, that every member of a
     community who labours in his vocation , and is
      productive as far as circumstances will permit,
     has a claim for support upon the community at
      large , which , in some shape or other, derives
      benefit from him : but to saddle him upon a par-
      ticular portion of the community , would be alike
      unjust and partial. Nothing should be expected
     from the master-manufacturer beyond this- that
     he should not enrich himself at the expense of
      his labourers ; but after securing that which he
     has a right to do a proper return for his outlay
     of capital , risk , and other contingencies , then
      that the surplus should be considered due to the
      labourers , and paid over to them in such a way
      as to interfere the least with their independent
      use of it .
       Experience has long ago taught one lesson :
      that wherever power was possessed by man over
     man , it was liable to abuse , and that some re-
      gulation was essentially necessary to remedy a
      state of things apparently natural to him, in
     whatever state of civilization he is placed . It is
      equally for the benefit of master and men, that
     they should either make these regulations for
      themselves , or should wisely submit to any le-
      gislative enactments intended to save them from
     each other, and from their own partial and unjust
      opinions . *

    There is always a great difficulty in legislating
   for the protection of particular interests , arising
   chiefly from the impossibility of government ac-
   quiring correct information . Each party is alike
   strenuous for their separate interests , and each
   some point of analogy with the feudal institutions prior to the
   reign of Henry VII. , and the system of cottage building,
   &c. &c. threatens to make its resemblance still closer . Com-
    binations of the men, if properly ordered , would have all the
    beneficial influences of the early chartered incorporations, and
   would produce the same effects as these did upon the prosperity
   and independence of the towns and bodies to which they were
   granted. The motives for the granting of these, and the con-
   sequences resulting from them, are pretty clearly pointed out
   by Adam Smith, as follows :-:-" In those days the sovereign of
   perhaps no country in Europe was able to protect through the
   whole extent of his dominions the weaker part of his subjects
   from the oppression of the great lords . Those whom the law
   could not protect, and who were not strong enough to defend
   themselves, were obliged either to have recourse to tho protec-
    tion of some great lord, and in order to obtain it, to become
    either his slaves or vassals, or to enter into a league of mutual
    defence for the protection of one another. The inhabitants of
    cities and burghs, considered as single individuals, had no
   power to defend themselves, but by entering into a league of
   mutual defence with their neighbours. They were capable of
   making no contemptible resistance . The lords despised the
   burghers, whom they considered not only as of a different
    order , but as of a parcel of emancipated slaves , almost of a dif-
    ferent species from themselves. The burghers naturally hated
   and feared the lords. The king, by granting them magistrates
   of their own, the privilege of making bye-laws for their own
   government, that of building walls for their own defence, and
    that of rendering all their inhabitants under a sort of military
    discipline, gave them all the means of security and indepen-
   dency of the barons, which it was in his power to bestow."-

     alike interested in perverting or distorting the
     facts of one another. Could they once be con-
     vinced that their interests are mutual , they would
    be by far the best legislators for themselves ; but
    from the various combinations which exist, and
    from the exasperations of feeling which have
    grown up between them in consequence of these,
     very little hope is left that they will ever cor-
     dially unite in mitigating, on the one hand, the
     condition of the labourer, and , on the other, in
     upholding the just interests of the manufacturer.
     The total want of confidence which at present
    marks the relations of the master-manufacturer
     and his hands , and the feelings of deep hatred
     which are too prevalent amongst them , have
    been brought about chiefly by unadvised com-
     binations on both sides .
       It may be truly stated , that they are inor-
     ganized opposition , in banded societies, for the
     purpose of injuring the interests of each other,
     from a mistaken and groundless hope that sucli
     injury would benefit themselves . It could do no
     such thing : and they only heighten the unavoida-
     ble misfortunes incident upon their separate states,
    by a course of proceeding at variance with every
      rations, says " The good effects of this new institution were
     immediately felt ; and its influence on government, as well as
     manners, was no less extensive than salutary. A great body
     of the people was released from servitude, and from all the
      arbitrary and grievous impositions to which that wretched con-
      dition had subjected them.

   thing just and charitable , and which, by its de-
   moralizing agency, is rapidly unfitting them from
   ever regaining a position , with reference to each
   other, which is alone compatible with their best
   interests .
    Combination is justifiable only when a disposi-
   tion is plainly shewn to take certain advantages
   which may be more or less injurious to either
   party. On the one hand , the master may wish
   and endeavour to exact more work from his
   hands without increasing their wages , and thus
   add to his profits at the expense of their la-
   bour. Here he may find himself thwarted in his
   purpose . His men scatter themselves amongst
   his neighbours , or refuse to work , knowing that
   he cannot afford to let his machinery and stock in
   trade remain idle . Under these circumstances , if
   his neighbours do not embrace his cause , he is
   compelled to take back his hands upon their own
   terms, having possibly to make certain sacrifices ,
   as to mill regulations , as a propitiation . The
   passive combination of the men here gains them
    their object ; and , in this particular instance, per-
   haps the conduct of the individual master might
   be [wrong]. But this triumph by no means leaves
   them in the same relative situation which they
   held before . Their natural order is to some ex-
   tent reversed , and the men have learnt a dan-
   gerous power. Farther still , the character of the
   master is lowered in their estimation ; they have
   no faith in him, and are eternally jangling and

     disputing upon points of discipline . On the other
     hand , this power having once been acknowledged ,
     the men, in their turn , become more unreasona-
     ble, and during a run of trade , or seizing upon
     some other favourable juncture , demand either a
     lessening of the period of labour , or an increased
     rate of payment for that which they already go
     through. The master demurs ; his hands strike ,
     and he finds himself on the very verge of ruin in
     consequence . He holds out if he can ; and the
    men, having their own sufferings to contend with,
     in the end return at their old prices , or an in-
     crease so small, as to be a straw in the balance
     compared to what they have lost during their
     wilful idleness .
       It is quite obvious that occurrences of this nature [,]
     so detrimental to the interests ofthe men on the one
     hand , and the masters on the other[,] must lead[ to][ the]
     adoption of some measures having for [their][ inten-]
     tion the equalization or protection of both [against]
     the caprice, avariciousness , and unreasonable and
     untimely demands. Unfortunately, each party
    made their own arrangements. The men under the
     belief that they were all powerful , and the masters
     in self-defence , with the farther understanding
     that they would assist each other [.] On both sides
     funds were collected , delegates and secretaries
     appointed , and labour and monied capital came
     into direct collision .

    picture not the less awful of rapid demoralization .
   So far have these gone sometimes , as to threaten
   the ruin of an entire and flourishing town or dis-
    trict, and have involved in it not only the interests
    of the two conflicting parties , but the race of shop-
   keepers and others dependent upon them for their
    support. The most extensive emigrations have
   taken place , poor-rates have been doubled , and
    society disorganised . *
    These struggles have uniformly been most dis-
    astrous to the men , and must ever be so . It is in
   vain that in their rage worked up into madness by
    heartless demagogues, by hunger, by the sight of
    their famishing children , they have taken the law
    into their own hands , and dreadful proofs have
   they given how unfit were they to wield it for

    injurious to the parties themselves. As the injury done to the

    + The deliberate assasination of Thomas Ashton, son of Mr.
    S. Ashton, one of the principal cotton manufacturers in the
    neighbourhood of Manchester, during the strike in 1831-32,
    was an act of the most atrocious villainy. Returning from the
    mill early in the evening through a bye-road, he was shot

     lical outrage , all have been perpetrated for inti-
     midation or revenge ; but in all cases with the like
     result , or when partial success has attended them ,
     it has been but temporary.
     The extent to which combinations exist amongst
    workmen is only fully shewn when a general
     strike in a particular branch of trade takes place .
    Then they are seen ramifying in every direc-
     tion, embracing all trades alike , each having their
     separate rules and code of laws, but all uniting
     would have been difficult to have selected- for he was distin-
     guished by his general kindness to the men, and endeared by
      his amiable qualities to his friends. The crime would seem to
     have been perpetrated by three people in company, who had
     been seen lurking about during the early part of the evening.
     Large rewards were offered both by government and his con-
     nexions, but have hitherto had no result, and it seems pro-
     bable that its perpetrators will escape the punishment so richly
     deserved by their act-save the hell of their own consciences—
     or that the strange retributive justice , which has marked similar
      atrocities, will in course of time bring them to light.
       The crime of vitriol throwing is a novel feature in the
     annals of the country. It consists of putting into a wide
     necked bottle a quantity of sulphuric acid- oil of vitriol as it
      is commonly called-and throwing this upon the person of the
     obnoxious individual , being either directed to the face or dress
     merely, or of throwing a quantity upon any work offensive to
     the party. The caustic nature of this fluid renders it a formid-
     able weapon when it is applied to any exposed part of the
     body, and in several instances loss of sight has resulted from it,
     and in a vast number of others very great suffering has resulted
     from its application . It is immediately destructive to the
     texture of cloth from its corrosive qualities. This demoniacal
     proceeding was exceedingly prevalent during the turn out of
     1830-1 , many of the masters not daring to stir out during the
     evening .

    in one point, to support the operative , when he
    either voluntarily abstracts himself from employ,
    or is driven out by some new demand on the part
    of his master . Each trade has a sort of corpo-
    rate board for the management of its funds , the
    protection so called of its particular interests , and
    this board is paid for its services out of a specific
    allowance made by every workman who is a
   member of the union or combination . The sums
    thus abstracted from the pockets of the deluded
    artizan, have been all very considerable, the regu-
    lations being compulsory in the extreme .
    No workman is allowed to act according to the
    dictates of his own feelings- he is compelled to
   become a member, or subject himself to a course
    of annoyances and injuries which have repeatedly
    ended in death . This arbitrary and tyrannical
    assumption of power, is one of the greatest evils
    attending upon the system of combinations
    amongst the operatives . However well- disposed
    the industrious and economical workman may be,
   he is placed upon a level with the most profligate
    and idle , who are in general the stirrers up of
    these strikes ; he is condemned against his own.
   judgment to abstain from working at a price, low
    perhaps, and barely sufficient , but still enough for
    his wants ; to be satisfied with two or four shillings
    per week from the union fund for the support of
    his family, in the place of earning amongst them
    twenty or twenty- five shillings ; to remain in idle-
    ness for weeks in succession , to the utter ruin of

     his habits and is deprived of all stimulus to be a
     good and industrious citizen , by the certainty that
     he is liable to be turned out of employment from
     causes over which he has no controul , and which
     not unfrequently he cannot comprehend .
     When it is borne in mind how great a propro-
     tion of the labourers employed in factories con-
      sists of females and children, the evil presents
     itself in a still more striking point of view. In
     nineteen cases out of twenty these can have
     nothing to do with the originating the turn out,
     which is equally, however, operative upon them,
     a regular compliment and series of hands being
     necessary for the working of a mill. They are
     thus subjected to starvation and idleness, both
     exercising a most powerful influence upon their
     moral and social character-ån influence of the
     most debasing quality.
      The operations of manufacturing yarn from the
     raw material , it is true , is distinct from the manu-
     facturing it into cloth-so far the spinner and the
     weaver are completely separated ; they are , how-
     ever often carried on simultaneously in the same
     mill, the same steam- engine serving for both
     purposes . Occasions have occurred when the
     spinners have turned out leaving the weavers in
     employ, and vice versâ the weavers have turned
     out leaving the spinners in employ , each sup-
     posing itself to have separate causes for com-
     plaint or satisfaction . • The great turn outs have ,
     however, involved both , or when they have been

    partial , the injury, though less , has still been felt
   by the whole-the members of the same family or
   household being indiscriminately composed of
   spinners , weavers , and their dependants .
     It has repeatedly happened that the disputes
   which have ended in a general turn -out have had
   reference only to a very small portion of the
   hands--spinners of a particular class for example,
   such as coarse or fine yarns in the demand for
   which some change has come on, which may
   have necessitated the master to reduce the wages
   paid for its manufacture , but so complete and
   determinate has been the organization amongst
   the whole union , that thousands have deserted
    their occupation and submitted to every sort of
    suffering incident to the deepest poverty.
    Many writers , at various times when the public
   mind has been disturbed by these disastrous divi-
    sions , have stated that the funds of the unions have
    to a very considerable extent shielded the turn- outs
   from sufferings . When a turn - out is but partial—
    that is, when the hands of a particular mill , or of a
    limited portion of one of the great division of ma-
    nufacturers , from causes peculiar to themselves ,
   have struck , this statement is to some degree true,
   but in the general turn -outs , when from ten to
    eighteen thousand men, women , and children
   have to receive assistance from these funds , they
    are but a drop of water in the bucket, even though
    assisted in the most extensive way by the shop-
    keepers, and by advances from every other trade .

     which merely bore them on its surface.
      sooner were the effects ofthe vast drain upon their
     money resources felt- no sooner the first excite-
     ment passed away-than the natural interests and
     importance of each separate town or body were
      again brought into play, and want of general cor-
      diality and unanimity of acting soon rendered the
      great combinations partially inoperative .
      The scenes which were the result of these com-
      binations of labour against capital and due sub-
      ordination , all who have witnessed will join in
     condemning as tending to the destruction of
      social order, and the security of life and property ;
      and though the arm of the executive may have
      fallen heavily and indiscrinately upon the dis-
      turbers of the public peace , no man having a cor-
      rect knowledge of the results which would have
      necessarily emanated from them, can deplore or
     condemn it.
      No estimate, at all approaching to accuracy , can
     be made by persons living in districts or towns
      which have never been visited by one of these turn-
      outs, of the social disorganization which atends
     upon them. In 1805-6, when power-looms were
       first introduced , the total suspension of trade, and
      the turbulent and distracted state of the hand-
      loom weavers, with the consequent violations of
      rights ofproperty, in the destruction of machinery,
      are still well remembered . But this display of
      hostility by no means interfered with the rapid
      spread of the power-loom ; on the contrary, it only

   afforded a more decided stimulus to it . The mani-
   festation which had been made, previous to this
   epoch , of the difficulty of keeping in due subor-
   dination human power, made steam doubly wel-
   come to the manufacturers , by placing under their
   control an agent, which, their sagacity clearly fore-
   saw, would , in the course of time , render them to
   a very great degree independent of it. And events
   have justified their prognostications ; but they
   failed then, and have since failed in convincing
   the men, that they were pursuing a line of con-
   duct, which , if permitted to proceed to extremities ,
   must ruin them by ruining the manufacturers ,
   and by driving away capital, for ever deprive
   themselves of the benefits invariably resulting
   from its employ, and in shewing that their oppo-
   sition to improvements in machinery , which were
   gradually lowering their wages , only tended still
   farther to accelerate their progress .
    One great evil which has ever attended both
    partial and general strikes that have continued
   for any length of time- and some of these have
   extended over six months- is , that the means of
   the turn-out have been quite exhausted , long
   before he again got to work . The pittance he
   received from the Union did but little towards his
   support, and hence he was necessitated to get
    into debt, and pay a most extortionate price for
   the common necessaries of life . These engage-
   ments were, of course , to the retail dealers in
    provisions, who were themselves not unfrequently

     ruined by a system of credit , far too extensive for
      their limited capital . In all cases, however, the
     long arrear had to be paid up whenever work was
     obtained , and this absorbed the greater portion
     of their wages for many months,-thus prolonging
     the distress which had already well nigh over-
     whelmed them . This has been one great cause of
     the squalid wretchedness so generally found in
     the houses of the operatives .
       It is obvious, from the preceding details, that
     combinations of workmen against masters- of
      labour against capital- have uniformly, in the
      manufacturing districts , been injurious to the
     men to a much greater extent than to the master.
      His capital, it is true, was for the time injured ,
      but he had means of supporting himself during
      these struggles. The nature of his investment
      prevented him from carrying away his capital and
      enterprise to other localities , and other ways
      of employing them ; and in this has consisted one
      great cause of the stability of manufacturers .
      Building and machinery could not be removed
      nor converted into portable property, without a
      ruinous sacrifice . Often, indeed , the manufac-
      turer has been heard to deplore this as his
      greatest hardship , which was in point of fact his
       greatest advantage , for it prevented his abstrac-
       tion, and by forcing him to submit to a temporary
      inconvenience , he was sure , in a short time , to be
       right again . The same fact-and it is one which
       strongly illustrates the almost paradoxical propo-

    sition , that men rarely know what is their real
   advantage-induced the workmen to believe , that
   thus having the property of their master fast in
    its present position , they could the more easily
   make him compromise himself. It had , in point
   of fact, exactly the opposite effect in both cases .
   On the side of the master he was chained down,
   and thus compelled to wait for a revulsion in the
   popular mind ; on that of the workmen , in spite of
   all the precautions they could adopt, new hands
   were invariably introduced , or means taken to
   secure their introduction , when the storm was
   blown over ; added to which, the mill - owner, thus
   deserted by his men, turned his attention and
   efforts to the improvement of his machinery, and
   acquired a practical knowledge of its operations,
   and capabilities for alteration, which , under a
   different state of things , he might possibly never
   have acquired . *
    The general combinations , which include nearly
   the whole of the manufacturing population , and
   which are so mischievous in their effects , have
   numerous minor and subsidiary co -operative
   unions . The spinners , weavers , piecers , finish-
   ers, &c. &c. each combine in their own class , and
   have each distinct rules and regulations for their
   direction ; subordinate , however, to the general
   confederations into which their distinct interests
   merge . The same evils in a minor degree attend

     upon these ; the divisions amongst them being
     founded chiefly with regard to the amount ofwages
     received , and the differences in the amounts of
      contributions paid into the general fund . They
      are, however, quite distinct in their separate cor-
      porate capacities, acting quite independently of
     one another, and assimilating only in being parties
      in the general combination .
       Independently of associations for the fancied
      protection of the general and separate interests
      of the several classes which compose the manufac-
      turers , and which relate to general questions
     connected with their interests , every mill has its
      peculiar arrangements . These are regulations as
     to hours of work, fines for imperfect work, regu-
      lations as to the engine , &c . &c . , and are com-
     monly made in conjunction with the master, and
      are indeed necessary for the interests of both, as
     they serve as mutual checks , and as restrictions
     upon the conduct of the overlookers , engine men ,
     and are thus found mutually advantageous .
       In looking back at the history of the cotton
     manufacture , and in examining the rise and
     growth of combinations amongst workmen , it may
     be asserted , that but for the application of steam ,
      it must either have been destroyed by those who

     have been so restricted in its operations , and so

      of the country, and thus, too, quite independent

   of the additional power gained by it . To what
   extent hand manufacture might have gone, it is
   not easy even to guess. But is quite certain that
    it might have gone vastly farther than it has ever
   yet been pushed . If all the individuals now en-
   gaged in this manufacture, were devoted to hand
   labour, an immense amount of production would
   be the result, though infitely inferior to that now
   existing. But there is no reason why double the
   amount of hands should not be engaged in it, or
   treble, or any amount that would be sufficient
   to throw off as much work as would equal
   the present joint production of steam and hand
   labour.
    Such a mass of labourers, brought into intimate
   communion with each other would , however, be
   utterly unmanageable . Trade would be liable to
   fluctuations which must ruin it, and its entire
   control wouldC be vested in the workmen. If
   combinations have been ruinous to some masters,
   and injurious to trade at some junctures with the
   aid of steam , in some degree an independent
   power, what would have been their effect if it
   must have entirely submitted to their caprice ?
    The moral influence of combinations upon the
   character of the manufacturing population, has
   been exceedingly pernicious . It has placed a bar-
   rier between the master and the hands which can
   never be removed , but with the utmost difficulty ;
   for neither dare trust the other . Suspicion has
   usurped the place of confidence ; an utter aliena-

     tion of all friendly feelings- mutual fear- hatred ,
    and a system of espionage totally subversive of
     every thing honourable in their intercourse.
     Nothing can more strongly mark the demoraliza-
     tion brought about by the agency of turn-outs , the
     result of combination , than the acts which have
    been committed by the men , and openly boasted
     of. Cutting away cloth from the looms of those
     better disposed individuals who preferred working
     for the support of their families , to starving in obe-
     dience to a fiat to strike -a system of inquisitorial
     visitation ruinous to neighbourly kindness-the
     darker crime of vitriol-throwing-more cowardly
    and treacherous than the stab of the Italian bravo
    -the waylaying and abusing obnoxious indivi-
     duals-and the stain which must ever rest upon
    them , indelibly marked , and branding them with
    infamy-that of murder.
     The demonstrations of vengeance [,] [carried][ into]

     masters to arm themselves- to garrison their
     houses and mills , and have placed a whole district

     social ties incident to civil warfare . No man was
     safe-no family secure from midnight disturbance[ ;]

   no wonder that feelings of bitterness were roused
   against those who thus wantonly violated all the
   forms of decency and justice .
    Another moral evil of equal magnitude to the
   labourer, resulting from combinations , is , that it
   renders himself and family improvident, and this
   is the very bane of all his comfort . Whatever the
   cause may be which renders a man's labour of
   doubtful continuance , or which occasionally, and
   at uncertain intervals , throws him out of employ,
   it invariably injures his industrial character.
  The same remark has been used before , when
   speaking of the hand-loom weavers , whose oc-
   cupation was irregular and fluctuating. It was
   very truly observed by Mr. Galloway, in his evi-
   dence, that " When employers are competent to
  shew their men that their business is steady and
   certain, and that when men find that they are
   likely to have permanent employment , they have
   always better habits and more settled notions ,
   which will make them better men and better
  workmen, and will produce great benefits to all
  who are interested in their employment." In
   these respects the combinations and " strikes "
   have been ruinous to a degree . A consciousness
   that there is this uncertainty with regard to the
   continuance of his work , removes from the labourer
   all stimulus to work diligently, and earn for him-
   self an honest reputation . He feels that he is
   no free agent in the matter, and loses , in conse-
   quence, much of that personal respect for himself

     without which he possesses but half his moral
     stamina .
      The repeated evils brought upon the masters by
     the combinations of their hands , made it impera-
     tively necessary that they should be met in a si-
     milar way. No master could cope single - handed
     with a combination of his own men, who were
     leagued together to prevent any sufficient supply,
     of new hands , and were liberally supported by
      their co-mates . The interests of the masters hav-
     ing become more generally understood , and that
     of one identified with the rest, they in turn refused
       * to employ any operative who made himself
     conspicuous in the combinations , and gradually
     feeling their own strength , dismissed all those who
     could be detected as belonging to the obnoxious
     unions . Not satisfied with this, however, they
     refused to engage a workman who had been dis-
     missed or had voluntarily withdrawn himself from
     the service of another master provided he did not
     bring with him a character. This once gained , the
     masters had the destiny of each operative in their
     keeping. If he disbehaved himself he was straight-
     way dismissed, and found himself, unless under
     very peculiar circumstances, utterly excluded
     from all chance of getting occupation in that town
      or district, and had no little difficulty in procuring
      it even if he removed . For a time he received a
      pittance from the joint funds, which spite of all
     the vigilance exercised for its suppression , still
      existed .

    So long as masters confine themselves to the le-
   gitimate objects which should govern their unions ;
   viz. protection against the unfounded and unrea-
   sonable demands of their workmen- the cultivation
   of their own undoubted authority , with the interior
   regulation of their mills-their efforts will be hailed
   and cordially seconded by every man who has a
   knowledge of the miseries incident to the want of
   these, and who looks forward to a regeneration
   in the moral and social condition of the operatives .
   It is much to be feared, however, that these com-
   binations may not end here. The terrible lessons
   which have been taught the masters will lead them
   to exert every device, to strain every nerve, in
   order to annihilate the influence of the men be-
   yond simple and subordinate agents to their
   tractable and gigantic servant the steam-engine ;
   and in doing this, both the interests of the men,
   and that of the public, might very probably
    suffer .
     It is very true, notwithstanding these changes,
   and notwithstanding the diminished influence
   of the general combinations, partial out-breaks ,
   directed against a particular master, still occur,
   shewing the smouldering fire which it is so de-
    sirable to extinguish. In these cases it however
   generally happens, that the causes in dispute are
    entirely local and confined to a particular order of
   workmen, often indeed arising from trivial altera-
    rations introduced by the owner in some particular
    quality ofwork or mill regulation. The old spirit

```

```
      exists in this respect of striving by every means of
     intimidation , and even resorting to acts of personal
     violence, to deter new men from being engaged.
     Even at the moment this page is writing, a scene
     of this nature is going on within fifty yards of the
      author's study window, accompanied with all the
     confusion naturally incident to such outrage.
      If experience could have taught the men wis-
     dom, they would long ago have learnt that riot
     could serve no good purpose, and that now the
     masters are banded together, and know their in-
      terests to depend upon the exclusion of turbulence
     from their mills , it must be fatal to any party of
     them who indulge in it . They cannot prevent
     the introduction of new hands, they cannot pre-
     vent improvements in machinery ; and though
     their wages must suffer, and though their labour
     must go on increasing to acquire even the wages
     they now earn, there is no human power to inter-
     fere with or thwart it.
      The moral effects of combinations amongst the
     masters are, the keeping alive those suspicions
     which have so long been the bane both to the hap-
     piness of the labourer and to their own . Ever dis-
     posed to view all attempts at change as innovations
     upon what he erroneously conceives to be a matter
     under his own control, the workman murmurs
     and finally rebels , if he finds that these changes
     are tending to increase his hours of labour without
     an adequate compensation . As he finds, however,
     that his rebellion has ceased to be beneficial, that

    his master assumes a higher tone, and, spite of all
    his efforts, contrives to carry on the operations of
    his mill partly by the introduction of new hands ,
   and partly by improving his machinery, he will
    surely discover that he had better, in place of be-
   coming a turn-out, endeavour, by exertion , by
   economy, by domestic habits, by acquiring feelings
   of providence and anxiety for something beyond
    to -day, remedy, as far as is in his power, the change
    in his circumstances . If masters will combine
    steadily, and aim at inculcating subordination ,
    respect for proper authority, and to these add their
    anxious endeavours to effect these desirable alte-
    rations in the present characters of their workmen ,
   which can alone render them permanently quiet,
    they will deserve well of their country. If they
    succeed in establishing their own power upon the
   wreck of the labourer's independence and morality,
   they will have nothing to congratulate themselves
   upon, and must ever live on the surface of a vol-
    cano, which at any moment may be roused into
    destructive action.
     There are questionless many of the great cotton-
    spinners who are ardently desirous to see an
   amendment in the moral and social condition of
    their hands, and who take every means in their
   power to effect this . Hitherto these efforts have
    been attended with but little success , and some of
   them have raised the cry, that it is useless to at-
    tempt to influence the conduct of these men ; that
    they meet with nothing but the basest ingratitude,

     and that the best thing they can do is to reduce
     them as rapidly as possible to mere automata, and
     deprive them of every inducement to exercise
      their will, by grinding them down by labour and
     starvation. That they have met with repulses
      sufficiently disgusting and disheartening is very
     probable, but they suffer their passions to run
     away with their judgments when they condemn the
    men for expressions of hatred and distrust which
     are explicable, and if not excusable, may be so
      far palliated by circumstances and considerations
     as no longer to brand upon them the impress of
     stupid and brutal ingratitude.
      Years must elapse before entire confidence can
     be restored between the opposing parties, if both
     do not cordially join in striving to forget and for-
     give injuries and insults- innumerable, and bitter
     to the memory. But upon the masters, as men of
     education, men of extended and enlightened view,
     the principal part of the task devolves very naturally
     and properly. Let them combine strictly, let the
     law give them its utmost protection , -- but let those
     powers and combinations be tempered with justice
     and mercy. They have the social, moral, and
     domestic condition of the men intimately under
     their influence and command - let their example, in
     the first place, afford them a lesson of order, de-
     cency, proper economy, and religion ; and secondly,
     let them remember that excess of labour partially
     unfits them for the display of those virtues which
     can alone give them any chance of happiness or
     comfort.

     It is morally impossible that the condition of the
    great bulk of the labouring community can be ever
   permanently benefited so long as they permit
   themselves to be led away by designing and fac-
    tious individuals, who live upon their passions and
   ignorance. Till a restoration of confidence be-
   tween them and their employers they will be liable
    to this misleading. Whenever any question hav-
   ing reference to the interests of either party is
   under discussion, these agitators immediately stir
    themselves to effect a breach between the em-
    ployers and the employed, and it very frequently
    happens, that the first intimation that a master
    receives of his men interesting themselves on any
    subject, is the sight of a petition containing the
    signatures of all of them. This display of want
    of confidence on the part of the men , and the
    secrecy and sometimes little understood way in
    which they receive information , renders the mas-
    ters jealous and suspicious, and spite of their pru-
    dence, they shew their feelings pretty plainly.
   Hence it is that so little progress is as yet made
    towards a proper understanding between them,
    whilst the actions of each are scrutinized closely ;
   when, on the one hand, it should be ready obe-
    dience, and, on the other, confidence and affability.
      Intellectual education, by partially expanding
    the views of the operative, has as yet done little
    towards improving his correct judgment, and
    enabling him to detect the mischief that may lurk
    beneath the disguise of apparent sympathy when

     general standard will enable them in time to lay
     down such rates of wages as will be universally
      applicable ; some time must necessarily elapse
     before this can take place. The great manufac-
      turers, who also invariably possess the best ma-
     chinery, can afford to make goods at a something
      less price than the secondary men . If a strict
     combination were therefore to take place amongst
     them, and they were determined to sell as low as
      possible and keep their wages down , they would
     speedily ruin the inferior manufacturer, who hav-
     ing a limited capital, second rate machinery and
     an absolute necessity for quick returns, could not
     meet them in the market. A tacit [agreement]
     seems to exist, by which the operative and manu-
     facturer at present benefit at the expense of the
     public, and this enables the inferior man to make
     a profit under all his disadvantages. The outcry
     as to the ruin of the trade is a positive absurdity-
      it may be confidently asserted that those manufac-

   tories which are extensive and upon the most ap-
  proved arrangement as to machinery are making
  immense returns, and the proprietors could afford
  to work them, and sell at a very considerable
   diminished price.
    If the workmen could be brought to understand
  some of these truths, a better chance would be
  given for a union taking place between them and
  the masters, and both would succeed in keeping
  up a remunerating price for their separate capitals ;
  whereas the men, on the one hand, by injuring
  the property of their masters, compel them to
  reduce their wages as a compensation, or to de-
  mand such excellence of work, and to cut off so
  much for fines, that it amounts to the same thing
  as reduction ; whilst on the other hand the master,
   finding his hands thus turbulent and unruly, turns
   all his energies to improvements in his machinery,
  and endeavours, by throwing off an increased
   quantity of work, to make amends for the incerti-
  tude in his labourers . This often produces gluts,
  which injure , again , both masters and men .
  Another advantage would be gained by a mutual
  understanding : during turn -outs great numbers
  of new hands come into the town or district where
   it exists, generally hand-loom weavers, or opera-
   tives from other classes of manufacturers , or in-
   dividuals from the mining districts ; and, rather
  than have their mills remaining totally idle, the

     ignorant of the details of spinning or weaving ;
     much has to be taught them ; a great deal of work
      is spoiled, and much loss sustained for a time. The
     men finding their places partially occupied, and
     their obstinacy and turbulence yielding before
     continued privations, gladly return at the old
     prices : many of necessity cannot be taken in, as
      it would be a manifest injustice to discharge the
     hands they have, even though inferior in capability
     for producing good work. Thus they are com-
     pelled to seek work somewhere else, or lower their
     wages, and have been instrumental in introducing
     a greater number of hands than can find present
     employ, and hence the foundation for another re-
     duction of wages before any very long period.
      The most important benefit which the men
     would derive from coalescing with their masters ,
     and agreeing to some certain standard rules for
      their mutual regulation , is that both would very
     soon think each other trustworthy, and those feel-
      ings of hostility and bitterness which now exist
     between them , and which are kept up by com-
      binations-delegates - secretaries -would be done

     pect to do this, so long as they submit to the dic-
      tates of parties interested in keeping up mischief
     between them and their masters. The moral re-
      volution which this would at once produce, would

   do not adopt some plan of this nature[,] they [will]
   miss the opportunity, and will condemn themselves
   to a life of servitude to an iron master[,] who is
   already more than threatening them. Let them
   remember that already the steam-engine, though
   applied to the same purposes as human labour for
   so very few years, performs as much work, in
   simple power, as two millions and a half of human
   beings ! Let them farther remember, that each
   steam-loom is nearly four times as effective as the
   hand-loom , and that improvements are hourly
   taking place in its applicability-giving it endow-
   ments- approximating it with the most delicate
   operations of the human hand ; and let them
   remember, also , that it never tires ; that to it
    eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, or twenty hours are
    alike ! To endeavour to arrest its progress would
   be madness : they cannot turn back the stream of
   "
   events -the onward current of the age - their
    efforts would be equally impotent and ruinous [.]
   They may, however, compete with it on more
   equal ground if they choose, and may prevent the
    accelerations of its career by working steadily,
    orderly, and systematically. Every effort which
   they have made to retard or destroy the progress
   of machinery, has only hurried on the march [of]
   improvement ; and if they persevere in such a
    course of proceedings , they will become [its] [vic-]

     former period. Their attempts to break up the
     social confederacy by violence and outrage, and
     thus bring on such internal disorder as would
     deprive the nation of its manufacturing pre-
     eminence, must and will be suppressed by the
     strong arm of the law.
      Let the masters, then, combine - let them
     elevate their own character- let them become
     great and wealthy ; for greatness and wealth,
    when joined to correct knowledge of the wants
     of those around them, are the best masters . Let
     them, by every means in their power, aid the
     moral and social regeneration of their men ; and
     let the men meet them frankly and fairly ; let
     them be assisted to shake off habits which destroy
     them physically and morally ; let them cultivate
     home ; let them become good husbands and good
     wives, and they will, in a single generation, pro-
     duce offspring who will, in their turn , inherit their
     good qualities. Let them discountenance agita-
      tion, combination, and political quacks. Let them
     become a sober and orderly race ; let them, if they
      will, appeal to the legislature for enactments to
      regulate their labour, if excessive- and by so doing
     they will be their own best friends. With economy
     and foresight, the means they possess are sufficient
      to supply their wants, and the requisites of their
      stations ; and were these doubled, without economy,
     they would be no real gainers. Let them bear in

    reunite ; let them eschew the gin and beer-shops, -

    lation. But if they do not, they may depend upon
    this, that they will be ground down to the earth ,
   and present the most humiliating and miserable
    picture of humanity which the world has ever
   yet seen - save only the slave-gang, and the
    Indian miners , under the deadly yoke of the early
    Spaniards.
     It has been truly observed by Mr. M'Culloch,
   " that the operatives are in great measure the
    architects of their own fortunes ; for what others
   can do for them is trifling indeed, compared with
   what they can do for themselves . That they are
    infinitely more interested in the preservation of
    public tranquillity than any other class of society ;
    that mechanical inventions and discoveries are su-
   premely advantageous to them ; and that their real
    interests can only be efficiently protected by dis-
   playing greater prudence and forethought ." *
    The influence of machinery upon human labour,
   has some points which connects the question closely
   with that of combinations amongst the ' masters .
   The remark in the foregoing quotation from
   M'Culloch, " that mechanical inventions and dis-
    coveries are supremely advantageous to them,"
    i. e. the manufacturing population , is far too ge-

     neral and sweeping, and an attentive examination
     of the subject would have sufficed to satisfy the
     author that he was suffering imperfect data to
     mislead his judgment, and was hazarding an as-
     sertion unsustained by facts, whether of observation
     or reasoning.
     " One very important inquiry," says Mr. Bab-
     bage, " which this subject presents, is the question,
     Whether it is more for the interest of the working
      classes that improved machinery should be so per-
     fect as to defy the competition of hand-labour, and
     that they should thus at once be driven out of the
     trade by it, or be gradually forced to quit it, by
     the slow and successive advances of the machine ?
     The suffering which arises from a quick transition
      is undoubtedly more intense, but it is also much
      less permanent than than which results from the
     slower process ; and if the competion is perceived
     to be perfectly hopeless , the workman will at once
      set himself to learn a new department of his art.
    On the other hand, although new machinery
     causes an increased demand for skill in those who
     make and repair it, and in those who first superin-
     tend its use, yet there are other cases in which it
     enables children and infirm workmen to execute
     work that previously required greater skill . In
     such circumstances, even though the increased
     demand for the article, produced by its diminished
     price, should speedily give occupation to all who
     were before unemployed, yet this very diminution
     of skill required, would open a wider field for

    But then, in opposition to these, must be taken
   into account, their incessant occupation , without a
   moment's pause or relaxation , bound down by the
   motions of the engine, which requires their untir-
   ing and most assiduous attention . They are indeed
    its bond-slaves , and it is a severe task-master- no
    interval is allowed- no voluntary cessation . Many
    scattered allusions have been made in previous
   portions ofthe work on this subject, in connexion
   with other circumstances influencing their cha-
   racter.
     It has been remarked by Mr. Babbage, that " if
   the competition between machinery and human
   labour is perceived to be perfectly hopeless , the
   workman will at once set himself to learn a new
   department of his art." Were this possible, the
   necessary consequences of mechanical improve-
   ment would signify nothing ; but it is impossible,
   and a reference to his own table on hand-loom
   weavers will sufficiently show that there are insur-
   mountable difficulties in the way of the conversion
   of a great body of operatives from one industrial
   condition to another.
    Whoever is in the habit of visiting the work-
     * " It appears that the number of hand-looms in use in
    England and Scotland in 1830 was about 240,000- nearly the
    same number existed in 1820. During the whole of this period
    the wages and employment of hand-loom weavers have been
    very precarious ."-Babbage, p. 340.

     great cotton manufacturers from time to time,

     ments in the application of machinery. These
     improvements, though they may not enable the`
     master to dismiss any of his hands, prevents the
     necessity for engaging fresh ones , though he doubles
     the productive powers of his mill . Thus , in 1806,
     from the table given above, it appears that 300
    men would have been required to turn off the
     same quantity of work as is now turned offby 100 ;
     and this disproportion is constantly increasing. It
      is here that machinery threatens the manufacturing
     population.
      The rapid growth of the staple branch of manu-
     facture -the cotton trade, has caused vast imini-
     grations into those districts in which it is principally
     carried on. The depression in the agricultural

     losses from turn-outs, extended stoppages, and va-
    rious other impediments which would be thrown
    in their way, they prefer the slower process of me-
     chanical improvement, by which, though they may
     triple the production, but require no new men.*
      To show the extent of foreign competition at present[,] the
     following data are given :-
      It appears that in 1821 the exportation of raw cotton from
     the United States of America to France, and the European con-
     tinent, was somewhat more than one-sixth of the quantity sent
     to Great Britain. In 1832 it amounted to more than one-half.
      In 1831 France produced [63,000,000][ lbs][.][ of][ cotton][ yarn][,]
     which will have required a consumption ofnearly 80,000,000[ lbs][.]
     of the raw material [.] In the same year the export of cotton
     goods from that country amounted to 2,192,240f[.]
      In Switzerland the consumption of cotton in 1831 amounted
     to 19,000,000 lbs. Only a few years have elapsed since that
     country received the greatest part of her supplies of yarn from
     England ; she now not only receives very little below seventy
     shillings, but she has herself become an exporter to other
     countries.
     The manufacture of cotton is rapidly increasing in Prussia
     throughout the Rhenish provinces , in Silesia, in Saxony, and
     in both the German and Italian provinces belonging to the
     crown of Austria.
     From information obtained on the spot, or replies to ques-
     tions which were sent to manufacturers on the continent, it ap-
     pears that they can compete successfully with England in coarse
     numbers --- some say as high as 40s. , others as high as 70s. and
     80s. It must be kept in mind the quantity of yarn spun in
     England above 80s. is very small-about the proportion of 100
     or 120 lbs. of coarse for one pound of fine.
     The wages paid per week in England and the continent are
     as follows :--
                      England. Continent.
       For spinners · • • 20s. to 35s. 8s. to 10s.
       Piecers • 4s. 8s. · 2s. 3s.
       Card-room hands . • 6s. 14s . · 4s. 5s.
       Reelers 7s. 13s. 4s. 6s.

    But these improved applications of mechanism
    will not end here . Whenever the pressure of
   foreign or domestic competition becomes more
   severe, the masters will be necessiated to avail
   themselves to the utmost of every thing which can
    assist in lowering the price of their products , and
   human labour must and will be pushed to the wall .
   Many great changes will of course take place be-
    fore this inevitable result is gained, and reductions
    in wages for quantity will be constantly progress-
     There is no cotton twist of low numbers now exported from
    England to France, or Switzerland. Last year there were
    several orders came for yarns from Germany, restricted to a
    certain price, but stating that this fixed price was what it could
    be spun for in that country-these prices were ad per pound
    lower than they could possibly be produced here.
     In America the official report of the committee of the New
   York Convention shows a consumption in 1831 of 77,516,316lbs .
    of cotton, which equals the quantity consumed in Great Britain
    twenty years ago. American fabrics are rapidly superseding
    those of this country in Mexico, the Brazils , and, in fact,
    throughout all the markets of the South American continent,
    and have been brought this year in much larger quantities than
    heretofore into the ports of the Mediterranean , which can only
    be accounted for by the success which has attended their pre-
    vious transactions.
     It will also be kept in mind, that two very important items
    in the cost of a piece of cotton cloth, are raw cotton and food.
   How much greater, therefore, must the advantages of these
    rivals, who obtain both these articles free from taxation, pay
    no poor rates, and negotiate for manufacturing labour free from
    time bills, & c.
     The superiority of machinery, and trade details possessed by
    Great Britain, are abundantly obvious from the above details.
    It enables her to compete with manufactures who have the
    opportunity of paying one-fourth the price for the raw material,
    although she pays her workmen a fourfold price for his labour.

      ing ; but the ultimatum is less remote than those
      interested in it are aware off, for let it be remem-
      bered that all mechanical applications, and the
     moving power derived from the expansive nature
     of steam, have as yet but arrived at one point in
      their career, and this point says nothing as to what
     may be done. There can be no question whatever
      that many processes for which the human hand
       is at present indispensible, will very shortly have
     machines adapted to them, that, if they will not
      quite displace the workman , will render one man ca-
      pable ofproducing, or rather of superintending, the
      production of quantity now requiring ten or twenty
      labourers . This is no theoretical opinion , the
     whole history of the cotton manufacture attests its
      truth , and collateral proofs are abundant in other
     branches of manufacture.
       It does not follow that improvements in existing
     machinery, or every new machine, should at once
     throw out a number of hands. Those, however,
     who argue that machinery never has that effect,
     and never will have it , either wilfully delude them-
      selves , or take a very limited and imperfect view
      of the subject. It must have one of two effects,
     the objects of every change, improvement, and
      addition, being to lessen the amount of labour re-
      quired for production , and this must be either to
      render fewer workmen necessary to produce a given
      quantity of manufacture , or so far lower the price
     of the manufacture, as at once to increase the de-
     mand for it so considerably as to absorb the same

   number of men as are already engaged in it. In
   many instances, in fact, generally the latter, has
   been the case hitherto, and would, perhaps, con-
   tinue to be so, were Great Britain entirely to
   monopolize manufactures . But this cannot be,
   and as it has been before stated , the maximium
   must be attained. All these improvements having
   therefore one end , all tending to the same point ;
   namely, the cheapening of labour . The time must
   come, when its value will be so small , as to make
   it nearly worthless to the possessor .
    The consequences of this it would be rash to
   predicate. There is, however, no reason to sup-
   pose that some other great national branch of in-
   dustry may not develop itself as the cotton trade •
   has done . Steam, which has effected so much ,
   may do vastly more in altering or increasing other
   divisions of manufacture ; and there are other ma-
   terial agents, which may not improbably be brought
   to bear upon production , and so diminish its value
   beyond any thing at present calculated upon , as
   to require all the human aid that can be found for
    it at a remunerating price.
   A crisis has, however, partly arisen , and it be-
   hoves every man, interested in the welfare of his
   country, to examine into the present means for
   lessening its inevitable evils . An ingenious and
   eloquent writer in the Quarterly Review has said,
  " So far are we from regarding the increased use
   of machinery as an evil which requires to be
   checked, that we hail every such application of
                   Ꮓ

```
     the discoveries of science as another step in the
      steady course by which the Author of Nature
     pushes forward the improvement of the human
      race. In our opinion, instead of being an evil to
     be deprecated, and if possible counteracted and
      repressed, the application of machinery, as a sub-
      stitute for labour, serves to disengage a large num-
     ber of human beings from manufacturing toil, in
      order that they may be employed in perfecting and
     extending our tillage, thereby at once increasing
      their own happiness and the resources of the
     empire. "
      He goes on to say, "We have arrived at a great
     and most important crisis of social arrangement.
    We are embarrassed with a superfluity of human
      labour, of animal machines, which cannot be ab-
      sorbed in manufacturing operations . What is to
     be done with this superfluous, or rather disposable
     fund of human physical power : shall these men be
      compelled to eke out a miserable existence, with
      half employment and scanty wages ? or shall they be
     thrown upon their respective parishes for eleemosy-
     nary relief?"
       In speaking of the crisis which led to the intro-
      duction of poor laws, and laid the foundation for
     some extension of manufactures, and that had re-
      sulted from excess of agricultural labourers , and
     the breaking up of the monastic revolutions, he
     remarks :-
     "The extent to which the employment of ma-
      chinery has been pushed, as a substitute for human

```

-----

```
   labour, has at length brought on a new crisis : it is
   one essentially different from that which presented
   itself to the statesmen of the sixteenth century,
   and which appears to demand a different remedy.
   Then the agricultural population had become too
   numerous, whilst a large proportion of the surplus
   produce of the English land was exported in ex-
   change for wrought commodities : -now, the diffi-
   culty is of a totally different origin and kind. So
   far are our manufactures from requiring an in-
   creased supply of hands. that they overflow with
   workmen, for whose industry there is no profitable
   demand . The employment of machinery not only
   stops up the gap through which the surplus of our
   agricultural population had been used to make its way
   into manufactories, but it has likewise thrown out
   of employment a considerable portion of the hands
   which had been previously occupied in the fabri-
   cation of wrought commodities . From both these
   sources, a number of unemployed hands accumu-
   late the gradual increase of population produces
   a surplus of labourers , who cannot find profitable
   employment in the tillage of our old lands ; and
   to this surplus is daily added a crowd of workmen ,
   whom the extension and improvement of machinery
   disengages from manufactories."
    But these do not constitute all the elements of
   the crisis which is developing itself. Agriculture
    is undergoing a transition as great, and almost as
   remarkable as manufacture- and these are pro-
   gressing, step by step , to one and to the same end.

     Mechanical contrivances for lessening human la-
     bour, are sought for with as great avidity in the
     one case as in the other ; and in a single instance,
      that of the use of a peculiarly constructed
     plough for hoeing up potatoes , one man and one
     horse get through as much work, as would, a few
     years ago, have required at least thirty labourers,
     and perform the task much more completely and
      efficiently and this is only one solitary ex-
     ample . The current of prejudice has, hitherto,
     run strongly against the use of machines for
     farming purposes, and has been kept up by the
     limited intelligence existing amongst farmers as a
     class. The depression which has been gradually
     but steadily creeping over them , has, at length,
     succeeded in breaking up the cottier and small
     farm system , and has thrown agriculture into a
    new shape and into new hands ; which has brought
      all the force of this epoch of mechanism to bear
     upon it. The same causes are at work, therefore .
     upon the two great divisions of national industry,

     felt by the agricultural than the manufacturing
     labourer ; and have, in a great measure , already
     pauperized the whole body, and nearly extin-
     guished the peasantry, as a moral and independent
     class of the community. The present crisis in-
     volves not one particular portion of labourers, or
     one particular branch of trade, but the interests
     and future welfare of all, are intimately connected
     with it. The time, indeed, appears rapidly

   approaching, when the people, emphatically so
   called, and which have hitherto been considered
   the sinews of a nations strength, will be even
   worse than useless . When the manufactories will
   be filled with machinery, impelled by steam, so
   admirably constructed, as to perform nearly all the
   processes required in them , and when land will be
   tilled by the same means . Neither are these
   visionary anticipations ; and these include but a
   fraction of the mighty alterations to which the
   next century will give birth . Well then, may the
   question be asked-what is to be done ? Great
   calamities must be suffered . No transition so
   universal, so extensive can be operated without
   immense present sacrifices ; but upon what class ,
   or what division of property or industry these
   must be more especially inflicted, it is impossible
   clearly to indicate . Much should be done-and
   done vigourously and resolutely. Like other
   great revolutions in the social arrangement of
   kingdoms, it is to be feared that the explosion
   will be permitted to take place, undirected by the
   guiding hand of any patriotic and sagacious spirit,
   and its fragments be again huddled together in
   hurry and confusion ; and finally to undergo a
    series of painful gradations, from which the imagi-
   nation turns with sickening terror.

      The impossibility of the legislature effectually
     interfering between the master and the labourer,
      is sufficiently proved by the failure of the laws
     with respect to the truck system. It is true they
     have in some degree checked the evil, or rather

   have compelled the master to mask their dealings
   so as to evade their penal operations . The truck
   system as it is termed , is the payment of the la-
   bourer not in money, but goods, thus converting
   the master into a shop-keeper or a retail dealer.
     This is a species of combination, which is inju-
    rious alike to the character of the master and his
   men, and one the abolition of which it would be
   very desirable to see for both their sakes . It is
    unjust to the labourer in many ways— it assists in
   the ruin of his feelings of independance and free
   agency, and keeps down his provident wishes, -in
    as much as he has no opportunity of being pro-
   vident.
    Next to the evil influence of combinations of
   workmen upon the social and moral character, is
   the truck system. It is one which deserves severe
   condemnation, and which the masters will do well
    to reflect upon, for it is founded on injustice, and
    enables them to oppress the men, whilst at the
   same time it deprives them of all means of resist-
   ance.
     It has been urged by some writers, * that the
     " When the number of workmen living upon the same
    spot is large, it may be thought desirable that they should
    unite together, and have an agent to purchase by wholesale
    those articles which are most in demand, such as tea, sugar,
    bacon, &c., and to retail them at prices which will just repay
    the wholesale cost, together with the expense of the agent who
    conducts their sale. If this be managed wholly by a committee
    of workmen, aided perhaps by advice from the master, and if
    the agent is paid in such a manner as to have himself an interest

```

```
    men should unite and establish shops for their
     own supply of the necessaries or comforts of life,
     such as tea, coffee, sugar, soap, &c . &c. There
      is no question that the retail dealer, the petty
     shop -keeper, gains a very large profit by his sales ,
      partly by overcharging, and partly by adulterating
      his articles, and that so far the men would improve
      their situation if they could do away with this.
    A little acquaintance with their characters and
      feelings would dissipate any notion of precon-
      ceived advantages, which they would derive from
     an establishment of a joint stock concern, in the
      majority of instances , and besides it is impractic-
      able from many causes . They will suffer the least
     from an adherence to the old plan both in a pecu-
      niary and in a moral point of view- and the retail
      dealer will be by simple competition brought to
      something like a moderate demand for the em-
      ployment of his capital.
      The case, however, is widely different with re-
     gard to the master. They have indeed urged
      that the men are still free to purchase at their
     shop or elsewhere as best suits their convenience.
     The statement is fallacious and unworthy conside-
      ration- the men are not, cannot be free agents in
      the matter. Abundant means are in the hands of
      in procuring good and reasonable articles, it may be a benefit
      to the workman.”—Babbage, p . 308.
       There are innumerable difficulties in the way of Mr. Bab-
      bage's scheme, advantageous as it appears at first sight , and in
       practice it would be found totally useless .

   the master to compel them by indirect measures
   to confine themselves to his shop, and in very nu-
   merous instances no such reserve is shewn , but
   the men are presented with a ticket to nearly the
    full amount of their wages, and this is alone nego-
    tiable at these shops . It has happened repeat-
    edly that the workman wanting a few shillings
    for some other purpose, has consented to take a
   sum considerably less than was his right rather
    than have articles which he either did not want,
    or that he wanted something else more indispen-
    sably and immediately - and this was his only
   mode of procuring the needful sum at an immense
    sacrifice .
     If the masters object was the advantage of [the]
    labourer, and if the labourer could be induced[ to]
    give him credit that it was so, and if the master
    employed a portion of his capital to the purchase
    of wholesome goods, and retailed them at a lower
    price than the common shopkeeper, which he
    could well afford to do , and still have a fair return[ ,]
    some of the objections against the system [would]
     fall to the ground . But it is just the reverse-
    the price charged by the master is invariably as
    high and in many instances much higher than [his]
    humble neighbour, and his goods very generally
     inferior, and retailed out so arbitrarily as to in-
    crease the other mischiefs . Many masters in all
    branches of manufactures are in the habit of
     killing cows, sheep, pigs , &c., very extensively,
    and distributing the meat amongst their men[,][ at][ a]

     price universally above the market average ; many
     are dealers in coal, and in short every commodity
     required by the operative, some or other of these
     masters deal in . *
      The evils of this system are so apparent[,] and[ its]
     injustice so gross and glaring, that nothing but [a]
     very low estimate of morality can be possessed [by]
     those masters who are engaged in [it][ .] They drive
      all competitors at once from the field, ruining
     numbers of decent retailers and forcing them a
     step downwards in the social scale[,] by [converting]
     them into labourers, and obliging their families[,]
    who were most probably living at home in domes-
      tic privacy, and preparing themselves [for] [decent]
     members of society, into the mill[,] -a situation [cer-]
     tain to do away with many of those probabilities[.]
     They thus prevent any middle class betwixt [them-]
      selves and their operatives from springing into
     permanent existence-a class to which the indus-
      trious, economical, and well - disposed workman
     might aspire-they smother all disposition for so-
      cial amendment, and thus both directly and [indi-]
     rectly keep up and increase the improvidence [and]
      indifference of the labourer[.] The establishment
     of a middle class between them would be exceed-
      "If the manufacturer kept this shop merely for the pur-
      pose of securing good articles, at fair prices to his workmen,
      and if he offered no inducement to them to purchase at his
      shop, except the superior cheapness of his articles, it would
      certainly be advantageous to the men. But, unfortunately, this
      is not always the case.-Babbage, p. 309.

    ingly beneficial to the character of both, -to the
   man by shewing within his reach a condition in
    life elevated above that which he now holds - to
   the master by establishing a barrier which would
    separate him for troublesomely and vexatiously
    interfering with the details of his inferior.
     Another system rapidly progressing, and very
   much resembling the truck system[,][ of][ which][ in]
    fact it may be viewed as an[ off][ set][,][ is] [the][ cottage]
    system . A master having in his employ [several]
   hundred hands, whose habitations are [scattered][ at]
    considerable distances from each other and from
    the mill , erects ranges of cottages [in][ its][ immediate]
    vicinity, forming a part indeed of itself[.] These
    cottages are probably better built[,] more commo-
    dious, in every respect more comfortable than
    those which the labourers [previously][ inhabited][ ;]
   by bringing them nearer their work, they [escape]
    exposure to the weather in their progress [to][ and]
    from their work ; they have also an [opportunity]
    of securing longer hours of rest by the [saving][ of]
    time which was occupied by these progresses ;
    and yet the system is a bad one[,] and one decidedly
    injurious to the men. This system of cottage
    building, it is true, is not universal in the towns
    where masses of labourers are already [collected][ ,]
    and when considerable expence would [attend][ upon]
     it, it is very little practised. It is chiefly in the
    out-districts, and it is a striking proof [of the][ ad-]
    vantages to the master, that the great manufac-

```

```
      turers are gradually creeping to the outskirts or
      into localities a few miles from the great towns .
      The extension and influence of this system may
     be very distinctly seen in the now populous town-
      ship of Hyde and Newton, Duckenfield, & c. about
     seven miles from Manchester, and three from
     Ashton.
      The population of these districts in 1801 ,
      scarcely amounted to three thousand, whilst in
     1830 it had increased to twenty-six thousand
     nearly, a rate of increase unequalled . The rapid
     growth of such a population in this neighbour-
     hood, is of course owing to the concentration of a
     number of manufactories here, favoured as their
      position is by an abundant supply of coal and ex-
      cellent means of transport. This population
     which is the resident one, by no means indicates
     the number of hands employed, on the contrary,
     great numbers are furnished by the surrounding
     townships .
     An examination of the habitations of this popu-
      lation would show how very large a proportion is
     in the hands of the manufacturers, either as
     owners, or general tenants . It may be urged,
     that the masters in consequence of the increase in
     the number of miles , and the consequent difficulty
      •
     of collecting hands from a ' distance, have been
     forced to build, nobody else indeed being found
     who would speculate upon such property. This
      is very true, and quite unanswerable . They have

```

-----

```
    been forced to build, and are still building ; but it
    does not lessen the evils attendant upon it.
    The demoralizing effects of crowding together
    promiscuously the labourers in factories, have in
    large towns been materially aided by the nature of
    their habits and the vices which large towns
    afford facilities for pursuing. So long asas the the ope-
    rative, after having completed his day's toil , was
    seperated from his fellows, and had to seek his
    isolated cottage , some of these evils were avoided .
    It freed him for a time at least from bad example,
    removed him from immediate contact with the
    gin-shop or tavern , collected his family generally
    under one roof, and gave him an opportunity for
    cultivating his social affections , and keeping down
    the overwhelming force of demoralization , which
    too often destroyed the town labourer. By afford-
    ing him the cheering influences of a pure atmos-
    phere, the sights and sounds of natural objects,
    the out- district labourer presented for a time some
    moral and physical traits, which made him supe-
    rior to the town operative.
     The Beer Act has unhappily destroyed one of
    these advantages . The race of keepers of public-
    houses in the rural districts, was, generally speak-
    ing, one something superior to his immediate
    neighbours * a small farmer or shopkeeper, and
    reputable householder. Since that period, how-
    ever, a great change has been working in the
            * Vide Introductory sketch .

     licensed victuallers . The small sum required for
     a license, threw it open to a labourer, and the idle
     and profligate took immediate advantage of it.
    Numbers of beer-houses were speedily seen occu-
     pying sites, where as a matter of trade, very little
     advantage could be derived from them . Every
     way-side, every clump of cottages, shewed, as it
     was termed here, its " Tom and Jerry shop, " a
     term singularly appropriate . It cannot be denied,
     that prior to the introduction of these, an organ-
     ized system for evading the excise laws was deve-
     loping itself, in a very singular, and yet in a very
      effective form . The public -houses at this period ,
     (prior to the passing of the Beer Act) it has been
     said, was a house of good report, where, though
     immorality and drunkenness would at times shew
     themselves, still they were checked and kept in
     some sort of discipline . The bringing together
     numbers of the young of both sexes by the factory
     system , generated irregularities, which had no ade-
     quate field for their display ; drinking became
     more habitual, and the more it was indulged, the
     more it required indulgence . To meet this de-
     mand of demoralization , a number of houses were
     opened in the vicinity of the manufactories, termed
    " whistling-shops" or " straw-houses," for the sale
     of beer, which however, as the parties were unli-
     censed, subjected them to a penalty. To evade
      this , no beer was sold, but abundance was given.
    The mode in which this transfer was managed, to
     the advantage and compensation of the giver, was,

```

-----

```
   that a straw was the matter in barter ; the drinker
   bought a bit of straw for the price of a pint of beer,
   and this pint was given in with the bargain . Odd
   as this may seem, it was carried on very exten-
   siuely, and exists yet to some degree, though it
   has been displaced partially by the opening of beer-
   houses, which cost little, and free their owners
   or occupiers from the risk of punishment. By
   lowering the value of public-house property, and
   by lowering in an equal degree the character of
   the holders of these houses, great moral injury has
   been done, without one single advantage to the
   poor man to compensate for it. It was a law based
   upon most erroneous and mistaken principles-
   holding out to the labourer an apparent addition to
   his comfort, but which has signally and unhappily
   failed .
    The advantages possessed by the operative living
   in a detached situation , were counterbalanced in
   some degree, by the increased labour, which, if he
   lived two or three miles away from the mill-a
   very common distance, he necessarily underwent,
   and by consequent exposures from a heated atmo-
   sphere to a natural temperature in unfavourahle
   weather, and by the necessity for early rising and
    late going to bed. When however, the distance
   was more limited, he derived benefit from the
   change of exercise , night and morning, but was
   prevented going home to dinner. The advantages
   of most importance were morals , and these he loses
   by being brought under the cottage system .

```

```
      The masters, many of whom have 80 , 100, 200 ,
      or more of those cottages surrounding, or in the
      immediate neighbourhood of their mills , are im-
     mense gainers by the arrangement. The cost of
      building a range of houses such as these, say 100 ,
      will not, upon the most liberal average, be more
      than 5,000l.; indeed it may be estimated at vastly
      less ; for the generality of them - taking the very
      best, 501. per house will over and above cover the
      outlay. Now for the outlay of 5,000l. , the capi-
       talist draws an annual income of 800%. , or 13 per
      cent ., and completely covers himself in little more
      than six years. This profitable return is burdened
      with no drawback, no rent is lost, every pay-night
       it is deducted from the wages . One cannot won-
      der therefore, at the universal practice of manu-
      facturers building cottages, favourably placed as
      they are. Besides this disproportionate rate of
      interest, he derives other great advantages from
      thus congregating his men under his immediate
      controul. In the first place, it enables him without
        • difficulty to perpetuate the truck system : for he
      invariably builds two or three shops, and houses
      calculated for taverns or beer-houses ; and if he
      has no direct dealing in them, he abstracts an equi-
      valent rent ; and his hands are expected —and do
      spend a considerable portion of their earnings
      there, so that they suffer precisely the same injury

   meals -to begin earlier in the morning, to continue
    later at night -and this too with the concurrence
   of the hands, who often do not understand the dif
   ference sufficiently between mill labour and walking
   on the road in the open air ; and yield up an hour
   at least per diem, which is added to the profits of
   the cottage building.
     It is argued by those who advocate the system,
   that there are many circumstances favourable to
   the men in it -- that generally a school-house is 4
   built, and every disposition shown by the master,
   to forward the comfort and domestic enjoyments
   of the men. That the houses are commodious,
   clean, whitewashed, and in every respect vastly
   superior to the habitations for a similar class of
   labourers in the town . Any one who will take
   the trouble to inspect them, will at once acknow-
   ledge the truth of these assertions ; but in opposi-
   tion, it must be born in mind, that all these advan-
   tages in the domestic condition of the hands, are
   sources of large pecuniary profit to the master, at
   their expense. It is said the rent, 3s. per week, is
   not more than the tenant would have to pay for a
   cottage as near the mill, to any other landlord .
   This is not denied- but the argument is unfair.
   The landlord who has cottage poperty, charges pro-
   bably the same per-centage in towns and populous
   neighbourhoods : but he is liable to loss of rent
   continually to have his houses empty for weeks
   and months together-to have his tenants leaving
   his houses , almost in a state of dilapidation . &c. & c.

     so that, although he has the same nominal rent,
    and is so far on a par with the manufacturer, he
    seldom calculates upon receiving, or ever does
     receive, on an average more than six per cent. , at
     the utmost- rarely indeed so much. It is, there-
     fore, obviously and clearly a misnomer, to say that
    the one derives the same profit as the other ;
     whereas the manufacturer receives without risk or
     trouble, or even collecting, 13 per cent : whilst
     the common capitalist has very considerable diffi-
     culty in securing his five or six per cent ; and that
     has to be waited for and got together with inces-
     sant exertion.
       It would be highly gratifying if the masters[,] in
     extending this system, which might have been the
     agent of much good to the men-had not shown
     their rapacity so plainlyplainly.. Had they contented
     themselves with fair interest, and accommodated
     their hands with these cottages, it would have
     been well- it would have been gratifying to every
     one, desirous of seeing a change in the intercourse
     between them . They might have, indeed , con-
     tented themselves with even a less amount of in-
     terest than that paid by building property in
     general, and still have been gainers[,] by having the
     opportunity of lengthening in a very limited de-
     gree, the hours of labour, and by many other
     incidental advantages which they gain, by bringing
     the men in such immediate contact with the [mill][.]

   system, with all its vices, it can neither improve
   the condition of the labourer, nor add to the
   honourable name of the master.
    The truck system and the cottage system are
   both departures from the proper track and duties
   of the master- both bring him into collision with
    his men, upon points on which he ought never to
    interfere. His duties are so strongly marked that
   he should never suffer a question which can,
    for a moment, in any way make him diverge from
    their proper performance, to be entertained . He
   has a large capital employed, and for the purpose
   of turning it to profitable account , he requires the
    assistance of a certain number of labourers , the
   expense of the hiring of which is added to the cost
   of the peculiar manufacture he brings into the
   market. This payment of labour should be of that
    extent, and no farther, as will enable him to com-
    pete with other traders ; and should be greater
   and smaller as the article he produces sells at
    greater or less price than all the expenses of its
    production, such as raw material, building, ma-
    chinery, labourers , &c . leaving to the speculator,
    or producer, a fair profit for time and capital ex-
   pended. This constitutes the profit of the manu-
    facturer ; and this done , he is bound to pay his
    labourers in money, their part ofthe expense ofpro-
    duction- namely for their labour. But the truck
    system and the cottage system go beyond this .
   The master pays or gives an acknowledgment to
   the men for their quota of profit, which he de-

      One mode in which these systems are prejudi-
      cial to the interests of the workmen is , that it
     gives the masters an opportunity of lowering their
     wages in times of trade depression , or at their own
     caprice, and that too in an underhand way, which
     they can with difficulty resist. Sixpence a week
     in addition to the rent of their houses, and a half-
     penny or farthing a pound or yard on the articles
     of their consumption, are innovations not so great
     as to arouse their attention or indignation ; but it
     gives a large sum to the masters, and the tempta-
     tion thus held out is too great to be resisted .
     Hence a series of frauds upon the men-for frauds
     they decidedly are, of the most injurious tendency.
     A manufacturer employs 600 hands, the entire
     sum of whose wages for six months, at an average
     of ten shillings per head, is 7,8007. This he pays
     as the value of their labour, after having allowed
     for every other item, and his own profit. If his
     men are subjected to the truck and cottage system
     (and remember the first amount, which he declares
      is one left to his own conscience, and is not im-
     probably much below its fair value) , he levies upon
     their capital a tax of nearly 500l. , and this over
     and above the customary profits made upon the

```

```
   articles with which he supplies them, namely,
   houses and goods, and all this without risk.
    It has been previously urged that combinations
   of the masters are needful and desirable when
   founded upon justice and equity, but this monstrous
   perversion of both cannot be sufficiently con-
   demned .
    The capabilities which the labouring man has to
   improve his condition under the numerous disad-
   vantages to which he is subjected , cannot receive
   a more striking exemplification than from the fact,
   that the hands who , in addition to their other disad-
   vantages, are farther subjected to those of these
   two systems, are in many respeets decidedly im-
   proved in their social and moral organization, and
   nothing can shew more clearly what might be done
   by masters , than what interest based upon injustice
   has led them to .
    This injustice comes with double force upon the
   operative, as it injures him indirectly, and in a way
   which he does not understand, and in a way, too,
   that he cannot resist . He perhaps does not feel
   its operation so onerous as in reality it is, and
   struggles on complaining against a rate of wages,
   which is hardly adequate for his wants and ex-
   pectations- combining, too , against them, paying a
   further sum on this account, while the actual cause
   of his misfortunes lies shrouded and covered by so
   specious a show, that he never dreams of imputing
   them to it.
    All the relations between master and man should

     be clearly understood --they are simple when freed
     from suspicions on the one hand, and grasping
     avarice on the other. Their compact is one for
     the interest of both, if they will properly cultivate
      it ; and too much tenacity in clinging to supposed
      rights or immunities is injurious to all parties. The
     labourer has a positive right to the market value of
      his labour, whether more or less , whether sufficient
      or insufficient to support him ; and the master ought
     to give such explanation as will satisfy him that he
     has such value, and neither should go beyond this.
     The labourer should not interfere with the regula-
      tions of his master , nor should the master interfere
     with the free agency of the labourer . Each have
      their proper functions, and like the members of
     the human body in the well-known fable, if they
      quarrel, they will most assuredly suffer .
      The moral evils of the truck and cottage systems
     are analogous . By reducing the labourer to a
     mere machine-by destroying his personal inde-
     pendence-by cutting off his claim to self-respect
     -they degrade him to a condition of mere slavery,
     compared to which the West Indian slave may
     indeed congratulate himself on his good fortune,
      for his is a state to be a thousand-fold desired in
     preference. The name of slave is a bye-word for
     conjuring up a frightful catalogue of miseries and
     degradations ; but the slave has no master like the
     steam engine, none which requires such assiduous ,
     such untiring attention . He is not compelled by
      this inexorable tyrant to toil for twelve or four-

   bered that the factory labourer works in an atmo-
   sphere of equal temperature with the slave-and
   shall a name make such mighty difference ? When
   the moral and physical conditions of slavery are
   equally in force in both instances ? for so it is when
   the master takes under his controul the hard won
   wages of his labourers , and again converts them to
   his own use, leaving them to suffer any degree of
   hardship which will not drive them to desperation .
    They both necessarily render the men improvi-
   dent and reckless- destroy all forethought- pa-
   ralyze every better feeling within them- and thus
   brutalize and degrade them in exact ratio as they
   are made dependant and hopeless of amelioration
   or amendment.
    It is hardly possible that the masters will ever
   sufficiently comprehend , that to make money is an
   evil, or that they will possess such honourable feel-
   ings as will lead them to sacrifice a positive ad-
   vantage over the men, when it is entirely in their
   power. Even were it so- even were masters dis-
   posed to consult these things , it is not likely
   the world, or at all events their men, would give
   them credit for it. Let them, therefore , wash
   their hands of all temptation ; let them shew, by
   not having, that they do not wish to have unfair
   advantages ; and though they may lose something
   for a time, they will eventually be large gainers ;

     wages greatly inferior to what they now contrive
      to squander, and yet starve-to labour incessantly,
     yet seem to labour for a pittance unequal to supply
      their wants . It is indeed difficult to say what is the

     who will inquire, that an amount of earning which
      appears to one family totally inadequate to live
     even decently with, when all about is squalid beg-
      gary, and everything shews the extremity of want
     -yet that another family, equally, if not more
     numerous , will , with the same amount of wages,
      appear clean, well fed, well clothed , cheerful, and
     happy. It is not in the amount of a man's earning ,
      so much as to his capability of turning this to the
      best account. Great wealth is no safeguard against
      occasional distress, if not properly economized and
     managed ; neither are liberal wages any reason why
      those earning them should not be pauperized . The
     same family, to the present writer's positve know-
     ledge, has at one period earned £5 per week.
     Trade has become depressed - prices have fallen—
     and in a year or two their earnings have been re-
     duced to £2 10s . But were they poorer ? By no

     comparison . Were they worse dressed ? No !

    gularly, and they were, in every respect, as well

     it will be, if the manufacturing population can be

    make home what it should be ; if the earnings of
    families are brought into a joint fund ; if domestic
    discipline is re- established ; and if they become
    good husbands , fathers, brothers, and wives ; if
    they will limit the demands of their appetites to

    to defer, or perhaps do away with the chance of
    the frightful consummation of their misfortunes,
