        PREFACE .
    THE entire absence of a work like the
   present, has long been felt as a serious evil .
   Nothing whatever in the shape of information
    is to be found , except a few pamphlets , the
   productions of party warmth , or of a school
   of political economy , the dogmas of which are
   open to insuperable objections ; whilst the
   vast importance of the subject itself, and the
   numerous interests connected with it , render
    it highly desirable that it should be carefully
   examined and dispassionately considered , —
   and that a book should be the result to which
    all parties may look with confidence , and
   that which the general reader may turn to
   for accurate information .
     It is very true that committees of the House
   of Commons, have at different periods exa-
   mined into some of the points of this inquiry .
                B

```
     It has however unfortunately happened that
     the evidence given before them [,] and the re-
     ports founded upon that evidence , are looked
     at suspiciously, and have in effect no weight
     or consideration . This has arisen , partly from
     the peculiar nature of the evidence[,] which [too]
     often is tinged so strongly with party [spirit][,]
     that it subjects itself at once to doubt [or][ total]
     unbelief ; and partly to the want ofknowledge
     amongst the members ofthe committee [,] which
     prevented them applying such questions and
     trains of reasoning and deductions , as the
     actual condition of the subject demanded .
     Hence , though many valuable facts have been
      elicited by these inquiries , they are in such
     a crude form, as to be entirely valueless [.]
      Connected in no way with manufactures ,
     not having the slightest interest in the[ exist-]
     ence or non-existence of any particular order
     of things, the Author trusts he [shall] [supply] a
     desideratum in literature, and at a juncture ,
     when men's minds are excited upon the
     subject , which is but just beginning to have
     that attention paid it, that its magnitude and
     overwhelming value demand . In the prose-
     cution of his work he has studiously confined
     himself to data, generally the results of exten-
     sive personal research and inquiry, or ob-

   tained from documents worthy of implicit
    belief.
    The questions of infant labour, the effects
   of factory labour in general, the physical con-
   dition and peculiar diseases of the labourers,
   have been treated plainly and succinctly, upon
   considerations drawn from the known consti-
   tution of the human body, and the conse-
   quences produced by various external agencies
   upon its healthy functions . They have been
   discussed with strict impartiality, and freed
   from the misrepresentations and gross exag-
   gerations which have hitherto involved them.
    The moral, social, and domestic relations of
   the immense portion of the productive popu-
   lation of the kingdom, now engaged in manu-
   factures , present a picture, as strange and
   as deeply interesting, as any in the whole
   circle of the history of mankind . To the phi-
   lanthropist to the man anxious for the well-
   being and social happiness of his species- it is
   one calculated to fill the mind with sorrow
   and fear. It has been little attended to, and
    still less understood . Remedies are wanted-
   are loudly called for ; but, before they can be
   efficiently applied , the disease must be stu-
   died ; mere empiricism , even when founded
   on the purest motives, is dangerous ; and when

     the interest and happiness of a multitude are
     at stake , a clear and distinct understanding of
      its wants and failings should precede any at-
     tempt to satisfy the one or rectify the other.
      In developing the existing state of things ,
     with respect to combinations , the truck sys-
     tem , and the cottage system, many important
     truths are brought into full daylight, unper-
     verted in their bearings by the mistaken ideas
     or disingenuousness, sometimes of one party ,
     sometimes of another, which have invariably
     distorted, or partially concealed them , as best
     suited their peculiar purposes . A strenuous
     effort too has been made to demonstrate satis-
     factorily, how much mischief is arising and
     has arisen from a division of interest, and
     want of mutual co-operation between the
     masters and the men .
      In the statistical divisions of this work , the
     Author has done all that a man can do with
     the subject and he can add his mite of vexa-
     tion to that of others who have been engaged
     in similar inquiries . The utter want of any
     thing approaching to correct registration , is
     one of the severest drawbacks to those who
     are wishful to verify their positions by refer-
     ences to figures. All that the utmost industry
     can expect to attain , is but an approximation

    to accuracy, and it may be questioned whether
    it is not safer to rely upon deductions drawn
    from other and better authenticated sources
    of knowledge. The difficulty in these respects
     is increased a hundred-fold in manufacturing
    districts, the population of which is undergo-
    ing such incessant changes, quite independent
    of the operation of natural events, and in
    which too the separatists from the Established
    Church, constitute the numerical majority .
   Many of these keep no registries whatever ;
    and in all so much laxity and uncertainty
    prevail, that they are worse than useless as
    documentary evidence . The immigration of
    families from the surrounding parishes is ano-
    ther difficulty, as it generally happens that an
    individual who has removed not too far from
    the grave of his fathers, is carried away after
    death, to repose in the same quiet nook, re-
    mote from the turmoil and bustle which have
   made his heart yearn for a green and sunny
    resting place.
     The little amount of written information on
    all these subjects , is very extraordinary , espe-
    cially when it is borne in mind how large a
    proportion of the national wealth , and of the
    entire population , are involved in them . This
   may perhaps have arisen from the circum-

    stance of the existing pre-eminence of manu-
    facturers , being but the growth of a day—
    being as yet but a Hercules in the cradle .
    It is indeed only since the introduction of
      1
    steam as a power, that they have acquired
    their paramount importance ; one generation
    even now is but passing away since this epoch ,
    and what mighty alterations has it already
    wrought in the condition of society - chang-
    ing in many respects the very frame-work of
    the social confederacy , and opening into view
    a long vista of rapid transitions , terminating
    in the subjection of human power, as an agent
    of labour, to its gigantic and untiring ener-
    gies
      It is high time that the erroneous opinions
    currently entertained on many points con-
    nected with factory discipline and factory
    labour should be removed ; and that the feel-
    ings ofsympathy and needless commisseration ,
    expressed by certain portions of the commu-
    nity, should be directed into a more legiti-
    mate and less harmful channel . One great
    cause of the unhappy differences which have
    so completely sundered the confidence of the
    employers and the employed , had its origin in
    the want ofdiffusion of correct knowledge. Nei-
    ther have the masters at all times shewn that

   their opinions were trustworthy . But it has
   been the men who have chiefly erred , and

   They have suffered their better judgments to

    The causes which have led to the present

   labourer, earn what is amply sufficient to sup-
   ply all their wants, with the exception of one
   particular class , the hand-loom weavers : it
    is not factory labour, considered per se ; it is
   not the lack of education , in the common
   acceptation of the word : -no ; it has arisen
   from the separation of families , the breaking
   up of households , the disruption of all those
    ties which link man's heart to the better
   portion of his nature , viz . his instincts and

    The deductions and statements in this work ,

    five-ninths of the whole population engaged

        It is much to be wished that " men in high
      places " would examine, somewhat more in
      detail, the existing condition of the manufac-
      turers . The conversion of a great people, in
       little more than the quarter of a century,
      from agriculturists to manufacturers , is a
     phenomenon worthy the attention of any
      statesman. It is an attention, too, which
      will be forced upon them, when , from their
     want of knowledge, they will be liable to take
      steps which may prove destructive to one or
     both of the great divisions of national pro-
      perty. The change, too , which has recently
     been made in the constitution of the House
     of Commons, is another important reason
     why information should be extended widely
     and generally. The change is one, indeed,
      characteristic ofthe times ; and the introduc-
      tion to the House of persons of strictly com-
      mercial habits and views, will necessarily
      operate very powerfully upon the course of

   wealthy nation , are pouring into the tide of
   manufactures, and swelling its ascendency ;
   and it must soon become in appearance, what
   it is in reality, the directing current of the
   national prosperity . From the utter absence
   of information , it is to be feared that crude
   and badly digested enactments may inter-
   fere between the employer and the employed,

   the ultimate endangering of the present lofty

     It is , above all things, of importance that

   fully and maturely considered . Though dan-
   ger may arise from legislative enactments ,

     hand , and steam aided by machinery , which
      is constantly improving in construction , and
     increasing in applicability , is approaching a
      crisis, the termination of which it is frightful
     to contemplate . The contest has hitherto
     been, between the vast body of hand-loom
     weavers , who have clung to their ancient
     habits, till no market is open to their labour ;
     but it is now commencing between another
     great body and machinery . The adaptation
     of mechanical contrivances to nearly all the
     processes which have as yet wanted the deli-
     cate tact of the human hand, will soon either
     do away with the necessity for employing it,
     or it must be employed at a price that will
     enable it to compete with mechanism . This
     cannot be : human power must ever be an ex-
     pensive power ; it cannot be carried beyond a
     certain point, neither will it permit a depres-
     sion of payment below what is essential for
      its existence, and it is the fixing of this
     minimum in which lies the difficulty .
       It may indeed be questioned how [far] [the]
     interference of Government in [questions] of
      this nature is likely to prove beneficial[ ,][ and]
     whether the parties , the masters on the one

  of France once said to Colbert , when it was pro-
  posed to take measures of protection for their
   interests " Laissez nous faire," let us alone,
  we shall take care of ourselves . One thing is
  becoming daily more and more obvious, and
   this is , that the agriculturist in the long run
  has had but little reason to be grateful for the
   protection which has been thrown over him,
  not unfrequently at the expense of other in-
   terests . It would be well if the manufacturers
  would take a lesson from them . The majo-
   rity of representation has hitherto been con-
   nected with landed property, and this has
   enabled the farmer to cover himself with pro-
   tecting duties, and he has availed himself of
   it to the utmost . A single glance at his pre-
   sent condition will clearly show how illusory,
  how fallacious has been his factitious prospe-
   rity, and that the time is come when he feels
  howmiserably all his hopes have been blighted .
  " Laissez nous faire " should be the maxim of
   the manufacturer, or the time will also come
  when he will bitterly repent his clamour for
   legislative protection .

      home market. At this period , and down to 1800 ,
      during which interval, a general impetus had been
      given to this branch of trade by foreign and in-
      creased home consumption-and in which, also,
      great improvements had taken place in the con-
      struction of the machines, all tending to facilitate
      and hasten production-the majority of the arti-
      zans engaged in them had laboured in their own
      houses, and in the bosoms of their families . It
     may be termed the period of domestic manufac-
      ture ; and the various mechanical contrivances
      were expressly framed for this purpose . The
      distaff, the spinning wheel, producing a single
      thread, and , subsequently the mule and jenny,
     were to be found forming a part of the comple-
     ment of household furniture , in almost every
      house of the districts in which they were carried
     on, whilst the cottage every where resounded with
      the clack of the hand-loom
       These were, undoubtedly, the golden times of
      manufactures , considered in reference to the cha-
      racter of the labourers . By all the processes
      being carried on under a man's own roof, he re-
      tained his individual respectability ; he was kept
      apart from associations that might injure his
      moral worth , whilst he generally earned wages
     which were sufficient not only to live comfortably
     upon, but which enabled him to rent a few
      acres of land ; thus joining in his own person
     two classes, that are now daily becoming more
     and more distinct. It cannot , indeed , be denied ,

```

    that his farming was too often slovenly, and was
    conducted at times but as a subordinate occupa-
    tion ; and that the land yielded but a small
    proportion of what, under a better system of
    culture , it was capable of producing. It never-
    theless answered an excellent purpose . Its neces-
    sary tendence filled up the vacant hours , when he
    found it unnecessary to apply himself to his loom
    or spinning machine . It gave him employment of
    a healthy nature , and raised him a step in the
    scale of society above the mere labourer . A gar-
    den was likewise an invariable adjunct to the
    cottage of the hand-loom weaver ; and in no part
    of the kingdom were the floral tribes , fruits , and
    edible roots, more zealously or more successfully
    cultivated .
    The domestic manufacturers generally resided
    in the outskirts of the large towns , or at still more
    remote distances . Themselves cultivators , and
    of simple habits and few wants , the uses of tea,
    coffee, and groceries in general, but little known ,
    they rarely left their own homestead . The yarn
    which they spun , and which was wanted by the
   weaver, was received or delivered , as the case
   might be, by agents , who travelled for the whole-
    sale houses ; or depôts were established in parti-
    cular neighbourhoods , to which he could apply at
   weekly periods . Grey-haired men-fathers of
    large families , have thus lived through a long
    life, which has been devoted to spinning or weav-
    ing, and have never entered the precincts of a

    in their means of support, they have gone there ,
     for the first time , when forced to migrate with
     their households , in search of occupation at steam-
    looms.
     Thus, removed from many of those causes
    which universally operate to the deterioration of
    the moral character of the labouring man , when
     brought into large towns- into immediate contact
    and communion with his fellows , and under the
     influence of many depressing physical agencies-
     the small farmer , spinner , or hand-loom weaver,
     presented as orderly and respectable an appear-
     ance as could be wished . It is true that the
    amount of labour gone through, was but small ;
     that the quantity of cloth or yarn produced was
     but limited- for he worked by the rule of his
     strength and convenience . They were , however,
     sufficient to clothe and feed himself and family
     decently, and according to their station ; to lay
    by a penny for an evil day, and to enjoy those
     amusements and bodily recreations then in being.

     and impure atmosphere, the fumes of the gin-

    shop, the low debauchery of the beer-house, and
    the miseries incident to ruined health . On the
    contrary, he commonly lived to a good round age,
    worked when necessity demanded , ceased his
    labour when his wants were supplied , according
    to his character, and if disposed to spend time or
    money in drinking , could do so in a house as well
    conducted and as orderly as his own ; for the
    modern weaver or spinner differs not more widely
    from the domestic manufacturer, than the publi-
    can ofthe present day, differs from the Boniface of
     that period , whose reputation depended upon
    good ale and good hours, and who , in nine cases
    out of ten, was a freeholder of some consequence
    in the neighbourhood .
     The circumstance of a man's labour being con-
    ducted in the midst of his household , exercised a
    powerful influence upon his social affections , and
    those of his offspring . It but rarely happened that
    labour was prematurely imposed upon these ; ——
     his own earnings, aided by the domestic econo-
   my of his wife, generally sufficing to permit
    growth and bodily development to be, to some
    extent, completed, before any demand was made
    upon their physical energies . This permitted and
    fostered the establishment of parental authority
    and domestic discipline . It directed the child's
    thoughts and attachments to their legitimate ob-
    jects , and rendered it submissive to that control
    which is essential to its future welfare . When it
    was enabled to join its exertions to those of its

      parent for their mutual support, it did so with no
      idea of separate interests , but with a free acknow-
      ledgment that the amount of its earnings was en-
      tirely at the disposal of the head of the family.
     Thus remaining and labouring in conjunction with ,
      and under the eye of, its parents , till manhood
      and womanhood were respectively attained , it ac-
      quired habits of domestication , exceedingly fa-
      vourable to its subsequent progress through life ;
     home being, to the poor man, the very temple of
      fortune, in which he may contrive, if his earnings
      are not scanty indeed , to live with comfort and
      independence .
       In this respect, the child of the domestic ma-
      nufacturer was advantageously placed . It re-
     mained under its paternal roof during the period
      in which puberty was developed ; its passions and
      social instincts were properly cultivated , its bo-
      dily powers were not too early called into requi-
      sition, it had the benefit of green fields , a pure at-
     mosphere, the cheering influences of nature , and
       its diet was plain and substantial . Under these
      auspicious circumstances it grew vigorously, ac-
      quired a healthy tone of system , the various parts
      of its physical organization were well compacted
      and arranged , and it presented an aspect fresh
     and blooming, speaking of animal energy and
      vital activity, and evincing that with it every thing
     went well, and that it enjoyed and profited by
     them .

     guarantees for the performance of the relative du-
      ties of all classes, were at this time in full force ;
     and the ' Squire , ' as the chief landed proprietor
     was generally termed, obtained and deserved his
     importance from his large possessions , low rents ,
     and a simplicity and homeliness of bearing which ,
     when joined to acknowledged family honours , made
     him loved and reverenced by his tenants and neigh-
     bours. He mingled freely with their sports-
     was the general and undisputed arbitrator in all
     questions of law and equity- was a considerate
     and generous landlord --a kind and indulgent mas-
      ter-and looking at him in all his bearings , a
     worthy and amiable man ; tinged , it is true , with
     some vices , but all so coated over with wide-
     spreading charity, that the historian willingly
     drawsthe veil offorgetfulness over them . This race
     of men is now nearly extinct in the manufactur-
     ing districts. Their possessions are passed into
     new hands- their descendants " pushed from their
      stools" by an order of men having few or no traits in
     common with them . They indeed belonged to a
     race indigenous to a peculiar grade of social ad-
     vancement, no longer in being. With them, for
     they were equally a part of the same system , the
     " Yeomanry of England ;" the small farmers have
      fallen victims to the breaking up of a condition
     of society, and a state of property, which secured a
      flourishing rural population . The few old relics of
     the squirearchy which are still now and then to be
     found in these districts , are but mementos of a

       race gone by- are like the scathed oak of another
       generation , withering in the midst of a thriving
      and usurping plantation , which has derived its
       birth and part of its sustenance from its decay, and
      which is rapidly sinking or already sunk below
       the level of the mass that surrounds it.
        Modern intellectual utilitarians measure men's
       actions, and every thing referring to his condition ,
      by mere mind . That state of things is, however,
      the best which brings to each man's fireside the
       greatest amount of domestic comforts , though it
      may not be that which will enable him to boil his
       pot scientifically, or calculate an abstruse problem
       in mathematics . It is not denied , neither is it
      wished to conceal the fact from observation , that
       squire, yeoman, and manufacturer differed very
       materially in some of these respects from the in-
       dividuals occupying a correspondent rank at the
      present period, and that the latter, when looked
      upon in this point of view, are infinitely superior
      to the former. Neither in comparing the two is
      there any intention of wishing that the state of
       society should be again taken back to that parti-
       cular level in the onward progress of civilization .
       It would be vain and childish to do so . The for-
      ward impulse must and will be obeyed , whatever
      the consequences may be to the welfare and hap-
      piness of the labouring community. On the one
      hand may be seen a daily spread of knowledge,
      joined to a gradual depression in the scale of so-
       cial enjoyments ; vast and incessant improvements

     in mechanical contrivances , all tending to over-
     match and supersede human labour, and which
     threatens, ere long , to extirpate the very demand
     for it ; a system of toil continued unbroken by rest
     or relaxation , for fourteen or sixteen hours , in a
     heated and crowded mill , and an utter destruction
     of all social and domestic relations ; on the other
     hand, a calm and equable flow of occupation , al-
     ternating between the loom and the greensward-
     an intelligence seldom looking beyond present
     means—an ignorance of nearly every but the
     most common arts of life- a knowledge chiefly tra-
     ditional a proper station inthe social arrangement,
     a demand for labour full as great, if not greater
     than the existing supply - a rate of wage quite
     equivalent to the simplicity and limited range of
     their wants , and all the social and domestic relations
     in full force , and properly directed . The great
     question here is the measure of social and domes-
      tic happiness , for these are but synonymes of
     social virtue . They co -exist and have an inti-
     mate dependence one upon another . Degradation
     in these conditions will ever be simultaneous with
     moral declension-a declension incompatible with
     the performance of a great majority of man's best.
     and most sacred duties.
      If the comfort of the poor man is to be esti-
     mated by variety of wants , by his living in an
      artificial state of society , surrounded by all the
     inventions resulting from a high degree of civili-

      every facility afforded him for procuring them..--
      the aboriginal and home manufacturer sinks very
      low when compared with the present race. If, on
      the contrary, comfort and domestic happiness
      are to be judged by the fewness of a man's
      wants , with the capability of securing the means
       for their supply, the tables are turned in favour
      of the domestic manufacturer. If the comfort
      of these states of society is to be calculated upon
      another ground--namely, the nature of their
      separate wants and habits --it brings into light
      very striking contrasts . The present manufacturer
      shows a high order of intelligence , seeking its
      amusement in the newspaper, the club , the poli-
       tical union , the lecture room ; looking for its
      stimulus in the gin and beer shops ; for its sup-
      port a limited supply of animal food , once a day,
      joined with copious dilution of weak tea, the
      almost universal concomitant of the spinner and
      weaver's breakfast and evening meal, in many
      cases indeed being nearly its sole constituent ;
      debarred from all athletic sports, or rather not
      having a moment's time to seek , or a bodily
      vigour capable of undertaking them ; an active
      mind in a stunted and bloodless body ; a sepa-
       ration of the labourer from his family during the
      whole day, and a consequent disruption of all
       social ties , and this too joined to a similar separa-
      tion amongst the various members of his house-
      hold . The domestic manufacturer possessed a
      very limited degree of information ; his amuse

   ments were exclusively sought in bodily exercise ,
   the dance , quoits , cricket, the chace, the numerous
   seasonal celebrations , &c .; an utter ignorance of
    printed books, beyond the thumbed Bible and a
   few theological tracts ; seeking his stimulus in
   home-brewed ale ; having for his support animal
   food occasionally, but living generally upon farm
   produce, meal or rye bread, eggs, cheese , milk,
    butter, &c. ; * the use of tea quite unknown , or
    * The sturdy opposition given to the introduction of tea, by
    many of the class of yeomen, is strikingly illustrated by an
    anecdote connected with an ancestor of the author. This man,
    a respectable landowner and tanner, had, like many others, a
    wife strongly disposed to have her own way . When the use
    of tea first became general, she procured a set of the fairy tea-
    cups and huge silver tea-spoons then in vogue, and got some
    tea. Many and serious altercations took place between the
    worthy couple in consequence ; the husband steadily refusing
    what he emphatically denominated stuff, and threatening once
    and again to demolish the whole paraphernalia if she persisted in
    bringing it into daylight. However, the good woman and one
    or two of her neighbours had made the notable discovery that
     it was a beverage singularly fitted to sit and gossip over. On
    one particular day the husband had been more than usually
    furious, and she thought it prudent to beat a partial retreat,
    but by no means to give up the matter. She was for effecting
    this by expediting the hour of tea- drinking, so that all should
    be over before he came to his evening meal. It so happened
    that on this precise day, she had with her one of her gossips ;
    and during their tea-drinking, by some unlucky chance,
    Thomas, for such was his name, was heard clattering his thick-
     soled shoes over the rough pavement before the door, and evi-
    dently coming in. All was hurry to conceal her disobedience
    to his express commands, and this they believed they had
     effectually compassed by thrusting tray and tea-things upon a
     stair-head leading to a sort of lumber room, a place which he
    seldom visited . As fate would have it, he entered and bent

      parent for their mutual support , it did so with no
      idea of separate interests , but with a free acknow-
     ledgment that the amount of its earnings was en-
      tirely at the disposal of the head of the family.
     Thus remaining and labouring in conjunction with ,
     and under the eye of, its parents , till manhood
     and womanhood were respectively attained , it ac-
      quired habits of domestication , exceedingly fa-
      vourable to its subsequent progress through life ;
     home being, to the poor man , the very temple of
      fortune , in which he may contrive , if his earnings
      are not scanty indeed , to live with comfort and
     independence .
       In this respect , the child of the domestic ma-
      nufacturer was advantageously placed . It re-
     mained under its paternal roof during the period
      in which puberty was developed ; its passions and
      social instincts were properly cultivated , its bo-
      dily powers were not too early called into requi-
      sition , it had the benefit of green fields , a pure at-
     mosphere, the cheering influences of nature, and
       its diet was plain and substantial. Under these
      auspicious circumstances it grew vigorously, ac-
      quired a healthy tone of system, the various parts
      of its physical organization were well compacted
     and arranged , and it presented an aspect fresh
     and blooming, speaking of animal energy and
      vital activity, and evincing that with it every thing
     went well , and that it enjoyed and profited by
     them .

     and the Squire ,' as the chief landed proprietor
     was generally termed , obtained and deserved his
     importance from his large possessions , low rents ,
     and a simplicity and homeliness of bearing which ,
     when joined to acknowledged family honours , made
     him loved and reverenced by his tenants and neigh-
     bours. He mingled freely with their sports-
     was the general and undisputed arbitrator in all
     questions of law and equity- was a considerate
     and generous landlord --a kind and indulgent mas-

     worthy and amiable man ; tinged , it is true , with
     some vices, but all so coated over with wide-
     spreading charity, that the historian willingly
     drawsthe veil offorgetfulness over them . This race
     of men is now nearly extinct in the manufactur-
     ing districts . Their possessions are passed into
     new hands- their descendants " pushed from their
      stools" by an order of men having few or no traits in

     race indigenous to a peculiar grade of social ad-
     vancement, no longer in being . With them , for
     they were equally a part of the same system , the

      fallen victims to the breaking up of a condition
     of society , and a state of property , which secured a
      flourishing rural population . The few old relics of

      race gone by- are like the scathed oak of another
      generation , withering in the midst of a thriving
      and usurping plantation , which has derived its
      birth and part of its sustenance from its decay, and
      which is rapidly sinking or already sunk below
      the level of the mass that surrounds it.
       Modern intellectual utilitarians measure men's
      actions , and every thing referring to his condition[ ,]
      by mere mind. That state of things is, however ,
      the best which brings to each man's fireside the
      greatest amount of domestic comforts[ ,] though[ it]
     may not be that which will enable him to [boil][ his]
      pot scientifically, or calculate an abstruse problem
      in mathematics . It is not denied , neither is it
      wished to conceal the fact from observation [,] that
      squire, yeoman , and manufacturer differed very
      materially in some of these respects from the[ in-]
      dividuals occupying a correspondent rank at the
      present period , and that the latter, when looked
      upon in this point of view, are infinitely superior
      to the former. Neither in comparing the two is
      there any intention of wishing that the [state] [of]
      society should be again taken back to that parti-
      cular level in the onward progress of civilization[ .]
      It would be vain and childish to do so [.] The for-
      ward impulse must and will be obeyed[ ,] whatever
      the consequences may be to the welfare and [hap-]
      piness of the labouring community . On the one

     in mechanical contrivances , all tending to over-
    match and supersede human labour, and which
     threatens , ere long , to extirpate the very demand
     for it ; a system of toil continued unbroken by rest
     or relaxation , for fourteen or sixteen hours , in a
     heated and crowded mill , and an utter destruction
     of all social and domestic relations ; on the other
     hand, a calm and equable flow of occupation , al
     ternating between the loom and the greensward—
     an intelligence seldom looking beyond present
     means an ignorance of nearly every but the
     most common arts of life-a knowledge chiefly tra-
     ditional a proper station inthe social arrangement,
     a demand for labour full as great , if not greater
     than the existing supply -- a rate of wage quite
     equivalent to the simplicity and limited range of
     their wants , and all the social and domestic relations
     in full force, and properly directed . The great
     question here is the measure of social and domes-
      tic happiness , for these are but synonymes of
     social virtue. They co -exist and have an inti-
     mate dependence one upon another. Degradation
     in these conditions will ever be simultaneous with
     moral declension-a declension incompatible with
     the performance of a great majority of man's best
     and most sacred duties .

     mated by variety of wants , by his living in an

       every facility afforded him for procuring them..-
       the aboriginal and home manufacturer sinks very
      low when compared with the present race. If, on
       the contrary , comfort and domestic happiness
       are to be judged by the fewness of a man's
      wants , with the capability of securing the means
       for their supply, the tables are turned in favour
       of the domestic manufacturer. If the comfort
       of these states of society is to be calculated upon
       another ground--namely, the nature of their
       separate wants and habits--it brings into light
       very striking contrasts. The present manufacturer
      shows a high order of intelligence , seeking its
      amusement in the newspaper, the club , the poli-
        tical union , the lecture room ; looking for its
       stimulus in the gin and beer shops ; for its sup-
       port a limited supply of animal food , once a day,
       joined with copious dilution of weak tea, the
       almost universal concomitant of the spinner and
       weaver's breakfast and evening meal, in many
       cases indeed being nearly its sole constituent ;
       debarred from all athletic sports, or rather not
       having a moment's time to seek, or a bodily
       vigour capable of undertaking them ; an active
      mind in a stunted and bloodless body ;1 a sepa-
       ration of the labourer from his family during the
       whole day, and a consequent disruption of all
       social ties , and this too joined to a similar separa-
       tion amongst the various members of his house-
       hold . The domestic manufacturer possessed a
       very limited degree of information ; his amuse

    ments were exclusively sought in bodily exercise, *
    the dance, quoits , cricket , the chace , the numerous
    seasonal celebrations , &c .; an utter ignorance of
     printed books, beyond the thumbed Bible and a
    few theological tracts ; seeking his stimulus in
    home-brewed ale ; having for his support animal
    food occasionally, but living generally upon farm
    produce, meal or rye bread , eggs , cheese, milk,
    butter, &c. ;* the use of tea quite unknown , or
      * The sturdy opposition given to the introduction of tea, by
    many of the class of yeomen, is strikingly illustrated by an
     anecdote connected with an ancestor of the author. This man ,
     a respectable landowner and tanner, had, like many others, a
     wife strongly disposed to have her own way . When the use
     of tea first became general , she procured a set of the fairy tea-
     cups and huge silver tea-spoons then in vogue, and got some
     tea. Many and serious altercations took place between the
     worthy couple in consequence ; the husband steadily refusing
     what he emphatically denominated stuff, and threatening once
     and again to demolish the whole paraphernalia if she persisted in
     bringing it into daylight. However, the good woman and one
     or two of her neighbours had made the notable discovery that
      it was a beverage singularly fitted to sit and gossip over . On
     one particular day the husband had been more than usually
     furious, and she thought it prudent to beat a partial retreat,
     but by no means to give up the matter. She was for effecting
     this by expediting the hour of tea- drinking, so that all should
     be over before he came to his evening meal . It so happened
     that on this precise day, she had with her one of her gossips ;
     and during their tea-drinking, by some unlucky chance,
     Thomas, for such was his name, was heard clattering his thick-
      soled shoes over the rough pavement before the door, and evi-
     dently coming in. All was hurry to conceal her disobedience
     to his express commands, and this they believed they had
      effectually compassed by thrusting tray and tea-things upon a
      stair-head leading to a sort of lumber room, a place which he
     seldom visited . As fate would have it, he entered and bent

      on under his own roof, or, if exchanged at inter-
       vals for farming occupation , this was going on
      under the eye of, and with the assistance of his
       family ; his children growing up under his im-
      mediate inspection and control ; no lengthened
       separation taking place till they married , and
      became themselves heads of families ; engaged in
       pursuits similar to his own , and in a subordi-
       nate capacity ; and lastly, the same genera-
       tion living age after age on the same spot , and
      under the same thatched roof, which thus became
      a sort of heir-loom , endeared to its occupier
      by a long series of happy memories and home
       delights-being in fact looked on as an old and
       familiar friend ; and in the end, crowding the same
      narrow tenement in the quiet and sequestered

      balmy, and the uncontaminated breath of heaven .
       One circumstance exceedingly favourable to the
      development and continuance of industry and
       temperance, was the plan, now nearly if not quite

       expected nothing less than to have to bewail the utter destruc-

       them, came back , said not a word, and shortly afterwards be-

   exploded , of leasing small farms for one or more
   lives . A man's character always aided him very
   materially in these arrangements with his land-
   lord , as upon this depended the amount both of
   rent and fine , a respectable man , it being well
   known, not being likely to exhaust and impo-
   verish the land during his interest in it . Number-
   less examples might be quoted in illustration of
   this position, and many circumstances detailed
   showing what a beneficial influence resulted from
    it, upon the tone and bearing of the manners of
   the small farmers . They were indeed a highly
   creditable body of men- priding themselves alike
   on the good opinion of their landlord , the exce!-
   lent condition of their farms , and the quality of
   their yarn or cloth .
    The social virtues it has been said will be found
   pari passu with social comforts . The vices that
   were incident to this state of things were the re-
   sult of man's natural propensities , and depended
   more upon the want of any sufficient check upon
   his passions , which were kept in a state of excite-
   ment by health and bodily vigour, than upon
   moral depravity springing from intentional and
   reiterated wrong doing. The very fact of these
   small communities , (for they were generally found
   congregated in petty irregular villages, contain-
   ing from ten to forty cottages , ) being as it were ,
   one great family, prevented , except in a few ex-
   traordinary instances , any systematic course of

       ful in hindering the commission of crime , aided
     by a sense of religion very commonly existing
      amongst them. In one respect this failed however
      --and it was in preventing the indulgence ofsexual
      appetite , in a way and at a time which are still
      blots upon the rural population of many districts .
       Some surprise may be excited probably by the
       assertion , in those whose attention has never been
      directed to the subject , but it is not the less true ,
      that sexual intercourse was almost universal prior
      to marriage in the agricultural districts . This in-
      tercourse must not be confounded with that pro-
      miscuous and indecent concourse of the sexes
      which is so prevalent in towns, and which is
      ruinous alike to health and to morals . It existed
      only between parties where a tacit understanding
      had all the weight of an obligation- and this was ,
      that marriage should be the result . This , in
      nineteen cases out of twenty , took place sooner or
      later ; but still the prevalence of such a course of
      indulgence was in some respect decidedly inju-
      rious to the character and habits of both indivi-
      duals ; weakening, as it inevitably did , that confi-
      dence which ought to exist between unmarried
      parties , and divesting woman of that chaste and
      pure influence which is capable of keeping in
      check man's coarser and more vehement passions .
     Many of the sports of the period , amongst the
     young of both sexes , were obviously intended to
      facilitate and give opportunities to familiarities of
      the closest kind , and were carried on under the

   guidance of some old crone whose directions go-
   verned the apparent conduct of the females upon
   these singular occasions . Many curious laws are
    still in being orally, which throw strong light on
   the social habits of these children of nature down
   to a very recent period .
    It may be urged that an argument is thus af-
   forded for condemning a system, having as a part
   of its institutions , or at least if not acknowledged
   as such, holding out a sufferance for grossness and
   sensuality alike repudiated by public decency
   and private morality. The force of this is at
   once lost when it is known that such a state of
   things was avowed , and admitted as forming an
   integral portion of their habits . Morality consists
   not so much in particular laws , applicable to
   generals, as upon particular customs , binding par-
   ticular communities , in which every separate
   member does that which is done by his neighbour ,
   and in which all share alike the good or evil of
   them . It would be as unjust to bring forward a
   charge of licentiousness and immorality founded
   upon this fact, against the primitive manufacturer
   and agriculturist, as it would be to condemn as
   immoral the customs of other nations, many of
   the habits of half civilized countries , and nearly
   the whole of those of savage tribes . They do not
   acknowledge nor understand the conventional
   laws, which form the code of morals now in being,
   and are not , therefore , amenable to decisions
   founded upon them . The labouring population

      at the period here indicated , did not possess that
      high tone of public decency, which the advance
      of refinement has since developed . It must ,
      therefore, be judged leniently in these respects ,
      and not condemned as sinning greatly, because
      wanting a certain fastidiousness of manners .
      Man is nevertheless a rational creature , and the
      more he governs himself by the dictates of reason ,
      the nearer he undoubtedly approaches to moral
      perfection . His destiny was never meant to be
      that of a mere animal, nor was it intended that
      his happiness should depend upon the gratifica-
      tion of his appetites. Unlimited or unrestrained
      indulgence of sexual desire in early life , is pre-
      judicial equally to the tone of body and mind ,
      and it is much to be wished , that the custom here
      alluded to was eradicated and totally forgotten .
     Bad as its effects were , and are still , they sink into
      utter insignificance, when compared to the condi-
      tion of the present manufacturing population in
      these respects, the consideration of which forms a
      subsequent portion of this work.
      The moralist, though he may condemn and de-
      claim against this , as being at variance with his
      peculiar ideas , will , if just , attach no farther blame
      than by saying- it was the error of a system belong-
      ing to one stage of civilization . But the philanthro-
      pist, the man who , free from morbid sensibilities ,
      views and judges the manners and customs of
      states in relation only to the happiness of the
      existing race, will lament- that intellectual excel-

   to home and domestic duties , which in no small
   degree served as their atonements.
    The mischief produced by this means was ,
   however, of small amount . This premature inter-
   course occurred , as has been before stated , gene-
    rally between parties, when a tacit though bind-
   ing understanding existed . Its promiscuousness
   seldom went further. So binding was this en-
   gagement, that the examples of desertion were
   exceedingly rare-though marriage was generally
   deferred till pregnancy fully declared itself. *
     * Poor laws Commission. " I appeal to the experience of
    all overseers in rural districts, whether instances of marriage
    taking place among the labouring classes are not so very rare

    the condition of the domestic manufacturer, prior
    to the introduction of steam as an antogonist to
    human power ; and a brief review of these will
    form an interesting and curious feature in the
    history of manufactures, and illustrate the great
    changes which the last forty years have sufficed
    to operate in the circumstances and character of
    those engaged in them . It is singular how little
    attention has been as yet paid to this subject .
   A complete revolution has been affected in the
    distribution of property, the very face of a great
    country has been re-modelled , various classes of
     its inhabitants utterly swept away, the habits of
    all have undergone such vast alterations, that they
    resemble a people of a different age and genera-
    tion ; and yet little has been said , and still less
    written upon them ; and an epoch which has re-
    volutionized and changed a great nation , has been
    going on, without any examination of its precur-
    sory events, or its ulterior influences .
     The distaff and spinning-wheel , producing a
    single thread , were for a long time the only me-
    thods of spinning . About the middle ofthe last cen-
    tury, the demand for cloth was so much increased ,
    that the inventive faculties of those interested in
    it were called into activity, and improved ma-
    chines for spinning were very soon the result .
    Some of the contrivers of the most important im-
    provements failed to demonstrate for a while, the
    value of their discoveries ; others were driven by
    a cruel and ill -judged persecution , to carry their

      knowledge to other countries . A narrow and
       prejudiced view was taken by the public at large,
       and little encouragement given for a time, to those
      who have in the end proved themselves the great-
       est benefactors to their country. In the teeth of
        all these impediments , the pressing demand for
       cloth gradually forced the domestic manufacturer
       to the adoption of improved modes of spinning ;
       for the difficulty had always lain in producing an
       adequate supply of materials in a state fit for the
       loom . One half the weaver's time had generally
       to be spent in waiting for work . This state of
       things was however remedied by the mule and the
       jenny, both of which enabled the spinner to pro-
       duce a greatly increased quantity of yarn , when
       compared to that formerly supplied by the wheel.
        The hand-loom weaver was of course greatly
       benefited by all these improvements , without any
       extra outlay of capital-the loom which sufficed
       to weave a small amount, being of equal efficiency
       to turn out a greater. The call for more cloth ,
       and the facilities given in the first processes, re-
      moved him from the vaccilating and uncertain
       conditions in which he was before placed .
      A family of four adult persons , with two chil-
       dren as winders , earned at the end of the last and
       at the commencement of the present century,
        41. per week, when working ten hours per day ;
      when work was pressed they could of course earn
       more-a single weaver having been known to earn
       upwards of two pounds per week. This however

    required great industry, and was by no means
   common ; weaving too , when thus exercised , is
   not easy labour ; the position in which the weaver
    sits is not the best for muscular exertion , having
    no firm support for his feet , which are alternately
    raised and depressed in working the treddles. He
   has thus to depend for a fulcrum, chiefly on the
   muscles of his back, which are kept in constant
   and vigorous action- while one order of muscles is
   employed with little power of variation , in moving
   the shuttle and beam . These processes when
    carried on for many successive hours , are very
    wearying, and the exertion required becomes after
    a while laborious . The weaver who worked hard
    therefore, actually toiled- a condition widely dif-
    ferent from that of the steam-loom weaver.
    One of the first effects of the constant demand
   upon the labour of the weaver, resulting from a
   more extensive and permanent supply of yarn ,
   was the gradual abandonment of farming as an
    accessary, which had been very common with the
   more respectable portion of the weavers . His
    labour, when employed on his loom , was more
    profitable, and more immediate in its return , than
   when devoted to agricultural pursuits . This ne-
    cessarily led to the introduction of a new order of
    farm tenants, men who exclusively devoted them-
    selves to the cultivation of the soil , who looked to
    its produce as their only mode of acquiring the
   means of support, and who , in nine cases out
    of ten, were mere holders at will- a lowering

       in respectabilty, which it is probable will be
       scarcely understood by those who are not familiar
      with the feeling and grades of rank in this class ,
       or labourers .
        This change in the weavers occupation , pro-
      duced very considerable influence upon him in a
       social point of view. It decidedly tended to lower
       his rank and character, by making him a simple
       labourer, and removing him from that which did
       then , and which still does confer rural distinction , -
       the holding or possessing land . This had formerly
      brought himself and children partially upon the
      same level with the small freeholder or yeoman ,
       properly so called . It also brought him into con-
       tact with this order of men on many occasions ,-
      and remotely, it is true, but still near enough to
       benefit him , it assimulated his condition with that
       of the gentry of the neighbourhood : it gave him
      an honest pride in his capacity, heightened the
      tone of his general character, and was thus mo-
       rally beneficial to him .
       The great body of hand - loom weavers had at all
       periods been divided , by a well defined line of de-
       marcation , into two very distinct classes . This
       division arose from the circumstance of their
      being landholders , being entirely dependant
      upon weaving for their support. It has been
      seen that the weaver, who was also a small
      farmer, lost something by the increase in the de-
      mand for cloth , while, from the same cause , the
       simple weaver, who had all along depended upon

   that demand , gained a step in advance , and now
   found himself on an equality with those who had
   hitherto been his superiors .
    The secondary, or inferior class of artizans , had
   at all times been great sufferers from the impos-
    sibility of supplying themselves with materials for
   their labour. Considerable vacations were fre-
   quently occurring in this respect , and at these
   periods they underwent very severe privations .
   This irregularity had produced its usual effects
   upon their industrial character, rendering them
   improvident, devoid of fore-thought , and careless
   in their expenditure . Not being able to calculate ,
   had they been so disposed, upon the certainty
   that their exertions would be invariably called for,
   they became indifferent , enjoyed the good whilst
    it lasted , and starved through the interval as they
   best might.
     It is an indisputable fact , that irregularity in
   the demand for labour, from whatever cause it
   may arise, by occasionally throwing the workmen
   out of employ, and generating idle habits , is one
   ofthe most disorganizing and degrading influences
   which canbe brought to bear upon their character .
   Independently of the diminished rate of wages ,
   and the acrimonious and suspicious feeling which,
   of late years , have sprung up between the masters
   and men, the stoppages which have taken place
   in nearly all the mills in rotation , for periods more
   or less protracted , sometimes from the fault of one
   party, sometimes of another , have been full as in-

      or as they may well be termed during the pros-
      perous days of hand -manufacture-- the aristocracy
      of manufacturers , was undergoing changes still
      greater and more rapid than that of the weavers ,
      and passing through a revolution which modified
      the whole body , and terminated finally in the ruin
      of the greater portion.
       In the early times of manufacturing , the spinner
      and the weaver were to some extent synonymous
      -so far indeed , that the processes were carried on
      under the same roof, and by the same individuals ;
      the distaff, the wheel, and the loom being all
       called into requisition by a single family.
       At a later period , when improvements in [ma-]
      chinery progressed rapidly[,] stimulated [as] [they]
      were by the inability constantly felt to supply [the]
      demand for yarn , and as these improved machines
       at each step became more bulky[,] more compli-
      cated, and consequently more expensive -a[ divi-]
       sion began to shew itself between the weaver
      and spinner, --the latter throwing aside his wheel
      and devoting himself to the loom[,] [trusting][ to] [ex-]
       ternal sources for his yarn , from a growing [inabi-]
       bility to purchase such machinery as would
      enable him to spin profitably- and the [former][ de-]
       serting the loom, and applying his funds to [pro-]
      cure the best and most recent contivances for
       spinning, knowing as he did that a market [was]
      always open to his produce [.]
       At this period, that is at the time when spin-
      ning was become a separate branch, and when

```

   the division between the two bodies was well
   defined, the spinners were joined by another[ class]
   of persons, who had heretofore held aloof, from
   manufacture-and this was the yeoman-the [male]
    freeholder now nearly extinct as a part of the
    social confederacy.
    The yeoman had lived generation after gene-
   ration upon his patrimonial acres- rarely increa-
   sing their extent and quite as rarely lessening
   them . He had , however, failed to keep pace with
   the onward march of events-had confined him-
    self to cultivating his land precisely in the same
   way in which it had been cultivated by his fore-
    fathers-viewed all innovations as rank heresy ,
   vegetated upon his natal soil , profiting either it
   or the world but little ; but having , notwithstand-
   ing many points about him of real value . He
   was strictly honest in all his dealings-though
   almost universally improvident, more , however,
   from want of mental energy and forethought,
    than from actual extravagance- contented with his
    lot , and a kind and hearty neighbour- but utterly
    unable to cope with the crisis which was opening
   upon him . He had hitherto been surrounded by
    petty farmers-who had generally eked out their
    bad management as cultivators by being weavers,
    and who had served him as bulwarks or break-
    waters against the impending storm . These were
    one by one removed , and their places imme-
    diately occupied by a race of men who gave a
    considerably increased rent, and who by im-

     proved modes of husbandry, and by wringing
     from the soil all it could possibly yield, soon
     drove the small proprietor from the markets
     which he had so long supplied . Thus pressed
     upon by superior industry , and an activity with
     which he could not compete , the yeoman was
     driven to embark some portion of his means
     iu the purchase of spinning machines, and before
     very long, great quantities of yarn were produced
    by the inmates of old farm -houses, in which pre-
     viously the most sluggish inertness had prevailed .
      Nothing can more clearly shew how very im-
     perfectly this class had used its resources, than the
     fact, that five -sevenths of those who purchased
     these machines were obliged to have recourse to
     a loan, generally a mortgage , to raise the money.
      The price of the mere complicated spinning
     machines was very considerable, and it has been
     seen removed them out of the reach of the infe-
      rior class of weavers. This , aided by other causes
     already noticed , brought the small freeholder into
     the field . At the same time monied men began
     to turn their attention to a branch of trade , the
     returns from which were very rapid . This brought
     a farther accession of capital into it, and led to
     the erection of mills containing a greater or less
     number of spinning machines , propelled by water
     power, with the assistance of human labour .
     These mills were built in places at some distance
     from the towns , though as near as circumstances
     would permit for the convenience of markets , and

    readiness of transport for the raw and manufac-
    tured material . 3 Their site in other respects was
    chosen with regard to two necessary things,
    one, the existence of a stream of sufficient [volume]
   and permanence, - and the other the neighbour-
   hood of suitable workmen[ .]
     These mills were exclusively devoted to the
    first processes of manufacture [,] namely[,] carding
   and spinning . Their gradual increase very soon
    influenced the prosperity of the domestic manu-
    facturer his profits quickly fell, workmen being
    readily found to superintend the mill labour [,][ at]
    a rate of wages high it is true ; but [yet][ compara-]
    tively much lower than the estimated value of
   home labour.
     Another cause which tended to injure the pri-
    vate spinner was the incessant and expensive [im-]
    provements in the construction of machines .
   Thus the man who one year laid out a consider-
    able sum in the purchase of a jenny of the best
   and most approved make , found himself[,] in the
    course of the year following, so much behind-
    hand , that with his utmost industry he could
    barely turn out a sufficient quantity of yarn [to]
    repay him for his present labour[,] in consequence
    of alterations which threw the [productive][ power]
    of his machine into the shade [.] The price of yarn
    became of necessity depreciated in proportion [to]
    to the quantity produced , which was now more
    than sufficient to supply the home demand [.] Find-
    ing his efforts thus futile to keep pace with im-

      proved machinery, he was compelled either to
      dispose of his jenny, and this at an immense sa-
       crifice, often indeed at a merely nominal price,
      or make an arrangement with the maker for an
      exchange at a rate almost equally ruinous . The
     number of machines which at this period were
     thrown back into the market, gave a strong im-
      pulse to the growth of the mills ; a machine
      that was not sufficiently perfect for the purpose
      of domestic manufacture , doing well enough
      in a mill in conjunction with others , worked
      at a less rate of wages, and assisted by water
     power, when its use was valueless to its original
     owner, who was consequently left in many cases
      in a worse condition , in a pecuniary point of view,
      than when he commenced his new vocation , no
      time having been given him to cover its first
      cost.
       This necessarily led to great difficulties and to
      embarrassments of no ordinary kind , and was the
       first step towards the abolition of the small free-
      holder or yeoman . Their long course of inac-
      tivity, and the little diffusion of intelligence
     amongst them, rendered them incapable of main-
      taining the struggle with men who had been ac-
     customed to the variations of trade ; and whose
      forethought enabled them to apply remedies , and
      take such precautionary and anticipative measures
      as screened them from loss . Their little estates
     became in the lapse of a few years so encumbered ,
      as to be utterly worthless to them, and a very

   rapid and very extensive change took place in
   landed proprietorship from 1790 to 1810 , the
   period when this transition was in progress .
     This declension, though nearly, was not quite
    universal. The apathy which had so long op-
   pressed and hidden the energies of their character,
   had failed in quite extinguishing them ; and a few
   of these men , shaking off their slothful habits , both
   of body and mind, devoted themselves to remedy-
   ing their condition with a perseverance certain to
   be successful . Joining to this determination a
    practical acquaintance with the details of manu-
    factures , personal superintendance, and indus-
    try, several of the most eminently successful
   steam-manufacturers have sprung from this class
    of people, and have long since become the most
    opulent of a wealthy community.
     There is a singularity attending the rise of
   some of these individuals , showing very strongly
   how infinitely superior is personal endeavour to
   accumulated wealth , when both are devoted to the
   same purposes . Few of the men who entered the
    trade rich were successful . They trusted too
   much to others too little to themselves ; whilst,
   on the contrary, the men who did establish them-
    selves were raised by their own efforts-com-
   mencing in a very humble way, and pushing their
   advance by a series of unceasing exertions , hav-
    ing a very limited capital to begin with, or even
   none at all save that of their own labour. *

      The time was now arrived when another great
      change took place in the relative situations of the
     two divisions of manufacturers. The improved
      machines ; their increased number ; the esta-
      blishment of mills ; the accession of capital - one
     and all produced a much greater quantity of yarn
      than could by any possibility be converted into
      cloth by the hand-loom weaver . A surplus of
      course remained, which was either sent to the
      foreign market, or remained as a dead weight
     upon the maker . The demand for cloth was how-
      ever still unsupplied , and it became necessary to
      introduce great numbers of new hands as weavers .
     So long as the supply of yarn had been limited ,
      or beneath, or just equal to the demand, the
      weavers had felt but little competition ; their
     wages had consequently remained steady. Now ,
     however, when the outcry for cloth continued ,
     and yarn was abundant, a large body of weavers
     immigrated into the manufacturing districts-
      almost the entire mass of agricultural labourers
      deserted their occupations, and a new race of
     hand-loom weavers , which had undergone none of
     the transitions of the primitive manufacturers,
     were the product of the existing state of things .
       This body of men was of a still lower
     grade in the social scale than the origi-
      nal weavers , had been earning a much less
     amount of wages , and had been accustomed [to]
     be mere labourers . The master spinners , there-
      fore, found them ready to work at an inferior

```
    price, and thus discovered an outlet for their
    extra quantity of yarn . This at once led to a
    great depreciation in the price of hand-loom la-
    bour, and was the beginning of that train of dis-
    asters which has finally terminated in reducing
    those who have clung to it to a state of
    starvation.
    Human power is urged beyond a certain point
    with great difficulty ; and , what is still worse ,
   when great numbers of individuals are in exclusive
    possession of one particular occupation, the na-
    tural caprice incident to mankind , with an occa-
    sional inaptitude for regular labour , and a dispo-
    sition to interfere vexatiously , at times, when its
    employer is pressed , either by a superabundance ,
    or by a too small demand for his goods , have
    always rendered it a power difficult to manage,
    and still more difficult to be depended upon.
    Nor are these the only unpleasantnesses con-
    nected with it : men are apt to acquire notions
    of exclusive possession , and to hold an opinion
    that improvements in machinery , which lessen
    the value of their labour, are wrongs inflicted
    upon them— are infringements upon their peculiar
    domain . These evils were keenly felt by the
    early manufacturers , who had to trust entirely to
    hand - labour . They were subjected periodically
    to severe immediate losses , and to the chance of
     still greater ulterior ones, by the refractory spirit
    of their hands, who timed their opportunity
    when the markets were particularly pressing,

      the other two put together.
      The class of poor weavers were thus instanta-
      neously elevated very considerably in worldly con-
      sideration . They were freed from one great cause
      of depression, which had hitherto prevented all
      chance of improvement. They now took their
      stand upon the same ground with the weaver,
     who had hitherto been a great farmer, and who
      had come down one degree in the social scale, in
      consequence of giving up his land for the purpose
      of devoting himself to the more profitable business
      of weaving. This amalgamation of the two di-

      general character as a body, rendered them more
      united , and by diffusing one species of labour uni-
       versally over the whole class , gave them a com-
      munity ofinterests and feelings which bound them
      together.
      A very material improvement, therefore , had
      been gradually operating in both classes of
      weavers, during the half century immediately
      preceding the application of steam power. This
      improvement had not arisen so much from any
       increase in the rate of payment for labour , as
      from a market generally understocked , and a con-
       stantly increasing production for yarn , which
       enabled them to work full hours , and of conse-
       quently to throw off a regular and sufficient quan-
       tity of cloth .

     and passing through a revolution which modified
     the whole body, and terminated finally in the ruin
     of the greater portion .
       In the early times of manufacturing , the spinner
     and the weaver were to some extent synonymous
     -so far indeed , that the processes were carried on
     under the same roof, and by the same individuals ;
     the distaff, the wheel, and the loon being all
      called into requisition by a single family.
      At a later period , when improvements in ma-
     chinery progressed rapidly, stimulated as they
     were by the inability constantly felt to supply the
     demand for yarn , and as these improved machines
      at each step became more bulky , more compli-
     cated, and consequently more expensive—a divi-
      sion began to shew itself between the weaver
     and spinner, --the latter throwing aside his wheel
     and devoting himself to the loom , trusting to ex-
      ternal sources for his yarn , from a growing inabi-
      bility to purchase such machinery as would
     enable him to spin profitably- and the former de-
      serting the loom, and applying his funds to pro-
     cure the best and most recent contivances for
     spinning, knowing as he did that a market was
     always open to his produce.
      At this period, that is at the time when spin-
     ning was become a separate branch, and when

   the division between the two bodies was well
    defined , the spinners were joined by another [class]
   of persons , who had heretofore held aloof[,] from
   manufacture-and this was the yeoman-the male
    freeholder now nearly extinct as a part of the
    social [confederacy].
    The yeoman had lived generation after gene-
    ration upon his patrimonial acres- rarely increa-
   sing their extent and quite as rarely lessening
   them . He had , however, failed to keep pace with
   the onward march of events-had confined him-
    self to cultivating his land precisely in the same
   way in which it had been cultivated by his [fore-]
    fathers -viewed all innovations as rank heresy [,]
    vegetated upon his natal soil , profiting either [it]
   or the world but little ; but having[ ,] notwithstand-
    ing many points about him of real value . He
   was strictly honest in all his dealings-though
    almost universally improvident , more , however,
    from want of mental energy and forethought,
    than from actual extravagance- contented with [his]
    lot , and a kind and hearty neighbour- but [utterly]
    unable to cope with the crisis which was opening
    upon him. He had hitherto been surrounded by
    petty farmers- who had generally eked out their
    bad management as cultivators by being weavers [,]
    and who had served him as bulwarks or break-
    waters against the impending storm[.] These were
    one by one removed , and their places imme-
    diately occupied by a race of men who gave [a]
    considerably increased rent, and who by im-

     proved modes of husbandry, and by wringing
     from the soil all it could possibly yield, soon
     drove the small proprietor from the markets
     which he had so long supplied . Thus pressed
     upon by superior industry, and an activity with
     which he could not compete , the yeoman was
     driven to embark some portion of his means
     iu the purchase of spinning machines, and before
     very long, great quantities of yarn were produced
     by the inmates of old farm-houses , in which pre-
     viously the most sluggish inertness had prevailed .
      Nothing can more clearly shew how very im-
     perfectly this class had used its resources, than the
     fact, that five- sevenths of those who purchased
     these machines were obliged to have recourse to
     a loan, generally a mortgage , to raise the money.
      The price of the mere complicated spinning
     machines was very considerable , and it has been
     seen removed them out of the reach of the infe-
     rior class of weavers . This, aided by other causes
     already noticed , brought the small freeholder into
     the field . At the same time monied men began
     to turn their attention to a branch of trade , the
     returns from which were very rapid . This brought
     a farther accession of capital into it, and led to
     the erection of mills containing a greater or less
     number of spinning machines , propelled by water
     power, with the assistance of human labour.
     These mills were built in places at some distance
     from the towns, though as near as circumstances
     would permit for the convenience of markets , and

    readiness of transport for the raw and manufac-
    tured material . Their site in other respects was
    chosen with regard to two necessary things , -
    one, the existence of a stream of sufficient volume
   and permanence, and the other the neighbour-
   hood of suitable workmen .
     These mills were exclusively devoted to the
    first processes of manufacture , namely, carding
    and spinning . Their gradual increase very soon
    influenced the prosperity of the domestic manu-
    facturer- his profits quickly fell , workmen being
    readily found to superintend the mill labour , at
    a rate of wages high it is true ; but yet compara-
    tively much lower than the estimated value of
   home labour.
     Another cause which tended to injure the pri-
    vate spinner was the incessant and expensive im-
    provements in the construction of machines .
    Thus the man who one year laid out a consider-
    able sum in the purchase of a jenny of the best
    and most approved make , found himself, in the
    course of the year following, so much behind-
    hand , that with his utmost industry he could
    barely turn out a sufficient quantity of [yarn][ to]
    repay him for his present labour, in consequence
    of alterations which threw the productive power
    of his machine into the shade . The price of yarn
    became of necessity depreciated in proportion to
    to the quantity produced, which was now more
    than sufficient to supply the home demand . Find-
    ing his efforts thus futile to keep pace with im-

```
     proved machinery, he was compelled either to
     dispose of his jenny, and this at an immense sa-
      crifice , often indeed at a merely nominal price ,
     or make an arrangement with the maker for an
     exchange at a rate almost equally ruinous . The
     number of machines which at this period were
     thrown back into the market, gave a strong im-
     pulse to the growth of the mills ; a machine
      that was not sufficiently perfect for the purpose
     of domestic manufacture, doing well enough
     in a mill in conjunction with others , worked
      at a less rate of wages, and assisted by water
     power, when its use was valueless to its original
     owner, who was consequently left in many cases
     in a worse condition , in a pecuniary point of view,
     than when he commenced his new vocation , no
     time having been given him to cover its first
     cost.
      This necessarily led to great difficulties and to
     embarrassments of no ordinary kind , and was the
      first step towards the abolition of the small free-
     holder or yeoman . Their long course of inac-
      tivity, and the little diffusion of intelligence
     amongst them, rendered them incapable of main-
     taining the struggle with men who had been ac-
     customed to the variations of trade ; and whose
     forethought enabled them to apply remedies , and
     take such precautionary and anticipative measures
     as screened them from loss . Their little estates
     became in the lapse of a few years so encumbered ,
     as to be utterly worthless to them, and a very

   rapid and very extensive change took place in
   landed proprietorship from 1790 to 1810, the
   period when this transition was in progress .
    This declension, though nearly, was not quite
   universal. The apathy which had so long op-
   pressed and hidden the energies of their character,
   had failed in quite extinguishing them ; and a few
   of these men, shaking off their slothful habits, both
   of body and mind , devoted themselves to remedy-
   ing their condition with a perseverance certain to
   be successful . Joining to this determination a
   practical acquaintance with the details of manu-
   factures , personal superintendance , and indus-
   try, several of the most eminently successful
   steam -manufacturers have sprung from this class
   of people, and have long since become the most
   opulent of a wealthy community.
    There is a singularity attending the rise of
   some of these individuals , showing very strongly
   how infinitely superior is personal endeavour to
   accumulated wealth , when both are devoted to the
   same purposes. Few of the men who entered the
   trade rich were successful. They trusted too
   much to others too little to themselves ; whilst ,
   on the contrary, the men who did establish them-
   selves were raised by their own efforts- com-
   mencing in a very humble way, and pushing their
   advance by a series of unceasing exertions , hav-
   ing a very limited capital to begin with, or even
   none at all save that of their own labour. *

```
      The time was now arrived when another great
     change took place in the relative situations of the
     two divisions of manufacturers . The improved
     machines ; their increased number ; the esta-
     blishment of mills ; the accession of capital- one
     and all produced a much greater quantity of yarn
     than could by any possibility be converted into
      cloth by the hand-loom weaver . A surplus of
     course remained, which was either sent to the
     foreign market, or remained as a dead weight
     upon the maker . The demand for cloth was how-
     ever still unsupplied , and it became necessary to
     introduce great numbers of new hands as weavers.
     So long as the supply of yarn had been limited ,
     or beneath, or just equal to the demand , the
     weavers had felt but little competition ; their
     wages had consequently remained steady. Now,
     however, when the outcry for cloth continued ,
     and yarn was abundant, a large body of weavers
     immigrated into the manufacturing districts-
     almost the entire mass of agricultural labourers
     deserted their occupations , and a new race of
     hand- loom weavers , which had undergone none of
     the transitions of the primitive manufacturers ,
     were the product of the existing state of things .
       This body of men was of a still lower
     grade in the social scale than the origi-
      nal weavers , had been earning a much less
     amount of wages, and had been accustomed to
     be mere labourers . The master spinners, there-
     fore, found them ready to work at an inferior

```

```
    price, and thus discovered an outlet for their
    extra quantity of yarn . This at once led to a
    great depreciation in the price of hand-loom la-
    bour, and was the beginning of that train of dis-
     asters which has finally terminated in reducing
    those who have clung to it to a state of
     starvation .
     Human power is urged beyond a certain point
    with great difficulty ; and , what is still worse ,
    when great numbers of individuals are in exclusive
     possession of one particular occupation, the na-
     tural caprice incident to mankind, with an occa-
     sional inaptitude for regular labour, and a dispo-
     sition to interfere vexatiously , at times , when its
     employer is pressed , either by a superabundance ,
     or by a too small demand for his goods , have
     always rendered it a power difficult to manage,
    and still more difficult to be depended upon.
    Nor are these the only unpleasantnesses con-
     nected with it : men are apt to acquire notions.
     of exclusive possession , and to hold an opinion
     that improvements in machinery, which lessen
     the value of their labour, are wrongs inflicted
    upon them— are infringements upon their peculiar
     domain . These evils were keenly felt by the
     early manufacturers , who had to trust entirely to
     hand - labour . They were subjected periodically
     to severe immediate losses , and to the chance of
      still greater ulterior ones, by the refractory spirit
     of their hands, who timed their opportunity
    when the markets were particularly pressing,

```
      to urge their claims . They had indeed but
       little alternative ,—and it is quite certain that a
      crisis was rapidly approaching which would have
     checked, if not annihilated , the progress of ma-
      nufactures, when steam, and its application to
     machinery,* at once turned the current against
      the men, and has been since steadily but securely
     sweeping their opposition to the dust, all their
      efforts to free themselves from its subjection
     having been totally unavailing, and worse than
      useless .
      * The first steam looms were introduced in 1806, and fol-
      lowed by serious riots and breaking and destroying of ma-
      chinery.

      but a part of the great whole , exhibiting , as in a
      microcosm , the virtues and vices which are its dis-
      tinguishing characteristics .
      One of the most striking revolutions ever pro-
      duced in the moral and social condition of a moiety
      ofa great nation , is that which has been consequent
      to the application of steam to machinery . It is one
      which will be found to possess many points of
      great interest to every man who considers the
      happiness , or looks forward to the probable destiny
      of that large portion of the productive population ,
      connected with manufactures .
       The rapidity with which this revolution has
      been effected , is not the least remarkable circum-
      stance about it ; and strikingly illustrates the truth
      of the foregoing proposition- that wherever men
      are congregated in large bodies , their morals must
      be deteriorated . One great effect of the steam-
      engine has been , to crowd workmen together ; to
       collect them from parts in which they had hitherto
      formed portions of a scattered population . But
      the cause, powerful as it is, has been aided by
     many others of scarcely less efficacy ; and it is
      these which require elucidation , as they throw a
      strong light upon the present depraved and de-
      based condition of the class of manufacturing
      labourers .
      Many of the first successful manufacturers were
     men who had their origin in the rank of mere ope-
       ratives , or who sprung from the extinct class of
     yeomen . It has been already explained that this

```

-----

```
    class had been driven, by the pressure of circum-
    stances, * to the adoption of spinning, at the period
   when trade was undergoing that series of changes
   which ended in the introduction of steam .
    The celerity with which some of these indivi-
    duals accumulated wealth in the early times of
   steam spinning and weaving, are proofs-if any
   such were wanting - that they were men of quick
   views, great energy of character, and possessing
   no small share of sagacity ; and were by these
   means able to avail themselves to the utmost of
    the golden advantages , which were presented
    to their grasp , from 1790 to 1817 , a time when
   they supplied the whole universe with the products
    of manufacture.
    But they were men of very limited general in-
   formation- men who saw and knew little of any
    thing beyond the demand for their twist or cloth ,
   and with the speediest and best modes for their
   production. They were , however, from their ac-
   quired station , men who exercised very conside-
    rable influence upon the hordes of workmen who
   became dependent upon them .
    The acquisition of wealth , unfortunately for the
    interests of all parties , was not attended by a cor-
   respondent improvement in their moral and social
    character ; on the contrary , all who had an oppor-
    tunity of watching its effects, can only deplore
   and condemn the evil purposes to which, for many
    years, some portions of it were applied .

      The extreme rapidity with which the returns
      were made for a considerable period-and this too
      with an immense profit- and the rich and appa-
      rently unbounded prospect that was stretched
      out before them, fairly turned their heads. In
      this respect, indeed , they resembled the man in the
      Arabian Nights' tale , whose eye had been touched
      with the magic ointment, and which in conse-
      quence presented to his mental vision an endless
      display of wealth . The uproarious enjoyments ,
      the sensual indulgences , which were witnessed
      at the orgies of these men , totally unchecked by
     any intercourse with more polished society , should
      have had the veil of oblivion drawn over them ,
     were it not that, to some degree , they tend to ex-
      plain the depravity which in a few years , like a
     moral plague , spread over the manufacturing po-
      pulation , wherever they were brought together in
     numerous bodies .
      The sprinkling of men of more refined habits
     amongst the early successful cotton manufacturers,
     was extremely scanty. Very few who brought
      large capital into the trade, were fortunate- or
     even made satisfactory progress. Neither will this
      fact be considered singular, when it is remem-
     bered with whom the battle had to be fought.
     They had to oppose men who had a practical ac-
     quaintance with machinery , and who laboured
     themselves , assiduously and diligently ; whereas
     the previous pursuits and education of the capi-
      talist , had unfitted him, in some respects, for that

    rapidity of action and quickness of calculation ,
    which were essentially necessary, if he must
    keep pace with the daily improvements pro-
    jected and carried on around him .
     Master cotton- spinners and weavers then [,] at
    the commencement of this important [epoch] [,][ were]
    in many instances men sprung from the ranks [of]
    the labourers , or from a grade just removed above
    these uneducated - of coarse habits-sensual[ in]
    their enjoyments-partaking of the rude [revelry]
    of their dependants- overwhelmed by [success-]
    but yet, paradoxical as it may sound[ ,][ industrious]
    men, and active and far-sighted tradesmen[ .]
     Many of these might be found , after a night
    spent in debauchery and licentiousness, sobered
    down by an hour or two of rest, and by the
    ringing of the factory bell, going through the
    business of the day with untiring activity and
    unerring rectitude-surrounded too , as they were,
    by their companions , alike busily engaged under
    their inspection- again to plunge, at the expira-

    of inebriation and riot.
     Meanwhile a great change was progressing in
    the homes of these men. Wealth brought with it
    some of its usual accessories . The low and irre-
    gularly built farm -house , or the cottage attached
    to the mill , were exchanged for mansions erected
    purposely for them- larger, more commodious , and
    in the most modern order of domestic architecture ,
    furnished in a style of shew and expense-if not

     of taste- sufficiently indicative of the state of the
     owner's purse and prospects ; and to these were
     transferred the manners which had unhappily
     disgraced their late more humble residences .
     They did not, it is true , introduce here their
    low and dissolute companions, in whose society a
     portion of their time was still spent . The re-
     unions, however, which did occur , though of a
     different order, consisting generally of men of
     their own, or somewhat inferior standing, were
     fully as debased , and drink-drink was their only
     amusement and occupation .
      Utterly destitute of every thing intellectual ,
     and utterly condemning every thing savouring of
     refinement, whether in manner or thought , they
     were in some measure driven to the indulgence of
     their animal sensations . This was generally
     sought for in the use of ardent spirits, which
     roused and maddened them for a time into fu-
     rious joy, and rendered them unconscious of all
     that was due to decency or propriety . Thus"
     wallowing in intemperance , little wonder can be
     excited that other passions were stimulated into
     active operation ; and from their situation , un-
     bounded facilities were offered for their display .
      Animal sensations must ever be the predomi-
     nant occupiers of coarse , uneducated minds . The
     great advantage of education , when conducted
     in a way calculated to attain its legitimate
     end , is— that it makes man less a prey to sense ,
    by giving him other and nobler contemplations ,

   and fixing his regards upon mental exertions and
   enjoyments , which are diametrically opposed to
   the grosser demands of his nature . This is the
   advantage that education possesses when legiti-
   mately conducted ; but these purposes are not
   gained by common education, which is too funda-
   mental, and too exclusively intellectual, and
   which aims apparently at merely expanding the
   ideas, without troubling itself as to their proper
    direction . Hence they are left to wander back
    to their original tendency , aided in their intensity
   by the very imperfect development given to
    morals .
    The almost entire extinction of sexual decency ,
   which is one of the darkest stains upon the cha-
    racter of the manufacturing population-the laxity
   in all the moral obligations which ought to exist
   between the sexes, and the consequent loss of
    this most important influence in the formation of
    social manners , may be traced , to some extent, to
    this period of their history.
    The little restraint which existed as to inter-
    course between the sexes , * before this juncture ,
   may with some degree of justice be pointed out
    as having laid the ground - work or paved the way
    for the existing dereliction . This is doubtless
    correct, in so far that it had broken up the deli-
    cacy of feeling, and chastity of deportment , which
    should distinguish the bearing of the young of

     with the grossness which now sprung up on all
      sides, dating its origin , it is again repeated , in
      the want of moral discipline on the part of many
      of the early manufacturers .

      of these parties , it may be remarked , that the
      mischief lay in no small degree upon the par-
      ticular juncture in which they were brought so

     scenes were enacted that even put to the blush
     the lascivious Saturnalia of the Romans , the rites
     ofthe Pagoda girls of India, and the Harem life of
     the most voluptuous Ottoman .

    Numbers of these infatuated youths reaped
   their reward early, and were cut off on the very
   threshold of manhood , by a career of unbridled
   indulgence ; others had a more prolonged ex-
   istence , a " sort of life in death , " and sunk
   gradually into the grave, borne down by slow and
   lingering consumption ; or their physical energies
   were so reduced , their healthy stamina so de-
   stroyed, that they had no power to resist disease,
   however slight, and were consequently carried
   away in rapid succession-
       " Et minimæ vires frangere quassa valent[.]"
   Marriage was repudiated amongst them, and was
   indeed utterly at variance with the license reign-
   ing over all their sexual appetites .
     Nothing can more clearly shew the demoralizing
    effects of this pernicious intercourse than the fact,
    that a girl, who was known to have lived in a state
   of concubinage , found no difficulty in marrying
   subsequently amongst her equals. So debased
   became their tone of thinking, and so utterly
   were they lost to all sense of decency and
   shame, that not only was no difficulty found by
   these girls in procuring husbands , but this was
   even managed during the very time their intimacy
   was going on with their seducer , and which , not
   unfrequently , was continued up to the very day of
    their marriage, and even subsequently.

     mitted or sanctioned such abominable proceed-
      ings , did not shut his eyes to all comers , going
     even one step beyond the Roman Gippius , whose
     remark became proverbial in his own day-" non
     omnibus dormio ."
       This laxity , or rather this entire absence of all
     regard for moral obligations relating to sex, ex-
     tending, as it did, beyond the threshold of mar-
      riage, sapped the foundations and overthrew the
      structure of the social virtues . Father , mother,
     son and daughter, were mere words, leading to
     none ofthose delightful associations which are the
      fount from whence spring, in a tide of sparkling
      purity, the best and most hallowed of man's plea-
      sures and emotions. The links of domestic affec-
      tion-the passions which properly belong to it, are
                    " As gentle
          As zephyrs blowing beneath the violet,
                                    ""
           Not stirring its sweet head ;
     and the loss of these has shorn the homes of the
     manufacturing population of almost every thing
     which can give home a value .
       It must be understood that in pointing out a
      state ofthings, and a mode of life, happily greatly
     amended, the first manufacturers of this epoch
     must bear the blame for presenting an example ,
      to which the peculiar circumstances of the times
     gave great and immediate force . Had a high sense
     ofmoral obligations taught them to introduce strict
      discipline into their mills , by separating the sexes
      as far as possible, and by keeping a watchful eye

   upon their own passions, a very different aspect
   would now be undoubtedly presented by this
   population . The impulse being given, the
   barrier of private decency being broken down ,
   man's natural propensities , aided in their ope-
   ration by collateral causes , will long prevent a
   filling up of the breach ; and till this is done ,
    till the social virtues, till the morals of home are
   established among them , no nostrums of political
   economy, no bare intellectual education , no ex-
   tension of political rights, ever can or ever will
   make them a happy , respectable , or contented
   race of men.

     INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE AND MANNERS UPON

       -Vicious Example-Peculiarity of sexual Passions- Importance of
        propriety of Manners-Want of Attention on the Part of the Mill-

       Importance of proper sexual Restraint-Value of Refinement of

      THE crowding together numbers of the young
     of both sexes in factories, is a prolific source of
      moral delinquency The stimulus of a heated at-
     mosphere, the contact of opposite sexes , the ex-
     ample of lasciviousness upon the animal passions-
      all have conspired to produce a very early deve-
     lopment of sexual appetencies . Indeed , in this
      respect, the female population engaged in manu-

    factures , approximates very closely to that found
    in tropical climates ; puberty, or at least sexual
    propensities, being attained almost coeval with
    girlhood .
     The influence of these maturing causes is more
    strikingly seen in the female than in the male, in
    consequence of its effects being of a more promi-
    nent and observable character.
     It may be questioned whether puberty, in the
   common acceptation of the term , is necessary for
    the display and exercise of functions of sex . * Ob-
     *" The age ofpuberty amongst the Tahitians is about ten or
    eleven. The women have such early connexion with the other
    sex, that the catamenia never (that I heard of) appear before
    such connexion.
     " Some marry as young as ten ; but the average age is about
    fourteen or fifteen. Marriage takes place from twelve to six-
     teen years ; but formerly sexual intercourse began much earlier,
    and was often practised when the parties could not be more
    than six or seven. I am quite confident I am stating fact on
     this point."-Answers ofMr. Ellis and Mr. Bourne. Roberton,
    North ofEngland Medical and Surgical Journal, No. I. , p . 180 .
     " In Asiatic manners there is much to be found that is odious
    and feculent ; and ofthis the most pre-eminently disgusting part
     is the precocious acquaintance with the sexual passion which
    almost universally obtains . In allusion to the way in which
    the Hindoos train their children, the Abbé Dubois informs us
     that, from their earliest infancy , they are accustomed to scenes
    of impropriety-that it is not uncommon to see children of five
     or six years of age become familiar with discourse and action
    which would make modesty turn aside. The nudity in which
    they live for the first seven or eight years- the loose conversa-
     tion, tales and songs to which they have to listen the stories
    of the dissolute lives of their gods-the solemn festivals so
     often celebrated, where modesty is totally excluded—the abo-
     minable allusions which many of their daily practices recal-

      servation has taught , that the usual marks ac-
     companying and preceding this epoch in the
     female , have very frequently been wanting in in-
     stances where unequivocal proofs were given that
     the individuals had not only suffered , but also en-
     joyed intercourse. Not only this , but in some
     examples pregnancy has occurred , where the usual
     physiological data, generally esteemed requisite for
      its production, have been entirely wanting.
       Independently of this however , the usual accom-
     paniments of puberty shew themselves very early,
     stimulated into premature activity by the above
     causes , and unchecked in their effects upon man-
     ners by the absence of moral discipline , whether
      at home or abroad .
      So far indeed is this from [being] the [case][,][ that]
      at the mill the factory girl is subjected [to][ a][ series]
     of excitements , which inevitably lead[ to][ the][ ulti-]
     matum of desire . She can hardly be said to have
     a home-certainly she has [none] in the proper
     sense of the word-for the whole [of][ the][ day][ is]
     passed from it, and she visits it merely for the
     purpose of rest. It has no moral ties upon her ;
     and her parents are perhaps positively [injurious]
      to her in this [respect] . *
      their private and public monuments, on which nothing is ever
      represented but the most revolting obscenities—and their wor-
      ship, in which prostitutes act the principal part :-these are
      some of the polluted sources from which the youthful imagina-
      tion of the Hindoo draws its imagery."-Ibidem, p . 186 .

     The advantages resulting from the simple ob-
     servances of common propriety, may be judged of
    by the evils which attend upon their absence .
    Gross language , unrestricted allowance of word
    and deed pertaining to sexual gratification , are
    pregnant proofs of what the reality is , when
    the outward form is so debased . The peculiar
     qualities of these passions-one of the most
     striking of these being the readiness with which
    they are roused by a word, a look , or a gesture ,
    and the undying hold they take on the ima-
     gination , when once permitted to revel at large—
    render the want of some sufficient visible check
    very obvious.
      Unfortunately no regard , however slight , is
    paid to these matters by the majority of mill-
    owners . A certain number of hands are required
     to superintend the labours of their untiring engine ,
    with its complement of looms , & c . & c . , for a cer-
     situation to which we allude, for being virtuous and chaste ?
    Where they are unshackled from religious principle, as is too
     generally the case, they have no delicate sentiments ofmorality
     and taste to restrain them from gratifying every passion : they
     have few or no pleasures beyond those which arise from sensual
     indulgence- it involves no loss of character, for their com-
     panions are as reckless as themselves—it brings no risk of losing
     their employment, for their employers know that it would be
     unsafe to inquire into these matters : it is often a cause of no
     pecuniary loss, for in many cases the poor laws provide against
     this ; and all these circumstances considered , the licentiousness
     of the manufacturing population is a source of bitter lamenta-
     tion to us, but of no astonishment whatever."-Inquiry, &c.
     into the Condition of the Manufacturers, &c. p . 26.

      If the influence of temperature has been ex-
     aggerated upon these points , there is one question
     which has been neglected , in taking into account
     the causes which govern sexual maturity ; and
     that is , the customs , habits, and modes of life
     which prevail in the countries in which observa-
     tions have been made . These are, unquestionably,
     far more important agents than mere temperature ,
     both in calling into being sexual desire , and ac-
     celerating, in consequence , the period of puberty.
     It is quite needless to enter into any argument to
     prove that whatever excites the generative
     organs, will have a tendency to develope their
     specific functions ; viz . menstruation and concep-
     tion . The same remark is applicable not only to
     these organs , but to any and to every organ
     composing the human body. An attentive ex-
     amination of the writings of various travellers and
      tracted virginity. That this is not the case is abundantly
     proved by northern voyagers and travellers- witness Hearne[,]
      Franklin, Parry, Lyon, Crantz, Richardson[,] &c[.] & c[.] Parry
      declares that in no country is prostitution carried to a [greater]
      extent than among the Esquimaux- that no people[ are][ more]
      libidinous and dissolute. Mention is more than once made of
      girls of ten years of age being taken as wives . Mr. Richardson
     remarks, " that the women marry very young." Examples are
     given of wives of fourteen, sixteen, and eighteen years of age .
     -Vide Parry's first and second voyages ; Franklin's first and
      second journey; Hearne, &c. &c.-Humboldt, in speaking of
     the tribes of northern Asia, says, " that girls of ten years are
     found mothers." The evidence of Clarke and other writers
     who have visited the northern countries all agree in the same
      facts.

    observers ,* would demonstrate the accuracy of this

    sexual indulgence precedes and leads to what[ is]

    This is dependent , not so much upon any con-
    stitutional peculiarity, as upon manners which
    encourage and keep up libidinous feelings-and
    examples brought to bear upon passions so ex-
    citable and active as those having reference [to]
    sexual enjoyments are .
     It has long been noticed, that in warm coun-
    tries , and in nations still barbarous , or only in a
    state of partial civilization, very early marriages
    take place , and that women become mothers at
    a time which appears singularly premature to
    northern ideas ; at a time , indeed , when girls are
    looked upon as mere children , alike unknowing of
    and incapable ofbeing roused to sexual appetence .
    The moral and religious institutions which have
    prevailed in Great Britain , have discountenanced
    the intercourse of the sexes, till, comparatively
    speaking, a late period of life . Jurists and le-
    gislators have also lent the weight of their au-
    thority to the protraction of adult age till such

    time as it was supposed both body and mind
    would be equally matured .* These arrangements
     are, however, merely conventional ; but they have
     nevertheless produced very decided effects upon
    the physical nature of the population , by acting
    as so many powerful checks upon the display and
     early development of puberty. The germs of
     its maturity were nevertheless in being ; and ,
    were these checks removed , it is unquestionable
     that a great and striking change would take place
     in the social arrangements at present existing. †
     One of the most important advantages which
    has attended the past and present delay in ac-
    knowledging and countenancing the occurrence
    of puberty till so late a period , has been, that
    time and opportunity are given for the growth of
    those feelings of reserve and delicacy which both
    sexes have been necessarily driven to adopt for
      * The English law makes it felony to have intercourse with
     a child under ten years of age ; and a misdemeanor if above that
     age and under twelve .
      + The experience of medical men engaged in manufacturing
     towns affords evidence of this, for in these situations the [re-]
     straints of law and decency are unacknowledged[ .] A case is
     related in Mr. Roberton's paper in the North of England [Medi-]
     cal and Surgical Journal, as having occurred to a [respectable]
     surgeon, where a girl working in a cotton factory had become
     pregnant during her eleventh year, and that in all respects she
     was a full grown woman, and that the menses had [appeared]
     prior to this. Two similar cases have occurred to the author[,]
     and very many others to his professional friends[.] It is far from
    uncommon to find mothers at fifteen years of age, a period
     perhaps full as early as that in tropical countries [.]

    are subversive to so many of the[ social][ virtues] [—]

   By thus ridding the communion of all [grossness][ ,]
    the best guarantee is given for [its] moral [propriety] [.]

   condemned to the persecution of a host [of][ troubles]
    and vexations , which in the one sex ends by[ its]
    expulsion from its natural rank in the social
    confederacy .
     In speaking thus strenuously on the obser-

     relates to the morals and well -being of those sub-
     jected to their influence .
      The change in the moral and physical attri-
     butes of this population have been operated by
     temperature partly, but more especially by the
     force of example and manners already existing.
     Both are no doubt powerful agents , but there can
     be no difficulty in saying which must bear the
      principal onus of imputation. Co -operation has
     manifestly aided the effect of each separate in-
     Aluence, and has been the reason of its unex-
     ampled and rapid spread, and its permanence
     must of course depend upon the continuance or
      abstraction of the same causes.
      Temperature has done something to those who
     had been exposed to it from infancy, for from
      this period the factory labourer dates his labour.
     The manners of those around him have done
     much more in determining the precocious deve-
     lopment of sexual desire and of puberty. The
     mere fact of having been exposed from the
      earliest dawn of perception to sights and sounds
      stimulant upon passion , will easily account for
      this . Upon those who are introduced to the
      mill at or posterior to the usual age of puberty,
     temperature cannot do much ; but example, by
     producing a rush of new sensations, will be all
     powerful . In the one case then temperature aided
     by manners has been the cause of the change
     which has been produced ; in the other, manners

   and example have been the agents for perpetuating
   and extending it , and reducing all that come
   within their influence to the same condition .
   Most unfortunately as yet , no moral or religious
   check or impediment is in force to prevent [the]
    displays , necessarily resulting from this change[ ,]
    -nor are there any modifying and correcting
   agencies to lessen its mischievous tendencies[.]
    Had it been the wish of the early manufactu-
    rers to have made their workmen an orderly , mo-
    ral , and domestic race , their own example would ,
    in the first place , have been of the utmost import-
   ance . Failing in this, the next most important
   point would have been to have entrusted the over-
   looking department to individuals of good charac-
    ter and untainted morals , and of humane and
   considerate dispositions . Then the separating , as
    far as possible, the sexes, during the hours of la-
   bour, and carefully suppressing any display of
   grossness and immorality, so long as they were
   confined to the mills . Great improvements have
   and are taking place in these respects . Next, dis-
   missing or disgracing any party guilty of impro-
   per pratices ; and finally , rejecting steadily, and
    as an inviolable rule, all and every applicant for
   work who did not bring some testimony that he
   was a sober and moral person .
     These measures would have done much to-
   wards counteracting whatever forcing effects the
    temperature of their mills might have. 44 They

     would, at all events, have prevented them from
     becoming obnoxious . They would , by taking away
      other and more influential causes , urging on early
      sexual and physical development, have partially
     removed the evils ever attendant upon the crowd-
     ing together great bodies of people. Powerful
      restrictions would have also been placed upon
      that relaxation of sexual decency - that abolition
      of delicate and refined sentiments , and social ob-
      ligations, which ever lead to barbarous modes of
      living, and to the ruin of many of the fairest por-
      tions of man's character.
      They have, however, been neglected or over-
      looked , and a power which the masters might
     have exercised easily in the first instance , it
     would now be difficult if not impossible to assume .
     The numerous causes of dissension and suspicion
     which have arisen between them and the labour-
      ers , are so many impediments in the way of be-
      neficial and salutary inspection ; till these are re-
     moved, little expectation can be had of any strik-
      ing amelioration , proceeding from their interfer-
      ence . There are, however, certain changes in
      progress , that will, ere long, most probably
      enable them to do this easily and efficiently
      if, in the mean time , the volcanic elements com-
      posing the manufacturing population , do not burst
      out into active operation , and destroy the whole
      system of which they form the foundation .

    extent painful to contemplate . The exhibitions
    of the utter absence of sexual delicacy, common
    *" On the subject of the general licentiousness and illicit in-
     tercourse between the sexes, which prevails in manufacturing
     districts, we cannot, for obvious reasons, dwell so long, nor as
    minutely, as the extreme importance of the subject would justify.
    In the few words we shall devote to this branch of our inves-
     tigation, we shall be careful to keep within the limits of the
    most scrupulous accuracy, and to affirm nothing which we
    do not possess the materials for proving. First, then, we shall
    remark, that nothing but personal observation , or the testimony
    of eye-witnesses, can be relied on for satisfactory information.
    The returns of illegitimate children are worse than useless-
    for it will be obvious, on a few moments ' consideration, that in
    such cases they can afford us no possible criterion of the desired
     result. On this subject, some writers on political economy†
    betray the same ignorance as in the assertion of the extensive
    use of animal food among the manufacturing labourers . Both
     instances furnish an illustration of what appears to be a common
     source of error with them-- namely, a disposition to draw infe-
     rences from isolated facts, instead of resting their doctrines upon
    the basis of extension and accurate observation. They conclude, +
     that because the proportion of illegitimate births appears to be
     greater among agricultural than among the manufacturing
     population, the females of the former are the more immoral
     ofthe two. We draw, without doubt or hesitation , exactly the
     opposite conclusion , and every one intimately acquainted with
     the south of Lancashire will bear us out in this opinion . The
     deduction we draw is also materially confirmed by the practice
    which, it is painful to state, is far from uncommon among the
    abandoned women of these districts, of destroying , prematurely,
    the fruit and evidence of their guilt."-Enquiry, &c. p. 25.

      superficial observer. The robe of Arthur's mis-
      tress would be tried in vain on the great majority
     of the females .
       It is not denied that there are many girls who,
     from a coincidence of favourable causes , or from
      their possessing a higher and more just sense of
     what is due to themselves , escape some of the
     many evils which beset them, and grow up decent
     and moral women , fitted to make good wives and
     good mothers. These are, nevertheless, excep-
      tions ; not so rare as to be extremely remarkable ,
     but still standing out in strong relief from the
     mass to which they are attached .
      The causes which are so injurious to the fe-
     male, are operating, in a similar degree , and with
      similar force , upon the male , and produce pre-
      cisely similar effects , both upon his moral and

     It has been truly remarked by Bacon , that " the
    culture and manurance of mind in youth , hath
    such a forcible though unseen operation , as
    hardly any length of time or contention of labour,
    can countervail its influence. "
     The domestic manufacturer possessed one great
    advantage over the factory labourer[,] which was
    -that his occupation was carried on beneath [the]

     roof of his own cottage , and in the midst of
      his family also , that his children , growing up
     under his own eye , and around his fire - side , re-
     tained for him the respect and awe due to parental
     authority, by remaining members of one home
     and under the direction of one head .* By keep-
     ing up this natural and proper order of things, he
     secured one means of making his offspring do-
     mestic in their habits , and it was his own fault
      if their social character was not what it ought
     to be.
      So long as families were thus bound together
     by the strong link of interest and affection , each
     member in its turn , as it attained an age fitted for
     the loom , joined its labour to the general stock , its
      earnings forming part of a fund, the whole of
     which was placed at the disposal of the father or
     mother, as the case might be ; and each individual
     looked to him or to her for the adequate supply of
      its wants . No separate or distinct interests was
     ever acknowledged or dreamt of. If any one , by
      superior industry or skill , earned more in propor-
      tion than another, no separate claim was made
      for such excess on the part of that individual ; on
     the contrary, it was looked upon equally as a part
      of the wages ofthe family,-perhaps gratefully and
      affectionately acknowledged , but leading to no
      other result.
       This family compact, of course , existed no lon-

    ger than the usual period when [parental][ control]
    yields before the maturity of offspring. This was
    rarely before twenty-two or twenty-three [years] of
    age , and often much later. Grown up, as each
    member had , as part and parcel of a little com-
    munity, these divisions seldom took place before
    marriage opened a series of new cares and new
    prospects to son or daughter[,] which [,] in conse-
    quence seceded , or, as was frequently the case[,]
    brought a wife or husband to be joined [to][ the]
    family union . Generally, however, at this period
    an offset or branching took place[ ,] which was [best]
    for all parties.
     This preserved in all their vigour the moral
    obligations of father and mother, brother and
     sister, son and daughter, and that till a time of
     life was gained , which had given abundant oppor-
    tunity for the formation of character— a character
    most assuredly the best calculated to render the
    labouring man happy and virtuous , viz . , a do-
    mestic one ; without which, no adventitious aid
    can ever secure him their possession .
     The greatest misfortune-the most unfavour-
    able change which has resulted from factory la-
    bour, is the breaking up of these family ties ; the
    consequent abolition of the domestic circle , and
    the perversion of all the social obligations which
    should exist between parent and child on the
    one hand , and between children themselves on
    the other.
     The age at which a child became useful to its

     parents, so long as the great mass of manufactur-
     ing was manual and confined to private dwelling-
     houses, was from fourteen to sixteen. At an earlier
     age it was useful in a minor degree as winder ,
     &c.; but that was the period at which it became
     an auxiliary to the incomings of the family by
     working at the loom.
       Before this it was a mere child , entirely de-
     pendent upon the exertions of its parents [or][ older]
     brothers and sisters for support . During this
     time it was taught , by daily experieuce [,] habits of
     subordination to its seniors . The period at which
      it ranked itself by the side of the [efficient][ portions]
     of the household , was a happy medium between
     too early an application and too late a [procras-]
      tination of its physical energies [;] for the child
     was sufficiently matured , in its material [organiza-]
      tion, to bear without injury moderate and con-
     tinued exertion ; and no time had , as yet, been
     allowed for the acquirement of slothful [habits] it
     came, too, at a time when the first impulses of
     puberty were beginning to stir new associations
      in his mind . These it checked by keeping him
     occupied , while he was removed from the in-
     fluence of bad example, and laboured in an [open-]
     workshop, free from the stimulus of warmth[,] and
     in the presence of his sisters , brothers , and pa-
      rents , the very best anodyne for allaying and
     keeping in due restraint his nascent passions , -
     whilst his moral and social instincts were under a
     process of incessant cultivation [.]

   imagined that too much stress is laid upon them,
   and that the natural instincts of mankind , its
   moral tendencies , with the still higher principle ,

     the " mens divinior " are too little consulted- in
      fact, that the composition of the essence is over-
     looked in its fragrance and beauty.
      The form here , however, constitutes whatever
     there is of reality. Man cannot be taught to forget
      that he is a man, or that the breathing and blush-
     ing being before him is a woman ; that she is
     endowed like himself with an ardent tempera-
     ment-a desire for gratification ; that she has
     within and around her a world of delights which
     he is framed for and destined to enjoy ; and that
     she has passions which, if roused into activity,
     would overwhelm all sense of shame or pro-
      priety . Neither can he forget that he has a fire
     glowing within his own breast, that, if freed
     from the asbestos coating of moral decency,
     would overthrow all obstacles standing between
     him and the object of his desire , -nor that he has
     the capability of stirring into vigorous life , his
     own and woman's propensities . These he cannot
     be taught to forget the voice of nature is poten-
      tial . But he may be taught that his own welfare ,
     and more especially that of the creature before
     him , are intimately connected with the suppres-
     sion and concealment of their separate desires
     and capabilities. His sense of justice , as to what is
     due to himself, to her, and to the still wider circle
     in which he moves amongst his fellows , may be
      called into action, and thus become his own safe-
     guard, and the safe-guard of the woman, against
     the machinations of their respective passions ; and

    sphere, and have no occupation, save watching
    the passage of a thread or the revolution of a
    spindle. The mind is but little engaged , there is
   no variety for it to feed upon , -it has none of the
    pure excitements which home affords , -it be-
   comes crowded with images of the very opposite
    quality, and has its delicacy utterly and irre-
    trievably ruined , and no opportunity is given for
   the growth of modesty on the one hand , or of the
    social obligations of brother, sister, or child on
    the other .
    The next evil which removes factory labour an-
    other step still more widely apart from the con-
    dition of domestic manufacture is, that the wages
    of children have become, either by universal con-
    sent, or by the growth of disobedience , payable to
    the person earning them . This has led to another
    crying and grievous misfortune ; namely, that each
    child ceases to view itself as a subordinate agent
    in the household ; so far indeed loses the cha-
    racter and bearing of a child , that it pays over to
    its natural protector a stated sum for food and
    lodging ; thus detaching itself from parental sub-
    jection and control . The members , therefore , of
   a spinner's or weaver's family become a body of
    distinct individuals, occupying occasionally, but
   by no means universally, the same home, each
    paying its quota to the joint expenses , and con-
    sidering themselves as lodgers merely, and appro-
    priating any surplus which may remain oftheir
    wages to their own private purposes, accountable

      relates to the morals and well -being of those sub-
     jected to their influence .
      The change in the moral and physical attri-
     butes of this population have been operated by
     temperature partly, but more especially by the
      force of example and manners already existing .
     Both are no doubt powerful agents , but there can
     be no difficulty in saying which must bear the
      principal onus of imputation . Co-operation has
      manifestly aided the effect of each separate in-
     Auence , and has been the reason of its unex-
     ampled and rapid spread, and its permanence
     must of course depend upon the continuance or
      abstraction of the same causes .
       Temperature has done something to those who
     had been exposed to it from infancy, for from
      this period the factory labourer dates his labour.
     The manners of those around him have done
     much more in determining the precocious deve-
     lopment of sexual desire and of puberty . The
     mere fact of having been exposed from the
      earliest dawn of perception to sights and sounds
      stimulant upon passion , will easily account for
      this . Upon those who are introduced to the
      mill at or posterior to the usual age of puberty,
     temperature cannot do much ; but example, by
     producing a rush of new sensations , will be all
      powerful . In the one case then temperature aided
     by manners has been the cause of the change
     which has been produced ; in the other, manners

    and example have been the agents for perpetuating
    and extending it, and reducing all that come
    within their influence to the same condition .
    Most unfortunately as yet , no moral or religious
    check or impediment is in force to prevent the
    displays, necessarily resulting from this change ,
    -nor are there any modifying and correcting
    agencies to lessen its mischievous tendencies.
     Had it been the wish of the early manufactu-
     rers to have made their workmen an orderly , mo-
     ral , and domestic race , their own example would ,
     in the first place , have been of the utmost import-
    ance. Failing in this, the next most important
    'point would have been to have entrusted the over-
    looking department to individuals of good charac-
    ter and untainted morals , and of humane and
    considerate dispositions . Then the separating, as
     far as possible, the sexes , during the hours of la-
    bour, and carefully suppressing any display of
    grossness and immorality, so long as they were
    confined to the mills . Great improvements have
    and are taking place in these respects . Next , dis-
    missing or disgracing any party guilty of impro-
    per pratices ; and finally, rejecting steadily , and
    as an inviolable rule , all and every applicant for
    work who did not bring some testimony that he
    was a sober and moral person .
     These measures would have done much to-
    wards counteracting whatever forcing effects the
    temperature of their mills might have. They

    stances already detailed , are in full and undisguised

    shewing themselves at a very early age, and to an
    extent painful to contemplate . The exhibitions
    of the utter absence of sexual delicacy, common
     *" On the subject of the general licentiousness and illicit in-
    tercourse between the sexes, which prevails in manufacturing
     districts, we cannot, for obvious reasons, dwell so long, nor as
    minutely, as the extreme importance of the subject would justify.
    In the few words we shall devote to this branch of our inves-
    tigation, we shall be careful to keep within the limits of the
    most scrupulous accuracy, and to affirm nothing which we
    do not possess the materials for proving. First, then, we shall
    remark, that nothing but personal observation, or the testimony
    of eye-witnesses , can be relied on for satisfactory information.
    The returns of illegitimate children are worse than useless-
    for it will be obvious, on a few moments' consideration, that in
    such cases they can afford us no possible criterion of the desired
    result. On this subject, some writers on political economy+
    betray the same ignorance as in the assertion of the extensive
    use of animal food among the manufacturing labourers. Both
    instances furnish an illustration of what appears to be a common
    source of error with them-- namely, a disposition to draw infe-
    rences from isolated facts, instead of resting their doctrines upon
    the basis of extension and accurate observation . They conclude,
    that because the proportion of illegitimate births appears to be
    greater among agricultural than among the manufacturing
    population, the females of the former are the more immoral
    of the two. We draw, without doubt or hesitation, exactly the
    opposite conclusion, and every one intimately acquainted with
    the south of Lancashire will bear us out in this opinion . The
    deduction we draw is also materially confirmed by the practice
    which, it is painful to state, is far from uncommon among the
    abandoned women of these districts, of destroying, prematurely,
    the fruit and evidence of their guilt."-Enquiry, &c. p . 25.

     in manufacturing towns , are notorious to the most
     superficial observer. The robe of Arthur's mis-
     tress would be tried in vain on the great majority
     of the females .
       It is not denied that there are many girls who,
     from a coincidence of favourable causes , or from
     their possessing a higher and more just sense of
     what is due to themselves , escape some of the
     many evils which beset them, and grow up decent
     and moral women , fitted to make good wives and
     good mothers . These are, nevertheless, excep-
     tions ; not so rare as to be extremely remarkable ,
     but still standing out in strong relief from the
     mass to which they are attached .
      The causes which are so injurious to the fe-
     male , are operating, in a similar degree , and with
     similar force, upon the male, and produce pre-
     cisely similar effects , both upon his moral and

          CHAPTER III.
    THE INFLUENCE OF THE SEPARATION OF [FAMILIES] [,] &[c][.]
     UPON THE MORAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE
     MANUFACTURING POPULATION [.]

      and Advantages-No Child - labour- Effects of this upon [the] [Male]
      and Female Portion of his Household described- Factory Labour-
       Destruction of Home- Separation of Families-Effects of these

      It has been truly remarked by Bacon , that " the
     culture and manurance of mind in youth , hath
    such a forcible though unseen operation , as
     hardly any length of time or contention of labour,
    can countervail its influence ."
     The domestic manufacturer possessed one great
    advantage over the factory labourer, which was
    -that his occupation was carried on beneath the

```
     roof of his own cottage , and in the midst of
      his family also , that his children , growing up
     under his own eye , and around his fire - side , re-
     tained for him the respect and awe due to parental
     authority, by remaining members of one home
     and under the direction of one head .* By keep-
     ing up this natural and proper order of things , he
     secured one means of making his offspring do-
     mestic in their habits , and it was his own fault
      if their social character was not what it ought
      to be.
      So long as families were thus bound together
     by the strong link of interest and affection , each
     member in its turn , as it attained an age fitted for
     the loom , joined its labour to the general stock , its
     earnings forming part of a fund, the whole of
     which was placed at the disposal of the father or
     mother, as the case might be ; and each individual
     looked to him or to her for the adequate supply of
      its wants . No separate or distinct interests was
     ever acknowledged or dreamt of. If any one, by
      superior industry or skill , earned more in propor-
      tion than another, no separate claim was made
      for such excess on the part of that individual ; on
     the contrary, it was looked upon equally as a part
     of the wages ofthe family, -perhaps gratefully and
      affectionately acknowledged , but leading to no
      other result.
       This family compact, of course , existed no lon-

    ger than the usual period when parental control
    yields before the maturity of offspring. This was
    rarely before twenty-two or twenty-three years of
    age, and often much later. Grown up, as each
    member had , as part and parcel of a little com-
    munity, these divisions seldom took place before
    marriage opened a series of new cares and new
    prospects to son or daughter, which, in conse-
    quence seceded , or, as was frequently the case ,
    brought a wife or husband to be joined to the
    family union . Generally , however, at this period
    an offset or branching took place , which was best
    for all parties.
     This preserved in all their vigour the moral
    obligations of father and mother, brother and
     sister, son and daughter, and that till a time of
     life was gained , which had given abundant oppor-
    tunity for the formation of character-a character
    most assuredly the best calculated to render the
    labouring man happy and virtuous , viz ., a do-
    mestic one ; without which, no adventitious aid
    can ever secure him their possession .
     The greatest misfortune-the most unfavour-
    able change which has resulted from factory la-
    bour, is the breaking up of these family ties ; the
    consequent abolition of the domestic circle , and
    the perversion of all the social obligations which
    should exist between parent and child on the
    one hand, and between children themselves on
    the other .
     The age at which a child became useful to its

```

-----

```
      parents, so long as the great mass of manufactur-
      ing was manual and confined to private dwelling-
      houses, was from fourteen to sixteen . At an earlier
      age it was useful in a minor degree as winder ,
     &c.; but that was the period at which it became
      an auxiliary to the incomings of the family by
      working at the loom.
        Before this it was a mere child , entirely de-
      pendent upon the exertions of its parents or older
      brothers and sisters for support . During this
      time it was taught, by daily experieuce , habits of
      subordination to its seniors . The period at which
       it ranked itself by the side of the efficient portions
      of the household , was a happy medium between
      too early an application and too late a procras-
       tination of its physical energies ; for the child
      was sufficiently matured , in its material organiza-
      tion, to bear without injury moderate and con-
      tinued exertion ; and no time had , as yet, been
      allowed for the acquirement of slothful habits it
      came, too, at a time when the first impulses of
      puberty were beginning to stir new associations
      in his mind . These it checked by keeping him
      occupied, while he was removed from the in-
      fluence of bad example , and laboured in an open-
      workshop, free from the stimulus of warmth , and
      in the presence of his sisters , brothers , and pa-
      rents , --- the very best anodyne for allaying and
      keeping in due restraint his nascent passions , -
      whilst his moral and social instincts were under a
      process of incessant cultivation .

```
    The same observations apply with still greater
   force to the females of the family . With them
   labour commenced at a somewhat earlier period ,
   or they supplied the place of their mother in the
   household offices , leaving her at liberty to work
   for their sustenance, if such a course of proceed-
   ing was deemed necessary, or forced upon them
   by the pressure of circumstances . Whichever it
   was, she was kept from promiscuous intercourse
   with the other sex, at an age when it was to her
   of the utmost importance - her young sensibilities
   rendering her peculiarly liable to powerful and
    irresistible impressions . * It is true that the sports
   of her own sex were to some extent libidinous ; but
   to these she was not admitted till a much later
   period ; and these , though coarse and highly ob-
   jectionable, rarely ended in mischief, being con-
    sidered as a sort of prelude to marriage, uni-
   versally existing amongst them-a custom most
    certainly " more honoured in the breach than in
   the observance . "
    Her occupations and feelings were therefore
    exclusively home -bred , and no idea existed that
    distinct or detached interests could intervene be-
    twixt her parents and herself.
     It is in these respects that the family of the
    factory labourers offers such strong contrasts and
   unhappy differences .
     In the first place , there is no home labour. It

     becomes therefore a mere shelter, in which their
     meals are hastily swallowed , and which offers them
     repose for the night. It has no endearing re-
      collections which bind it on their memories- no
     hold upon their imaginations .
       In the next place , the various members not only
     do not labour under their own roof, but they do
     not labour in common , neither in one mill ; or
      if in one mill , so separated , that they have no
     opportunity of exchanging a single glance or a
     word throughout the long hours they are engaged
      there. Children are thus entirely removed from
     parental guardianship ; --and not only so , but they
     are brought into immediate contact with parties ,
     generally of their own age , equally removed with
     themselves from inspection , and equally un-
     checked by a consciousness that the eye of a
     brother, sister, or parent may be fixed upon
     them . They are placed , too , under the control of
     an overlooker, who from a sense of duty to his em-
     ployer, if aggravated by no baser feeling, treats
     them frequently with harshness , often with brutal
      coarseness, making no allowance for childish sim-
      plicity, bashfulness , delicacy, or female failings ;
     and this is most fatal to self-esteem , -for no-
     thing so soon injures or destroys this , as unworthy
     treatment, suffered in themselves or witnessed
     in others , without the power of redress or even
     of [appeal] .
      Again , they are subjected on all sides to the

    sphere, and have no occupation , save watching
    the passage of a thread or the revolution of a
    spindle . The mind is but little engaged [,] there [is]
    no variety for it to feed upon[ ,] -it has [none][ of][ the]
    pure excitements which home affords , -it be-
    comes crowded with images of the very [opposite]
    quality, and has its delicacy utterly and irre-
    trievably ruined , and no opportunity [is][ given][ for]
    the growth of modesty on the one hand[ ,][ or of][ the]
     social obligations of brother[,] sister [,] or[ child][ on]
    the other .
     The next evil which removes factory labour an-
    other step still more widely apart from the con-
    dition of domestic manufacture is , that the wages
    of children have become , either by universal con-
    sent, or by the growth of disobedience , payable to
    the person earning them . This has led to another
    crying and grievous misfortune ; namely, that each
    child ceases to view itself as a subordinate agent
    in the household ; so far indeed loses the cha-
     racter and bearing of a child , that it pays over to
     its natural protector a stated sum for food and
    lodging ; thus detaching itself from parental sub-
    jection and control . The members , therefore, of
    a spinner's or weaver's family become a body of
     distinct individuals , occupying occasionally, but
    by no means universally, the same home , each
    paying its quota to the joint expenses, and con-
     sidering themselves as lodgers merely, and appro-
     priating any surplus which may remain oftheir
    wages to their own private purposes , accountable

      repose for the night. It has no endearing re-
       collections which bind it on their memories- no
      hold upon their imaginations.
       In the next place , the various members not only
      do not labour under their own roof, but they do
      not labour in common , neither in one mill ; or
       if in one mill , so separated , that they have no
      opportunity of exchanging a single glance or a
      word throughout the long hours they are engaged
      there . Children are thus entirely removed from
      parental guardianship ; --and not only so, but they
      are brought into immediate contact with parties ,
      generally of their own age, equally removed with
      themselves from inspection , and equally un-
      checked by a consciousness that the eye of a
      brother, sister, or parent may be fixed upon
      them . They are placed , too , under the control of
      an overlooker, who from a sense of duty to his em-
      ployer, if aggravated by no baser feeling, treats
      them frequently with harshness , often with brutal
      coarseness, making no allowance for childish sim-
       plicity, bashfulness, delicacy , or female failings ;
      and this is most fatal to self-esteem,-for no-
      thing so soon injures or destroys this, as unworthy
      treatment, suffered in themselves or witnessed
      in others , without the power of redress or even
      of [appeal] .

     would , at all events, have prevented them from
      becoming obnoxious . They would , by taking away
      other and more influential causes , urging on early
      sexual and physical development, have partially
      removed the evils ever attendant upon the crowd-
      ing together great bodies of people. Powerful
       restrictions would have also been placed upon
      that relaxation of sexual decency -that abolition
      of delicate and refined sentiments , and social ob-
       ligations, which ever lead to barbarous modes of
       living, and to the ruin of many of the fairest por-
      tions of man's character.
       They have, however, been neglected or [over-]

     stances already detailed , are in full and undisguised

     extent painful to contemplate . The exhibitions
     of the utter absence of sexual delicacy, common
      *" On the subject of the general licentiousness and illicit in-
     tercourse between the sexes, which prevails in manufacturing
      districts, we cannot, for obvious reasons, dwell so long, nor as
     minutely, as the extreme importance of the subject would justify.
     In the few words we shall devote to this branch of our inves-
     tigation, we shall be careful to keep within the limits of the
     most scrupulous accuracy, and to affirm nothing which we
     do not possess the materials for proving . First, then, we shall
     remark, that nothing but personal observation , or the testimony
     of eye-witnesses, can be relied on for satisfactory information.
     The returns of illegitimate children are worse than useless-
     for it will be obvious , on a few moments' consideration, that in
     such cases they can afford us no possible criterion of the desired
     result. On this subject, some writers on political economy†
     betray the same ignorance as in the assertion of the extensive
     use of animal food among the manufacturing labourers . Both
     instances furnish an illustration of what appears to be a common
     source of error with them-- namely, a disposition to draw infe-
     rences from isolated facts, instead of resting their doctrines upon
     the basis of extension and accurate observation. They conclude,
     that because the proportion of illegitimate births appears to be
     greater among agricultural than among the manufacturing
     population, the females of the former are the more immoral
     of the two. We draw, without doubt or hesitation , exactly the
     opposite conclusion , and every one intimately acquainted with
     the south of Lancashire will bear us out in this opinion . The
     deduction we draw is also materially confirmed by the practice
     which, it is painful to state, is far from uncommon among the
     abandoned women of these districts, of destroying , prematurely,
     the fruit and evidence of their guilt . "-Enquiry, &c . p . 25.

      in manufacturing towns , are notorious to the most
      superficial observer. The robe of Arthur's mis-
      tress would be tried in vain on the great majority
      of the females .
       It is not denied that there are many girls who,
     from a coincidence of favourable causes , or from
      their possessing a higher and more just sense of
     what is due to themselves , escape some of the
     many evils which beset them , and grow up decent
     and moral women , fitted to make good wives and
     good mothers. These are, nevertheless , excep-
      tions ; not so rare as to be extremely remarkable ,
     but still standing out in strong relief from the
     mass to which they are attached .
      The causes which are so injurious to the fe-
     male , are operating, in a similar degree, and with
      similar force , upon the male, and produce pre-
      cisely similar effects , both upon his moral and
      physical organization .

           CHAPTER III .
     THE INFLUENCE OF THE SEPARATION OF [FAMILIES][,][ &][c][.]
     UPON THE MORAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF [THE]
      MANUFACTURING POPULATION [.]
      Domestic Manufacturer- Union of his Family-Its Consequences
       and Advantages-No Child -labour- Effects of this upon the Male
       and Female Portion of his Household described- Factory Labour-
       Destruction of Home- Separation of Families-Effects of these
       upon social Character- Payment of Wages to Children, its Evils
       described-Conversion of Homes into Lodging -houses- Loss of do-
       mestic Virtues, description of—Early Period at which Factory La-
       bour begins-The Mind, &c . of Childhood-Division of Families-
       Cultivation of Home Affections-Infancy of the Factory Child
       described Comparison of the Condition of the Agricultural La-
       bourer- Its Advantages- Domestic Economy- Non-existence of, in
       the Factory Woman- Separation of Man and Wife .
      It has been truly remarked by Bacon , that " the
     culture and manurance of mind in youth , hath
     such a forcible though unseen operation , as
     hardly any length of time or contention of labour,
     can countervail its influence ."
      The domestic manufacturer possessed one great
     advantage over the factory labourer, which was
     -that his occupation was carried on beneath the

      roof of his own cottage, and in the midst of
      his family also , that his children , growing up
     under his own eye , and around his fire - side , re-
      tained for him the respect and awe due to parental
      authority, by remaining members of one home
     and under the direction of one head .* By keep-
      ing up this natural and proper order of things , he
      secured one means of making his offspring do-
      mestic in their habits, and it was his own fault
      if their social character was not what it ought
      to be.
      So long as families were thus bound together
     by the strong link of interest and affection , each
     member in its turn , as it attained an age fitted for
     the loom , joined its labour to the general stock , its
      earnings forming part of a fund, the whole of
     which was placed at the disposal of the father or
     mother, as the case might be ; and each individual
      looked to him or to her for the adequate supply of
       its wants. No separate or distinct interests was
      ever acknowledged or dreamt of. If any one , by
      superior industry or skill, earned more in propor-
      tion than another, no separate claim was made
      for such excess on the part of that individual ; on
      the contrary, it was looked upon equally as a part
      of the wages ofthe family,—perhaps gratefully and
      affectionately acknowledged , but leading to no
      other result .
       This family compact, of course , existed no lon-

    ger than the usual period when parental control
    yields before the maturity of offspring . This was
    rarely before twenty - two or twenty-three years of
    age, and often much later. Grown up, as each
    member had , as part and parcel of a little com-
    munity, these divisions seldom took place before
    marriage opened a series of new cares and new
    prospects to son or daughter, which, in conse-
    quence seceded , or, as was frequently the case,
    brought a wife or husband to be joined to the
    family union . Generally , however, at this period
    an offset or branching took place, which was best
    for all parties.
     This preserved in all their vigour the moral
     obligations of father and mother , brother and
     sister, son and daughter, and that till a time of
     life was gained , which had given abundant oppor-
    tunity for the formation of character- a character
    most assuredly the best calculated to render the
    labouring man happy and virtuous , viz ., a do-
    mestic one ; without which, no adventitious aid
    can ever secure him their possession .
     The greatest misfortune-the most unfavour-
    able change which has resulted from factory la-
    bour, is the breaking up of these family ties ; the
    consequent abolition of the domestic circle , and
    the perversion of all the social obligations which
    should exist between parent and child on the
    one hand, and between children themselves on
    the other.
     The age at which a child became useful to its

      parents, so long as the great mass of manufactur-
      ing was manual and confined to private dwelling-
      houses , was from fourteen to sixteen . At an earlier
      age it was useful in a minor degree as winder ,
     & c.; but that was the period at which it became
     an auxiliary to the incomings of the family by
     working at the loom .
       Before this it was a mere child , entirely de-
      pendent upon the exertions of its parents or older
      brothers and sisters for support. During this
     time it was taught, by daily experieuce , habits of
      subordination to its seniors . The period at which
       it ranked itself by the side of the efficient portions
      of the household , was a happy medium between
      too early an application and too late a procras-
      tination of its physical energies ; for the child
     was sufficiently matured , in its material organiza-
      tion, to bear without injury moderate and con-
      tinued exertion ; and no time had , as yet , been
      allowed for the acquirement of slothful habits it
     came, too, at a time when the first impulses of
      puberty were beginning to stir new associations
      in his mind . These it checked by keeping him
      occupied , while he was removed from the in-
      fluence of bad example, and laboured in an open-
     workshop, free from the stimulus of warmth , and
      in the presence of his sisters , brothers, and pa-
      rents , the very best anodyne for allaying and
     keeping in due restraint his nascent passions, —
      whilst his moral and social instincts were under a
      process of incessant cultivation .

     The same observations apply with still greater
    force to the females of the family . With them
    labour commenced at a somewhat earlier period ,
    or they supplied the place of their mother in the
    household offices , leaving her at liberty to work
     for their sustenance, if such a course of proceed-
    ing was deemed necessary , or forced upon them
    by the pressure of circumstances . Whichever it
    was , she was kept from promiscuous intercourse
     with the other sex , at an age when it was to her
    of the utmost importance - her young sensibilities
     rendering her peculiarly liable to powerful and
     irresistible impressions . * It is true that the sports
     of her own sex were to some extent libidinous ; but
     to these she was not admitted till a much later
     period ; and these , though coarse and highly ob-
     jectionable, rarely ended in mischief, being con-
     sidered as a sort of prelude to marriage , uni-
     versally existing amongst them-a custom most
     certainly " more honoured in the breach than in
     the observance . "
      Her occupations and feelings were therefore
     exclusively home-bred , and no idea existed that
     distinct or detached interests could intervene be-
     twixt her parents and herself.
       It is in these respects that the family of the
     factory labourers offers such strong contrasts and
     unhappy differences .

     becomes therefore a mere shelter, in which their
     meals are hastily swallowed , and which offers them
      repose for the night. It has no endearing re-
      collections which bind it on their memories- no
     hold upon their imaginations .
       In the next place, the various members not only
     do not labour under their own roof, but they do
      not labour in common , neither in one mill ; or
      if in one mill , so separated , that they have no
      opportunity of exchanging a single glance or a
     word throughout the long hours they are engaged
      there. Children are thus entirely removed from
      parental guardianship ; --and not only so, but they
      are brought into immediate contact with parties,
      generally of their own age, equally removed with
     themselves from inspection , and equally un-
     checked by a consciousness that the eye of a
      brother, sister , or parent may be fixed upon

     them frequently with harshness, often with brutal
      coarseness, making no allowance for childish sim-
      plicity, bashfulness , delicacy, or female failings ;
     and this is most fatal to self-esteem , -for no-
      thing so soon injures or destroys this , as unworthy
     treatment, suffered in themselves or witnessed
      in others , without the power of redress or even

    sphere, and have no occupation , save watching
    the passage of a thread or the revolution of a
     spindle . The mind is but little engaged , there is
    no variety for it to feed upon [,] -it has none of the
    pure excitements which home affords , -it be-
    comes crowded with images of the very opposite
     quality, and has its delicacy utterly and irre-
     trievably ruined , and no opportunity is given [for]
     the growth of modesty on the one hand[ ,][ or] [of][ the]
     social obligations of brother, sister, or child on
     the other.
     The next evil which removes factory labour an-
     other step still more widely apart from the con-
     dition of domestic manufacture is , that the wages
    of children have become , either by universal con-
     sent, or by the growth of disobedience , payable to
     the person earning them . This has led to another
     crying and grievous misfortune ; namely, that each
     child ceases to view itself as a subordinate agent
     in the household ; so far indeed loses the cha-
     racter and bearing of a child , that it pays over to
      its natural protector a stated sum for food and
     lodging ; thus detaching itself from parental sub-
     jection and control . The members , therefore, of
    a spinner's or weaver's family become a body of
     distinct individuals , occupying occasionally, but
    by no means universally, the same home, each
     paying its quota to the joint expenses , and con-
     sidering themselves as lodgers merely, and appro-
     priating any surplus which may remain oftheir
     wages to their own private purposes , accountable

     to no one for the mode in which it happens to be
     used or wasted .
       It is to be feared , that the mischiefs resulting
     from such an unnatural arrangement, must , in the
      first instance , be saddled upon the errors of pa-
      rents- such a dereliction from filial duty being
     hardly likely to happen spontaneously on the side
     of the children ; and that a plan originally adopted
     in a few cases, by the family of idle and depraved
     parents , *- and many such are to be found , who
     would willingly batten upon the toil of their chil-
     dren- has become general , in consequence of the
     lowering in the reciprocal confidence and affection
     which ought to exist between parent and child .
      In numerous examples then [,] at the [present] day[,]
     parents are thus become the keepers of [lodging-]
     houses for their offspring, between whom little
     intercourse beyond that relating to pecuniary pro-
      fit and loss is carried on . In a vast number of
     others , children have been entirely driven away
     from their homes , either by unnatural treatment [,]
     or have voluntarily deserted them[ ,] and taken up
      their abode in other asylums , for the sake of
     saving a small sum in the amount of payment[ re-]
     quired for food and house- room [.]
      This disruption of all the ties of home, is one of
     the most fatal consequences of the factory system .

      ample opportunities of employment , is supported in idleness on

    The social relations which should distinguish the
    members ofthe same family, are destroyed . The
    domestic virtues- man's natural instincts , and the
     affections of the heart, are deadened and lost.
    Those feelings and actions which should be the
    charm of the fire- side-which should prepare
    young men and young women for fulfilling the
     duties of parents , are displaced by a selfishness
     utterly repugnant to all such sacred obligations .
    Tenderness of manner- solicitude during sickness

     are lost, and their place occupied by individual

     rarely before twenty -two or twenty-three years of

     family union . Generally, however, at this period
     an offset or branching took place , which was best
     for all parties.
      This preserved in all their vigour the moral
     obligations of father and mother, brother and
      sister, son and daughter, and that till a time of
      life was gained , which had given abundant oppor-
     tunity for the formation of character- a character
     most assuredly the best calculated to render the
     labouring man happy and virtuous, viz ., a do-
     mestic one ; without which, no adventitious aid
     can ever secure him their possession .
      The greatest misfortune-the most unfavour-
     able change which has resulted from factory la-
     bour, is the breaking up of these family ties ; the
     consequent abolition of the domestic circle , and
     the perversion of all the social obligations which
     should exist between parent and child on the
     one hand , and between children themselves on
     the other.

      repose for the night. It has no endearing re-

       In the next place , the various members not only
     do not labour under their own roof, but they do
      not labour in common , neither in one mill ; or
      if in one mill , so separated , that they have no
      opportunity of exchanging a single glance or a
     word throughout the long hours they are engaged
      there . Children are thus entirely removed from
      parental guardianship ; --and not only so, but they
      are brought into immediate contact with parties ,
      generally of their own age, equally removed with
      themselves from inspection , and equally un-
      checked by a consciousness that the eye of a
      brother, sister, or parent may be fixed upon
     them . They are placed , too , under the control of

    sphere, and have no occupation , save watching
    the passage of a thread or the revolution of a
    spindle. The mind is but little engaged [,] there [is]
    no variety for it to feed upon [,] -it has [none][ of][ the]
    pure excitements which home affords , -it be-
    comes crowded with images of the very [opposite]

    the growth of modesty on the one hand[ ,][ or][ of][ the]
     social obligations of brother[,] sister, or child on
    the other.
     The next evil which removes [factory] [labour][ an-]
    other step still more widely apart from the con-
     dition of domestic manufacture is, that the [wages]
    of children have become [,] either by [universal] [con-]
     sent, or by the growth of disobedience[ ,][ payable][ to]
    the person earning them [.] This has led to another
    crying and grievous misfortune [;] namely[,][ that][ each]
     child ceases to view itself as a subordinate [agent]
     in the household ; so far indeed [loses] [the][ cha-]
     racter and bearing of a child [,] that [it] pays [over][ to]
     its natural protector a stated sum [for] [food][ and]
     lodging ; thus detaching itself from parental sub-
     jection and control . The members, therefore, of
    a spinner's or weaver's family become [a][ body][ of]

    by no means universally[,] the same home[,][ each]
     paying its quota to the joint expenses[ ,][ and][ con-]

      to no one for the mode in which it happens to be
      used or wasted .
       It is to be feared , that the mischiefs resulting
      from such an unnatural arrangement, must, in the
       first instance , be saddled upon the errors of [pa-]
      rents- such a dereliction from filial duty being
      hardly likely to happen spontaneously on the [side]
      of the children ; and that a plan originally adopted
      in a few cases, by the family of idle and depraved
      parents, *- and many such are to be found [,] who
     would willingly batten upon the toil of their chil-
      dren-has become general , in consequence of the
      lowering in the reciprocal confidence and affection
     which ought to exist between parent and child[ .]
       In numerous examples then , at the [present] day[,]
      parents are thus become the keepers of [lodging-]
      houses for their offspring, between whom little
      intercourse beyond that relating to pecuniary pro-
       fit and loss is carried on [.] In a vast number of
      others , children have been entirely driven away
      from their homes , either by unnatural treatment [,]
      or have voluntarily deserted them [,] and taken [up]
      their abode in other asylums , for the sake of
      saving a small sum in the amount of payment re-
      quired for food and house -room.

      the most fatal consequences of the factory system .

    The social relations which should distinguish the
    members ofthe same family , are destroyed . The
    domestic virtues-man's natural instincts , and the
    affections of the heart , are deadened and lost .
    Those feelings and actions which should be the
    charm of the fire- side- which should prepare
    young men and young women for fulfilling the
    duties of parents , are displaced by a selfishness
    utterly repugnant to all such sacred obligations.
    Tenderness of manner-solicitude during sickness
    -the foregoing of personal gratification for the sake
    of others -- submission to home restraint- all these
     are lost , and their place occupied by individual
    independence- private avarice-the withholding

    of the more delicate shades of character, which
     render home a world of pleasures , leaving nothing

      conflicting individuals, each striving for their
     " own hand ," uninfluenced , unmodified by the
     more gentle , the more noble, and the more hu-
     manized cares, aspirations and feelings, which
      could alone render them estimable as fathers , mo-
      thers, brothers and sisters .
      When it is borne in mind, at what an early pe-
      riod of life this separation of family takes place,
       its effects will be better and more correctly appre-
      ciated , and the permanence of the injurious im-
      pression produced by it, will be more clearly
     comprehended .
       Factory labour, in many of its processes, re-
      quires little else but manual dexterity, and no
      physical strength ; neither is there any thing for
      the mind to do in it ; so that children , whose fin-
      gers are taught to move with great facility and
      rapidity, have all the requisites for it . Hence
     one reasonfor introducing mere infants into mills ,
     though this is by no means the only one ; and
     were the hours of labour sufficiently limited , and
     under proper regulation , when the present habits
      of their parents are considered , the evil-great in
     some respects as it is- would almost cease to be
     one. Children from nine to twelve years of age,
      are now become part of the staple hands , and are
      consequently subjected at this tender period to
       all the mischiefs incident to the condition of the
      older work-people.
        It may be urged , that the mind of a child at this

    age, cannot, from its very structure and previous
    impressions, be susceptible of the more vicious
    and immoral parts of the system ; and that its
    previous education, which it is presumed must
    have been home , will , to some extent, guard it
    against evil communications .
      It has been truly observed , and not the less
    beautifully than truly, that " heaven is around us
    in our infancy." This might have been extended ,
    and said , that " heaven is around and within us
    in our infancy ;" for the happiness of childhood
    springs full as much from an internal conscious-
    ness of delight, as from the novelty of its impres-
    sions from without . Its mind , providing the pas-
    sions are properly guided , is indeed a swelling
    fountain of all that is beautiful-all that is amiable ;
    -overflowing with joy and tenderness ; and its
    young heart is a living laboratory of love , formed
    to be profusely scattered on all around it.
     The very copiousness of its sensations , however,
    prevents stability in their direction , if not carefully
    tended-and if its heart and mind have capabili-
    ties for exhibiting and lavishing the treasures of
    their awakening energies , they are , from their very
    immaturity , more easily warped and misdirected
    The hacknied quotation, " just as the twig is
    bent," &c. , is not the less true for being hacknied .
    Most unhappily, every thing which goes on before
    the eyes of the unfortunate factory children , is
    but too well calculated to nip in the bud-to wi-
    ther in the spring time of its growth-the flower

     which was springing up within them, to adorn
     and beautify their future existence --and in its
     stead to bring forth an unsightly mass of ill-as-
     sorted and rugged excrescences , equally hateful
      to sight and injurious to the parent stem .
      The independence assumed by older brothers
     and sisters, the total inattention to parental re-
     monstrance or wishes , soon produce their influence
     upon a child-which is quite as ready to learn evil
     as good. Then , driven at the early age it is , into
     the mill , and at once placed amongst crowds of
     children similarly circumstanced with itself, the
     impressions made upon it at home soon become
     permanent. The subsequent possession of money,
     with the bickerings that arise therefrom, alien-
     ate any spark of affection which might still be
     lingering in its breast for its parents , and when a
     mere infant, it establishes itself either as an inde-
     pendent inmate of its paternal dwelling, or seeks
     out a lodging with other parties , as the case may
     happen to be.
      The existence of a divided interest in a house-
     hold , whether the division is between man and
     wife, or between parent and child , is alike fatal
      to its best interests . No home can ever be what
      it ought without proper government, or where
      all the inmates are on such terms of equa-
      lity as to give to each an equal right to the
      direction of the whole-and even a household so
     constituted will not hang long together . In the
     homes of the manufacturing population , the divi-

      sions between parents and children , arising from
     the assumption of managing their own earnings ,
      so generally acknowledged amongst them, de-
     prives them of the most valuable portion of their
     influence .
      Thus, whether at home or abroad , unfettered
     by wholesome restraints , the factory child grows
     up, acquiring vices of all shades , and utterly
      losing that which might render its condition one
     of respectability and comfort--the social and do-
     mestic virtues . Year after year rolls on , unfitting
      it more and more for the best purposes of life,
     and if it should become a parent, it transmits to
      its offspring the evils of a system of which it has
     been the victim .
      The entire breaking up of households , which is
     an inevitable consequence of mill-labour, as it
     now exists, is one which may be regarded as the
     most powerfully demoralizing agent attendant
     upon it. This is , however, aided by many other
     causes, some of which have been already de-
      scribed , and others will be noticed in the course
     of the work. * The domestic affections, if they
     are to assume strength, must be steadily cultivat-
     ed , and cultivated , too , in the only way of which
     they are capable. This is by parental kindness
     in the first place, which , by rendering home plea-
     sant, and weaving its delightful associations in

    the young imagination, forms one of the most
     sacred , most delightful, and most permanent feel-
     ings of the human heart. In the next place, the
    example of proper household subordination , for
    without this the first will be destroyed , or so
    weakened as to be inefficient and inoperative.
     Neither of these agents are brought to bear
     actively and properly upon the factory child .
    From its birth it sees nothing around it but dis-
     sension ; its infant cries are hushed, not by ma-
     ternal tenderness , but by doses of gin or opiates ,
     or it is left to wail itself asleep from exhaustion .
    In thousands of cases it is abandoned through-
     out the day by its parents , both of whom are
     egaged in the mill, and left to the care of a stranger
     or a mere child* -badly used - badly fed- its little
     heart hardened by harshness even in the cradle ;
     then badly clothed-unattended during its growth
    by regular and systematic kindness-constantly
     hearing execrations , curses , blasphemy, and every
     thing coarse and obscene in expression-seeing
     on all sides strife , drunkenness , beastiality, and
     abominations , and finally sent shivering into the
     mill, to swell the hordes of children which have
     been similarly educated , and similarly abandoned
     to their own resources.
      It may be said, that the agricultural labourer is
     subjected to a separation from his family, and that
     the members of his family are also , after a time,
     separated from home This is granted , and that,

     thus, prima facie, he appears circumstanced in
      these respects like the factory labourer[.] Nothing
     can, however, be more dissimilar than the two
      cases , when looked at in their true bearings[ .]
      The agricultural labourer, it is true , pursues his
     occupation from home-but he pursues it in nine
      cases out of ten solitarily, or ifhe works in company,
       it is in small gangs ; he works too in an atmo-
      sphere natural in its temperature , and favourable
      to bodily health , saying nothing of the moral in-
      fluences of the sights and sounds which are his
      familiar companions ; his labour is physically se-
      vere, and is just sufficient to require what intel-
      lectual capacity he generally possesses ; his diet
      is plain and wholesome ; he is freed from the ex-
     ample of many vices, by his situation, to which
     the factory labourer is exposed , and his habits and
     modes of life are simpler and purer. His family,
      separated from each other, and from home after a
      time, remain long enough under the paternal
      roof to have acquired some notion of domestic
      discipline , and that too under the best of all possible
      teachers a mother, whose avocations are exclu-
      sively household . The labour of the sons , when
      old enough to pursue it , which is not till sixteen
      years of age , is that of the father, under similar
      circumstances. The daughters become household
      servants, either to persons of their own class , or ,
     what is more general , in the houses of respectable
      families in the neighbourhood , or seek service in

    the surrounding towns and villages ; their family
     interest thus, of course, merging in that of their
    employers. In all these cases a strict watch is
    kept over their morals .† No point of similarity
     exists then between them , except in the single one
     of separation of families , and that too at a period
    and in a way to be as little injurious as possible
     to the moral character of the parties.
     The agricultural labourer has other moral ad-
     vantages over those possessed by the manufac-
     turing one. He is frequently under the direct
     inspection of his employer, in the middle class of
     land proprietors, or respectable land - holders ; and
     in the inferior order of both these, he is the per-
     sonal assistant, and works in conjunction with it.
     In the highest order, he has the reflected benefit
     of hereditary rank and wealth, circumstances of
    more importance than the superficial observer is
     aware of, but which are rendered sufficiently ap-
     parent by examining into the condition of the
     cottagers and labourers upon those estates which
       Nine-tenths of domestic female [servants][,] both in the [me-]
      tropolis and in all large towns, come from agricultural [districts][ .]
     So strong is the prejudice existing against town[-]bred[ servants] [,]
      that many families absolutely [refuse] to take [them][ under][ any]
      circumstances .
          It may be safely affirmed, that the virtue of female
      chastity does not exist amongst the lower orders of England,
      except to a certain extent among domestic female servants, who
     know that they hold their situations by that tenure, and are
     more prudent in consequence."-Report of Poor Laws' Com-
      mission.

     are benefited by the residence of their proprie-
     tors .
      These are a few of the moral advantages which
     he possesses still, to some extent, over the factory
     labourer. Of late years , indeed , the breaking-up

    the surrounding towns and villages ; their family
     interest thus, of course, merging in that of their
    employers . In all these cases a strict watch is
    kept over their morals . No point of similarity
     exists then between them , except in the single one
    of separation of families, and that too at a period
    and in a way to be as little injurious as possible
     to the moral character of the parties.
     The agricultural labourer has other moral ad-
     vantages over those possessed by the manufac-
     turing one. He is frequently under the direct
     inspection of his employer, in the middle class of
     land proprietors , or respectable land -holders ; and
     in the inferior order of both these, he is the per-
     sonal assistant, and works in conjunction with it
     In the highest order, he has the reflected benefit
     of hereditary rank and wealth, circumstances of
    more importance than the superficial observer is
     aware of, but which are rendered sufficiently ap-
     parent by examining into the condition of the
     cottagers and labourers upon those estates which
      * Nine-tenths of domestic female servants, both in the me-
      tropolis and in all large towns, come from agricultural districts.
     So strong is the prejudice existing against town-bred servants,
      that many families absolutely refuse to take them under any
      circumstances.
           66 It may be safely affirmed, that the virtue of female
      chastity does not exist amongst the lower orders of England,
      except to a certain extent among domestic female servants, who
     know that they hold their situations by that tenure , and are
     more prudent in consequence."-Report of Poor Laws' Com-
      mission.

     are benefited by the residence of their proprie-
     tors.
      These are a few ofthe moral advantages which
     he possesses still, to some extent, over the factory
     labourer. Of late years , indeed , the breaking-up
     of small farms- and other causes, have brought
     into operation upon him, the demoralizing agency
     of poverty and want of employ, and its influence
     has done much to deprive him of many of the be-
     nefits he once enjoyed .
      In addition to the enumeration already given of

     and the early age at which children are impressed

     THERE is nothing which so truly marks the
    character of a community, in a moral point of
    view, as domestic manners ; nothing which affords
    so correct and decided a criterion by which a
    judgment may be formed of its happiness and
    comfort. Politically speaking, the common people
    may be a dead letter, whilst their homes
    exhibit private independence and social enjoy-
    ment. Politically speaking, a people may possess
    many immunities -many rights-may even exer-
     cise a very marked control over the actions of their

      rulers , whilst their homes exhibit social disorgan-
      ization and moral worthlessness .
      The social confederacy of the present genera-
      tion is full of anomalies. Possessing, as the great
      bulk of the population does, many advantages
        ་ ་ never known or dreamt of by their forefathers ;
      education rapidly progressing ; its wants liberally
      relieved ; its sicknesses carefully tended ; religion
      afforded it, nay, even brought to its doors , and
      applied to its senses ; a practicability of earning
      something towards a livelihood ; continual ac-
      cessions of political privileges - it is nevertheless
      filled with immorality, irreligion, improvidence,
      political discontent, refusal to earn anything, in-
      gratitude, ignorance , and vice , in every con-
      ceivable form in which it can develop itself.
       Neither are these evils confined to one class
     of the labouring commmunity, proving very suffi-
      ciently that other causes must be at work beyond
      those dependent upon manufacture, on the one
     hand, and agriculture on the other. Neither is
      the excess of the existing demoralization less in

     the agricultural than in the commercial districts,
     though the one is a scattered population , and the
      other is gathered together in towns or crowded
      localities, circumstances in themselves unfavour-
      able to health and morals ; the former of which are
     consequently freed from many of those causes of
     declension which powerfully influence the latter.

   tive , is one singularly unfavourable to domesticity .
   Rising at or before day-break , between four and
    five o'clock the year round , scarcely refreshed by
   his night's repose, he swallows a hasty meal , or
   hurries to the mill without taking any food what-
   ever. At eight o'clock half an hour, and in some
   instances forty minutes , are allowed for breakfast .
   In many cases , the engine continues at work
   during mealtime , obliging the labourer to eat and
    still overlook his work. This , however , is not
   universal. This meal is brought to the mill , and
   generally consists of weak tea , of course nearly
   cold , with a little bread ; in other instances, of
   milk-and-meal porridge . Tea, however, may be
   called the universal breakfast , flavoured of late
   years too often with gin or other stimulants .
   Where the hands live in immediate proximity to
   the mill, they visit home ; but this rarely happens ,
   as they are collected from all parts, some far,
   some near ; but the majority too remote to leave
   the mill for that purpose . After this he is inces-
   santly engaged- not a single minute of rest or
   relaxation being allowed him.
    At twelve o'clock the engine stops , and an hour
   is given for dinner . The hands leave the mill ,
   and seek their homes, where this meal is usually
   taken . It consists of potatoes boiled ; very often
   eaten alone ; sometimes with a little bacon , and
   sometimes with a portion of animal food . This
    latter is , however , only found at the tables of the
   more provident and reputable workmen . If, as

```

```
       it often happens , the majority of the labourers
      reside at some distance , a great portion of the
       allotted time is necessarily taken up by the walk ,
      or rather run , backwards and forwards . No time
       is allowed for the observances of ceremony. The
      meal has been imperfectly cooked , by some one
       left for that purpose, not unusually a mere child ,
      or superannuated man or woman . The entire
      family surround the table, if they possess one ,
      each striving which can most rapidly devour the
      miserable fare before them, which is sufficient ,
      by its quantity , to satisfy the cravings of hunger,
      but possesses little nutritive quality. It is not
      half masticated ; is hastily swallowed in crude
      morsels , and thrust into the stomach in a state
      unfavourable to the progress of those subsequent
      changes which it ought to undergo. As soon as
       this is effected , the family is again scattered . No
       rest has been taken ; and even the exercise , such
      as it is , is useless , from its excess , and even
      harmful , being taken at a time when repose is
      necessary for the digestive operations .
       Again they are closely immured from one
      o'clock till eight or nine , with the exception of
      twenty minutes , this being allowed for tea, or
      baggin-time, as it is called . This imperfect meal
       is almost universally taken in the mill : it consists
      of tea and wheaten bread, with very few excep-
      tions . During the whole of this long period they
      are actively and unremittingly engaged in a
      crowded room and an elevated temperature , so

    that, when finally dismissed for the day, they are
    exhausted equally in body and mind .
      It must be remembered , that father, mother,
    son, and daughter, are alike engaged ; no one
    capable of working is spared to make home (to
    which, after a day of such toil and privation , they
    are hastening ) comfortable and desirable . No
    clean and tidy wife appears to welcome her hus-
    band - no smiling and affectionate mother to
    receive her children — no home , cheerful and in-
    viting, to make it regarded . On the contrary , all
    assemble there equally jaded ; it is miserably
    furnished- dirty and squalid in its appearance ..
    Another meal , sometimes of a better quality , is
    now taken, and they either seek that repose
    which is so much needed , or leave home in the
    pursuit of pleasure or amusements, which still
    farther tend to increase the evils under which
    they unavoidably labour .
     The staple diet of the manufacturing population
     is potatoes and wheaten bread , washed down by
    tea or coffee.* Milk is but little used . Meal is
    consumed to some extent, either baked into cakes
     * The increased consumption of tea and coffee[,][ as] [compared]
     to the increase in population [,] shows the change[ in][ the][ habits]
     which has been going on so rapidly during the [present][ century][.]
    The quantity of sugar consumed in 1814 [was][ 1,997,000lbs] [.][ ;]
     in 1832, 3,655,000 lbs . , an increase of 83 per cent[.][ ;][ increase][ in]
     population, 24 per cent [.] ; tea, in 1814 [,] 19,224,000 [lbs][.;] [1832][,]

      or boiled up with water, making a [porridge][ at]
      once nutritious , easy of digestion , and readily
      cooked . Animal food forms a very small part of
      their diet, and that which is eaten is often of an
      inferior quality. In the class of fine spinners and
      others , whose wages are very liberal [,] flesh meat [is]
      frequently added to their meals[.] Fish is bought
      to some extent, though by no [means] very[ largely][ ;]
      and even this not till it has undergone [slight] [de-]
      composition, having been first exposed in the mar-
      kets, and , being unsaleable , is then hawked about
      the back streets and alleys [,] where it is disposed of
      for a mere trifle . Herrings are eaten not un-
      usually ; and though giving a relish to their
      otherways tasteless food, are not very well
       fitted for their use. The process of salting,
      which hardens the animal fibre [,] renders [it] difficult
      of digestion, dissolving slowly [,] and their stomachs
      do not possess the most active or energetic [cha-]
      racter. Eggs , too, form some portion of the ope-
       ratives ' diet . The staple, however, is tea and
      bread . Little trouble is required in preparing
      them for use ; and this circumstance, joined to
      the want of proper domestic arrangements[,][ favours]
       their extensive use amongst a class so [improvident]
      and careless as the operative [manufacturers][ .]
       Tobacco is very largely consumed by the male
      and female labourers indiscriminately ; hundreds
      of men and women may be daily seen inhaling
      the fumes of this extraordinary plant, by means

    of short and blackened pipes . * Smoking, too , is
   an almost universal accompaniment to drinking-
   a pernicious habit, as will be shortly seen , pre-
    vailing to a frightful extent in this portion of the
   population .
    The difference exhibited both by the [buyers]
   and sellers of animal and vegetable food on the
   Saturday, which is the general provision [market-]
   day and the pay -day of the labourers[,] in the [morn-]
   ing and evening, very strikingly illustrates the[ dif-]
    ferent grades into which the community of a
    manufacturing town or district is divided [.]
     Speaking generally, the markets are well sup-
    plied , both as regards quality and quantity.
   Animal food , consisting of beef, mutton , veal, and
   pork , is plentiful , and of the best sorts - certainly
   not surpassed by any market in the kingdom .
   Vegetables are equally abundant and of an equally
   good quality . Lancashire has indeed long been
   famous for the excellence of its potatoes, a native
    rarely meeting with any fit to be compared
   with them for growth and flavour . Cheese , flour,
    butter, &c . &c . , are also in like manner good and
   abundant-in short, there is nothing eatable but
   what may be found at a moderate price and in any
    quantity.
     * The consumption of tobacco has increased from 1814 to
    1832 , from 15,000,000lbs. to 20,000,000 lbs, that is, about
    31 per cent. against an increase in population of 24 per cent.
    It is much less used now than formerly by the upper and
    middle classes.

       In the morning the markets are crowded with
      well-dressed respectable persons making their
     purchases for the ensuing week-order, civility,
     decency being preserved as far as these things
     can be on such occasions . The best animal
     food , whether it be flesh , fish , or fowl , is of course
       first carried away to the larders and cellars of the
     middle and upper classes, and the same with the
      vegetables . The day wears on , and about noon
     a change is observable in the appearance of the
     markets . The morning's trading had pretty well
      cleared them , a tolerably accurate balance being
      preserved between the supply of prime and first-
      rate articles, and the probable demand . At this
     time they are beginning to fill again--the butchers'
      stalls are replenished-the vegetables start into
     being the sides of the streets in the principal
     market thoroughfares become lined with baskets
      or petty stalls, the property of sellers of every
      variety of minor article likely to tempt the cupi-
      dity or taste of vulgarity .
       It might be supposed that a supply of similar
      quality to that of the morning was now to be found ,
     -but it is widely different. Coarse- badly fed-
      too long kept, and not unfrequently diseased animal
     food, stands in the room of the excellent article of
     the morning. The vegetables have undergone
     an equal deterioration , consisting of the refuse of
     the morning's supply. These are retailed out,
     not by the respectable dealer or grower, but
     by a congregation of small buyers who have

    selected their stocks , not from their excellence[ ,]
    but from their cheapness ; -and the same inferi-
    ority holds throughout. And what a scene is
    Saturday night's market- what a hubbub of [dis-]
    cordant sounds — what jangling [,] swearing[ ,] drunken-
    ness , noisy vociferation , confusion worse con-
    founded, riot and debauchery . Thus passes
    Saturday till near midnight- a scene of turmoil[,]
     strife , and roguery .
     If the perfection of social and domestic life
    consisted in limiting and stinting the supplies of
    man's natural wants , as to food - or if this perfec-
    tion consisted less in the limiting these supplies ,
    than in an indifference as to their quality, —a very
    great portion of the lowest classes in the great manu-
    facturing towns are rapidly approaching , or rather
    have already nearly approached perfection . If
    true wisdom , as to eating, consists in simply satisfy-
    ing the cravings of appetite , without reference to
    the nature or place of doing this-then do these
    people exhibit a high order of wisdom . There is,
    however, an intimate relation between moral
   and domestic virtues and modes of living . The
    Irish hand-loom weaver, who rarely tastes any
    food but potatoes , has reduced his scale of living
    to its utmost simplicity, and he holds the lowest
    rank in the very low classes even in these situa-
    tions. Recklessness and improvidence may be
    ever detected by coarse , inferior, and badly
    cooked diet. Poverty , even in its very extremity,
    if still retaining any trace of self-respect, any

      tincture of a wish or hope for better things, will
      have its meals, even though they may be hardly
     worthy the name, with a regard to common de-
      cency and decorum . The savage who feeds pro-
      miscuously upon whatever comes before him,
     from his own species to ants and caterpillars ,
      affords by this very omnivorousness, the most
      decisive proofs of his want of civilization, and
      domestic forethought and economy. So does the
     workman, in a different order of society, who con-
      sumes the refuse merely of those around him ,
      without regard to its quality, he proclaims, if
      possible, in still more decided language , the extent
      of his moral and social debasement.
      The mere supply of the wants of nature, with
      respect to food , absorbs but a very small amount
      of the wages earned by the majority of the manu-
      facturing labourers- confined as the supply is to
      the coarsest and most simple viands . Men máy
      be found who have not yielded to the indifference
      and destructive habits of the mass, who are living
      in comfort and decency upon the average amount
      of wages earned by the whole population- a suf-
       ficient proof, if proof were wanting , that the mis-
      chief lies full as much with the labourers them-
      selves, as in the system of labour ; -bad as that
       is acknowledged to be.
       The extinction of decent pride in their house-
      hold establishments , which at present character-
      izes the mass of the manufacturing population ,
      presents them in a very unfavourable point of view.

    There are none of the minor comforts of existence .
    nothing but a hut of squalor and filth , alike repul-
    sive to sight and smell and injurious to health-
    having few of the requisites of home, except as a
    place of mere shelter. It is stripped of every thing
    which might render it pleasant or delightful , and
    has in consequence no hold upon the affections .
   The labourer leaves it without regrethe antici-
    pates no joy on his return- he finds there no-
    thing but want and all these are in a great mea-
    sure the results , not ofthe pressure of actual want,
   but of his own bad and improvident habits .
    The pure and quiet joys of home, may indeed
    never have been known either to himself or his
    family ; but surely there is within the human
    heart even within their hearts, hardened and
   debased as they are some yearning after domes-
         -
    tie bliss some faint glimmer of a better and
    purer order of things some longing to shake off
   a condition of life, that, like an incubus, presses
   upon and destroys all the best energies of their
    nature .
    The operative having no home which can cheer
    the brief period allowed him from labour- des-
    titute of moral principle, unguided and uninflu-
    enced by good example- flies for relief to
    the gin -vault or the beer-house , dissipating in
    these haunts of crime and depravity, resources
   which, if properly applied , would furnish his house
    decently, supply his table with wholesome and
    nutritious food , and provide him with ample

     means to make him a respectable member of so-
      ciety .
      The plainness and want of solidity and proper
      stimulus in the food of the labourer, is attended
     by some other evils, bearing strongly upon his
      domestic habits .
       His labour is continued so uninterruptedly[ ,][ that]
      whether it is morning[,] or noon[ ,] or night [,][ he][ leaves]
      the mill or work-shop , and devours his watery [meal]
      with feelings of such mental depression [and][ bodily]
      exhaustion that he eagerly swallows a stimulus[ in]
      the shape of spirits or beer[,] to supply by[ its][ tem-]
      porary exciting influence the want of proper [food]
      on the one hand , and of due relaxation on [the][ other][.]
       This habit ofdram-drinking, so fatal in its conse-
      quences , is of the most extensive prevalence . By
      satisfying the cravings for support , and by rousing
      into activity the mental faculties , the labourers ,
      male as well as female , swallow the pernicious
      draught, and bless it as the boon which relieves them
      from their harassed sensations . They resemble in
      this respect the hypochondriac , who flies madly to a
      stimulant which in his better senses he deprecates
      and avoids as a curse ; but there is this lamentable
      difference- that the labourers have no lucid inter
      vals , no return of correct sensations . Day after
      day their toil is accumulated upon them. Deprived
      of the cheering influence of the face of Nature ,
      robbed of the pure breath of heaven, cooped up
      in crowded buildings , with the Babel -like sounds
      of their companions, animate and inanimate, their

    overstrained minds and bodies know no return to

    deeper into the whirlpool , till they neither know
    their danger , nor , if they did [,] could they avoid or
    escape it, without a moral discipline [,] a physical
    regeneration , which at present appear, if not
    utterly hopeless , at least very remote[ .]
    The increase which has of late years taken
    place in the number of gin-vaults , and the more
    than equal increase in the number of low beer-
    houses since the passing of the bill termed the
   Beer Bill , though its more correct designation

      or boiled up with water, making a porridge at
      once nutritious , easy of digestion, and readily
      cooked. Animal food forms a very small part of
      their diet, and that which is eaten is often of an
       inferior quality. In the class of fine spinners and
      others, whose wages are very liberal , flesh meat is
      frequently added to their meals. Fish is bought
      to some extent , though by no means very largely ;
      and even this not till it has undergone slight de-
      composition, having been first exposed in the mar-
      kets , and, being unsaleable , is then hawked about
      the back streets and alleys, where it is disposed of
      for a mere trifle . Herrings are eaten not un-
      usually ; and though giving a relish to their
      otherways tasteless food, are not very well
       fitted for their use . The process of salting,
      which hardens the animal fibre , renders it difficult
      of digestion, dissolving slowly, and their stomachs
      do not possess the most active or energetic cha-
      racter. Eggs , too, form some portion ofthe ope-
      ratives' diet. The staple, however, is tea and
      bread . Little trouble is required in preparing
      them for use ; and this circumstance, joined to
      the want of proper domestic arrangements , favours
      their extensive use amongst a class so improvident
      and careless as the operative manufacturers .
       Tobacco is very largely consumed by the male
      and female labourers indiscriminately ; hundreds
      of men and women may be daily seen inhaling
      the fumes of this extraordinary plant, by means

   of short and blackened pipes .* Smoking, too , is
   an almost universal accompaniment to drinking-
   a pernicious habit, as will be shortly seen, pre-
   vailing to a frightful extent in this portion of the
   population .
    The difference exhibited both by the buyers
   and sellers of animal and vegetable food on the
   Saturday, which is the general provision market-
   day and the pay - day of the labourers , in the morn-
   ing and evening, very strikingly illustrates the dif-
   ferent grades into which the community of a
   manufacturing town or district is divided .
    Speaking generally, the markets are well sup-
   plied , both as regards quality and quantity.
   Animal food, consisting of beef, mutton, veal , and
   pork, is plentiful , and of the best sorts- certainly
   not surpassed by any market in the kingdom .
   Vegetables are equally abundant and of an equally
   good quality. Lancashire has indeed long been
   famous for the excellence of its potatoes, a native
   rarely meeting with any fit to be compared
   with them for growth and flavour . Cheese , flour,
    butter, & c . & c . , are also in like manner good and
   abundant- in short, there is nothing eatable but
   what may be found at a moderate price and in any
    quantity .
     * The consumption of tobacco has increased from 1814 to
    1832 , from 15,000,000lbs. to 20,000,000 lbs , that is, about
    31 per cent. against an increase in population of 24 per cent.
    It is much less used now than formerly by the upper and
    middle classes.

      In the morning the markets are crowded with
     well-dressed respectable persons making their
     purchases for the ensuing week-order, civility,
     decency being preserved as far as these things
     can be on such occasions . The best animal
     food , whether it be flesh , fish, or fowl , is of course
      first carried away to the larders and cellars of the
     middle and upper classes , and the same with the
      vegetables . The day wears on , and about noon
     a change is observable in the appearance of the
     markets. The morning's trading had pretty well
      cleared them, a tolerably accurate balance being
     preserved between the supply of prime and first-
      rate articles, and the probable demand . At this
     time they are beginning to fill again--the butchers '
      stalls are replenished-the vegetables start into
     being the sides of the streets in the principal
     market thoroughfares become lined with baskets
      or petty stalls , the property of sellers of every
      variety of minor article likely to tempt the cupi-
      dity or taste of vulgarity.
       It might be supposed that a supply of similar
      quality to that of the morning was now to be found ,
     -but it is widely different . Coarse- badly fed-
     too long kept , and not unfrequently diseased animal
     food, stands in the room of the excellent article of
     the morning . The vegetables have undergone
     an equal deterioration , consisting of the refuse of
     the morning's supply. These are retailed out,
     not by the respectable dealer or grower, but
    by a congregation of small buyers who have

    selected their stocks, not from their excellence[ ,]
    but from their cheapness [;] —and the same inferi-
    ority holds throughout[.] And what a scene is
    Saturday night's market- what a hubbub [of][ dis-]
    cordant sounds- what jangling [,] swearing [,] [drunken-]
    ness, noisy vociferation , confusion worse con-
    founded, riot and debauchery . Thus passes
    Saturday till near midnight- a scene of turmoil[ ,]
     strife, and roguery .
     If the perfection of social and domestic life
    consisted in limiting and stinting the supplies of
    man's natural wants , as to food - or if this perfec-
    tion consisted less in the limiting these supplies ,
    than in an indifference as to their quality, -a very
    great portion of the lowest classes in the great manu-
    facturing towns are rapidly approaching, or rather
    have already nearly approached perfection . If
    true wisdom , as to eating , consists in simply satisfy-
    ing the cravings of appetite , without reference to
    the nature or place of doing this- then do these
    people exhibit a high order of wisdom. There is ,
    however, an intimate relation between moral
    and domestic virtues and modes of living . The
    Irish hand-loom weaver, who rarely tastes any
    food but potatoes, has reduced his scale of living
    to its utmost simplicity, and he holds the lowest
    rank in the very low classes even in these situa-
    tions . Recklessness and improvidence may be
    ever detected by coarse , inferior, and badly
    cooked diet. Poverty, even in its very extremity,
    if still retaining any trace of self-respect, any

      tincture of a wish or hope for better things , will
      have its meals , even though they may be hardly
      worthy the name, with a regard to common de-
      cency and decorum . The savage who feeds pro-
      miscuously upon whatever comes before him ,
      from his own species to ants and caterpillars ,
       affords by this very omnivorousness , the most
      decisive proofs of his want of civilization , and
      domestic forethought and economy. So does the
      workman, in a different order of society, who con-
      sumes the refuse merely of those around him,
      without regard to its quality, he proclaims, if
      possible, in still more decided language, the extent
      of his moral and social debasement.
       The mere supply of the wants of nature, with
      respect to food , absorbs but a very small amount
        • of the wages earned by the majority of the manu-
            -
      facturing labourers confined as the supply is to
      the coarsest and most simple viands . Men may
      be found who have not yielded to the indifference
      and destructive habits of the mass, who are living
       in comfort and decency upon the average amount
      of wages earned by the whole population- a suf-
       ficient proof, if proof were wanting, that the mis-
       chief lies full as much with the labourers them-
       selves, as in the system of labour ; -bad as that
       is acknowledged to be.
       The extinction of decent pride in their house-
      hold establishments , which at present character-
       izes the mass of the manufacturing population,
       presents them in a very unfavourable point of view.

    There are none of the minor comforts of existence-
    nothing but a hut of squalor and filth , alike repul-
     sive to sight and smell and injurious to health-
    having few of the requisites of home, except as a
    place of mere shelter. It is stripped of every thing
    which might render it pleasant or delightful , and
    has in consequence no hold upon the affections .
    The labourer leaves it without regrethe antici-
    pates no joy on his return- he finds there no-
    thing but want-and all these are in a great mea-
    sure the results , not ofthe pressure of actual want,
    but of his own bad and improvident habits .
     The pure and quiet joys of home, may indeed
    never have been known either to himself or his
    family ; but surely there is within the human
    heart even within their hearts, hardened and
    debased as they are some yearning after domes-
     tie bliss-some faint glimmer of a better and
    purer order of things - some longing to shake off
    a condition of life, that, like an incubus, presses
    upon and destroys all the best energies of their
    nature .
     The operative having no home which can cheer
    the brief period allowed him from labour-des-
     titute of moral principle, unguided and uninflu-
    enced by good example- flies for relief to
    the gin -vault or the beer-house, dissipating
    these haunts of crime and depravity, resources
    which, if properly applied , would furnish his house
    decently, supply his table with wholesome and
    nutritious food , and provide him with ample

     means to make him a respectable member of so-
      ciety .
      The plainness and want of solidity and proper
      stimulus in the food of the labourer, is attended
     by some other evils, bearing strongly upon his
      domestic habits .
       His labour is continued so uninterruptedly[,][ that]
      whether it is morning, or noon [,] or night[,] he [leaves]
      the mill or work- shop , and devours his watery [meal]
      with feelings of such mental depression and [bodily]
      exhaustion that he eagerly swallows a stimulus [in]
      the shape of spirits or beer[,] to supply by[ its][ tem-]
      porary exciting influence the want of proper [food]
      on the one hand , and of due relaxation on [the][ other][.]
       This habit ofdram- drinking , so fatal in its conse-
      quences , is of the most extensive prevalence . By
      satisfying the cravings for support , and by rousing
      into activity the mental faculties , the labourers ,
      male as well as female , swallow the pernicious
      draught, and bless it as the boon which relieves them
      from their harassed sensations . They resemble in
       this respect the hypochondriac , who flies madly to a
      stimulant which in his better senses he deprecates
      and avoids as a curse ; but there is this lamentable
      difference- that the labourers have no lucid inter
      vals , no return of correct sensations . Day after
      day their toil is accumulated upon them . Deprived
      of the cheering influence of the face of Nature ,
      robbed of the pure breath of heaven, cooped up
      in crowded buildings, with the Babel -like sounds

    overstrained minds and bodies know no return to
    healthy feelings , and they plunge deeper and
    deeper into the whirlpool, till they neither know
    their danger, nor, if they did , could they avoid or
    escape it, without a moral discipline, a physical
    regeneration, which at present appear, if not
    utterly hopeless , at least very remote.
    The increase which has of late years taken
    place in the number of gin-vaults , and the more
   than equal increase in the number of low beer-
   houses since the passing of the bill termed the
   Beer Bill, though its more correct designation
   would have been a " bill for the demoralization
   of the working classes "-is sufficiently indicative
   of the prevalence of dram-drinking and tavern-

       is allowed for the observances of ceremony. The
      meal has been imperfectly cooked , by some one
       left for that purpose , not unusually a mere child ,
      or superannuated man or woman . The entire
      family surround the table, if they possess one,
      each striving which can most rapidly devour the
      miserable fare before them , which is sufficient,
      by its quantity, to satisfy the cravings of hunger,
      but possesses little nutritive quality. It is not
      half masticated ; is hastily swallowed in crude
      morsels , and thrust into the stomach in a state
      unfavourable to the progress of those subsequent
      changes which it ought to undergo. As soon as
       this is effected, the family is again scattered . No
       rest has been taken ; and even the exercise , such
       as it is , is useless , from its excess , and even
      harmful, being taken at a time when repose is
      necessary for the digestive operations .
       Again they are closely immured from one
      o'clock till eight or nine , with the exception of
      twenty minutes, this being allowed for tea, or
      baggin-time, as it is called . This imperfect meal
       is almost universally taken in the mill : it consists
      of tea and wheaten bread , with very few excep-
      tions . During the whole of this long period they
      are actively and unremittingly engaged in a
      crowded room and an elevated temperature , so

    that, when finally dismissed for the day, they are
    exhausted equally in body and mind .
     It must be remembered , that father , mother,
    son, and daughter, are alike engaged ; no one
    capable of working is spared to make home (to
    which , after a day of such toil and privation , they
    are hastening) comfortable and desirable . No
    clean and tidy wife appears to welcome her hus-
    band - no smiling and affectionate mother to
    receive her children - no home , cheerful and in-
    viting, to make it regarded . On the contrary, all
    assemble there equally jaded ; it is miserably
    furnished-dirty and squalid in its appearance .
    Another meal , sometimes of a better quality , is
    now taken, and they either seek that repose
    which is so much needed , or leave home in the
    pursuit of pleasure or amusements, which still
    farther tend to increase the evils under which
    they unavoidably labour.
     The staple diet of the manufacturing population
     is potatoes and wheaten bread , washed down by
    tea or coffee. * Milk is but little used . Meal is
    consumed to some extent, either baked into cakes
     * The increased consumption of tea and [coffee][,][ as][ compared]
     to the increase in population [,] shows the change[ in][ the][ habits]
    which has been going on so rapidly during the [present][ century][.]
    The quantity of sugar consumed in 1814 [was][ 1,997,000lbs][.][ ;]
     in 1832, 3,655,000 lbs [.] , an increase of 83 [per][ cent][.;][ increase][ in]

      or boiled up with water, making a [porridge][ at]
      once nutritious , easy of digestion , and readily
      cooked. Animal food forms a very small part of
      their diet, and that which is eaten is often of [an]
       inferior quality. In the class of fine spinners and
      others , whose wages are very liberal [,] flesh meat [is]
      frequently added to their meals [.] Fish is bought
      to some extent, though by no means very[ largely][ ;]
      and even this not till it has undergone [slight] [de-]
      composition, having been first exposed in the mar-
      kets, and , being unsaleable , is then hawked about
      the back streets and alleys , where it is [disposed][ of]
       for a mere trifle . Herrings are eaten not un-
      usually ; and though giving a relish to their
      otherways tasteless food , are notnot very well
       fitted for their use. The process of salting,
      which hardens the animal fibre , renders it difficult
      of digestion , dissolving slowly, and their stomachs
      do not possess the most active or energetic [cha-]
       racter. Eggs , too , form some portion of the ope-
       ratives' diet. The staple, however, is tea and
      bread . Little trouble is required in preparing
      them for use ; and this circumstance, joined to
      the want of proper domestic arrangements , favours
       their extensive use amongst a class so [improvident]
      and careless as the operative manufacturers [.]
       Tobacco is very largely consumed by the male

    of short and blackened pipes.* Smoking, too , is
    an almost universal accompaniment to drinking-
    a pernicious habit, as will be shortly seen, pre-
     vailing to a frightful extent in this portion of the
    population .
     The difference exhibited both by the buyers
    and sellers of animal and vegetable food on the
    Saturday, which is the general provision market-
    day and the pay- day ofthe labourers , in the morn-
    ing and evening, very strikingly illustrates the dif-
    ferent grades into which the community of a
    manufacturing town or district is divided.
     Speaking generally, the markets are well sup-
     plied , both as regards quality and quantity.
    Animal food , consisting of beef, mutton, veal , and
    pork , is plentiful , and of the best sorts- certainly
    not surpassed by any market in the kingdom .
    Vegetables are equally abundant and of an equally
    good quality. Lancashire has indeed long been
    famous for the excellence of its potatoes, a native
     rarely meeting with any fit to be compared
    with them for growth and flavour. Cheese , flour,
     butter, &c . & c . , are also in like manner good and
    abundant- in short, there is nothing eatable but
    what may be found at a moderate price and in any
    quantity .
      * The consumption of tobacco has increased from 1814 to
     1832 , from 15,000,000lbs. to 20,000,000 lbs, that is, about
     31 per cent. against an increase in population of 24 per cent.
     It is much less used now than formerly by the upper and
     middle classes.

      The plainness and want of solidity and proper
      stimulus in the food of the labourer , is attended
     by some other evils, bearing strongly upon his
      domestic habits .
       His labour is continued so uninterruptedly[ ,][ that]
     whether it is morning, or noon , or night[,] he leaves
      the mill or work- shop , and devours his watery meal
      with feelings of such mental depression and bodily
      exhaustion that he eagerly swallows a stimulus [in]
      the shape of spirits or beer[,] to supply by[ its] [tem-]

     on the one hand , and of due relaxation on the [other][.]
       This habit ofdram- drinking, so fatal in its conse-
      quences, is of the most extensive prevalence . By
      satisfying the cravings for support, and by rousing
      into activity the mental faculties , the labourers ,
     male as well as female, swallow the pernicious
      draught , and bless it as the boon which relieves them
      from their harassed sensations . They resemble in
      this respect the hypochondriac , who flies madly to a
      stimulant which in his better senses he deprecates
     and avoids as a curse ; but there is this lamentable
      difference- that the labourers have no lucid inter
      vals, no return of correct sensations . Day after

      of the cheering influence of the face of Nature ,

     The increase which has of late years taken
    place in the number of gin-vaults , and the more
    than equal increase in the number of low beer-

    entering a gin shop, in five minutes, during eight successive

     till ten . The average result was 112 men and 163 women,

       It is a strange sight to watch one of these dens
     of wickedness throughout an evening : it is a
     strange, a melancholy, yet, to the meditative man ,
     an interesting sight . There approaches a half-
     clad man, covered with cardings , shivering even
     beneath the summer breeze which is singing
     around him. He comes with faltering step ,
     downcast eye, and air of general exhaustion and
     dejection, He reaches his accustomed gin-vault,
     disappears for half an hour or less , and now
     comes forth a new creature : were it not for his
     filthy dress, he would hardly be recognized- for
     his step is elastic, his eye is brilliant and open,
     his air animated and joyous . He inhales the
     breeze as a refreshing draught, and he deems him-
     self happy . His enjoyment is, however, short-

      lived , and purchased at an immense sacrifice , for
     the
              " -Price is death !
                 It is a costly feast."
     Now comes a woman, perhaps his wife, bear-
     ing a sickly and cadaverous-looking infant, wail-
     ing and moaning as if in pain or wanting nutri-
     ment. She is indeed offering it the breast, but
      it is flaccid and cold as marble . She has no
     endearments for her child , it is held as a burden-
     passively and carelessly . She is thin, pale, and
     badly dressed- is without oonnet, and her cap is
      soiled and ragged ; her bosom is exposed, her
     gown is filthy, her shoes only half on her feet,
     and her whole aspect forlorn and forbidding.
     She too disappears for a time within the gin-shop,
     remains longer than her husband, but returns
     equally changed . The child is now crowing in
     her arms , clapping its tiny hands , and is filled
     with infantine mirth , whilst its mother views it
     with fondness , joins in its vociferations , tosses it
     in her arms and kisses it like a mother . She
     passes on cheerily, her whole gait is altered , her
     cheeks are flushed , and she thinks herself happy-
     for her maternal feelings are aroused , and her
     inebriated child seems to her own disordered
     senses the very paragon of beauty and delight.
      The pair have now reached home- night is far
     advanced , and the fumes of their intoxications are
     worn off or become converted into sullenness .
     The child is in a stupor, and the husband and

    leaving the child lying on a ricketty chair[,] from

     Here come several girls and young women ,
    tolerably dressed ; some with harsh, husky voices,
    shewing the premature development of puberty,
    others full grown and perfectly-formed women.
    All , save one, have the same pallid hue of counte-
    nance, the same coarseness of expression , the
    same contour of figure-but all seem equally toil-
    worn and exhausted . One amongst them is ,
    however, beautiful , and beautiful as an innocent
     girl alone can be--the very purity of her heart
    and her soul gleaming in her face. Her figure is
    plump and round , and her cheeks, though some-
    what pale, are yet firm in their outline . It is
    evident that she is scarcely at home in the pre-
    sence of her companions , nor one of them in
    feeling, though it would seem that she is
    condemned to the same labour . Yes ! it is so .
    She is not many weeks returned from a distant
    town, in which she had been apprenticed to a
    respectable trade . Adverse circumstances have ,
    however, driven her home, and she has no re-
    source but to become a weaver, and this she has
    been for upwards of a week . She hesitates to
    enter the beer shop--she withdraws timidly, but

      long ; and now approach a number of young men
      with soiled dress , open necks , and of obscene
      speech. They, too, enter the beer house, Laugh-
      ter long and loud resounds from it ; time wears
      on , but the drunken revel continues unabated→
     now shewing itself by bursts of obstreperous
      merriment- now by vollies of imprecations- now
     by the rude dance and now by the ribald song.
     But where is that delicate and beautiful girl ? Can
      she be one sharing such scenes ? Can she, whose
      eyes and ears evidently revolted from the bold
      gestures and speeches of her companions , be re-
      maining to share such coarse orgies ? Eleven
      o'clock, and the party re-appear. Cursing , swear.
      ing, hiccuping, indecent displays , mark their exit ;
      and there is the fair girl , whose " unsmirched brow"
      so lately gave token of her purity. But now she
       is metamorphosed into a bacchanal, with distend-
      ed and glowing cheeks, staggering step , disordered
      apparel- lost, utterly lost, to herself ; and when
      the morning bell rings her to her appointed la-
      bour, she will be one of the herd, and will
      speedily lose all trace of her purity and feminine
      beauty.

    apparel, or equally wretched furniture .

      upon them, be it twopence, fourpence , sixpence ,
      eightpence, or one shilling.
       This utter disregard for personal comfort and
      household decency, strongly demonstrates the
      miserably low ebb to which the domestic relations
      are reduced , and proclaims , in a voice which it
       is impossible to misunderstand , how deplorable ,
     how pitiable is the condition , which thus deprives
      itself, like the untutored and uncultivated savage,
      of every thing humanising, for the sake of a mo-
     mentary excitement ; -which leaves matters in an
      infinitely worse state than before , and precipitates
      the unhappy being who thus blindly indulges a
     depraved taste, only the more rapidly upon his
      inevitable ruin . * Truly did Mr. Hunter remark ,
      that of all the products of civilization , the North
    " American savage was anxious alone for brandy
      * Neither has this passion lessened since the day of the acute
      Hunter. At the treaty of Chicago , in 1821 , the commissioners
      ordered that no spirits should be issued to the Indians . A de-
      putation of the chiefs was sent to remonstrate against this pre-
      cautionary measure ; and at its head was Topnibe, chief of the
      Potawatomic tribe, a man upwards of eighty years of age.
      Every argument was used to convince them that the measure
      was indispensable : that they were exposed to daily murders,
      and that while in a state of intoxication, they were unable to
      attend to the business for which they were convened . All this
      was useless, and discussion only terminated by the peremptory
      refusal ofthe commissioners to accede to their request. " Father,"
      said the hoary-headed chief, when he was urged to remain
      sober, and make a good bargain for his people, " Father, we
      care not for money, nor the lands, nor the goods.- We want
      the whiskey. Give us the whiskey."

   and gunpowder ; and with equal truth it may be
    said, that the nearer a people approach to the
    destitution of savage life , the more eagerly do
   they seek to participate the enjoyments of
    intoxication . Distilled spirits afford a cheap and
    effectual oblivion of cares and wants , and how-
   ever much the indulgence may increase the sum of
   human sufferings , it is not surprising that they
   who have no other pleasure within their reach,
   should madly snatch at this solitary comfort.
     Independently of these open and recognised
   means , which are within the the reach of the la-
   bourer and his family, there are others of most ex
    tensive operation for demoralizing him , through
   the agency of drunkenness and its attendant vices .
   The lowest class of the population , in the manu-
    facturing towns , is , to a very considerable extent,
   made up of Irish, who inhabit the cellars and
   those portions of the towns which , to the casual
    observer, would appear totally uninhabitable . In
    these places , however, is congregated a very nu-
   merous body of people, who have introduced
    with them the same spirit of recklessness and im-
    providence , with the same systematic evasion of or
    violent resistance to law and order , which have so
    long disgraced their native country , and gone far
    towards ruining its resources . Here , and by these
    individuals , illicit distillation is carried on to a
    great extent. It has been calculated , upon not
    very perfect data , that there are not less than 100

       stills in constant operation in Manchester alone, *
      producing genuine potheen ofthe highest strength.
      From many seizures which have been made, it
      appears that the average size of the tubs may be
      about thirty gallons, and if each distillery should
      produce no greater quantity than this , the whole
      amount would be very considerable ; and this is
      drunk, be it remembered , almost exclusively by
      the lowest classes . Reckoning thirty gallons as
      the weekly produce, it would give annually
      156,000 gallons , which pays no duty, and the ma-
      nufacture of which is carried on under circum-
      stances in the highest degree unfavourable to the
      welfare of a peaceable population . This estimate
       is, however, most probably underrated-the dif-
       ficulty of detection is extreme-occupying, as the
       distilleries do, sites apparentlythe most improbable,
      and unfitted for the purpose . These generally are
      dark cellars, having no outlet except a trap-door,
      opening into some obscure court, half filled with
       filth , or excavations dug in the sand -stone rock,
      beneath tenements occupied by persons either
      knowing nothing of their subterranean neighbours ,
      or being in league with them. The requisite ap-
      paratus is so simple and so little expensive , that
       * During the year 1832 , thirty persons were committed to
      the New Bailey, Manchester, for having either been detected
       in distilling or hawking illicit spirits. Nearly the whole of
       these were Irish-one half had been known to have carried on
       the trade before, and one-third had been previously convicted
      and suffered imprisonment.

   detection is no hinderance , and a seizure valueless .
   The fine inflicted , £30, is of no moment to the
   successful speculator ; and if it should so happen
   that he is unable to pay it, the short imprisonment
   which is the alternative , only hardens him in
   crime, and turns him out upon society a more
   determined and experienced scoundrel .
    The introduction of a low Irish population into
   Manchester and the surrounding manufacturing
   towns and districts, has unquestionably aided very
   materially the destruction of domestic virtues and
   orderly habits in the operatives . The disregard
   to home comforts, which renders the Irish cabin a
   blot upon the history of its country, is exhibited
    still more strikingly when seen in the midst of a
   large town ; and it has, unfortunately , found ready
    imitators in a class of the community, prepared
    for its adoption, in some degree, by poverty, ig-
   norance, want of morality, and a growing indis-
    position for home, generated by a system of labour
   which, by separating families , and by exhausting
    their physical energies by incessant application ,
   rendered them ready to fly, for temporary relief,
   to the gin-shop, the beer-house or the whiskey
    dealer.

      upon them , be it twopence , fourpence, sixpence ,
      eightpence , or one shilling.
        This utter disregard for personal comfort and
      household decency, strongly demonstrates the
      miserably low ebb to which the domestic relations
      are reduced , and proclaims, in a voice which it
       is impossible to misunderstand , how deplorable ,
      how pitiable is the condition , which thus deprives
       itself, like the untutored and uncultivated savage ,
      of every thing humanising, for the sake of a mo-
                 ――
      mentary excitement ; which leaves matters in an
       infinitely worse state than before , and precipitates
      the unhappy being who thus blindly indulges a
      depraved taste, only the more rapidly upon his
      inevitable ruin . * Truly did Mr. Hunter remark,
      that of all the products of civilization , the North
      " American savage was anxious alone for brandy
       * Neither has this passion lessened since the day of the acute
      Hunter. At the treaty of Chicago, in 1821 , the commissioners
       ordered that no spirits should be issued to the Indians . A de-
       putation of the chiefs was sent to remonstrate against this pre-
       cautionary measure ; and at its head was Topnibe , chief of the
      Potawatomic tribe, a man upwards of eighty years of age.
      Every argument was used to convince them that the measure
      was indispensable : that they were exposed to daily murders,
      and that while in a state of intoxication , they were unable to
       attend to the business for which they were convened . All this
      was useless , and discussion only terminated by the peremptory
       refusal ofthe commissioners to accede to their request. " Father,"
       said the hoary-headed chief, when he was urged to remain
       sober, and make a good bargain for his people, " Father, we
       care not for money, nor the lands, nor the goods.- We want
      the whiskey. Give us the whiskey."

   and gunpowder ; and with equal truth it may be
    said , that the nearer a people approach to the
    destitution of savage life , the more eagerly do
   they seek to participate the enjoyments of
    intoxication . Distilled spirits afford a cheap and
    effectual oblivion of cares and wants, and how-
   ever much the indulgence may increase the sum of
   human sufferings , it is not surprising that they
   who have no other pleasure within their reach ,
    should madly snatch at this solitary comfort.
     Independently of these open and recognised
   means, which are within the the reach of the la-
   bourer and his family, there are others of most ex
    tensive operation for demoralizing him , through
   the agency of drunkenness and its attendant vices .
   The lowest class of the population , in the manu-
    facturing towns , is , to a very considerable extent ,
   made up of Irish , who inhabit the cellars and
   those portions of the towns which, to the casual
    observer, would appear totally uninhabitable . In
    these places , however, is congregated a very nu-
   merous body of people, who have introduced
    with them the same spirit of recklessness and im-
    providence , with the same systematic evasion of or
    violent resistance to law and order , which have so
    long disgraced their native country, and gone far
    towards ruining its resources . Here , and by these
    individuals , illicit distillation is carried on to a
    great extent. It has been calculated , upon not
    very perfect data , that there are not less than 100

       stills in constant operation in Manchester alone, *
      producing genuine potheen of the highest strength .
     From many seizures which have been made, it
      appears that the average size of the tubs may be
      about thirty gallons , and if each distillery should
      produce no greater quantity than this , the whole
      amount would be very considerable ; and this is
      drunk, be it remembered , almost exclusively by
      the lowest classes . Reckoning thirty gallons as
      the weekly produce, it would give annually
      156,000 gallons , which pays no duty, and the ma-
      nufacture of which is carried on under circum-
      stances in the highest degree unfavourable to the
      welfare of a peaceable population . This estimate
       is, however, most probably underrated- the dif
       ficulty of detection is extreme-occupying, as the
       distilleries do , sites apparentlythe most improbable ,
      and unfitted for the purpose . These generally are
      dark cellars, having no outlet except a trap-door,
      opening into some obscure court, half filled with
       filth , or excavations dug in the sand -stone rock ,
      beneath tenements occupied by persons either
      knowing nothing of their subterranean neighbours ,
      or being in league with them. The requisite ap-
      paratus is so simple and so little expensive , that
       * During the year 1832, thirty persons were committed to
       the New Bailey, Manchester, for having either been detected
       in distilling or hawking illicit spirits. Nearly the whole of
       these were Irish-one half had been known to have carried on
       the trade before, and one-third had been previously convicted
      and suffered imprisonment.

    detection is no hinderance , and a seizure valueless .
    The fine inflicted , £30 , is of no moment to the
    successful speculator ; and if it should so happen
    that he is unable to pay it , the short imprisonment
    which is the alternative, only hardens him in
    crime , and turns him out upon society a more
    determined and experienced scoundrel .
     The introduction of a low Irish population into .
    Manchester and the surrounding manufacturing
    towns and districts, has unquestionably aided very
    materially the destruction of domestic virtues and
    orderly habits in the operatives . The disregard
    to home comforts , which renders the Irish cabin a
    blot upon the history of its country , is exhibited
     still more strikingly when seen in the midst of a
    large town ; and it has , unfortunately , found ready
     imitators in a class of the community, prepared
     for its adoption, in some degree, by poverty, ig-
    norance, want of morality, and a growing indis-
     position for home, generated by a system of labour
    which, by separating families, and by exhausting
     their physical energies by incessant application,
    rendered them ready to fly, for temporary relief,
    to the gin-shop, the beer-house or the whiskey
    dealer.

   would amend , or their endeavours will do no
   good, but may, from want of proper direction , do
    infinite harm .
    The inquirer into the progress of the civiliza-
    tion of man , has long ago learnt the following
    series of facts . He finds that as man removes
   from utter barbarism-from a state elevated but
   one remove above the brute creation--he raises
   himself a habitation , more or less comfortable , as
   a shelter against the vicissitudes of the seasons ,
   and as a place of refuge ; that in his primeval
   condition he contented himself with the shelter
   of a tree, and the protection of the natural caves
   or strong-holds around him ; that, at this period ,
   he lives upon aliment chiefly of a vegetable na-
   ture, or picks up a scanty and precarious subsist-
   ence by fishing , or devouring the minuter forms
   of animal life ; that in his first advance in social
   improvement , he erects himself a rude hut of
   wood, or sods, or stone, as his particular locality
   may point out to him , badly built , badly covered -in,
   admitting little light , but freely open to the winds
   of heaven ; that he now becomes a hunter, and
    tills imperfectly a small patch of ground , for the
   production of those esculent roots or seeds which
   experience has taught him are fit for the support
   of life ; that in his next advance he improves his
   hut, forms a communion with his fellows under
   an acknowledged superior , joins his labours ,
   whether of the chace or of cultivation , with those
   of others - shews some tokens of religion , how-

      lived , and purchased at an immense sacrifice , for
      the
              " -Price is death !
                 It is a costly feast."
      Now comes a woman, perhaps his wife, bear-
      ing a sickly and cadaverous-looking infant , wail-
     ing and moaning as if in pain or wanting nutri-
     ment. She is indeed offering it the breast, but
       it is flaccid and cold as marble . She has no
     endearments for her child , it is held as a burden-
      passively and carelessly . She is thin, pale, and
     badly dressed- is without oonnet , and her cap is
      soiled and ragged ; her bosom is exposed , her
     gown is filthy, her shoes only half on her feet,
     and her whole aspect forlorn and forbidding.
     She too disappears for a time within the gin-shop,
     remains longer than her husband , but returns
      equally changed . The child is now crowing in
     her arms, clapping its tiny hands, and is filled
      with infantine mirth , whilst its mother views it
      with fondness, joins in its vociferations, tosses it
      in her arms and kisses it like a mother . She
      passes on cheerily, her whole gait is altered , her
      cheeks are flushed , and she thinks herself happy-
      for her maternal feelings are aroused , and her
      inebriated child seems to her own disordered
      senses the very paragon of beauty and delight.
      The pair have now reached home- night is far
     advanced , and the fumes of their intoxications are
     worn off or become converted into sullenness .
     The child is in a stupor, and the husband and

     wife meet without a single kindly greeting . There
     is no food , no fire : bickerings arise, mutual re-
     crimination, blows, curses -till both at last sink
     into the stupified sleep of drunkenness , worn out
    by toil, excessive stimulus , and evil passions--
     leaving the child lying on a ricketty chair, from
    which it must inevitably fall should it awake.
     Here come several girls and young women,
     tolerably dressed ; some with harsh, husky voices,
    shewing the premature development of puberty,
     others full grown and perfectly- formed women .
     All , save one, have the same pallid hue of counte-
    nance, the same coarseness of expression , the
    same contour of figure-but all seem equally toil-
    worn and exhausted . One amongst them is ,
    however, beautiful, and beautiful as an innocent
     girl alone can be--the very purity of her heart
    and her soul gleaming in her face . Her figure is
    plump and round, and her cheeks , though some-
    what pale, are yet firm in their outline. It is
    evident that she is scarcely at home in the pre-
    sence of her companions , nor one of them in
     feeling , thoughthough it would seem that she is
    condemned to the same labour . Yes ! it is so .
    She is not many weeks returned from a distant
    town, in which she had been apprenticed to a
    respectable trade. Adverse circumstances have,
    however, driven her home , and she has no re-
    source but to become a weaver , and this she has
    been for upwards of a week. She hesitates to
     enter the beer shop--she withdraws timidly, but

      at length is lost within its door , amidst the laugh-
       ter and jeers of her companions. They remain
      long ; and now approach a number of young men
      with soiled dress , open necks , and of obscene
      speech. They, too , enter the beer house, Laugh-
      ter long and loud resounds from it ; time wears
      on , but the drunken revel continues unabated-
     now shewing itself by bursts of obstreperous
      merriment- now by vollies of imprecations- now
     by the rude dance and now by the ribald song.
      But where is that delicate and beautiful girl ? Can
      she be one sharing such scenes ? Can she, whose
      eyes and ears evidently revolted from the bold
      gestures and speeches of her companions , be re-
      maining to share such coarse orgies ? Eleven
      o'clock, and the party re-appear. Cursing , swear-
      ing, hiccuping, indecent displays , mark their exit ;
      and there is the fair girl, whose " unsmirched brow"
      so lately gave token of her purity. But now she
      is metamorphosed into a bacchanal, with distend-
      ed and glowing cheeks , staggering step, disordered
      apparel- lost, utterly lost, to herself ; and when
      the morning bell rings her to her appointed la-
      bour , she will be one of the herd, and will
      speedily lose all trace of her purity and feminine
      beauty.
       If there is one period of the day when these
      displays excite more unmingled disgust than ano-
      ther, it is during the hours of labour, when those
      wives and mothers of the absent artizans , who
      are either unable to work, or cannot procure it,

    are left at home. No domestic cares occupy

        This utter disregard for personal comfort and
       household decency, strongly demonstrates the
       miserably low ebb to which the domestic relations
       are reduced, and proclaims , in a voice which it

      the trade before, and one-third had been previously convicted
      and suffered imprisonment.

    detection is no hinderance , and a seizure valueless .
    The fine inflicted , £30 , is of no moment to the
    successful speculator ; and if it should so happen
    that he is unable to pay it, the short imprisonment
    which is the alternative , only hardens him in
    crime, and turns him out upon society a more
    determined and experienced scoundrel .

    lived, and purchased at an immense sacrifice , for
    the
             " -Price is death !
                It is a costly feast."
    Now comes a woman, perhaps his wife, bear-
    ing a sickly and cadaverous-looking infant, wail-
    ing and moaning as if in pain or wanting nutri-
    ment . She is indeed offering it the breast, but
     it is flaccid and cold as marble . She has no
    endearments for her child , it is held as a burden-
    passively and carelessly . She is thin, pale, and
    badly dressed- is without oonnet , and her cap is
     soiled and ragged ; her bosom is exposed , her
    gown is filthy, her shoes only half on her剿 feet,
    and her whole aspect forlorn and forbidding .
    She too disappears for a time within the gin-shop ,
    remains longer than her husband , but returns
    equally changed . The child is now crowing in
    her arms , clapping its tiny hands , and is filled
    with infantine mirth, -whilst its mother views it
    with fondness, joins in its vociferations , tosses it
    in her arms and kisses it like a mother. She
    passes on cheerily, her whole gait is altered , her
    cheeks are flushed , and she thinks herself happy-
     for her maternal feelings are aroused , and her
     inebriated child seems to her own disordered
     senses the very paragon of beauty and delight.
     The pair have now reached home- night is far
    advanced , and the fumes of their intoxications are
    worn off or become converted into sullenness .
    The child is in a stupor, and the husband and

    wife meet without a single kindly greeting . There
     is no food, no fire : bickerings arise , mutual re-
    crimination , blows, curses -till both at last sink
    into the stupified sleep of drunkenness , worn out
    by toil, excessive stimulus , and evil passions--
    leaving the child lying on a ricketty chair, from
    which it must inevitably fall should it awake .
     Here come several girls and young women ,
    tolerably dressed ; some with harsh, husky voices ,
    shewing the premature development of puberty,
    others full grown and perfectly-formed women .
     All , save one , have the same pallid hue of counte-
    nance, the same coarseness of expression , the
    same contour of figure-but all seem equally toil-
    worn and exhausted . One amongst them is,
    however, beautiful, and beautiful as an innocent
     girl alone can be--the very purity of her heart
    and her soul gleaming in her face. Her figure is
    plump and round , and her cheeks , though some-
    what pale, are yet firm in their outline . It is
    evident that she is scarcely at home in the pre-
    sence of her companions, nor one of them in
    feeling, though it would seem that she is
    condemned to the same labour. Yes ! it is so.
    She is not many weeks returned from a distant
    town, in which she had been apprenticed to a
    respectable trade. Adverse circumstances have ,
    however, driven her home, and she has no re-
    source but to become a weaver, and this she has
    been for upwards of a week . She hesitates to
    enter the beer shop --she withdraws timidly, but

      at length is lost within its door, amidst the laugh-
      ter and jeers of her companions. They remain
      long ; and now approach a number of young men
      with soiled dress , open necks , and of obscene
      speech. They, too , enter the beer house, Laugh-
      ter long and loud resounds from it ; time wears
      on , but the drunken revel continues unabated-
     now shewing itself by bursts of obstreperous
      merriment- now by vollies of imprecations-now
     by the rude dance--and now by the ribald song.
     But where is that delicate and beautiful girl ? Can
      she be one sharing such scenes ? Can she, whose
      eyes and ears evidently revolted from the bold
      gestures and speeches of her companions, be re-
      maining to share such coarse orgies ? Eleven
      o'clock, and the party re-appear. Cursing, swear-
      ing, hiccuping, indecent displays , mark their exit ;
      and there is the fair girl , whose " unsmirched brow"
      so lately gave token of her purity . But now she
      is metamorphosed into a bacchanal, with distend-
      ed and glowing cheeks, staggering step , disordered
      apparel- lost, utterly lost, to herself ; and when
      the morning bell rings her to her appointed la-
     bour, she will be one of the herd, and will
      speedily lose all trace of her purity and feminine
      beauty.
       If there is one period of the day when these
      displays excite more unmingled disgust than ano-
      ther, it is during the hours of labour, when those
      wives and mothers of the absent artizans , who
      are either unable to work, or cannot procure it,

     are left at home. No domestic cares occupy
    them, except in a few rare cases . Their hearths
     are unswept, their persons and houses uncleaned ,
     their rooms untidied . On the contrary, they
     are seen in groups of two or three, lounging about
    the gin or beer shops, wasting any trifle of money
    they may have reserved , or procuring a supply
    by pawning some portion of their wretched ap-
     apparel, or equally wretched furniture .
      Pawnbrokers ' shops have an affinity in their
     demoralizing agency to the gin and beer houses ,
    and are almost as numerous , occupying the same
     localities , and giving unhappy facilities to the
    poor man to protract his Saturday night's, or
     Sunday's debauch throughout the early part
     of the week . Article after article is pledged
     for small sums , to be redeemed the next pay-
    day, and homesteads which, on the Saturday
    mornings, are destitute of every domestic utensil ,
     are found, in the evening, possessing some ofthese .
    They have been fetched from pledge , a loss has
    been sustained upon them, and in ninety - nine
     cases out of one hundred they are again missing
     before the middle of the ensuing week. The same
    with regard to dress-coat or trowsers , cloak,
     dress , or under dress , shoes , stockings , &c . & c . ,
     all have a constant round . Sacrifice after sacrifice
     takes place, till at length the articles are either left
    unredeemed , or are become so far worn and tattered
     as to be no longer a valid security to the pawn-
     broker, even for the very small sum he advances

     upon them, be it twopence , fourpence, sixpence,
      eightpence , or one shilling.
       This utter disregard for personal comfort and
      household decency, strongly demonstrates the
      miserably low ebb to which the domestic relations
      are reduced, and proclaims , in a voice which it
      is impossible to misunderstand , how deplorable ,
     how pitiable is the condition , which thus deprives
      itself, like the untutored and uncultivated savage ,
     of every thing humanising, for the sake of a mo-
     mentary excitement ; -which leaves matters in an
      infinitely worse state than before , and precipitates
     the unhappy being who thus blindly indulges a
     depraved taste, only the more rapidly upon his
      inevitable ruin . * Truly did Mr. Hunter remark,
     that of all the products of civilization , the North
     American savage was anxious alone for brandy
      * Neither has this passion lessened since the day of the acute
      Hunter. At the treaty of Chicago, in 1821 , the commissioners
      ordered that no spirits should be issued to the Indians . A de-
      putation of the chiefs was sent to remonstrate against this pre-
      cautionary measure ; and at its head was Topnibe, chief of the
      Potawatomic tribe, a man upwards of eighty years of age.
     Every argument was used to convince them that the measure
     was indispensable : that they were exposed to daily murders,
     and that while in a state of intoxication, they were unable to
      attend to the business for which they were convened. All this
     was useless, and discussion only terminated by the peremptory
      refusal of the commissioners to accede to their request . " Father,"
      said the hoary-headed chief, when he was urged to remain
      sober, and make a good bargain for his people, " Father, we
      care not for money , nor the lands, nor the goods.- We want
     the whiskey. Give us the whiskey."

   and gunpowder ; and with equal truth it may be
    said, that the nearer a people approach to the
    destitution of savage life , the more eagerly do
   they seek to participate the enjoyments of
    intoxication. Distilled spirits afford a cheap and
    effectual oblivion of cares and wants , and how-
    ever much the indulgence may increase the sum of
   human sufferings , it is not surprising that they
   who have no other pleasure within their reach ,
    should madly snatch at this solitary comfort.
     Independently of these open and recognised
   means, which are within the the reach of the la-
   bourer and his family, there are others of most ex
    tensive operation for demoralizing him, through
   the agency of drunkenness and its attendant vices .
   The lowest class of the population , in the manu-
    facturing towns , is , to a very considerable extent ,
   made up of Irish , who inhabit the cellars and
   those portions of the towns which , to the casual
   observer, would appear totally uninhabitable . In
    these places, however, is congregated a very nu-
   merous body of people, who have introduced
   with them the same spirit of recklessness and im-
    providence , with the same systematic evasion of or
    violent resistance to law and order , which have so
   long disgraced their native country, and gone far
   towards ruining its resources . Here , and by these
    individuals , illicit distillation is carried on to a
    great extent. It has been calculated , upon not
    very perfect data , that there are not less than 100

      stills in constant operation in Manchester alone , *
     producing genuine potheen ofthe highest strength .
     From many seizures which have been made, it
     appears that the average size of the tubs may be
     about thirty gallons , and if each distillery should
     produce no greater quantity than this , the whole
     amount would be very considerable ; and this is
     drunk, be it remembered , almost exclusivel
