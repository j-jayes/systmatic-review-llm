```
             of the early 2000s dot-com bust,
   the people of San José, California, face a changing
   landscape of lost dreams and careers gone awry. It’s
    in this setting that Katherine Watson, a forty-seven-
   year-old event planner and mother of two, moves
   back into her childhood home with her teenage son,
    Carter. They live with her aging father, who is under-
   going palliative care for prostate cancer. Katherine's
   husband, Scott, has gone missing after his risky
   investments failed and they were forced to sell their
   dream home.
      In this multigenerational family story, Katherine,
   Carter, and Scott all try to navigate an evolving world
    in the Golden State that doesn’t seem quite so golden
   any longer. Scott returns and hopes to restore and
   recreate their past happiness, Katherine contem-
   plates divorce and explores new love along the way,
   and Carter works to find a place for himself in a new
   school among classmates who are hostile to him.
     The characters fervently chase their dreams
   across Silicon Valley and beyond, from the gleam-
   ing office parks of Cupertino to a self-help seminar
   on the Las Vegas Strip and an underfunded high
   school theater production of The Tempest. The one
   element tying them all together is the house of
   the title, a 1950s tract home that once represented
   happiness and now holds the family close in its
   protective embrace, until, in the end, even this
   constant changes.

    /
   SHE REMEMBERED THIS: the time she stepped onto the roof
    of her childhood home in San José, the time she felt the tilting
    shingles under her feet as her father held her tiny hand in one of
    his and kept his other hand broad and strong at the small of her
    back. Katherine was five, and her brothers, eight and ten, had
   been throwing a Frisbee across the back lawn while she sat on the
   cement slab patio and toed the soft grass with her sneakers. “You’re
    too young to play,” they’d said. She watched with some resentment
    the disc spinning back and forth in the lowering sunlight as they
    all waited to be called in to dinner.
      It was the end of August, 1961, and the air in California was still
    and full, broken only by the distant chirr of power lawnmowers.
    In a week, her brothers would [begin ] [school ] [again, ] [and ] [she ] [would ]
    be left behind. Katherine missed [her ] [brothers ] [when ] [they ][were ] [off. ]
   Even if they treated her [like ] [a ] [pest ] [and ] [left ] [her ] [out ] [of ][games, ] [she ]
    still liked to study what [they ][were ] [doing, ] [plan ][what ] [she ] [would ] [do ]
    one day when she was their age.
     The backyard was narrow and completely fenced in by six-foot
    lengths of cedar running along the property lines, separating it from
    similar backyards on either side and behind it. As the boys grew bored,
    they began to throw the Frisbee in elaborate curves out over the fence
    and back into the yard. They called to Katherine to watch, then spun
    it up at a steep angle so that it descended right back into their hands.
   They tried for diving catches, leaping catches, they sprang straight up
    and grabbed the Frisbee between their legs. Katherine felt a little hap-
    pier they were at least including her as an audience.
     Then her oldest brother tried to curve the Frisbee over the roof,
    and it caught on the low peak and skidded against the wooden
    shingles and came to a rest three feet from the gutter. The two boys
    looked at each other.

```

-----

```
     Katherine’s oldest brother looked at her, as though considering
    the possibility of including her in the blame somehow. He looked
    up at the roof, hoping for a sudden gust of wind. Then he trudged
    into the house through the sliding glass patio doors.
      After a minute, Katherine heard the side door to the garage
    open and saw her father appear through the gate, carrying a
    wooden ladder over his shoulder like a heroic fireman. The tips
    of the ladder were swaddled in cloth fixed with tape, and he laid
    the ladder gently against the eaves above the stucco siding. Then
    he scaled it nimbly, bent forward as he stepped from the lad-
    der, and stood up against the sky, high as a tower. He was taller
    than anyone Katherine had ever seen, and now, on the roof, he
    looked colossal.
     He walked easily over to the Frisbee, tossed it down, then
    shaded his eyes with a flat hand.
     “Hey,” he said. “You can see a blimp from here.”
     There was something special about seeing a blimp in the early
    sixties. Only a few blimps were in existence, all owned by Good-
    year Tires, and unlike airplanes that appeared only as vapor trails,
     a blimp flew low and lazy and dreamlike. It took up a piece of sky,
    like a planet you could visit in the future. And it usually had a mes-
    sage, in electric lights across the side. When they saw a blimp, they
    would all gaze as it floated toward them, and Katherine would wait
    impatiently for the moment when her father would clear his throat
    and state, “Here’s what it says . . .”
      “Is it coming this way?” the older brother asked.
      “It’s going toward the bay.”
     “Can we climb up?” the younger brother asked.
     Her father hesitated. “Keep one hand on the ladder at all times,”
    he said. “And let me help you over the edge.”
     Katherine’s older brother scrambled up and within seconds was
    standing next to her father. Her middle brother climbed to the
    top of the ladder, then waited until her father grasped his hand
    strongly before he stepped out.

```

-----

```
     “Daddy,” Katherine said.
     “You’re too small to come up,” her older brother said.
     Her father looked down at her. She stood next to the ladder,
    twisting on one foot, hoping to be taken up. She could see her
    brothers, watching the blimp, and she looked in the same direc-
    tion, but she could see nothing but empty sky.
     Then her father was climbing down. “Promise me you'll be
    careful,” he said. “I don’t ever want to see you hurt.”
      “JT promise,” she said. It was an easy promise to make. She didn’t
    really believe she could be hurt with her father near her.
     He picked her up and placed her on the fourth rung, then
    climbed up behind her so that his body sheltered her. He helped
    her to the next rung, then climbed up one himself. Rung by rung,
    she rose up. Her older brother’s head loomed over the edge of the
    roof. He seemed an obstacle [at ] [first, ] [but ] [then ] [he ] [held ] [his ] [right ]
    hand out to her. Her middle [brother ] [was ] [sitting ] [on ] [the ] [roof ] [as ] [an ]
    anchor, holding her older [brother’s ] [left ] [hand ] [in ][his. ] [The ] [sky ][grew ]
    larger as she reached [the ] [top ] [of ][the ] [ladder. ] [She ] [took ] [her ] [brother ]
    by one hand, while her [father ] [held ] [her ] [other ] [hand, ] [and ][with ] [a ] [step ]
    she was on the roof. The [wooden ] [shingles ] [crunched ] [and ] [felt ] [oddly ]
    fragile, even under [her ] [soft-soled ] [Keds. ]
     Her father stood beside her, and she felt utterly safe as they
    all watched the blimp meander to the north. Katherine could see
    some lighted lettering on the side, even though it was far away.
    The lights were flashing on and off and would show up better in
    the twilight and early evening.
     “Here’s what it says... ,” her father said.
     They all looked at him.
      “It says, ‘The Watson family is ready for dinner. 333)
     Her two brothers objected. Katherine smiled and looked about.
    The view from high up was new and different. Stretching to the
    north, to the west, to the east, there lay a plain of roofs, all low-
    peaked shingled roofs like her own. The roofs extended as far as
    she could see, humping up and down, an uneven shingle prairie,

```

```
    a tree broke the line of weathered cedar wood in the still-recent
    housing tract, and the Coast Range rose to the west. But it was
    mostly roofs, a landscape of roofs, with a slow blimp floating free
    above them. Had the person who drew these streets on a map
    imagined this strange landscape?
     She heard the patio door slide open and her mother call that
    dinner was ready. Then the voice stopped.
     “Where is everybody?” her mother asked. “Are you there?”
    Now, in the late afternoon, Katherine parked her ten-year-old
    Saturn in the driveway of the same house. She stood, forty-seven
    years old, fifteen pounds heavier than when she was twenty, high-
    lights in her blondish hair, dressed in colors of rust and green with
    long earrings of silver and onyx dangling in the late sun of Sep-
    tember, 2003. She took from the car two plastic sacks of grocer-
    ies and walked to the front porch, concrete with a peeling wooden
    park bench filled with odd potted plants sheltered by a low over-
    hang. From the eaves, there hung a redwood sign her father had
   custom-made in Felton that read Peaceable Isle.
    When she walked in, she still felt that odd sensation of being
    a teenager again, walking into her old living room. But also the
    sensation of being her mother. Her mother had always disliked
    the way the front door opened right onto the living room, with no
    entry foyer that would allow her to put down her bags, hang up
    her coat, and not track right over the carpet to get to the kitchen.
    Katherine found herself displeased in the same way. She walked in
    with groceries now, not schoolbooks, and just like her mother, she
    felt oppressed by having to decide what to make for dinner.
     Katherine had moved into her father’s house ten months ear-
    lier, in debt, with a missing husband, with Betty, her disdainful
    daughter of seventeen, and with Carter, fifteen, becoming secre-
    tive and withdrawn. An events planner by profession, in charge
    of organizing the annual user’s conference for BPI, a software

   and therefore eternally wise and silent, always keeping to herself
   some bit of guidance that would have kept Katherine from error.
   Her father, a Pearl Harbor veteran, still living in the house that
   he had bought with a Veterans Administration loan after the war,
   now eighty and beating back lesions every three weeks with
   chemotherapy.
    When she moved back in with their father, her two older broth-
    ers were delighted. One brother was working in story develop-
   ment in Los Angeles. The other was a college professor in Ohio.
   They had moved on, they were successes, blight had not touched
    their well-fashioned lives. The national mourning of 2001 they
   wore lightly, and neither had a child in the army, or nearing eigh-
    teen years of age. They had moved on, and they looked back at
    the house on Catesby Street [as ] [old ] [and ] [squat ] [and ] [not ] [the ] [kind ] [of ]
    place they would ever live [again. ] [And ] [she ] [wondered ] [if ][her ] [broth- ]
    ers didn’t think sometimes [that ] [it ][had ] [all ] [fallen ] [into ] [place ] [rather ]
    nicely: her runaway husband, [her ] [need ] [for ] [a ] [place ] [to ] [live, ] [their ]
    father’s need for a caregiver, [the ] [tract ] [home ] [that ] [was ] [all ] [paid ] [off ]
   with low property taxes. [She ][was ] [the ] [daughter, ] [and ] [she ][was ] [conve- ]
    nient. And her brothers [were ] [off ][the ] [hook ][with ][a ][clear ] [conscience. ]
    Now she heard her father, Henry, rumble from the sunken den.
   “By God, who is that in the house?” He was up and walking toward
    her before she could put down the groceries, wearing one of his
    bright Hawaiian shirts covered with flowers. He liked wearing
   Hawaiian shirts, and shirts open at the throat with a silk scarf, and
    a beret to hide his hair loss. He took her in his arms and hugged
    her roughly, as he often did. Then he turned her loose and looked
    at her.
     “Youre losing too much weight,” Henry said. “You’re wasting
    away. Soon there won’t be anything left of you.”
     “Ha,” Katherine said. “I feel like a water buffalo.” She had been
    trying to stay a size 8 for years, sometimes coaxing her weight
   down so that she could fit her clothes and sometimes finding her
   weight floating up so that half her wardrobe was too tight. When

    she was forced into the rack of 10s, she found herself buying
    plainer stuff, beiges and creams and blacks. Her closet looked like
     a struggle between her aspirations for how she should look and
    her frequent admissions of defeat.
     “You have a secret admirer,” Henry said. “Water buffalo or no.”
     He pointed at a gift-wrapped box on the dining room table.
    Katherine crossed to the table, picked the box up, shook it. Some-
    thing shifted inside, heavy and muffled.
     “Not a bomb, is it?”
     “Hope not.”
     “This was on the front porch?”
     Henry shook his head. “It was right there.”
      It took Katherine a moment to process what her father had said.
     “He broke into the house?”
     Henry shrugged, nodded. Katherine sat down heavily. She
    picked up the envelope, the paper thick and textured, and flipped
    it to look at both sides. Her name was on the front. She slid a fin-
    ger in and ripped it open. The card slipped out, a romantic card
    with hearts and flowers and the Eiffel Tower on the front. Inside, it
    read, “I’ll be seeing you in all those old familiar places,” and it was
    signed, “Love, Scott.” There was no phone number, no address.
     Inside the box was a small, expensive, cut-glass bottle of
    perfume.
     “So he’s back,” she said. “And this is what he thinks is a good
    way to get back in touch. Break into the house and leave gifts.”
     Henry sat down opposite his daughter, at the same table where
    he had once sat with his wife to talk over what to do. The table
    had a cloth spread over it because it was old and the finish worn
    through. It was a solid maple table, the first part of a maple dining
    room set he and his wife began but never completed. He had never
    wanted to replace the table. He once thought about refinishing it,
    but never quite managed to do it.
     “What do you think we should do?” he asked.
      “T don’t know,” Katherine said.

    Scott Cochran, Katherine’s husband, had run through their money,
   including retirement accounts, investing in Internet startup com-
   panies. It was that time in Silicon Valley. Every day, there were
    stories about twenty-four-year-olds who had made millions over-
   night. The largest legal creation of wealth in history! Scott read and
   reread these stories and convinced himself that those kids didn’t
   deserve all that money, certainly not any more than he did. He
   began to feel old at forty-eight, as though he had been born twenty
   years too soon, as though the golden opportunity had somehow
   skipped his generation.
     He found his first investment through some cassette tapes he lis-
   tened to while doing the Stairmaster at the gym. It was an Internet
    store that would grow through word of mouth. Each store owner
   would have a portal that would offer name-brand products at rock-
   bottom prices that could be drop-shipped from a secure location.
   Name-Brand. Rock-Bottom. Drop-Shipped. [Secure. ] [But ] [the ] [real ]
   genius was that each store owner [could ] [sign ][up ][additional ] [store ] [own- ]
    ers. If you had a friend or neighbor [who ] [needed ] [a ][Sony ][television, ] [you ]
   could ask them to buy it through [your ] [store ] [at ][a ][better ][price ][than ] [they ]
   could get at Target. You [then ] [asked ] [them ] [if ][they ][would ] [be ][interested ]
    in owning their own [store. ] [As ] [they ][began ] [to ] [sell ] [things, ] [some ] [small ]
   percentage of their profits [would ] [come ] [to ][you. ] [And ] [as ] [they ][signed ][up ]
    store owners, you would [get ][a ][percentage ] [of ][their ] [percentage. ] [If ][you ]
   were in on the ground [floor, ] [the ] [profits ] [would ] [soon ] [be ][tremendous. ]
    With each store you bought, you also received a number of
    shares in the company. Pre-10 shares. Scott listened to that on the
   tape as well. Pre-Initial Public Offering. And when the 1po came
   through, and each of your shares was suddenly worth thousands,
   you would read about yourself in the newspaper.
     Scott listened to the tape as he worked out, taking one of the
   machines in the big front windows and wearing classic black Ray
   Ban Wayfarers so that he would look good from the parking lot.

```

```
    he couldn’t buy more shares in the company without buying more
     portals. Katherine never paid much attention to the financial state-
    ments and didn’t notice when the balances began to go down. She
    trusted him for that.
     They had moved to a new house in a development called Oak
    Commons in 1999, where Carter and Betty, their son and daugh-
     ter, could go to better schools. Betty was beginning high school
     that year, so it seemed like the right time. The house had a two-
     story front foyer that opened onto a great room with a fireplace and
    vaulted ceilings. The master bath, on the ground floor, had a Jacuzzi
     tub with a garden view, and the bedroom had a walk-in closet large
    enough to sleep in. They were able to sell their first house for three
     times what they’d paid for it, and they had a down payment and
    money to spare. Scott told Katherine they were being smart, could
     afford it, and deserved it. And she trusted him for that as well.
     While waiting for his stores to make good, Scott began to make
    other investments. There were always tips in chat rooms, and he
    decided that buying a lot of different recommended stocks was a
    way to be safe. If even one hit it big, it would make up for dozens
    of losers.
     Then, early in 2002, he was laid off. He had an engineering
    degree from Chico State, but for many years he had worked on
     the marketing side of a company that created software to teach
    people how to use computer programs. The company had been
    acquiring other firms that sold training software, expanding into
    online educational products, and reporting record profits. But
    when clients began to reject the standard three-year license deals
    and competitors cut prices, it turned out the record profits were an
     illusion. Sales orders had been booked on products still in devel-
    opment, defective products were returned and the returns never
    recorded, phony invoices were created by sending orders between
    fax machines in the same office. The company announced that reve-
    nues were down one-third from the previous quarter, and mar-
    keting personnel were the first to go.

   accounts, but Scott had decided that the penalties could be easily
   paid for with the profits he would be making. He asked for one
   extension for filling out their income tax, and then another. He
   spent time at an outplacement firm, posting résumés to Monster,
   Career Builder, Hot Jobs, and also checking his investments. At the
   end of each three-month extension, the actual value of the stock he
   had bought was less.
     Scott tried to avoid telling Katherine until he at least had found
   another job, but a job offer never materialized. His engineering
    skills were considered out-of-date and his marketing skills tainted.
   When he finally told her, he said one option was to sell the house.
    It turned out there were no other options except bankruptcy. They
   had refinanced once to pay off credit cards and a car loan with
   home equity, and there wouldn’t be much from the house after
   the bills were settled. And Katherine refused to go into bankruptcy
   with a man who was so ready to hide the truth from her because
   he was convinced he knew better.
     Scott disappeared soon after the house closed, before Kather-
   ine could move forward with a divorce. The studio apartment he’d
   rented in Cupertino, one small [box ] [among ] [many ] [others ] [overlook- ]
   ing a small landscaped commons, [was ] [empty ] [after ] [a ][month. ] [He’d ]
    left the house on Catesby [Street ] [as ] [a ] [forwarding ] [address, ] [and ] [for ]
   months overdue bills for [electricity ] [and ] [gas ] [came, ] [red ] [lettering ]
   on the envelope stating [“2nd ] [Notice” ] [or ] [“Final ] [Notice.” ] [Katherine ]
   wrote Not at this address [on ] [the ] [envelopes ] [and ] [left ][them ] [outside ] [for ]
   the letter carrier. Sometimes [she ][wrote ] [He’s ] [not ] [here ] [and ][I ][don’t ][give ]
    a damn where he [is. ] [Other ] [times, ] [she ] [wrote ] [If ][you ] [see ] [him, ] [say ] [hello, ]
   he might be in Tangiers. [She ][was ] [certain ] [he ][would ] [turn ] [up ] [sooner ] [or ]
    later.
   Scott had gone back to a barely remembered time of his life, a phase
   that was over before he even met Katherine. In 1974 he’d enlisted
   in the navy just in time to aid with the evacuation of Saigon, and

     been aboard a fleet oiler in the Indian Ocean in 1979, when the
     Iranian hostage crisis struck, and had spent months servicing air-
     craft carrier battle groups. Some part of him was disappointed
     that no action was taken, that he hadn’t come back with stories
     to tell.
      The attacks on New York and Washington coincided with his
     investments dwindling toward zero. After he lost his job, he began
     to follow the military buildup in the Indian Ocean and the Ara-
     bian Sea, the same waters he’d sailed in twenty-three years earlier.
    He visualized the aircraft carrier battle groups converging on the
     region and wondered if the same great names were there that had
     been there in 1979: the Kittyhawk, the Nimitz, the Enterprise. And
     he visualized the fleet oilers, like the ship he’d sailed on, standing
     off over the horizon, ready to rendezvous at dusk to fill a carri-
     er’s vast tanks with jet fuel, while fighter jets swarmed overhead to
     provide cover.
      The war in Afghanistan resolved itself quickly, according to
     reports. But the war in Iraq, foretold by newspapers and maga-
     zines and network news, was just ahead when he had to admit to
     Katherine how much money he had lost, how much they owed,
    what a mess he’d made of things. He was broke and living in a
    one-bedroom apartment. He was unemployed. He saw the age of
     fifty looming, a narrow doorway to a narrower corridor. He was
      still seeking a life of consequence. And he found a website for the
     Military Sealift Command (msc). With battle groups in the Indian
    Ocean indefinitely, he knew there would be a need for experienced
    seamen.
    Katherine received the first letter from Scott soon after the war
     began. Then they came weekly. Scott’s letters described the long
     hours of work, the nights when they stayed at the refueling rigs
     until dawn with an aircraft carrier to port and a destroyer to star-
     board. They described the empty sea between refuelings, the kinds

   coat. They described the sunsets over the Indian Ocean, and how
   bright the stars were at night, and the sound of the ship’s wake as
   it spread out from the stern.
    Katherine wrote him back and told him that he should under
   no circumstances consider himself welcome to stay at her father’s
   house. It wasn’t his home. She wrote that she hoped he would
   stay safe and settle somewhere nearby when he came back, so that
   he could stay involved with the children. Money was also a prob-
   lem, since her father had to keep most of his funds for his own
   medical expenses, and she’d like to be able to help with college
   for the kids.
     His letters back didn’t acknowledge her letters at all. He told of
   watching a helicopter hover over the ship’s flight deck, forward of
   the bridge, and lower canvas bags of mail and pick up bags of out-
   going mail. And he told of his hope, as he watched, that the mail
   contained a letter from her. He didn’t mention that she’d written
   him that he wouldn’t be welcome. It was infuriating.
    Then, in August, the letters stopped. A week went by with-
   out a letter, and then another [week. ] [Carter ] [was ] [getting ] [ready ]
    to begin high school, seeming a [little ] [adrift ] [since ] [they’d ] [had ] [to ]
   move. Betty had graduated [and ] [moved ] [to ] [Aptos, ] [living ] [with ] [her ]
   boyfriend in a house owned [by ][his ] [parents, ] [waiting ] [tables ] [at ] [a ]
   small Szechwan restaurant [on ] [West ] [Cliff ] [Drive. ] [Henry ] [had ] [his ]
   chemotherapy sessions. [Katherine ] [didn’t ] [notice ] [that ] [weeks ] [had ]
   gone by without a [letter ] [until ] [the ] [month ] [turned ] [and ] [she ] [stopped ]
    to wonder if he was [well. ] [The ] [news ] [coverage ] [of ][the ] [war ] [rarely ]
   showed ships, but [she ] [thought ] [she ] [would ] [have ] [heard ] [if ][a ] [sup- ]
   port ship had sunk. [She ] [watched ] [cnn ] [several ] [nights ] [in ][a ][row, ] [but ]
   the news from [the ] [Middle ] [East ] [was ] [contradictory ] [and ] [confusing ]
   and didn’t tell [her ] [anything ] [about ] [the ] [man ] [she ] [was ] [still ] [techni- ]
   cally married to.
    After a few days, she forgot to wonder about him. A phone call
   would come, sooner or later, and he would be over his big adven-
   ture, and they would settle some things.

     lar group in the Garden Spot Café at the Blue Skies Bowl, a bowl-
     ing alley surrounded on one side by subdivisions and tract homes
    and on the other side by the Western Horizons Shopping Mall. The
     Blue Skies Bowl was built in the early sixties, the name chosen to
    appeal both to those “Blue Sky” families moving to San José to
     be part of the aerospace industry and to those older residents who
    remembered the Irving Berlin song from the Bing Crosby movie.
     After four decades, the bowling alley was slated for demolition, to
     be replaced by townhouses and condominiums, and the regulars
     at the café had not yet decided where they would gather once it
    was gone.
      In the café, Henry had a reuben or a hot pastrami sandwich, bad
     for his heart, he knew, but since his prostate was going to kill him
     first, it didn’t matter much. The group he met there were all of an age
     more or less, some city workers, some in real estate, one who had
    managed the produce section at a Safeway. They were veterans—all
    had served overseas during World War II. They weren’t the sort
    who joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars or the American Legion,
     but they held that time in common, and though they didn’t discuss
     it among themselves, a number of them gave talks about the war
    through a Veterans in the Schools program.
      Henry’s prostate cancer wasn’t the first in the group and prob-
     ably wouldn’t be the last. A man who liked a dirty joke, Al Dayton,
     told them all that it was the pissing that first let him know he had
     a problem, the pissing and the backaches that weren’t just the rou-
     tine. And when he was ready to go in for the radical surgery, he
    looked down and sang “Thanks for the memories,” like Bob Hope.
     Henry found the gift box of perfume one afternoon when he came
    back from the Garden Spot. He knew it wouldn’t have been hard for
     Scott to see that nobody was home. He kept his Buick LeSabre in the
    driveway, since the garage was filled with things he’d never thrown
    away, and he drove the few blocks to the bowling alley. When he
    was younger, he had enjoyed the walk, but the chemotherapy left

                                to café.
   one could see that the driveway was empty during the day, anybody
   could see when the house was vacant.
   Katherine had thought about support groups when Scott left, but
   she decided against it. There were probably support groups for
   women whose husbands had blown all their money on Internet
    stocks. She was sure of it. But there wouldn’t be support groups for
   women whose husbands had run off to sea at the age of forty-eight.
   Pretending they were twenty-five again. That’s not normal. Run-
   ning away to sea. The whole thing seemed archaic.
    When two days passed since the perfume was left, and Scott
    didn’t try to contact her like a normal human being, she decided to
    try to catch him in the house. Perhaps they could talk to each other
    like adults. Her father insisted that she take him with her, and so
    she left work at noon and met him at the Garden Spot. She liked
    seeing her father sitting at the [same ] [round ] [table ] [in ] [a ] [vinyl-lined ]
   booth in the corner. He always [seemed ] [perfectly ] [content ] [there, ]
   happy that his little haven [hadn’t ] [yet ][changed, ] [happy ] [to ] [meet ] [old ]
    friends, even if the talk was [no ] [longer ] [about ] [problems ] [with ] [busi- ]
    ness or the kids and now [centered ] [on ] [doctors ] [and ][medical ] [bills ] [and ]
   retirement accounts.
    Henry stood up when Katherine came in. “See?” he said. “I told
   you an attractive young woman was picking me up today.”
     The other men laughed and asked Katherine to sit down, join
   them, have a cup of coffee, but she told them next time, when she
   wasn’t so busy.
    They left together in his Buick. Henry still liked to be the one
    driving. When they went in for his chemo treatments, he drove
    to the oncology unit and they took his car, even though they both
   knew that she would be driving back after he’d had the shunt in
    his chest hooked up for three hours.
    They saw an old green Plymouth Fury in front of the house.

    She flipped down the sun visor and looked at her hair in the mir-
     ror and grimaced.
     When she moved back into the house, she had to adjust to open-
    ing the front door. During the years of living on her own, and then
    with Scott, she had evolved from just walking in as though she
     still lived there, to giving a quick knock and then walking in, to
    ringing the doorbell and waiting for her father to let her in. After
    moving back, it took her some time to be able to simply open the
    door. At first she felt some reluctance about it—she didn’t want to
    admit that, yes, she had moved back home at the age of forty-seven
    and those other houses and apartments she’d lived in were only
    temporary. But after months of unloading groceries or walking in
    with two briefcases and bracing the screen door open with her hip
    while she fumbled with her keys, her resistance vanished with the
    press of the everyday.
     Now, absurdly, she knocked three times before turning the key,
     as though Scott had some rights over the house she was entering.
    She patted her hair once more and opened the door.
    Scott had been at sea longer than he’d expected. Baghdad fell
     in May, and he thought that the aircraft carriers and their battle
    groups would soon head for their home ports, and his own ship
    would make the long voyage back to Subic Bay, in the p1, and
    he could get paid off and back home. But after May, the carrier
    groups stayed in the region, circling around, and he heard they
    were still flying sorties day and night. And his ship stayed in the
    area too, having its own massive tanks refilled by a commercial
    tanker out at sea. The only land they saw in months was the coast
    of Oman, which looked like a giant sand dune to Scott. They
    sailed east out of the Arabian Sea only after another oiler came
    out to relieve them. The nearest he’d been to Iraq was hundreds
    of miles south. The war continued on without him, without the
    promised end.

   He had no place to live. But he had six months’ wages, almost
   twenty thousand dollars, in cash in a pouch hung around his neck.
   He picked the Plymouth Fury because it was the biggest thing on
    the lot. It reminded him of something his father would have owned,
    with a hood that stretched out long in front of the windshield, sharp
    lines and square corners, a roar from the V8 when he turned the key
    that the dealer couldn’t guarantee was not due to a faulty muffler.
   The vinyl top had peeled, and the metal underneath showed rust,
    but the air-conditioning worked, and the radio was tuned to KNBR,
    the San Francisco Giants station, and the utter rightness of sitting in
    a big car listening to the pregame show in late September sold him.
     Scott’s insurance had expired, but the dealer arranged to sell
   him two weeks’ worth of coverage through the Internet, so he
    could get off the lot and have something until he got settled. Then
    he took off on Highway 101 and headed toward the Santa Clara
    Valley, San José, home.
     He checked into the El Rancho Motel, about ten miles from
   where Katherine was living with her father. The El Rancho was one
    of a few old motels, built along freeways in the fifties in California,
    that had survived into the age of franchises and centralized regis-
    tration systems. He took a room on the second floor, paying for a
   week in cash. The room had heavy plastic drapes covering a single
   window, a sheet-metal box that controlled both the heat and the
    air-conditioning, a lowboy chest of drawers, a twenty-three-inch
    tv, and a king-size bed.
     Scott had only a large duffel bag for luggage, and he threw it
    onto the lowboy, kicked off his shoes, and fell back into bed. He
   breathed in and out deeply, [softly, ] [trying ] [to ] [feel ] [he ][was ] [at ] [a ] [home- ]
   coming, trying to feel he had accomplished [something, ] [trying ] [to ]
    feel he was in control.
     The following afternoon, he drove by the house on Catesby
    Street. The driveway was empty, though he noticed one oil spot that
   looked fresh. Katherine probably still hadn’t repaired the oil leak
    in her Saturn. The blinds were drawn, and the aluminum-frame

    the side of the house were growing tall and awkward, with spin-
    dly sprays of faded blossoms hanging down, and the other shrubs
    needed pruning. There was work he could do.
     Next to his father-in-law’s house, someone had bought two of
    the old ranch houses from the original subdivision and razed them
    and was erecting a two-story house in their place. This had hap-
    pened since he left. The house was already framed up and sided,
    and it pushed out close to the property lines on both sides with
     a steep-pitched roof towering over everything else on the street.
    Scott looked at it as he drove by slowly, wondered about the square
    footage, the number of bathrooms, the number of bedrooms. But
    he had no doubt, he was looking at a multimillion-dollar house.
    Once a house was grand enough to deserve that title, any further
    precision about the actual price seemed superfluous.
      At the end of the block, he turned the Fury around and cruised
    back by his father-in-law’s house. He envisioned a house even
    larger than the one being built rising from the land. And he
    thought that if the old slab house could be torn down, or if a fire
    should strike it, it could be worth a fortune. A fortune.
      Scott left for an hour and came by one more time close to five. A
    Buick LeSabre was in the driveway—his father-in-law was home.
     Scott looked at his watch. He knew his father-in-law’s habits, and
    he knew he had been at the Garden Spot all afternoon.
     The next day, Scott parked the Fury right in front of the house,
     so that anyone who saw him would think he had nothing to hide. A
    narrow walkway alongside the garage where the garbage can sat led
     to a gate into the fenced backyard. A single-paned aluminum-sash
    window opened from the sunken den onto the cement slab patio. It
    was simple to jimmy the screen—the aluminum bent easily, and he
    would reshape and reinstall it before he left. He grasped the win-
    dow frame and hoisted himself up, ducked his head through, and
    put a foot down on a black sofa before stepping onto the floor.
     The house was weirdly quiet. He had been in his father-in-law’s
    house many times, but never alone. He took two steps, then

   off his shoes. In his stocking feet, he made a round of the house,
   crouching down near any windows that faced the street. He saw
   that Henry remained in the master bedroom. His wife’s room held
   objects he knew from their own room together. A wooden tree that
   held bracelets and necklaces, a frame screwed to the wall with
   earrings hanging from it, three bottles of perfume, a small lamp
   shaped like a tulip. There was nothing from Betty. She must have
   moved out, as Katherine said in one of her letters.
    He wondered whether Katherine slept in the upper or lower
   bunk bed. Both of them were neatly made with bedspreads that
   probably dated from the time she’d lived here as a girl, purple che-
   nille with a fringe of small dangling balls. He lifted a corner of the
   bedspread on the top bunk carefully and saw that there were no
   sheets underneath. The bottom bunk had sheets, and Scott smiled,
   pleased with himself. He sat down on the edge of the bed, and
   swung his feet onto it, and lay still.
    He felt the house breathing all about him. The stillness that ear-
   lier had seemed weird and threatening now felt warm, envelop-
   ing. He didn’t feel like a sneak or a thief. He felt like he was right
   where he belonged. He felt he could go to sleep peacefully here,
   and peacefully awake.
    His watch beeped, and he opened his eyes. He had set the timer
   to remind him when he had an hour left before he had to go. He
   made the bed carefully, so that the bedspread was arranged identi-
   cally to the one on the upper bunk, and he went into his son’s room.
    There was a twin bed on one side of the room and a cheap com-
   puter desk in the corner. Nothing on the walls except a poster with
   a saying by Chief Seattle [that ] [he ] [remembered ] [from ] [Carter’s ] [room ]
   in their old house. He looked [in ][the ] [closet ] [and ] [didn’t ] [see ] [anything ]
   that would let him know what [his ] [son ] [had ] [been ] [thinking ] [or ] [feeling ]
   while he had been gone. [Just ][jeans, ] [T-shirts, ] [a ][windbreaker, ] [sweat- ]
   shirts. One sports coat [that ] [he ] [wore ] [to ] [church, ] [with ][a ][clip-on ] [tie ]
   attached to the lapel. [Scott ] [made ] [a ] [mental ] [note ] [to ] [teach ] [Carter ] [to ]
   knot a real tie as soon as possible.

    than anywhere else.
     He looked at his watch. Then he tiptoed back to the den, put his
    shoes on, and replaced the screen, pushing it back into shape. He
    left by the back door, walked back out to his Fury, and drove back
    to the El Rancho.
     The next day, Scott entered the house the same way. He went to
    Katherine’s bed and lay down for a half hour. Then he went into
    his son’s room and turned on his computer. As the screen bright-
    ened, he got down on his knees and looked at the back of the com-
    puter tower. They still had dial-up Internet service. At their house
    in Oak Commons, they had always upgraded to the fastest possible
    service as soon as it was available. For the kids. Was this a measure
    of how Carter was suffering? Slow and outdated Internet service?
     He clicked on Explorer to look at the favorites, what was book-
    marked, what sites had been recently visited. There were a cou-
    ple of sites related to Shakespeare. A school project. Scott nodded
    approvingly. He opened up Word and looked at the documents
    Carter had recently written. One on The Tempest had been saved
    last night, probably still in progress.
     He began to search through other documents on the hard drive.
    He didn’t admit it, but he was looking for something about him-
     self. Some kind of journal, a letter never sent. He was searching
    for the profile he formed in his son’s imaginative horizon, the dark
    cutout figure of the absent. He wanted to know he was missed, and
    he wanted to know exactly how he was missed, the quality of his
    son’s regret for his departure. He felt he didn’t know his son very
    well, felt he had only fulfilled the external forms and ceremonies
    of being a father. If he knew how his son missed him, he might
    know how his son needed him to be.
     When his watch beeped again, he had found nothing, and he
    had to shut the computer down. On his way out, he stopped where
    keys hung from a row of hooks and found a ring with a number
    of similar keys. One fit the back door, and he took it with him. He
    could make a copy and return it before anyone noticed.

```

```
   came every two or three days after replacing the key, so that his
   car wouldn’t become too conspicuous. He grew comfortable with
   the routine. The house changed about him as he spent time in its
   rooms, mellowed into a warm, familiar place. He left his Fury,
   walked around the back, opened the door, kicked off his shoes. He
   glanced at the books on his father-in-law’s desk in the den, looked
    at the catalogs and magazines that had come in the mail since his
   last visit. He peeked inside the refrigerator, always pretending to
   himself that he might want a snack of some kind, always pretend-
   ing that he wasn’t really hungry.
    He circled back continuously to his wife’s bed and his son’s com-
   puter. In other places, the bad moments could suddenly rear up,
   force themselves before him with their awful presentness: the way
   he’d managed to lose money, the way he’d been laid off, the way he
    felt when he received the tax bill and knew that he couldn’t hide any-
   thing from Katherine. But he found, when he lay in the lower bunk,
   where Katherine had slept a few hours earlier, his mind quieted.
    At his son’s computer, he felt more urgency. He was continu-
   ally hunting for how Carter felt about him. He read school papers
   Carter had written six months ago. He visited the websites Carter
   had been on. He tried logging onto his son’s email a number of
   times, thinking that somehow he would guess the password. But it
    all remained obscure to him. He wanted to find something magi-
   cal, like a golden key in a children’s fairy tale, which would let him
   into the tower. So that when he saw Carter again, they could share
   a perfect understanding.
    On a hutch by the dining room table, there was always a stack of
   unopened mail addressed to Katherine. [Offers ] [to ] [open ] [new ] [credit ]
   card accounts, offers to transfer [balances, ] [envelopes ] [full ] [of ][coupons, ]
   bulk mailers promising [to ] [help ] [you ] [lose ] [weight, ] [promising ] [a ] [face ]
   cream that made wrinkles [disappear, ] [promising ] [an ] [herbal ] [supple- ]
   ment that would cure [the ] [terrifying ] [diseases ] [that ] [threatened ] [you. ]
   There were statements [from ] [credit ] [cards, ] [unopened ] [bills. ] [Scott ]
   began to rifle through [the ] [envelopes ] [on ] [every ] [visit, ] [shaking ] [his ] [head ]

    understand why she couldn’t just open up junk mail right away,
    glance at it, and toss it. He didn’t understand why she couldn’t just
    open up a credit card statement when it came, instead of waiting, as
    though the amount due was going to go down if she let it ripen a bit.
     After three weeks, he found in the pile a bank statement
    addressed to himself, forwarded from the address in Oak Com-
    mons. He had finally opened a bank account and deposited the
    thousands of dollars in cash he’d been carrying, and he’d used
    the Oak Commons address since it was the address on his driv-
    er’s license and passport. In Katherine’s hand, he saw “Not at
    this address” scrawled. He pocketed the envelope. He was at this
    address, even though she didn’t know it yet. He wondered if she
    would notice the missing envelope and found himself hoping she
    would.
     Two days later, he found a credit card statement of hers that
    had been opened but remained in the pile. Carefully, he slid the
    statement out of the envelope and scrutinized it. He saw where
    she had shopped last month, the kinds of things she had spent
    money on. Clothes for herself, clothes for Carter, school supplies,
    new tires for the Saturn, gasoline. It all added up.
     Then he saw that last month, she had paid only the minimum
    on the balance. That was crazy. She had never been good at man-
    aging credit. That was something else that had always frustrated
    him. They were going to have to sit down and talk over how to
    manage money. He found himself beginning a conversation with
    her right there, completely convincing her of the need to pay off
    balances every month, the foolishness of considering clothing “an
    investment,” the vicious cycle that the credit card companies were
    sucking her into. The responses he imagined from her tended to be
    questions he was able to answer, and she never brought up the fact
    that he’d cashed out their retirement accounts. The entire conver-
    sation was very satisfactory. So satisfactory that he promised to pay
    part of her balance if she would change her ways. And he wrote
    down the payment address and her account number.

   ules that they had hardly seen each other. But that was something
   they could work on, spending more time together. Quality time.
    When he left, he forgot about paying her bill and instead drove
   to Macy’s to buy perfume. A woman about Katherine’s age was
   behind the counter, and he told her that the perfume was a gift
   for his wife, that he gave it to her only on special occasions, like
   their anniversary. She misunderstood and thought that their anni-
   versary was coming up, and he found it easy to go along with her
   mistake, so easy to talk about their twenty-third anniversary, two
   children (teenagers, you know), a cozy house. As he talked, it all
   sounded right and good, and he loved the approving smiles she
   lavished on him. When he left, she said, “She’s gonna love it’ and
   even though he had been telling lies, he believed the salesperson
   was speaking the truth.
    The next day, he left the perfume, gift-wrapped, on the dining
   table. Something was going to happen now. He was sure of it.
   After Katherine knocked, she opened the door. The living room
   was empty. She glanced at the kitchen and down into the den, but
   he wasn’t there. She had expected him to be waiting for her. What
   else could the perfume have meant but a desire to meet? And the
   knocks on the door were a way to alert him, so that he’d be stand-
   ing, ready to talk.
    But he wasn’t standing, ready to talk, and as she paused in the
   kitchen, she grew furious. Everything about the way Scott was
   going about this was so typical. He could never be open and up
   front about anything. He always expected things to fall into place,
   expected Katherine to fill in [the ] [gaps ] [in ] [their ] [relationship, ] [and ]
   then he turned passive and whiny [when ] [something ] [went ] [wrong. ]
   He hadn’t told her about their money [troubles ] [up ] [front ] [because ]
   he thought she’d just know [somehow. ] [He ] [avoided ] [agreeing ] [to ] [a ]
   divorce because he would [rather ] [have ] [things ] [work ] [out, ] [and ] [then ]
   he disappeared after [losing ] [his ][job ][without ] [telling ] [her ] [that ] [he ][was ]

     off. And his bright idea of breaking into her father’s house was just
     a way to provoke her into recognizing his presence and his right
     to be here instead of being an adult, a man, and taking some god-
    damned initiative.
     She stalked into Carter’s room. Nothing. Then she looked into
    her bedroom.
      Incredible. He was sleeping on top of the bedspread of her
    bunk. As she stood in the doorway, he stirred but didn’t open his
    eyes. She had seen this face in this attitude thousands of times over
    the years. It occurred to her that she had seen this face asleep more
    than she would ever see any other face in her life, more than either
    of her children, more than any new love she might find. This face
    would stay at the gates of her dreams. It was still a handsome face,
    sharp black eyebrows and a straight nose and a jawline that some-
    how evaded the sagging fleshy wattle that came to men in their
     forties. And his body seemed tauter, as though some months at sea
    had tanned him like leather.
     Then she thought of his card—I’/l be seeing you in all those old
    familiar places—and here he was, in that most familiar place, with-
     out even bothering to ask, without even bothering to say hello first.
     It was too much.
      She snatched the pillow from the upper bunk and hit him across
     the face with it. He sat up, startled, and she smacked him again.
      Sitting outside in the Buick, Henry witnessed a miraculous sight.
    There was his son-in-law, bursting out the front door and running
    with his arms raised about his head. Followed by his daughter,
    splendid in her anger, raging after him with a pillow in both hands.
    When he slowed to try to speak, she whaled away at him, buffeting
    him about the shoulders, until he finally broke into a run for the
    Fury. He locked the doors and started the car with a smoky roar
    while she beat upon the driver’s side window. As the Fury pulled
    away, she raised both arms, like a goddess rampant and triumphant.

                        ,
  SOME WEEKS BEFORE his father reappeared, Carter began
   attending Montalvo High School. Because of the move to his
   grandfather’s house, he came with no group of friends from mid-
   dle school, no circle he could eat lunch with, and he felt like an
   outsider. All the people from his middle school went to Oak Com-
  mons High School across town, a newer school surrounded by
   newer houses, and even though they promised to keep up with
   each other, the separation began almost as soon as Carter left.
    Montalvo High had been built in 1960, after the first subdivi-
   sions had sprung up in the old orchards and the first baby boomers
   were approaching high school age. The school spread out broad
   and low amid the subdivisions, one-story buildings separated by
   open walks and cement planters, no enclosed hallways because of
   the mild weather. The buildings all had generous eaves that cov-
   ered banks of school lockers, and most classrooms were entered
   directly from the exterior. One central plaza, with tables and
   benches, was open to the sky.
    Carter had the sense, at his new school, that everyone knew
   exactly how to de except for him. Everyone knew how to dress,
  how to talk, how to hang [out, ] [except ] [for ] [him. ] [There ] [were ] [groups ]
   of students who looked [alike, ] [some ] [with ] [leather ] [and ] [silver ] [riv- ]
   ets and piercings, others [with ] [baggy ] [pants ] [and ] [skateboards, ] [who ]
   formed their own closed [circles. ] [The ] [Hispanic ] [kids ] [tended ] [to ] [clus- ]
   ter together in one part [of ][the ] [plaza, ] [as ] [did ] [the ] [black ] [kids ] [and ] [the ]
   Indian kids. From the [outside, ] [they ][all ][looked ] [to ] [have ] [a ] [social ] [ease ]
   and knowing that [he ][thought ] [he ][would ] [never ] [have. ]
    Carter was more than six feet tall, but he tried to hide it by
   slouching. He wasn’t proud of his body because he was so thin,
   and he compensated by wearing loose, oversize sweatshirts that
   flapped about him. He wasn’t happy with his face, either. He had

     that could be loved.
     He kept hidden the disappearance of his father at his new school.
     It was too weird, and he already felt weird enough. Divorce, sepa-
     ration, those were known categories he could fit into. There were
    plenty of kids his age who could talk knowledgeably about custody
    arrangements, the complications of having two bedrooms, the kind
    of takeout food favored by one parent over another. But nobody
    had ever said anything about having a father who appeared only as
    handwritten letters from a ship in the Arabian Sea.
     The war in Iraq was six months old then, and though it had
    seemed over at one point, it had risen again, metamorphosed into a
    new and murderous shape. Carter found the war was talked about
     differently at Montalvo High School than at Oak Commons Middle
    School. Everyone at Oak Commons, it seemed, and everyone at his
    church, had been against the war. Carter had joined in an antiwar
    march in the weeks leading up to the war and a noontime peace
     rally at the school. He felt good to be surrounded by people who
     felt as he did, comforted. And he didn’t mention his father ship-
    ping out to anyone. He was embarrassed to have a father who not
    only was prowar, but who had actually gone off to join it.
      It was different at Montalvo. Many students had older brothers
    and sisters in the military, some of whom had been part of the
    drive to Baghdad. Those students, both boys and girls, had a pho-
    tograph of a marine or soldier taped inside their locker doors, the
    kind of portrait taken at the end of boot camp, when a young man
     or woman is newly minted a warrior. The photos were of young
    men mostly, their faces shaved and unlined and achingly young,
    holding their chins high above the severe collar of the blue marine
    dress uniform, the white hat with the eagle and the globe always
    seeming a bit too large for them, a bit of a burden to hold up. The
    students with photos in their lockers were prowar—they couldn’t
    imagine being otherwise.
      Carter didn’t know how to talk with them. Among the people
    of his church, the deaths that occurred on a daily basis were proof

```

```
   ing. So Carter kept silent at his new school. He was fifteen, and he
   didn’t feel confident enough to speak up unless he knew that he
  would be agreed with.
  As the second anniversary of 9/11 came up, all of Carter’s old
   friends at Oak Commons High planned to wear antiwar T-shirts.
  Someone had discovered a website advocating that students wear
   a public display of protest, and they emailed Carter to get him to
   participate at Montalvo. Carter emailed back that he didn’t think
  anyone at his new school was going to do that. Not everyone was
  prowar, but a lot of people were, and he thought they would be
   hostile. His friends emailed back that it was going to be big, that
   a lot of people at a lot of high schools were going to do it. If he
  showed up wearing a T-shirt, he would find others who were
  wearing T-shirts too, and then he would know who was cool. Car-
   ter knew almost nobody at his new school, and he didn’t want to
   lose his friends from his old school, so he agreed to do it.
    Carter walked to school that day, wearing a loose chamois shirt
  open over his T-shirt. He arrived fifteen minutes before first period
   and walked around the plaza past the various social groups that
   were beginning to form. Each [group ] [had ] [its ] [own ] [corner ] [staked ]
   out. He sneaked looks at people, tried to spot anyone else wearing
   a shirt in protest of the war. [Nobody ] [was. ] [In ] [front ] [of ][the ] [Drama ]
   Building, a couple of picnic [benches ] [were ] [set ] [up, ] [and ] [Cal ] [Baker ]
   and Jeffrey Thomas, both [seniors, ] [were ] [lounging ] [back ] [and ] [wait- ]
   ing for the first bell. Cal [was ] [one ] [of ][the ] [good-looking ] [boys, ] [with ]
   short brown hair that [had ] [a ] [natural ] [wave ] [and ] [perfect ] [features. ] [Jef- ]
   frey was short, but massive. [His ] [arms ] [and ] [thighs ] [were ] [enormous, ]
  and his body was [thick ] [and ] [solid. ] [He ] [lifted ] [weights ] [daily, ] [and ] [it ]
   was rumored he took [steroids. ] [Neither ] [of ][them ] [wore ] [anything ] [that ]
   referred to the war.
    Carter raised a hand in greeting, and the two boys nodded. “’Sup?”
   said Jeffrey.

```

```
      The first short period was homeroom, and the day began with
     the Pledge of Allegiance. In middle school, everyone stood for the
     pledge. In high school, everyone had been too cool to stand and
    simply sat and allowed the pledge to be read over the pa system.
     But at Montalvo High School, after 9/11, students began standing
     again and were still doing it when Carter began there. Especially
     on the anniversary of the attack, everyone would stand.
      The classroom flag was tiny, about the size of a piece of binder
     paper, and it hung from a thin black dowel canted out from the
     wall near the clock. When the round speaker began to crackle,
     Mr. Elliott, an English teacher, stood and faced it, and the class
     did as well. Carter stood straight, and his shirt fell open. Two girls
     on either side noticed what his shirt said, and their eyes widened.
    Then, in the middle of the pledge, Mr. Elliott glanced his way.
      “Peace!” he blurted.
     Everyone turned to look. Carter took the chamois shirt off and
     stood with his T-shirt exposed. He tried to act casual, as though he
    was not taking off his shirt for any special reason, but he felt his
     heart ring in his chest.
     Above them, the school secretary’s voice asked for a moment of
     silence in memory of September 11th before the announcements.
      The pathways between the buildings, asphalt and pebbled
     concrete, were always crowded between classes. The sheet-metal
     locker doors opened and slammed shut under the eaves as stu-
     dents switched books and binders between classes, and talk filled
     the open space. Many students, even while they were talking,
    checked cell phones for text messages or thumbed in quick mes-
     sages themselves. Carter put his chamois shirt back on, but he
     didn’t make an effort to hide the slogan. In the center of the
     plaza, where students walked rapidly in both directions, he saw
    some faces recognize the shirt, register surprise. Then he was past
    them, on his way to chemistry. He looked for other shirts, or some
     sign of his friends’ idea that a war protest had spread, but he saw
     nothing.

```
  people kept walking past him. He looked around to see if some-
   one was looking at him, was claiming credit for the blow, but
   there was no one. Whoever had thrown the punch had continued
  walking. Just a quick sneaky fist square at the sternum, no eye
   contact, no explanation. It was as though the crowd as a whole
  had struck at him.
    Between English and algebra class, it happened again. A punch
  from nowhere, given in a crowd, stiff enough to stop Carter where
   he stood. He rubbed his chest, feeling the soreness. Again between
   third and fourth periods, even though he was watching, someone
   hit the same spot, a fist from the disapproving crowd. It happened
   once more, just before lunch, and he went down on one knee
   as the students marched about him. One of the janitors, a short
  man with iron-gray hair and a permanent scowl on his face from
   a career of dealing with the garbage of teenagers, saw Carter go
   down. He went to him and helped him up and, without a word,
  walked him to the main office.
    After a half hour, Carter went in to see his counselor, Mr. Geof-
   frey Hartmann. Mr. Hartmann arranged his office as much as pos-
   sible to resemble that of an Oxford don or an Ivy League professor.
  He wore tweed jackets and had his diplomas framed and on the
   wall, along with a fading photograph of a rugby side he’d played
   on in college. He kept several [pipes ] [in ] [a ] [pipe ] [rack ] [and ][a ][vintage ]
   Boston Coarse Cut tobacco [tin ] [on ] [the ] [shelf ] [behind ] [him, ] [and ] [even ]
  though smoking had long [been ] [forbidden ] [indoors, ] [a ] [faintly ] [sweet ]
   scent of pipe tobacco hung [in ] [the ] [office. ] [Whenever ] [he ] [signed ] [any- ]
   thing, he used a fountain [pen ] [and ][a ][rocker ] [blotter ] [with ] [a ] [mahog- ]
   any handle. He told himself [that ] [these ] [touches, ] [these ] [accoutre- ]
   ments, were to inspire [his ] [students ] [to ] [go ] [to ] [college, ] [but ] [they ][were ]
   really the little ways [he ][compensated ] [for ][a ][disappointing ] [career. ]
    Carter sat down in one of two bow-back chairs placed at angles
   in front of the desk while Mr. Hartmann leaned back and perused
   his file. Carter sat straight, so that the slogan on his T-shirt was
   plainly visible. He had decided that he was being persecuted for

```

```
    meant something. Jesus suffered for his beliefs too. And Gandhi.
      Mr. Hartmann creaked his chair forward and laid the file flat on
     the desktop and tapped it significantly with his index finger. “You
    came from Oak Commons Middle School,’ he said. “You must
    have moved.”
     esa
      “Any problems adjusting?”
      Carter had been to a therapist a couple of times after his father
    moved out. His mother’s insurance policy provided for ten visits
    with a mental health professional per year, and she had made him
    go without ever going herself. The therapist had asked the same
    question, to get the conversation started, and then wanted to pre-
     scribe an antidepressant. After the second visit, Carter decided he
     didn’t like her. She seemed to think she knew all about him, and
    Mr. Hartmann seemed to think he knew all about him as well.
      “I’m fine,” Carter said. “I just like to show my beliefs.”
      “Well. We all have our beliefs. But if those beliefs upset others,
    they might be kept private.”
      “But there’s freedom of speech, isn’t there?”
     “Of course. But in a civilized society, we learn to respect that
    others have opinions as well. And it’s best, if we’re to keep func-
     tioning, to avoid incitement.”
      “So you think it’s my fault.” Carter crossed his arms in front of
     his chest.
     “Of course not.”
      “I know what you’re saying. I’m gifted in English. You think
     I’ve got family trauma, and that’s the real reason I wore this shirt
     on 9/11. You don’t think I’m sincere.”
      “Listen. Carter.”
      Mr. Hartmann leaned forward, the leather elbow patches on his
    jacket propped on his desktop. He tried to sound as earnest and
    understanding as possible.
     “There are students here who have close family members in Iraq
    right now, though nobody has lost anyone yet, thank God. I believe

```

-----

```
    “If my dad was in Iraq, I could wear whatever I wanted?”
    Mr. Hartmann hesitated. He doubted whether Carter’s father
  was in Iraq, but he saw the boy ready to pounce.
    “No,” he said at last.
    “It’s the same rules for everyone?”
    “Yes. That’s fair, isn’t it?”
    “What if I wore the shirt like civil disobedience? Like Gandhi?”
    “Then you would probably end up right back in this office.”
    “Like Gandhi would.”
    Mr. Hartmann let Carter go after he agreed to keep his chamois
   shirt buttoned the rest of the day. Carter wouldn’t promise never
   to wear a protest shirt again, because he didn’t want to give up his
  freedom of speech, and Mr. Hartmann finally said that as long as
   he understood that there were consequences, he could make his
  own choices.
    It was near the end of lunch period when Carter was finally
   released. The plaza was bright and hot, and nobody was walking
   across it. Students had all gathered in the small areas they had
   claimed as their own, with friends and books and iPods and cell
   phones, waiting for the bell to announce the first afternoon class.
   Carter walked across the plaza [toward ] [the ] [Drama ] [Building, ] [feel- ]
   ing watched. He had his chamois [shirt ] [buttoned, ] [but ] [he ] [walked ]
   erect, not slouching. He [felt ] [as ] [though ] [Mr. ] [Hartmann’s ] [warnings ]
   had made him grander and [more ] [important ] [than ] [before. ]
    In the first afternoon class, the teacher tried to lead a discussion
   about the terrorist attacks and what they meant for the country.
   She and others at the school had downloaded lesson plans from
   websites, and a lot of the emphasis was on letting students express
   their feelings and making sure that they felt safe in school. The
   discussion didn’t touch on the war in Iraq, though the teacher, a
  young woman who was already thinking about a real estate license
   as a way to escape teaching in the public schools the rest of her
   life, invited the class to write about the troops in the last ten min-
   utes of class. Carter kept silent for the entire period, enjoying the

```

-----

```
    period drilling on the irregular verb tener.
      As soon as he left the school grounds, Carter opened the shirt
    and let the slogan show while he walked toward home. Some
     seniors drove to and from school, but Carter only had a learner’s
    permit, and his mother was not anxious for him to get his license
    because of the insurance costs. He was getting driving lessons from
     his grandfather, but there was never a fixed date at which he’d take
     his driving test. To get home, he had to walk from the high school
     to Prospector Street, a commercial strip with gas stations and strip
    malls. He couldn’t take a more direct route because an expressway
    lay between the school and his grandfather’s house. Prospector
    intersected with Saratoga Avenue, which ran between the Western
    Horizons shopping center and the Blue Skies Bowl, and Country
    Lane Road led into the subdivision just beyond the bowling alley.
      Before he got to Prospector Street, a purple car sped toward him
    with the windows rolled down, and three older boys inside shouted
     at him. He couldn’t understand the words, something “Terrorist,”
    but they were yelling and pointing at him, and he hunched his
    shoulders as though a rock had been thrown at him.
     Then the purple car was past, and he was untouched. He looked
    up and down the busy street. It was like a long chute, the road
    channeled between tall stucco walls that marked the edges of sub-
    divisions. There were two lanes going each direction and left-turn
    channels where there was an entry road into the housing. The
    sidewalk was squeezed between the road and the tall walls. More
     cars passed him, disregarded him, and after a moment he contin-
    ued walking.
     On the other side of the center strip, the purple car drove past
    him. The boys in the car saw that he had noticed them, pointed at
    him. He turned his head. The car made a U-turn at the first break
    and sped up toward him again. Carter waited. On the other side
    of the stucco walls were green backyards, but the walls were ten
    feet tall. He heard the yelling, and the car swerved toward him and
    made him jump back.

```
   Street and turn left. There were several hundred yards to Prospec-
   tor, and he began to walk quickly and decided to button his shirt.
  He would feel safer near the businesses, where there were other
  people around.
    Prospector Street was lined with steel lamp poles and creosote-
  soaked telephone poles that smelled on hot sunny days, and the
  sidewalk was discontinuous, appearing in front of a fast-food fran-
   chise and then disappearing in front of gas stations and used-car
   lots. Carter never saw anyone else walking along it, as he did. The
   cars passed close as he walked and made the air thick and heated,
  and the only people he saw were clerks, standing outside their
   small businesses, smoking a cigarette until a car pulled into the
  narrow parking lot in front of them.
    He was in front of a Rotten Robbie’s gas station when the
  purple Tiburon reappeared. He saw it coming, but there was
  nowhere for him to go. He angled across the asphalt, close to the
  open glass doors of Mrs. Robbie’s Food Shop, the tiny convenience
   store that stood back from the gas pumps.
    The Tiburon pulled into the parking lot alongside the store and
  jerked to a halt, and three boys piled out. They were students at
   the high school who all had older brothers in the military and
  who ganged together because of it. K. J., the driver, had a brother
  with the Fourth Infantry Division in Iraq. Mitch’s brother was on
   a destroyer in the Arabian Sea, and Brownie’s brother was in the
   Marines, though currently based in South Korea, which seemed
   kind of lame, so they didn’t talk about it.
    K. J. was short and wiry and always in motion, too impatient
   to be good in school, though [he ] [knew ] [he ] [was ] [smarter ] [than ] [his ]
   teachers thought. Acne [scarred, ] [not ] [tall ] [enough ] [or ] [strong ] [enough ]
   or fast enough to be in [sports, ] [he ][had ] [been ] [one ] [of ][the ] [kids ] [without ]
   a place until his brother [overseas ] [finally ] [gave ] [him ] [something ] [to ]
   feel special about. He [claimed ] [that ] [he ] [was ] [going ] [to ] [join ] [up ] [too, ]
   after high school, and [serve ] [right ] [alongside ] [his ] [brother. ] [Tip ][of ][the ]
   spear, he said, tip of [the ] [spear, ] [and ] [he ] [talked ] [knowingly ] [about ] [the ]

```

```
      His brother had left the car with K. J. and told him to use it until
    he came back, and having a car made him feel larger, tougher. His
    brother had also left him a leather aviator jacket that he wore all
     the time, though it was a little oversized for him.
     When Brownie told K. J. about the new kid, he felt that the kid
    was taking something from him by wearing a T-shirt against the
     war. K. J. already hated students like Carter, the well-behaved kids,
     the ones who tested well, the ones in the fast classes. He resented
    them. He thought they must have been brought up in an atmo-
    sphere of safety, a bubble of privilege in which they thought they
    could say anything. And he thought this new kid might need to
    have his ass kicked.
     The three boys formed a knot around Carter, blocking off the
    doorway to the business.
     “Hey!” K.J. bounced on the balls of his feet, grinning and
    manic. “I gotta question for you.”
      “Yeah?” Carter stopped.
     “When did you stop being a fag?”
      “Never,” Carter said.
     “You never stopped? That means you must still be one.”
     K. J. laughed, and the boys behind him punched each other.
      “I mean I never was one.”
     “Maybe you’re just a big pussy instead,” Mitch said.
      “You don’t know me,” Carter said.
     “Open your shirt,” K. J. said. “I want to read what it says.”
     “What if I don’t want to?”
     “What if we make you?”
      Carter looked around. The clerk behind the counter was talking
     on a cell phone. And if he had glanced through the glass windows,
    he would just have seen four high school kids and wondered if
    they were going to come in to try to buy cigarettes with fake 1p. On
     the street, the cars passed ignorantly by.
     “You know what it says already.”
     “Come on,” K. J. said. “Aren’t you proud of it?”

```

```
    “Okay.” Carter unbuttoned his shirt, and K. J. leaned in and
   made a show of studying it carefully, the acne scars reddish across
   his pale face.
    “Looks to me like it says, ‘I am a pussy terrorist.’ What’s it look
   like to you, Brownie?”
    “That’s it’ Brownie said.
    “Isn’t that what it says?” K. J. asked Carter.
    “No.”
    “Mitch thinks so. And Brownie thinks so. Looks like you’re out-
   voted.”
    “Okay.”
    “Okay what?”
    “Okay, I’m outvoted.”
    “So what does your shirt say?”
    “You know,” Carter said, “they persecuted Gandhi for what he
   said too.”
    “Yeah,” K. J. said. “But you’re not him.”
    “Can I go now?”
    “Is anybody stopping you?”
    Nobody moved, so Carter had to walk around the three boys.
    They waited until he was a dozen yards away, with his back
   turned, opposite the Dumpster alley. Then they rushed him,
   grabbed him on each side, and stumbled him toward the Dump-
   ster. Carter flailed away with his legs, his arms pinned. Two boys
   hoisted him up, half into the Dumpster, and dropped him.
    “Let’s bail,” K. J. yelled.
    By the time Carter pushed himself out, the doors were slam-
  ming on the purple Tiburon.
    He brushed himself off and watched the car screech its tires out
   of the parking lot. The smell of garbage was in his nose.

   KATHERINE THOUGHT about telling Carter that his father was
    back, but the whole episode seemed too absurd. She knew Car-
     ter would have questions about Scott, and she would be unable to
    answer any of them. Your father has been breaking into the house and
    sleeping in my bed. No, I didn’t really get a chance to ask how he was.
    No, we didn’t really talk about getting back together. No, he didn’t really
    ask about you. I chased him away with a pillow before he could. Other-
    wise, I’m. sure he would have, honey.
      It was easier for her to decide that Scott would soon be back in
    touch in a normal way. Carter would find out then and never have
     to know that he had broken into the house. It would save Scott
     some embarrassment.
    After wearing the shirt and finding no one else doing the same,
    after being thrown into the Dumpster, Carter didn’t tell anyone.
    At first, he had felt a kind of pride in being singled out because
    of his beliefs, but it soon turned into shame. He couldn’t imag-
    ine repeating the story to anyone and being proud of the way it
    had ended. He couldn’t imagine how to make it sound like being
    thrown halfway into a Dumpster made him come out on top. It
    could only sound humiliating. For a fifteen-year-old in a new
    high school, the notion of suffering for one’s beliefs didn’t keep
     its appeal for long.
     He couldn’t tell his grandfather, or his mother, or even Rev-
    erend Nancy at the church who had called this an evil war. Any
    one of them might decide to contact the school, call the principal,
    and use the institution to punish the three boys. If that happened,
    Carter would be sunk. The story would get around school, and he
    would be the boy who got thrown in the garbage forever. Famous!

    He began to brood on revenge fantasies of his own, heroic sce-
   narios. He vowed to wear an antiwar T-shirt again, once a month.
   And he saw himself inspiring others to wear antiwar slogans too,
    a group of them, and they would all drive down Prospector Street
   like a convoy and sweep purple Tiburons from the road. Or he saw
   himself in a car, finding one of the three—K. J., the ringleader—
   alone in an alley, helpless as he stomped on the accelerator. K. J.,
   scared of him, at his mercy.
     In the weeks after the 9/11 anniversary, Carter found himself
   gravitating toward the Drama Building. The groups there were not
   stringent about whom they would accept. He didn’t have to dress or
   look a certain way. There were girls who wore red or green berets
   and matching capes, a few of the black-leather girls, some boys
   with smooth faces and dark eyes and petulant lips. And there were
   others who were there because they didn’t fit in anywhere else and
   found they were praised if they could sing or play an instrument or
   memorize lines and enunciate.
     Carter’s gift was his voice, his clear and effortless tenor. When
   he spoke, even though his tone was in the upper registers, there
   was a weight and depth to it, so that his words penetrated. And his
   singing voice, with a slight vibrato, had been treasured by choir
   directors since elementary school. He joined the choir at Montalvo
   High, but the praise he got for [his ][voice ] [didn’t ] [seem ] [to ] [make ] [up ][for ]
   the lack he saw in himself when [he ][looked ] [in ][a ][mirror ] [and ] [studied ]
   his funny nose and ears and scrawny elongated frame.
    The voice teacher, Mrs. McCarthy, was severe and demanding.
   She wore starched white or cream blouses, always with a bow at
   the throat, and dark skirts, and she stood at the piano during class
   with her right index finger in the air and her left finger hammering
   the note she was seeking. She wanted him to be her special stu-
   dent, but he felt that she would be a teacher who would set hurdles
   for him, each one higher than the previous one, and that he would
   never be able to feel he had accomplished anything. The fragility
   he felt after his father left made him keep up his guard around her.

     The drama teacher was unlike anyone he had ever known. Her
    name was Carolyn Cotts, though everyone, including her students,
    called her by her nickname, Nu, a letter from the Greek alphabet.
    She was sixty, with the lined face that told her years, but she was
    as lithe as a girl, which she attributed to yoga and body work. She
    wore her red hair long, either loose or gathered into a soft rope
    along her shoulders, and she dressed eccentrically, sometimes
    showing up in jeans, sandals, and a smock, sometimes in a cot-
    ton peasant dress with a variegated handwoven shawl of her own
    making, and sometimes all in black, with a black turtleneck and
    barrette and black skirt and hose.
     The classes were all held in the theater. Oak Commons High,
    where Carter thought he was going to attend, had a new theater
    with banks of fixed and upholstered chairs rising around a thrust
    stage. At Montalvo, the theater building was forty years old, with a
    straight proscenium arch and a large open space filled with folding
    chairs during performances. Yet there was a sign hanging over the
    stage that bravely named it “The Theater of California.” Students
    had painted the sign in gold and blue after Nu told them that the
    name California came from a novel written by Ordofiez de Mon-
    talvo, in whose honor their school was named.
     The classes in drama were comforting for Carter. The students
    who had been together in theater in middle school took their
    cue from Nu and welcomed him in, and the juniors and seniors
    weren’t threatened by him. He felt less self-conscious of his looks
    in drama, because Nu always said that there were roles for all, the
    theater contains multitudes—kings and clowns and lovers and
    monsters, all have a place on the stage.
     From the beginning of class, they were reading Shakespeare
    because Nu had written a grant to a local foundation for one of
    their shows and had proposed they put on The Tempest. In class,
    Carter didn’t usually read the leading roles, Macbeth or Henry V
    or Othello. His high tenor voice and physical awkwardness fit him
    for comic roles, those who are tricked and befuddled, like Andrew

   sound more like it was being coined and spoken for the first time
   by a living and breathing human being.
    “Make it new,” she repeated. That phrase, from the modernists,
   was the origin of her nickname.
    In one of Nu’s classes, she had them work with makeup tech-
   niques, and he was paired up with a girl who wore a nose ring and
   dyed her hair black and had the funny name Blossom Haven. She
   explained once by saying that her mother was an old hippie. They
   now lived alone, she said, just the two of them, and her mother
   was still kind of a hippie, but had learned enough about massage
   therapy and Reiki to make the rent every month. Blossom Haven
   didn’t like to act, but she loved the technical side of theater, the
   lighting and the sets and the costumes and makeup. She said she
   wanted to be a best boy someday, so that when the credits rolled at
   the end of a movie, people would see: “Best Boy—Blossom Haven.”
    Nu went to each pair and gave directions as to what face they
   should put on the other. Some she directed to make very old, with
   lines on the forehead, crow’s feet at the corners of the eyes. Others
   she directed to make look like cavemen, with beetling brows and
   shadowed eyes. When she came to Carter, she paused.
    “Make him a drunk,” she said. “Make that beautiful Roman
   nose red as a cherry.”
    Carter leaned back and watched Blossom Haven’s face as she
   studied him and then the makeup kit beside her. She took a con-
   tainer of pancake from the box, moistened a sponge, and began to
   smooth the base onto his face. [She ] [blended ] [in ] [a ] [lighter ] [shade ] [of ]
   pancake onto his cheekbones, [to ] [make ] [them ] [stand ] [out, ] [and ] [then ]
   worked in spots of rouge [to ] [make ] [the ] [skin ] [florid. ] [Similarly ] [on ] [the ]
   nose, she first used foundation [to ] [emphasize ] [the ] [bone ] [structure, ]
   then worked in red [to ] [give ] [the ] [broken-veined ] [impression ] [of ] [a ]
   drinker, and she rimmed [the ] [bottom ] [of ][his ] [eyes ] [with ] [a ] [special ] [red ]
   eyeliner.
    The feel of her hands was calm and firm, and her face was calm
   as she worked. She didn’t interact with him. She looked at his

    unwilling to contribute when others offered takes on the strange
    and alien ways of their parents. He wasn’t sure if he fit into the cate-
    gory of having a single mother or not, and he kept quiet. Now he
    wished he had spoken, to give them something in common.
     Before the end of class, Nu had everyone walk across stage and
    improvise a character based on their makeup. The elderly hobbled
    about, and the cavemen grunted. One girl made up as a twenties
    flapper shimmied up to a boy made up as a sheikh. Carter was the
    only drunk, and he swayed his lanky body across the stage in an
    unsteady totter, seeming out of balance before just catching him-
    self to take one more step. He stopped and took out a handkerchief
    with exaggerated delicacy, and then he honked his nose into it,
    and the class laughed.
     He looked for Blossom Haven after class, before the next period
    started, but she seemed to have vanished. The open plaza, bro-
    ken with square cement planters, was busy with students walking
     to their next class, talking with friends, texting on their cells. He
    ducked back into the Drama Building and looked at the empty
    chairs. Then he walked across to the exit on the far side of the
    building, where the heavy metal door was propped open with a
    brick, and pushed through to the scruffy untended area behind
    the building, a dozen feet of rocky ground between the building
    and a chain-link fence that marked the edge of the school grounds.
    Beyond the fence, a row of tall spruce trees gave the space a feeling
    of privacy.
     Blossom Haven wasn’t there, but Nu was, leaning against the
    wall and smoking a cigarette. She smoked between every class,
    sometimes joined by students. She didn’t encourage them to
    smoke, but she said she wouldn’t be a hypocrite either, and she
    made everyone pick up their butts and scuff out their ashes so that
    the maintenance crew wouldn’t bust them. She smiled a welcome
     to Carter and didn’t look surprised to see him, even though he was
    not a smoker and not one of the regulars behind the building.
      “I can’t give you a cigarette,” she said. “I have some ethics.”

```

-----

```
    “Are you going to audition for the play?” Nu’s voice was low and
  husky, a smoker’s voice. “Next week?”
    “T don’t know.”
    “I wish you would.” Nu blew smoke down from the corner of
  her mouth away from Carter. She waved a hand in front of her.
  “Watch out. Secondhand smoke is worse than smoking.”
    Carter waved a hand in front of his face as well. Nu laughed and
   took another drag.
    “And you don’t want to audition because... .”
    “Well. Like. I don’t think I’m ready. Like, everyone else knows
   each other already, and I’m all new, we moved here from Oak
  Commons since my dad left last year, and I don’t know anyone
   here from middle school.” He began to tell her about moving into
   his grandfather’s house, and his grandfather’s chronic cancer, his
   sister leaving and telling him “Escape or die,” his mother trying to
   act like everything was normal, and how weird it all felt. He said
   to Nu the things he wanted to say to Blossom Haven, to grow the
   feeling that they had something in common. “I just feel like a freak
   here,’ he said.
    Nu had stubbed out her cigarette into a small portable ashtray
  and slid the metal cover back over it. She had been teaching for
  many years, and she knew when and how to listen. When he fin-
   ished, she put an arm around his shoulders and looked into his
   eyes.
   “When I see you in class, like I saw you today, I see a big fat joy.
  Big fat joy. Nothing freaky about that.”
    “And I’m not, you know, like Cal.”
    Nu knew what he meant by that. She had heard it many times.
   It was common enough in high [school. ] [Cal ][was ] [the ] [handsome ] [boy, ]
  and everyone else [fell ] [short. ] [She ] [had ] [a ] [stock ] [answer, ] [one ] [that ] [a ]
   director had given her [once ] [when ] [she ] [realized ] [that ] [she ] [had ] [a ][long ]
   face, a little horsey in [the ][way ] [her ] [small ] [mouth ] [was ] [dominated ] [by ]
  her flat cheeks.
    “In the Globe,” she said, “there’s room for all.”

    banks of the Thames.
     The second bell rang. She gave his shoulder a squeeze. “You’re
     late for class,” she said. “See you at auditions.”
      Carter felt relieved that he had finally told someone about his
     father, his mother, his grandfather. He’d felt like he’d had a big
    sign on his forehead saying, “Don’t make friends with this one.
    Too weird.” Telling Nu would make it easier to talk about them
    with the others. Maybe with Blossom Haven.
     For the first round of auditions, all the boys were to memorize
    Prospero’s speech, from act 5, where he vows to break his staff and
    drown his book after he has regained his dukedom and brought
    about a marriage between his daughter, Miranda, and the son of
     the king of Naples. Carter practiced it in the backyard, walking
    from the cement slab patio to the lawn and speaking to the cedar
     fences. There was one corner of the backyard that had been a veg-
     etable garden, with four tomato cages still standing at odd angles,
    now overgrown with weeds, and Carter addressed them as though
     the elves and fairies at Prospero’s command were dwelling within
    and ready to spring forth.
      As Carter strutted around the backyard, playing Prospero, his
    grandfather Henry sat in one of the patio chairs with a copy of the play
    open in his lap. Henry still felt heavy-bodied from a treatment a week
     earlier, but being with Carter eased him. When he found out that the
    big play of the fall was going to be The Tempest, and that Carter was
    going to audition for it, he picked up an old leather-bound edition of
    Shakespeare that had belonged to his own father and read it through.
     It seemed to him, more than anything, a play about a father trying
     to see that his daughter found happiness. The enchanted island of
     the play could be anywhere a father tried to help his children—like
     his own house, where in 1950 he’d hung the redwood sign from the
     front porch that read Peaceable Isle, to distinguish it from those islands
     he’d seen in the Pacific war, green and bloodsoaked.

   a redwood deck, or a roofed greenhouse, and had landscaped the
  back lawn into small oases, with garden seats and trellises and
  water features. He had left it the same patch of fescue and crab-
  grass as when he bought the house—at first because his young chil-
  dren could play on it, then, after his wife died, because he had lost
  the desire to change it. Only the rosebushes, trellised to the back
  wall, and the small rectangle of vegetable garden showed an effort
   to cultivate the space. His Peaceable Isle. A poor sort of enchanted
  island for a Prospero to rule over.
    “I have bedimmed the noontide sun, called forth .. 2” Carter
  paused. “Called forth...”
    “The mutinous winds,” Henry said.
    “The mutinous winds. Thanks, Grandpa.”
   Henry had never done this for his own children. His two sons
  were distant now, and visited rarely, and he had never been one to
  chat on the telephone just to stay in touch. That had been his wife’s
   role. He had let her be the one to keep the family close and to orga-
  nize their social life. He thought now that his sons had both been
   closer to their mother than to him, and he wondered if they would
  have moved so far away if she had lived.
   Mary Katherine’s death in 1973 still seemed like a cheat to him.
  She’d been beginning to move to the next stage of her life, with
  the two boys in college and Katherine in high school. She was
  always the joiner, the one who wanted to be involved in something
  larger. She’d left behind the prsa and the school board and was
  looking into joining the League of Women’s Voters. And on the
  way back from an evening meeting, she was killed on the freeway
  by a wrong-way driver. The police [never ] [discovered ] [why ][the ] [other ]
  driver was going the wrong way [or ] [even ] [where ] [he ] [had ] [gotten ] [on ]
  the freeway. A mystery. Impossible to make sense of.
   Henry never got the chance to see her age, never got to see her
  hair silver, and her eyes brighten through crow’s feet, and her
  voice gain an elder scratch. When he looked at himself in the mir-
  ror now, bald, even his eyebrows and eyelashes missing, she was

     bered her, beside an old hulk like him. It was a stupid thought,
     he knew, because she would have aged as well. But he imagined
     her young at his side, and the bright colors he wore, the silk scarf
     around his neck, the French beret, were all to look younger beside
     the conjured face of his wife.
      “And deeper than did ever plummet sound,” Carter said, “I'll
    drown my book.”
     Henry applauded as Carter bowed.
    When Katherine leaned in to Carter’s room in the evenings, to lis-
     ten to her son murmur low the lines, he inevitably noticed her and
     stopped.
     “Mom, I’m concentrating. This is important. This matters.”
      Katherine didn’t know exactly when it happened, but Carter had
     stopped confiding in her. It wasn’t when Scott had disappeared and
    when they had moved to Catesby Street. It had begun happening
     earlier, more gradually, as her son had carved out a private space for
     himself. But she noticed it more now. He had become more inward,
     took himself so seriously. It scared her that he took himself so seri-
     ously, because it left him so vulnerable to the bruises and hurts
     of the world. He didn’t talk about school, about his classes or the
     people he was meeting, and she thought he was hiding things from
     her. He’d had friends at the old middle school, but even though he
     claimed they were still friends through email and ims, he didn’t see
    them anymore. And she blamed herself because those friends might
     have been a cushion against the difficult changes, though she usu-
     ally remembered to blame Scott too for the situation they were in.
      Katherine had a habit of foreseeing catastrophe. She could envi-
     sion her airplane falling from the sky, her car ablaze, her son’s
     bicycle wrapped around the front of a truck. And she invented
     connections between the present and the future to keep catastro-
    phe at bay. She would tell herself, when driving on the freeway,
     that if she could just get safely to the next overpass, she would

  were safe from all other earthquakes for six months. Six months
  seemed like a reasonable amount of time to expect.
   Now she found herself making the same kind of deal for her
   son. She was happy he was concentrating on drama class, if it gave
  him a center. And she told herself that if he just got a part in this
  play, it would mean he would be safe from all harm for the rest of
   the school year. The auditions were held the first week in October,
  just days after she had chased Scott from the house. He hadn’t yet
   tried to get back in touch, and she still hadn’t told Carter that he
  was back. She didn’t want to upset him until he had a part for
  himself.
  Nu made the auditions as genuine and professional as possible. The
  drama room was dark, and a pool of light, a hot spot, was marked
  on the stage with an X of masking tape. Each student walked out to
   the hot spot and heard Nu’s voice rise from the obscurity.
    “So what are you going to do for us today?”
    One by one, Carter saw the other boys recite Prospero’s speech.
  Some stumbled over the language—some spoke well but were
   reciting rather than speaking as a character. Sometimes, Nu asked
   a student to repeat a line with a different inflection and intention.
  Cal spoke beautifully, as did a student named Francisco Vallejo,
  who wore his jet-black hair slicked back and had a small black
  chin beard.
   When Carter was called, he stepped out onto the stage and into
   the bright light. The light would [have ] [kept ][him ] [from ] [seeing ] [much ]
   of the audience even if [it ][weren’t ] [darkened, ] [but ] [he ] [could ] [hear ] [the ]
  students breathing while [they ][waited. ] [Nu ] [asked ] [him ] [to ] [start, ] [and ]
  he breathed deeply.
    Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves.
   He tried to speak in a lower range of voice than normal. He had
  noticed that the students who sounded best had deep voices, and
  he wanted to sound like them. He wanted to sound as though he

```
     He found himself running out of breath before the end of lines,
    having to run words together and then gulp in air. It was not as
    he had practiced. He didn’t forget any lines, but he began to rush
    toward the end, just wanting to get offstage.
     Then Nu’s voice floated up, cutting him off.
      “Carter?”
      Carter stopped, tried to look toward the voice.
      “Start over again,’ Nu said. “And I want you to speak as though
    you don’t believe a word you’re saying, as though you find the
    whole idea of being able to ‘bedim the sun at noon’ somewhat ludi-
     crous.”
      “Ludicrous?”
     “Funny. Something to make sport of.”
     “Okay.” Carter closed his eyes for a moment. Then he began
     the speech again in his own high tenor voice. He pranced lightly
    through the lines, making some of the most serious declarations
     into doubtful statements or questions. He heard some giggles, and
    when he came to the line about calling forth the mutinous winds,
    he turned his back to the audience and stuck out his buttocks and
    made a loud farting noise. There was laughter as he finished, and
    he made an exaggerated, loose-jointed bow.
     “Thank you,” Nu said, as she said at the end of everyone’s
     audition.
    Carter walked to school the next day, wearing again the T-shirt
    with the anti-war slogan underneath his chamois shirt. Three
    weeks had passed since he’d worn it, and it was October, and
    he had vowed that he would wear the shirt again. Even though
    nobody had heard the vow but him, it seemed terribly important to
    him that he fulfill it. He didn’t want to be the kind of person who
    took vows and then broke them. Prospero took a vow and had to
     leave his magic island, but it led to a happy ending for his daugh-
     ter, Miranda. It was important to Carter that he do the same. He

   his vow but still fit in.
    In homeroom that morning, when they stood up for the Pledge
   of Allegiance, Mr. Elliott glanced his way. Carter hadn’t taken off
   his chamois shirt, but it had fallen open enough for the slogan to
   be visible.
    “Bush,” Mr. Elliott blurted, and the rest of the class turned to
   stare.
    Carter was sent down to the counselor’s office, and Mr. Hartmann
   again tried to explain the limits on speech within the sphere of the
   high school. Just as you couldn’t shout “Fire” in a crowded theater,
  you couldn’t use disruptive speech in school. But Carter wasn’t per-
   suaded. Yelling “Fire” was banned only if it was a lie. If it were true,
   it wouldn’t be illegal. And the words on his T-shirt were true.
    Mr. Hartmann, seeing that rhetorical suasion wasn’t working,
   finally told him that the next time he wore a disruptive shirt, he
  would be sent home and his parents informed. And he told him to
   just sit outside the office for the rest of the period, until the bell rang.
    On his way to algebra, Carter saw a group of students outside
   the Drama Building, talking, waving their hands in the air, jump-
   ing up and down, and he thought the cast list must have been
   posted. He wanted to cross the plaza, to find out if he’d been cho-
   sen, if his name was beside one of those on the list of Dramatis
   Personae in the front of the book, but he didn’t want to be late to a
   class after already being in the office once.
    He stopped at his locker, under the broad eaves of one of the
   buildings. Then he joined the [busy ] [flow ] [of ] [students ] [filtering ] [by ]
   each other, turning into classrooms. [As ] [he ][was ] [walking, ] [he ][heard ] [a ]
   voice at his side.
    “You’re pissing me off, Cochran.”
    Carter looked to his left and found that K. J. was walking beside
  him in his leather jacket, shadowed by Brownie wearing a black
  hoodie that hid his face. K. J. spoke out of the corner of his mouth,
  keeping his eyes forward, not looking at Carter.
    “You must like getting your ass kicked.”

```
    passed him by, walking swiftly. Neither of them diverted their eyes
    or gave any hint that Carter had been addressing them.
     “Freedom of speech,” Carter said again to their departing backs.
    The second bell rang, and they were gone.
     After algebra, Carter walked swiftly across the grounds to the
    Drama Building. Outside, Cal and Jeffrey and some other boys
    were talking at one of the picnic tables. When Cal saw Carter
    approaching, he hailed him.
     “What ho, Trinculo!”
     “Trinculo is reeling ripe,” Jeffrey added. Carter heard him and
    began to walk like a drunk, exaggerating the ungainliness of his
    long, skinny frame.
      He’d been given the part of the court jester, Trinculo, who
    forms part of an absurd conspiracy with Caliban and Stephano to
    take over the island. Jeffrey, the weight lifter, would play Caliban.
    Nu had cast Cal as Ferdinand, the young lover of Miranda. And
    Francisco was given the part of Prospero.
      Inside the Drama Building, the girls had gathered, talking over
    the casting. The social groupings around the theater still generally
     fell along gender lines. Windy Donne, who had large beautiful
    eyes and long hair, had been given the role of Miranda. Ariel, the
     spirit, was given to Sharan Lowenthal, a musically gifted student
    who could sing and play the flute. Girls were also cast as figures in
    the masque, Iris, Ceres, Juno, the reapers, the nymphs.
     Carter walked to the bulletin board outside Nu’s office. He
    wanted to see the cast list posted, just to be certain. It was a single
    sheet of paper, with the word Players centered at the top. And there
    was his name, the tenth down, opposite Trinculo.
     The girls nodded to him and went back to talking. He didn’t see
    Blossom Haven’s name anywhere on the cast list, but he knew she
    would be working tech. He could tell Nu was in her office because
    he smelled the fresh and strong espresso, and he wanted to see her.
    He wanted to thank her, but more, he wanted to hear her praise
    him further, hear in her voice how he deserved the role.

```

```
    “She likes to just be left alone after she casts a play,” Windy said
   in a low voice. “You can’t blame her. Too many hurt egos.”
    Carter went back outside, to where the boys were gathered.
  They were loud and raucous, shouting out lines from the play and
   improvising. When one spoke, another would cry, This is a scurvy
   tune! Prospero’s line You'd be king o’ the isle, sirrah? was revised to
   You'd be king o’ the Drama Building, sirrah? or You'd be king o’ the
   high school, sirrah?
    Carter sat with them and laughed, but he didn’t join in. They
  were already a group, and every jibe and joke reinforced their
  membership in the group. They had a history together Carter
   didn’t yet share. He thought he might, through the course of the
   play, grow comfortable with them and be one of the jokers and
   laughers, but he felt safer holding back, observing, waiting for a
   cue from them before joining in.
    After being cast, he kept his shirt buttoned, so that nobody
  could see the slogan. He was happy and didn’t want anyone to ruin
   it. Nobody had deliberately shouldered into him in the plaza, or hit
  him, and he hadn’t run into K. J. again. But he still had the walk
  home, along the same route, and the glow of having been given a
   part, and being recognized as a player, suddenly lessened.
    He looked for the purple Tiburon as he set out. When he didn’t
   see it, he unbuttoned his shirt. He walked on the left-hand side of the
   street, so that a car couldn’t cruise up behind him, but he still kept
  glancing over his shoulder. He didn’t pay any attention to the Plym-
  outh Fury that drove past him once, circled around, and then parked
  ahead of him at the corner of Prospector and Saratoga Avenue.
    In the days since Katherine drove him from the house, Scott
  brooded in the El Rancho Motel. As she was chasing him out, she
  was yelling at him what he should do. He should call her, like any
  normal person would do, they should meet and talk, he should get
  back in contact with his son and daughter.
    Scott had been paid off his ship almost a month ago. He still
  had a month before the Military [Sealift ] [Command ] [would ] [want ] [him ]

```

-----

```
    home, and he began to cruise around the high school when classes
    ended, hoping to find his son. He thought he could talk to him. He
    thought Carter would appreciate that he’d gone to help with the
    war effort, even though Katherine hadn’t.
      In truth, the role Scott played at sea was little changed from the
    work he’d done in 1979 during the Iranian hostage crisis. He again
    sailed on a fleet oiler, a ship that refueled navy ships at sea. Every
    few days, near sunset, an aircraft carrier pulled alongside the oiler,
    and they steamed together on parallel courses a hundred feet apart.
    The carrier shot projectiles with light nylon cord attached over the
    deck of the oiler. The cords were then bent to lines that carried
    heavy cables from the oiler back to the carrier. The cables were
    put under tension by massive hydraulic rams, and then large hoses
    were sent across via the cables, and fuel was pumped. At dawn
    the carrier broke away smoothly and picked up speed, leaving the
    slow, wide oiler in its wake.
      Scott worked under a rig captain at the number-three rig. He
    faked out line that would carry the cable across, manned the
    sound-powered phones that put the rig in direct communication
    with the carrier, helped at the windlass that brought the lines back,
    and secured the rig. There was no adventure to it. The rig cap-
    tain didn’t want adventure. He wanted to follow the procedure, to
    make refueling as routine as possible, just another part of the job.
      Scott wasn’t planning on telling his son just how menial his role
    really was and how far he’d been from any real danger. He didn’t see
    any reasons to get into details when he first saw him. He’d been near
     Iraq, and he thought Carter should appreciate that much, anyway.
     On the third day of cruising between the high school and the
    subdivision, Scott spied Carter walking down Prospector Street.
    His son looked taller and even thinner than when he’d left, walk-
    ing with a nylon messenger bag slung over one shoulder, walk-
    ing a little hunched as though he were afraid of something. Scott
    thought that he’d have to get Carter going on some weight train-
     ing, to get him to stand up straight and muscle up. Maybe some

```

-----

```
    He looked down critically at his own gut. Not bad, but not great.
   The physical work he’d done at sea hadn’t been nearly enough
   to make up for the bacon and cheese omelets for breakfast, spa-
   ghetti for lunch, beef or pork with gravy for dinner that the ship’s
   cooks laid out every day, the heavy and filling food that the crew
   demanded. Some of the young guys, twenty years younger than
   him, had been able to work on deck all day and then go down
   to the ship’s small weight room and pump the weight machines.
   Scott found himself in that middle age, young enough to think still
   about working out and sculpting his body, but feeling an indefin-
   able heaviness at the end of every day that kept him seated and
   reading the paperbacks handed back and forth among the crew.
    He took the Fury around and parked it near the corner of Pros-
   pector and Saratoga, and he watched Carter walking toward him
   on the sidewalk, about a hundred yards away. He wished he had a
   better car. He wished he had a new Mustang convertible, red with a
   black ragtop, something that would say clearly that he was a father
   who was successful now, not the father who had lost everything.
   As Carter approached, he sucked in his belly and opened the door.
    He had imagined opening his arms, sharing a hug with his son,
   almost man-to-man now. But as he stood up, and Carter stopped in
   shock, he read the message on the T-shirt.
    “Why are you wearing that shirt?”
     Scott might have understood, if he had reflected, that this was
   not the best way to say hello to his son.
    “Dad?” Carter stared. His father seemed to have sprung like a
   jack-in-the-box from an old beater car and was standing in his way,
   black Ray Bans covering his eyes.
    “That shirt. They let you wear that to school?”
    “What?”
    “They shouldn’t. It’s disrespectful. Did you see a counselor? You
   should have seen a counselor. I know what a counselor would say.
   He’d say it’s disrespectful.”
    “Dad, where did you come from?”

```

-----

```
     “She doesn’t want you to know. That figures. She doesn’t want
   me to come and straighten things out. Look at you. Do you think
    you’re accomplishing anything by wearing that shirt? I can answer
    that for you. No. You’re not accomplishing anything by wearing
    that shirt.”
     “I accomplish things,’ Carter said. He was thinking about the
    part in the play, but he decided not to mention it. He decided his
    father would just shit on it.
     “D’ve been in Iraq,” Scott said. Not technically true, but true
    in spirit. “How do you think [it ]makes [me ] [feel ] [to ] [come ] [back ] [and ]
    see my son wearing that? Did [you ] [think ] [of ][that? ] [Did ] [you ] [think ]
    of me?”
     “But you weren’t here.”
     “So if I’m not here, I don’t matter? I was in Iraq!”
     “I don’t care where you were,” Carter said. “You weren’t here.”
     “Well, I’m here now.”
     “Well, thanks for nothing.”
     Carter noticed the purple Tiburon cruise past them as he spoke.
    Stares. A pointed finger. Then the Tiburon turned and disappeared
   down Saratoga Avenue. He had forgotten about them. Now he
   wondered if talking with his father had held him up just enough
    for them to spot him.
     “’ve got to get home,” he said.
     “Vl give you a ride,” Scott said. “Hop in.”
     Carter hesitated. A ride would keep him safe for today. But he
    didn’t want his father to show up from nowhere and become his
    protector. He felt better not depending on his father.
     “No thanks, Dad. I’d rather walk.”
     “Wait.” Scott reached for his wallet and pulled out two
    hundred-dollar bills and held them toward Carter. “Here. Some-
    thing for now. You need some walking-around money, don’t you?”
     Again, Carter hesitated. In truth, even though his father had
    been blustering, Carter understood he had a choice in how much
    to let him in. And he saw neediness in the way his father reached

```

-----

```
    He took the bills and folded them up and put them in his shirt
   pocket. His father pulled a book of matches out of his pocket.
   “Here. This is where I’m staying.”
     Carter looked at the matchbook. On the cover was a line draw-
   ing of the El Rancho Motel and its address and phone number.
     “Okay,” he said.
     Scott smiled as Carter walked down Prospector. “I’m back,” he
    called after him. He watched until his son had turned on to the
   commercial strip of Saratoga Avenue, then got into his Fury. The
   engine sounded huge as he turned it on. He waited for a moment
   and then turned to shadow his son back to the subdivision.
     Scott felt like a failure most of the time. He could never stop
   comparing himself to others his age or younger who had gotten
   more than him, who had risen up to some level of success and
    ease that was always just out of his reach. He used the phrase “Got
    it made” with deep envy and resentment. Speaking of someone
    else, he would say, “Well, he’s got it made” or “He’s got his ticket
   punched,” and mean that the other person was really undeserving
   and there was or must be something crooked behind it all. At the
   very least, those others were no more deserving than himself.
     His sister in particular drove him crazy. She had graduated from
   Chico State two years after him with a degree in English, while
   he had slaved away at engineering. After college, she had taken
   some time off, to have kids, and let her husband, a high school
    teacher, support them. Then she began selling cosmetics for Mary
   Kay, and found she had a knack for it, and was soon the regional
    sales leader. She was making twice what Scott had ever made, lived
   in a beautiful house in Gilroy [with ] [a ] [pool ] [and ] [a ] [hot ] [tub ] [in ] [the ]
   backyard, still married [to ] [her ] [dopey ] [husband ] [even ] [though ] [his ] [sal- ]
   ary was pathetic. While Scott [was ] [getting ] [laid ] [off, ] [she ] [was ] [getting ]
   bonuses.
     Scott’s mother lived in Las Vegas with another guy who had
    it made, married him only three months after meeting him. He
   ran self-actualization seminars, designed to help people create

```

-----

```
    a few individual clients, poker players competing in the big tourna-
    ments, who paid him thousands of dollars. He guessed his mother
   had it made too, since she married somebody rolling in dough.
     Even when he’d had a job, he always felt like he was just
   keeping up, never really breaking [free ] [of ][the ] [crowd. ] [Trading ] [up ]
    in houses was a mistake, but he [had ] [convinced ] [himself ] [that ] [they ]
    deserved it, that being surrounded by all that success would make
   them a success as well. And that first mistake led to his investment
    mistakes, each mistake an attempt to make up for the previous
    one, each mistake one more lunge at having it made, at getting his
   own ticket punched.
     On good days, he could talk himself into believing that shipping
    out and doing the same job he’d done when he was twenty-three
    was a good thing. He could tell himself that he was part of some-
    thing larger than just himself, part of a great national mission. He
    could forget the wearing physical labor, the eighty-hour work-
   weeks out at sea, the deep fatigue he felt that he hadn’t felt in 1979.
   On bad days, he wondered what he was going to do next, whether
    shipping out again in December was as good as it was going to get.
     If Katherine and Carter had admired what he’d done, it would
    be easier not to feel like such a loser. He had already thought about
    Henry’s house, how many hundreds of thousands of dollars it
    must be worth, what kind of a home equity loan it could bring,
   what they could do with that money. Maybe tear down the house
    and build a palace that his sister would envy.
     All impossible, unless he got Katherine back.
     He decided, on balance, that this was a good day, despite the
    antiwar T-shirt he’d found Carter wearing. Carter had taken the
    money, after all. He would use it for himself. He would start to
    think well of the old man. And that would be an opening. He won-
    dered what it would be like if he really stayed on as an able sea-
    man. With a snug house waiting for him between ships, a loving
    Katherine welcoming him back from the sea, and being pampered
    and cherished and fussed over, like the Gloucester fishermen in

```

```
    He cruised slowly down Prospector Street until he caught sight
   of Carter, the thin frame, the light curly hair. Carter was walking
   against the traffic, in front of the strip malls, and Scott watched
   him across four lanes of traffic, with a large center-divide island
   separating the two streams of cars. When he drew a little ahead,
   he pulled the Fury into a McDonald’s parking lot and watched his
   son walk.
    From a distance, he saw three boys emerge from a purple car in
    a parking lot and step onto the sidewalk in front of his son. He saw
   Carter hesitate. Two of the boys were big, but a shorter kid wearing
    a leather jacket was doing the talking, hyped up, dancing around,
   almost jumping. Carter was talking back to them, it seemed, but
   Scott could see that this was some kind of confrontation.
     Carter tried to walk forward, but the two big boys blocked his
   path. He tried to walk around them. He didn’t break into a run or
   try to dodge them. Scott was cheered, seeing his son’s maturity,
   seeing him not act like a scared kid.
    Then leather jacket said something, and the two big boys rushed
   Carter, picked him up under the shoulders, and pushed him back-
   ward into a Dumpster. They laughed and ran back to the purple
    car. Carter pushed himself out and brushed himself off.
     Scott turned the key on the Fury, and the V8 engine roared as he
   backed up and then pulled out of the parking lot into traffic. The
   purple car was already heading in the opposite direction, and Scott
   pulled into the left lane and cranked his wheel left and bounced
   his car over the traffic island, fishtailing across two lanes before
   straightening out and accelerating.
    The purple car was a long block and a half ahead of him. He
   saw it pass under a traffic light, [not ] [moving ] [much ] [above ] [the ] [speed ]
   limit, and he stepped on [the ] [gas ] [to ] [beat ] [the ] [light. ] [It ][turned ] [yellow ]
   just as he entered the intersection. [Ahead, ] [he ] [saw ] [the ] [purple ] [car ]
   turn right, off the commercial [strip, ] [into ] [a ][residential ] [section. ]
     Scott turned the Fury after the car, but didn’t see it ahead of
   him. The streets in this subdivision were a perfect grid, all straight

```

-----

```
    of a thousand square feet or less. Scott slowed his car and cruised
    past the first block, looking left or right. Nothing.
     He let the Fury idle forward. The houses here were all nearly
    identical, with picture windows and one-car garages and a front
    door withdrawn behind a square of lawn and some shrubs. The
    grid of streets had created a kind of uniformity, so that no place
    was distinct from any other place.
     He thought, for the purple car to have disappeared so quickly,
    that it must have turned at the second or third block. He followed
    a hunch and turned left at the third block, and he sped past the
    houses, pausing at each intersection to look both ways.
     He spotted the car after five minutes. It was stopped in front of
    a house on a street to the right, and one of the big boys had gotten
    out and was standing beside it. The car took off before he caught
    up with it, and he began to follow it. There were two boys in the
    car now, and Scott could see their heads going back and forth,
    talking. The boy in the passenger seat turned and looked at Scott,
    then turned back and said something to the boy driving.
     The purple car turned right. Scott turned the Fury right, fol-
    lowing. The purple car turned left at the next block. Scott turned
    left. The houses they passed were all the same stucco, painted
    blue and green and red, with ficus or jacaranda trees in the front
    strip, sometimes some shrubs under the picture windows, some-
    times with shiny Astroturf replacing the front lawn beside the
    driveway.
     The purple car sped up, going to forty miles an hour through
    the residential streets. Scott accelerated to keep up with them.
     The car turned left, skidding its tires. Scott had to slow down to
    make the turn with his big boat of a car.
     He found the purple car stopped in the middle of the street,
    halfway down the block. As he pulled up, the kid in the oversize
    leather jacket got out of the driver’s side of the car.
     The kid stood there, thin with black jeans, his legs spread. Maybe
    seventeen years old, his face sneering and creased with acne.

```

-----

```
    “Hey, asshole.”
     Scott stepped on the accelerator. The car leaped at the leather
   jacket.
    “Hey!” The kid dove to his left.
     Scott felt the bump as one fender clipped the kid’s legs and spun
   him around.
    He kept driving. In his rearview mirror, he saw the kid on the
   ground, his friend out of the purple car and kneeling beside him.
    He turned right and sped up. If he kept going, he thought, he
   would come to another edge of this grid and break free.

   KATHERINE HAD WORKED for BPI, Batch Processing, Inc., for
    twelve years. The company specialized in software that analyzed
    batch manufacturing—any process that took raw material at one
    end and created a finished product or products at the other end.
    Crude oil cracked and refined into gasoline and other products was
     a batch process. Raw whole grains milled and ground and baked
    into cornflakes was another batch process. Bpi’s software could
    retrieve and record data at many stages of the process, to find
    problems that were cropping up and to uncover hidden inefficien-
    cies that could be addressed. In the past few years, srr had made it
    possible to view data on any process in real time on the Internet, so
    that the functioning of many plants anywhere in the world could
    be supervised from one location.
     The chemical engineers strolled the carpeted halls in khakis
    and golf shirts, badges dangling from their belt loops, relatively
    normal. The programmers were more eccentric. One programmer
    kept a large rock on his desk next to his computer. He said that
    when he felt stuck, he looked at the rock and said, “The rock is
    doing its job. Now you do yours.” Another programmer, Ron New-
    bury, once brought a pet sugar glider to work one day in a canvas
    bag he kept hanging around his neck. He claimed that the animal
    had to get used to his smell. At lunchtime, when he opened the
    bag to show everyone, a small mammal with large liquid eyes and
    stripes down its back leaped onto the desk. Ron lifted it onto his
    shirt and began to stroke it, and it peed.
     Katherine was neither engineer nor programmer. She had the
     title of events planner, and she was in charge of organizing the
    annual users’ conference for spi clients, held every March in Mon-
    terey. Her year usually had a lull in April and May, then grew
    steadily busier as she distributed publicity by emails, met with sales

```

```
   presentations, with the cro and the vice presidents about plenary
   sessions. She had to arrange food services and entertainment, and
   a few favored clients were always comped at Pebble Beach Golf
   Links.
    She worked in a broad, U-shaped desk space that she shared
   with two others employees, Rajni Thekkiam, a twenty-five-year-old
   from Bangalore, and Heber Grimshaw, a little older than thirty,
   who kept his hair short and neatly parted and wore a suit and tie to
   work every day except on casual Fridays.
    Katherine compared herself to Rajni and wished she could eat
   the way Rajni did and not gain weight. She envied the way her
   coworker always had matching accessories, scarves that went per-
   fectly with her blouse and her greenish eyes, and pendants and
   earrings that tied every ensemble together. Her own clothing
   choices always seemed less coordinated, drabber, older. But she
   liked talking with Rajni about hair, and purses, and shoes. Rajni
   always seemed to know where there were great bargains to be
   had, special clearance sales, early-bird pricing, consignment shops
   with designer clothes. And even though Katherine never had time
   to run out to the places Rajni mentioned, she liked talking about
   them. It made her feel that she was not really in a different age and
   different time of life, that she hadn’t really changed much since her
   early thirties.
    Sometimes, Katherine fantasized that if she had never married
   Scott, she would still be twenty-five. [It ][was ] [that ] [decision ] [that ] [had ]
   made her age, and if she hadn’t made [it, ][she ][would ] [still ][be ][the ] [same ]
   age as Rajni, an age of infinite [possibilities. ] [She ] [would ] [be ][making ]
   decisions about nothing of [consequence, ] [and ] [her ] [life ] [would ] [be ] [as ]
   light as tiramisu after [an ] [Italian ] [dinner, ] [light ] [as ] [a ] [new ] [handbag ]
   at the mall, light as an [initial ] [email ] [sent ] [through ][a ][dating ] [service. ]
   Then she thought about [Betty ] [and ] [Carter, ] [Carter’s ] [curly ] [hair ] [that ]
   haloed his pale face [and ] [Betty’s ] [sardonic ] [remarks ] [that ] [Katherine ]
   couldn’t live without, [and ] [she ][would ] [feel ] [guilty ][for ][imagining ] [them ]
   absent from the world.

    because they worked so close together, but that she’d heard from
    other women. He would date them, but at some point, he’d just
    draw back. It might be because he was raised a Mormon, and so he
     didn’t really know how to be around women, but she wondered if
    he was really gay and didn’t know it, like that character in Angels in
    America. He was a Mormon too.
     Heber’s job, which he was coordinating with Katherine, was
    developing webinars, seminars on the systems-control software
    that could be offered on the Web. His job required him to know
    much more about programming than Katherine, and she won-
    dered if he wasn’t eventually going to make her job obsolete, if
    someday there would be no need for companies to send employ-
     ees to Monterey once a year for training and presentations, if it
    would all be done online. Already, in the past two years, she had
    noticed the number of conference attendees level off, even though
    the number of companies using the software had increased. She
    wondered if she would end up working under Heber someday.
     The fact that she’d had to take a vacation day every three weeks
     to get her father to chemo had been noticed, and it would be
    noticed more just before the users’ conference. Even though she
    was not taking any other kind of vacation, her boss, whom they
    called the Colonel, had made a note in her personnel file that too
    many “personal days” could begin to affect employee performance.
    They called him the Colonel only behind his back. He had been a
    career army officer, but in fact had only made lieutenant colonel
    and had to retire when he was passed over for promotion. Some
    of his demand for efficiency, Katherine and Rajni thought, was
    because he was compensating for the fact he’d never made general.
     Heber had been able to cover for her several times while she
      _ was with her father, since he helped on the users’ conference
    during crunch time, and she was grateful for that, even while she
     felt somewhat threatened by him. She thought that her company
    was still sexist—go percent of the programmers were men, and
     all the founders were men—and she was afraid that if the position

    as nice as Heber seemed, Boy Scout nice, she didn’t want to let him
   take over her responsibilities any more than necessary.
   After work that day, unaware that Scott had tracked down Car-
   ter, she pulled into her father’s driveway—her driveway too, she
   declared to herself—and stayed in her car. There was something
   comforting and cradling about that driver’s seat, that place where
   she sat and nobody else ever did, despite the Saturn’s oil leak. It
   was a place that had stayed with her, that she had been able to
   depend on for the past ten years.
    She began to talk to her mother, as she did from time to time.
   She told her mother that she wasn’t completely secure in her job,
   Scott had been laid off, she could be too, and then where would
   they be? She asked her what she thought of having Carter take
   Dad to chemo. Carter had his learner’s permit, and he could drive
   accompanied by her father, and she didn’t think it mattered if her
   father was weakened by the chemo on the way back. It might be
   good for Carter. He could feel responsible, more grown up, he
   could feel she trusted him. As she talked to her mother, she grad-
   ually began playing in her head the conversation she would have
   with Carter. She would present it as a favor he could do for her, as
   a concrete way to help his grandfather. He would understand what
   she was asking and feel proud to be able to help. He would begin
    to mope less, and be less moody, [and ] [help ] [around ] [the ] [house. ] [He ]
   would become a model son!
    Her mother never really answered Katherine. She had died so
   suddenly, at a time when [Katherine ] [was ] [acting ] [sullen ] [and ] [with- ]
   drawn, thinking that [she ] [had ] [nothing ] [to ] [learn ] [from ] [her. ] [Katherine ]
   had missed out on maturing [and ][learning ] [to ] [appreciate ] [her ][mother, ]
   missed out on drawing [closer ] [to ] [her ][when ] [she ] [went ] [to ] [college, ] [got ]
   married, had children. [There ] [was ] [no ] [fund ] [of ][experience ] [and ] [good ]
   advice that Katherine [could ] [remember ] [and ] [draw ] [on ] [to ] [bring ] [her ]
   own distant children close again.

    mother had said haunted her—Youw’ll do better than me. She’d said
     it once in passing, a thing parents say reflexively to their children,
    but it came back to Katherine now that she was again living with
    her father. How had she done better?
      She opened the back door of the Saturn and grabbed a card-
    board file box filled with demo cps and résumés of some possible
    entertainers for the conference, and she walked to the front door.
     “By God.” Katherine heard her father’s voice boom when she
    walked in the door. “By God, who is that coming in?”
      “Stay put, Dad, I’ll come over.”
     But Henry had already stood up from his desk in the sunken
    den, shambling toward her like a friendly bear, walking tenderly in
    oversize slippers that eased the spiked pain in the soles of his feet.
    He was still a big man, even shrunken from cancer, and he took
    Katherine in his arms and hugged her. Then he let her loose and
    looked at her.
      “You're losing too much weight,” he said. “Your growth is
     stunted. You need to have more sex, girl, if you’re to survive at all.”
     Katherine knew her part to play in this. She tapped his arm,
     as though embarrassed. “You didn’t follow your own advice. You
    didn’t remarry after Mom.”
     “And look at me,” he said. “It’s a wonder I’ve survived the last
    thirty years.”
     “You're surviving,” Katherine said. She walked over to the
    kitchen and opened the refrigerator door and stared at the bright
    space. For a moment, she couldn’t remember why she had opened
    the refrigerator. The shelves were full of labeled jars and bottles
    and foods shrouded in plastic bags or Tupperware, but she couldn’t
    think why she was looking or what she was looking for. Then she
    thought of dinner and stared again at the shelves, but nothing came
     to her. She gaped at the shelves full of food, thinking something
    must be there for a dinner. She would be perfectly happy with a
    bowl of cereal, and everyone else ought to be as well. A bowl of
    cereal, or nothing. Just announce we’re having nothing for dinner.

   the street.
    “Tl treat us to takeout tonight,” he said, as though he could
   read her mind.
    “Lord be praised.”
    Katherine closed the door of the refrigerator and leaned back
   against it, as though shutting the cover of an unpleasant book.
      “TI wanted to talk to you before I asked Carter, Dad. What do
   you think if he took you to chemo? You could drive there, and he
   could drive you back. It would be a big help to me.”
    “Good by me,” Henry said.
     “Is Carter home?”
     “Sort of.”
    “What’s that mean?”
     “It means he came home and went into his room and shut the
   door,” Henry said.
    “Any reason?”
    “Nothing he wanted to share with his grandfather.”
     “I wonder if he didn’t get a part in that play.”
    “Maybe not.”
    Katherine sighed. “I wanted that for him.”
    “Maybe you should tell him you’ve seen Scott.”
    “What good would that do?”
     “If he knew his father was acting like a nutcase,” Henry said,
   “he might be easier on you.”
    Katherine squeezed her father’s arm, then walked through the liv-
   ing room to the hall that led to the bedrooms. The door to Carter’s
   room was a blank face. She walked up to it, thought about knocking,
   decided against it. He would come out soon enough, and she didn’t
   want him to come out already armored with resentment. She touched
   her fingers to the wood of the hollow door, as though she would be
   able to feel the warm heart of her son through the door. Then she
   went back to the dining room, hoisted her file box to the table.
    While his mother leaned toward the door, Carter was talking
   quietly on his cell phone to Betty in Aptos. He had never been very

    happy at least that she never had to be in high school with him.
    And she was a rule breaker, always willing to try something new
    for the experience, and he was a goody-goody in her mind. But he
    didn’t know whom else to call about seeing their father.
     She told him that she hadn’t seen him yet, though it was proba-
    bly only a matter of time before he tracked her down.
     “God, that will be great. pap will show up at the restaurant where
    I’m working and want to have a heart-to-heart. As though we ever
    talked before he lost all the money and bailed. Know what ’ll tell
    him if he shows up?”
     “What?” Carter was talking while lying on top of his bed, with
    his knees tucked up and the phone cradled by his head.
     “<Sorry, Dad. I’m busy peeling shrimp.’ Does Mom know
    he’s here?”
      “I don’t know.”
     “So what did he want?”
      “T don’t know that either. He started yelling at me. And then he
    gave me two hundred dollars.”
     Betty hooted. “That’s Dad. Great with the interpersonal rela-
    tionships. What did he yell at you about?”
     “What my shirt said.”
     “What did it say?”
     Carter told her.
     “Really? And he saw it?” A note of respect came into her voice.
    “That’s awesome.”
     “He said it was disrespectful.”
     Betty snorted. “Look, it’s obvious he’s trying to buy back your
    love. It’s because he knows how much he fucked everything up.”
     “So should I keep the money?” Carter uncurled from the bed
    and sat up.
     “What, are you crazy? Does this run in the family? or coursE
    keep the money. Just because he gave it to you doesn’t mean he’s
    bought anything.”
     “Maybe I should give it to Mom.”

```

```
   like I did. And the more money you can stash away, the better. Two
   hundred bucks is nothing.”
    “Okay.”
    “Remember what I told you. Escape or die.”
     “Right.”
    “What kind of car was Dad driving? I want to be able to spot it.”
    “One of those old boats with a vinyl roof? Green, with black
   vinyl. But the vinyl was peeling, and you could see the metal start-
   ing to rust underneath it.”
    “God, what a loser.”
     After they hung up, Carter logged on to his computer to see if
   anyone had messaged him. Nobody had. He felt very alone. He
   had thought, for a second, of telling Betty about the boys who had
   jumped him again, after she seemed impressed by his wearing the
    shirt. But she might think that the vow he made was just stupid.
   She was good at making him feel stupid and making him feel that
   whatever happened to him was because he just wasn’t savvy about
   the world.
    He couldn’t tell her, or the boys at school who were starting to
   act friendly. He couldn’t tell his mother or grandfather.
    He looked at the computer screen again, screen-save mode now,
   with nature scenes fading in and out. There was no one in that box
   he could tell.
    He didn’t want to tell his mother the good news, either, about
   getting a part in the play. He could let her know that his life was
   harder now than it had been before, but he didn’t want to allow her
   to think that his life was getting better. In his opinion, it wasn’t.
    He walked out of his room and into the hallway. The house was
   so small that any movement [out ] [of ][his ] [room ] [immediately ] [put ] [him ]
   into his mother’s sphere, and [he ] [now ] [spent ] [more ] [time ] [with ] [the ]
   door closed than he ever had [in ][their ] [house ] [in ][Oak ] [Commons. ] [He ]
   found his mother at the dining [room ] [table ] [with ] [some ] [papers ] [from ]
   the cardboard file box spread [out. ] [Maybe ] [his ] [sister ] [was ] [right. ] [She ]
   did look clueless. A [pair ] [of ][reading ] [glasses ] [was ] [sliding ] [down ] [her ]

      After a moment, she looked up. “Hi, sweetie,” she said.
     He looked at her without speaking.
     She glanced at the kitchen, suddenly feeling guilty. But why
    should she? Why couldn’t she just say that nothing was for dinner?
     “Grandpa is going to pick up something at the Pho Garden for
    us,” she said. “Does that sound good?”
      “Sure.”
     “Here. Have a seat.” She cleared away several stacks of file fold-
    ers and patted the chair beside her.
     Carter sat down, stiff and unwilling.
      “I wanted to tell you,” she said. “I saw your father a few days ago.”
      Carter’s first impulse was to tell her that he’d seen his father
    too, that afternoon, and that he’d already been belittled by him.
    And then he’d been thrown into a Dumpster again. But he heard
    Betty saying that their mother was clueless, and he decided to keep
     it all to himself.
     “How is he?” he asked.
     “Well ... he hasn’t quite gotten settled,” Katherine said. “He
     still feels in between things. I think he’d like to be here, with us.
    But I don’t think that’s a good idea. Right now.”
     “No. It’s not a good idea,” Carter said.
     “But it makes things hard on me, not having him around. And
    that’s where you can be a big help.”
     “How?”
      “It’s getting hard for me to take time off of work to take your
    grandfather to chemo,” she said. “So I was wondering if you could
    go with him. He could drive there, and you could drive back. It
    would be like an extra driving lesson for you.”
     Carter thought Betty would approve of how he was handling
    the situation. This offer took him by surprise, and he liked it. He
    liked anything that let him drive more often. But he wasn’t ready
     to show it. Better to make it seem like some favor he was doing
    for her.
     “Will I have to miss school?” he asked.

    it to her now as something that made his time important, that
   made her request more of a burden.
     “No, I didn’t know that.” Katherine brightened. “Will taking
   your grandpa be too much?”
     “No. I don’t think so, The rehearsals are at night. I might need a
    ride sometimes, though, since I can’t drive myself yet.”
     “Of course,” she said. “I can always take you.”
                                                     2 @eee
   Two days later, Henry Watson, Pearl Harbor survivor aboard the
    uss Phoenix and veteran of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, walked down
    the hallway from the master bedroom, dressed in a green terry-
    cloth bathrobe and flannel pajamas. In the kitchen, he poured
   himself a cup of coffee from the half-empty pot his daughter had
    left for him. Eight a.m. He rolled back down the hall and paused
    in front of Carter’s door. When he heard no sound of stirring, he
   pounded the door with a fist.
    “Now reveille, reveille, reveille. Heave out and trice up. Drop
   your cocks and grab your socks. The uniform of the day is dress
   blues. Inspection at Oh Nine Hundred Hours. Now reveille.”
    He took his coffee back to the kitchen and added a teaspoon of
    sugar. He used to drink coffee black, but he found as he grew older
   that it tasted better with a little sweetness added. He sipped it and
   looked out the kitchen window to the street where he had lived the
   past five decades, the same landscape, tiny and familiar. He sipped
   his coffee. Another chemo day.
    Henry was diagnosed in 1998 and by 2003 was a medical mir-
    acle. It was only because he was in fine health that they used an
   aggressive regimen to try [to ] [stop ] [the ] [cancer. ] [He ] [had ] [his ] [prostate ]
   removed, and his testicles [taken, ] [and ] [chemotherapy. ] [He ] [was ] [a ]
   large man, six foot three and [two ] [hundred ] [solid ] [pounds, ] [but ][he ][felt ]
   his whole body slacken from [the ] [cancer ] [and ] [the ] [chemicals ] [and ] [the ]
   hormones. His shoulders grew [thinner, ] [and ] [he ][grew ] [more ] [of ][a ] [gut ]
   and a sag of flesh under his chin.

    usually went to the bones first. He went back on chemo to shrink
    the new lesions, and a surgeon burned them off and told him he
    was cancer free, but he never really believed it, and the lesions
    came back. After a different regimen of chemotherapy, the lesions
    shrunk to nondetectable size, but when he was taken off chemo
    again, the dark spots returned to his scan, numerous and deadly.
     Then he began chemotherapy just to be able to live with his
    cancer, not to cure it. His oncologist had no idea how long it would
    last. He was an ongoing experiment. Every third week, they poured
    poison into him through a shunt near his heart, putting him flat on
    his back for days. At first, he could eat nothing. After a day, potato
    soup was the only thing that tasted good to him. Then he was able
    to eat some white chicken. Gradually, he rose from the dead and
    was able to walk, think, laugh, until the next round. Every three
    weeks, another near-death experience and another resurrection.
     Year by year, Henry felt his grasp of the visible world slipping.
    The tidy house, his Peaceable Isle, had gradually gotten away from
    him. He no longer had the strength to clear gutters, trim shrub-
    bery, paint, fix, maintain. It was all deteriorating, and he couldn’t
    raise his hands and bring it back into order. He cherished the
    return of his daughter, but she brought sorrow and longing with
    her, beyond his powers. And he could not legislate his grandson’s
    chaotic feelings into happiness, despite trying to do things with
    him that he hadn’t with his two sons. His chemotherapy every
    three weeks gave him at best a tenuous control over his own body,
    and he felt at any treatment the cancer could escape, erupt into
    something winged and clawed. He knew what the next step would
    be if this regimen failed. Some new and harsher treatment that
    poisoned him like a rat and might not work and then abandoning
    therapy for a few gorgeous months of good feeling before failing
    utterly.
     He heard Carter moving about, heard the hollow bedroom door
    open and the bathroom door close as his grandson scurried across
    the hall to take a shower. Before his treatment, they were going

    Spot. They told him he should talk to kids about what Pearl Harbor
   was like. There weren’t that many survivors around anymore, and
    if he didn’t share his stories, they’d be forgotten. His two friends
   had been going to schools and talking about their time in the war
    for years, but requests had gone way up since 9/11.
    Henry wasn’t one of those who talked about his time at war as
    the greatest adventure of his life. Sometimes, he felt as though he
   had lived his life inside of a dream, though he was not the dreamer.
   The war was waiting for him at the end of childhood, the child-
    ish games he had thoughtlessly played grown into monstrous real-
    ity. And he had walked from his life at war into his life postwar
    with little reflection, as if he were not truly the agent of his actions,
    but only a figure moved in concert with millions of others, moved
   within the obscure designs of some larger dream. The family wait-
   ing for him, the landscape of homes waiting for him, it wasn’t some-
    thing he himself had created. He sometimes was aware of being in
    a dream, as the mind of a dreamer is sometimes aware, but he could
    not move completely outside of the dream, to glimpse it whole.
     Henry had a cousin his own age, a Lutheran minister, an author
    of some note, who wrote in a book that the contentments of family
    were a foretaste of heaven. But his cousin had never married, and
   Henry himself could never accept the simple answer that he was
    living inside the design of God, not after the many and anonymous
    deaths of the war, not after the singular and intimate death of his
   Mary Katherine.
    Henry had never talked about Pearl Harbor with any of his
   grandchildren. It wasn’t one [of ][the ] [medley ] [of ][family ] [stories ] [that ]
   were passed around and repeated [over ] [and ] [over, ] [their ] [repetition ]
   forming part of the identity [they ] [shared. ] [But ] [now, ] [he ] [hoped ] [that ]
    if Carter heard him talk [to ] [the ] [schoolkids ] [about ] [the ][war, ] [he ][might ]
    grasp some plausible [narrative ] [of ][his ] [family’s ] [past, ] [an ] [appreciation ]
   of the house where they [were ] [all ] [living, ] [that ] [might ] [lead ] [him ] [to ]
    soften his resentment. [A ] [story ] [Carter ] [could ] [believe ] [in, ] [even ] [reat ]
   was one that Henry [himself ] [found ] [lacking. ]

   where he tied a bright colored scarf. When he agreed to give the
    talk, he looked over the clothes he used to wear to work. None
    of them fit. He had gained weight, softened and fallen, because
    of the cancer and the surgery and the hormonal treatment that
    followed. When he went to Mosher’s, a men’s store where he’d
    been buying clothes since the fifties, he joked with the salesman
    that what he really needed was a training bra. They shared a sym-
    pathetic laugh, and the salesman found him a constructed coat
    with enough of a shoulder pad to give him back some of his outer
    shape.
     He still wore a beret. He thought without it, he looked like a
    turkey buzzard, bald head perching on a bald neck, no eyebrows,
    no eyelashes, just slack naked skin, mottled with spots. The scarf
    and the beret were a defense against the signs of his condition, an
    attempt to control at least how others saw him, though futile, he
    knew, against the condition itself.
     Midmorning, Carter drove the Buick under Henry’s direction
    into the parking lot of the James D. Phelan Elementary School, a
    public school located near the new and prosperous developments
    financed by dot-com money that curled into the foothills above
    Cupertino and Los Altos. The lines of parking places beside the
    school were separated by thin strips of dirt and grass rimmed by
    cement curbs and punctuated by spindly young trees held straight
   by wooden stakes and rubber hose. Carter bumped the left tire gen-
    tly against the curb, put the car in park, set the brake, and turned
    off the ignition, while Henry nodded at each step. Carter wore his
    normal school jeans and a sweatshirt—he wanted to show he was
    not making any special effort.
     They walked through doors of heavy glass framed by thick metal
    and entered a bright, open atrium. The principal had his secretary
    watching, and when he heard that his guest had arrived, he rose
    and walked with a stately air to greet him.
      “I want to thank you for coming today, Mr. Watson.” He took
    Henry’s hand in his own.

   principal had worn a blue suit with a flag lapel pin in honor of
   Henry’s visit. He was African American, and he took care to
   observe the proper forms and customs in all things. He had learned
   that being dignified and reserved kept others—white people—from
   feeling uncomfortable around him, and he learned the lesson so
   well that it became his normal affect.
    When the principal signed the school up for the Veterans in the
   Schools program, he thought of his father, also a World War II vet-
   eran, dead too young. After the war, his father had used the a1 Bill
    to buy a house in East Palo Alto, called East even though oddly it
   was actually north of Palo Alto. East Palo Alto, £.p.4., a poor and
   unincorporated area that was redlined by bankers and brokers and
   the only place in the area where his father could get a mortgage
   because he was black. His father held on to that house the rest of
   his life and raised a family there. He had been a mechanic for the
   US Army Air Corps and fought in no famous battles, but the prin-
   cipal thought that he was as much a hero as any veteran.
    The principal himself was a veteran of Vietnam, a Ranger, a
   lurp. When he came home to California and found no honor for
   what he’d done, he tried to forget the past. He took a degree from
   San José State, became a teacher, rose to be principal. Yet he noted
   that the Veterans in the Schools rarely if ever included vets from
   Vietnam, and he thought cynically that heroes are chosen by the
   times, not by the deeds, and that the ambiguities of Vietnam did
   not suit the country’s mood.
     But he did not like to act out of bitterness, and none of this his-
   tory was the fault of the elderly man who was giving up his time to
    visit the class. He wanted the [visit ] [to ] [be ][a ] [success ] [and ] [the ] [students ]
    to find inspiration. That was his job—that was the expectation.
    He turned to Carter. “And this is. . .”
    “My grandson, Carter.”
     “P’m glad you came. You must be proud having a Pearl Harbor
   vet as a grandfather.”
     Carter grunted.

    leum tile. It was quiet, but muffled sounds pushed out as they
    passed the closed classroom doors. The principal explained that
    they would be meeting Miss Anderson’s class of fifth graders, and
    that she had been preparing the students for his visit.
     He paused in front of one heavy door in a green metal frame
    and leaned in. It was perfectly quiet.
     “You should go in first,” he whispered to Henry.
     Henry lifted his beret and ran a hand over his smooth head. He
     still sometimes unconsciously went to pat down his hair, finding
    then that it was gone.
     He replaced his beret at what he hoped was a jaunty angle and
    pushed open the door.
     A chorus of young voices greeted him. “Thank you, Mr. Watson.”
     The children sprang to their feet, all dressed in red, white, and
    blue. Miss Anderson had the idea to honor their visiting veteran
    by asking every child to wear some combination of blue pants and
    white shirt or red blouse, or striped red and white shirt. She was
    a young second-year teacher, and she supported the troops, and
    she intended to show it. She herself was dressed in a blue wool
    skirt and white blouse and used a flag pin to hold a red scarf in
    place. The classroom had also been decorated with crepe streamers
    in red, white, and blue, hanging like bunting along the walls and
    swinging from the light fixtures in arcs above the children’s heads.
    The bright colors were cartoonish, like the interior of an ice cream
    parlor.
     Miss Anderson introduced herself to Henry and led him to a
    chair she called the seat of honor in front of the blackboard. Some
    students had chalked the words Pearl Harbor Veteran in big block
    letters above the chair, so that when he sat down the letters arced
    above his head. The principal stood near the teacher’s desk, but
    Carter remained slouched against the wall beside the door, thin
    and uninterested.
     The children were of many heritages, with parents who came
    from all over the world, and they stared at Henry—a large white

   funny, different from the adults they saw every day, who were all
   quick and busy and connected. He looked like he was from another
   time, an exhibit that took its place under the sign identifying its
   importance.
    Henry shifted uncomfortably, and Miss Anderson began by hav-
   ing the class recite facts about Pearl Harbor. She asked questions,
   and they sang out the memorized answers. What was the date of
   the attack? December 7, 1941. What time did the attack begin?
   Seven fifty a.m. How long did the attack last? One hundred ten
   minutes. How many Americans lost their lives? Two thousand four
   hundred and three. What American ship was damaged the worst?
   The Arizona. Who was president? Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
   What did he do after Pearl Harbor? Declared war on Japan. What
   did he call Pearl Harbor in his speech? A date which will live in
   infamy.
    The young piping voices were a little muddied on the last two
   answers, but Miss Anderson turned to Henry for his approval, and
   he nodded. The principal also nodded, and Miss Anderson read
   that as approval for how she was running the classroom.
    “Now Mr. Watson is going to share some of his own memories
   of that day,” Miss Anderson said. “He was on a ship called the Phoe-
   nix and stayed in the navy until the end of the war.”
    Henry stood up. A rough map of Pearl Harbor was sketched
   out on the chalkboard, and he began by drawing a line where the
   battleships were anchored near Ford Island and then placing an
   X where the Phoenix had been tied up, to the northeast. He told
   how he had been eating breakfast on the mess deck when he heard
   the call to General Quarters, and the first explosions began. Gen-
   eral Quarters, he explained, meant [that ] [everyone ] [in ] [the ] [crew ] [had ]
   to be at battle stations—engine [crews, ] [gunners, ] [damage ] [control, ]
   everyone. His station was [on ] [the ] [port ] [bridge ] [wing, ] [ready ] [to ] [take ]
   bearings to fix the ship’s position [once ] [they ][got ][under ] [way. ] [He ] [was ]
   wearing a big helmet over [a ][sound-powered ] [phone ] [set, ] [so ] [he ][could ]
   talk to the chart room.

    row of ships was not heavily targeted, but they were trying to get
    moving so that they wouldn’t be sitting ducks. From the bridge, he
    could see explosions and fire coming from the battleships, and he
    remembered seeing the masts of the Oklahoma slowly tilting as the
    big ship turned turtle.
     Henry drew an arrow over the place where his ship had been
    anchored. He said part of the second wave of Japanese planes came
    very near his ship, but passed over to strafe targets on Ford Island.
    There were more explosions from Battleship Row, but it was lucky
    for the country that aircraft carriers like the Enterprise weren’t in
    port when the attack came.
      “J just remember how beautiful Oahu was that morning. Beau-
     tiful green island floating in a blue sea, looking like paradise. And
    in a moment it was filled with death. We did our duty. That’s all
     it came down to. We did our duty, that day and the years that fol-
    lowed, hoping we could see the end of the war and come home
    again.”
     The principal walked to Henry’s side. “Here’s what you have to
    remember. Henry Watson, and all the other men and women who
    served with him, did what their country asked them to do. They
    sacrificed their youth and sometimes their lives. And we should
    thank them all. So let’s say ‘thank you’ together.”
     “Thank you,” the children chorused.
     The principal nodded, thinking that some small part of that
    thanks might be directed toward his own father. It was a private
    thought, and he would not share it.
     “Now, do you have any questions?” he asked.
     Several of the children raised their hands. They had written out
    questions ahead of time, and Miss Anderson called on them one by
    one. How old were you when you joined the navy? What medals
    did you get? What did you do when you heard the war was over?
     Henry answered the questions one by one, smiling at the ques-
    tioners sitting at their half-size desks. He paused a bit when one
    girl asked him why he’d joined the navy. He knew that he might be

   didn’t have much use for him. So he avoided the real question and
   said that he’d joined the navy because he’d always liked the ocean.
    Then one boy asked Henry if he had ever been scared, and he
   said he had been, many times. “Everyone was scared at some point
   or other,” he said.
    He glanced at Carter, still leaning against the wall in the rear of
   the classroom, gazing at the ceiling, as though bored. None of the
   talk seemed to have broken through the moody circle he’d drawn
   around himself.
    Henry looked at his watch, stood up. “I’m sorry, but we’re going
   to have to leave early. Medical appointment.”
    Miss Anderson was confused, but she responded as she thought
   the principal would like. “Well, let’s give Mr. Watson one more big
   thank-you for coming. Class?”
    “Thank you, Mr. Watson,” they sang.
    Back in the Buick, Carter drove without knowing where they
   were going, but happy to be out of the school. He thought the
   whole thing was really about the Iraq War, and he didn’t like it.
    He knew they were hours early for the appointment, but he fol-
   lowed the route toward the hospital until Henry told him to take
   Saratoga Road. In the years before the freeway system was built,
   it was common for roadways to be named after their destinations.
    “So where are we going, Grandpa?” he asked.
    “Someplace I’ve had your mother take me before chemo, when
   she’s had the time. You’ll get a chance to practice driving on
   curves.”
    At Saratoga the road narrowed as it went through the old down-
   town. Saratoga was at the edge of the valley, not a thoroughfare,
   and it had retained some of its old distinctive shape around the
   town square. The blacksmith [shop ] [was ] [now ][a ][French ] [restaurant, ]
   and the five-and-dime was [an ] [antique ] [store ] [and ] [the ] [old ][brick ] [bank ]
   was now a cozy bar and [grill, ] [but ] [the ] [building ] [facades ] [had ] [been ]
   preserved and ornate green [streetlamps ] [and ] [benches ] [and ] [planters ]
   lined the sidewalks.

    sharply around tall stands of second-growth redwoods, and they
    passed signs for Boy Scout camps and a Lutheran retreat and old
    health resorts. Carter had never driven such a twisty road, and he
    fought the car around the turns, entered them too fast and then
    oversteered coming out of them, putting the tires over the double
    yellow line before regaining the right side of the road. The red-
    wood trees sprang up repeatedly, seemingly right in his path, and
    meant another jerk to the left or right.
     “Good practice,” Henry said.
      “Sure,” Carter said.
      “Just slow down going into a turn and accelerate out of it.”
     “Okay.” Carter was hunched over the wheel and gripping it
    with both hands.
      At a sign for a vineyard, Henry said, “Turn right here.”
      Carter cautiously turned the Buick onto a side road, and they
    climbed out of the steep creek bed and broke onto a broad slant-
    ing hilltop. The road ran between blocks of vineyard, rows of
    vines with the ragged look of being recently harvested and not yet
    pruned. Below the road, the blocks of vineyard ended in sloping
    grassland and scrub oak. Above, the cultivated land adjoined the
    old redwood forest.
     The winery building was designed to look vaguely European.
    After parking, they entered through an iron gateway into a small
    courtyard with grapevines climbing trellises along the walls and a
    round fountain playing at the center. French doors opened beyond
    the courtyard and led to the tasting room, a broad, airy space dec-
    orated with blond woods and bright chandeliers. A long row of tall
    windows out the back of the tasting room overlooked a broad ter-
     race and gave views of the Santa Clara Valley. In summer, all the
    windows would be open, but in October they were closed.
      Carrie Yamamoto, standing behind the counter, felt bored as
    soon as Henry shambled in, followed by Carter. Two more tour-
     ists, she thought. She had a business degree from Santa Clara, and
    she’d thought that working for a vineyard would be exciting, but

   that brought no respect from the winemaker, who called it Dis-
   neyland. He was always bragging that he’d been in the doctoral
   program in enology at Davis and then quit, because the best didn’t
   finish their degrees, they went out and did the work, the real work
   of making wine.
    The winemaker. He was in his thirties and liked to make her
   feel small before he hit on her. She always turned him down
   politely because she couldn’t afford to alienate him. But she knew
   his type—Asiaphiles, noodle chasers, the kind of guy who would
   say he only dated Asian women and expect you to take it as a com-
   pliment. She sometimes wondered if that’s why he gave her the
   job, so that he could hit on her.
    Even though she already wanted to get out for the day, she
   straightened up as the two approached. She knew that being suc-
   cessful with the tasting room was her ticket to rise, to land those
   events with sommeliers from fine restaurants, to build up her own
   network and her own credentials. And then she could move on,
   drive her Miata to a new job, a better job, and leave that wine-
  maker far behind. .
    She saw the boy was too young to drink, but she didn’t think he
   would ask. It was in groups that someone underage tried to get a
   glass of wine, usually a nineteen-year-old sophomore from Stan-
   ford with a twenty-two-year-old boyfriend.
    “Can I help you?” she asked.
    Henry rubbed the small white fringe of beard at his chin, the
   only facial hair that returned after his treatments. “Pouring any
   sparkling wines:”
    “Our blanc de noirs. Or we have a special cuvée, vintage 1999.”
    “The blanc de noirs will be fine.”
    She uncapped the heavy bottle and poured a flute full for him.
   The wine held a pale tinge of red, and small bubbles climbed verti-
   cally up the sides of the glass. He requested a Calistoga for Carter,
   also in a flute, and he paid her. Then they walked together onto the
   terrace and sat at a cast-iron café table and looked out at the valley.

    before the treatment again wrested away all pleasure in taste. To
    enjoy the landscape, the belvedere, designed to offer a sense of ease
    and fulfillment and mastery. It was pretend, make-believe, but it
    allowed him to beguile the sense of death stalking and get through
    another treatment and rise again. It helped him retain that sense of
    control now escaping him.
     He’d had the foolish hope that Katherine and Carter—and Betty,
    don’t forget—moving into his house would effect a kind of resto-
    ration. All would come to his Peaceable Isle and find their happi-
    ness, and he would feel what he’d felt when his wife was young
    and alive and his children with him. Now he felt he could conjure
    happiness for no one. Carter was in his life intimately now, more
    intimately than his own sons, perhaps, who had never taken him
     to treatment, never seen him wrecked in the aftermath. But that
    intimacy would bring no remedy for Carter’s own moody retreat,
    which Henry could only feel but not alter.
     Carter was looking skeptically at the champagne flute full of
    mineral water, at the sandstone walls and slate terrace. “This is
    kind of fake-o,” he said.
     Henry sipped his blanc de noirs. “The wine is real. You’re real.
    I’m real.”
     “Yeah.” Carter was unconvinced. “That Pearl Harbor talk was
    pretty fake-o too, wasn’t it.”
      “It was,” Henry admitted. “Listen, I’ll tell you something real
    about Pearl Harbor, something that doesn’t get into the stories
    people want to hear. We got the Phoenix under way, and we had
    our guns firing into the sky at all those planes, the loudest noise
    you could think of. And the battleships were burning, big clouds
    of black smoke, and water was covered with oil and some of it
    was on fire, right on top of the water, and your mouth tasted like
    diesel. And there were some bodies in the water as well, young
    men not much older than you. We got out of the harbor, looking
    for enemy ships or subs. The attack was over then, but we didn’t
    know that.

   ting down on the mess deck. And we didn’t eat until around ten at
   night, when we were out at sea and standing down from General
   Quarters. The ship was dark. That meant that all the porthole cov-
   ers were dogged down, and you couldn’t even light a cigarette on
   any weather deck. But I stood in line, and I got a cup of hot coffee
   and a sandwich, and it was the best thing I ever ate. It was deli-
   cious. Because I was so hungry. And because I could have died that
   day. That’s the real thing.”
    Carter nodded. “What kind of sandwich?” he asked.
    “Fried Spam and onion.”
     “Best thing ever?”
     “Best thing ever. Here.”
    Henry took Carter’s flute, spilled out the water, and filled it with
   haif his sparkling wine.
    “A toast,” he said. “To the best thing ever.”
     “I don’t know what mine is yet,” Carter said.
    “Yours is still coming,” Henry said. “You’ve got a lot of time.
   Believe that. Okay?”
    “Okay.” :
    They touched glasses and drank. The valley below them spread
   out in tan and black and green, stitched with expressways, platted
   with tract housing and office parks and malls, home to a million
   and more.
    Henry decided to drive down the hill and to the oncology clinic,
   because of the sharpness of the road and the half glass of wine
   Carter had drunk. He wheeled [the ] [Buick ] [out ] [of ] [the ] [parking ] [lot ]
   in front of the tasting room and [drove ] [back ] [through ] [the ] [blocks ] [of ]
   harvested grapes to the road along Saratoga Creek.
    The car, even in Henry’s hands, didn’t seem to be under control.
   He found himself taking turns too wide and braking to bring his
   car back into his lane, then unwittingly speeding up again before
   the next curve. Points of the road led straight off into the ravine
   before doubling back at the last instant, and the stands of red-
   woods sprang up from nowhere.

    for the gentling of the slope and the broadening of the valley that
    would tell him they were close to Saratoga. He leaned forward,
    over the steering wheel. The road was hazy, as though his tires
    were barely in contact with the pavement. He thought that if he
    could just get back to the level, he would be fine.
     He turned the wheel to the left, and his tires screeched. He was
    going too fast. But the town had to be close. He was sure of it.
     “Grandpa...”
     A car leaped in his way. A yellow car, enormous, filling his
    windshield.
     He cut the tires hard right. A horn blared. Air bags exploded all
    around them.

   KATHERINE HEARD about the wreck at work and had to leave
   an in-box of email full of inquiries about travel, hotel and confer-
   ence registration, seminar schedules, special dietary needs, visas
   post 9/11, and odd questions about golf. (Did they rent Big Berthas
    at Spanish Bay? Who knew?) She told Rajni she would be back as
   soon as she could. Heber asked what was wrong, and Katherine
   laughed.
     “[’m just going crazy, that’s all,” she said.
     “Is there anything I can do to help?” he asked.
    Katherine laughed again.
    She drove to the emergency room at the Community Hospital
   in Los Gatos. On the way, she talked with Carter on her cell and
   found out that neither of them had more than a few bruises, though
    a few bruises for an eighty-year-old man like her father might be
   more than a few bruises for a fifteen-year-old. She was relieved, in
   a way, that her father had been driving and not her son. It wouldn’t
   make insurance rates for Carter astronomical in a year or two,
   and he’d been having such a hard time she didn’t want him to feel
   guilty about not having gotten his grandfather to chemo safely. She
   wanted him to feel good about being able to help out. But she was
   exasperated by the fact that they had gone to the winery at all. What
   was her father thinking? Now he had missed his appointment,
   and the Buick was totaled, and she would have to take him herself
   tomorrow and miss another day of work, because there was no way
   they were going to postpone his treatment. She remembered the
   last time he had tried to go off chemo and went six weeks between
   checkups. The lesions had multiplied, and his psa shot up, and the
   oncologist had put him in for a treatment that very day.
    She couldn’t stay angry with her father, though, when she
   picked them up and he looked [so ] [sheepish, ] [both ] [about ] [going ][to ] [the ]

    she drove Carter to the high school for drama rehearsal. Carter
    told her he thought he could get a ride home, but she told him to
    call her if he couldn’t. It would be dark, and late, and she’d had
    enough emergencies for one day. Then she went back to work.
     The office building was dark, and she had to tap in a security
    code on a shiny metallic keypad [to ] [let ] [herself ] [in. ] [She ] [turned ] [the ]
    fluorescent lights on above the bay of workspaces she shared with
    Rajni and Heber, and she clicked on her mouse to wake up her
    computer. There was a sticky note attached to the side of the screen
    in Rajni’s hand, saying that the Colonel had been by to ask about
    her and didn’t seem pleased that she was gone.
     Katherine sat down and looked despondently at the scene that
    appeared on her computer screen, two white beach chairs in the
    shade of a grass hut overlooking a tropical lagoon. In truth, she
    liked her job. All the months of planning coming to fruition in a
    single long weekend, when people from around the country and
    the world gathered to learn about the software and exchange ideas
    and take something back that would make their jobs and their
    businesses better and more efficient. The company had been small
   when she was hired, only thirty employees, but even then the
    president and company owner told her that they would never stop
    improving their software, there would be continuous progress, and
    so a continuous need to educate and inform. She liked feeling part
    of that. Continuous progress. It reminded her of what she heard
    about Disneyland when she was young: Disneyland will never
    be finished—anything is possible in Disneyland. During confer-
    ence weekend, she was constantly busy with one crisis or another,
    always on her Blackberry, running from place to place. But after-
    ward, she was able to reflect on what she’d brought together and
    feel a real satisfaction.
     On her desk, Katherine kept photographs of Betty and Carter,
    one of her father in his beret and a Hawaiian shirt, and an old
    photo of her mother at Christmas, a scalloped-edged print taken
    with a Brownie camera in which the russet and gold of her dress

   she kept a small hand mirror. She looked like hell. She looked
   exhausted. Her makeup was trashed. Her hair was chopped into
   layers, and her stylist wouldn’t let her grow it out. It would be a
   bad-hair year before she got it looking like she wanted it.
    She put down the mirror. It would be stupid to fix her makeup
   when the rest of the building was dark and deserted. She looked
   around, even though she knew she was alone, then reached
   behind herself and unsnapped her bra and shimmied out of it by
   pulling her arms back in through the sleeves of her blouse. Then
   she breathed in and out deeply and attacked the work at hand.
   She hoped that Carter wouldn’t need a ride home later, since she
   wanted to get all caught up, especially with the Colonel breathing
   down her neck and the need to take her father to chemo tomorrow.
     At ten o’clock, she stood up and stretched. She had a book with
   the title Desk Yoga, and she always intended to read it and incorpo-
    rate the simple stretches into her day, but she never did. She only
   stretched when she’d been working too long and was trying to
   ignore that her lower back was killing her. She checked her Black-
   berry to make sure that it had been on and that she hadn’t missed
   any messages from her son, and she ran her thumb gently down
   the side of the device. Even though she worked for a software com-
   pany, there seemed to be something magical about the technology,
   something that needed tending and attention to work properly.
    No word, no messages. She wished she had told him to call her
   when he had gotten home. She thought about calling him, but
   wasn’t sure if that would be too overbearing and show that she
   didn’t have any confidence in him.
    Yoga. She opened the book and stood with her hands in prayer
   position before her and then lifted them up and bent over at the
   waist and let her upper body hang. This was supposed to be relax-
   ing, but as she was bending, [she ] [noticed ] [her ] [bra ] [hanging ] [over ] [the ]
   back of her chair, and she made [a ][mental ] [note ] [not ] [to ] [leave ] [it ][hang- ]
   ing there when she left, and [then ] [she ] [became ] [self-conscious ] [about ]
   bending over without a bra [on ] [when ] [she ][was ] [alone ] [in ][the ] [building. ]

```
    intruding, and it wasn’t relaxing at all, and finally she thought
    about making herself a cup of coffee.
     At the end of the long space that had been cut into cubicles and
    bays were a sink and counter and refrigerator and several coffee-
    makers, an espresso maker, and electric kettles for the tea drink-
    ers. In the freezer, coffee of various kinds was stowed, all in metal-
    lic bags rolled tightly shut. Those who drank Peet’s claimed it was
    far superior to Starbucks, and one person bought only LaVazza
    for espresso and refused to drink anything else. Katherine found
    Peet’s coffee too intense, and she used a mix of half-caffeinated
    Lightnotes, but she didn’t like to admit it since it sounded wimpy.
    She packed the cup of the espresso maker full and twisted it into
    place. It was the fastest cup of coffee, and she needed a good jolt.
     Three hours of work, and she was only half caught up. And time
    off tomorrow again to take her father in. She didn’t want another
    note in her file from the Colonel before annual performance
    reviews. She had been with this company for a long time, but she
    didn’t feel indispensable, like Ron Newbury with his pet mammals
    in small cloth sacks around his neck, and the other men, so many
    men, who said things like Code hard, Rage in pup, Don’t be a Douche-
   grammer. And seniority hadn’t saved Scott, had it? The last time
    she had been to see a dentist was before she’d moved back in with
    her father, because she didn’t want to take time off from work, and
    sometimes she thought all her teeth would fall out. One tooth had
   broken two years ago, a high point on a molar around a deep sil-
    ver filling that dated from her teens, and she’d needed a crown.
   Now she expected that the teeth around her other fillings would
    crack, and she wouldn’t have time or money to get them fixed, and
    she would become a crack-toothed hag with hair that wouldn’t
   grow out.
     She poured her coffee, dumped the grounds, walked back to her
    desk. Her screen saver was on, and she spent a moment watching
    the images of paradise cycle through. Then she looked at Heber’s
    desk, tidy and straightened up. He’d left no loose ends at the end of

   with a few Post-it Notes of different colors sticking up from it, as
   though he actually consulted it. An enigmatic photo, the one that
   made Rajni think he was gay, was the only photo on the desk. He
   looked twenty years old, and he stood beside another young man
   the same age. They were in Toledo, Ohio, in front of the Toledo
   Museum of Art, and they were both wearing black pants and white
    shirts, with a plastic nameplate above their left pockets. They were
   not touching, did not have an arm around each other’s shoulder—
   rather, they looked sober and serious, the wait until the camera
   shutter opened and closed an obvious strain. Heber told Katherine,
   when she asked, that it was a photo from his Mormon mission,
   but when she said OA, you’re Mormon, he said no, he wasn’t, and
   smiled without explaining anything.
     Heber wasn’t Mormon, but he didn’t drink coffee, or diet Coke
    like some in the office. A homely jar of Postum was on his desk, a
   “roasted grain beverage,” the kind of thing Katherine associated
   only with aged aunties and hairnets. She picked up the jar, then
   put it down. She knew she wasn’t being highly effective. She was
   being nosy. She picked up Heber’s copy of 7 Habits and opened it
    to one of the pages he had bookmarked, about the “Time Manage-
   ment Matrix.”
    Amazingly, she discovered that the book advocated spending
   more time on relationships, on building production capacity, and
   less time on crises and deadlines. Spend more time in Quadrant
   Three (planning and building relationships), and you'll spend less
   time in Quadrant One (immediate crises). She felt like she spent
   all her time on crises. She sat down and began leafing through the
   book, stopping at places Heber had underlined. It all sounded like
   good advice.
    She took the book to the copier and photocopied a blank weekly
   schedule. There was a section [for ][Weekly ] [Priorities, ] [and ] [she ] [spent ]
   time thinking about what [she ] [needed ] [to ] [accomplish ] [during ] [the ]
   week, rather than simply [reacting ] [to ] [the ] [load ] [of ][emails ] [requesting ]
   an immediate response. The [list ][made ] [her ] [feel ] [calmer. ]

    himself would approve of. If she could manage to get her father to
    cancer treatment, and her son to drama rehearsals, and make sure
    her husband wasn’t going to break into the house or do something
    else crazy and stupid, maybe she would be highly effective, at last.
    She gathered up her purse and her coat, remembered her bra, and
    looked at the schedule. On impulse, she wrote Research Divorce in
    bold letters at the top of her Weekly Priorities.
     At home, the space where the Buick was normally parked in
    the driveway looked blank and lonesome, and Katherine suddenly
    felt sad about the car. Her father had owned it for ten years, only
    putting a couple of thousand miles a year on it recently, and it
   made him happy. She wondered it if would be the last car he ever
    owned. It was parked now in the side lot of a gas station until it
    could be hauled off to a junkyard. From her childhood, she could
    still remember the jingle Wouldn’t you really rather have a Buick...
    this year? And her father, in his retirement, had finally moved up
    to Buick.
     She pulled her Saturn in where she normally did, still leaving
    the Buick’s normal space free, in case it should reappear during the
    night. This year. This was the year, the jingle promised, that you
    could reward yourself, purchase an outward sign of the success
    and well-being you had arrived at. And the jingle said nothing of
    the wreck that age and time made of any sense of wellness.
     She was quiet inside the house, peeked in at Carter sleeping
    faceup, mouth parted. She knew his many postures of rest and
    peace. He was asleep and safe, she could see, and she was glad
    she hadn’t insisted he call her when he arrived home. Whatever
    bruises he had from the car crash weren’t keeping him from
    sleeping.
     She cracked the door to her father’s room and heard him
    snoring. This also she had grown to recognize as rest and peace.
    She had told him not to wait up for her, but she was afraid he
   would anyway. Even as she behaved motherly toward him, he still
   behaved fatherly toward her. And maybe he had the right, since

   ... this year? She went to sleep thinking about being highly effec-
   tive, thinking about drinking Postum and having mastery over
   all the obstinate tasks that presented themselves to her, thinking
   about driving Highway 1 along Big Sur, the driving effortless as
   bird flight.
   The next morning, as she stared out the small window above the
   kitchen sink, she noticed something odd about the driveway, but
   she couldn’t figure out what it was. The coffeemaker gurgled out its
   first pot of the morning, and Katherine didn’t feel awake. She felt
   thick and stunted, and she was still in her bathrobe since she was
   taking her father to chemo instead of going to the office. Some-
   thing about the morning sunlight, the bewildering brilliance.
    Carter was out of the shower, but she didn’t have to hurry this
   morning. She hated having to coordinate bathroom time with her
   son. She’d hated it when she was growing up in this house with
   her two brothers, and she hated it even more now. It embarrassed
   both of them, and it was a step backward from the house in Oak
   Commons, which had a full bath with the first-floor master bed-
   room, separate tub and shower, and two full baths for the bed-
   rooms upstairs. That crazy house that could have put them all in
   bankruptcy.
    Henry blustered out of his bedroom, also in a bathrobe and
   carpet slippers. “Can a man get a cup of coffee in this joint?” he
   growled as he rounded into the kitchen.
    Katherine slipped the pot from the maker and poured coffee
   into two of the odd assortment of mugs that crowded one shelf of
   the cabinet. This morning she ended up with one that advertised a
   serotonin uptake inhibitor, a mug her father must have snagged at
   a doctor’s office.
    Henry put a spoonful of sugar into his mug, while Kather-
   ine drank hers black. She had been worried about getting fat in
   her teens and decided that she was going to learn to drink coffee

```
     Henry sipped his coffee. “By God, you’ve got a good hand in the
    kitchen. Where would I be without you?”
     “Thanks, Dad.” Katherine looked back out the windows
    distractedly.
     “What are you looking at?”
     “Nothing,” she said. “Just the funny sunlight.”
     “Hmmm.” The galley kitchen was so narrow that he had to lean
    past her to look out the window. “Well, either my Buick has come
    back to life, or there’s another car with a hell of a Simonizing job
    parked in its place.”
     “What?”
     Katherine belted her bathrobe tightly around her and walked
    out the front door, followed by Henry in his bathrobe. Several sec-
    onds later, Carter stood behind them, also in his bathrobe, with his
    hair still wet.
     The Fury had been detailed by an expert. Its dark-green paint
    gleamed with a depth that invited them forward to caress it—the tires
    had been blacked and the interior conditioned so that the old vinyl
     seats shone like buttery leather. Any sign that it had hit a seventeen-
    year-old boy and run over his leg was, no doubt, cleaned away.
      “That’s Scott’s car,’ Katherine said. She approached it slowly,
     like it was a snake, half-expecting to find Scott sleeping in the
    backseat. He wasn’t breaking in—now he would start sleeping in
    their driveway. But the car was empty. She walked around it, stud-
     ied it from all angles, rapped on the trunk to hear that it was hol-
    low and didn’t contain a dead body. The doors were unlocked, and
     an envelope lay on the front seat.
      Carter still hadn’t let on that he’d seen his father two days ago.
    But he wondered if this was one more attempt to buy back his
     love, like his sister said. And this one was more interesting than
    two hundred dollars. The car didn’t look so bad if he was going to
     get to drive it.
     He leaned in the passenger-side window. “There are keys in the
     ignition,” he said. “Mom? You gonna read what’s in the envelope?”

   look like expensive stationery, with an address preprinted in the
   upper left-hand corner. The El Rancho Motel, off Highway 101. A
   small drawing of a mission bell hanging from an adobe arch was
   beside the address.
     “Is this where he’s been staying?” she asked aloud. The enve-
   lope was addressed to her and licked shut, as though Scott was
   afraid of someone else reading their private correspondence. She
   ripped it open and began reading aloud.
    “My Dear Katherine:
      “I know it’s not quite time for you to welcome me back.
     It’s been difficult. I haven’t adjusted to normal life very
    well, since being at sea. Everything seems different from
    when I went away, even though it’s the same and it’s me
    who is different. And so, I haven’t proven myself wor-
    thy of you yet. But I will, if you’ll just have patience and
    wait for me. I’m going away again, for a little while, but I
     will be back on my feet in no time. Meanwhile, I’ll stay in
    touch. ;
      “I’m leaving the car in case Carter can use it, so he doesn’t
    have to walk back and forth to school. Insurance is all paid
     on it through the end of December, so anyone can drive it.
    And I left the signed pink slip in the glove compartment, in
     case something happens to me and I can’t come back.
      “All my love, your husband, Scott.”
     As she read the letter, Katherine’s voice grew louder, until she
   was nearly shouting the last [lines. ] [Her ] [neck ] [grew ] [red, ] [and ] [then ]
   her face flushed. She felt like [her ] [head ] [was ] [going ] [to ] [explode. ] [It ]

   fectly crafted to piss her [off. ] [The ] [sense ] [of ][self-pity. ] [Blaming ] [forces ]
   beyond his control. Pleading [for ][sympathy. ] [Guilt-tripping. ] [Expect- ]

     a brick.
      “Jesus Fucking Christ,” she said. “Why doesn’t he just show up
    with his arm in a sling and a bandage around his head and limp
    around playing a fife? Why doesn’t he just say he’s suffering from
    prsp and that he needs our help to be able to heal? Why doesn’t he
    just blame California for not having scrap-metal drives, and war-
    bond campaigns, and food rationing?”
     “Mom,” Carter went.
     “Not a word about me. Not a word about what I’ve been doing
    while he’s been gone. Not one word [about ] [two ] [teenagers ] [and ] [no ]
    savings and no house.”
     “Mont .\. 27
     “You know what I’d like to do with this car? I’d like to take it to
    Devil’s Slide and put a brick on the gas pedal and run it over the
     cliff! In case something happens to me. He can kiss my ass!”
     “Mom, everyone can hear you.”
     “Good! Let ’em know what a self-centered bastard my hus-
    band was.”
     Henry had walked over and put an arm over her shoulder and
    was walking her back into the house. Three people in bathrobes
    in the front yard on a Tuesday morning wasn’t a normal sight on
    Catesby Street, especially when one was shouting obscenities.
      Carter reached into the Fury and snagged the keys. “Mom? I
    had an idea.”
     “What?” She turned toward him. “Pour gasoline on the car and
    throw in a match?”
     “Do you need to go to work today?”
      “I worked until midnight last night, and I’ve got a Priorities List
     a mile long.”
     “Why don’t you go? I can take Grandpa in Dad’s car. Just like we
    planned to do yesterday.”
     “You think I’d let you drive that?”
     “Why not?”
      “Because.. .”

   needed it, and Scott had been helpful. And then she would owe
   some gratitude to Scott.
    Carter began circling the Fury, running his hands over its sharp,
   squared-off fenders. “This thing is so old, it’s cool.”
     “It’s so old, it doesn’t have air bags,” Katherine said. “That might
   have saved your life.”
    “He drives carefully,” Henry said. “I’m the one who wrecked the
   car yesterday.”
    “You’re ganging up on me.” Katherine watched Carter admir-
   ing the car, suddenly a much more normal fifteen-year-old in love
   with horsepower and independence. It should have been that his
   father taught him to drive, took him to the pmv, and finally, maybe,
   bought him a car. Something large and safe would have been good.
   Instead, her husband abandoned a Fury in their driveway. But here
   was her son, acting as though it was all normal and appropriate,
   all wonderful that a car had appeared, wonderful to grow up and
   learn to drive even though his father was absent.
    Even when he wasn’t trying to, it was easy for her son to make
   her feel guilty, easy for him to make her want to say, “Yes, if it will
   make it up to you. Yes, if it will make you feel better.”
    “Why did he leave the car?” she asked aloud. “I don’t get it.”
    “Just say I can take Grandpa, Mom. I can do it.”
     “I know you can, sweetie,” she said. “Okay. You take Grandpa.
   But don’t get the idea that the car is yours, no matter what the letter
   said. I’m going to track down your [father ] [and ] [have ] [a ][talk ][with ] [him.” ]
    Henry looked at his watch. “If you’re going to go to work, you’d
   better get changed. You’re still in your bathrobe.”
    “What a stupid car. I’ll bet it gets twelve miles a gallon.” She
   turned and marched into the house.
    At the office, she launched directly into the tasks she had left
   from the night before, feeling a surge of power and mastery. She
   was finishing the schedule for the first day of the conference,
   checking off the av requirements for each presentation, when the
   Colonel arrived on his rounds. He began by telling her he was

```

```
    armed him by being easy and casual and even a little flirtatious.
    He blushed a little when she told him that the regimental stripes
    on his tie looked sharp and that red and blue were good colors for
    him. He left without even asking for details about where she was
     at with her work, thinking that anyone who could speak that confi-
    dently must be on top of things.
      Rajni looked at her admiringly after he left. “You're feeling
    good,” she said.
      “[’m faking it,’ Katherine said. “Things are all screwed up and
    confused.”
     “You ought to fake it more often then,” she said. “Keep him out
    of your hair.”
      At quarter to twelve, feeling that she had earned an early lunch
    through her baffling of the Colonel, she drove to the Borders Book-
     store and Café at the McCarthy Ranch Shopping Center. McCarthy
    Ranch was an open-air shopping center nestled alongside a large
    freeway interchange. It had once been a pear orchard, and now
     the large stores had facades recalling the outlines of rustic barns,
    with gambrel roofs sheathed in corrugated metal. Like a ghost of
     the orchard, anonymous trees that aspired one day to bring shade
    were spaced out in canted squares amid the parking places, and
     little islands of decorative grasses and irises sat at the end of the
     lanes.
      Katherine liked the café for a light lunch, and she liked the
    bookstore. She treated it like a library where you could eat, fre-
    quently taking the time to look up information in books that she
    wouldn’t buy unless it was very important. If the bookstore was
    big enough, a superstore, the information was easier to come by
    than through Google, and the process of looking was more pleas-
     ant besides.
     When she was settled at a café table outside, looking up at the
    golden pear that marked the entrance to the shopping center, she
     called Betty in Aptos. Her daughter never called her. Since she’d
    moved in with her boyfriend, into a beach house owned by his

```

```
   had the feeling that Betty treated the calls as a duty she had to ful-
    fill. Katherine didn’t want the calls to seem like she was checking
   up on her daughter. She wanted them to be a way to share some
   warmth and love, maybe friendship. But Betty’s attitude made it
   clear that she needed friendship as little as she needed advice. She
   had made decisions and she was in control, and when she spoke
   with her mother she affected an air of knowingness that Katherine
   put up with because she didn’t know how to break through it.
    Katherine had talked with Betty briefly yesterday to tell her
   about the accident with the Buick. She heard Betty register a bit
   of surprise when she heard Katherine’s voice again, but as soon
   as Katherine asked if she had seen her father, Betty sighed. “Now
   what’s he done?” she asked.
    Katherine told her about his latest move: leaving the car in the
   driveway. As she described the note he left, she felt herself getting
   angry again at the tone of it, the sense of a hurt little boy looking
   for sympathy. And the way leaving the car seemed to buy him favor
   with Carter in a way that wasn’t fair at all.
    “And the worse part is that we can really use the car right now,
   since your grandfather totaled his Buick.”
    Betty clucked with sympathy. She had noticed that her mother
   frequently needed her as a sounding board and adviser, and it flat-
   tered her to play the role. “There’s no reason to turn down the car,
   if it helps you. And it doesn’t mean you’re taking him back.”
    “No?”
    “Of course not. Has he done anything to earn your trust back?”
     “I guess not.”
    “You guess? You know he hasn’t. I’m sorry to say it, because he’s
   still my father, but he’s been a dick. If Ian was acting the way he
   was, I’d be so out of here.”
    “But I can’t just get out of here, like you.”
    “No, but you don’t have to let him in. Truth is, I don’t know
  why you haven’t divorced him.”
    “That wouldn’t bother you?” Katherine asked.

```

-----

```
     “He hasn’t shown up here. I’m probably not as important to
    him as his son.”
      “That’s not true,’ Katherine said.
     “You don’t have to defend him,” Betty said.
     “Where could he be, though?”
      “I don’t know,” Betty said. “You need a car to go anywhere.”
     Katherine called the number of the El Rancho Motel. She talked
     to a pleasant-sounding voice with a South Asian accent that told
    her that they never gave out information on any of their guests.
    She then called the Military Sealift Command, in Norfolk, Virginia,
     to see if she could find out whether Scott had shipped out again.
     If he had, he would be gone for another four months at least, and
    that might be something of a relief. She could just put things on
    hold again and postpone any painful decisions, and maybe Carter
    would have had more of a chance to adjust to the big changes. But
    on the phone, she was shunted from one person to another, until
    finally being told that they had no way of being sure who she was,
    and they couldn’t give out information on their employees.
      Finally, she made a phone call she’d been putting off, to Scott’s
    mother in Las Vegas. Scott’s mother was named Margaret, but since
    moving to Vegas she’d insisted on being called Peggy, like the singer
    Peggy Lee. She met her second husband, a silver-haired man named
    Seth Paul, at a conference on motivational speaking. Katherine dis-
    liked talking to her because everything eventually was turned into
     the language of motivation. But she looked at the time on her Black-
     berry, scrolled down to Peggy’s name, and thumbed the call button.
      She found out instantly that Scott was not in Nevada because
    Peggy asked her when they were coming out to visit and whether
    they would be bringing Betty and Carter. She felt that Carter, espe-
     cially, could benefit from a few days near Seth Paul. Katherine had
     to explain that Scott was not living with her and that in fact she
    was calling to see if Peggy knew where he was. She had told Peggy
     this before, but her mother-in-law never took it as anything more
    than a passing phase.

   was away, getting back on his feet, telling me all about what your
   new life together was going to be like. Imagine that! A handwritten
   letter. So old-fashioned.”
    “Just because he wanted something,” Katherine said, “doesn’t
   mean he’ll get it.”
    “That’s where you’re wrong, dear. If he follows the right steps,
   he can achieve his dreams and get everything he’s entitled to.”
    Katherine knew it was useless to argue with her. “Maybe that’s
   it, then. Maybe he hasn’t followed the right steps,” she said. Like
   not losing all our money on start-ups, not disappearing for six
   months, not breaking into the house, not disappearing again, leav-
   ing a Fury in the driveway.
    “And you can help him,” Peggy said. “If you demand he follow
   the right steps, then you’ll be demanding that he treat you like you
   deserve.”
    “Right now, I’d just like to find him.”
    “He’s probably on some sort of quest. But he’ll come back to
   you. I sense that his inner motivation is strong.”
    Katherine listened to her mother-in-law babble on for several
   more minutes, gathering that she was partly to blame for Scott’s
   failings and absences, but that if she was motivated to change, a
   fairy-tale ending was still possible. [“Just ] [the ] [kind ] [of ][fairy ][tale ] [’m ]
   living every day with Seth Paul.”
    When Katherine finally got her off the phone, she walked to
   the self-help section of the bookstore. Peggy claimed that Seth
   Paul was writing a book on motivation that would be published
   someday, and Katherine sometimes found herself glancing at the
   authors whose names began with P, visualizing it right there.
   Peggy said it would be huge, bigger than the Chicken Soup books or
   The Purpose-Driven Life. The weird thing was, she might be right.
    The divorce shelf was amid the self-help books, as though divorce
   was one more phase in a continuum of books about personal
   growth. There were books about having or saving a healthy relation-
   ship, divorce-prevention books, and then finally the divorce how-to

```

```
     Some of the titles were about no-fault divorce. Others were witty
    and cute and hostile, girding the reader for battle. Protect yourself!
    the covers shouted. Be informed! Get everything you’re entitled
     to! Winning the Divorce Wars had a cover photo with a bride and
    groom on top of a wedding cake. The cake was divided so that the
    bride got two-thirds, leaving a third for the hapless groom.
     Katherine had never bought a book, had never taken the con-
    crete steps to officially end her marriage, because she had trouble
    thinking of herself as the kind of person who got divorced. Her
    aunts and uncles had all stayed married for life, and her own father,
     a widower in his fifties, never remarried. Even her brother in Holly-
    wood had finally gotten married in his forties and now had young
    twins.
      She’d talked to her mother about it, asked her whether she
    should just end her marriage to Scott once and for all. Her mother,
    wise and silent, smiled but refused to answer. Instead, Kather-
    ine found the annoying song that had played at her wedding go
    through her head. “When I fall in love, it will be forever, or I’ll
    never fall—in—love.” She hated that song. And she was the one
    who had picked it out, for the py to play when she and Scott
    danced at their wedding reception. Now she was stuck with it. If
    she divorced, it would mean that the song was a lie. She knew it
    was stupid to care about a corny song with horns and violins that
    had been played some twenty years ago, but the more she told her-
     self she didn’t care about it, the more she found it in her mind. She
    was sick of it.
     Her mother, when Katherine thought about her and talked to
    her, was always beautiful. Her hair was stranded with black and
    gray, worn straight and cut at her chin line, the gray making her
    face seem younger and more lively in contrast. When Kather-
    ine looked in the mirror in the morning, she already thought she
    looked older than her memory of her mother. That was another rea-
    son she’d been reluctant to officially end her marriage, though one
    she had trouble admitting to herself. Scott said he loved her, said he

   able. With Scott, she had at least one person who thought she was.
   Without him, she was a woman with hair that was cut in too many
   layers and whose teeth were going to start falling out one by one.
    She studied the selection of books. Divorce for Dummies seemed
   like a bad idea. She didn’t like the implications. She finally picked
   up a book that was specifically about divorce in California. She
  weighed it in her hand. There were worksheets and forms in the
   back and a cp-rom. The cost was $34.95, and she compared it to
   another book that cost $21.95 and wondered if there was $13 of dif-
   ference. But she decided to buy the more expensive book, decided
   that she was worth it. She wasn’t sure what her own mother thought,
   but Peggy might approve her being motivated.
    Back at the office, she called Carter first to make sure he had
   gotten Henry to and from the chemo ward successfully. Carter
   told her that his grandfather seemed tired, but no more than nor-
   mal after a treatment. She worked on her highly effective list, and
  when she had accomplished a number of items, she called anyone
   she could think of who might know something about where Scott
  might be. She called Reverend Nancy, even though Scott had been
   even less churchgoing than her. She called old neighbors from Oak
  Commons, but had to leave messages since nobody was home. She
   called the outplacement firm where he had been for a few months
   after being laid off, but they hadn’t heard from him. A facilitator
   there asked if he’d found a position commensurate with his talents
   and experience and seemed genuinely baffled when she told him
   he’d been out at sea.
    Midafternoon, she found time to tell Heber she’d leafed through
   his 7 Habits book the night before. [“I ] [hope ] [you ] [don’t ] [mind,” ] [she ]
   said. “It was actually helpful.”
    “I noticed your Weekly Calendar this morning,” he said. “T
   couldn’t help glancing at it.”
    “Qh.” She saw Research Divorce scrawled in large letters at the
   top of the calendar beside her computer.
    “T’m sorry,” Heber said.

```

-----

```
      “If | can help in any way,” Heber said, “let me know.”
     “Thanks. I think number one on my list is just finding him. It’s
     a quest.”
      She’d picked up the book she’d bought once to see if it men-
    tioned what to do if you couldn’t find your spouse. It sounded like
    you could serve notice to an absent spouse if you put an ad in a
    newspaper. “A missing spouse may be served by publication.” One
    more complication. She decided she really should just find him.
      Rajni was intrigued by the book. Her parents had an arranged
    marriage, and divorce was rare back in Bangalore. And even in Sili-
    con Valley, many Indian women who were here on H-4 visas felt
    powerless, completely dependent on their husbands and unable to
    conceive of divorce. She herself had an H-1 visa and a lot of auton-
    omy. Still, she said she would probably end up marrying someone
    approved by her parents, though not necessarily arranged by them.
    There were plenty of eligible Desis in Silicon Valley. And then she
    would be set, or stuck, depending on how it turned out. But in the
    meantime, she was dating as many different guys as she could.
      Near five o’clock, Katherine MapQuested the El Rancho Motel.
    She frowned when she saw the location. It wasn’t in a good part of
     the valley, and she seemed to remember a meth-lab bust in a ware-
    house nearby. She didn’t want to go there alone. But it was the
    only place she knew Scott had been recently, besides her driveway.
    When she was young, she used to pride herself on not thinking
    about how dangerous a location might seem, being happy to seek
     out blues bars in Oakland with Scott and friends. Eli’s Mile High
    Club had always been worth the trip. Now, in her forties, with a
    four-door sedan instead of a beat-up Subaru, she felt intimidated.
    And taking Carter along to look for his father was out of the ques-
     tion. If she was a little scared for herself, she would never expose
    Carter to the same risk.
      She saw Heber neatening up his desk space, gathering up a few
    things into a canvas messenger bag.
     “Hebert?

    He shook his head. “Just driving home.”
    “There’s something you could help me with,” she said. “If you
   have some time.”
    “Sure,” he said. “I’m always happy to help.”

    6
    HENRY’S MEDIPORT, the shunt through which he was hooked
    up to dripping chemicals every three weeks, was implanted just
    below his collarbone. His oncologist recommended the shunt after
     it was clear that he would be on chemotherapy for the rest of his
     life. Much simpler and easier than trying for a vein in the arm or
    the back of the hand every time. Henry sometimes felt it under the
    skin, even though he’d been warned not to poke at it. The mira-
    cle of modern medicine. He was at times grateful for and at times
    resentful of the cold metal finger lying permanently on his chest.
     When Carter brought him back that afternoon in the Fury, he
    settled into the easy chair in the den, put his feet up, and settled in
    with his weakness, nausea, fatigue. He couldn’t bear to listen to the
    news on the radio or the television. The war didn’t seem to be end-
    ing, despite what was said, but he couldn’t follow it through the
    chemical shroud that enveloped him. He would have to be patient,
    wait out the side effects, to grasp those days of life that waited for
    him on the other side. Before the next treatment began the cycle
    once more.
     He asked Carter to put on a stack of his records, the Duke and
    Ella and Woody Herman and Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey.
    His turntable, one that could still hold a half-dozen records sus-
    pended above the disk and drop them one by one into place, was
     so old that Betty had not believed it really could work and pro-
    nounced it phat when it did. Over the music, he heard Carter talk
     to Katherine once, tell her it was all fine and promise not to leave
    his grandfather alone. Then he rested, not quite able to sleep but
     not quite conscious, and waited to hear his daughter’s voice say,
    “’m home.”
      It would all be twilight time until he heard her voice, almost his
     wife’s voice, in the house.

```

-----

```
   Carter was beside him again, telling him that he had rehearsal for
   The Tempest in a little while, but he didn’t want to leave him alone.
   The last record had dropped and played, and the tone arm had
   returned to its place, and a silence ticked through the house. It
   took Henry some time to understand that his grandson was asking
   him to make a decision, to tell him what to do.
    He attempted to rise, but only churned the afghan with his arms
   and legs like an insect on its back. He felt as though someone had
   replaced his brain with mush, but he knew that Carter was ask-
   ing something of him, and he wanted to respond. A grandfather
   who couldn’t help his grandson was pathetic, and he wasn’t ready
   yet to be only that—he still wanted to be a part of the world. He
   pointed to the lever on the side of the chair, and Carter pulled
    it and returned the chair back up straight, and Henry staggered
   upright and threw out his arms to gain balance.
     “Let’s go,” he said.
    “Do you feel well enough, Grandpa?”
    “The hell with feeling bad,” he said. “Let’s go.”
    Henry careened out of the den, pushing off walls and book-
   shelves that seemed to tilt into his path. Carter pointed out that he
   was still in pajamas and a robe, so he crashed down the hall and
   found an Aloha shirt and a pair of blue jeans with stretch elastic
    at the back of the waist. He sat on the bed to pull on the jeans,
   stood upright and buttoned them shut, and he grabbed a beret and
   perched it on his head at an [angle. ] [He ] [thought ] [he ] [looked ] [present- ]
   able enough, until he noticed [that ] [he ][still ] [had ] [on ] [his ] [scuff ][slippers. ]
   The thought of sitting down [once ] [more ] [to ] [put ][on ] [shoes ] [was ] [daunt- ]
   ing. He was afraid he wouldn’t [be ][able ] [to ] [get ][up ] [one ] [more ] [time. ] [So ]
   he decided to just go in his scuffs. Fuck it.
    He pushed himself back down the hall and launched himself
   across the open living room to the front door, where he grabbed
   the door frame and held himself upright. Carter went ahead and
   opened the door of the Fury, and Henry lurched forward along
   the curved cement sidewalk that led from the front porch to the

    heard Carter make one more unanswered call to Katherine before
    getting into the car and starting the engine.
     Carter had heard that K. J. had been hit by a car and had his leg
    broken. He thought it served him right, and he didn’t mind at all
    that K. J. was going to miss a few weeks of school. K. J. could miss
    the whole year for all he cared. But Carter had no idea that he was
    driving the car that had done it. He made no connection between
    the hit-and-run, his father’s new disappearance, and the sudden
    materialization of a perfectly detailed Plymouth Fury in the drive-
    way, so he didn’t hesitate to drive it to school.
     Henry had a handicap tag that could be hung from the rearview
    mirror. He hated to use it and usually left it in the letter holder
    where bills and junk mail ended up. He wasn’t in a wheelchair,
    after all, and he didn’t want to admit that he couldn’t walk well
    after treatments. But Carter had taken it with them and now
    parked next to the Drama Building in a blue-painted spot. It was
    just a minute before rehearsal started.
     “You go on in, Carter,” Henry said. “I think I’ll just put my seat
    back and rest here for a while.”
     “Are you sure?”
     “Sure.” He felt for the lever at the side of the car seat and
    reclined and closed his eyes. “Just like my easy chair at home. You
    go on in. You need to. I’ll follow in just a little bit.”
     Carter tried his cell phone one more time and got no answer.
    Then he patted Henry’s shoulder. “Thanks for coming, Grandpa,’
    he said, and left him in the car in the growing dark.
     Henry shifted to make himself more comfortable, though he
   knew that there was no comfort to be found. He felt empty but
    not hungry, and no known food would have eased him. He felt
    the poison in him, attacking the tumors that might shrink but
    would never disappear, and attacking all the tissues of his body,
    the healthy body that would live if it could. He settled in, again
    with patience. Maybe it wasn’t the smartest thing to be resting here
    instead of at home. He probably would have been fine alone. But

    He drifted as he lay there, coming in and out of wakefulness. He
   didn’t hear the purple Tiburon that pulled up grill to grill with the
   Fury. K. J. had let Mitch and Brownie borrow his car while he was
   laid up to see if they could locate the car that had kneecapped him.
   And when they spotted the Fury, they parked and got out of their
   car to study it.
    “Might be the same one.. .”
    “Looks a lot nicer...”
    “Sure it was a Fury?”
    “Wonder who owns it...”
    “Mighta been washed . . .”
    “Wasn’t a kid driving it then...”
    “Whois s.!?
    Henry gradually heard the voices near the car, unsure what they
   were saying. When he saw shadows fall into the car, he reached
   forward, flipped the lever, and sprang into an upright seated posi-
   tion, like a graveyard jack-in-the-box.
    The two boys near the car jumped to see a human figure sud-
   denly rise into view. They backed up. When the figure reached for
   the handle and opened the door, they turned and stumbled and
   piled into their car. But the time it was standing, roaring at them,
   they had their car in reverse and were speeding backward up the
   alley that led beside the cafeteria to the Drama Building.
    Henry roared once more and laughed as the Tiburon reached
   the street and sped away. Inexplicably, he felt good. He could even
   stand without feeling too severely the little knives that cut into his
   feet. He adjusted his beret, and in his bedroom slippers, he walked
   into the middle of the rehearsal.
    Nobody noticed him at first. The students were sprawled across
   folding chairs arrayed in ragged [semicircles ] [before ] [the ] [prosce- ]
   nium, and several players [were ] [onstage, ] [reading ] [lines. ] [He ] [saw ]
   Carter sitting next to a [girl ][with ] [black ] [hair ] [and ] [two ] [nose ] [rings, ]
   but he walked straight [to ] [Nu. ] [She ] [stood ] [at ] [the ] [focal ] [point ] [of ][the ]
   semicircles, a handwoven [shawl ] [across ] [her ] [shoulders, ] [a ][loose ] [rope ]

    Henry came beside her, she smiled at him as though he were the
    person she most wanted to see at that moment. Carter had told her
    that his grandfather was with him, that he wasn’t feeling well, but
    that he might come in. When Nu pressed him, he told her that his
    grandfather had just had a chemo treatment.
     She put a hand on Henry’s arm and pointed at the stage.
    “There,” she said. “Prospero is presenting visions to his daughter
    and her fiancé. Visions of what their future life will be like. Whole-
    ness and plenty, long life and healthy children.”
     Francisco, as Prospero, held a staff and wore a pointed wizard’s
    hat, but otherwise was in jeans and a T-shirt. Windy and Cal, the
    daughter and her lover, sat at his feet, and they watched two girls
    standing on a platform upstage. On the wall behind them, leafy
    shapes and palm fronds were painted, suggesting a tropical forest
    receding into the distance.
     “That’s Juno,” Nu whispered. “And Ceres, Goddess of the Harvest.”
     The girl playing Ceres began a speech that Henry remembered
    from reading the play, a speech that promised an ideal life—
    vineyards and orchards heavy with fruit, storehouses rich with
    the earth’s richness, winter brief and mild and followed quickly
    by spring.
     Henry said quietly, “That’s what every father would wish for his
    child, whether or not he’s a wizard.”
     “Even though it’s just a vision?” Nu asked. “Even though we’re
     all going to fall short?”
     “Fathers want their children to believe in happiness. They want
    their children to believe in the story, even if they can’t.”
     Nu clapped her hands, and the play onstage stopped. She could
    always command everyone’s attention in an instant, and she effort-
    lessly projected her voice throughout the room.
     “We have a guest with us,” she said. “A special guest, Carter’s
    grandfather, Henry Watson.”
     Carter sat up proud, looked to make sure that Blossom Haven
    was paying attention.

   some insights into the play by doing a little improv with us.”
    She held out her hand.
    “Come on, Henry.”
    “I don’t know anything about acting,” Henry said.
    “Just be yourself,’ Nu said.
    She leaned closer, so that only he could hear.
    “You know more about this play than any of these kids.”
    Henry saw Carter smiling, genuinely smiling without restraint.
    “Okay,” he said. He took her hand, and she took him up some
   stairs at the edge of the stage and out onto the boards, under the
   gold-lettered sign proclaiming “The Theater of California.” Pieces
   of the unfinished set poked out from the wings. A tilting mast with
   antique rigging, deadeyes and lanyards and ratlines, to signify the
   decks of a ship in danger of sinking. A bending palm tree on a car-
   riage, which could be rolled out to suggest the exotic island where
   the play takes place. All made of lath and papier-maché, all the
   sham trappings of theater. Yet it was brighter onstage, and the stu-
   dents down in the chairs were dim and shadow faced, and Henry
   didn’t feel as though he were stepping into fakery. The stage felt
   like a high place, clear and luminous.
    Nu gave Henry Prospero’s staff, and Francisco left the stage,
   but she told the students playing Ceres and Prospero’s daughter,
   Miranda, and her lover, Ferdinand, to stay. And she said that she
   would play Ariel, the spirit at Prospero’s command.
    Nu prompted Ceres to read her speech again, and she did, again
   promised the blessing of abundance to the young couple.
    When she finished, she looked at Nu for a sign. Ferdinand had
   the next line, but he looked [to ] [Nu ] [for ] [direction ] [as ] [well. ] [Henry ]
   stood silently, leaning on the staff, gazing past everyone.
    Nu began to skip and dance, lissome as a young girl, and she
   twirled about Henry. “Sir.” She leaned toward him. “Were I human,
   and not composed of air, I would grow tender at this speech.”
    Henry smiled. He thought Nu must be at least sixty, yet her
   movements showed no age. “It does make me tender,” he said.

```

```
     Henry nodded. “You bet. It’s what every father should wish for
     his child.”
     Nu took Henry by the arm and walked him downstage and
    spoke with him as though the other characters couldn’t hear.
     “Even though it is but a vision? Even though it will melt into
     thin air?”
     “Even so.” Henry knew now that Nu wanted him to repeat what
    he had said for all the students. “It’s better if his children believe
     that it’s possible. Even if it’s just a wish for the way we’d like things
     to be.”
     Nu went up on her dancer’s toes. “I have news for you, sir. Cali-
    ban is coming to kill you.”
      “Caliban?” Henry asked.
      “Aye, sir,” she said. “Caliban, that thing of darkness you
    acknowledge as your own. He seeks your death.”
      “That’s no news to me,” Henry said.
      Jeffrey, the weight lifter playing Caliban, hulked up to the stage.
    He approached Henry and leaned toward him. “All the charms of
    Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you. A southwest wind blow
    on you and blister you all over.”
      “It’s done, Caliban,” Henry said. “It’s already done. I’ll never be
     free from you.”
     Nu stood up, suddenly herself and no longer the spirit Ariel.
     “Bravo,” she said.
      Carter began to clap, and the rest of the students sitting in the
    folding chairs joined in, and the players onstage applauded Henry
     as well. He smiled mildly, his shoulders fell in a little, and he
    descended from the stage.
     Henry scarcely noticed the continuation of the rehearsal. He
    slumped back in a folding chair next to Carter, rested his head
    forward on his chest, and let the lines and the scenes wash over
    him. He had never felt so tired. Even when Carter went up to play
    Trinculo, he didn’t pay attention. Distantly, he heard Nu using his
    name, asking how Mr. Watson would understand a line—We are

   so new, or mankind so beauteous, as Miranda exclaimed.
    When they took a break, Nu invited him to join her outside for a
   moment. He bent forward over his knees and pushed forward and
   rose to his feet. Carter was at one side to steady him, but Nu took his
   hand and led him through the heavy metal doors to the rocky ground
   between the stuccoed side of the building and the chain-link fence.
   One streetlight filtered through the pine trees that had been planted
   between the parking lot and the building. Henry leaned against the
   building and smiled, and Nu took a cigarette from her purse.
    “Thanks for that,” she said. “The students really got something
   out of it.”
    Henry waved his big paw. “It was nothing.”
    “You’re welcome to the theater anytime. Just to sit and watch.”
   She lit her cigarette with a small butane lighter. “Smoke?” she asked.
    “Naw.” He half smiled. “Bad for my health.”
    “Here. Try this.” She reached into an interior pocket of her
   enormous purse and drew out a single tightly rolled joint. Henry
   cocked his head in curiosity. She held it up to his face, and he
   opened his lips and took it in.
    “Call it medical marijuana,” she said. “White Rhino. When I
   light it, breathe in deeply and hold it.”
    Henry nodded. She thumbed her lighter and he inhaled, and
   the paper twinkled and the smoke was odd and sweet. He took the
   joint from his mouth, held his breath, and felt his lungs expand.
   Then he coughed out, and Nu smiled.
    “That’s probably good for the first time,” she said.
   After the rehearsal, Carter asked if they could drop Blossom Haven
   off on their way home. Henry didn’t understand, so Carter explained
   that the girl standing next to him was named Blossom Haven.
    “My mother was a hippie,” Blossom Haven explained.
    “Yes?” Henry said. “And what is she now?”
    “Now? Now she’s a single mother and an LT.”

```

-----

```
      “Sure, we can take Blossom home,” Henry said. “Just drive safe.
    We wouldn’t want to have Blossom injured.”
     He carefully lowered himself into the passenger’s seat. Getting
     in and out of a car, the simplest thing that people accomplish every
    day without thought, was a risky task at his age, especially when
    he felt weakened by chemo. And he felt a certain floaty feeling that
    he thought might be the marijuana. He had to look for handholds
     to brace himself and take his weight for the moment when his
    knees gave out and he was going down and hoping that his bot-
    tom would land safely on the car seat. Younger people didn’t know
    what a relief it could be to find yourself securely seated. He lifted
     his legs with his hands to help his feet into the car, then reclined
     the seat back so that he was lying out.
      Carter took the driver’s seat, and Blossom Haven rode directly
    behind him. Carter had never had a girlfriend before and wasn’t
     sure if he had one now. He thought that Blossom Haven /iked him,
    and he liked her, but he didn’t know anything about what to do
     next. At fifteen, girls had had boyfriends, sometimes two or three,
    but not many boys had had girlfriends. As he drove, he felt her
    hand on his shoulder, and he touched it with his hand before he
    returned both hands to the wheel. Nine and twelve o’clock. He
    concentrated on the road and driving and following the directions
     that Blossom Haven was giving him.
      She lived with her mother in an apartment complex called
    Cherry Creek Arms, a complex that dated from the seventies
    and had originally been built as “Singles Apartments.” Three
     blocks of apartments two stories high formed a triangle around a
    kidney-shaped swimming pool intended as a social gathering place
     for swinging singles until they eventually paired off, married, and
    bought real estate in the adjoining subdivision. But as real estate
     prices increased through the eighties and nineties, with few peri-
     ods of backsliding, the apartments became more like a dead end.
    The pool was now boarded over, and most of the studios or one-
    bedroom apartments were lived in by women and men in their

```

   the Silicon Valley of 2003.
    The unit they lived in was a one-bedroom with an efficiency
   kitchen, and Blossom Haven slept on a futon in the front room.
   Her mother had decorated the walls with chimes, and posters of
   yoga poses, and bearded men with the red tilak on their forehead,
   and handwoven hangings, and there were candles of various sizes
   and colors on all the low tables. She taught at the Just for Your
   Health College of Massage and worked at two day spas that offered
   massage along with facials, and she had a portable table that she
   took on house calls. They lived in a valley of abundance, she told
   Blossom Haven, and they could live like birds off the abundance as
   long as they were not covetous.
    Blossom Haven sometimes thought her mother was full of shit.
   She knew who had money at school and who didn’t, and she knew
   that she didn’t. She usually hated her name. And she found her
   mother especially infuriating after she completed a session of yoga
   and came out of shavasana and just sat there, in a lotus position,
   with an utterly blissful expression on her face. Just sat there, on a
   rubber mat, on thin carpeting, with no furniture.
    When she was thirteen, Blossom Haven started to stay out late
   with other friends from school and with older boys who had cars.
   She dyed her hair and found a [parlor ] [that ][would ] [do ][piercing, ] [even ]
   though she was underage. [Her ] [mother ] [never ] [criticized ] [her ] [except ]
   to say that she would find [her ] [own ] [path ] [to ] [enlightenment. ] [This ]
   irritated Blossom Haven more than anything.
    She began to change a little when the war in Iraq started and
   then didn’t end when it was supposed to. Her mother made her
   go to San Francisco for protest marches, and being among more
   than a hundred thousand people chanting for peace moved her.
   She joined her mother doing yoga again, as she had when she was
   eight, and tried meditating on loving kindness, though she kept
   the nose rings and the dyed hair.
    She found herself liking Carter when she first had her hands
   on his face, spreading pancake and eyeliner. They hadn’t been out

    risk way to move things forward.
     Henry stayed in the Fury while Carter walked with Blossom
    Haven to the apartment on the second floor. The steps were poured
    concrete, and the walkway along the line of apartments was also con-
     crete, cracked in places. A series of identical lamps sprouted from the
    stucco wall down the walkway beside the metal doors of the apart-
    ments. They stopped in front of 14-8, and Blossom Haven turned.
     “Your grandpa’s cool,” she said.
      “Yeah.” Carter had his hands in his pockets and his elbows
    stuck out at awkward angles. He felt self-conscious of his height, at
     least eight inches taller than her. “I think Nu is too.”
     “Nu is the best.”
      “Yeah.”
      “Well. Thanks for the ride.”
     “No problem.”
      She took his hand in hers and swung it back and forth. “You’re
     shy,” she said.
     When Carter returned to the Fury, Henry raised his head.
    “You’re smiling,” he said.
      “Yeah.” He looked down, abashed.
      “That’s good. You should be smiling.” Henry lowered his head.
    “Before we go, call Katherine. Let’s see if we can locate her.”
      Carter pulled out his cell and tried calling his mother. She didn’t
    answer. He tried calling the house as well, but just got the answer-
    ing machine with Henry’s voice on it.
      “I don’t know,” Carter said.
      “Let’s drive home. I have a feeling she’s all right, wherever she is.”
      Carter drove along the commercial streets toward home. He
    thought there was an expressway that might be faster, but he wasn’t
    entirely confident about driving the expressway at night. He turned
     at the bowling alley scheduled for destruction and entered the subdi-
    vision. On Catesby Street, he passed the large house being built over
     the two teardowns. His grandfather’s house was dark, and the drive-
    way was empty. No Saturn. He didn’t know where his mother was.

    ( ne
  HEBER GRIMSHAW grew up in the town of Newcastle, in the
   high desert country of southern Utah, a little ways off the route
   tourists traveled between the great national parks, Zion and Bryce
   Canyon. Every July 24, they held a parade down the two-block
   business district to celebrate Pioneer Day, the date Brigham Young
   first looked down over the Salt Lake Valley from the mouth of
   Emigration Canyon and legendarily declared, “This is the right
   place,” a statement later shortened in common usage to “This is
   the place.”
    The parade in Newcastle was meager every year. The few dozen
   children from the town and the surrounding ranches dressed up
   in costumes of the nineteenth-century Mormon pioneers—jeans,
   checked shirts and suspenders, and cowboy hats for the boys, and
   poke bonnets and gingham dresses with long sleeves for the girls—
   and either rode down the street in the backs of pickup trucks that
   had been hosed out the night before or, if lucky, rode on a wagon
   pulled by a team of horses. The only audience was their parents
   and grandparents and older brothers [and ] [sisters, ] [and ] [sometimes ]
   the children waving outnumbered [those ] [standing ] [and ] [taking ] [pic- ]
   tures and waving back. The [parade ] [ended ] [after ] [a ] [few ] [hundred ]
   yards in front of the church at the center of town.
    At the county seat or in the university town not too far away,
   there were more elaborate parades, sometimes with replicas of the
   covered wagons being pulled by oxen, sometimes with men push-
   ing handcarts in honor of the pioneers who, without draft animals,
   loaded up all their belongings in rude, oversize wheelbarrows and
   pushed them across the Great Plains all the way to the Salt Lake
   Valley in 1856. But the people of Newcastle never considered doing
   without their own parade to attend a more elaborate one twenty miles
   away. It was necessary for their place, no matter how humble, to be

```

```
    every Pioneer Day it became their own lovely Deseret, the land
    vouchsafed to them by the Lord. And it was necessary every year
    for the children to act out the same roles their parents and grand-
    parents did. Not just to help them understand the past, as some-
    thing distant and closed off, but to literally claim the land again,
    understand it as promised to them, understand it as their own
    sacred ground. This is the right place. This is your family’s ground,
    and families are forever, and now this is your place too.
    When the boys were nineteen, after a year of college or a year
    of full-time work after high school, they were called to a mission
    and sent to the Missionary Training Center. In two weeks if State-
    side, longer if they needed to learn a language, the boys with dusty
    jeans and shit on their boots were transformed into scrubbed,
    short-haired, dark-suited personages, wearing a nameplate that
    designated them Elder. For two years, they shared the Word in a
    place far from home, forbidden even from calling on the telephone
    except on rare occasions. But Newcastle knew that its missionar-
     ies would return to it, marry local girls, and within a decade be
    watching their own children riding in truck beds down South First
    Street. The bond had been forged.
     Heber’s voice was long and mellow, a storytelling voice that
    painted pictures and put those around him in the scene he
    described. He was telling Katherine about his hometown and where
    he’d come from while they were both in bed together, naked yet
    modest with the sheets drawn up around their chests. The mattress
    was thin at the El Rancho Motel, and the coverlet was stiff and
    shiny and creased where they had folded it back, a dark purple pat-
    tern on the top and white quilting on the bottom. They’d left a sin-
    gle light on in the room, a brass table lamp on the Formica-topped
    lowboy at the foot of the bed, and Katherine watched Heber’s face
     as he talked about where he came from, his life before Silicon Val-
    ley. With his glasses off, it was a handsome face—not model hand-
    some, but intelligent and animated—and as he talked, he looked out
    beyond the cheap prints hanging on the walls and brought distant

   pressed herself against him, even though they had made love twice.
   She knew he was a little afraid to gaze at her, unaccustomed to the
   intimacy of two bodies lying together, and she excused him for his
   inexperience. She was happy to be lying with him, listening to him
   talk about himself. She had been talking about herself, her family,
   her husband, her problems, all night long. She was glad now to let
   him talk, his shyness softened in talk about Utah.
   They had arrived together at the El Rancho in Katherine’s Sat-
   urn a little before sunset and parked across the street alongside a
   chain-link fence that enclosed rental equipment for construction—
   Bobcats, backhoes, trailers, sitting out on cracked blacktop. The
   motel walls were burnt-orange stucco, showy and cheap in the late
   light, and the neon sign was already lit up, a yellow lariat loop-
   ing around the motel’s name. Below, there was a sign that read
   No Vacancy in script, but only the word Vacancy was lit. Katherine
   sat behind the steering wheel and watched. She told Heber she
   wanted to do surveillance for a little while, but as they watched she
   realized it was a silly idea.
    Heber was quiet beside her, waiting for her to decide what to
   do. She swung the car door open. “Come on. Let’s go see what we
   can find out.”
    The motel office was linoleum floored and walled with knotty
   pine, and on the elbow-high counter a little plaque read “Wel-
   come.” Katherine waited for a moment. Behind the counter, a com-
   puter screen was on, and she could see it displayed a webpage with
   writing in an alphabet she didn’t recognize.
    A front-door buzzer was screwed onto the counter, and she
  pushed it and heard it sound behind a closed door. In a moment,
   a Sikh man came out, wearing a turban and a large and luxuriant
   beard tucked away.
    “Madame and Monsieur would like a room for the night?” he
   asked.

```

-----

```
     “Ah, but why? When you have found each other?” He smiled
    and bowed at Heber. His English was strange and affected, as
    though he had learned it from old black-and-white movies set in
    New York with men in tuxedos and women in ballroom gowns and
    French headwaiters.
     Katherine flopped her purse down on the counter. She was
    carrying her big purse tonight, a large red leather bag with a zip-
    pered center section and two outside open pockets. She carried the
    big purse for some weeks, gradually filling it with makeup, pens,
    notebooks, gum, coin purses, plastic key chains, candy, coupons,
    paperback books, until one day she realized that it weighed as
    much as a standard poodle, and she threw things out and went to a
    clutch. The clutch lasted a couple of weeks until it grew too small,
    and then she went to a midsize purse before ending up again with
    her big purse.
     She began pawing through the purse while the Sikh man smiled
    politely, clasping his hands behind his back and rocking back and
    forth on his heels. At last, she brought forth a small leather folder
    with a snap clasp holding it shut. She unloosed a plastic accordion
    of photos and searched them for a good likeness of her husband.
      “There’s a trip to the Boardwalk,” she muttered. “Yosemite. Disney-
    land, Christ, that was ten years ago. Napa. . .” She kept up a running
    commentary on her family photos, while the Sikh man looked on
    with polite interest, as though sharing memories of past vacations
    with utter strangers was nothing out of the ordinary. Heber looked
    away, embarrassed, as she continued to flip through them.
     Katherine was frustrated. The problem was that Scott had so
    often handled the camera that there were far more photos of her
    and Betty and Carter than there were of Scott. The ones with Scott
    tended to be group photos, taken by a stranger, and his face was
    small and smudged and indistinct. How could she tell anyone what
    he really looked like, or all the bad and good things he’d been in
    twenty years, or why she now had to find a way to get rid of him
    forever?

    five years ago and sold last year to avoid bankruptcy. Both smiling
   and optimistic. Look! the picture said. We’ve made it! We’re home!
   The photo made her furious. She didn’t realize she’d still been car-
   rying it around in her two-ton purse.
    “Look at him.” She slipped the photo out of its plastic cover and
   rapped Scott’s face with her knuckles. “Just look at him. I can’t
   believe it.”
    The Sikh bent over and inspected the photo. “He seems like a
   most pleasant gentleman,” he said.
     “Pleasant. Pleasant? You don’t know what he’s done to me.”
    Heber touched Katherine’s arm and looked at the manager.
    “T think what she’d like to know is whether you recognize him.
   Whether he is someone you’ve seen before, whether he is staying
    at your motel.”
     “Ah. You’re seeking information about him. His whereabouts.”
   He used the word with great satisfaction, knowing it to be pre-
   cisely the one called for.
     “Yes. Exactly.” Heber looked at Katherine, who was staring
   again at the photo. He was a little afraid of her, as though she were
    a bomb about to go off.
    The manager leaned over and inspected the photograph care-
    fully. He made a series of little noises to himself, bmms and ahs and
   clickings of the tongue. Finally, he straightened up.
     “No,” he said.
    “No?” Heber asked. “You’ve never seen him?”
     “No. I cannot give you any information about any of our guests.
   We are a discreet establishment, you understand. Discreet. The pri-
   vacy of our guests is paramount.”
    “So if he is staying here, you wouldn’t say?” Heber asked.
     “That is correct, Monsieur.”
    “What? What?” Katherine looked up. “You let me show you all
   this crap, and you won’t tell me anything?”
    The manager bowed with a smile of sad understanding and

      “{ don’t believe it.’ She looked at the manager like she wanted
     to strangle him. “Money? Do you want money?”
     The manager pursed his lips. “You lower yourself, Madame, in
    making an offer I could never accept.”
     Heber took her gently by the arm and drew her backward
    toward the door. “Come on. We'll look someplace else.”
     “Where did he come from? Mars?”
     They had backed out the door when Katherine realized that the
    one photo of her and Scott was still on the counter. She bolted for-
    ward just as they were stepping off the cement walk, and Heber’s
    foot twisted, caught between two levels. He felt his ankle turn, and
    he went down on one knee.
     Back in the office, Katherine snatched the photo from the
    counter and lifted her nose at the manager. When she turned, she
    saw Heber getting up and beginning to limp around, trying his
    weight on the ankle.
     “Ha ha,” she called back to the manager. “Maybe we'll just sue
    you, huh? Maybe we can sue you!”
     She stalked out. Beyond the cyclone fences and the tall,
    tough-leafed shrubs that were intended as a sound break, the free-
    way roared and grew illuminated as night fell and the hurrying
    cars switched on shafts of light and the billboards that lined the
    winding blacktop began to glow.
     Katherine rested herself against the front fender of the Sat-
    urn and let the noise and weight of the freeway press against her
    back. Heber limped after her. He wasn’t used to seeing a woman
    so angry. He had never seen a woman act like Katherine. In New-
    castle, even in Salt Lake City, women tended to find a way to
    make the best of things. When life gives you lemons, his mother
    used to say, make lemonade. And the girls he had dated in high
    school, or the few women he had gone out with in college or just
    after, before he left Utah, tended to be demure types who cast
    their eyes down and gave him to understand that his wishes were
    what mattered most.

   reflections from the flood lamps above the warehouse yards, her
   head slumped a bit as though tired from anger, and he wondered
    if all women had this anger inside them, and those he had known
   back home, even those who waited for their missionary boyfriends
    to return and got married in the temple two months later, were
   simply very good at hiding it.
    Katherine was hiding nothing. He felt like he needed to protect
   her in some way, to keep her anger from causing her harm.
    “How’s your ankle?” she asked as he slow-walked to the car.
     “It’s been better.”
     “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for you to hurt yourself helping me.”
     “It’s okay. I’m happy to be here for you.”
    “Thanks.” She lifted her head. “Come on. I’ll buy you dinner.”
     Near the freeway exit, Katherine had seen a Mexican restaurant
    called El Salto, which she assumed was named for the salt on the
   rim of the margarita glasses. If Scott had stayed at the El Rancho
    for a number of weeks, she was sure he would have eaten at El
   Salto often, maybe every night. They had always liked the Tampico
   Kitchen in Santa Cruz, liked getting an order of nachos con todo
   and a pitcher of margaritas and then some plate rich with avocado,
    cheese, sour cream, rice and beans, salsa. It didn’t matter so much
   what else was on the plate. She thought about Scott’s weird sense
   of nostalgia, obvious even in the little time she’d seen him, and she
   knew he would not have been [able ] [to ] [pass ] [up ] [evenings ] [at ] [El ][Salto, ]
   the warmth of alcohol and reveries.
     Inside, the restaurant was decorated for Christmas, with strings
   of colored lights around the ceiling and garlands of sparkling tinsel
   draped around the walls, silver, green, metallic blue. Behind the
   bar, big cardboard letters hung in arcs in front of the mirror, spell-
   ing Feliz Navidad above the golden bottles of tequila. The walls of
   the restaurant were splashed with different colors, golden yellow,
    cactus green, aquamarine, and Katherine and Heber were given a
   booth under a Mexican flag. An old-fashioned Wurlitzer jukebox,
   luminescent, played ranchero music nonstop.

```
    opalescent snap buttons. He introduced himself in perfect En-
    glish when they sat down. “I’m Luis Reyes, and I’ll be your server
    tonight.”
     Katherine took charge, ordering a plate of nachos con todo and
    a pitcher of margaritas without asking Heber what he wanted. The
    restaurant wasn’t busy, and Luis quickly brought out a tall, frothy
    pitcher beading with condensation and two glasses rimmed with
     salt. He poured two glasses expertly and set the pitcher back down.
    Heber picked up his glass and looked at it doubtfully, while Kath-
    erine took a quick sip and motioned Luis to wait for a moment.
    She hauled her big purse out onto the table and slipped the photo
    from a side pocket and spread it flat.
     “Do you recognize this man?” She tapped Scott’s face. “He was
    staying nearby and must have come in a few times.”
     “Where was he staying?” Luis picked up the photo and held it
     to the light.
     “The El Rancho.”
     “That fleabag?” He smiled, delighted. “Who is he?”
     “My husband.”
     “Oh.” He looked at Heber. “So why are you looking for him?”
     Katherine took a drink from her margarita. “So I can divorce him.”
     “Wow. Cool.” Luis gazed at her with pure admiration. His par-
    ents owned the restaurant, and he had been working there most
    of his life, but he had just begun as a freshman at Stanford and
    was taking a course entitled California Noir: From Hammet to
    Didion and Beyond. They had been reading Mildred Pierce, about a
   woman who divorces her husband and starts a restaurant and then
    takes a broke aristocrat as a lover. The aristocrat ends up running
    away with the woman’s daughter, who has become a famous opera
    singer, leaving the woman to get stinko drunk with her ex-husband.
    Luis loved the class, even though it had nothing to do with the busi-
    ness degree his parents wanted him to get, and he’d been think-
    ing that nothing all that exciting ever happened at El Salto. His
    parents’ restaurant wasn’t noir enough. But now, a woman with a

   of a James M. Cain novel! Maybe they really intended to murder
   her husband, or blackmail him, or maybe they were secret lovers.
   Maybe it was sordid. Luis loved that word. Sordid.
    He affected a knowing look. “I’ll take the photo around to the
   boys and get some info.”
    Katherine sipped her drink and smiled at Heber. “Go on, take a
   taste. It’s good.”
    “Okay.” Heber never drank. It was part of his Mormon upbring-
   ing that he hadn’t ever wanted to upend, even though he knew
   that some Mormons who stopped practicing became ostentatious
   drinkers, especially those who remained in Utah. Jack Mormons,
   who used drink like a badge to prove they had left the church. He
   sipped cautiously, afraid he would be drunk with one taste. The
   salt on the rim grained pleasantly across his tongue, and then the
   taste was fruity with lime.
    “Nice,” he said.
    “Good.” Katherine grasped the pitcher and refilled her own glass.
    Luis brought out the plate of nachos con todo, carrying it with a
   towel and warning them that the plate was hot. He told Katherine
   in a half whisper that he was making inquiries and he’d have some
   straight dope for her pronto. They ordered combination plates and
   pulled at the nachos while they waited, taking gobs of cheese, salsa,
   refried beans with every chip. Heber took one mouthful of sliced
   jalapeno peppers and gasped it out onto his plate, half chewed.
   Katherine laughed as he gulped down water, and she offered that
   a frozen margarita is especially good at putting out jalapeno fires.
    As they ate and drank, her more than him, she began to talk
   about Scott, her husband, [her ] [soon ] [to ] [be ] [ex-husband. ] [The ] [things ]
   about him that had first attracted [her ] [to ] [him: ] [his ] [endless ] [sense ] [of ]
   being special, of being [certain ] [that ] [he—and ] [therefore ] [she—was ]
   destined for something [glamorous. ] [That ] [California ] [dream, ] [of ]

    spring, as if they owned it. That was it, as if they owned it, instead
    of being just two more workers in Silicon Valley, in midsize com-
    panies that were not going to go public in a splash of instant mil-
    lions and champagne. And she saw how he grew more desperate
     as he passed forty, he grew more desperate and he grew more
    needy, and he looked increasingly to the past even as their son,
    Carter, was having problems. It was a kind of nostalgia he had, she
    thought, but not a nostalgia for anything they ever really possessed.
    A nostalgia for the life he had dreamed they might have someday,
    rather. He’d lost their money, and that was partly her fault. She’d
    been willing to let him deal with things like that and had signed
    papers she didn’t understand. And he’d lost their house, and that
    was partly her fault as well, since she’d let herself be convinced
    that they could afford that beautiful house with the cathedral ceil-
    ings and the gourmet kitchen with the trophy stove. And he’d lost
     his job, and that really wasn’t his fault, since a lot of people in
     a lot of companies lost their jobs that year in Silicon Valley. But
    choosing to run away, go on board a ship in the Arabian Sea, a job
    he hadn’t done since he was in his early twenties? That was crazy.
    He wasn’t twenty-two anymore—he was almost fifty. And it wasn’t
    World War II, and he should just understand it. He was caught, he
    was trying to relive a past, and it wasn’t even his own past. There
    was something messed up about that.
      “He’s gone crazy. And he wants me to enable him. But ’'m
    through being an enabler. I’ve been enabling him for twenty years.
     I’ve enabled enough.”
      Their food came, again with a warning that it was hot, and
    Katherine immediately shoved a forkful of beans and rice in her
    mouth. She drank more of her margarita.
     “You know what really sucks? That I don’t even know what I
    wanted before I met him.” She was speaking with her mouth full,
    but she didn’t realize it. “I don’t remember! I don’t remember!”
      Listening to Katherine, Heber felt he wanted to protect her, soothe
     her, heal her, but he didn’t have a clue how to do it. He had never

  nodded and agreed with her when it seemed like that’s what she
   needed. He had a desire to lay hands on her and give her a bless-
   ing. But he wasn’t in Utah, would never again be in Utah in that
   sense, within the comforting strictures and precepts of the church,
   even though he had never truly stopped believing. He could only
   improvise his comfort and healing out of his own capacities and
   limited experience.
    “What should we do, Katherine?” he asked. “I don’t think Scott
   is coming here tonight.”
    Luis Reyes brought their bill over in a padded wallet, and he
   kneeled down close to Katherine’s side of the booth. “I’ve got the
  lowdown,” he said. “Interested?”
    “Sure,” she said, leaning toward him a little sloppily. “What’s
   the scoop?”
    “The party in question was a regular for a month solid. Three
   or four nights a week. Number 6, Burrito Jalisco and a bottle of
   Corona with a slice of lime. Fair tipper.”
    “See?” Katherine said to Heber. “I told you.”
    “But where is he now?” Heber asked.
    “The only bar nearby is Darlene’s,” Luis said. “One of the boys
   heard him say once he was heading there for a nightcap.”
    “Good work.” Katherine slipped her Visa card inside the wallet.
   “You'll find the tip to your liking. Share it with the boys.”
    Luis doffed an imaginary hat to her and took the check. Kather-
   ine stood up, feeling warm [but ][not ] [wobbly ][on ] [her ][feet. ] [She ] [realized ]
   that she had been accusing [Scott ] [of ][living ] [in ] [the ] [past, ] [convicting ]
  him in absentia of hollow [nostalgia. ] [Yet ] [she ] [herself ] [was ] [reliving ]
   the past, out for Mexican [comfort ] [food ] [and ] [drinking ] [enough ] [to ]
  know it and talking about [herself ] [and ] [feeling ] [the ][person ] [across ] [the ]
   table was interested [in ] [her. ] [She ] [could ] [feel ] [new ] [and ] [enchanting, ]
  new to Heber at least. And [now ] [they ][were ] [going ] [to ] [a ] [bar ] [together. ]
   Reliving the past wasn’t [so ] [bad. ] [Maybe ] [she ] [liked ] [it. ]
    “You coming?” she asked.
    Heber felt the need to protect her grow.

    Darlene’s was a small blues bar with low ceilings and painted green
    walls decorated with neon beer signs and tattered posters of old
     blues acts and cardboard record covers. The bar itself was rich green
    marble, while the barstools were cheap steel with vinyl seat covers
    patched with cloth tape. The floor was carpeted, and even years after
    smoking was outlawed in public places in California, it seemed to
    exhale an odor of warm tobacco and nicotine. Darlene’s still smelled
     like a bar and seemed comfortable with that. On Thursdays, a single
    blues singer accompanying himself on the guitar took the stage,
    covering songs that most of the patrons would know by heart—“T’d
    Rather Drink Muddy Water, Sleep Out in a Hollow Log”—and when
    he went on break, the bartender played cps over the sound system
     or occasionally vinyl from the owner’s collection.
      The first thing Heber noticed when he and Katherine walked in was
     that they were the only white people there. In Newcastle, he had grown
    up surrounded by white people, and in Salt Lake City, he found himself
     staring when he saw a black person. Then he would feel embarrassed
     for staring and would train his eyes on the sidewalk beyond the person
     so that he wouldn’t have to make eye contact. He hated that he couldn’t
     act naturally around other human beings. When he moved to Califor-
     nia, it took months for him to accustom himself to the regular presence
    of people from all races and many countries, to see and greet them all
     equally. He thought he finally managed it. But he couldn’t remember
    being in a situation where 4e was the minority, where he had to worry
    about others seeing him equally.
      Several people turned to look at them as they paused on the bar’s
    threshold, then went back to their conversations. The regulars
    were used to white blues fans dropping in.
     Heber touched Katherine’s arm. He felt his smile was unnatu-
     rally wide. “I don’t see Scott here,” he said.
      “Well, we’re going to have at least one drink,” Katherine said. “A
    vodka tonic. It will cool your mouth down after the Mexican food.”
     They sat down at a table adjoining the dance floor, a small square
     of parquet cut into the carpeting. Nobody was dancing. The singer

  blouse loose over her hips, and Katherine ordered two vodka ton-
   ics, on the rocks, with lime.
   “Top shelf?” the waitress asked.
    “Sure. Top shelf. We deserve it.”
    Heber’s ankle still hurt. He thought he might have sprained it.
   RICE: rest, ice, compression, elevation. That’s what he needed. But he
   didn’t want to leave Katherine’s side. He had let her drink more of the
  margaritas because he was unused to drink and because he had fanta-
   sies of protecting her. That’s how he thought he could serve her best,
  by being ready to protect her. It was a gallant, chivalric notion, though
   in Darlene’s it seemed utterly stupid. What was he doing to protect her
  here besides sitting with a big stupid smile on his face to show that he
  was a nice man and thought well of each and every person he saw?
  But he was glad to let her down three-fourths of the pitcher anyway.
   It didn’t make her drunk and sloppy—it made her ardent, vehement,
  and reckless in a way that he found fascinating. Now that they were
   seated, he was looking forward to having another drink, to see what
   she would be like afterward. He began to wonder why her husband
  had been stupid enough to run off and expect her to be waiting.
    He leaned forward across the small round table. Katherine
  leaned in to listen.
    “I don’t know why your husband would be stupid enough to
  run off and expect you to be waiting,” he said.
    Katherine smiled. “That’s a sweet thing to say.”
    The waitress brought their drinks on a round plastic tray, brown
  with a layer of cork in it. She looked at Heber, waiting. Heber
  looked back at her and smiled broadly. She put a hand on her hip
  and turned down a corner of her mouth.
    “Qh,” he said. “Sorry.” He fumbled out his wallet and paid for
   the drinks and added a big tip.
    “There you go,” he said.
    The singer called the waitress over, and she nodded at Heber
  and left the table. Katherine lifted her drink toward Heber, and
   after a moment he lifted his as well, and they touched glasses. She

     On the small platform that served as a bandstand, the singer
     leaned into his mike. “We’re going [to ] [have ] [Ruby ][here ] [sing ][one ] [that ]
     the great Koko Taylor sang last time she was in town.”
      He began to lay down a twelve-bar blues rhythm, and the wait-
     ress, who had put down her tray and picked up a microphone,
    swayed with the music. She let the rhythm repeat itself and then
    began a song about a woman who didn’t care much if other women
     were sneaking around her husband, since he was just a husband.
     But she wouldn’t put up with anyone sneaking around her man.
      Halfway through the song, Shirelle Jones walked over to Kath-
     erine and Heber’s table. Shirelle was a mean, complaining woman
    who was always convinced that others had it better than her. Other
     people had better jobs, better lovers, better cars. Other people were
     having a better time than her. They always had something to laugh
     about and someone to laugh with. And she knew, for someone to
     be having such a good time, they must be doing something wrong.
     She had decided that if a person was acting right, they would be
     just as miserable as she was.
      She frequently sat down at a table of white people, skinny and
    wearing a dress that tightened over her flat chest, and talked a
     drink out of them. She was sure they were doing better than she
     was, and if they were, the least they could do is buy her a Long
     Island iced tea. Darlene and Ruby and the other cocktail wait-
     resses knew Shirelle, knew how she acted, knew what she drank.
    They let her act out because it didn’t seem to bother the custom-
     ers. Some of them even liked it, judging by the tips and the liquor
    downed.
      Shirelle sat down at the table without asking and looked at
     Katherine and Heber. “Hey,” she said.
      “Hey yourself,” Katherine said.
      Heber said nothing at all, just smiled at Shirelle. He didn’t think
     about asking her what the hell she was doing at their table. It
     wouldn’t be polite, and she might think he didn’t want her at his
     table because she was black.

```

```
   “Hmmmpf.” Shirelle snorted as though she knew they would
  be drinking something like that. “Hey. You two are sneaking,
   aren’t you?”
    “What?” Katherine asked.
    “You two are sneaking.” Shirelle said it as a statement, not a
   question this time.
    “No, we’re not sneaking.”
    “He’s not your husband, is he?”
    nNOS’
    “I knew that. I knew that from across the room.”
    “That doesn’t mean we’re sneaking.”
   “Hmmmpf.” She looked at their vodka tonics. Katherine’s was
  below half, but Heber’s had just been sipped on. She began to tell them
   the story of the last time she’d been sneaking, when she was stepping
   out with a married man, a man who had little ones at home. “Little
   ones at home! And did I care? No!” She knew it was going to end bad,
   and it did end bad, and she was the one who was treated mean.
    The waitress Ruby was singing another song. Shirelle glared at
   her, but Ruby ignored her. Shirelle thought that when Ruby was
   up there singing, it was just her trying to be someone she wasn’t.
  Ruby was never going to be Koko Taylor. Now Shirelle, she knew
   she wasn’t going to be Koko Taylor, and didn’t pretend otherwise.
    She turned back to Katherine. “But when you’re sneaking, it’s
   the sweetest thing there [is. ] That’s [what ] [you ] [got ] [to ] [know. ] [You ] [two ]
   need another drink.”
    Heber covered his glass with his hand. “I’m fine,” he said.
    Shirelle shook her head in disgust. “You two need another drink,
   and I need one too. Why don’t you order us one?”
    “Okay.” Katherine waved toward the bar. She was enjoying lis-
   tening to Ruby sing, listening to the blues in a kind of bar she
   hadn’t been to in twenty years, enjoying the way the drink made
   her feel, and enjoying sitting across the table from Heber. She
  was even enjoying listening to Shirelle rant about how life always
   treated her like shit.

     of iced tea, with a wedge of lemon. Katherine gave her thirty and
     told her to keep the change. Darlene said thanks. She walked back
     to the bar, shaking her head.
      “Now, you see, he don’t want to drink, and he got to drink.” She
     pointed at Heber, sitting back from his two vodka tonics.
     “Why does he have to drink?” Katherine asked.
      “Because you want him to get up and take you by the hand and
     take you out to that dance floor, even though nobody else dancing,
     and put his arms around you and dance you around. And he ain’t
     doing it unless he’s drinking.”
      She looked at Katherine and smiled meanly.
      Partly to prove Shirelle wrong, Katherine stood up and took Heber
    by the hand and led him to the dance floor. He surprised her by hold-
     ing her with confidence, a hand on her hip, leading gracefully.
     “Where did you learn to dance?” she asked over the music.
      “Ballroom is big in Utah. In a lot of wards, they have a ballroom
     night once a week. Fox-trot. Rumba. Waltz. I also learned square
    dancing in Newcastle.”
     “Wow.” Katherine looked at Heber’s face as they glided around,
     in a dance not right for the music being played. He looked happy
     now, confident, in a way that he hadn’t since they left the office.
    He looked happy to have her in his arms. Her specifically, not
     just anyone, but her. She felt special, even though as she thought
     that she knew it sounded like a cliché. He makes me feel special. It
    sounded like an item from a list in Seventeen magazine, “Ten Ways
     to Know If He’s the One.”
      But she did—she felt special.
      He looked happy. She thought that if this were a movie, she’d
    know just what would happen next. She’d take his face in her
     hands and kiss him, right there on the dance floor, and even
    though they had stopped twirling, the room would still seem to be
     twirling about them.
      If this were a movie. But what did it matter? She didn’t care that
     it wasn’t a movie. And she didn’t care that she would be acting as if

    Then the song ended. Heber took his hands off her and
  applauded Ruby and the guitarist. Katherine was dazed suddenly.
  Her mind wasn’t working well at thinking. Heber turned to go
  back to their table, and Katherine’s mouth suddenly seemed unable
   to express simple thoughts.
    She grabbed his hand. “N-n-n-no,” she stammered. “S-s-stay.”
    The blues singer began another song, and Katherine waited for
   his left hand on her hip, and then she felt as though it belonged
   exactly there. And they danced, and when she felt ready she took
   her hand from his and stroked his cheek and rose up to him and
   kissed him on the lips, once quickly, and then a second time as she
   felt him understand and put his arms around her. She closed her
   eyes and felt the room twirling.
   “Hmmmpf. I knew that was coming,” Shirelle said to herself.
  “And she said they wasn’t sneaking? Hmmmpf.” She sipped her
   drink. She’d been right. And she’d gotten her Long Island iced tea.
   It had been a good night.
    Katherine drove them back to the El Rancho Motel. Home
  seemed impossible, with her fifteen-year-old and her father in bed-
   rooms on either side of her own, and Heber lived more than an
  hour away. And the El Rancho [was ] [close, ] [and ] [it ][seemed ] [important ]
   not to delay, important to hurry. [Any ][delay ][might ][upset ] [everything, ]
   so that what she wanted to happen wouldn't.
    The No in front of the Vacancy was still unlit when they pulled
   into the lot beside the office. As they stepped out of the car, the
   neon lariat that bordered the sign flashed on and off, washing their
   faces with a cheap yellow light before leaving them darkened again.
   The Sikh manager was delighted to see them, smiled as though he
  had expected them all along. Katherine asked for a room as Heber
   hovered near the door. The manager complimented them on their
  good sense in patronizing his motel and stated in a pleased way that
   they had taken the last vacant room. He handed Katherine a key on
   a long diamond-shaped piece of plastic that had the motel’s address
   on it and requested anyone who found it to drop it in a mailbox.

```
      “Not for spying,” Katherine said.
     Katherine was delighted with the kitschy sleaziness of the motel.
    She pointed out the way the No light flickered when it came on in
     front of Vacancy, the concrete steps crumbling a little at the corners
     on the way up to the second floor. She had not seen a motel key
     like this one for decades. It reminded her of family driving vaca-
     tions in the early seventies, when the goal was to get to the motel
     in time to use the swimming pool. She began to think she had mar-
     ried too early. She should have had more flings like this one. Her
    daughter was having a time, living in Aptos. So Betty was peeling
    shrimp? So what? Betty was having a time. Katherine thought she
    deserved one too.
     Heber nodded at the tawdry aspects of the motel as Katherine
    pointed them out to him. He didn’t understand why he was sup-
    posed to find them amusing, but he didn’t want to admit it. He
    wanted to play along, act cool, act like he knew what he was doing.
    But he was terrified. He didn’t know how to admit to Katherine
     that he was a virgin.
      In southern Utah, in his community, premarital sex was rare
    and shameful. Young people worried about hitting the big Two-O
    while still single, and they seized on each other to escape into the
    haven of marriage, within which decisions about sex could be
     safely made. Even those who were engaged held off, since the big
     event of their lives, a temple wedding, required that they be pure.
     If a wedding wasn’t held in the temple, it could be taken as a tacit
    admission that the couple had fallen short of virtue.
     The time Heber spent on his mission, which should have solid-
     ified his testimony, had caused him to question the church, in part
    because of sex. One of his mission companions in Northwest Ohio,
     Elder Branson from Fayetteville, Arkansas, had confessed to him
     that he was afraid of being a homosexual. Heber tried to convince
    him that it was just a stage, that they were all having trouble, that
    he thought that everyone, including himself, had called the mis-
     sion president at one time or another to confess to masturbating.

```

-----

```
   that it was different for him. He had to fight every day to act as
   he knew he ought to. He knew that if he controlled his behavior,
   it wouldn’t matter what his thoughts were. But it shouldn’t be so
   hard to be good, should it? Shouldn’t being good seem natural and
   normal, as God intended?
    They had prayed together, and for the three months they went
   door-to-door as a pair, Elder Branson spoke with a fervor and pas-
   sion about the church that Heber had not seen in anyone else. And
   then they were rotated to other companions. The missionaries were
   not supposed to become more attached to each other than to the
   scriptures. After their missions were completed, Heber received a let-
   ter from Elder Branson telling him that he had gotten engaged to be
   married just three weeks after returning home. The church had spon-
   sored a social where young people could meet others of the faith, and
   he had found her there. Elder Branson expressed wonder and awe
   that he had found someone who would have him as her husband.
   The church was true. His testimony was strong. In the letter, he said
   that he was writing Heber first among all his mission companions,
   because he felt closest to him. And Heber remembered the confes-
   sion Elder Branson had made and heard an undercurrent of wishful
   desperation in his expressions of wonder at his bride-to-be.
    After his mission, Heber finished a degree in information tech-
   nology and then moved to Silicon Valley, another valley about
  which it could be said “This is the place,” though without any
   notion of divine revelation. Heber [switched ] [jobs ] [several ] [times ] [in ]
   his first few years, floating [on ] [the ] [manic ] [energy ] [of ] [the ] [Internet ]
   arising from nothing, from [the ] [crackle ] [in ] [the ] [air, ] [from ] [Netscape, ]
   Hotbot, Yahoo, Google. From [the ] [notion ] [that ] [everything ] [you ] [knew ]
   before was ancient [history. ] [When ] [the ] [crash ] [came, ] [he ] [was ] [young ]
  enough to find a place [in ] [the ] [shrunken ] [job ][landscape, ] [not ] [one ] [of ]
   those middle managers [who ] [had ] [let ][their ][programming ] [skills ] [erode ]
   and now found themselves [on ] [the ] [outside. ]
    Heber lived chastely in California, uncertain what the shape of
   his life should be. He had isolated himself from the structures of

    and he didn’t know how to replace it.
      Katherine was opening the door of their motel room. The El
    Rancho. He would always remember this. He hadn’t expected his
     first sexual experience to be with his coworker Katherine. But
    now it seemed right, inevitable. He was comforted by the fact
     that she was more than ten years older than him. She was lead-
    ing him down a pathway she already knew—he wasn’t tricking
    her or seducing her or taking advantage of her. She was older, but
     she was passionate, and he found himself surprised and grateful
     that she was passionate for him. Ardent Katherine, vehement and
    passionate Katherine, with just a touch of the comforting mother
    attending her.
      Yet he was still terrified. He wasn’t ignorant of the physical act
     of sex. Even in Utah, there were soft-core films that were shown at
    bachelor parties, pornography with the most explicit parts edited
     out to keep them legal within the state. “Training films,” they were
    jokingly called. Available also to be piped discreetly into bridal
     suites, even in conservative Provo hotels. Yet now the knowledge
    he had seemed abstract, seemed to have nothing to do with the
     scary and shivering anticipation he felt.
     He couldn’t bring himself to admit to her his utter lack of expe-
     rience. He was a man, after all, and felt that pressure to project
    competence. He let her go first into the room and locked the door
    behind them. He looked at the dresser, the television, the venti-
     lation unit under the window next to the door. He looked at the
     prints on the wall of Mission Carmel, Mission Santa Barbara, the
    whitewashed adobe walls and red tile roofs and bells hanging
    within arched bell towers. The bed itself had a stiff green coverlet
    and a square Formica headboard. None of it seemed to displease
    Katherine, so he didn’t allow any reaction to show.
      He had decided to let her guide him, without letting on that he
    was being guided. “Let her set the pace”—that was a phrase that
     he’d heard somewhere, maybe at a bachelor party, maybe at one
     of those ward house gatherings where the young men clustered

```

-----

```
    “Tl let you set the pace,” he said. She smiled, and he felt he had
   said the right thing, felt smooth and debonair. Debonair, a word
   that, when he was nine, he and his friends would pronounce “De
   Boner” and laugh hysterically, even though they didn’t know why.
    She set a fast pace, eager and anxious. Fortunately for Heber’s
   self-confidence, since he knew nothing about attending to his part-
   ner’s wants and needs. It was all over quickly, before he really
   knew what was happening, and he was lying on his back with
   Katherine lying on top of him, soft and warm and molded to his
   body. He was embarrassed by her telling him that she had to pee.
   No woman had ever used those words in his presence before. But
   when she returned, without him willing it, he felt himself become
   ready again, and he saw pleasure in Katherine’s eyes. And she
   guided him more slowly, a second time, to the same place again.
    Afterward, he lay back and covered his face with both hands.
   He felt shame, he couldn’t help himself from feeling shame, and
   looking at Katherine would have made it worse. He knew it wasn’t
   fair to her to feel that way, and it might make her feel awful to
   know that he wouldn’t look at her and why, but it felt easier for
   him to close his eyes, to cover his face, to look at nothing for the
   time, not even the dim outlines visible in the half light reflecting
   from the bathroom.
    Katherine cuddled up next to him. At first, when they undressed,
   she found herself wishing she could lose ten pounds before she
   was completely naked, but then [she ] [had ] [forgotten ] [about ] [her ] [age ]
   or how she looked, and she [felt ][wonderful. ] [She ] [pressed ] [her ] [cheek ]
   up against his chest. It wasn’t [a ] [bad ] [chest, ] [a ] [little ] [bony ][toward ] [the ]
   clavicles, but broad enough, [hairy ][and ] [masculine. ] [She ] [rested ] [there ]
   for a minute and then [noticed ] [Heber ] [covering ] [his ] [face. ]
    “Hey,” she said. “Peek-a-boo.” She tried to peel his palm from
   his cheek.
    “I’m sorry,” he said.
    “What? You have nothing to apologize for.”
    iNos Lis.

      “D’ve never done this before.”
     “Been in a sleazy motel room with an older woman?”
      “No,” Heber said. “This.”
     This?
     vest This?2
      “This,” Katherine said it as a statement.
      “This?”
     “Wow.” Katherine didn’t think she’d ever been with a virgin
    before. The boy she’d lost her own virginity to in high school had
    some experience. Not enough, that was certain, but some. Enough
    experience to please himself, but not her.
     She had thought of this as a fling, but now she saw that to
    Heber, it was all very serious, an event of substance and gravity.
    She felt bad, as though she had taken something from him.
     “Hey,” she said. “Are you crying?”
     “No,” he said. “It’s just not what I’d imagined it would be.”
      “But it’s okay, isn’t it? Whatever we do isn’t what we imagined we’d
    do. We’re all failures in some way. Here.” She settled down alongside
    him. “Why don’t you tell me what you imagined? Tell me about your-
     self. You don’t have to look at me. But I’ll be right here. You’ve been
    listening to me talk about myself all night long. Your turn.”
     She tugged gently at his hands again, and he slid them off his
    face and smiled at her sadly. Then he looked up at the ceiling,
    white plaster mixed with asbestos.
     “Something sacred, I guess.”
     “Sacred?”
      “That’s how I was taught. I haven’t thought that way for a long
     time, but it sticks with you.”
      “Tell me about it,” Katherine said. “I want to know about you.”
      So he began talking, about Newcastle, about being one of the
    kids in the Pioneer Day Parade, the parade that lets every per-
    son say “This is the place” for themselves. Then being one of the
    returned missionaries watching the next generation and feeling
    the expectations that he would take part in the same story as his

```
   begun to think that the point of mission service was not only to
   win converts to the church, but also to win the young missionaries
   themselves and bind them to the church once and for all.
    He told her about Elder Branson and the night they prayed
   together. A few years later, while still in Utah, he received a letter from
   Elder Branson. He had split up with his wife and was being excom-
   municated. He knew now he was gay, and he hoped the church would
   have a place for him someday. He apologized to Heber if he’d ever
   tempted him in any way, as that had never been his intention. The last
   time Heber wrote to him, in 2002 at Christmas, Elder Branson was
   living in New Orleans, happier, but missing his two daughters terribly.
     In his long storytelling voice, he told her about his time in Salt
   Lake and his move west. His mother called him a hippie. That’s the
   only category she had for someone who moved to California and
   drifted away from the church—as though working in a tech firm
   was like wearing love beads and tie-dyed T-shirts.
    “When I was a boy,” he said, “my mother told me there was an
   angel standing outside our door, to protect us at night. Now, there
    is no angel outside my door. Sometimes, I miss that angel.”
    He told her he didn’t know how he would find love, once he left
   the church’s social customs of courtship. He didn’t know how to
   look. He didn’t know what it would look like. And maybe he hoped
   love would find him. There would be a sign, a vision, a revelation.
    “And instead there was just me,” Katherine said. “Forty-seven,
   and ten pounds overweight, and over the hill.”
    “No.” He put his arm around her. “You’re beautiful. You’re just
   who you should be. Maybe it says something about me, that I couldn’t
   imagine this.”
    “Hey,” Katherine said. “Maybe Shirelle was an angel.”
    “Maybe so,” Heber said. “Funny angel.”
    “Fond of Long Island iced tea.”
    “Yeah.” He looked at Katherine. “Maybe this is the place.”
     “Tt’s not so bad.” Katherine put a hand over his brow and stroked
   an eyebrow with one thumb, slowly and thoughtfully.

    5
    EVERY MORNING, at his mother’s house in Henderson, Nevada,
    Scott took a cup of coffee and sat in one of the squat brown leather
    armchairs in the living room and waited for his mother and her
    husband to leave. He tried to be as inconspicuous as possible, sip-
    ping his coffee quietly, making himself small beside the large pot-
    ted ferns that sat on the floor amid the furniture. He hated to be
    noticed. His mother would ask him brightly what he planned to do
    with the day. She asked in a way that sounded innocent and inter-
    ested but was always critical. Seth Paul, her husband, didn’t bother
     to ask him anything. He just smirked as he walked by, obviously
    judging Scott a waste of time as he went about preparing for his
    important day. Scott had never liked Seth Paul very much, even at
    the wedding between him and his mother, when he knew he was
    supposed to put aside personal feelings and wish everyone well.
    But now that he was staying in Seth Paul’s house and was depen-
    dent on his generosity, Scott hated his guts.
     The house was a five-thousand-square-foot southwestern-style
    ranch, located fifteen miles south of the Las Vegas Strip in a gated
    community of other similarly spacious homes. It had broad, open
    floors of terra-cotta-colored tile and open archways painted Navajo
    white leading between the front foyer and the dining room and the
    living room. The kitchen adjoined the living room, separated only
    by a counter with stools, and copper-bottomed pots and pans hung
    from a rack above the island range. French doors opened from the
    living room onto a patio enclosed by two arms of the house. Bright
    flowering vines climbed the squared columns that held up wide,
    overhanging eaves, and a fluted fountain imported from Spain
    splashed in the center.
      Seth Paul bought the house with the proceeds from his seminars
    on motivational speaking, which he gave on a regular basis at the

```

-----

```
   circuit, booking himself several times a week for presentations to
   trade groups and associations of sales reps. This led to connections
   for presentations elsewhere in the country, at the headquarters of
   corporations. He had self-published a book about motivation that
   he had originally sold only at his seminars—back-of-the-room
   merchandising—but now it had been picked up by Regan Books
   and would soon be given distribution, publicity, end-cap space at
   Books-A-Million and Barnes & Noble. And he still had groups who
   came in to Las Vegas for his three-day “Motivational Boot Camp.”
    Scott watched him move through the house, surrounded by a
   little cloud of smugness and self-satisfaction, and he despised him.
   He knew that some part of his intense dislike for his stepfather
   came from envy, which only made him despise him more. And
   seeing his mother spend most of her time playing along with the
   game, catering to his wishes, praising his speech and his decrees,
   making him feel like he was the center of the universe, made Scott
   want to vomit.
    They didn’t leave the house until after ten every day, when they
   drove matching smw 5-series sedans to the offices Seth Paul main-
   tained in a glass tower just off the Strip. They could leave their
   air-conditioned garage, drive in their air-conditioned cars, arrive
   at the climate-controlled parking garage, and ascend via the eleva-
   tor without ever exposing themselves to the weather. Neither the
   black-capped inversions [that ] [made ] [the ] [air ] [thick ] [and ] [foul ] [smell- ]
   ing, nor the dry desert winds [that ] [could ] [desiccate ] [plants ] [in ] [a ] [half ]
   hour, nor the still, breathless [days ][of ][110 ] [in ][the ] [shade, ] [nor ] [the ] [rare ]
   monsoon rain that could [suddenly ] [overwhelm ] [the ] [storm-drain ]
   system and float off cars [beneath ] [the ] [overpasses ] [affected ] [them ] [on ]
   their journeys. They [never ] [drove ] [in ][the ] [same ] [car, ] [even ] [when ] [they ]
   knew they would return [at ][the ] [same ] [time, ] [and, ][more ] [frustrating ] [to ]
   Scott, they never thought [to ] [leave ] [a ] [car ] [for ] [him ] [to ] [use ] [during ] [the ]
   day. Even the gardeners [from ] [Michoacan ] [had ] [a ][pickup ] [truck. ] [Scott ]
   had been staying with [his ] [mother ] [for ] [three ] [weeks, ] [and ] [he ] [was ]
   going crazy.

```
     ing, and he knew he was alive, but what he did afterward made
    sense only for a man who felt powerless. He drove the Fury to a
     car wash that looked like a Mississippi River sternwheeler, from
    the days of Mark Twain, and he paid $175 for the Works, custom
    detailing after the wash. Then he checked out of the El Rancho
    and drove to the bank and withdrew five thousand dollars. At the
    Greyhound Bus depot, he found a late bus to Las Vegas. He didn’t
    want to fly to Las Vegas and have a name and a credit-card num-
    ber following him there, and he didn’t want to drive and have his
     car recognized and stopped. And he didn’t want to leave the car
    parked at the depot. He reasoned it would be only a matter of days
    before the car was declared abandoned and then traced both to the
    hit-and-run and to him, and someone would recognize a photo
    of him and place him on the Las Vegas bus. Craftily, he decided
     that the only place he could leave the car where it wouldn’t end up
    being processed by the police was on Catesby Street. And if leaving
     the car made him a hero to his son, even better. At the time, he
    hadn’t thought that leaving a car involved in a crime and encourag-
    ing his son to drive it might be a bad idea and certainly wouldn’t be
     a winner with Katherine.
     He’d had a taxi meet him at the house on Catesby Street and
    then left the Fury there and went to the depot to wait for the
    bus, dressed in Ben Davis jeans and a hickory-striped shirt, his
    seagoing clothes. He had his belongings in a seabag at his feet,
    cash folded into the special wallet that hung around his neck and
    inside his shirt. When he looked around at those traveling with
    him, he realized that he looked like he fit in. Everyone was travel-
    ing with the last scraps they could gather, traveling on cash only,
     ties broken with all institutions of finance. Men who looked lean
    and beaten, who looked like they had not worked for a salary for
    some time. Women who kept children gathered close to them,
    watching over their young heads for the danger that threatened
    them. All heading for the most western of cities, the most Amer-
    ican of cities, Las Vegas, where open spaces replaced personal

```

```
    His mother immediately invited him to stay with them as long
   as he needed to, and Seth Paul agreed with a careless ease that
   Scott soon identified as condescension. Seth Paul certainly didn’t
   have to worry about his wife’s emotions being divided. He had an
   abundance of her care and attention. And if Scott had been a weak
   rival for her love before, he was completely insignificant now that
   he had sought refuge under Seth Paul’s roof.
    When they finally left in their smws, after ten, Scott felt a bit freer
   to move around the house. He emerged from his corner seat and
   scrambled some eggs with cheese and ate them with salsa fresca,
   fresh-sliced avocado with lime juice squeezed over the top, a slice
   of papaya, and more coffee. Then he set himself at a glass-topped
   table with a view of the patio and opened up his laptop. He hadn’t
   been the only one on the bus to Las Vegas to be traveling with a
   computer. Even the desperate and down-and-out in Silicon Valley
   seemed to have scraped together the hundred dollars it took to buy
   a used Dell, and he saw one of the single mothers, possibly fleeing
   from a husband who habitually did her violence, open up a lap-
   top and encourage her son to pass the time by playing Doom. The
  boy typed in “iddqd,” the cheat code that made him invincible, and
   slaughtered the monsters who came before him.
    The first thing Scott did every morning was check his in-box
   for an email from Carter. There was never anything from his son,
   though a few messages sneaked past his filters, messages prom-
   ising penile enhancement (Add inches! Drive her wild!) or cheap
   Viagra or tips on penny stocks. He tried to delete them without
   looking at them.
    Then he wrote an email to Carter. He emailed Betty as well,
   from time to time. But he thought [he ][had ] [a ] [better ] [chance ] [of ][break- ]
   ing through to his son. [In ] [his ] [emails, ] [he ] [asked ] [him ] [how ] [he ] [was ]
   enjoying the car, how [he ] [was ] [enjoying ] [school, ] [how ] [he ] [was. ] [He ]
   asked how Katherine [was. ] [He ] [told ] [him ] [he ] [was ] [working ] [a ] [few ]
   things out, but that he [would ] [be ][back ] [soon. ] [He ] [asked ] [Carter ] [not ] [to ]
   tell his mother just yet [that ] [they ][were ] [in ] [contact. ] [He ] [wasn’t ] [quite ]

```

-----

```
      Scott thought about telling Carter that the car had been in an
    accident and that perhaps he should be careful about driving it to
    school. He thought about it every morning. But he always found
    some reason to put off doing so. He told himself he would wait
     until Carter wrote him back, at least once, and that allowed him to
     avoid the painful admission that he’d done something stupid and
     criminal.
      After writing Carter, he opened up a file labeled “Greatscott.doc.”
    “Great Scott” was the working title for the novel he had decided
     to write, an homage, he told himself, to The Great Gatsby. He was
    keeping it a secret from everyone until it was finished, and though
    he had no reason to think anyone would try to pirate his manu-
     script from his hard drive, he still felt a little thrill when he called
    up “Greatscott.doc,’” knowing that nobody else would know what
     it meant. He didn’t know what the novel was about yet, but he
    was sure it would have a hero who was forty-eight and went back
     to sea.
      He’d sit with his open laptop, and sip coffee, and contemplate
     the patio, and when he was just about to begin typing, the cleaning
    lady showed up. Her mother called her Senorita Lopez and always
     said she was pure gold, but Scott found her insufferable. Senorita
    Lopez had quickly sussed out the relative stature Scott had in the
    house and decided that she belonged there every bit as much as he
     did, if not more. After all, she was paid to be there as someone with
     an important function, while he was there on sufferance and had
     no function at all, so far as she could see. So she felt free to order
    him out of her way, to run the vacuum cleaner whether it bothered
    him or not, and to sigh theatrically whenever he left behind a juice
     glass or coffee cup. If he went outside, to one of the café tables,
     the din of lawn mowers, edgers, electric clippers seemed to assault
    him, whether it was from his mother’s yard or one of the many
     similar yards within the gated community. Also, there were misters
    arranged along the overhanging eaves that went off at odd times,
    suddenly spritzing the dry desert air with water. He never got used

```

-----

```
    After closing “Greatscott.doc” in the early afternoon, he went to
   the bedroom he was using and counted his money. Five thousand
   dollars sometimes seemed like a lot of money when he was laying
   it out in stacks of hundred dollar bills, but he knew that it really
  wasn’t. Five thousand was about what he had in his Etrade broker-
  age account after it had spiraled downward from six figures and he
  cashed it out to pay the mortgage and hide the truth from Kather-
   ine for one more month. Still, counting it helped him feel he was
   still a man with options. It felt good to have options. It helped him
   feel not so dependent on his mother and her asshole husband. One
  option he’d have to think about soon was shipping out again. The
  war was still going on, carrier battle groups were still in the Ara-
   bian Sea, and he could still find a berth aboard an oiler. His official
  vacation time was up, and he’d gotten another month of unpaid
  vacation, but soon msc was either going to have him shipped out
   or terminate his employment. And he didn’t want to be terminated.
  He wanted to be the one exercising the options.
    On the Monday of his fourth week there, Scott heard Seth Paul
   saying goodbye to his mother, See you at the offices, and moving to
   the air-conditioned garage. It wasn’t much different from other
  mornings. Sometimes, they even left at the same moment and had
   to operate the automatic garage door only once. He waited for his
  mother to follow, so that he could open up his laptop, see that Car-
   ter hadn’t emailed him, and get on with his day.
    But he didn’t hear his mother leave. And the atmosphere in the
  house didn’t change. He didn’t [feel ] [the ] [liberating ] [emptiness ] [he ]
  looked forward to every morning, [when ] [he ][could ] [walk ] [around ] [with ]
   a sense that his time was [his ] [and ] [there ] [was ] [no ] [one ] [to ][judge ][him. ] [He ]
   sat in his place in the armchair, [under ] [the ] [fern, ] [and ] [he ] [could ] [sense ]
   his mother waiting [for ] [him ] [to ] [emerge. ] [He ] [thought ] [about ] [trying ]
   to wait her out. Surely, [she ] [would ] [have ] [to ] [go ] [to ] [the ] [office ] [at ] [some ]
  point. But he wasn’t [sure ] [what ] [she ] [did ] [at ][the ] [office ] [that ][was ] [so ][vital, ]
   besides reading and [praising ] [Seth ] [Paul’s ] [latest ] [screeds, ] [making ] [sure ]
   his hair was in place, [and ] [generally ] [reflecting ] [his ] [own ] [brilliance ]

      He stood, picked up his coffee cup so that Senorita Lopez
     wouldn’t bitch at him when she came in, and walked to the
     kitchen. His mother wasn’t there, so he knew that she was wait-
     ing for him in the room they called the library. He decided it was
     stupid to try to avoid talking with his mother. He had an idea what
     she would say, and delaying it wouldn’t change anything. He felt a
     choice looming up before him, a choice with consequences.
      The library had a large adobe-colored beehive fireplace in one
     corner, and a wall of white bookshelves [filled ] [with ] [hardcover ] [books ]
     chosen by the interior designer, who also chose the Navajo rugs
    hanging from the walls, the overstuffed leather chairs with otto-
    mans facing the fireplace, and the tasteful paintings by two local
     artists whom the designer deemed “Potentially Collectible.” Scott
     had looked over the books and found them shelved haphazardly,
     hardcover novels mixed in with history, travel books next to A Brief
     History of Time. A matching set of books on artists—Goya! Matisse!—
     stood together with matching leather covers. Scott had never seen
     his mother or Seth Paul read any of them. His mother generally
     read lifestyle and health magazines, with cover stories about sex
     and aging and diet or books that began with the phrase What Your
     Doctor May Not Tell You About . . . Seth Paul read and reread what he
     called the classics of his field: Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich,
     Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People, and others.
    He also read what he called “the competition”—Rick Warren’s The
     Purpose-Driven Life, and The Secret. There were always new ones
     to keep up with. He didn’t have a specifically religious element to
     his seminars, preferring a more generically spiritual tone, but he
    wanted to keep up with what was hot.
      As Scott suspected, his mother was sitting in one of the leather
     chairs. Even though it was eighty degrees and the air conditioner
     was running, she had the gas logs lit in the fireplace. It was Novem-
     ber, and she liked the cozy feel of the crackling ember effect. She
     saw Scott and smiled and stretched.
       “It’s so beautiful here,” she said.

  year before he showed up on a Greyhound bus, and in that time she
  seemed to have grown younger. She actually looked younger than he
   did. He thought she must have had plastic surgery, because the skin
  of her face looked strangely tight and she always seemed to be forcing
   a smile, as though two invisible hooks were tugging at the corners of
  her mouth. But she would admit only to Botox and instead credited
  the bioidentical hormone-replacement therapy she was on, as well
   as various juice fasts that left her bowels clean as a newborn’s. She
  was prone to launching into long monologues about the benefits of
  wheatgrass, or pomegranate juice, or the bowel-cleansing powers of
  eating only quinoa and corn for two days, and sometimes she called
  on Scott to witness her rubbing an ointment made of natural estrogen
  onto her thigh or asked him to feel the glands under her chin.
    Hearing his mother talk about her hormones or her bowels
  made Scott feel ill. Seth Paul seemed to have mastered the art of
  smiling absently as she talked about those things, which made her
  focus even more intently on Scott. And when Seth Paul wasn’t
  around, she confided to Scott that it was him and his genius, above
   all, that were responsible for how she felt. Scott thought that she
  was referring to her sex life, and so he never asked for details.
    “So beautiful,” she repeated.
    Scott looked out the window toward the central patio. A mister
  shot the air full of water droplets.
    “Dear,” she continued, “both Seth Paul and I are concerned
  about you.”
   “Pm all right,” Scott said.
    “There. You see how defensive you’re being? How high your
  barriers are?”
    Scott knew he was already screwed. If he denied being defen-
   sive, he would only prove her point. If he admitted it, he would
  also prove her point.
   “We know you’re trying to work through a hard time, and you
  want to find a way to heal your marriage with Kathy, and we want
   to help you.”

```

```
      “No we're not,’ she said. “I’m afraid we’re enabling you.”
     When she spoke, she also nodded, as though she were miming
     the agreement Scott was supposed to find with her. The two corners
     of her mouth pointed up, like little arrows, giving her an incongru-
     ous smile even when she was expressing gentle disapproval.
      “Before I went through Seth Paul’s workshop, I was so much
     like you,” she said.
      “You were still married to Dad,’ Scott said.
      “Yes, but that wasn’t a true marriage. And I was settling for it.”
      Scott wondered how his father would feel about being told that
     his marriage of thirty years wasn’t true. He hadn’t been to see his
     father since he’d arrived in Las Vegas, though he knew he was
    working as a doorman at the New York-New York Casino.
      “Now, the question for you is how to find a true marriage again
    with Katherine. She shouldn’t have to settle for less. And neither
    should you.”
      Scott knew where this was headed. He suddenly wished he were
    counting his money, making neat stacks of hundred-dollar bills.
      His mother told him about a Motivational Boot Camp, starting
    tomorrow. A three-day intensive. Both she and Seth Paul thought
     that it would be the most important first step he could take.
      She nodded as she spoke. And how could anyone disagree with
    someone who was in her sixties and had such flawless skin?
      “Okay,” he said. “I’ll go.”
      “And sweetie. I haven’t even talked to Seth Paul about this. But he’s
     thinking about franchising out his seminar. He’s so needed, every-
    where, and there’s only one of him. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if . . . ?”
      She smiled and left the rest unsaid. It was clear to Scott that the
     more he was like Seth Paul, the more she would think of him as
     a success. He could even go on the road, an avatar of Seth Paul,
     and help spread his word. His mother was sure that it would make
     Katherine love him as he deserved.
       “I don’t know,” Scott said. “I don’t know when I could be ready
     for something like that.”

  The casino floor, even at nine thirty in the morning, seemed sus-
  pended in an odd kind of light, both flashy and dark at the same
   time. Around the banks of slot machines, electronic bursts of
   orange, red, flamingo pink exploded from screens, along with the
   arpeggio of electronic tones that mimed the sound of coins spilling
   forth. A cooler luminosity enveloped the table games, the arcs of
   blackjack tables and the long green fields of the craps tables where
   a low, steady patter was punctuated by occasional yells. But the
   islands of brightness all hovered in a warm half-light, completely
   uncoupled from the surrounding world, the same subtle indirect
   illumination of walls and ceilings at all hours. The people at their
   tables and their machines had the comfortable feeling that the vast
   space helped them, protected them, uplifted them in their individ-
   ual pursuits.
    Scott walked through the gaming floor to get to the conference
   center at the mcm Grand, wearing khakis and a blousy, long-sleeved
   Oxford. If there was a way to get to the conference center without
   passing gambling opportunities, he hadn’t found it. As he walked
   on the carpet printed with the heads of lions, he was aware of the
   travel wallet he had hanging from [a ][nylon ][cord ] [inside ] [his ] [shirt. ] [His ]
   five thousand dollars in cash. He’d decided he didn’t trust Senorita
   Lopez not to clip it if she found [it, ][peel ][off ][a ][hundred-dollar ] [bill ] [or ]
   two. And it gave him a sense [of ][autonomy. ] [Even ] [if ][he ][was ] [follow- ]
   ing his mother’s directives, [taking ] [the ] [seminar ] [as ] [the ] [price ] [of ][stay- ]
   ing in the house, the cash [gave ] [him ] [the ] [conviction ] [that ] [he ] [could ]
   walk out at any time. [He ] [also ] [carried ] [a ] [nylon ] [computer ] [carrying ]
   case with his laptop, [containing ] [Greatscott.doc. ]
    At a folding table outside the Vista Ballroom, Scott picked up a
   registration folder from a young woman who had everything laid
   out in neat alphabetical rows. Inside the folder was a blank pad of
   paper, a blue pen with the words Motivational Boot Camp printed
   in gold, an agenda, and a registration badge with his name in red.

```
    room, tables were arranged with folding chairs in shallow arcs
    around a raised stage with a podium. He saw his mother talking
     to some hotel employees, gesturing at the buffet in the back of the
    room that held urns of coffee, pitchers of orange juice, baskets of
     tiny muffins, croissants, and danishes. When she finished with
    them, she turned and hurried out a side door. She hadn’t noticed
     Scott filing in among the other conferees.
      Scott spread open his folder and drew circles on his pad of
    paper while the seats around him slowly filled. He kept his laptop
     at his feet, but he saw a number of people open computers on the
     tables, ready to type notes directly into a document. He also saw a
    number carrying Seth Paul’s book Your Best Self: A Motivation-Based
    Program and leafing through it. Some of the books had the worn
    look of having been read many times.
     The lights dimmed slightly, warmer lights bathed the podium,
    and Seth Paul strode out, saluting the audience with a half wave.
    He was dressed in black linen slacks, a dove-gray silk shirt open at
     the throat, and his silver hair swept back from his perfectly tanned
     face. He smiled at the warm applause, his teeth very white against
     his tan, and waited at the podium for it to taper off. Some people
    turned his book over and compared the large back-cover author’s
    photo with the man standing before them.
     When he began to speak, the people around Scott grew intent,
    focused. Scott noted this with surprise. He disliked Seth Paul so
    much that he had assumed that anyone who went to his seminars
    must have been duped in some way, and they would all end up
    feeling about him the same way Scott did. But they were listening
     carefully, taking notes, and Scott noticed that the woman next to
    him had a name tag from a motivation seminar that she had taken
     last year. She had gotten something out of the seminar, enough
     that she would come back again.
     He began to listen, and unthinkingly he began to take notes.
    The goal was to rechange yourself. We’ve all changed from people
    who do believe in our dreams to people who don’t. We need to

```

```
   rechange, return to our natural state of limitless possibilities.
     At the end of the boot camp, you would be able to write down
    a description of your best self. And you would be able to articulate
    a true dream you want to achieve, the maximal expression of your
   best self. Finally, you would identify the obstacles between you and
   your dream and grow motivation to overcome them. Grow motiva-
    tion. Organically. Like a tree, growing within you. The tree of life,
   which is already there.
     Scott watched Seth Paul move easily from behind the podium
   with a remote mike clipped to his shirt, making eye contact, engag-
   ing the audience, finding humor, asking people’s names and a
   snippet of their story, and weaving them into his presentation. And
    Scott began to wonder himself who his best self was and how his
    true dream exemplified his best self, and he found himself forget-
   ting that he despised the man speaking in front of him.
    When Seth Paul completed his remarks by telling everyone that
   he expected them all to find something life changing by the end of
   three days, the attendees applauded, and he applauded them back,
   saluting them for coming to be motivated and for committing to
   carry their motivation out into the world. Scott applauded with
   everyone else, and he looked at the agenda in his folder of mate-
    rial. There were breakout groups before and after lunch and some
   “dreamstorming” tasks to be completed in the evening before the
   next day’s sessions. He saw that his mother was facilitating one of
   the groups, but fortunately it wasn’t his. He looked at her standing
   below the podium, answering questions, directing people to the
   correct conference room, looking poised and competent. And she
   looked happy. He had misjudged [her ][role ] [in ][Seth ] [Paul’s ] [enterprise. ]
   If he was the creative, she was [the ] [production. ] [And ] [it ][contented ]
   her, and even allowed her [to ] [baffle ] [time ] [and ] [grow ] [younger. ] [It ][sud- ]
   denly didn’t seem so bad to Scott.
    He met his breakout group in Room 203. The facilitator was a
   woman named Barbara who looked around thirty-five, but Scott
   wondered whether she wasn’t really forty-eight, his age, and had

     to Las Vegas soon afterward. She now worked in guest services at
    the Mirage when she wasn’t helping with the seminars, and she
    introduced herself by talking about how much motivation helped
    her give world-class service to her guests. She had found her best
     self by helping others.
     The members of Scott’s group were all leading lives very much like
     the one he had led before he lost so much money in the stock market,
    before he lost his job and his house. They had jobs with health insur-
    ance and 401(k) plans—they had families. They had managed to buy
     real estate in the Bay Area or Los Angeles or San Diego or Phoenix,
    managed to climb onto that ladder of price escalation they thought
    would never end. They were white mostly, two women of Chinese
    parentage and one woman originally from Nicaragua who worked
     in banking. More women than men. They lived in the center of the
    land of affluence. They were successes in the normal, ordinary sense
    of the word. But they didn’t feel like successes. They were seeking a
    door to open for them, into a bright space they could not define.
     One by one they introduced themselves, said where they were
    from, told how they made a living. They struggled to articulate
    what they wanted to get from the seminar, but Barbara was gentle
    and encouraging, assuring them they would know more by Satur-
    day evening.
      Scott had an urge to lie as the round of introductions approached
    him. He wanted to erase the past four years and return to that
    slumberous American peace he’d found so unsatisfying. There
    would be no bursting of the tech bubble, no split-up with Kath-
     erine. There would be no 9/11. No war in Iraq, no need for able
    seamen with experience on fleet oilers. He would fit in with them
    and their unhappy aspirations. He had the odd feeling that if he
    had taken this seminar instead of investing in Internet start-ups,
     his life would have been different.
     The woman next to him worked in sales for a transportation
     firm, selling space in containers that began in China and were
    shipped across the ocean and then moved by railroad and truck to

   gets kept rising and the incentives kept rising too, but she realized
   that exceeding targets and making incentives weren’t making her
   happy. She wasn’t sure if she wanted the seminar to help motivate
   her to continue in sales or to help motivate her to find a new pas-
   sion and purpose.
    Everyone nodded and then turned to look at Scott. He hesitated.
     “Scott Cochran?” Barbara said warmly.
     “T want to write a book,” he blurted.
     To his surprise, nobody laughed—nobody looked skeptical. The
   smiles were warm and comprehending, and several people tapped
   themselves over the heart and mouthed, “Me too.” They all wanted
    to write books, it seemed. Scott, unwittingly, had voiced the group’s
   common unspoken desire. To write a book, to explain themselves,
   authenticate them, justify themselves once and for all. And then,
   most important, to have their book published, with cover art, and
   an author’s photo to validate their endeavors, so that forever after-
   ward they would be able to refer back to that artifact, brilliantly and
   indisputably existing—My Book.
    Encouraged, ‘emboldened, Scott began to describe what the
   book was about, losing everything, fighting back, learning lessons.
   He told about his life, just as everyone else around the table had
   done, but he told it as though it were already in a book, already a
    story. He couldn’t tell them how the story ended. Maybe that, he
    said, was what he wanted the [seminar ] [to ] [accomplish. ] [To ] [tell ] [him ]
   how to write the happy ending he deserved.
    When he finished speaking, rushing his words, he saw the oth-
    ers look at him admiringly. [Barbara ] [nodded ] [at ] [him ] [and ] [began ] [to ]
   speak before the next person [could ] [introduce ] [herself. ]
     “Scott’s presentation is exemplary in several ways,” she began,
   “and we can all learn from it. First. . .”
     For the rest of the day, through the buffet Junch and all the
   afternoon sessions, Scott felt as though a bright aura had settled
   about him. He had stumbled into a social circle that would accept
   his most vain and self-justifying statements about himself and

    and women who wanted to form an online writing group and keep
    in touch after the seminar was over.
     One woman named Helen touched him while they spoke. She
    wore narrow black glasses and had bleached blonde hair, and she
    asked him what he was doing that night. He had made it clear in
    what he said that his main goal, above all else, was to regain Kath-
    erine’s love and be again the man he had been before in the past.
    But such frank statements only seemed to make him more desir-
    able to her. He tried to put her off with a promise to stay in touch,
    but she didn’t want to have a spiritual or artistic connection in the
    future. She wanted a physical connection in the here and now. She
    wanted fornication. And she finally convinced him to meet her
    later in the Paris Casino.
     He saw his mother in the hallway after the last session, and he
    told her he didn’t want to ride to Henderson with her. He had his
    laptop, and he wanted to get right to work on the “dreamstorm-
    ing” tasks he’d been given—to write down, in a single sentence,
    his purpose in life. His mother smiled and told him to come home
    anytime. He had the security code, and he could let himself in.
      “It’s working, isn’t it?” she said. “You’re rechanging.”
      “T think so,” Scott said.
     Barbara walked by then, and she paused. “Peggy, your son is
    wonderful.”
      His mother nodded at Barbara, and Scott felt a blush of pleasure
    similar to a third grader whose teacher had praised him to his parents.
     He walked back through the casino floor, through that buoyant,
     half-lit space, and through the two sets of doors to emerge into
    the sunlight of early November. The lights hadn’t yet come on, but
    shadows from the hotels on the west side of the Strip angled over
    the slow-moving cars. The sidewalks were crowded, and it was still
    warm enough for tourists to be walking in shorts and polo shirts
    and running shoes. Some walked with their video cameras held
    before them, guiding their steps by the small rectangular image in
    the flipped-out screen. Others paused and stretched out their cell

```

```
   people like themselves, at a show, at dinner, at the tables, having
   fun. A booming but indistinct noise hovered over the street, the dis-
   tant and continuous construction. On the corners, young Hispanic
   men handed out pornographic photos of women accompanied by
   phone numbers. They offered them to all men with a distinctive
   snap of paper, regardless of whether the man was accompanied by
    a woman. Alongside them, missionaries in white shirts and black
   slacks handed out Bible tracts.
    The Eiffel Tower, half the size of the original and much brighter,
   loomed above the Strip, and Scott walked into the noisy, air-
   conditioned casino space. The pits of table games were stylized with
   bronze art deco sculptures similar to the ones found at the entrance
    to Paris Metro stations, labeled Sainte Honorée, Etoile, Tivoli, Con-
   corde, and the banks of slot machines were called “French Kiss
   Slots” and “Parlez Vous Poker.” The dollar- and five-dollar machines
   were set apart in a separate section labeled “Champagne Slots.”
     Scott had several hours before his date with Helen—he guessed
    it was a date—and he walked through the casino to the restaurant
   and shopping area called Le Boulevard. It was designed to resem-
   ble a winding cobblestone street in a French provincial town. The
   roof overhead was painted in sky blue and clouds, and there were
   artificial trees and greenish bronze streetlights. Shops of various
   kinds sold Les articles and Le journal, and above the ground-floor
   shops were features of a nonexistent second story, tiny man-
   sard roofs and red shutters around fake windows and shallow
   wrought-iron balconies.
    He found a French-style café called JJ’s Boulangerie, ordered
   a caffé latte—the names of [coffee ] [drinks ] [were ] [in ] [Italian—and ] [sat ]
   down at a small table. He [breathed ] [in ] [deeply ] [and ] [decided ] [the ] [air ]
   smelled French. There was [an ] [aroma ] [of ][baguettes ] [freshly ] [baked, ]
   the good smell of strong [coffee ] [and ] [steamed ] [milk ] [hissing ] [from ] [the ]
   ornate bronze and copper [espresso ] [maker, ] [an ] [indefinable ] [and ] [per- ]
   haps imaginary scent [of ][lavender ] [from ] [a ] [French ] [country ] [garden. ]
   He found it easy to [ignore ] [the ] [bare-kneed ] [tourists ] [going ] [by, ] [the ]

    he’d walked with along the Strip. He opened his laptop, opened a
    document, and entitled it Parisdreamstorm.doc.
      It was hard to imagine a better place to write than this. He felt
     at one with the milieu, as though he fit right in with the scene, an
    American writer in a European café, alone with his work while the
    world busied itself about him. He hovered his hands over the key-
    board and then wished someone would take a picture of him with
    his fingers poised, just about to lay down the first word of the day.
     He paused and thought about checking email. He hadn’t yet
    checked that day, and he hadn’t written Carter. He didn’t know
    whether his son would have finally answered him, but he had
    an urge to write him, now that he felt that something was chang-
    ing, now that he felt he was taking action to fulfill his dreams. He
    ached for his son’s approval, the same ache he felt for his wife’s
    acceptance and love. And he thought that if he could express in an
    email the sense of passion and purpose, the sense of his best self,
     that he had received, he was sure Carter would write him back.
     He checked the upper bar for a WiFi signal, but he couldn’t
    find one. He promised himself he would find Internet access and
    email Carter as soon as he had finished writing in the café. And he
    thought how much more authentic his email would be if he had
    just spent two hours on his novel.
      Scott opened Greatscott.doc and looked at the first page, those
    aspiring first two words: Chapter One. Then he returned to Paris-
    dreamstorm and hovered his fingers over the keyboard again.
     He began to wonder if he should buy a beret. They probably sold
    them someplace in the casino. It would probably be easier to write
     if he was wearing a beret. Hemingway wore a beret. Who else wore
     a beret? Besides Frenchmen. Salvador Dali? Picasso? Mitch Albom?
    He thought about leaving the café to find a beret. And he thought
    about the croissants in the pastry display at the counter. A beret and
     a croissant. Or a beret and a muffin. Banana walnut.
     One hint Barbara had given everyone was to write about
    yourself in the third person if you’re stuck. Even if you couldn’t

   else. Scott closed his eyes and began to type.
    Scott Cochran has given voice to his generation.
    He looked at those words, in Times New Roman. On a computer
   screen made up of flickering pixels, yet suddenly seeming solid and
   authentic, as though already printed, as though already true.
    He wrote another sentence. On “The Today Show,” first-time
   author Scott Cochran discussed his book with Katie Couric.
    Suddenly, writing was easy. He wrote about how the book
   would be received, what it would mean to people’s lives. He
   wrote blurbs the book would have on the back cover from famous
   authors—he wrote snippets from the reviews the book would get.
   He wrote about himself, reading from the book, signing the book,
   being interviewed about the book.
    “Mr. Cochran’s book explores the dilemma and promise of
    the sons and daughters of the Greatest Generation.”
                       —The New York Times
    “Mr. Cochran’s book, finally, proposes a fulfilled lifestyle.”
                            —usa Today
     “A heartfelt cross between novel and memoir.”
                          —Mitch Albom
    “Good work. Good man.”
                      —Ernest Hemingway

   cess he would enjoy. He wrote in the present time about himself

    had already overcome the barriers between him and the brightness
     that awaited him. And underlying it all, unspoken, was the recep-
     tion he would receive from Katherine and Carter and even Betty.
     He signaled the barista for another caffe latte, and she brought
     it even though they didn’t normally have table service. He offered
    her a twenty-dollar bill, and she took it and told herself that she
    would give him change when he asked for it, though she suspected
    he wouldn’t. She got monster tips several times a day, from the
    generous types nicknamed “George,” and she knew it paid to cater
     to the eccentric in Las Vegas.
     The desire Scott expressed through writing about himself was
     the same desire that everyone [in ] [his ] [breakout ] [group ] [felt. ] [Beneath ]
     the various languages of self-fulfillment, the goal to which they all
    pointed was love. The people in his group wanted to open doors
     for themselves, find their authentic voices, develop confident
    personae, even learn to make boatloads of money. But always, at
     the end of their labors, was the desire for love.
      Scott turned off his computer, stood up, transfigured by his vision
     of himself. He staggered down the French village street, past the shop
    windows with colorful awnings and the fake workshop of Alexandre
    Gustave Eiffel. The same streams of tourists were walking, dressed in
     shorts and sandals and T-shirts, holding up digital cameras or small
     video recorders or cell phones, talking, happily oblivious to Scott’s
     feelings. He thought his face must be shining, like a prophet come
    down from the mountain, but nobody seemed to notice.
      The casino area opened about him, spacious and filled with
    chimes and rattles and the noise of human play. Everything about
    him seemed suddenly animate and meaningful. All the scraps of
     light and color, the twisting smoke of a cigarette, the pleas and
     shouts of the craps players, the glint of sequins on a woman’s dress,
     the pattern in the carpet, the smell of bodies, all seemed to speak
     to him in a language he understood and had no need to translate.
    He walked as though a god went before him, feeling utterly safe
    and secure.

   stopped at one, oddly humanoid in shape, broad shouldered with a
   smaller head capping it off, and he felt the machine communicate
   to him. He took his wallet from within his shirt and drew out five
   hundred-dollar bills and fed them into the slot and watched the
   credits for play mount up. He selected maximum play, five dollars
   a spin, and hit the big button and watched the animated reels flash
   and pop.
    He hit his first jackpot in ten minutes. The lights on top of the
   machine flashed, and bells rang, and he saw three double bars of
   gold across the center line of the machine. Two hundred to one.
   A thousand dollars. He pushed the large Credit button and saw
   the electronic numbers spin up. He pushed maximum play again,
   watched the animated reels, rich in cherries, and stars, and stack
   of gold bars.
    He hit another jackpot, and then another. An attendant came
   by, dressed in smart black slacks and a white blouse and had him
   fill out a w-2c form for a payout of fifteen hundred dollars. He
   had her write down the information for him while he continued
   to play, showing her the able-bodied seaman’s card that carried his
   Social Security number. He [didn’t ] [want ] [to ] [stop. ] [The ] [numbers ] [on ]
   his credits for play continued [to ] [spiral ] [up, ] [and ] [other ] [slots ] [players, ]
   attracted by the sound and [light, ] [began ] [to ] [fill ][in ][the ] [machines ] [near ]
   him. A cocktail waitress, [dressed ] [like ] [a ] [French ] [gamine, ] [brought ]
   him a gin and tonic, and [he ] [tipped ] [her ] [ten ] [dollars. ] [He ] [didn’t ]
  know what time it was. [He ] [communed ] [with ] [the ] [machine ] [in ] [front ]
   of him, listening for [its ] [message, ] [and ] [its ] [message ] [was ] [always ] [the ]
   same: Place Maximum [Bet. ] [He ] [hit ][the ] [Play ][button ] [with ][a ][satisfying ]
   smack, and the reels [spun ] [and ] [told ] [him ] [he ][was ] [immortal. ]
    Finally, a hollow plastic splashing sound broke his concen-
   tration. Beside him, an old man in a shiny shirt with a string tie
   had unzipped his fly and was urinating into a large plastic change
   bucket. It was a long, slow pee, the work of an older man with an
   enlarged prostate. Scott stopped playing while the sound contin-
   ued, looking away from the change bucket with the script Paris

     cherries for a twenty-to-one payout. As the machine began to tone
    and chime, he noticed Scott had spotted him, and he winked from
     his seamed and gnomish face. Scott pressed the Cash Out button
    on the machine and hoped the attendant would come before he
    wet his own pants.
      The men’s room off the casino floor was splendid with black marble
    counters and black-and-white tile floors. He was disappointed there
    was no ice in the urinals. He had always wanted to be able to say
    he was pissing on ice, and he felt like he was. His five thousand
     was more than doubled, to ten thousand. He walked back onto the
     casino floor and felt buoyed up by the cash in his wallet.
     He cast his eye about with a certain air of mastery, as though
    choosing where he would next win, since he was indisputably
     a winner. He still didn’t know what time it was. When he was
    twenty-one and driving from the Bay Area to Reno to gamble legally
     for the first time, he had played blackjack and craps. He now grav-
     itated toward the craps tables, toward the music of the patter and
     call, the dealers and the shooters calling for bets, calling for num-
     bers, Coming Out, Hard Way, Yo, Big Six, Big Eight. He found a place
     at the rail, pulled out his wallet, and waited until the shooter made
     his point. Then he laid down two stacks of hundred-dollar bills to
    buy chips, the black ones worth a hundred dollars apiece. One of
     the dealers called out “Change, two thousand,” and stuffed the bills
    with a plastic blade through a slot in the green felt table.
      Immediately, he began to win. He placed two chips on the pass
     line, and the shooter rolled a seven. He dragged the winnings and
    waited for the next roll. The shooter rolled a six, and he backed
    up his pass bet to take the odds and placed two more chips on the
    come line. The shooter rolled a four, and he took the odds and the
    shooter rolled a four again. Then the shooter rolled a six, and all of
     his bets were winners.
     The first shooter made three points before crapping out, and
     Scott saw the lines of chips in the wells before him grow longer. He
     felt like a magician. The chips he threw onto the table returned to

```

-----

```
   allowed players to press their bets. The noise of winning, the happy,
   frantic noise of humans who feel themselves touched by fortune,
   attracted more people to the table, until there was hardly space to
   stand. Everyone was pouring money onto the table, Hard Ways,
   Proposition Bets, Field Bets. The dealers called the roll, and chips
   were pushed back to the players, and everyone felt they would never
   lose again. People crowded around the table, watching over the
   players’ shoulders, wishing they could get into the game that was
   hot, the table that was hot, promising themselves that they would be
   in the right place next time, and they would know to commit them-
   selves totally—they would know it was their time to win.
     Scott felt someone lean in against his ass, felt a woman draping
   herself over his back, and he turned and saw Helen propping her
   chin over his left shoulder. She still wore her narrow black glasses,
   and her bleached blonde hair, flattish on top, shimmered weirdly
   in the casino light, as though it were going to lift up off of her
   head. She had changed into a looser blouse and casual jeans, and
   she’d had one martini while waiting for Scott at the Zinc bar.
     “Hey,” said Scott. “Am I late? I lost track of time.”
     “It’s all right,’ Helen said. “I just looked for the hot table. I
   knew Id find you here.”
    Helen had been attracted to Scott even before he announced that
   he wanted to write a book and had become the ideal and exemplum
   for the breakout group. His thick hair, just curling over his ears,
    still black even though he was surely the same age as her. His taut
   neck and defined jawline indicating a slim body, still boyish in the
   hips. And then the timbre of his voice when he spoke, a man’s voice,
   yet still youthful and searching. She chose him before he’d finished
   speaking.
    Helen attended workshops on life coaching, self-actualization,
   dream envisioning, inner motivation every six months or so. She
   continually sought a key to understanding herself and her career
   in real estate, and each workshop made her feel good about herself
   for a few months. Then a buzzing dissatisfaction settled deep into

```

-----

```
     lost faith that the key could be found, even though each work-
     shop’s pathway proved lacking. There was always another work-
    shop to try, and she was a believer in believing.
      And there was always a guy waiting for her at every workshop.
    A cute guy who understood her needs, since he was seeking the
    same help she was. And a cute guy who wouldn’t follow her home
     and make demands on her while she tried out her new way to
     her own centered self. The times she had met someone who was
     also from San Diego, it had ended badly and sent her in search of
     another workshop even more quickly. Scott was from San José. He
     was seeking. He was cute. He was perfect.
      “I knew I’d find you at the lucky table,” she told Scott. “I knew
    you’d be luck.”
     “New shooter,” the dealer cried. “Coming out!”
      “Play eleven for me,” Helen said.
      Scott gave her a grin and threw a twenty-five-dollar chip on the
     table. “Give me a yo,” he called.
      “Yo, yo,” the stick man called. “Bet.”
      The shooter was a young black woman in a metallic silver dress.
     She had her boyfriend blow on the dice, then sent them crazily
    down the felt, over the stacks of chips on the pass line, and against
     the low multifaceted surface surrounding the table.
      “Yo,” a dealer sang. “Yo-leven. Winner, winner.”
      The dice showed a six and a five, sitting beautiful against the
     green, and the dealer placed fifteen twenty-five-dollar chips next
     to Scott’s one placed on the eleven. He remembered something
     his father said. Elevens often repeat. His father, who was working
     as a doorman. Drawn to Las Vegas in the wake of the woman he
     loved and would continue to love for the rest of his life. His father,
    whom he hadn’t even called since he’d arrived.
      Elevens often repeat.
      “Let it ride on the yo,” he called.
      “Let it ride, let it ride,” the music began. “Ride on the yo.”
      “Yes,” he heard Helen say in his ear. “Yes yes yes.”

```

```
   the table to mix with the two that had just been thrown, and he
   pushed and pulled them several times with the stick, so that it was
   impossible to distinguish them from each other. Then he pushed
   them down the table to the young woman in the silver dress. She
   picked two and winked at Scott.
    “Yo, baby,” she said as she cast the dice.
    The table exploded in shouts and cries of anguish, envy, admi-
   ration. The blessed six and five, again on the felt, and the players
   on the rail and the spectators behind them yelled and cried and
   swore they had thought of making the same play themselves, they
   had dreamed it, and even though they had faltered at the brink
   this time, they had seen it, by God, they had seen it happen for
   someone, and that meant it could happen for them as well. And
   next time, when the magic moment arrived, they would recognize
   it and seize it and not prove [diffident ] [and ] [meek. ] [The ] [dealer ] [quickly ]
   calculated the payoff, four [hundred ] [times ] [fifteen, ] [and ] [pushed ]
   six thousand dollars’ worth [of ] [chips ] [out ] [to ] [Scott, ] [and ] [everyone ]
   watched him to see what he [would ] [do. ] [Even ] [as ] [their ] [own ] [pass-line ]
   bets were paid as winners, [he ] [seemed ] [the ] [only ][winner ] [at ][the ] [table, ]
   and everyone’s luck was [only ][a ][reflection ] [of ][his ] [luck. ]
    “Drag it,’ Scott said, and the stick pushed the chips toward him,
   and he took all his chips off the table and wondered how he would
   carry them all to the cashier’s window.
    “Can we color that up for you, sir?” the dealer said.
    “Sure.” Scott placed all his chips down and watched the dealer
   quickly and expertly exchange all the small-denomination chips
   for stacks of blacks. Scott gave a hundred-dollar toke to each of
   the three men working the table and saw Helen gaze at him admir-
   ingly. Before he turned away, a suited casino rep was at his side,
   asking him if he had lodging for the night, if he would like to stay
   as a guest of Paris. And if he’d like to dine as their guest, reserva-
   tions could be made immediately.
    The players and the spectators watched Scott go, and the mood
   at the table collapsed. Everyone was certain now that it was he who

```
     to see if they were right, and the woman in the silver dress threw
     a three, and they lost, then a two, and they lost again, and one by
     one they began to gather up their chips and winnings and regrets.
      For Scott, the rest of the evening moved swiftly, taking its course
    with an empty-headed inevitability. He went to dinner with Helen, at
    Mon Ami Gabi, the waiters wearing white aprons and black bow ties,
    and they split a bottle of Bordeaux and had a flute of Veuve Clicquot
    with enormous desserts. They had a nightcap at the Eiffel Tower Bar,
    halfway up the replica of the tower, where they had a view of New
     York, Venice, Rome, and Scott was stupefied to find himself treated
     like a winner, called a winner, a winner at last. Then they went to the
    room that was waiting for them, that was always waiting for winners.
    Helen pressed Scott against the wall in the hallway several times to
     kiss him before they got to the door, so that when he finally slipped
     the card in and turned the handle, they seemed to fall in on top of
     each other. Scott was carrying, still carrying, his small laptop case,
    and it was a relief to finally have a place to set it down and not worry
     about it. He had his hands inside Helen’s blouse, and he discovered he
      still knew how to loose a bra with a quick snap of his thumb and fore-
     finger. She reached into her purse around his back and fumbled for a
    condom as she pushed him back toward the bed. They fell together,
      still mostly clothed, and only then did Scott remember that it was the
     first day since he’d left San José that he hadn’t emailed Carter.

    9
  KATHERINE WONDERED ABOUT LOVE —the outrageous prom-
   ise of it all. She’d come home early in the morning after the crazy
   night with Heber, pulling into the subdivision at four a.m. under
   the quiet dark of stars, finding the Fury safely in the driveway and
   knowing her son and her father were safe. She hoped to get three
   hours of sleep. Heber decided to just stay at the motel and wear the
   same clothes to work the next day, since it wasn’t such an issue for
   a man. Katherine wasn’t going to show up wearing the same outfit
   two days in a row, not with Rajni [the ] [gab ] [queen ] [sharing ] [her ] [bay ]
   of desks.
    She thought she could steal in and wake up at her normal time
   and not admit how late she had been, but she found her father
   sitting up, listening to Rosemary Clooney sing with Duke Elling-
   ton and rubbing a cup of coffee between his hands. She was aston-
   ished to find him up, and not prostrate from chemo, but strangely
   enlivened. And though finding him up and waiting for her was
   ludicrously similar to something that could have happened when
   she was fifteen, he didn’t ask her about where she had been. She
   poured herself a cup of coffee as well, and they sat across the table
   and talked about her mother. Katherine listened, mostly. Her father
   talked about how much he missed her still and how much he’d
   loved her. She was a woman who went for the story, he said, who
   believed that their life together was going to follow a story line
   with a happy ending. And he also talked about how being alone
   was no way to get through your sixties and seventies. Loving some-
   one else wouldn’t have meant that he’d loved Mary Katherine less.
    He also told her that he thought Carter was getting a girlfriend.
   He didn’t think Carter would tell her himself, so he was letting her
   know. A girl with a funny name, and a nose ring, but he supposed
    it didn’t matter so much. Katherine felt herself become jealous for

```

-----

```
     she felt something loosen in her chest, open, as her father talked
    about how Carter was joining the club, joining those who had
     loved.
      Five hours later, at the office, Katherine and Heber were polite
    with each other, but distant. She didn’t ask him if he wanted any-
    thing when she went to the copy room where coffee was on. She
     didn’t include him in poking fun at odd emails or absurd requests
    from clients planning on attending the users’ conference. They
    hadn’t talked about how they should act in the office, but Kath-
    erine knew it was best to keep it quiet for now, and she would
    have found it impossible to act exactly as she had before. Heber
     hadn’t known what to expect, but he acted similarly distant, and
    when he spoke her name he pronounced it with careful formality,
     so that no hint of passion or affection showed through. Kath-uh-
     rin. Three syllables, modulated like a tape teaching English as a
    second language.
     Katherine and Rajni went out for lunch together, to a place with
     a stand-up order counter called Café Benedetto. Katherine found
    herself ravenous. She’d only had time in the morning for a bagel
    with cream cheese and strawberry jam, and midmorning she had a
    doughnut, which seemed to make her hungrier. She had intended
     to get the low-cal chicken Caesar salad, dressing on the side, but
    she ended up ordering the meatball sandwich with fries and a diet
    Coke. Rajni got the chicken Caesar and a bottle of Calistoga. She
    had worn a sari, as she sometimes did, iridescent blue with black-
     ish highlights, and she looked slender and elegant when she sat
    down. Katherine looked at her enviously across the table and sud-
    denly felt dumpy and defeated. She tore a bite out of her meatball
    sandwich and wiped her chin.
      “So did you and Heber have some kind of fight?” Rajni asked.
      “No,” Katherine said. “Why?” She stuffed three fries into her
    mouth. She was eating so poorly that she could serve as the Don’t
     Girl in a feature in More magazine—“Diet Do’s and Don’t’s.”
     “You've just been a bit peculiar with each other today.”

```

-----

```
    “Oh, he is,” Rajni agreed confidently and leaned forward. “I
  think it’s that Mormon thing.”
    “Oh, you think that’s it?”
   “They must keep the boys very separate from the girls. Just like
  some traditional Indian men. They know nothing about women.
  Imagine a wedding night with one of them.” She shivered in disgust.
   FOL?
    “And then he’s so geeky, don’t you think? Those glasses he
  wears are like goggles. Nobody has worn glasses like that since the
   seventies.”
    Katherine listened as Rajni continued to list Heber’s shortcom-
   ings. She had been feeling like she didn’t deserve Heber, like she
  was too old for him, like her female fat zones were too round, like
  everything on her body would start to sag in a year and he would
   find her unattractive. Now, listening to Rajni, glamorous and ele-
   gant, find fault with Heber, she began to wonder if he deserved her.
  Or maybe they were both just losers.
    Back in the office, she discreetly observed some of what Rajni
  had noted. The glasses for his nearsightedness that made his eyes
  appear tiny, his geeky way of chewing the caps on pens. But, in
   a manner that surprised her, everything she observed became
  endearing. She saw that he had shaved, but badly, and guessed
   that he had begged a disposable razor from the motel’s front desk
  and had tried to use soap lather [for ] [shaving ] [cream. ] [The ] [promi- ]
  nent mole below his left [ear ] [had ] [been ] [cut ] [and ] [looked ] [angry. ] [She ]
  had discovered that mole [while ] [nibbling ] [on ] [his ] [ear, ] [and ] [she ] [felt ]
  sorry for it and protective [of ][it. ][And ] [she ] [wondered ] [about ] [love ] [and ]
  whether part of the outrageous [promise ] [of ][it ][was ] [to ] [find ] [that ] [flaws ]
  made it grow. Was she [like ] [a ] [teenager, ] [willing ] [herself ] [to ] [be ] [blind ]
   to flaws and limitations? [Or ] [was ] [she ] [acting ] [maturely ] [to ] [embrace ]
  imperfections? She wasn’t sure.
    Heber lived in a subdivision in Tracy, an hour by freeway from
  San José. He’d bought a modest ranch house there, on the edge
  of the Great Central Valley, because it was the only place he could

```

-----

```
     he and Katherine could make the long drive to his house to be
     together and still allow Katherine time to return home and tend to
     her father and son.
      They didn’t meet that afternoon after work, and Katherine didn’t
     dare send him even an email love note. She’d heard too many sto-
     ries about emails at work becoming public. At home, she found
     that her father felt well enough to go with Carter to his rehears-
     als. He wanted to go. They could make it a driving lesson there
     and back, and Henry said he enjoyed watching the rehearsals, and
     Carter’s drama teacher welcomed him. That freed up Katherine’s
     time. She used her son’s computer to send Heber an instant mes-
     sage and suggested they see each other after work tomorrow. He
     replied almost immediately. She loved thinking of him sitting at
     his computer, waiting for her—she loved that she had fulfilled his
     wishes and expectations.
      They met at the El Rancho the next day, and the day after that.
     Katherine rushed home and put dinner on the table and then
     drove out to the motel to find him standing on the second-floor
    walkway outside an open door, waiting for her. What surprised
     her was the swift ferocity of his love, the way it seemed to have
     suddenly elevated itself into a vast monument. He was especially
    moved by her physical responses to him. Each quiet cry that she
     gave out as though from a distance, her eyes half-closed and her
     head turned to the right, the skin prickling at the base of her spine,
     seemed to leave him in a state of gratitude and wonder at becom-
     ing a lover, her lover. She tried to tell him that it was his inexperi-
     ence that made him feel that way. She tried to tell him that she was
     not unique, that any secrets she had were secrets common to all
    women, she tried to tell him that he thought she was unique only
     because he was so young—she wanted to ease what she thought
     sure would be the gradual fading of his enchantment. But he
     would not listen. He loved her, he said. And each small nuance of
     sex she showed him, each motion he could put into practice that
     brought her more pleasure, made him love her more.

```

-----

```
   The stories she sometimes read in newspapers, about schoolteach-
   ers falling in love with fifteen-year-old boys, made her think the
  women who did things like that were strange and extravagant
   creatures, who must have failed at some point in their lives. Now
   not only did she have a lover who was much younger, but he was
   furiously and naively in love with her, despite his thirty-one years.
    She had no one to talk to about him. She hadn’t had time to make
   any new friends in her father’s neighborhood, and she hadn’t lived
   long enough in Oak Commons to grow close to anyone. Talking with
   friends at work was impossible, of course. One week went by, and then
   another. Two weeks of love. She hardly thought about Scott, about the
   fact that her mad search for him had brought her together with Heber.
   She spoke with her mother, while driving to and from work, teased
   out the plusses and minuses of what was happening, talked about the
   possible consequences of having Heber in her life, the future. He was
   in love with her and wouldn’t want to share in just a corner of her life.
   He had already posted his résumé on Monster.com, so that he could
   change employers and avoid the awkwardness of an office romance.
    Katherine asked her mother whether her father had been her first
   love, whether that had made it special and precious, or whether she
   too had considered all the dunning practicalities of life. You'll do bet-
   ter than me, her mother had said. She asked her now if being able to
   fall in love again meant she was doing better.
    Her mother, as always, had no answer. So Katherine waited for an
   evening when she and Heber [were ] [taking ] [a ][night ][off ][and ] [Henry ] [and ]
   Carter were at drama rehearsal, [and ] [she ][called ] [her ][daughter ] [in ][Aptos. ]
    Katherine heard a bored note enter Betty’s voice as soon as she
   identified who had called her. She wondered if it was a special
   voice daughters cultivated to indicate that they were beyond the
   concerns their mothers had for them, but would humor them by
   pretending to take them seriously. Katherine hit the normal top-
   ics, updating Betty on her grandfather’s health, on Carter’s doings.
   She asked about work at the restaurant and asked her again about
   her plans to take classes at the community college beginning next

```

-----

```
    was thinking of moving on from her job if they didn’t start training
    her on the wok soon. Yes, she had signed up for two classes at the
    community college. There was no need to rush.
      Katherine wanted to talk about love, but she didn’t know how
     to bring it up. Her own emotions were utterly beyond the scope of
     their normal conversations. She had always played the mother’s
     role of placing her daughter’s welfare and happiness at the center
    and intent of their talks, and she was unused to placing herself at
    the center. So she asked about Betty’s boyfriend.
      Betty’s voice immediately grew guarded. “What about him?”
      “Well.” Katherine thought about the questions she had about
    Heber. Was he just naive? Was it only about sex? Was there a dif-
    ference if he loved her or if he just thought he loved her? Would he
    change with experience?
     “Do you think he’s committed to you?” she asked.
      “For now,” Betty said. “We’re not talking about getting married
     or anything.”
      “But do you think he could grow tired of you? Or too used to you?”
       “It’s not something I think about.”
      “But maybe you should,” Katherine said. “Were you his first?
    That would make a difference.”
      SMotherve.
     “He might decide he needs to experience more. And then where
    would that leave you?”
     “Mom, you’re asking me about my boyfriend’s sex life. Yuck.”
      “Oh.” Katherine looked down at the paper she’d been doodling
     on. She’d drawn a number of arrows with feathers and long shafts
    and arrowheads, and they all suddenly looked like penises to her.
     “I’m sorry.”
     “What are you being so weird for?”
      “Oh. No reason.”
      Betty’s voice hushed with a sudden suspicion. “Are you going
     out with someone yourself?”
      “Kind of.”

   find that it was someone at work who was more or less at the same
   level as Katherine, not some kind of Internet mogul. She asked
   what kind of dates they had gone on and was disdainful when she
   heard that at times they didn’t really go out at all. She advised her
   mother to think about what she was getting out of the relationship,
   how it benefited her.
     “I know what I’m getting out of my relationship,” she said. “And
   if I weren’t getting enough, I wouldn’t stay in it.”
    When they finished talking, Katherine wondered how she had
   raised someone who’d become so unsentimental so young. Betty
   knew what she was getting. Katherine envisioned her toting things
   up—the house by the ocean, no rent, a job she could take or leave,
   a lifestyle. Talking with Betty had only helped Katherine see things
   by contrast. Whatever sort of goodness she was gaining from Heber,
    it was a kind her daughter, at the age of eighteen, knew nothing of.
   Carter received emails from his father every day, and every day
   he read them and deleted them without replying. They showed
   up in his in-box from an aot account, with determinedly optimis-
    tic subject lines: “The Right [Stuff,” ] [“Going ] [Strong,” ] [“The ] [Time ] [Is ]
   Now.” And they contained [a ] [mixture ] [of ][reports ] [from ] [his ] [father’s ]
    life and advice and guidance [for ] [Carter. ] [His ] [father ] [told ] [him ] [that ]
   he spent every day engaged [in ] [an ] [“ambitious ] [project”—those ] [were ]
   his words—the exact nature [of ][which ] [was ] [difficult ] [to ] [describe, ] [but ]
   which would finally [bring ] [them ] [all ] [together ] [again. ] [Each ] [day, ] [he ]
   talked about the progress [on ] [his ] [project. ] [Then ] [he ] [advised ] [Carter ] [to ]
   start weight training and [perhaps ][join ][a ][dojo ][so ] [that ] [he ][could ] [learn ]
    tae kwon do, and [he ] [sometimes ] [attached ] [articles ] [he ] [found ] [online ]
   about strength [diets ] [and ] [supplements. ] [Once, ] [Carter ] [opened ] [an ]

   ing from a ninety-seven-pound [weakling ] [to ] [the ] [Hero ] [of ][the ] [Beach. ]
    Carter felt that his father wanted him to share these emails with
   his mother. He thought that his mother was the real addressee. His

    brought them to her. He never did. His mother was pulling away
    from him during those weeks, distracted, often gone, often disap-
    pearing right after dinner, giggling at odd moments when she was
     at the table with them. Carter resented this, used to being the focus
    of her attention. But he also enjoyed the independence that was
    unthinkingly being granted to him since the Fury showed up in the
    driveway.
      In the early evenings, just after his mother rushed off, he drove
     his grandfather to the rehearsal. Nu always greeted his grandfather
    with ceremony, seated him close to the stage next to where she sat,
    and made sure he was comfortable. When she was watching the
     actors run lines, she strode about, considering the blocking from
    various angles, sometimes calling a direction out of the darkness.
    But she frequently returned to Henry’s side, sometimes talking to
    him low and quiet, even while the action continued, sometimes
    asking him a question aloud, so that the actors in the scene and
    those not then onstage could hear what he had to say.
      Carter discovered that Nu’s embrace of his grandfather meant
    that he was accepted and welcomed by everyone. He was known
    now as the guy with the cool grandpa who came to rehearsals and
    was liked by Nu. Anytime he came to the picnic tables outside the
    theater, where Jeffrey and Cal held court, he was immediately part
    of the group. He was forgetting the awkward adjustment to Mon-
    talvo High, how out of place he’d felt with his antiwar T-shirt. He
    hadn’t worn the T-shirt since early October, and hadn’t felt the
    need to. It was easier for him at fifteen years of age to simply be
    with those who were against the war and have that understood,
    instead of wearing a shirt and being tossed into a Dumpster. He
    hadn’t had any more run-ins with K. J. and his buddies, since
     K. J. had been out of school with a broken leg.
     He saw Blossom Haven several times during the school days
    and again at rehearsals. She usually sought him out, running to
    him at lunch period and hugging him from the side. Face-to-face
    hugs were a little too explicitly sexual for the school grounds, but

   with her and hold hands or disappear for a time behind the the-
   ater building to talk. They talked about their families more than
   anything else, weaving together a common knowing of the past,
   and could have forgotten time in their talk if not for the clocklike
   appearance of Nu to smoke a cigarette that told them a section of
   rehearsal had ended. Sometimes, his grandfather came out to keep
   Nu company. After the rehearsal, he drove Blossom Haven home,
   with his grandfather stretched out in the seat beside him.
    He began driving the Fury to school in the mornings as well as
   using it to drive to rehearsals with his grandfather. He knew he
   didn’t officially have his license and wasn’t supposed to drive with-
   out his grandfather in the car. But it made sense to him in several
   ways. First, he knew the way perfectly, and it was safer during the
   day than at night. Second, he was saving time by driving instead
   of walking. Third, his mother was so distracted and was paying so
   little attention to him that he felt entitled. He decided that because
   she was rushing in and out of the house and he was hardly see-
   ing her, it was like she was giving him permission to do what he
   wanted, as long as she didn’t specifically tell him not to.
    The first time he did it, he had slept in after a late night and
   would have missed class if he walked. His mother was gone, and
   his grandfather was sleeping, and [he ][took ] [the ] [Fury ][without ] [asking ]
   anyone. When he came back [after ] [school, ] [his ] [grandfather ] [didn’t ]
   mention it, so it seemed to Carter [that ] [he ] [thought ] [it ][was ] [all ] [right. ]
   Carter didn’t test this thought [by ][actually ] [asking. ] [He ] [just ][took ] [the ]
   Fury again the next morning.
    That second day, he drove Blossom Haven to her home after
   school. She said that she hated being away from him, and some-
   times, when he dropped her off in the evening, she held his hand
   at her door and didn’t want to let go. He had to gradually slide his
   hand from her grasp, promising he’d talk to her the next morning,
   and then walk back to his grandfather snoozing in the Fury. He
   had never had someone else (a girl!) declare him to be so import-
   ant to her life, and it generated odd and conflicting feelings within

    given him the power to make her happy or unhappy. He hadn’t
    asked for these powers, and to have them rendered to him so com-
    pletely both pleased and confused him. He hadn’t asked to be her
    boyfriend, but now he was, recognized by the theater kids as part
    of a couple, and he carried his new status uneasily.
      She was happy when he told her he could drive her home after
     school. He had to park two blocks from the school, on a side street,
    and they walked together to the car, holding hands, each with a
    messenger bag slung from the opposite shoulder. She leaned
    against him as they walked, her head barely coming to his shoul-
     der, and he didn’t feel awkward or odd, didn’t hunch over to take
    up less space as had been his habit. When they reached the car,
    they flung their bags into the backseat, and then she leaned back
     against the passenger-side door.
      “Kiss my eyes,” she said. “I want to be the kind of person who is
    kissed on the eyes.”
      She closed her eyes, looked as if she were deep in a peaceful sleep.
     Carter ran a hand across her straight hair, dyed black, and along her
    round cheek. He was in love, as far as he knew, and that gesture
    seemed like something someone in love would do. Then he leaned
    down and gently touched his lips to each of her smooth eyelids.
      She smiled and opened her dark eyes.
      In the Fury, she told him to drive her home slowly, not on busy
     streets. When they were moving, she leaned across the broad bench
     seat and put her head in his lap. She kissed him through the cloth
     of his pants, pulled down his zipper, and then released that part of
    him that she thought most important to making him love her.
      “Guys like this,” she said.
      Carter drove, keeping his eyes ahead, and glancing down in
    wonder at what was happening to him. He swore to himself that
    he was in love, that he would always love her, that life was mirac-
     ulous. He felt an unconquerable happiness then, to know that she
     loved him, and to know that the happiness of their love would
     never end. Then he realized he was driving into a cul-de-sac. He

   fender nearly took out a mailbox, and a woman working in her
   garden looked up at him disapprovingly.
    He came back to the corner, which had a stop sign, and tapped
   the brakes quickly. Anytime the car stopped, he felt as though it
   became transparent, and everyone would see what was happen-
   ing. He drove around the subdivision, trying to keep in motion by
   avoiding major roads. A man walking a dog, a woman pushing a
   stroller, terrified him. They waved at him, and he waved back with
   a smile that he was sure looked guilty. He went ’round and ’round
   blocks of ranch houses with small green lawns and shade trees on
   the front strip, trying to keep his love secret and separate from the
   graphed landscape. Then at last, he leaned back his head, and the
   Fury sighed to a halt.
    By the time they reached the apartment complex where she
   lived with her mother, Blossom Haven was sitting beside Carter,
   leaning her head on his shoulder. She didn’t mind that the shoul-
   der was thin and that the bones were barely sheathed in skin. It
   was her shoulder to lean against, and she claimed it, and no one
   else could have it. After he parked, she held his hand.
    “Will you drive to school tomorrow?” she asked.
    “Yes,” he said. “Yes, I will.”
   A week later, Mitch spotted the Fury as it was pulling out from
   the curb. He recognized it immediately as the car he had seen at
   the theater. A Plymouth Fury, a big-ass American car with a peel-
   ing vinyl top that looked as though a cat had clawed it and rusted
   metal underneath. A squared off body, wide enough to hold a V8.
   Old California license plates, yellow lettering on blue. The body
   painted the color of lime Kool-Aid. And he was sure it was the
   same car that hit K. J.
    K. J. had suffered compound fractures in his leg from the hit-
   and-run, and he now had thirteen titanium screws in his tibia and
   fibula. After several painful operations and physical therapy, he

    asked was whether he’d recognized the driver or not.
     “Somebody from high school, I’m pretty sure. He had curly
     hair, and a girl with him. But I only saw it from the back.”
     “And you didn’t get the license plate.”
      “No.”
      “Shit.” K. J. thought for a second. “If it’s a guy from school, I bet
    he drives and parks in the same block most every day. See if you
     can spot it and make whose it is. ’ll be back in a couple of days,
    and we’ll figure out how to take care of him.”
     “Kay.”
      After Mitch left, K. J. took up his crutches and poled his way
    around the living room. He was ready to go back to school, past
     ready. He wanted to be back with his friends, back to being the
    smart kid in the group, the leader. He wanted to be back at his
    job, working as a busboy in a local steak house, getting a cut of
     the tips and sometimes a joint or two. He was sick of being the
     crip and sick of being stuck home. He hated his parents’ house.
    As he swung around on his crutches, he scowled at the frilly
    country-kitchen curtains his mother had put up and enjoyed, the
    decorative plates with yellow ducklings wearing blue ribbons, the
    handmade birdhouse painted orange that she decided would look
     cute, the two-dimensional wooden angels dressed in gingham
     skirts with aprons. He especially despised the little framed sayings
     she hung up in the kitchen and the front hallway—“Rule #1: Mom
     is always right. Rule #2: If Mom is not right, see Rule #1.” “The
    Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.” Some of them hand let-
     tered, some done in needlepoint and bought at craft fairs. All of
    them claiming without fear of contradiction that this was a happy
    family in a happy home.
      K. J.’s parents had bought this house—ranch style, three bed-
    rooms, one bath, built on a slab—in 1987, when his brother was
     three and he was a newborn. It was a Braden-built house in a six-
     ties suburb called “Revere Montclair,’ poorly planned and poorly
    constructed. But it was California real estate, and they’d felt like

  mother quit her job to be a full-time mother.
    Six years later, Moffett Field was closed, and K.J.’s father
  couldn’t find maintenance work that paid decently and had bene-
   fits, and his mother went to work as a secretary for the school dis-
   trict so that they could keep up with the mortgage. K. J. always had
   to wait, after first grade, for his unemployed father to pick him up.
  When his father finally found work, it was helping to lay carpets,
   truck and toolbox work, irregular hours. He later trained as a cable
   installer and worked hooking up houses for cable tv and then sat-
   ellite Tv and the Internet. But he didn’t work for one of the big
  companies that might have given him some security. Installation
  work was contracted out, to small companies that bid low against
  each other and kept a cap on wages.
    K. J. watched his father’s attitude toward the world, some-
   times anger, sometimes a certain bitter pride that he was making
   it despite the fact that the kind of job he’d thought he would have
  had vanished. He heard his father complain about how much a
  broken leg cost, how the insurance co-pays added up, how the
   system was rigged to soak normal people. And he had seen his
   brother, on graduating in the year 2000, look around and decide
   that the army was better than any other option he had.
    The broken leg forced K. J. to sit still, and he didn’t like it. He
   couldn’t make money at the restaurant. He couldn’t drive the car
  and talk to girls, or hang with his friends. And he wondered what
  would happen if the screws in his legs kept him out of the army.
  He refused to live like his father and feel screwed every day. And
   his friends felt the same about their old men. They all planned to
   go in a group and enlist together. K. J. didn’t know what he’d do if
  he couldn’t join up.
   When Mitch brought over the forbidden Grand Theft Auto
   to play while his parents were out, he began to dwell on that
   piece-of-shit car that ran him over and wish that the game was real
  and that he could hold an ak-47 or a Micro Uzi to the head of the
   driver, and tell him to get out, and watch him exit the car with his

     exactly the person he wanted to be.
      He’d been getting homework assignments over the computer,
     and his parents preferred that he spend time online instead of just
     playing games while he was recuperating. They thought as long
     as he was on the computer and it wasn’t pornography, he was
     learning something. So he began to search the Net for means of
     revenge. It gave him a goal while he was online. Pipe bombs. Tim-
     ing devices. The oxidizer and the combustible. The mechanics of
     explosions. None of it seemed difficult.
     Carter drove to school every day he thought he could get away
     with it. His grandfather didn’t seem to mind or perhaps didn’t
     notice. He’d had one more chemo session and was recovering
     and was usually still resting when Carter left for school. And his
    mother didn’t know, since she left for work early and came back
     late and seemed distracted when she was home. And it made Blos-
     som Haven very happy every time he said he could drive her home
     from school. They held hands during lunch, and she put her head
     in his lap on the way home, and then they sat with each other in
     the evening at rehearsals. His grandfather, when he wasn’t with
     Nu, looked upon them benevolently, like an old god who knew
     everything and was beyond approving or disapproving.
      One time, Blossom Haven invited him into the apartment where
     she lived with her mother. The apartment had no front hallway,
     and Carter noticed, as he walked in, that the living room had no
     sofa. There was a collapsible metal massage table near the counter
     that separated the kitchen area from the rest of the living room and
      a small Buddhist altar made up of brightly colored scarves draped
     over three tiers of cardboard boxes against one of the windowless
     walls. Purple and blue meditation pillows sat on the floor near
     the altar, and yoga mats were rolled up neatly in the corner. A low
     shelf held foam blocks and straps and eyebags for yoga practice,
     along with a small stereo to provide ambient music. There were

   sixties. Blossom Haven’s mother had never been at the Fillmore
  because she was only six when it closed, but she still felt nostalgia
   for times past.
   “Where do you sit?” Carter asked.
    “On the floor,” she said. She pulled up two of the squat medita-
   tion pillows near the altar and told Carter to sit on one while she
   lit two sticks of incense. Carter sat with his long legs crossed at the
   ankles and his bony knees sticking way out on either side. Blossom
  Haven instructed him to keep his back straight, like a tree growing
  toward heaven, and place his hands palm up over his knees. She
   sat down comfortably on a pillow beside his.
    “Now, concentrate on thinking about nothing.” Blossom Haven
   was trying to recall some of the things her mother said to begin
   meditation practice, but she knew she was leaving things out. “Your
  mind is like a monkey, always ready to scramble away. When it does
   that, notice it, and bring your monkey mind back to center.”
    “Okay.” Carter sat quietly and glanced sideways at Blossom
   Haven. She had her eyes [closed, ] [and ] [the ] [thumb ] [of ] [each ] [hand ]
  formed a circle with her index [finger. ] [Carter ] [touched ] [thumb ] [and ]
   forefinger in the same way. [He ] [found ] [himself ] [thinking ] [about ] [sex. ]
   He’d been masturbating [more ] [frequently ] [since ] [Blossom ] [Haven ] [had ]
   introduced him to [oral ] [sex. ] [He ] [wondered ] [if ][this ] [was ] [normal, ] [or ]
   if he was a pervert. [He ] [thought ] [sex ] [should ] [take ] [the ] [place ] [of ][mas- ]
   turbation, but it seemed [to ] [make ] [it ][worse. ] [The ] [more ] [sex ] [he ] [had, ]
   the more he wanted [it. ] [Was ] [that ] [normal? ] [The ] [morning ] [shower ]
   was the best time, [since ] [he ] [knew ] [nobody ] [would ] [disturb ] [him. ] [The ]
   rest of the day was [a ] [problem. ] [He ] [hated ] [sharing ] [a ] [bathroom ] [with ]
   his mother. He’d [had ] [his ] [own ] [bathroom ] [at ] [their ] [old ] [house ] [in ][Oak ]
  Commons, but [he ] [hadn’t ] [needed ] [it ][as ] [much ] [then ] [as ] [he ] [did ] [now. ]
   Having his own [bathroom ] [again ][would ] [be ][great. ] [Or ][being ][married. ]
    “Monkey Mind,” Blossom Haven said.
    “Qh.” Carter realized his pants were bulging out. He looked
   over at Blossom Haven. Her eyes were closed, and she breathed in
   and out with a deep sound from the back of her throat.

    had sent. The subject line simply read “Hi from Las Vegas.”
      Hi from Las Vegas. Hi from Las Vegas.
      Hi from Las Vegas.
      Hi.
      Minutes passed. From the center of the deleted message, an
    image of his father appeared. There were no words. Just his father,
     alone at a kitchen table. As Carter meditated, he realized that he
    recognized the kitchen table. It was a table with a fake wood grain,
    and they had that kitchen table not at the Oak Commons house but
     at the little house they had owned when Carter was born.
      His father was waiting for something. That’s what Carter felt
     as he concentrated on the image. He wondered whether he was
    remembering a specific time he had seen his father at that table,
    and what he was waiting for, or whether this was simply a general
     feeling that had floated up from thinking about what his father
    wanted from him.
      “Now,” Blossom Haven said, “think about someone you have
     trouble with. Bring them into the room and say, ‘May you be well,
    may you be happy.’”
      Carter brought himself back to concentrating on the image.
     Father waiting. For him? For his mother? For someone, something,
     to tell him he was well, his path was a right one? It would have
    been easier to have a father who simply knew he was well. But
    how many of those were there, really? Perhaps they were all filled
     with doubts, all waiting for self-assurance. And with his father,
    more than most, those needs were open and exposed.
      Father waiting. May you be well, may you be happy.
      He’d talked with Blossom Haven about her father. She didn’t
    know him well. He was an optician from Redding who had met
    her mother in Santa Cruz when they were both in their teens, and
    they broke up when she wasn’t willing to move with him back
     north. He had never understood that, for her, teaching yoga, giving
    massages, leading meditation groups, and joining in a drum circle
    weren’t things that she looked on as youthful activities she would

   from her mother by sending her Christmas and birthday gifts that
   might change her interests, like a microscope, a telescope, a book
   about being a successful teen. And when she wasn’t interested, he
   didn’t think to blame himself for not trying to understand her—he
   simply gave her the feeling that she didn’t meet his standards.
    Blossom Haven told Carter that his father was showing more
   interest in him than her father had ever shown in her. She would
   have been happy to have one message from him in six months.
   Carter’s father was trying, at least.
    Father waiting.
    Carter heard a small chime and opened his eyes. Blossom
   Haven had tapped a small tubular bell lying horizontal in a pol-
   ished wooden case to signal the end of meditation.
    “How was it?” she asked.
     “Great, I think.”
    “Youre the only guy who has ever wanted to meditate with me,”
   she said.
    Carter thought about the daily email message from his father.
   Every time he marked a message [for ] [the ] [trash ] [and ] [then ] [told ] [his ]
   email to dump the trash, he [saw ] [a ][dialogue ] [box ][pop ][up ][and ] [ask, ][“Are ]
   you sure you want to expunge [the ] [selected ] [messages?” ] [Expunge. ] [It ]
   seemed so much more [definitive ] [than ] [delete. ] [He’d ] [looked ] [it ][up ] [in ]
   the dictionary, and [it ][meant ] [to ] [obliterate ] [completely, ] [annihilate. ] [In ]
   other words, are you [sure ] [you ] [want ] [to ] [annihilate ] [the ] [selected ] [mes- ]
   sage? And the word came [from ] [Latin, ] [ex ] [= ] [out ][and ][pungere ] [= ] [to ][prick. ]
   Carter had smiled, [thinking ] [about ] [obliterating ] [the ] [old ] [prick. ] [And ]
   when the dialogue box [came ] [up, ] [he ][always ] [clicked ] [on ] [“Yes.” ]
    That evening after rehearsal, when he booted up his computer,
   he thought about reading the message. He didn’t tell himself he
   would answer it, didn’t promise to himself he would show it to his
   mother. But perhaps he wouldn’t expunge it. Maybe that’s what his
   meditation was telling him to do.
    He logged on to his email server and was astounded to find no
   message from his father. Nothing at all. His father had not missed a

```

```
    in his in-box. It was like a daily affirmation of his father’s need for
    him and his own power to choose whether to respond to that need
     or not. It was all right for him to choose to delete the messages
    and keep his father waiting. But he hadn’t foreseen that his father
    might have some choice in it as well. Carter felt betrayed.
     He checked his email account again in the morning before he
    drove to school. Nothing. At lunch, he and Blossom Haven sat
    cross-legged facing each other for fifteen minutes on a bench out-
    side the Drama Building, and he meditated on where his father
    might be. He began to wonder whether his father was in trouble,
     in danger, lost in the desert in Nevada. As he meditated, he saw a
    cartoonish image of his father, crawling on his hands and knees
    through a two-dimensional yellow sand landscape, a three-day
    growth of beard on his chin, his face haggard, his clothes tat-
    tered, a buzzard sitting on the branch of a nearby Joshua tree with
    black-eyed anticipation. That would explain the missing email.
      Carter talked with Blossom Haven that afternoon as they walked
    toward the Fury, trying to think through what might be happening
    with his father and how he should feel about it. He didn’t notice
    until they were on the same block as the car that two boys wearing
    hoodies and blue jeans were lounging against it.
     Mitch pushed his hood back, and their eyes met. Carter thought
    briefly about walking by them, pretending he had no connection
     to the car, but he saw from Mitch’s look of recognition that it was
    already too late. He had seen the way Carter reacted to them lean-
    ing arrogantly against the fenders.
      “It’s you?” Mitch exclaimed. “This is too fucking good.”
      “Yeah,” Brownie added.
      Carter stopped cautiously a short distance from the Fury. Blos-
    som Haven stayed half a step behind him. “What’s up?” he asked.
     “This your car?” Mitch asked.
     “What if it is?”
     “We're looking for the guy who was driving this car. Last
    month. The day K. J. got his leg broken.”

```

```
    Carter remembered the note from his father. The way the car
  gleamed on the driveway. Newly washed. Polished. Detailed. Clean
  of evidence.
    “If I know,” Carter said, “I’m not telling you.”
   “No?”
   “Why don’t you call the police if you think this is the car?”
    “We don’t need the cops,” Mitch said. “What do you think,
  Brownie? You think he knows?”
    “Yeah,” Brownie said.
    “Or maybe his girlfriend knows,” Mitch said. He used the word
  girlfriend as though he didn’t think too much of it. “What do you
   say, Blossom? You still like riding in cars with boys?”
    “No,” she said in a small voice.
    “Hey!” A man’s voice hailed them from the end of the block.
    Mr. Johnson was walking toward them with his always-energetic
   stride. Mr. Johnson worked at the high school, but the students
   didn’t know exactly what his position was. He didn’t seem to have
   an office, or if he did, nobody had ever seen him in it. He spent
   the school days walking around, keeping arguments from start-
   ing, keeping fights from breaking out, keeping couples from being
   too hands-on during school hours. He was always walking, with
   a fine round paunch swelling out a short-sleeved white shirt and
   a muddy-colored tie, showing up just before trouble broke out.
  He wore his black hair slicked back, accentuating his widow’s
  peak, and he had sharp black eyes and a sharp nose and a pene-
   trating voice. When he saw a boy and girl embracing, he relished
  the chance to call out in a loudly embarrassing way “Gettin’ pretty
  friendly!”
    Mr. Johnson lived in the neighborhood and walked to and
  from the school nearly every day [in ] [the ] [mild ] [California ] [autumn, ]
  and he’d never hesitated to carry [his ] [school-authority ] [voice ] [into ]
  the streets around the school. [Mitch ] [and ] [Brownie ] [stood ] [upright ]
   as he approached, put their [hands ] [in ] [their ] [pockets, ] [looked ] [at ] [the ]
  ground.

      “Mine,” Carter said.
      “You all leaving together?” He looked at Mitch and Brownie
    and kept them pinned with his eyes until Mitch scuffed the cement
    with his shoe.
      “Naw,” he said.
       “All right, then. You,” he said to Carter and Blossom Haven,
    “head out. And you two better walk on home.”
      Carter opened the door for Blossom Haven and then got into the
     driver’s seat. He was glad Mr. Johnson hadn’t thought about his
     age and asked to see his driver’s license. In the rearview mirror,
     he saw Mitch and Brownie slouch back in the direction of the high
     school and Mr. Johnson begin again with his quick stride.
      He drove Blossom Haven to her mother’s apartment, but they
     didn’t talk much. Carter felt humiliated that he needed Mr. John-
     son’s help to get into the car, and Blossom Haven had seen his pow-
     erlessness. And he was beginning to feel uncomfortable thinking
     about guys Blossom Haven had been with before him. He hadn’t
     thought about it before, but after Mitch asked her if she still liked
     riding in cars, he remembered her saying that he was the first guy
    who would meditate with her, and he remembered her saying Guys
     like this. What guys? How did she know?
     They said they’d see each other at rehearsal, but Carter was
     holding himself stiffly and Blossom Haven understood that a dis-
     tance had grown between them and she didn’t try to hug him.
      Carter drove through the quiet blocks of low ranch houses,
     past the one with the fake window shutters, past the one with the
    cement oriental lantern near a dry stone riverbed and a Japanese
     maple, past the small front lawns shaped with curvilinear cement
     edging and bordered by fall flowers and junipers. He wanted
     to speed, but the roads were a little too narrow and had gentle
     swerves at random intervals. He parked the car in the driveway
     of his grandfather’s house and leaped from the car and went
     directly to his computer, without even announcing he was home.

    Hi, Dad:
     Some boys today claimed that the Fury hit one of their
    friends and broke his leg. They say they recognized it.
    They’re like a gang, and they asked me who was driving the
     car, but I didn’t say anything. What happened? Can you come
    back?
      I miss you.
                                Carter

  : 10
    HENRY WAS DUE fora crt scan, and Carter stayed home from
    school to drive him. Henry teased his grandson about whether
    he could take a day away from his girlfriend, and Carter had
    turned quiet, but Henry took the long view of such things and
    thought that ups and downs between teenagers were nothing
    extraordinary.
      For Henry, a scan was at best a way to reset the clock. If he had
     a scan, and it showed the lesions on his liver were the same size,
    then he could believe that the chemo protocol he was on was good
     for another few months. He knew what palliative care meant, and
    he knew that treating cancer as a chronic disease was just a way
    of talking. It could be revealed as a flimsy stage set of a life any-
     time cancer cells stopped responding to treatment. He had already
    had two crises. The first when they thought they had completely
     killed the tumors through surgery and chemotherapy, used the
    magic word remission, stopped treatment altogether. In six weeks,
     the lesions were back, and he was put on a regular once-every-
    three-weeks regimen. The second when the cocktail of poisons
    stopped working and a scan showed two lesions on his liver grow-
    ing larger, and he had to switch to a new protocol, with a new set
    of pains to adjust to.
      But he had adjusted. Once, when he was with Nu behind the
     theater, he’d asked her why she liked being around an old wreck
     like him. Nu had looked up at him, raised an eyebrow.
      “You’ve obviously never been a sixty-year-old unattached woman,”
     she said drily.
      “So I’m the best of a poor lot.” They laughed, and Henry said,
     “Well, ’'ll take that. Can’t expect much more at my age.”
      He looked at her, the bright eyes in her lined face. “You know,
     the kind of surgery I’ve had done.”

```

-----

```
   That’s why I like being around you.”
    She’d told him something about himself there, and he knew
   it, Even with regular fathoms of pain, he still found the world
   an interesting place, and he was in no hurry to leave. He liked
   having his grandson around to surprise him with a girlfriend, he
   liked seeing his daughter fall in love in her forties, he liked look-
   ing forward to seeing Nu and laughed at the idea of smoking his
   first marijuana when he was eighty-one. He might find out, from
   today’s scan, that his clock was winding down, and there was no
   guarantee that a new protocol would work. But he might not. He
   didn’t want to let Caliban take away the savor of each day. There
   were so many reasons to live.
    He and Carter stopped by the break room to say hello to the
   oncology nurses before he checked in. Henry loved the nurses,
   especially Diane, who had been on the unit for many years. She
   was originally from New Orleans and still had some of that gentle
   lengthening of vowels in her speech, and she liked being bossy with
   her patients. “Now one day after treatment,” she would say, “one
   day can be a jammie day. You can stay in your jammies all day
   long and feel sorry for yourself. But after that, you get your ass
   out of bed!” Henry liked being bossed by her, in that accent, and
   liked talking back. “What if the spirit is willing, but the ass is
   weak?” he asked. And they could laugh, even when she was getting
   ready to hook him up to an intravenous drip through the Mediport
   implanted in his chest.
   When she knew that his condition was chronic and that he
   would be coming in on an ongoing basis, she gentled with him.
   “These others, I want them to see me as someone to get beyond.
   But you’ve got to like coming in to see me, so I’ll be nice to you.”
    Henry and Carter found her sitting on a plastic chair at a small
   table in the break room, [a ] [narrow ] [space ] [with ][a ][refrigerator ] [and ]
   microwave and two coffeemakers [that ][were ] [largely ][unused ] [since ] [a ]
   Starbucks had opened nearby. [When ] [she ] [saw ] [Henry, ] [her ] [plucked ]
   eyebrows, dyed red to match her hair, arced up.

```

```
     Henry smiled. “cr scan,” he said.
      “Qh.” She knew better than to say that she was sure everything
    would be fine or even that she hoped everything would be fine.
    She didn’t know how anything would be, and she didn’t want to
    be part of anyone’s disappointed hopes. And she knew that Henry
     didn’t expect her to say something bright and optimistic. Those
    kinds of words didn’t mean much.
     “And I thought I’d see who you liked at Golden Gate Fields
    today.” Henry knew she liked the races, and they always talked
    handicapping together.
     “Any horse being ridden by Russell Baze,” she said. “How are
     you, Carter?”
      “Fine, Carter said.
     “He has himself a girlfriend,” Henry said.
      “Well, that doesn’t surprise me a bit, handsome as he is,” she
     said. She liked making people blush.
     Henry gave her a little wave. “See you soon.”
      “You bet, honey,” she said.
      Carter walked with his grandfather to the counter and watched
    while he gave his information to a woman behind the desk, who
    printed out a small paper band and wrapped it around his wrist.
    Then his grandfather was escorted through some double swinging
     doors, wide enough for a gurney to fit through, and Carter walked
     to the waiting area he had grown used to in the time he’d been com-
     ing to the oncology unit. The waiting room, a beige-carpeted space
    open to the corridor, was hushed and calm. The area had a num-
     ber of cloth-covered sofas and love seats arranged around coffee
     tables and end tables spread with magazines. There were lamps on
     the end tables, but most of the light came from the banks of fluo-
     rescent bulbs overhead. Carter had developed a little ritual while
    waiting for his grandfather here. He walked a slow circle around
     the carpets, looking at the large framed posters on the wall that
    showed scenes of beauty, like a soaring eagle or a lighthouse shin-
    ing through a dark storm, with captions underneath counseling

```

```
  hospital traffic from here, and nothing could sneak up on him. He’d
   sat in this same spot every time, and so far his grandfather had been
   fine.
    Carter rarely spoke to anyone in the waiting area. Even though
   it was arranged to resemble a living room, each person seemed to
  hover within a self-contained sphere of anxious hopefulness, so
  Carter retreated within his own sphere, hiding behind a book. He
  had learned to watch but not be noticed watching when truly sick
  people were helped by or wheeled by, people whose faces were
  haunted and gaunt and hollow. When he saw a boy or girl walk by
  wearing a paper cap, he had learned to whisper /ewkemia to himself
  and avoid meeting their eyes. He kept lookout silently and subtly,
   and if he went unnoticed, it made him feel safe, as though he had
  kept something at bay.
   A television was suspended from the ceiling in one corner of the
   area, but it was muted, showing the face of Donald Rumsfeld with
  block letters appearing above his right ear. Carter watched his lips
  move, then settled in to his spot with the book he was reading for
  English class, Lord of the Flies. When his mother saw the book, she
  exclaimed that she had read the same book in high school. She
   couldn’t remember much, but she thought that a character named
  Piggy wore glasses, and that symbolized wisdom. When the glasses
  were broken, things went downhill. And she asked him if they
  were going to read A Separate Peace as well. Carter said he didn’t
  think so, and she said good, she’d hated that book.
    Carter began to read about the boys marooned on an island. It
  sounded cool, like that other book he liked about a boy who went
   to live in the woods and built himself a home inside a tree. He won-
  dered if the class was going [to ] [talk ] [about ] [it ][today. ] [He ] [would ] [miss ] [it. ]
  That would make two days [in ][a ][row ] [of ][class ] [he ][missed, ] [once ] [because ]
  he had faked feeling sick and [once ] [because ] [of ][his ] [grandfather. ] [He ]
  couldn’t keep skipping [school, ][just ][to ][avoid ] [K. ][J.’s ][crew. ] [But ][he ][didn’t ]
  know if it was better [to ] [drive ] [in ][the ] [car ] [they ][said ] [hit ][him ] [or ] [to ] [walk ]
  and try to escape notice [that ][way. ] [He ][remembered ] [being ][thrown ] [into ]

```

```
      He wondered about driving and Blossom Haven as well. If he
     walked, they wouldn’t be able to drive around together. But he’d
    begun to wonder just what she’d done with other boys before she
     got together with him. Why couldn’t he be the first boy she’d been
     with, just like she was the first girl he’d been with? Was someone’s
     love less love if it had been given before?
      He looked down at his book again. There was Piggy. Wisdom
     in a pair of glasses, knowing how to master fire. He grew into
     the book, reading and only occasionally glancing up at the quiet
     passage of hospital traffic along the polished tile corridor. Time
     passed, and there was his grandfather, smiling before him, and
     Carter marked his place in the book. They were leaving the hospi-
      tal, safe once more.
     Scott awoke in a tangle of six-hundred-thread-count sheets and
     was immediately aware of his penis. It felt as though an army of
     tiny men had spent the night jumping up and down on it. It felt as
     though someone had attached a block and tackle to it and stretched
     it out like an elastic band and then let it snap back and flap against
     his balls. It felt as though a clown had attached it to a helium tank
     and blown it up like a balloon and then tied knots in it so that it
     resembled a dachshund, before letting the air escape and seeing it
     deflate in a limp pfffft. He was usually completely unaware of his
     penis first thing in the morning except for the need to pee. At some
     point, waking up with an erection had been replaced by waking up
     with a bladder in undeniable stress. Perhaps that was a measure of
     age. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed and cradled him-
      self. In the dim light, it looked utterly normal and harmless. Yet
     every molecule of it seemed sentient and suffering and determined
     to ache its way into his consciousness.
      He stood up, disoriented. The room was filled with a half-light
     through the heavy drapes, and a dull thud and hum came from
    somewhere outside. He had no idea what time it was. He turned

  anchor him. An armoire with a television enclosed in the upper
  half. A chest of drawers. A table with two padded chairs near the
  window. A king-size bed with tiny lamps on matching night tables.
   It was growing familiar to him.
    He saw in the bed the rounded rump of Helen, covered in a
  white sheet, as she slept on her side with her back toward him. An
  odd sound exited her, something like a wet washcloth dropped on
  the floor.
    His pants were hitched carelessly over one of the padded chairs,
  and as he looked at them, an image formed in his head. An image
  of a large number of black chips at the cashier’s window. Placed
   in identical stacks, counted and recounted. Then hundred-dollar
   bills being counted out for him, piles of them. And his travel wallet
  growing bloated and gross with them and some of them going in
   the front pocket of that pair of pants.
    He lunged toward the chair and fell on his knees beside it.
  Helen gave out a snarfing sound. He groped at his pants, rum-
  pling them between his hands until he felt the comforting bulge
  of his wallet, the solid wad of cash in the pocket. It was there, all
   there, and he rocked back [onto ] [his ] [bare ] [buttocks. ] [Then, ] [quietly, ]
  he got dressed.
    Counted up on the table, the money amounted to more than
  twenty thousand dollars. More money than he’d had when he
  was paid off from his ship. He sat with his back to the curtained
  window, his pants now on, looking past the money to Helen still
   sleeping. He found himself speculating how long he could live in
   this hotel room, just live there. Something about the room, in its
  anonymity, in its interchangeability, in its complete lack of dis-
   tinctiveness, made it seem cut off from the past and the future. It
  had always existed as it did now, always would exist as it did at
   this present moment. How long could he stay, separated from past
   difficulties, severed from consequences? The room could contain
  such a life. How long, just living there, before something caught
   up with him?

     saw the boom of a construction crane, rising thirty stories from
     street level. Below, the noise of construction rumbled, carpenters
     building forms, welders placing rebar, cement trucks coming and
     going over the pounded earth. The sun was out, and the heat, even
     in November, seemed to fade and curl the mountained horizon,
     giving the land a weathered and yellowed look.
      He gathered up the cash and shoved some into the wallet he
    wore around his neck, the rest into his pockets and folding wallet.
    Then he leaned over the bed.
      “Helen,” he said quietly.
     “Mmmm.” Sleepily, she reached out and cupped a hand around
     his right buttock. He started back, but she held him with a positive
     force, so that he had to continue with his thighs pressed against
     the bed.
       “T’ll go down to the café and get us coffee and croissants,” he
     said. “And then we can go out for breakfast.”
     “Mmm-hmm.” She tightened her hold on him and pulled. Her
     fingers were burrowing to a region where no one’s fingers but his
    own and his proctologist’s had been for many years.
      “So should I go?” he asked, leaning forward to lessen the
     pressure.
     “Mmmm. Ysss.”
       SYesave
     “Mmm-hmm.”
      “Okay.” He reached back and loosened her death grip and then
     patted her hand. On his way to the door, he saw the black padded
     case that held his laptop. It seemed to beckon him, not with the file
     of his novel, Greatscott.doc, which he realized had only two words
     in it: Chapter One. Rather, it beckoned him with the promise of
     connection, beyond this hotel room, beyond the broad desert valley
     that held Las Vegas. He slipped it off the dresser and stole into the
     hallway, closing the door behind him with a firm pneumatic seal.
      The casino floor was quieter. Dealers stood attentively behind
     several blackjack tables, waiting for players, and only a single craps

  morning flight were playing. Scott walked back along Le Boule-
  vard, along the fake cobblestones and artificial trees, and found JJ’s
  Boulangerie, where he’d been so creative the day before. It wasn’t
  crowded, and when he asked for two croissants and two lattes to
   go, the barista told him to have a seat and she would bring the
   lattes out to him.
    As he waited, he decided it wouldn’t hurt to check email quick.
  Helen was still half asleep. He flipped open the laptop, and this
  time saw that he had a WiFi connection. While he was waiting for
   his login screen, he began munching on one of the croissants.
    His in-box showed a message entitled “Your Best Self.” It was
  from the workshop, cheerily encouraging everyone to reflect on
   the progress they had made that day, so they could build on it fur-
   ther. The next message had a subject line that read “Hi from Bette
  Cochran,” and even though his daughter’s name was misspelled,
  he thought it might be from her, so he opened it. A woman’s face
  appeared on the screen above the question “Would you like to see
  me? Click here for hot photos.”
    The barista brought his two lattes, glanced at the screen, then
  glanced away. Scott quickly pressed “Delete,” which brought up a
   screen offering to increase his [penis ] [size, ] [a ][prospect ] [that ][made ] [him ]
  involuntarily clamp his thighs together in a protective gesture.
    He dipped his half-eaten croissant into the latte and bit down.
   It was delicious, butter, milk [fats, ] [and ] [caffeine. ] [He ] [realized ] [he ][was ]
  famished and gobbled the rest down.
    Back in his in-box, he set about deleting spam without reading
   the messages. His filter was not working or needed updating, he
   decided.
   When he scrubbed one screen of new messages, a second screen
  appeared, and he saw the message from Carter. The subject line
   said “Help.”
    He felt himself suddenly breathing hard, and he grabbed the
  second croissant. He hadn’t received an email from his son since
  he had come to Las Vegas, but this one showed that he wasn’t

```

```
    guilty, stupid to have left that car with his family, naive to think
    nothing would come of it, whether or not it could be identified to
    the police. At the same time, he felt grateful to be called back into
    the drama of his family’s life by his son, grateful that the strange
    hiatus in Las Vegas was all coming to an end. He would rather be
    connected through error and crime than isolated and without con-
    sequence, and he wondered for a moment if he had left that car
    expecting at some point the very message he saw before him.
     He ate the rest of Helen’s croissant and made for the door of the
    casino. A taxi took him to a strip of used-car lots west of the Strip,
    places where cars were parked at the front of the lot with their
    hoods up and poster boards propped over their engines spelling
    out B-I-G s-A-L-E. He had the taxi cruise slowly until he saw it, a ’97
    Mustang, yellow with a black ragtop, gleaming on a grassy mound
    at the corner of the lot. Within an hour, paying out half his cash,
    he was on Interstate 15, driving southwest, aiming around the
    southern edge of Death Valley toward Barstow, Tehachapi, Bakers-
    field, and then over to Interstate 5 and up the long Central Valley
    of California until he could jump over to San José. To home.
    Carter noticed his grandfather walking a little more quickly than
   normal on their way out of the hospital. He didn’t have to slow
    his pace to walk beside his grandfather, as he normally did. They
   walked down the quiet corridors, past the pharmacy, past the line
    of wheelchairs waiting in the open and airy atrium, through two
    sets of sliding doors, and out onto the covered circular drive at the
    hospital entrance. Then his grandfather stopped and leaned over
    and braced his hands on his knees. He was breathing heavily.
     “Carter, can you bring the car around for your grandfather?” he
    asked.
     “Sure.” Carter hesitated. “Did you need to make an appoint-
   ment to find out about your results?”
     “There’s time enough for that,’ Henry said.

```
   news will wait, and bad news will refuse to go away.’” He patted
   Carter on the shoulder. “I’m sorry you never knew your grand-
   mother, Carter. She would have liked you.”
    They drove in quiet toward the house. Henry watched the strip
   malls and the big-box stores set back behind acres of asphalt pass
   by the windows. Carter’s show opened in a week, on a Thursday.
   He’d scheduled a chemo treatment for the Friday following. The
   bowling alley and the café were going out of business that week-
   end. He had a bad feeling about the cr scan he’d just had, and he
   wondered if he felt as good now as he ever would.
    “Why don’t you drop me at the Garden Spot?” he said. “One of
   my buddies will bring me home.”
    “You’re sure?” Carter asked.
    “You'll be safe enough driving six blocks,” Henry said. “And V’ll
   be home in time to go to rehearsal with you.”
    “Okay.”
    The parking lot of the bowling alley was nearly deserted, except
   for a little clot of cars around the entrance that led directly into the
   restaurant. The last league play had ended a few days earlier, and
   there was seldom much traffic in early afternoon. Carter pulled
   near the curb and watched his grandfather get out. He waited until
   he saw him walk up three steps, pull open the glass door, and step
   inside.
    When Carter turned down Catesby Street, a chunk of yellow
   disturbed his vision. It broke up the normal line of lawns, green
   hedges, leafy trees, the parklike setback behind which sat the ranch
   houses of the subdivision, the array of small landscapes he had
   grown used to. The yellow was [in ][his ] [driveway. ] [A ][yellow ][Mustang. ]
   And he knew who was leaning [his ] [butt ] [against ] [the ] [front ] [fender. ]
    Carter saw his father grin as he pulled the Fury alongside the
   curb. He was wearing khakis and a loose shirt open at the throat,
   like he’d just come from a resort, and Carter found the grin irk-
   some. It looked like he felt he should be congratulated just for
   showing up.

    in for the hug, masculine, all chest and shoulders.
     “Nice car,’ Carter said.
     “Yeah.” Scott gave another version of that self-satisfied smile. “I
    see you’ve been getting some use out of the Fury.”
     “I’ve got to be the one taking Grandpa to the hospital now,” Car-
    ter said. “He crashed his car.”
     “Was he hurt?”
     “No, but the car was totaled.”
     “Well, then, it’s even better that I left you the Fury.”
     He smiled again his irritating smile. Carter thought of all the
    things that had happened in the weeks since he’d seen his father.
   The pieces of his life were sliding like the floor of a fun house.
    His mother’s growing absences. The place he thought he was find-
    ing at the theater, helped by his grandfather. His worries about
    his grandfather’s health. Blossom Haven, the sudden commitment
    they had to each other, that he now didn’t trust. And the threat
    from the boys who identified the car.
     His father, standing now in front of him, seemed an unlikely
    choice to bring it all into order. He wondered now why he’d
    emailed him, when so much of it seemed to be his fault.
     “The Fury is great,” Carter said. “Except you ran somebody over
    with it.”
     “No, I didn’t.”
     “You didn’t?”
     “If somebody got hit, it was some other car. There must be lots
    of old Furies around.”
     Scott had been practicing that line on the drive from Las Vegas.
    Lots of Furies around.
     “Tons of em,” he continued. “Furies abound.” Even with prac-
    tice, it sounded like a lie.
     “They’re probably going to try to beat me up the next time I go
    to school.” Carter spoke in a tone that asked, What are you going to
    do about it?
     “They can’t prove anything.”

```

-----

```
    “Smart?” Carter asked skeptically.
    “Yes. Smart. Motivating success.” He said that they had to think
   through the obstacles that were standing in the way of their desired
   outcome. Once they had identified the obstacles, they could moti-
   vate themselves to overcome them.
    “So,” Scott said, “what’s the first obstacle?”
    Carter thought his father had gone a little crazy, wherever he’d
   been. But he had an idea. He thought about what Betty would do.
   She would turn this into a situation that could get her what she
   wanted. And what Carter wanted right now was the Mustang, It
   was almost new. It had a multidisk cp player. It wasn’t a beater car.
   It was probably faster than the Tiburon. It was cool.
    “The first obstacle is that they see me driving the car that broke
   K. j.’s leg,” Carter said.
    “The car they think broke his leg,” Scott corrected.
    “Okay,” Carter said, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.
    “So. You could not drive to school.”
    Carter gave him a look that told him that he’d made a sugges-
   tion that was stupid and without any merit whatsoever.
    “I was just thinking out loud,” Scott said. “Dreamstorming.”
    “At night? I have to drive to rehearsal. And I take Grandpa with
   me.” He explained that he was in The Tempest, and his grandfa-
   ther had become friends with his drama teacher. Not taking a car
   wasn’t an option.
    “It opens next week,” he said.
   “Mom can’t take you?”
    “Mom’s busy.”
    “Is she working late?”
    “I guess. She doesn’t say.” Carter didn’t want to let his father in
   on much. That’s how he thought Betty would operate. Once you let
  information out, you no longer have control over it.
    “She’s working too hard,” Scott said. “Does she know about
   these three boys? What they said about the car?”
      “No.”

    that he had committed a hit-and-run. And she would blame him
    for leaving the car for Carter to drive, even though it had obviously
    come in handy. She was inclined to think the worst of him right
   now and would take the word of some hoodlums over his. Even if
    they were telling the truth, that didn’t make it right.
      “T’ve got an idea, Dad,” Carter said.
     “Yeah?”
     “You could leave me the Mustang. You take the Fury.”
     “Oh. Huh.”
      “I know Mom would appreciate it. Even without knowing about
    the boys. The Mustang’s a lot newer, and I bet it’s more dependable.”
      “It’s newer all right.” Scott looked at the yellow Mustang, bright
    and shiny, and then over at the Fury, old hubcaps nicked up, the
    dull aqua green and the ripped vinyl roof. He had enjoyed driving
    the Mustang back from Las Vegas, enjoyed thinking of himself as
    a winner, someone who just won a new car at the craps tables and
    was now coming back to help his son out of a jam. He’d wondered,
    as he passed cars up on Interstate 5, if they saw him and wondered
    what his errand was, wondered about the glamour and drama of
    his life. He enjoyed thinking of himself through Carter’s eyes,
    thinking how he appeared, leaning against the fender of a shiny
    new Car, suave, calm.
      “It would take care of the first obstacle,” Carter said. “K. J. him-
    self hasn’t seen the Fury. He just came back to school yesterday.”
     SOV en
     “So then they really wouldn’t be able to prove anything,” Carter
    said. “They won’t do anything without K. J. telling them to. And if
    he isn’t sure, I’m safe.”
     “T want you to be safe, of course.”
      “I know you do, Dad.”
     Carter’s smile looked guileless and genuine. Scott began to feel
    trapped. He tried to think about some other way to overcome the
    first obstacle. Take Carter with him back to Vegas. Win enough to
    buy a second car. Return driving a pair of Mercedes.

   thing.”
    Carter nodded.
    “Promise you won’t tell your mother anything about these boys
   and what they’re saying.”
    “Okay.”
    “And promise you'll tell her that I wanted you to be safe. I’ll see
   her soon. We have to talk because I might be going back to Iraq.”
    ‘Tittelbner
    They exchanged keys, and Scott walked down the driveway to
   the Fury, the car he’d bought eight weeks earlier when he first got
   back to the States. Carter watched him go, the shirt seeming a little
    less elegant, clinging a bit to the curves of flesh on either side of his
   spine, the khakis bunched up around the belt loops in the back.
   The back of a man nearing fifty.
     “Hey, Dad.”
     Scott turned.
    “Mom bought a book on divorce. I saw her reading it.” After
   the car, Carter wanted [to ] [give ] [his ] [father ] [something ] [in ] [return. ] [“I ]
   thought you should know.”
     “Thanks,” Scott said. “I need to work on that.”
     Carter watched his father drive down the street, turn the cor-
    ner, head out of the subdivision on Country Lane Road. Then he
   walked all around the Mustang. He ran his hands down the fend-
    ers. He tried the key in the door, making it lock and unlock several
   times. He sat in the driver’s seat and put his key in the ignition.
    He wished he could see himself. He wished a movie camera was
   rolling that would show him in the driver’s seat, turning the key,
   hearing the engine roar to life. He wished everyone else could see
   him.
    That last part was easy. He looked at his watch and saw that
   school let out in fifteen minutes. He put the car in reverse, backed
    out onto the street, and drove to school.
    The Drama Building was set back from the street and parking
    lot, so he couldn’t drive by the benches where he’d expect Cal and

    He hadn’t talked with Blossom Haven for two days, since he
   dropped her off after their run-in with Mitch and Brownie. He’d
   missed one night of rehearsal, two days of school. He hadn’t
   emailed her or 1’d her or called her. He’d been embarrassed and
   uncertain and hurt, not thinking that she might feel the same. And
    if his solution for his feelings was to avoid her, he didn’t realize
    that she needed the opposite, to see him, to be assured by his pres-
    ence. But now, as he drove around the school, he realized that the
   person he most wanted to see was her and no other.
    He parked the Mustang on the same block where he had usu-
   ally parked the Fury, and he ran to the school grounds to find her,
   before she started walking home.
   As Carter was looking for Blossom Haven, K. J. was looking for
   him. He had been back in school for two days, and when class
   ended he gathered his crew into the Tiburon and cruised the streets
   surrounding the school grounds, looking for either the Fury that
   had hit him or for Carter, who could lead him to it. He believed
   Mitch, but he wanted to see the car with his own eyes before decid-
   ing what to do.
     K. J. was getting most of his ideas about honor, respect, and
   revenge from his brother. Before checking for homework, he
   always looked first for an email from Iraq, from Baqubah. His
   brother had told him things that he didn’t share with their parents.
    It was a goat fuck. Some soldiers in his battalion had been x1, and
   every night they were busting down doors, kicking ass and taking
   names, but they were never sure if the hajis they got were the right
   ones. They wanted an identifiable enemy—they wanted to close
   with the enemy and destroy him. They were infantry, and that’s
   what they were trained to do, close and destroy, not this bullshit.
    The first day back, he didn’t see Carter or the Fury. He drove
   with the others up and down the street where they’d spotted the
   Fury before, but didn’t find anything like it, and he drove along

```

-----

```
   again, and they tried to make jokes and keep everything light,
   but K. J. thought he needed an identifiable target to strike back at,
   just like his brother, and he was in a foul mood when they found
   nothing.
    The next day, on their second loop around, Brownie spotted
   Carter and Blossom Haven together, crossing the street away from
   school.
    “There they are,” he said.
     K. J. pulled the car to the curb. He saw them turn down the
   same side street where Mitch had seen them before.
     “Let’s give them a couple minutes,” he said. “Bet we catch them
   right by that piece-of-shit car.”
    They waited, tense and silent. Then K. J. pulled forward and
   turned right. There were many cars parked along the street and
   cars parked in the driveways between the squares of green lawn,
   and at first he didn’t see them. He thought he’d lost them in the
   landscape of cars, none of which resembled a 1977 Fury. But a
   block up, he saw two people standing, pausing beside a car, and
   one of them bend down to put a key in a door.
     “That’s them.”
    He stepped on the gas. He had a new walking cast on his left
   leg, and he thought himself lucky [that ] [he’d ] [never ] [needed ] [to ] [learn ]
   to drive a stick shift. He saw [the ] [two ] [people ] [turn ] [at ] [the ] [sound ] [of ]
   his engine, and he roared [beside ] [them ] [and ] [stepped ] [on ] [the ] [brakes. ]
    “What the fuck?” K. J. turned to look at Mitch. Carter and Blos-
   som Haven were standing beside a newish Ford Mustang, bright
   yellow, and they were staring at K. J.
    Mitch gave a bewildered shrug. “That’s not the car they were in
   before.”
     K. J. swung out of the driver’s side, leaving his door open. His
   car boxed in the Mustang, and he walked around the front of it,
   his leather jacket bulking over his shoulders. He still walked awk-
   wardly, unevenly.
    “Hey,” he said, “where’s your other car?”

```

-----

```
   pushing her inside and telling her to lock the door.
     “You know what I mean. That beater car you were driving two
   days ago.”
     “That old Fury?”
     “That’s it. The one that broke my leg.”
    “How do you know it was that one? There must be lots of old
    Furies around.” Carter heard his father’s lame line come out of his
   mouth. And, with a kind of wonder, he saw K. J. looked confused.
     “Lots of old Furies?”
     “Sure,” Carter said with increasing confidence. “Tons of ’em.
    Furies abound.”
    “When I see it,” K. J. said, “I’ll know.”
     “But you haven’t seen it yet.”
     “So where is it?”
     “I don’t know,” Carter said. “It’s my father’s car. He doesn’t live
   with us anymore.”
    “Where does he live?”
     “I don’t know. He might be going back to Iraq.” Carter didn’t
   know what to believe of what his father told him, but he saw how
    effective it was at baffling K. J., and he was momentarily pleased
   with his father.
     K. J. looked past Carter and Blossom Haven to where Mitch and
   Brownie stood. Mitch shrugged again. K. J.’s face pinched in ugly
    frustration. He pointed his eyes at Blossom Haven.
     “Hey, flower girl,” he smiled contemptuously. “You know where
    the car is? Bet you got a good look at it.”
    Blossom Haven shrank a little beside Carter. She’d been afraid
    this would come out. It was when she was thirteen that she
   found out older guys were interested in her. Because of the way
    she dressed, or because of the way she talked. And, growing up
   without a father, she was delighted that they paid attention to her,
   asked her to ride with them in their cars, got her high. Oral sex
    didn’t seem like much to give in return. It gave her personality
    a boost, and it made her popular with a certain group of boys.

```

```
   sonality began to ridicule her, and they found other thirteen- and
   fourteen-year-olds with good personalities. But she knew they
   hadn’t forgotten her, and at school there was a group, including
   K. J., who gave her leering, knowing looks.
    She looked up to Carter. Long-limbed, goofy Carter, who had
   come looking for her. He put his arm around her shoulder protec-
   tively, and she leaned against him.
    Behind the Tiburon, a giant suv with tires the size of small ele-
   phants and dark tinted windows pulled up. The driver gave a quick
   honk of his horn.
    Mitch closed the Tiburon’s doors, but the suv still couldn’t get
   by. It inched forward and stopped as its bumper, which was close
   to the level of the Tiburon’s roof, was about to run a crease through
   the smaller car.
    The driver honked again.
    “Okay, okay.” K. J. jerked back to the driver’s side of his car, and
   he and his crew got in. Then he glared through an open window.
    “Y’m going to find that other car,” he said. “Then P’ll be your
   daddy.” ;
    He started the car and screeched away, followed by the lumber-
   ing suv.
     Carter and Blossom Haven got into the Mustang. He’d wanted to
   impress her with the car. Now he [just ][wanted ] [to ][take ] [her ][safely ][home. ]
    He took her hand, to be sure of her, and stepped on the gas.

   THE EDUCATION Heber had received in Cedar City High School
   had not given him a sound understanding of female anatomy. The
    school, though public, was almost entirely Mormon, and discus-
    sion of sex usually centered around the notion that chastity was the
    best form of birth control, because it was both foolproof and part
    of God’s plan. At times, the gym teacher would read from a study
    that proved that condoms were ineffective against venereal disease.
    In halting speech, with his eyes on the paper, he informed them
    that the disease-carrying germs were smaller than sperm and could
    slip through the molecular barrier provided by latex. The analogy
   he used was that it was like trying to catch minnows in a basket-
    ball net. “The safest sex,” he ended, “is no sex.’ And he pursed
    his lips, looked out at the fourteen- and fifteen-year-old boys, and
   nodded approvingly at his own words. Once, he showed a series
    of old slides showing penises ravaged by syphilis, and for weeks
   afterward the most popular locker room insult was to call someone
    else a syphilitic dick. Heber later figured that the presentation was
   meant to discourage boys from driving to Las Vegas once they were
    old enough and losing their virginity with a prostitute in one of the
   economy motels off the Strip.
     Eventually, Heber gained an accurate account of what inter-
    course was, how children were conceived, how born. But he
   had still understood little until he knew Katherine. The pleasure
   she took with him made him think she was unique, one among
   women, even when she tried to convince him otherwise, and he
    felt he loved her completely. Yet whenever he thought himself
   becoming competent in his understanding of her, the messy com-
   plexities of the human body intruded. She began to talk frankly
   with him about her pains and cramps, the feelings of ovulation,
   the increasingly irregular and heavy flow of blood, the monthly

   he himself did, he was beginning to modify that notion, trying to
   grasp the concepts of cycles and moods.
    Currently, standing in the doorway of Room 12 of the El Ran-
   cho Motel, he was hearing about yeast infections for the first time
   and understanding that they weren’t going to make love that eve-
   ning. She was describing an itching, almost burning feeling, and
   something else. “It’s kind of like cottage cheese,” she said.
    “Oh.” He had trouble picturing this.
    “One-day creams never work for me,” she said. “I’ll try a
   three-day cream. That’s not too long to wait, is it?”
    “No, of course not.” He let himself fall back on the squishy
   bed, fully clothed, his arms stretched out to both sides. Katherine
   crawled beside him and rested her head on his chest, and they lay
   together, looking at the cheap furnishings on the wall. The walls
   of this room had prints of bullfights in flimsy brass-colored metal
   frames. Other rooms had images of the California missions, or the
   Napa Valley vineyards, or the redwood trees. Heber had held the
   notion that they would come back and always have the same room.
   He was already eager for [a ] semblance [of ][home ] [with ] [Katherine, ]
   even someplace as obviously temporary [and ] [conditional ] [as ] [a ] [road- ]
   side motel. But the El Rancho [didn’t ] [allow ] [anyone ] [to ] [reserve ] [indi- ]
   vidual rooms, and so they were [always ] [placed ][where ] [the ] [chance ] [of ]
   room occupancy allowed them.
    “Someday,” he said, “I’d like to spend the whole night with you.
   Wake up together.”
     “That would be nice,’ Katherine said. She moved her cheek
   against his chest, feeling the silk of his tie against her skin. She
   was glad once again she hadn’t spoiled anything. She didn’t like
   talking about her body with him, because he was so much younger
   than his thirty-one years. She wished she could be as free and
   spontaneous as her twenty-year-old self had been, when the body’s
   capacities had not yet begun to deviate from the mind’s desire, and
   she’d had no notion that they ever would. But she wasn’t, and so
   far it hadn’t driven him away.

     “T know.”
    He had been asking to meet her family. She temporized, changed
    the subject, in part because she wasn’t sure how to think of him.
   Boyfriend, lover, sexual pupil, fling, possible long-term partner?
   She wasn’t divorced yet, either, though that seemed just another
   way to evade the question, since her father had grown only more
   open and accepting with time, and Carter was old enough not to
   be bruised. And Betty . . . well, Betty was Betty. To make up for the
   lack of sex, she invited him to the opening night of Carter’s play.
   He could come as a friend from work, and then they could all go
   back to the house for ice cream. And they would see how things go.
    “How does that sound?” she asked. “This Thursday.”
   Two doors down, in Room 14, Scott lay on a motel bed in a posture
   similar to Heber’s, though without Katherine’s cheek against his
    chest. In his sickly imaginings, he saw all the different ways his
   wife was having sex with another man. Into his mind came step-
   ladders, chandeliers, trapeze swings, white silk handcuffs. It was
   nothing like the knowing married sex he’d had with her, a familiar
   path to a shared destination. It was happy and savage and cease-
    less. If he’d been in the next room, he would have held a water
   glass up to the wall, like he’d seen in old movies. The water glasses
    at the El Rancho were flimsy plastic, in a plastic wrapper to signify
   cleanliness, but he thought they would work just as well. This was
   the torment he sought out every night.
     Scott had begun trying to shadow Katherine after he exchanged
   cars with Carter. He didn’t know what else to do. He had accom-
   plished nothing in the nearly two months since he’d been back. He
   was again driving a 1977 Fury and living in a freeway motel, and
   he had about the same amount of money he’d had when he first
   got paid off his ship. He hadn’t made anything better with his wife.
   He hadn’t made anything better with his son, though he seemed
    to have unwittingly given him a car. He hadn’t written a book. He

   was almost up, and he had to make some kind of decision.
     Scott knew nothing about trying to follow another car without
   being spotted. In the movies, the streets were dark, spotted with
   the hanging globes of streetlamps that illuminated only themselves,
   and the cars were all black and high-fendered, blending with the
   night. But in Silicon Valley office developments, the parking lots
   were broad and flat, with trees too young to offer any shade still
   supported by cross braces in cement planters at the end of each
   row of yellow lines. There was no place to lie in wait.
    He found her Saturn in the lot outside spi, and he decided to
   park three rows over, next to a Hummer, so she wouldn’t walk past
   him on'the way out. He wasn’t sure he actually wanted to talk to
   her, because of what Carter had said about the divorce books. But
   he wanted to find out what Carter meant by saying she was always
   late, never at home.
    After five, people began to trickle out. There wasn’t a sudden
   rush. In Silicon Valley companies, people frequently worked into
   the evening. There was always some deadline, always some sense
   that a competitor would come out with a project first if you didn’t
   push yourself. And sometimes there was a competition to be the
   last one to leave, even after productive work had stopped, to prove
   who was the most committed.
    He spotted her around five thirty, walking out with two others,
   a woman and a man. He could tell it was her from a great distance
   by a gesture he knew, a way she had of holding up her arm and
   flipping her hand from the wrist in a dismissive way, to indicate
   that anything being discussed really wasn’t worth the bother. He
   loved that gesture. When she made it, she was in a good mood.
   When he was with her and she made that gesture, it meant that the
   things out there weren’t so very [important, ] [wouldn’t ] [come ] [between ]
   them.
    He missed that gesture.
    He was about to turn the key when he heard a rap at the window.
   He looked up and saw a fifty-year-old man wearing camo pants

```

-----

```
     Scott rolled down the window.
    “Hey!” the Hummer man said. “Cool ride!”
     “Thanks.” Scott looked up, to see if the Saturn was moving yet.
     “Got to have, what, the four-barrel 400 V8? That’s one hell of
    an engine.”
     eYeps
     “So what are you going to do? Strip it down and pimp it up? I
   know a guy.”
     “Sorry. Gotta run.”
     Scott turned the key and the engine roared.
    “Whoo-wee!” The Hummer man stepped back and listened
   admiringly. Scott saw the man’s mouth moving as he backed out,
   but he couldn’t make out what he was saying.
     Scott lost Katherine’s car before he left the parking lot. He was
   caught in a crawl of traffic nosing toward the one exit with a traffic
    light, and the Saturn slipped through on a yellow light while he
   was still twenty cars behind. He thought he saw her take a direc-
    tion away from the house on Catesby, but he couldn’t be sure.
   When he oozed out with the next light change, he took the nearest
   freeway entrance and gave his four-barrel 400 V8 engine the gas.
   He knew it was stupid to cruise the freeways, thinking he might
   encounter her car. It was still rush hour. The cars were moving,
   but the traffic was chunky, and he felt a great anonymity now on
    the road, not like the glamour he’d imagined driving back from
   Las Vegas. He felt like only one among a multitude.
     After an hour, he pulled off at the exit for the El Rancho Motel.
   He had taken a room there for a week, not knowing where else to
    go. And in the parking lot, completely unexpectedly, he saw the
   white Saturn. He knew the license plate. It was hers.
    He parked the Fury on the street behind the motel, and from his
   room on the second floor, he kept watch through vinyl blinds. Eve-
   ning darkened over the small asphalt parking area, stitched with
   shiny black lines of patching. The motel’s neon sign clicked on
   while he watched, and beyond the cyclone fence and shrubbery,

```

```
     The Saturn waited, alone and untouched.
     At eight thirty, he saw her. She had been in one of the rooms
   on the ground floor, and she had been with a man. He saw her
   squeeze the man’s hand before they parted, he toward a maroon
   Camry. Scott smiled with half his face. Katherine had never liked
   public displays of affection, ppas she called them. At least she hadn’t
   changed that for this other guy, whoever he was. Nights after that,
   he waited at the motel for her to arrive. Sometimes she did, arriving
    a little before or after the Camry. Sometimes she did not.
    He began to follow her home on the nights he spotted her at the
   El Rancho. He knew the route she would take from the motel to
   her father’s house, and he could quickly get the Fury moving after
   she had pulled out. He told himself he was escorting her, seeing
   her safely home. And when, after allowing a few minutes to pass,
   he drove by the house and saw the Saturn snug in the driveway, he
   breathed happily and thought her secure for the night.
     Sometimes, lying on the bed in his room, thinking about Kath-
   erine with another man, he wanted to break in, rise above them
   and hurl down words proving his own rightness. But whenever he
   imagined the scene, he found the words turning on himself. He
   had fallen so far short.
                              eee @eee
   On that Monday before the first performance of The Tempest, a
   storm swept in from the Pacific and lowered the sky over the Santa
   Clara Valley. The rains, absent every summer from California, fell
   darkly over the valley and darkened the streets and parking lots
   and rooftops. The water that fell on the shaped and paved land-
   scapes of the cities was shunted into gutters and drains and cul-
   verted streams, sent profligate into the bay.
    The yellow Mustang was parked in the handicap spot near the
   theater that evening, as it was during [every ] [rehearsal, ] [and ] [K. ][J. ][sat ]
   alone in his Tiburon one [block ] [away, ] [waiting. ] [He ] [still ] [had ] [not ]

    He had worked up a basic pipe bomb, easy to make. He drilled
   a small hole in the center of a threaded length of pipe, mauled a
   candle down to the wick to use as a fuse. Then he mixed potassium
   chlorate, used in chemistry class to produce oxygen, with sugar.
   He placed it in the pipe with some stones and nails, left some space
   free to allow it to pressurize, and then capped the other end. He
   found a plan for a delayed igniter on the Internet, using brake fluid
   and swimming pool purifier, which he had a kid whose house had
    a swimming pool get for him. He didn’t care if the bomb hurt any-
   one, as long as it scared them, as long as it showed that if anyone
   fucked with him, they’d get fucked with themselves.
     K. J. hadn’t actually tried out his bomb. But the Internet told
   him it would work, and he had complete faith in it.
   A little after eight, he began to see people trailing out from
   the theater. Then the Mustang nosed slowly between them, and
   K, J. turned the key and began to follow. He thought the dark pur-
   ple of his car would make it less distinguishable in the low weather.
    The Mustang first drove along the four-lane streets to Blossom
   Haven’s apartment. K. J. expected that. He knew where she lived.
   He didn’t know where Carter lived, since there was no house or
   phone number in his or his mother’s name, but he was going to
   find out. He drove past as the Mustang was maneuvering slowly
   into the lot that adjoined the apartment. The asphalt was liquid
   with rain, and as he slowed for a U-turn he could hear the water
   picked by his tires and swished against the underside of his car.
    The Mustang was ahead of him as he came back the other direc-
   tion, and he followed it as it turned right onto Country Lane Road
   and into the subdivision. Now it was easy. The streets were mostly
    at right angles, with an occasional curve or cul-de-sac. He saw it
   turn on Catesby and settle into a driveway.
    He drove around the block once, to get a slightly longer look
    at the house and double-check the address after Carter had gone
   inside, and he found himself following a white Saturn. The Saturn
   pulled into the driveway next to the Mustang, and K. J. once again

     He turned onto Catesby one last time and found himself look-
   ing at the wide, unmistakable rear end of a Plymouth Fury. There
   were the sharp body lines, the dinged and rusty fenders, the silvery
    rear bumper. There was the vinyl roof, clearly ripped and peeling
    back. It was the car that had hit him, he had no doubt.
     He saw the car slow past the house where Carter had parked. By
    the two streetlights on the block, he saw the man driving the car
   wave at the house, even though there was no one to wave back at
    him. Then the car sped up.
     K. J. lost the Fury on 101, heading north. He wasn’t sure if the
   Fury knew it was being followed or not. On the glary wet surface of
    the freeway, the traffic clotted and unclotted, and big trucks threw
    spinning shields of water beside them, and he peered through the
   wipers slapping at the liquid film, and in one moment the Fury
    disappeared. But he knew he’d made the car, and he knew he had
    his house.
   On Thursday, the day the play opened, the Garden Spot Café at the
    Blue Skies Bowl served food for the last time. Asbestos removal
   would begin within days, and [then ] [the ] [large ] [and ] [saurian ] [machines ]
   would move in on tank [treads, ] [equipped ] [with ] [pistons ] [and ] [jaw- ]
    like shovels and electromagnets [suspended ] [from ] [heavy ] [chain. ]
   They would chunk away [at ] [the ] [building, ] [crumbling ] [it ][into ] [pieces ]
    of concrete and twisted [metal ] [that ] [would ] [be ] [pushed ] [into ] [mounds ]
   by bulldozers, sorted [out ] [and ] [punched ] [into ] [smaller ] [pieces, ] [and ]
    finally dumped into [long ] [rust-striped ] [containers ] [to ] [be ] [trucked ]
    away. The mounds [would ] [grow ] [until ] [the ] [last ] [corner ] [of ][the ] [build- ]
    ing was demolished, [then ] [gradually ] [shrink ] [until ] [a ] [lone ] [bulldozer ]
   smoothed out the [soil, ] [and ] [grass ] [seed ] [and ] [fertilizer ] [were ] [spread ] [as ]

   orchards—cis, No Money Down!—but they paid no attention to the
   sign foretelling what would replace the Blue Sky Bowl. It was not
   directed at them. They ate the pastrami sandwiches on rye, the
   corned beef sandwiches, the roast beef with horseradish au jus
   they liked. Some, whose dentures weren’t up to deli meats, had
   rich tomato soup and crackers and cheese. And they talked over
   where they could meet now and then for lunch and coffee. Across
   the street, at the Western Horizons Shopping Town, there were
   only the chains—Starbucks, Olive Garden, Red Lobster. George
   Lee, who had been running the Garden Spot for twenty years, was
   retiring, or they all would have gone to wherever he was working.
   After he had served them all, he came from behind the counter and
   joined them, and they stayed through all the afternoon, telling sto-
   ries, making long the time before the doors finally closed.
    At five o’clock, Henry stood up and shook hands with everyone
   and said, “An attractive young woman is picking me up today.”
    They laughed. They shared the tales of their aging bodies among
   themselves, they knew who had a pacemaker and who was incon-
   tinent, and they knew about Henry’s radical prostate surgery. Two
   of them had had the same. But he told them to come and see for
   themselves.
    He walked out the door, stepped gingerly, felt the numbness on
   the soles of his feet cut like tiny knifepoints. As he walked down
   the concrete steps to the asphalt, Nu pulled up in her 1969 Ford
   Fairlane, red with a white top. She had washed it on the way to
   pick Henry up, and the chrome gleamed and the white stripe
   down the side shone. She got out of the car and stood up, her own
   red hair pulled back in a soft rope, wearing silver and turquoise
   around her neck and a loose white blouse.
    The men had expected to see Henry’s daughter, or perhaps
   granddaughter. They didn’t expect to see Nu, sixty years old, but
   lithe and limber, face lined and eyes bright. They watched, from
   the door of the exhausted coffeeshop. Nu stood near Henry as he
   lowered himself carefully into the white bench seat, then walked

```

```
    as the Fairlane sailed off for the opening night of The Tempest.
   In the house on Catesby Street, Katherine spread a new yellow
   tablecloth on the dining room table and set out spoons and paper
   napkins and cake forks and small plates and bowls. She put candles
   in the candlestick holders and a seasonal centerpiece of russet and
   gold leaves and golden apples and brown acorns. She had ice cream
   in the freezer and a cake from Safeway in the refrigerator decorated
   with a square-rigged ship and the words O Brave New World.
     Betty had allowed herself to be persuaded to come over High-
   way 17 from Santa Cruz for the play, feigning reluctance even after
   her mother told her that she wanted her to meet Heber. She helped
   smooth the tablecloth and opened the packages of oak-leaf-printed
   napkins with an amused smirk on her face.
     “This is so corny,” she said. “Is this what your new boyfriend
   likes?”
    “This is for your brother. Heber likes Mexican food. And
   blues bars.”
    “Hmmm.” Betty was skeptical. That sounded too cool for some-
   one dating her mother. “What kind of a name is Heber, anyway?”
     “It’s .. . his name.” Heber had told Katherine that his name was
   not uncommon in Utah and that there was actually an old trading
   center called Heber City east of [the ] [Wasatch ] [Front. ] [But ] [Katherine ]
   didn’t think that would impress her daughter.
    “Heber Grimshaw.” Betty shook her head as though baffled, and
   she went to the mirror in the front closet to inspect her new tattoo
   for the fourth time. She was wearing a low-cut pair of tight jeans
   and a stretchy top that rode up her midriff and left a couple of
   inches of bare skin. “I can wear Abercrombie and Fitch like you’re
   supposed to,” she’d told her mother. “No muffin top on me.” And,
   since the last time she’d seen Katherine, she had gotten a tattoo
   across the back of her hips, a black-and-red filigree that peeked
   partway over the waist of her jeans. She inspected it now, turning

```

```
    she’d gotten a tattoo. She’d simply made it a point to conspicuously
    consider it in front of her mother and see if she got any comments.
     Katherine said nothing about it. She hadn’t been asked what she
    thought, and so it was safer to say nothing. She couldn’t compli-
    ment it. She couldn’t help but see it as a sexual come-on, and she’d
    found out online that a tattoo there was called a “tramp stamp.”
    Complimenting her on it would be like complimenting her on hav-
    ing sex. Yuck, as Betty herself might say. Yet she couldn’t criticize
     it. She had given up on criticizing her daughter’s clothing even
    before she moved out, and criticizing her tattoo now would be like
    criticizing her for having sex.
     And Katherine wanted and needed her daughter’s approval.
    She’d first told Heber he could meet her family as a way to make
    him feel better, but now she wanted to bring him in and wanted
    the fractured circle of her family to form again. She wouldn’t pitch
     a fit over Betty’s tattoo, just as she didn’t over Carter meeting with
    Scott and now driving a Mustang. She needed both of them to
    understand and approve of her. So she’d welcome Betty, and her
    tattoo, and she’d welcome Carter’s nose-ringed fifteen-year-old.
    Her father wanted to bring the drama teacher, with whom he’d
    become friends, so she welcomed her too. She would welcome
    Scott as well, to come and settle things and not disappear. When
    Carter had told her about meeting him and exchanging cars, she
    found she was not so angry anymore—since Heber, perhaps—and
    she would welcome him in as a friend.
      “It’s too bad Ian couldn’t come,” she called over to her daughter.
     Betty raised her eyes from her butt.
      “I was not going to bring my Joyfriend to see my little brother in
    a high school play.”
     “He would have been perfectly welcome,’ Katherine said.
     “God,” Betty said, in perfect amazement at the simple-minded
    witlessness of mothers.
     The doorbell rang. Betty opened it immediately, before her
    mother could get there. Without saying hello, she surveyed the

```

   the chest. Not buff, not someone who worked out. Wearing an
   Eddie Bauer jacket and driving that Toyota Camry parked on the
    street, the most boring car ever. The only thing that made him at
    all interesting was that he was at least ten years younger than her
   mother.
     “Hello?” Heber said through the screen door. “Am I in the right
   place?”
    “Heber, come in. This is my daughter, Betty.” Katherine swooped
   in behind Betty and opened the door and drew Heber inside. “Betty,
   say hello.”
     “Hi,” Betty said in her already bored voice.
     “Hello, Betty. ’ve been looking forward to meeting you.”
    “Come in, come in,” Katherine said in an artificially high voice.
   “We have some time before we have to leave.”
     “So this is the house you grew up in.” Heber walked into the
   small living room.
      “It’s not much,” Katherine said.
     “No, it’s fine’ He went to the dining room table, set and deco-
    rated. “Hey, nice napkins,” he said. “You went all out.”
     Betty gave her mother a smirk.
   In the music room adjoining the theater, a bank of makeup mir-
    rors was set up on long folding tables, and the young actors were
   applying pancake with round [sponges, ] [penciling ] [in ] [their ] [eye- ]
   brows, aging themselves [with ] [crow’s ] [feet ] [and ] [lined ] [foreheads. ] [The ]
   boy playing Stephano, [the ] [drunk, ] [was ] [giving ] [himself ] [a ] [bulbous ]
   and reddened nose, while [Francisco ] [as ] [Prospero ] [was ] [whitening ] [his ]
   hair with spray color. [Behind ] [temporary ] [dividers, ] [students ] [were ]
   putting on doublets and [cloaks ] [and ] [long ] [embroidered ] [gowns, ] [and ]
   crowns and necklaces and rings.
    Henry sat apart, where Nu asked him to wait, out of the way.
   He watched Blossom Haven applying greenish and black makeup
    to the face of the monstrous Caliban, matching the frog-colored

```

```
    that first evening in the theater. He watched his grandson emerge
    from behind the divider, dressed in motley and wearing a fool’s
    cap, belled and tricolor.
     When Nu entered the room, thirty minutes before curtain time,
    the shouts and songs and invented Shakespearean insults quieted.
    She went to the music room’s grand piano and played a G major
    chord and held down the damper pedal, and as the sound wavered
    and held, all the actors gathered around her.
     She played a simple ascending and descending series of notes,
    and everyone warmed up their voices by singing along, deep, from
    the diaphragm. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Then she moved up a note, so
    that the sequence began a little higher. The actors sang along. She
    moved up again, and again. The young voices joined in a beautiful
    nonsense sound, each repetition a little higher and a little more
    energized. Then Nu began to move back down the keyboard, and
    the voices fell with her, growing deeper until she stopped where
    she began.
     “Magic circle,” she said.
     The cast and the crew, the actors and costume designers and
     set builders and sound and light specialists, everyone who was not
    engaged with taking tickets and ushering, crossed their arms in
    front of them and joined hands in a large circle. Nu drew Henry
    into the circle beside her, and he looked around at all the young
    people, some in the costume of the play, and some merely in
    the costume of the young. They were beautiful, he thought, and
    thought again how beautiful they were. How beauteous mankind
     is, Shakespeare had written. And the young believe, and believe
    that the world is new for them, and believe that they will get away
    with believing it forever.
     Nu began to speak, and said nothing to diminish the feeling
    within the circle. She spoke of the name of Shakespeare’s theater—
    the Globe—and how fitting it was, as Shakespeare had gathered all
    the passions of the world within it. She spoke of the first time she
    had played in Shakespeare, in a festival production in San Diego of

   had felt part of something large and joyful, where circles joined,
   where beginnings and endings met and made sense. And she told
   them what her director had said to the cast before opening.
    “For tonight, let there be, a Big, Fat Joy. That’s what he said.
   And now I’m passing it on to you. For tonight, let there be, a Big,
   Fat Joy.”
    She squeezed Henry’s hand, and he squeezed the hand of the
   young actor next to him. He thought about the disinfectant he
   would put on his hands in just a moment, that precaution of
   chemotherapy patients that nobody else in this circle would be
   concerned about.
    “Break a leg,” Nu said. And the circle broke apart, and each one
   went back to their role for the evening.
   The fuse K. J. had made was so primitive he assumed it would be
   untraceable. Two empty tin cans, duct-taped one on top of the
   other. He made a pinhole in the bottom of the upper one and a
   few tiny holes three-quarters of the way up the sides of the lower
   one. He would pour viscous brake fluid into the upper can, and it
   would slowly drip into the lower can, filling it. When the fluid in
   the lower can reached the holes in its side, it would gradually ooze
   through and crawl down [the ] [side ] [of ][the ] [can ] [to ] [the ] [swimming-pool ]
   chemicals. And react with them. [And ] [light ] [the ] [fuse ] [to ] [ignite ] [the ]
   pipe bomb.
    He had it all in a medium-size box, the size that might be used
   to deliver sweaters from a catalog. In the early evening, as The Tem-
   pest opened, he drove by the house on Catesby Street. The drive-
   way was empty, and the windows were dark except for one light
   in the living room picture window. There was no sign of life. He
   drove around the block once. The window again, still and square
   and illuminated behind drawn curtains.
    He drove to a small park that backed up against the Lawrence
   Expressway. The grassy field and play structures were deserted,

    brake fluid and poured it carefully into the top half of his fuse. The
     fluid rested, motionless, but he knew that it would eventually seep
    down into the lower half. Then he covered the top of the can with
     foil and sealed up the cardboard box with packing tape.
      At the house, he parked on the street to keep the box level.
    And he lifted it from the passenger’s side of the car and carried
     it between two hands to the front porch and placed it delicately
    under the wooden bench seat filled with terra-cotta pots. Like one
    of the many gifts to be delivered during the coming season.
     He planned to pick up his crew and return to see, if not the
    explosion itself, the aftermath. See, finally, the satisfaction of the
    payback.
    Henry saw his daughter standing near the ticket window, look-
    ing left and right, looking for him. There were people flowing
    slowly about her, parents and the younger brothers and sisters of
     the actors and crew, and high school students there to watch their
    friends. The plaza between the theater building and the other low
    classroom buildings was illuminated by tall lamps on green poles,
    each lamp diffusing its light under a cap of white metal, and people
    walked from light to light to the theater entrance under the broad
    overhanging eaves. Katherine stood still among them, between the
    pools of light and the open doorways, and Henry saw beside her
     the man who must be Heber, and he saw that if Katherine was
    looking for him, Heber was looking only at Katherine, attentive
     to her and her varying emotions. Betty was sitting on one of the
    bench seats around the cement planters, a knowing look of low
    expectations painted on her face.
     Henry greeted Heber with a handshake, and he called Betty to
     his side for a hug, as he had not seen her for two months. Kath-
    erine formally introduced Heber to Henry, and they shook hands
    again. Then Reverend Nancy appeared with her partner, and Kath-
    erine introduced Heber once more. Carter had told them he would

   were delighted to come.
    Henry looked at his watch. “We should go get seats.”
    In the theater, they sat together on a row of hard metal folding
   chairs and looked up to the gilded words: “The Theater of Califor-
   nia.” Then the house lights dimmed, and the stage curtain hissed
   up. A pale light showed a painted island, painted on the back wall
   behind the stage. The island was green and tall and distant, tinged
   with the dawn’s rose light trimming some clouds about the volca-
   nic heights, floating above a sea of impossible blue.
    Then the stage went black with a blast of thunder, and sailors
   shouted as they fought to keep their ship from capsizing in the
   foretold tempest.
   Outside the theater, from the far edge of the plaza, Scott had
   watched his wife greet Henry, introduce the man to him. His
   daughter was there, and he willed her to be difficult, to disrupt the
   dumb show taking place before him. To disrupt it on his behalf,
   knowingly or not. But she did not, and then the reverend showed
   up. He recognized her, and the spirit of amity that followed seemed
   to give a blessing to all that was [taking ] [place. ] [Scott ] [felt ][like ] [he ][was ]
   watching a scene from his own [life, ] [the ] [life ] [he ] [had ] [in ][the ] [past, ] [the ]
   life he was meant to be living at this moment.
    They went in together, through the dark double doors. Scott
   turned to the Fury in the parking lot, began driving, and without
   much thought found himself at the house on Catesby Street.
    He saw the same lighted window as K. J. The picture window,
   which was as much about presenting a picture to the neighborhood
   as it was about allowing the family within the house to look out-
   ward. Scott looked at it now, square and curtained and illuminated
   from inside, the smallish single-pane glass allotted to a postwar
   ranch, and he wanted to be sitting in the living room, with his family
   around him. In this house, this subdivision house that sheltered so
   many of the war’s generation, this house that was not even his own

     the Arabian Sea. Still sitting outside in an old car that was itself an
    expression of his nameless nostalgia for his blessed American life.
     He left the Fury parked on the street and walked along the side
    of the garage into the backyard. He still had the key on his ring,
    and it still fit. Nobody had thought to change the locks, even though
    someone had been getting in on a regular basis. Scott thought that
    was dumb, and it made him think again that Katherine needed him.
     He prowled the house, as he had done two months ago. His
    father-in-law’s room, dense and warm, his son’s room, with a bed
    and a computer, still looking like a room at a boarding school,
    something temporary and unsettled about the poster on the wall.
    Katherine’s room with the bunk bed, not a space of intimacy.
     On the hutch near the dining room table, he found the book
    on divorce that Katherine had bought at Borders. He laid it on
    the table and leafed through it. The underlinings and exclamation
    points ended after the first chapter.
      “Yes!” He made a fist and pulled it down toward himself in tri-
    umph. He was quite willing to believe that she had stopped read-
    ing after the first chapter because she had realized that she wanted
     to stay married to him. He looked for clues in the sorts of things
    she had marked and found, under “Divorce by Marriage Settle-
    ment Agreement,” a circle around “Good relationship with your
    ex-spouse, especially important when children are concerned.”
    That clearly pointed to someone who was having second thoughts.
     He picked up the book and took it into the sunken den and drew
    back the black metal curtain from the fireplace. The grate and the
    ash pan were blackened, and there were fire marks on the bricks at
     the rear, but he couldn’t tell when the last time a fire had been laid.
    He thought about burning the book, but he didn’t want to set the
    house on fire doing it. Totally counterproductive. It would be more
    meaningful if Katherine chose to burn it.
     He placed the book back on the hutch and decided to wait out-
    side for everyone to come home from the play. He wanted to be
    invited in. He looked around, made sure that he had not left on

   the knob, made sure it was locked, and let the screen door close
   behind him. They hadn’t left the porch light on, so he would have
    to wait in the dark, though he thought they would know he was
   here once they saw the Fury. Then he settled down on the wooden
   bench seat and leaned back to wait.
    He took no notice of the cardboard box placed innocently
   beneath him, with viscous brake fluid beginning to drip silently
   through a pinhole.
                                                      « @eese
   The play unscrolled across the stage, gradually revealing the tab-
   leau of the happy ending. Father Prospero manipulated the players
    until, one by one, they fulfilled their appointed roles. The king of
   Naples, who had helped conspire to rob Prospero of his dukedom,
   asked for forgiveness while agonizing over the loss of his son.
   The usurping duke, Prospero’s traitorous brother, was required to
   abdicate and return the rule of Milan to Prospero. The drunken
   plotters, Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, were punished by being
   dunked in horse piss and harried by hounds. The son of the king
   of Naples, against all his father’s expectations, was miraculously
    alive. And he had fallen deeply in love with Prospero’s daughter,
   Miranda.
     In harmony, the group departed the island to return to Italy,
   Prospero restored to his realm, [the ] [son ] [restored ] [to ] [the ] [father, ] [the ]
   lovers’ union promising [continuation, ] [fair ][issue, ] [life ] [triumphant. ]
    Did Henry see already the flaws in the happy ending? Did he
   wonder how the two lovers would feel when they had grown famil-
    iar to each other, when they had known each other for more than
   three hours, when each to the other is as common as an old coat?
   Did he notice that the traitorous brother is forgiven before asking
   mercy, and therefore remains unrepentant and malign? Did he
   consider that Caliban yet lives, half-human and at home nowhere,
   Prospero’s failure left behind to wonder at all he will never possess:
   Did he think about what the story would be if there were no Italy to

```

     Or did he choose to believe as Prospero might, in the hoped-for
    peace and reconciliation, in the complete happy ending? When
    the audience applauded, and the cast came out for a bow, he saw
    his grandson on the stage, unconquerably happy to be a few paces
    away from the young Blossom Haven, and next to him he saw his
    daughter sitting next to Heber, happy in the attenuated happiness
    she’d found. And they were coming home with him, for cake and
    ice cream. Believing was foolish, but it was the best he could do.
   When K. J. saw the Fury parked under the streetlamp in front of
    the low ranch house, he knew his plan was working perfectly. He
    had picked up Mitch and Brownie because he needed witnesses,
    and now he knew the real villain would be on the scene. Every-
    thing was falling into place.
     “This is dope,” K. J. said. He pulled the Tiburon in behind the Fury
    and left it idling. “That’s it, isn’t it? The one you saw Dipshit driving?”
     “For sure,” Mitch said. “Look at that roof. That’s it’ The roof of
    the Fury, flat metal showing through the ripped vinyl top, shone
    dull under the streetlamp’s quiet pool of light.
     “Piece-of-shit car.” K. J. got out of the Tiburon and hopped
    around the Fury. He sneered at the dings and scrapes on the long
    sheet-metal sides, the expansive hood, the chrome bumper pitted
    with rust. He had no doubt. This was the car that hit him. And
    its appearance here, on the very night he planted the bomb, con-
    vinced him that everything he had planned would work. The drip
    fuse would ignite at just the right time. Panic and revenge.
     He looked at the lighted picture window, the only light on in
    the house, one of a number of lighted picture windows along the
    street. Each one signaling to the others a sign of safety, stability,
    contentment. Each sign gathering power because of its replication
    in all the others.
     He felt like throwing a brick through the window. But his plan
    was more intelligent and fitting than that. And here was the Fury

```

-----

```
     “Hey!” A voice came from the darkened porch. K. J. turned to
    see a man walking down from the porch, right from where he had
    left the bomb.
     “Hey. If you’re looking for trouble, look for it with me.” Scott
    strutted down the walk, feeling confident and righteous. He knew
    these were the boys Carter had told him about, and as he got closer
    he recognized the skinny one, the one with the leather jacket, the
   one he had run down with his car. But he didn’t feel any guilt for
    that impulsive gesture at this moment. Now, he felt like he was
   defending the house, defending it from these young punks who
   knew nothing about what it meant.
    They were backing away from him, backing toward the still
    idling Tiburon. It was gratifying, the way they fell back, even
   though one of them was larger than he was. He felt like he was
   reasserting something, reclaiming something he had lost.
     K. J. opened the driver’s side door and posed there half in and half
    out. Scott stood beside the Fury and folded his arms across his chest.
     “Is this your house?” K. J. pointed toward the porch where the
   cardboard box sat.
     Scott felt he had some claim. Now more than ever. This street,
    this landscape of homes, this was his, this was where he belonged.
     “Yes. What’s it to you?”
     “It’s perfect.” K. J. ducked into the car, and Mitch and Brownie
   did the same. As Scott watched, the car backed up and then peeled
   down the blacktop, through the pools of light that fell on alternat-
   ing sides of the street.
     Scott watched it go, pleased with himself. He went back to the
   porch and wondered how he would tell Katherine about it, modest
   but still making clear he had done something bravely.

    gather around him. Katherine and Heber and Betty stood nearby,
    and Reverend Nancy. Then Carter, still in makeup and costume,
    brought Blossom Haven out to introduce her to everyone. Kather-
    ine made sure she was coming to the house, and even Betty smiled,
    though she thought to herself that this was just the kind of girl she
    would have expected her little brother to hook up with.
     Nu came out to be with them a moment. She would be the last
    one to leave the theater, but she promised to come as soon as she
    could. Blossom Haven asked if her mother could come. She would
    soon finish teaching her yoga class. Katherine said of course. Car-
     ter left to take off his makeup with cold cream and change clothes,
    and Henry said he would wait and ride with Carter in the Mus-
    tang. Katherine wanted to head home to make sure everything was
    ready, so she and Heber and Betty left first. Betty told her that of
    course everything was ready—what could have happened?—but
    Katherine said she wanted everything to be just right. Betty sighed.
    Just right was obviously of some higher order than simply ready.
     When the Saturn turned onto Catesby Street, Katherine saw the
    Fury parked under the light and thought that it was good. Every-
    one was coming home. She pulled into the driveway, and Heber
    gripped her arm.
      “Wait,” he said. “There’s someone on the porch.”
     “Don’t worry,” Katherine said.
     “Holy shit!” Betty said. “It’s Dad.” She began to wish she had
    brought her boyfriend. She was always bitching about her family,
    and this would have given him a chance to witness it all up close.
      Scott walked slowly toward the Saturn. Heber stood up from the
    passenger’s side, tense and watchful. The two men stopped, three
    feet from each other, while Betty draped herself over her open
    door, ready for a show. Then Katherine came around the car and
    touched Scott on the arm.
     “Come inside with us,” she said. “Cake and ice cream. Everyone
    will be here in a few minutes.”
     “Hi, Daddy,” Betty said.

    Scott glanced at Heber, thought he had at least that advantage of
   him, that he could tease his daughter and call her by a term of
   endearment.
    They all went into the house, and Katherine turned on lights
   and brought out the cake with “Brave New World” written on it
   and made the house into a bright and welcoming place. The porch
    light was turned on, and people came and were welcomed in. The
    reverend, the choir director, Henry, Carter, Blossom Haven, Nu.
    Ian, Betty’s boyfriend, came after she called him on her cell. When
    the cake was cut, they had a toast to Shakespeare, to the complete
   happy ending, to the comedy and continuance of life, to the lovers.
     But there was a silence in the room about the world they cele-
    brated and loved. Henry, ripe with the fall of his age, might act as
   though his friendship with Nu had quickened him, but his body
   would never let him fool himself for long. In a day, he would be
   poisoned again, and descend, and never rise as high as he was this
    night. Carter and Blossom Haven tripped along the cliff edge, still
    blithe as children about the possibility of stumbling, and Betty, so
    affectedly wise, had not noticed the unhappiness already growing
   within from her dependence on her boyfriend’s careless charity.
   Katherine now found herself unwillingly the author of heartsick-
    ness when she desired only to do kindness, as two men, each one
   needy and vain as men can be, waited on her. The reverend might
   hope that the house is just a figure of where we will all be gathered
    in, but Nu had not forgotten that this landscape in which we love
    is stuff and dreams.
     The first one to notice the fire was Blossom Haven’s mother, the
    old hippie who cobbled together a living for herself teaching yoga,
    belly dancing, kripalu, Reiki, being a bar wench at Renaissance
    Faires, leading meditation retreats to Mount Madonna. She had
   never been on Catesby Street [in ][her ][memory ] [and ] [had ][a ][general ] [aes- ]

     She had no idea that the house catching fire was the one where
    her daughter was at that moment eating ice cream in the midst of
    a flawed and makeshift family reunion. She turned into the first
    driveway on her right and ran to the front door and shouted for
    someone to call 911. It was the two-story house built over the tear-
    downs, and nobody answered because it was still an empty shell,
    unfurnished and unoccupied.
     She ran to the house on fire and saw lights on inside and was
    afraid to run to the front door because the fire was spreading to
    the soffit above the porch. She took off her shoe and threw it at the
    kitchen window, but it was a dancer’s flat, practically weightless,
    and it slapped against the window and fell into the fire.
     She picked up a landscaping stone, fist-size, and pitched it at
    the window.
     The glass shattered, and the stone thunked through into the
    kitchen sink. She saw a face appear at the window, at that most
    everyday place, where a woman washing dishes could look out on
    the neighborhood.
     The face changed from curious to terrified, and a moment later,
    she saw an old man swing open the front door, stare at the six-
    foot-tall flames, then slam the door shut.
     She ran to the next house over, wearing only one shoe, and
   hammered on the front door. An older man wearing sweatpants
    and a cardigan sweater opened the door and gaped at her.
     “Fire!” she yelled. “Call 911. Call 911.”
     Behind her, the pipe bomb popped and showered stones and
    nails into the flaming front porch.
    K. J.’s fuse had worked much better than his pipe bomb. It flashed
    and caught the cardboard box on fire, which had ignited the var-
    nished boards of the bench. The boards burned hot as kindling,
    kissed the siding with flames, and spread through the overhang to
    the roof timbers.

   trucks and police cars and a minivan from a local news channel.
    Great canvas hoses, fat and tense, squirm on the asphalt street, and
   the asphalt is dark and wet under her clogs. It’s cool under the pur-
   ple black sky, November in Northern California, and she pulls her
   black sweater closer around her.
     Several neighbors have invited her in, to wait out whatever would
   happen, but she wants to stay outside and watch, and say goodbye
    in that way. She watches streams of water crash onto the siding and
    fall over the roof of the neighboring house, the two-story house built
    over the teardowns—she watches the garage burning brightly, all of
    the family’s stagnant artifacts suddenly ripped into combustion and
   made into the ashen past. She sees that Henry has stayed outside
    too, with Nu, and Carter with Blossom Haven and her mother, and
   Betty with Ian. Heber is talking with a police officer, as she will have
    to do before long.
     Scott is no longer present. When they were standing outside, a
   purple Tiburon nosed into the block, then braked to a stop before
    the spectacle of people standing in a semicircle on the sidewalk,
   half their bodies oranged and warm from the light of the fire, half
    their bodies dark, casting dark stick-figure shadows behind them.
     Scott spotted the purple car and ran toward the Fury. He hadn’t
   found the chance, while everyone was eating cake and ice cream, to
    tell Katherine that he had protected the house, and he was glad he
   hadn’t. Now, as he saw the Tiburon backing out of Catesby Street,
   he shouted over his shoulder that he would be right back, that he
   would get them, though it was unclear to anyone who them was.
   And he roared off in pursuit, chasing the Tiburon with his Fury.
    He would drive all night, long after he’d lost the other car, long
    after the chase had proven futile. He would drive, chasing nothing
   he would ever find, but still chasing, unaware that he was acting
   out in miniature a figure for his entire life.
    Katherine drifts past the newsman combing his hair, past clumps
   of neighbors, walking slowly over the wet and glary street, keep-
   ing her head turned toward the burning house. Heber has finished

    everything around them in lurid yellows and oranges and leave
    everything outside their scope in black relief, she sees again her
    father standing on the roof. And that strange new landscape, the
    plain of roofs humped in shingle-covered peaks stretching forth
    within the newly platted, newly built-up subdivision, too new for
    trees to rise up and disrupt the single-story fact of it. She sees again
    the house as it appears in her dreams, her dream house of the past,
    with Daddy-protector on the roof, the house proof against all ills.
     She finds her father. Neither of them has forsaken the house with
    their gaze. Nu draws back gracefully, and Katherine puts her arm
    around her father’s waist and he puts his arm over her shoulder.
      “All that crap in the garage,” he says.
     “Yes,” she says.
     The others slowly gather around them, sons and daughters
    and friends and lovers, an arc between them and the darkness
    behind them.
     “What are you thinking of?” she asked.
     “Your mother. You?”
     “I’m thinking of you, on the roof.”
     Henry shakes his head. “We'll have to call your brothers.”
     “We'll find someplace together,” Katherine says. “Someplace
    temporary.”

   This novel owes much to my memory of a street in San José where
   two of my mother’s sisters lived with their families and where I vis-
    ited often. So my first thanks go to my family—my parents, uncles,
   aunts, brothers, cousins, nieces, nephews, and all.
     I'd like to thank the friends and fellow writers who read the
   manuscript along the way, especially Dorothy Solomon, Linden
   McNeilly, and Valerie Cohen. And special thanks to Alison Bond,
   for her many years of support.
    My thanks to the Vintage Hams of the ’7os. If they read the
   book, they’ll know why.
    While writing this novel, I spent time in archives reading about
   the history of the American suburb. As always, I thank the many
   librarians who helped point me in the right direction, including
