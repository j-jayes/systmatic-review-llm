#### INTRODUCTION

 Kay Saunders

##### If the systematic analysis of slavery and other forms of bonded or coerced labour has now become a dominant historical area of investigation it was not altogether neglected in the previous century. Herman Merivale delivered a series of influential lectures at Oxford between 1839 and 1841, during that crucial period of transition when Apprenticeship was abruptly terminated in the British former slave colonies and the Colonial Office and plantation owners sought to solve the labour problem. He demonstrated that a paradox existed whereby both a white settler society and slavery owed their economic foundations upon the same condition of scarce labour and plentiful land. A disciple of Adam Smith, he believed that freedom could be pursued if industrious white settlers migrated to the colonies where there was abundant land and where they could establish themselves as yeomen farmers. Yet if economic production was geared to the export of a tropical staple for an international market then necessarily these conditions did not apply. Instead, it was necessary to concentrate all available labour and capital on the most productive land which might be routinely exhausted. This system necessarily demanded a highly un-free form of labour.
 Yet, Merivale’s analysis and acute perceptions should still engage our attentions, for in some respects he may be regarded as a precursor to dependency theorists like George Beckford, R.I. Rhodes, J.D. Cockcroft, A.G. Frank and D.I. Johnson. His examination of the unequal exchange between the industrialised and non-industrialised nations as one crucial means by which underdevelopment is maintained prefigures recent more sophisticated arguments.
 A decade later, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, whom Karl Marx praised as ‘the most noted political economist’ of his period, tackled the crucial problem that Merivale suggests, namely the relationship between the availability of cheap land and the scarcity of labour. His solution that the price of land should be increased in order that labourers did not become petty proprietors applied predominately to colonies such as those in Australia and New Zealand. H.J. Nieboer’s classic analysis of the economic


-----

##### structures of slavery, published first in 1910, also addresses itself to the question of the crucial determinant of abundant land and scarce labour as a basis for New World slavery.
 It was with the publication in 1909 of the American historian, M.R. Coolidge’s path-breaking study entitled Chinese Immigration that scholarly attention focused upon the nature of indentured labour migration in the nineteenth century. Some fourteen years later, the Australian scholar, Persia C. Campbell wrote Chinese Coolie Emigration within the British Empire which concentrated upon their export to the British sugar colonies. Both of these volumes were descriptive in nature and barely challenged notions of imperial superiority. There the matter rested for some thirty years. Even in 1953, I.M. Cumpston’s Indians Overseas in British Territories’ 1834-1854 continued to portray Indian indentured servants in a passive role, for her emphasis remained upon the impact of British humanitarians, officials and politicians who loom large and omnipotent in her study. In a sense, she barely acknowledges the demise of the Empire, for her work firmly and almost uncritically mirrored many imperial assumptions.
 But at this very time when the supremacy and unquestioned validity of Western imperialism was increasingly confronted by liberal and colonial scholars, there appeared a new more critical genre of studies concerned with the immigration of Indian and Chinese bonded labourers to the sugar colonies and South Africa. For instance, C. Kondapi’s Indians Overseas, 1839-1949 heralded an important change of emphasis and approach by its sympathetic appraisal of the servants’ position. Even today, this book remains a standard introductory text, despite refinements produced by historians and social anthropologists engaged in more detailed area studies.
 By the 1960s, with the spread of national independence within former British colonies, there was a marked shift away from studies like Cumpston’s and even Kondapi’s. There now appeared a number of well- researched, thoughtful studies of the immigrant communities themselves, most notably K.L. Gillion’s Fiji’s Indian Migrants; a history to the end of indenture in 1920; K.S. Sandhu’s Indians in Malaya; some aspects of their immigration and settlement (1786-1957); Ravindra K. Jain’s South Indians on the Plantation Frontier in Malaya; J.S. Mangat’s A History of the Asians in East Africa, c 1886 to 1945 and C.Y. Choi’s Chinese Migration and Settlement in Australia. All these works concentrate upon the immigrants’ motives for enlistment, recruitment procedures, embarkation conditions as


-----

##### well as their material existence in the colonies. Often these predominant concerns were focused critically within a wider context of imperial policy whilst remaining sympathetic to the plight of the immigrants.
 Finally, Hugh Tinker’s study, A New System of Slavery: the Export of Indian Labour Overseas 1820-1920, published in 1974 stands head and shoulders above the rest, though its debt to previous historio-graphical tradition must be acknowledged. In that sense Tinker synthesises all previous interpretations for he not only sympathetically portrays the life experiences of the impoverished Indian emigrant but also places these fully within the context of Western - largely British - economic exploitation of the raw materials of the tropics. Tinker unequivocally argues (and this clearly distinguishes him from authors like Cumpston) that it was upon the labour of these workers that the vast overseas wealth of British capitalists was created. Moreover, his book is the most comprehensive and far-ranging in its scope, careful research and analysis.
 Almost co-terminous with it, there appeared a number of other crucial works emanating from differing traditions and with diverse preoccupations which have influenced current historiography specifically in the area of New World slavery and bonded labour. First, George Beckford’s Persistent Poverty. Underdevelopment in Plantation Economies of the Third World and J.D. Cockcroft, A.G. Frank and D.I. Johnson’s Dependency and Underdevelopment: Latin America’s Political Economy, both published in 1972, presented macro-economic structures of underdevelopment which allow the historians to focus upon a particular economic institution like the plantation and explain why such industrial and social similarities exist under slavery, indenture and supposedly free labour systems.
 Secondly, Robert VI. Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman’s challenging and controversial Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Slavery, published in 1974, heralded a move towards analysing slavery in terms of productivity. Then Eugene D. Genovese’s Roll, Jordan Roll: The World the Slaves Made, issued the following year, added important new dimensions - given its neo-marxist orientation - to the social historian’s preoccupation with the details of plantation life in the ante-bellum South. That year also, Barry Hindess and Paul Q. Hirst published another neo-marxist study, Pre- capitalist Modes of Production which attempted to delineate particular modes of production within specific historical contexts.

##### This present volume encompasses authors influenced by the Tinker school and the more radical neo-marxists. It primarily addresses itself to several crucial questions which may vary according to the period or the particularities of the region or industry under consideration. Namely: How did the British former slave colonies cope with abolition? What forms of labour, coerced and free, were experimented with and what were the implications of such devices? What patterns of servile labour were manifested in those areas like Fiji, Malaya, Queensland and South Africa where African chattel, New World bondage did not exist? Did the particular mode of production, namely tropical monoculture, determine and direct all forms of labour? Can this model be applied to other modes like gold- mining? These are the types of questions to which the authors address themselves diverse in preoccupation, location and scope.
 It should be stressed that the authors themselves emanate from varied intellectual traditions, some like Raymond Evans, M.D. North-Coombes, Peter Richardson and Kay Saunders being influenced by the newer neo- marxist approaches. Other writers like the social anthropologist, Ravindra K. Jain, for instance, cannot be read within this framework, for his interpretation would not align itself with studies like Maurice Bloch’s edition of Marxist Analyses and Social Anthropology or Maurice Godelier’s Perspectives in Marxist Anthropology. Peter Richardson, on the other hand, might be regarded as in the forefront of the Oxford school of radical Southern African historiography. Essentially these differences of perspective, rather than detracting from the overall coherence of the volume, allow for diversity of opinion and emphasis. Instead of simply focusing upon the political economy in one particular colony as area studies must necessarily do or upon patterns of migration and adaptation of various ethnic groups, this volume seeks to discover the cross-cultural institutional forms of bonded labour which occurred in the British Empire after 1835 until they were abolished by 1920.
 In a sense, this study can be divided into two interrelated sections - the first dealing with those colonies like Jamaica, British Guiana, Trinidad and Mauritius which possessed fully developed, enduring forms of New World slavery and those dealing with areas like Fiji, Malaya, Queensland and the Transvaal which did not. Only Evans, the Australian social historian, in his chapter on the nature of the Aboriginal coerced labour patterns attempts a thoroughgoing application of a definition of slavery to colonial Queensland.


-----

##### Essentially the problem of what constitutes slavery does not otherwise present itself as a crucial concern, for authors are not discussing traditional African or Asian modes unconnected with the New World plantation patterns which characterise the Caribbean-Mauritian experience. Evans’s original and controversial analysis (at least in terms of a specifically Australian historiography) brings to light important questions regarding the nature of societies like Queensland, normally portrayed as white’settler colonies’ like New Zealand and Canada. Both Evans and Saunders demonstrate that a uniqueness and brutal expediency operated in Queensland which linked it into the dominant labour exploitation pattern in the ex-slave colonies of the Empire.
 William A. Green contends in his chapter on Jamaica, that bonded labour migration, post 1834 became an imperial issue of some magnitude. He argues that any meaningful assessment of immigration to the sugar colonies must examine this question within the imperial context. Certainly too, the moral dilemmas posed by a commitment to forms of indentured servitude were fully appreciated by decision makers in the Colonial Office in the 1830s and 1840s, who were caught off guard by the premature termination of Apprenticeship in 1838. With the exodus of former slaves from the plantations and increasing competition from the slave grown product from Brazil and Cuba, the whole economic viability of the sugar colonies was severely challenged. Alan H. Adamson in his chapter on British Guiana, Marianne D. Ramesar in her analysis of Trinidad and M.D. North-Coombes in his chapter on Mauritius explore the implications of these complex processes. The period from 1834 to 1846 was to witness an extraordinary degree of desperation among the planters as the various types of bonded servile labour were experimented with, attesting both to the despair of the former slave holders and confusion in the minds of Colonial Office decision makers.
 In areas like St Kitts, Antigua and Barbados where there was little surplus land on to which emancipists could establish themselves as proto-peasants, free labour proved to be far cheaper and more efficient than slave labour. But in the larger colonies of the Caribbean and Mauritius, only the systematic and widespread process of indenture could reduce this ratio between land and labour. Consequently, the introduction of indentured labourers from Sierra Leone and the Courts of Commission in Havana and Rio de Janeiro was permitted for the Caribbean colonies, as well as free

##### blacks from the USA, to Jamaica, Portuguese Maderians and Chinese for British Guiana and Trinidad. As the South African economic historian M.D. North-Coombes demonstrates, the most abiding answer to the sugar colonies’ labour shortages had already been solved in distant Mauritius, where, by 1838, over 25, 000 Indians had been transported for work on the sugar estates. In her careful analysis of the economics of indenture in Trinidad, Marianne D. Ramesar shows how indenture allowed planters to manipulate all forms of available labour, whether bond or free, in order to depress wages and retard the development of an independent black peasantry. By adroitly employing this strategy in British Guiana and Mauritius, the plantocracy was able to ensure the pre-eminence of the plantation as a mode of production. So skilful was this strategy in Mauritius that it became Britain’s premier sugar colony by 1844, a position it did not relinquish throughout the nineteenth century.
 In considering the tropical producer colonies, Fiji, Malaya and Queensland, this crucial question of securing another form of servile labour to replace chattels does not emerge. Yet, as Brij V. Lai in his chapter on Fiji, Ravindra K. Jain on Malaya and Kay Saunders on the Queensland sugar industry all point out, it was the structure of the plantation itself which determined the forms and conditions of labour. This essential similarity between these situations and the Caribbean-Mauritius model confirms Beckford’s thesis concerning the structure and function of the plantation as the determinant of labour which cuts through cross-cultural and temporal variations. Both Raymond Evans and Kay Saunders demonstrate that Queensland did possess its own forms of quasi-slavery in the use of the dispossessed defeated Aborigines and the exiled transported British felons. Queensland was also unique in that, by transforming the structure of the plantation system in the 1880s, labour forms were also transformed, becoming based upon free white expensive unionised workers.
 Lastly, in his chapter on the Transvaal gold mining industry in the years 1904 to 1910, Peter Richardson shows how effectively British capitalists were able to exploit not only traditional sources of reserve labour from Portuguese East Africa but also established a highly efficient viable source from Northern China. This latter procedure was attempted in order to secure a cheap servile regimented labour force as well as a crucial element in the reorganisation of the industry following a crisis of accumulation during the Anglo-Boer war reconstruction period. Like Queensland, the Transvaal

#### Chapter One

 THE WEST INDIES AND INDENTURED LABOUR MIGRATION - THE JAMAICAN EXPERIENCE

 William A. Green

##### Jamaica was an important recipient of indentured labour, but unlike British Guiana or Trinidad, it could not claim that indentured labour saved its flagging sugar industry. Although indenture intruded deeply into the political and economic fabric of post-emancipation Jamaican society, neither the historical course nor the demographic character of the island was substantially altered by the introduction of bonded workers. Among the four major British Caribbean colonies Jamaica stands apart.[1] It was the most prominent, most populous, and most troubled of Britain’s West Indian dependencies, and its economic development in the half century following the abolition of slavery was as disappointing as it was different from that of the other leading Caribbean colonies. This chapter will emphasise the distinctive qualities of Jamaica’s involvement with indentured labour as well as the broader ethical issues which that migration implied for the British Empire.
 Among the leading British colonies, the distinctiveness of Jamaica is often ignored. Geographically, the island was removed nearly 1, 000 miles from the nearest British plantation colony, a distance that precluded an easy seasonal movement of labour like that which persisted in the Lesser Antilles after emancipation. In contrast to Barbados, a small, low-lying, entirely settled island, Jamaica was large and mountainous and possessed vast tracts of unsettled upland. Although Trinidad has many topographical similarities to Jamaica, it is considerably less mountainous. British Guiana, of course, is continental, and in the nineteenth century its settled areas were entirely within the tidewater belt. Like Barbados, Jamaica enjoyed a long history of British settlement. Trinidad and British Guiana, on the other hand, were acquired by conquest at the turn of the nineteenth century. In Trinidad, most labouring people spoke patois French or Spanish; in Guiana, Dutch influence persisted well into the nineteenth century. Unlike Trinidad or


-----

##### British Guiana (both Crown colonies), Jamaica was a self-governing legislative colony until the crisis of 1865, and its governor exerted less control over local affairs than any other in the West Indies.
 Jamaica was the only major Caribbean colony whose sugar exports suffered steady, steep decline in the half-century following emancipation. By World War I, Jamaica was exporting less than one-quarter the amount of sugar it shipped in the final decade of slavery. Over the same period, Trinidad, Barbados and British Guiana substantially increased their output.[2]
 During intervening years, the demographic structure of Trinidad and British Guiana changed dramatically by virtue of bonded, particularly East Indian immigration. Barbados received no indentured labour. Jamaica acquired about 50, 000 immigrant workers, but the effect of this labour was limited. In Jamaica, as in Barbados, the flight of workers to other countries caused heavier demographic impact than immigration.
 For analytical purposes, the history of indentured labour migration to Jamaica can be divided at the mid-1860s. In the early period, the colony struggled to preserve its plantation structure, experimented with various immigration schemes, then declined precipitously under the pressure of free trade. The later period coincides with the era of Crown colony government when immigration for all recipient colonies was confined very largely to indentured Asians. Though somewhat less than half of Jamaica’s bonded workers arrived before 1865, the island’s experience with immigrant labour in the early period was the most distinctive and the most interesting.
 It remains a moot point whether bonded labour migration to Jamaica was necessary. Whether it was successful is also a matter of perspective, but at best its success was marginal. Why then was it undertaken? To answer this question one ought not to focus exclusively on a single colony, its condition, or the demands of its planter class. Bonded labour migration became an imperial issue of some magnitude, and any meaningful assessment of immigration to the sugar colonies must examine the question in an imperial context. If indentured labour migration has become, retrospectively, a cause for substantial moral indignation in the twentieth century, it was not lacking in weighty moral overtones in the nineteenth. Clearly, our low tolerance for the concept of indentured labour is not founded upon superior morality but on the altered form of our social goals. Schemes for transporting large numbers of African or Asian indentured workers to Jamaica were adopted by the imperial government with


-----

##### reluctance, with anxiety concerning the ethical rectitude of the process, and at very considerable cost. Such projects were instituted only because the practical and moral liabilities of bonded labour migration appeared less worrisome than the burdens to be borne if no such migration was undertaken.
 From the beginning of Apprenticeship,[3] Jamaica’s planters anticipated serious, if not destructive, labour shortages upon the advent of full freedom. There was abundant vacant land in the island to which the liberated population might repair to pursue peasant farming. In fact, Jamaica’s ex- slaves were already proto-peasants: not only had they sustained most of their own food needs by cultivating provisions on estate backlands, they had maintained a vigorous local marketing system for the exchange of surpluses. Apprentices clearly preferred the cultivation of food crops to the more demanding and more demeaning production of export staples, and there was little doubt in the minds of planters that large numbers of women and children would withdraw from staple agriculture when full freedom arrived. Only by the enactment and systematic enforcement of rigorous labour and vagrancy laws did the planters hope to stem the expected flight of freedpersons from estate labour. And only by the systematic introduction of immigrant workers did they conceive it possible to generate sufficient competition for wages to preserve regular and disciplined labour at acceptable cost. The planters came to these conclusions without the philosophical aid of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, though his theories on colonial settlement, at the height of their popularity in the 1830s, dovetailed precisely with the logic of the Jamaicans.
 To the planters’ dismay, Wakefield’s views were no match for the power of British humanitarianism in the formulation and conduct of West India policy. Having created one of the most successful political pressure groups in parliamentary history, British abolitionists brought an end to colonial slavery, then broadened their perspective to include protection of aborigines living in remote areas of the imperial frontier. Their principal focus of attention remained the British Caribbean where scores of anti-slavery activists monitored the conduct of Apprenticeship, incessantly bombarding the Colonial Office with criticism, advice, information, and misinformation. The continuing power of the abolitionist lobby can best be measured by its ability, through carefully orchestrated political agitation, to force the premature termination of Apprenticeship in 1838.

##### Though profoundly irritated by the verbal excesses of anti-slavery spokesmen. Colonial Office authorities shared many of their fundamental biases. They considered colonial legislatures highly suspect; those bodies had to be watched, constrained, and censured if the liberties accorded the Negro population by the Emancipation Act were to be guaranteed. The commanding figure at the Colonial Office in the late ‘thirties was its permanent undersecretary, James Stephen, son of a leading abolitionist, brother of another, and husband of Catherine Venn whose father had been Rector of Clapham in the heyday of the Clapham Sect.[4] Wise, diligent, and humane, Stephen quietly dominated Lord Glenelg, the sluggish Secretary of State, 1835 to 1839. Henry Taylor, chief clerk in the West India Department, though more pragmatic than Stephen, was equally suspicious of the planters and strongly disposed toward the assertion of imperial authority in colonial government as a means of ensuring the civil rights of the freed population.
 The imperial government was caught off guard by the abolition of Apprenticeship two years ahead of schedule. The legal machinery required to sustain a free society in the British Caribbean was not in place, and the Colonial Office was compelled, in haste, to create a series of model codes on various aspects of colonial governance which it insisted that West Indian legislatures emulate in the preparation of local law. In critical areas of labour law - particularly in the formulation of masters and servants and vagrancy laws by which planters hoped to deter the withdrawal of freedpersons from estates - the Colonial Office demanded more lenient terms than those applying in the statutes of the Mother Country.[5] In matters affecting immigration, imperial policy dampened the prospects of the planters. Colonists were forbidden to establish labour contracts with immigrants outside the colonies, and contracts adopted within the sugar colonies were limited to a single year. The planters were outraged. Not only had they been deprived, without compensation, of two years of coerced labour, they were prevented from using colonial law either to bind freemen and women to the plantations or to attract significant quantities of immigrant labour from abroad.
 Throughout the Glenelg years, the Colonial Office carefully delimited the regions from which labour migrants could be conveyed to the free West Indies. The Mixed Commission Courts at Havana and Rio were considered acceptable sources of immigrant labour, but neither generated a significant


-----

##### flow of free workers. Beginning in 1835, Jamaica provided a public bounty from colonial government funds to be paid on immigrants introduced to the colony from Europe and North America. Both sources were acceptable to the Colonial Office since people from these areas were deemed fully capable of caring for themselves. Europeans, it was thought, would thrive in Jamaica’s higher elevations, raising food for the colony’s lowland markets. Their presence might discourage freedmen and women from settling in highland regions, and their products would help feed free workers who remained on the estates.[6] Though about 2, 400 Europeans entered the island by 1840,[7] they were unwilling to remain in the highlands; they were not, as a rule, suited to agricultural labour; and they died in large numbers. A few returned home; others fled the colony for the United States. In North America, free coloured people of prime working age - presumed to number around 35, 000 - were vigorously recruited by agents from Jamaica, Trinidad, and British Guiana. Some Americans ventured to the Caribbean, but few stayed. Trained to the trades and domestic service, they found the rigours of cane culture entirely unsupportable. By mid-1840, colonial recruitment in the United States ceased.
 Throughout the Apprenticeship, West Indians had petitioned the Colonial Office for permission to introduce immigrant labour from West Africa. The Colonial Office firmly rejected all such proposals. A government which had long struggled to destroy the Atlantic slave trade could not, at least at that point, countenance the prospect of British ships conveying African labour across the ‘Middle Passage’ to British tropical plantations. Such action would evoke cries of hypocrisy from continentals, while providing unscrupulous governments a precedent for legalising the slave trade under the guise of ‘emigration’. Britain’s first priority was the establishment of meaningful freedom for the emancipated population. Authorities at Downing Street were concerned that free labour might not sustain the plantation economy at its former level, but they discounted the darkest predictions of the planters. Moreover, not until the first harvest had been taken by emancipists would reliable evidence be forthcoming on the prospects of the free labour economy.
 By 1840, preliminary evidence was in hand: it pointed to serious trouble in the sugar colonies. The grim forebodings of the planters were coming to pass. Women and children had begun their exodus from field work; men were working irregularly, often negligently; and thousands of ex-slaves

##### were taking up residence on vacant backlands. Angry complaints from missionaries that Jamaican planters had created their own problems, forcing freedmen to vacate estate villages by their unreasonable demands over rents and wages, seemed almost irrelevant. In Trinidad and British Guiana, other colonies with extensive back-lands, the flight from estate villages was occurring at about the same pace despite the willingness of planters to provide free housing, high wages, and numerous allowances. Sugar exports fell roughly a third in the first three years of freedom while the price of the product rose by the same margin. In 1840 Lord John Russell, the new Colonial Secretary, calculated that per capita consumption of sugar in the United Kingdom was 25 per cent below what it had been in the final years of slavery.[8]
 During the next three years, the imperial government reversed its policy on African immigration. Its first steps were taken hesitantly, but by 1843 the government in London, aware that its policy would evoke ridicule in foreign capitals, was firmly advocating the transatlantic transport of free labour from Sierra Leone to the West Indies. This change of policy led directly and inexorably to the initiation of government sponsored labour migration from India to the British Caribbean in 1845. In effect, the patterns of and the justification for indentured labour migration to the free British West Indies were largely determined in the early 1840s.
 What occasioned this change of policy? For James Stephen - and for him alone at the Colonial Office - the change represented the victory of expediency over morality. Even in the earliest days of Apprenticeship Stephen had questioned the wisdom of depositing liberated Africans recently seized by British cruisers in the sugar colonies; such people, ‘immersed in the ignorance, superstition, and moral debasement, which distinguishes the African Tribes’, could only lower the common denominator of colonial society, he argued.[9] Stephen categorically denied the economic merits of immigration, insisting that it would increase the demand for labour as much as it added to its supply.[10] He had little doubt that African labour migration to the West Indies would be carefully regulated by imperial authorities, but he worried deeply over the impact which Britain’s change of policy would have upon her moral ascendancy in Africa and the Atlantic.[11] Among officials at Downing Street, Stephen was the least concerned whether the sugar islands remained staple exporting plantation communities. While he may have preferred this, his marginal

##### notations on official correspondence gave indication that he anticipated with no great disquietude, the eventual transformation of the Caribbean colonies into peasant societies.[12]
 Stephen’s role in the formation of colonial policy diminished after 1839. Administration of the Colonial Office was by no means a political plum in early Victorian England, but beginning with Lord John Russell’s appointment in 1839, the department experienced a succession of high- powered secretaries of state, three of whom would become prime ministers of England - Russell, Stanley, and Gladstone - and a fourth. Earl Grey, who was unexcelled in his sense of purpose, administrative efficiency, and command of colonial affairs. Russell was probably the major force in Melbourne’s cabinet. He was consistently preoccupied with foreign crises and diverse matters of state bearing no important relationship to colonial affairs. Though he was responsive to Stephen’s advice, he exercised a confident independence in dealing with critical policy matters. Lord Stanley was not in sympathy with Stephen’s brand of moralism. He remained frigidly aloof from the permanent undersecretary, exploiting his talents while commonly rejecting his counsel. Gladstone, whose father was a long- time investor in Guiana estates and an early proponent of East Indian immigration to the Caribbean, administered the department only briefly. His successor. Earl Grey, was swept into office at the high tide of the free trade movement.
 Russell and Stanley as well as leading abolitionists took a more universal view of British emancipation than Stephen. When in 1833 Lord Stanley, then serving as Grey’s Colonial Secretary, introduced the Emancipation Bill in Commons, he referred to the abolition of slavery as a ‘mighty experiment’; but could the sugar colonies sustain a high level of economic productivity and a decent standard of civil government under a system of free labour? Abolitionists believed they could. They regarded British emancipation as the first step in a universal crusade against negro slavery and the African slave trade. For Buxton and his colleagues, it was an article of faith that slavery in the Americas would be most effectively undermined by rendering the British West Indies a showpiece of civil order and economic prosperity.
 Abolitionists despised slavery because it was evil, because it contravened human decency as well as the fundamental principles of the Christian religion. On these grounds alone slavery deserved extinction. But,


-----

##### appreciating that arguments from high moral principle made little impact on the hardened souls of America’s slave-owners, abolitionists appealed to their basic economic interests. Free labour, they contended, would prove cheaper and more efficient than slave labour.[13] If planters would but relieve the slaves of their degradation, offer them wages and incentives, ex-slaves, in turn, would reward their employers with a markedly superior level of productivity. The British Caribbean afforded a testing ground for this argument. Since Haiti provided the only other example of mass emancipation in the Americas, Britain’s abolitionists were intensely aware that their credibility in the world forum depended on the successful progress of the West Indian experiment.
 To guarantee success, abolitionists had to ensure the protection of emancipists’ liberties while concurrently encouraging them to produce tropical staples. In the world at large, the economic consequences of emancipation were certain to be assessed in terms of the health of the plantations and the output of sugar. Any substantial diversion of labour into the production of minor crops and provisions, household products, or other locally consumed goods and services could only reduce the level of sugar exports and thereby cast doubt upon the economic success of the experiment. When Apprenticeship ended, abolitionists and their missionary allies continued to defend the ex-slaves’ rights with vigour: they counseled and consoled them, organised and defended them. Their intercession was calculated to ensure their social well-being;it was not intended to discourage them from performing estate labour -though to some extent it had this effect. If abolitionists upbraided planters for unduly oppressing the labouring people, they also upbraided labourers for failing to work diligently and steadily on the sugar estates. John Gurney informed a body of workers in Jamaica that the eyes of the world were upon them, that they must show slave-holders that free labour could produce higher profits than slave labour.[14] Another itinerant abolitionist chastised a Guiana audience: ‘You strengthen the fetters of the slave in other lands, by giving colour to the charge, that if not compelled by force to labour as he is, he would be as idle as you are.’[15] These may have been legitimate observations, but freedmen who possessed a range of economic options were not likely to perpetuate the work routines of slavery in order to enhance the prospects of foreign bondsmen and women.


-----

##### Abolitionists laboured under a self-imposed dilemma. Their calling obliged them to defend the liberties of freedmen and women even when that defense occasioned a decline in the rate of sugar production. At the same time, they could not accept, and certainly not admit, that human freedom was inconsistent with the successful production of tropical staples. Where sugar exports fell, abolitionists blamed the planters, insisting that they failed to modernise archaic agricultural techniques and unduly alienated free workers by imperious behaviour. The sacred principle that responsibly managed free labour was superior to slave labour was never called in doubt, and abolitionist propaganda increasingly bore the imprint of self deception and duplicity. In addressing foreign audiences British abolitionists glossed over colonial problems in order to present West Indian developments in the most favourable light.[16] The transition to freedom had been peaceful, they argued, and the liberated people had hastened to embrace Christian worship, marriage, and education. When the initial period of adjustment was past, export figures would surely rise. This view was confidently and repeatedly stated at the international anti-slavery convention in London during 1840. One incautious speaker assured the delegates that under

 improved economy and management, the extended cultivation of sugar in the rich soils of Demerara and other colonies by free labour, would speedily enable British merchants to undersell the sugar planters of Brazil and Cuba, so as to drive all slave-grown sugar out of the markets of the world.[17]

 Such sentiments may have impressed anti-slavery delegates but they nevertheless had small effect at Downing Street. There, it was apparent that the West Indian experiment was floundering. Pressure was mounting from colonial governors, legislatures, and the metropolitan West India interest to relieve the burdens of the planters, to soften controls over colonial labour legislation, and to widen the scope for immigration. Without relief, it was argued, plantations would fail; local revenues would fall; roads, bridges, and public facilities would decay; hundreds of white colonists would flee the islands, taking their capital and leaving those communities socially desolate and incapable of sustaining the institutional structures of progressive civilised communities. Those most victimised by such an eventuality, the West Indians claimed, would be the freed population who

##### had only recently gained access to many of the amenities of civilised society.
 If these arguments were not in themselves convincing, the government had to contend with two significant political realities favouring moderation in its approach toward the West India planters. First, Melbourne’s government had suffered a major setback in parliament in May 1839 when it attempted to suspend the constitution of Jamaica at the height of a quarrel between the colonial assembly and the imperial government over the latter’s intrusion into the traditional legislative prerogatives of the colony. The Jamaica Assembly insisted upon retaining legislative autonomy in internal affairs; the imperial government, suspicious of the motives of the planters in their relations with ex-slaves, was determined to establish authoritarian Crown colony government in the island. When the government’s Jamaica Bill passed the House of Commons by only five votes - a margin too narrow to consider implementing the measure - Melbourne resigned. He shortly returned to office, but he was obliged to alter his approach to the colony, to undertake conciliation of the planters on grounds that he could not hope to dictate developments there. Sir Charles Metcalfe, a retired former Provisional Governor General of India who enjoyed great personal prestige, was invited to assume the governorship of Jamaica. Metcalfe conciliated the planter oligarchy with ease and success: he identified strongly with the planters’ position; he believed them unduly maligned; and he urged, in the interests of colonial prosperity, both the relaxation of labour laws and the expansion of immigration.[18]
 A second political factor influencing West India policy in 1840 was growing British interest in tariff reform. In June 1839, William Ewart proposed reducing the sugar duties as a means of relieving the great hardship suffered by working people in England. A year later the issue was raised in parliament a second time, and in early 1841 the government announced its intention to drop the tariff on foreign slave grown sugar from 63s. to 36s., setting the new rate only 12s. above that paid on colonial sugar. Though many of the more innocent abolitionists accepted these developments without anxiety, believing that free British West Indian sugar could compete with the slave-grown product of Cuba and Brazil, realistic spokesmen for the anti-slavery movement - including Lushington and O’Connell - joined the West India interest in denouncing the plan.[19]
 Melbourne’s government was defeated on the sugar issue in May, but the


-----

##### gathering momentum on tariff reform was unmistakable. The Colonial Office appreciated all too well what the abolitionist press was reluctant to admit, that under existing conditions in the British West Indies the free labour economy could not withstand competition from slave labour plantations .
 In these circumstances, Russell chose to permit voluntary emigration from Sierra Leone to the British West Indies. Stephen argued vehemently against it.[20] Russell admitted that Spain and Portugal might use the British precedent as a means of widening the slave trade, but he concluded: ‘We must rely mainly on our honesty, and their dishonesty to get us thru’ this difficulty ...’ He continued, giving lip-service to abolitionist claims for the superiority of free labour, that the colonies might ‘derive some advantage from the difference alleged between the present Slaves of Cuba, and the new Emigrants, to strike slavery at its foundation.’[21] By mid-1841 agents from Jamaica, Trinidad, and British Guiana were actively engaged in recruiting emigrants in Freetown.[22] The British Passengers Act was in force at Sierra Leone ensuring ample space, water, food and medicine as well as vaccination for emigrants. Colonial law required prospective migrants to post notice ten days in advance of leaving the colony and to pay 2s.6d. for a passport - both impediments to departure. Moreover, the imperial government required a sexual ratio of not less than one female for every two males embarking in an emigrant vessel. Contracts for labour could not be made until the emigrants arrived in the Caribbean, and then only for a single year.
 Initially, the response of Sierra Leoneans was enthusiastic. Jamaica’s Commissioner of Immigration was able to accommodate only half of those who applied to leave on the first emigrant ship.[23] By year’s end, however, emigrant vessels were departing well below capacity.[24] Trinidad had failed to send delegates back to Sierra Leone from the first wave of departures; Jamaica’s delegates were delayed when a transport ship foundered at sea. Rumour quickly spread that emigration meant sailing into slavery, and employers in West Africa exploited those fears in hope of retaining their inordinantly cheap supplies of labour. Missionaries in Sierra Leone were entirely unsympathetic to emigration: they feared the loss of converts whom they expected to employ as agents in the christianisation and civilisation of neighbouring regions of Africa.[25] The first emigrant vessel of 1841 carried

##### 265 people to Jamaica, the last a mere thirteen.[26] For the whole year only 526 Africans arrived in the colony, and in 1842 that number fell to 510. By every measure the volume of immigration was disappointing, though some planters in the rich eastern district of Jamaica commended the Africans’ work and claimed that without them they might not have gotten in the 1842 crop.[27]
 Ironically, public support in Britain for African emigration to the sugar colonies increased at a rate obversely proportional to the declining interest in emigration among West Africans. During the years 1841 and 1842, four separate developments -a commission of inquiry into the British West African settlements, a parliamentary select committee on the West India colonies, another on the West Coast of Africa, plus the ill-fated Niger expedition - directly or indirectly generated heightened support for a programme of labour migration between Africa and the West Indies.
 R.R. Madden, an abolitionist who had served as stipendiary magistrate in Jamaica and as Commissioner for Liberated Africans at Havana, was despatched to West Africa in 1841 to inquire into the state of British settlements. Madden was highly critical of the languid economy, depressing social conditions, and public corruption he discovered at Sierra Leone, and he charged local inhabitants with assisting slave traders and participating themselves in thinly veiled forms of slavery.[28] He found the land infertile, agriculture primitive, and labour redundant. Though a long-time antagonist of the West India planters. Madden expressed no doubt that liberated Africans already settled in Sierra Leone as well as those who might be liberated at Freetown in the future would benefit socially, spiritually, and materially by emigration to the British West Indies. There, freedom was assured; the civil infrastructure of a European community existed; Christian missionaries abounded; and wage rates, not to mention allowances, were four to six times those at Sierra Leone.
 The formation of Peel’s second ministry in 1841[29] and the seating of a select committee on the Caribbean colonies gave new hope to the planters. The West India interest carefully orchestrated the presentation of its cause to the committee, complaining of irregular and ineffective labour, unduly high wage bills, and the inability of colonial governments to prevent freedpersons from squatting on vacant lands. They explained the system of sugar production, particularly the extent to which heavy capital investment in mill and factory equipment required the main-tenence of large


-----

##### agricultural establishments to gain full advantage of economies of scale. In relations between employers and workers, they observed, bargaining advantage had passed to the workers: it was not, as in England, a favour to bestow employment but one to offer labour. Any effort to reduce wages by combinations among employers would fail, as indeed it had already failed in British Guiana, by evoking a more powerful and less vulnerable combination among workers. Only immigration, they argued, could rectify the balance between labour and capital preventing the ruination of the estates and the regression of freedpersons into a state of isolation and barbarism. In contrast to this, abolitionist witnesses chided the planters for offering workers too few inducements. William Knibb, a Baptist missionary in Jamaica of 18 years, repeated Stephen’s warning that the introduction of thousands of ‘barbarous’ Africans would only increase crime and reduce social morality in the colonies.[30] On balance, however, the weight of evidence convinced committeemen that although freedpersons had enjoyed a remarkable improvement in the quality of life - in morality as well as material prosperity - since the end of Apprenticeship, their plenty had been won at the expense of the plantations and at the long-term social and economic peril of the colonies. The committee recommended that immigration be expanded and that it be conducted under supervision of the imperial government.[31]
 The Select Committee on the West Coast of Africa firmly endorsed this recommendation on grounds that there was a sufficient population in Sierra Leone capable of emigrating and that their migration to the West Indies would benefit them as well as the Empire.[32] The Treasury had held this view for some time. Treasury officials were anxious to cut expenses at Sierra Leone where annual maintenance of liberated Africans was costing about fourteen thousand pounds. If Africans could be transferred to the Caribbean upon their liberation at Sierra Leone, this cost could be eliminated. Moreover, since the West India colonies were more advanced than Sierra Leone, offering more schools, higher wages, good land and luxuries, the Africans would be much better placed. In the impoverished colony around Freetown, liberated Africans were consistently inundated by ‘fresh barbarians from the condemned slave ships’ whereas in the West Indies, where population was vastly greater, liberated Africans could be assimilated without seriously endangering the social fabric. Finally, as one Treasury official argued, ‘Every new advantage obtained by the Countries

##### in which tropical productions are raised by free labour, is a new discouragement to slavery and hastens the period at which slavery will be finally abolished.’[33] In effect, he continued, the movement of labour to the British West Indies from Sierra Leone would constitute a service not only to liberated Africans and West India colonists, but to British taxpayers and to all freedom loving people everywhere.
 In more subdued tones, a similar message was presented in a famous series of lectures delivered at Oxford between 1839 and 1841 by Herman Merivale, Stephen’s future successor as permanent undersecretary. Merivale called for ‘copious immigration’ to the larger West India colonies. If immigration did not bring down the price of labour before tariff reform introduced cheap slave-grown sugar to the British market, the whole social structure of the Caribbean colonies would collapse. No subject had greater claim to public attention, he thought: to allow the major British Caribbean colonies to sink into a Haitian-like obscurity would be a shock to the interests of humanity ’ which it may take centuries to repair’.[34]
 A final inducement to the revision of government immigration policy came from an unexpected source. In 1841 the much heralded Niger expedition steamed into African waters bearing the humanitarian hopes of Sir Fowell Buxton and a large element of the anti-slavery movement. Like others, Buxton viewed the end of slavery in the West Indies as the first step in a long road toward universal abolition. After losing his parliamentary seat in 1837, he devoted the whole of his energy to studying the Atlantic slave trade and devising a strategy to combat it. The results of this endeavour were published in two volumes. The African Slave Trade (1839) and The Remedy (1840). In the spring of 1839 Buxton established a large and impressive pressure group, the African Civilisation Society, to advance the objects of his philanthropy. The organisation, presided over by Prince Albert, acquired among its honorary membership four archbishops, eighteen bishops, five dukes, eight marquises, and fifteen earls. The executive committee which Buxton chaired comprised thirteen peers and twenty members of parliament.[35] It was amply apparent to the vulnerable Melbourne government that it could ill afford to ignore Buxton’s proposals.[36]
 Since 1819 a British squadron had been patrolling West African waters capturing foreign vessels engaged in slave trading in violation of international accords. Buxton believed this effort, however commendable,


-----

##### had failed and that the slave trade had become larger and more destructive than ever. While calling for an increase in the size of the squadron, he also advocated the dispatch of British agents to the African coast to obtain formal treaties with native chiefs renouncing the slave trade in favour of legitimate commerce. New trading posts were projected as a means of facilitating this commerce, and model farms were to be cleared and planted to show Africans how to generate legitimate trade goods..[37] Buxton’s pilot project was planned for the Niger River region, and in August 1841, 158 men in three specially built vessels slipped through the mangrove swamps of the Niger delta in an effort to solicit treaties, inaugurate trade, and plant a model farm at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers.
 The expedition was a disaster. Malaria swept the crews, killing a third of the men and disabling most of the rest.[38] The model farm did little more than abuse the hospitality of neighbouring tribes-people, and the project was abruptly terminated in 1842. Its failure emphasised several points. Europeans could not hope to make Africa a field for their own humanitarian crusades. The Atlantic slave trade would only be ended when slavery was abolished in the American states; therefore, encouragement should be given to the struggling free labour plantation colonies. If, at the same time, Europeans wished to pursue Buxton’s goal of civilising and christianising Africa, they would have to employ African agents who were inured to the disease environment - a so-called ‘black agency’.
 The most outspoken critic of Buxton’s Niger strategy had been Macgregor Laird, an enterprising, public-spirited figure who had led a commercial venture into the river in 1832. Having warned the nation against the project,[39] Laird advised the 1842 West African Select Committee how the government might, by alternative means, pursue Buxton’s objectives. If the civilisation of Africa required a black agency, those agents could best be procured in the West India colonies where people of African descent came into intimate contact with European civilisation. The best means of promoting those contacts was to encourage free government-sponsored migration between West Africa and the West Indies. Laird chastised abolitionists who opposed emigration from Sierra Leone to the British Caribbean - ‘as well might they object to our removing the starving weavers in Paisley to Canada or Australia.’[40] Believing that a fulsome supply of labour would enable the Caribbean colonies to quadruple their exports. Laird concluded that by the profitable employment of African


-----

##### labour in the sugar colonies Britain would achieve two goals at a single stroke. It would enhance the ability of the free labour colonies to compete with slave labour regimes, and it would create thousands of agents who, upon their return to Africa, would impart aspects of European civilisation to their fellow countrymen and women.
 By 1842, public sentiment had shifted. Transatlantic transport of free African labour, considered anathema four years earlier, seemed to offer the only means of fulfilling the multiple material and moral objectives of the nation. This change of outlook had its expedient qualities; indeed, it is suspected that the Treasury possessed greater mercenary than moral interest in African emigration. But by 1842 the material interest of the West India planters as well as the compelling sense of thrift among Treasury officials had merged with the moral posture of Britons who believed that the great experiment was at risk and that the overall best interests of West India freedmen. Sierra Leoneans, and other Africans would be served by a strong national commitment to immigration as a means of bolstering the free labour plantations. In 1843, the imperial government, responding to recommendations of the two select committees, assumed responsibility for the recruitment and transport of African emigrants from Sierra Leone to Jamaica, Trinidad, and British Guiana.[41]
 The project proved a bitter disappointment. Although the Colonial Secretary removed all reasonable impediments to emigration from Freetown, dropping the requirement that a third of each vessel’s complement be women while concurrently offering emigrants a £3 incentive payment, Africans refused to leave the colony. Stanley chastised the governor at Freetown for insufficient support of his policy, and he reduced funding for the Liberated African Department hoping to force newly arrived recaptives to accept emigration.[42] Nothing succeeded. After eighteen transatlantic passages by three government transport vessels, only 1, 373 adults and 814 children had departed Sierra Leone, 612 of them to Jamaica.[43] In its last six months of service, Jamaica’s immigrant ship, capable of accommodating 221 adults, carried a mere 24 adults and eighteen children.[44] By mid-1845, the imperial government had little choice but to withdraw its transport vessels, permitting a return to the original plan whereby colonial bounties would be paid on African emigrants conveyed to the Caribbean by private parties.


-----

##### The disappointment sustained in West Africa impelled imperial authorities to initiate labour migration from India to the West Indies. About 25, 000 Indians had migrated to Mauritius between 1834 and 1839, but that process had given rise to terrible abuses causing the Indian government to impose prohibition.[45] The ban was lifted at the end of 1842 with the establishment of a new system of controls, and in the following year 34, 525 Indians were landed at Mauritius.[46] India appeared to offer boundless resources of cheap unskilled labour, and Stanley, frustrated by inactivity at Sierra Leone and goaded by members of the metropolitan West India interest, approached the Government of India at the end of 1843 proposing the establishment of labour migration between India and the major West India colonies. The Indian government gave its approval in mid-1844, whereupon Stanley notified Jamaica, Trinidad, and British Guiana that the imperial government would administer a programme of Asian labour migration provided they took appropriate action to defer the cost and assure the protection of the new immigrants.
 The response was enthusiastic in Trinidad and British Guiana, positive but cautious in Jamaica. Stanley authorised 2, 500 Asians for Trinidad in the first year, 5, 000 for each of the larger colonies. Though the large eastern Caribbean Crown colonies readily accepted these figures, the Jamaica Assembly, in October 1844, declared its preference for only 2, 000 Indians.[47] Jamaica was in the throes of a paralysing drought, the fourth in six years, and planters feared that among its multiple difficulties the island was experiencing a permanent change of climate.[48] Many of them had come to their rope’s end. Although there was considerable pressure on declining colonial revenues, the Assembly nevertheless voted £50, 000 to cover the cost of 2, 000 Asian immigrants while concurrently it made plans for assessing each employer of Indians only 20s. in tax per immigrant.[49] In effect, the burden of Jamaica’s immigration was calculated to fall upon general revenues, more than half of which were derived from import duties that weighed largely on the labouring class. This practice was justified on grounds that all parties in Jamaica would gain from the prosperity of the sugar estates and that whatever inducement Asian workers offered freedpersons to pursue regular labour on the plantations would, in the long run, serve to enhance the latter’s moral development, personal discipline, and social progress.


-----

##### In Jamaica, as elsewhere, a strict regulatory system was adopted to protect Indian immigrants. In exchange for nine hours of work daily, they were to be paid Is. and afforded adequate housing, garden space, medicine, and medical attention; they were to be distributed in large groups for their own social and emotional security - groups of twenty-five were considered minimal - and estates applying for their services were required to undergo inspection to ascertain that dwelling places and general provisions were satisfactory.[50] Planters employing Indian servants were compelled to post bond as security that they would fulfill their commitments to the immigrants.[51] Conditions on the oceanic passage from Calcutta and Madras, the two collection points, had to conform with terms of the Passengers Act. Before boarding, Indian migrants were subject to physical examination; they were granted a small stipend and promised a return voyage at colonial expense after five years. Sailings were scheduled to depart India to catch the favourable monsoon and avoid rounding the Cape in winter. In terms of formal regulations, the governments of India, the United Kingdom, and Jamaica exercised conscientious care. The first Indians to arrive in Jamaica were distributed through Clarendon and Vere, sugar parishes adjacent to the seat of government where the Agent-General of Immigration was able to undertake close and frequent inspection.[52]
 Initially, the programme was well received. But within two years Jamaica’s planters turned moderately sour on Indian labour, and their ability to sustain the programme evaporated with the passage of the Sugar Duties Act. Between 1845 and 1847, 4, 551 Indians were introduced to Jamaica. Encouraged to accept contracts of one year’s duration, they were distributed in groups of 25 to 80 among applicant sugar estates.[53] Planters who received the services of Indians arriving on the lone immigrant ship of 1845 reported to the House of Assembly that the immigrants were working well and appeared generally industrious.[54] That was all the Assembly needed. Abundant rains had returned that year; anxieties of the previous year were diminished; and Assemblymen declared the island ready to accept 5, 000 Asians in 1846.[55]
 Longer experience with Indian labour tempered the Jamaicans’ enthusiasm. By 1847, the Indians were considered, at best, a mixed blessing. They performed work which would otherwise not have been accomplished, and they were deemed more efficient and thorough than


-----

##### creoles in the lighter tasks of weeding and trashing. But Indians were uniformly perceived as vastly inferior in physical strength to creoles and Africans, being altogether incapable of performing the most demanding tasks of sugar cultivation. Some Indians had no experience with agricultural labour in their homelands, having been handicraft workers, barbers, washermen, or domestic servants if, indeed, they had maintained any steady employment at all. Their religious views rendered them ineffective as drivers of estate cattle, and their poor health occasioned an irritating amount of absenteeism. One planter after another bewailed their filthy personal habits and sickliness, complaining most often of their susceptibility to cutaneous ulcers and infestations of chigoes. Indians refused to cover their feet, and they resisted the attentions of negroes who were skilled at extracting burrowing insects from human flesh. Planters in all receiving colonies distinguished emphatically between Calcutta and Madras people,[56]
 the latter being universally condemned for their idleness, unreliability, and compelling will to adopt vagrant habits which could only be sustained by beggary. Indians refused to mix socially with native workers, and by virtue of the great disparity in numbers between male and female immigrants, women were often held commonly by many men. After enduring a single year under contract, most indentured workers refused to engage in further contracts. Those who did often broke secondary contracts, left their estates, and sought a poor subsistence through odd jobs and mendicancy. In Jamaica as in Trinidad, they became a blight upon the towns. Their labour had not been bought cheaply.
 While under contract, they absorbed rations and medicines whether they were fit for work or not.[57]
 Despite the liabilities of Asian labour, Jamaica might well have continued its immigration programme had the planters not been devastated by the combined impact of the Sugar Duties Act, renewed drought, and an international depression. The first of these, following immediately the abolition of the Corn Laws, marked the beginning of Britain’s imperial transition to free trade. It established a declining annual differential between colonial and foreign sugar duties until, by 1851, the duty on all sugar, foreign and colonial, slave-grown or free-grown, was to be equalised in British markets. The sugar bill provoked tumultuous debates in parliament with the curious spectacle of West Indians and abolitionists fighting hand in hand to combat a measure which both now conceded would stimulate the

##### slave trade and imperil the future of free labour sugar production.[58] Old arguments that free labour could outproduce slave labour had not died, but their currency was debased; appeals by the abolitionist-West Indian alliance that the colonies needed more time to set the great experiment on solid footing proved of no avail. Britain’s growing industrial society needed cheap food and raw materials. Subsidised industries in the colonies, free traders argued, would only perpetuate inefficiencies that might be eliminated by the shock of open competition.
 No amount of dogmatism, no economic platitudes could dissuade Jamaican planters from the belief that free trade spelled doom. The drought of 1846 was in its final disabling stages when news of the Sugar Duties Act arrived. Some estates in the south of the island made no crop that year; eight months without rain had left streams and wells parched dry. Repeated droughts since 1838 had devastated herds and limited the planters’ ability to test new techniques, new fertilisers, and new equipment. When, in 1847, foreign sugar imports rose by 38 percent in Britain, the Gazette price on sugar fell from 37s. a hundred-weight to 22s.6d., well below the cost of bringing the product to market for most Jamaicans.[59] The catastrophic drop in prices in a period of deep economic depression bankrupted many West Indian merchant houses upon whom the planters relied for credit. The Planters Bank of Jamaica folded in 1848. Money was difficult to obtain, and many planters were unable to pay taxes or wages.
 Before the Sugar Duties Act, Jamaica’s Agent-General for Immigration had received applications from planters for the services of 8, 000 Indians.[60]
 The colony had requested that 5, 000 Indians be despatched to Jamaica in the 1846-47 season. When tariff changes were announced, applications for Indians fell to 1, 200, and the Government of Jamaica reduced its request for Asians from 5, 000 to 1, 500.[61] In November 1846, the House of Assembly renounced further Asian immigration. A year later, the new governor. Sir Charles Grey, stated his belief that Jamaica would never resume high cost immigration from India.[62]
 Jamaica was not out of step. In fact, from the Emancipation Act to 1846, Jamaica’s immigration policy paralleled that of Trinidad and British Guiana. All three had pursued immigration from North America, from the mixed commission courts at Havana and Rio, and from Sierra Leone. Jamaica had attempted North European immigration; British Guiana had

##### undertaken Portugese immigration from Madeira. All three colonies experienced a mixed response to Indian labour; all three cancelled the Asian immigration programme in the wake of free trade. Planters in the major colonies believed themselves incapable of direct competition with the slave states, and they utilised every resource at their disposal to achieve a restoration of differential duties. Perceiving that the loss of protection would occasion major losses in colonial revenue, the Jamaica Assembly demanded a retrenchment of public expenditure; the Combined Court in British Guiana, a Crown colony possessing the unique constitutional prerogative of controlling its own purse, did likewise. Both legislatures made heavy cuts in government salaries, some of which were inordinantly high in view of the reduced circumstances of the Caribbean colonies. The Colonial Office regarded salary cuts a violation of honorable pledges, and refused to countenance sweeping retrenchment. A constitutional crisis ensued. The Combined Court of British Guiana withheld supplies; the Jamaica Assembly voted to maintain only the most essential government services while forbidding the payment of salaries to public officials or Anglican clergymen.[63]
 At home, the West India interest and its parliamentary allies gained the appointment of a select committee on sugar and coffee planting chaired by Lord George Bentinck, an aggressive imperialist of the old school and an ardent protectionist. The committee’s membership was split seven to six between protectionists and free traders, but its final report acknowledged that the Sugar Duties Act had ‘precipitated the ruin’ of the colonies, forcing the extensive abandonment of estates. It declared the colonies in need of relief. Political division made it impossible for the committee to recommend the permanent restoration of protection, but its final report did advocate a delay in the onset of equalisation.[64]
 The Russell government made modest efforts to conciliate the planters. Russell and Earl Grey, the Colonial Secretary, hoped to preserve plantation agriculture in the Caribbean colonies: indeed. Grey expressed British policy explicitly in a letter to the Governor of Trinidad: ‘I consider the highest interest of the negroes to require that the cultivation of Sugar should not be abandoned, and that the proprietors of European race should be enabled to maintain their place in the society of the Colony...’[65] This position did not, of course, assume precedence over the government’s primary commitment to free trade. If the need arose, the government was prepared to sacrifice the


-----

##### sugar colonies in the interest of free trade. But such sacrifices did not seem necessary. The first requirement of the planters was for cheap, reliable labour, and Earl Grey, with naive self assurance, set out to provide it.
 In late 1846, the Colonial Secretary initiated action with the Admiralty to secure a steamship that could ply between West Africa and the Caribbean six times a year. He extended labour recruitment to the Kroo coast, an area outside British jurisdiction inhabited by people with whom the British had constant contact and who, by reputation, did not maintain slaves.[66] When it became apparent that the Sugar Duties Act had stimulated the Atlantic slave trade and led to numerous captures by British cruisers. Grey arranged for the despatch of ten sailing ships to Freetown to convey a growing population of recaptives to the West Indies.[67] The British government provided guarantees to shipowners, and Grey instructed the Governor of Sierra Leone that his future in Her Majesty’s service would depend upon his success in encouraging a bounteous transatlantic labour migration.[68] At St Helena, the main depot for recaptives in the South Atlantic, permanent settlement of Africans was impossible, and after 1846 all recaptives were despatched, in turn, to Britain’s three largest sugar colonies.
 The rising flow of recaptives increased African immigration for a brief period without putting it on a firm foundation. Recruitment on the Kroo coast was unrewarding, and the steamship assigned to emigrant duty proved too slow and too expensive for the service. Because the crisis-ridden sugar colonies were incapable of meeting even the most modest immigration expenses, Britain assumed the full cost of transatlantic labour movements in 1848. But African emigration continued to depend on the erratic success of naval seizures. No manner of threats directed to the Governor of Sierra Leone could generate interest in emigration among the established population around Freetown. Moreover, in 1851, Foreign Office pressure and naval action finally brought an end to the Brazilian slave trade causing an immediate drop in the number of recaptives available for indenture. Thereafter, West Africa ceased to figure as a prospective source of immigrant labour.
 If African policy offered small comfort for the planters, developments in Britain were entirely discouraging. Responding to the final report from the Committee on Sugar and Coffee Planting, Russell temporarily widened the differential between British and foreign sugar and postponed the final equalisation of duties from 1851 to 1854.[69] This meagre concession was


-----

##### sweetened by the government’s offer of a guaranteed low interest loan of £500, 000 to be available to Jamaica, Trinidad, and British Guiana for the purposes of immigration. The government’s policy was clear. It would not be deterred from free trade, but it would compensate the planters, to the extent possible, by advocating and supporting immigration. Of course, immigration on the scale proposed could only come from India.
 Russell’s offer was unacceptable. Both Jamaica and British Guiana continued to withhold supplies until late 1849 hoping vainly to force a return of protection or, at least, a return of the Tories. Disarray among Tories, the intractable stance of the imperial government, and the appeal of the guaranteed loan finally brought the Guiana planters to heel. The Jamaica Assembly relented for other reasons. Unlike Trinidad and British Guiana, Jamaica did not take up the guaranteed loan, nor did it renew a large and steady immigration of indentured workers from the East Indies. In fact, in 1849, Jamaica’s policy veered away from that of the other large sugar colonies. Though the large Crown colonies launched sustained programmes of Indian immigration and gradually recovered their economic equilibrium as plantation economies, Jamaica experienced only a brief burst of Indian immigration, 1860 to 1863, before its career as a legislative colony ended in the crisis of Morant Bay. During the critical mid-century years, its sugar economy continued to deteriorate.
 The explanation for Jamaica’s separate experience involves politics and demography as well as economics. Jamaica was an old colony. Trinidad and British Guiana were relatively new, comparatively undeveloped, and blessed, for the most part, with land that had been under intense cultivation a shorter time. The greater fertility of those colonies permitted the ratooning of sugar cane up to twenty years, offering important savings in labour not possible in the older soils of Jamaica.[70] At the same time, the large Crown colonies had always suffered greater scarcity of labour than Jamaica, even in the age of slavery. In Trinidad, cane was commonly planted amidst rotting tree stumps because there was insufficient labour to clear the land thoroughly. When slavery ended, British slaveholders were compensated for the loss of slave property according to the relative productivity-value of their slaves. In British Guiana, 82, 000 slaves had produced, on average, 60, 000 tons of sugar per year between 1824 and 1833. Jamaica had more than three times the number of slaves, but the island exported only 68, 500 tons a year in the same period. Because of the relative scarcity of labour in


-----

##### Trinidad and British Guiana, the average compensation paid per slave was £50 and £51 respectively. In Jamaica, average compensation was slightly below £20.[71] In the eastern Crown colonies, infusions of labour were absolutely critical if the estates were to survive. Jamaica had more abundant creole labour; the problem was one of encouraging the creoles to engage in estate service.
 Jamaica had other distinct problems. Its estates, burdened during their eighteenth century heyday with numerous mortgages, legacies, and other charges, were, by 1850, weighed down by debts nearly always exceeding their market values. Nominal owners could neither raise money on the value of such properties nor hope to sell them.[72] In the newer colonies encumbrance was not a comparable problem. Trinidad and Guiana planters and their merchant allies dominated respectively the Legislative Council and Combined Court. Although coloured populations in those colonies were growing, they were less self conscious, less educated, and far less vocal than the coloured middle class of Jamaica. Coloured Jamaicans had risen to positions of importance in the government and magistracy; they were leading printers, newspapermen, teachers, and clergymen; and they held a substantial number of seats in the House of Assembly. Though still a minority, the coloured party could, on specific measures, gain support from a full half-dozen Jewish members, the descendants of trading families who were prone to resent the high-handedness and Anglicanism of the leading planters.[73] In the large Crown colonies, planters had no powerful political opposition. They could, at will, advocate a line of policy dedicated to serving the estates even at the long-term social or financial risk of the colonies. If such ventures failed, the European elite could retire from the sugar colonies and rebuild their lives in Britain or Canada. This was not the case in Jamaica. There, social roots were deeper, and important political groups had a permanent stake in the colony. All Jamaica’s political factions were prepared to run risks in the hope of preserving a staple export economy, and in 1848 coloured assemblymen exhibited tight solidarity with the planters in their retrenchment battle. But the stoppage of supplies in Jamaica especially victimised lower and middle ranking officials whose salaries were withheld. In the main, such persons were men of colour. Though willing to stand for protection, they could ill afford to stand forever, and by mid-1849 their discontentment was being expressed in election results that weakened the planter party in the Assembly.


-----

##### When the guaranteed government loan for immigration was offered to Jamaica, assemblymen were already bedeviled by the enormous problem of repaying a £750, 000 debt, nearly half of which had been incurred since 1843.[74] Recent immigration had already weakened a fragile fiscal structure. Further immigration, particularly of Indians, would aggravate social problems without providing assurance that the colony’s burdened estates could compete with those of Cuba, Brazil, or even Barbados.[75] All witnesses before Bentinck’s select committee expressed unqualified gloom concerning the prospects of sugar cultivation in the island. Alexander Geddes, a respected planter with nearly thirty years experience in the colony, argued that declining island revenue jeopardised the maintenance of churches, schools, hospitals, asylums, even the jails and police; it rendered the acquisition of large groups of immigrants at colonial expense impossible.[76] Lord Howard de Walden, one-time ambassador to Spain and absentee owner of some of Jamaica’s finest sugar property, believed that only through a prodigious increase of population and the most rigorous public economies could Jamaica’s planters hope to compete in a free market with Cuban producers.[77] Under no circumstances short of protection, he added, could they survive the competition of Brazil. In Jamaica, no one believed the sugar economy could continue with profit unless protection was restored. Increasingly, coloured and Jewish assemblymen expressed hope that minor staples, like coffee, ginger and pimento which they commonly traded, would provide an alternative basis for rebuilding the depressed economy. Because Jamaica’s debt was higher, because her plantations were more burdened and less fertile than those of British Guiana and Trinidad, and because the island was the permanent home for a large middle class having important political power and no desire to share their patrimony with East Indians, Jamaica refused the guaranteed loan, Indian immigration, and a further heavy, perhaps futile, public commitment to the sugar industry.
 The 1850s were difficult years in Jamaica. In the decade before 1854, 49 percent of the island’s sugar estates went out of cultivation.[78] Roads, bridges, and wharves deteriorated; railroad and tramway projects, contemplated in the ‘forties, were abandoned. Peasants who had earned considerable income selling provisions to estate populations watched their markets shrink. The abandonment of estates left them physically isolated


-----

##### and increasingly impoverished. Magistrates bewailed the rise of petty crime and the decline of social morality, conditions aggravated during the early ‘fifties by epidemics of cholera, influenza, and smallpox. At Spanish Town, the planters lost control of the Assembly, and political life degenerated to incessant bickering over the meagre spoils of a wasted economy.
 Immigration aroused little debate in the colony until the arrival of Governor Henry Barkly, a West India proprietor and former Governor of British Guiana who strongly advocated a renewal of immigration.[79] Barkly had no faith in the capacity of minor staples to reverse Jamaica’s decline, and he was impressed by the positive impact which Indian immigration was having upon the staple agriculture of British Guiana and Trinidad. His first task was to reform colonial government and secure a stable programme for repaying Jamaica’s debt - these measures were successfully achieved by 1854. The Crimean War commenced in the same year, driving up sugar prices and giving new hope to planters who had been limping along from year to year. By 1857, stipendiary magistrates and politicians who had consistently expressed adamant opposition to immigration were beginning to revise their views.[80] The modest restoration of prosperity whetted everyone’s appetite for more, and the Governor, with concurrence from the legislature, initiated enquiries in London concerning the renewal of Indian immigration.
 In 1858, the colonial legislature established a new immigration law conforming, in the main, to the more stringent terms upon which Indians were being indented in the Crown colonies. Indian immigrants arriving in the West Indies in the ‘fifties were obliged to endure an indenture contract with a single employer for three consecutive years, followed by two twelve- month contracts with any employer of the immigrants’ own choosing. The free return passage to India after five years of industrial residence had been withdrawn. Instead, Asian workers were obliged to make contributions of £7.15s. toward their own return passages after ten years of industrial residence. These tighter controls had been imposed for two reasons. Planters were unwilling to suffer the weighty cost of Indian immigration unless contracts of indenture insured their continuous use of Asian workers for a substantial period of time. Secondly, the vagrant habits exhibited by Indians in the 1840s had evoked disgust and anger among colonists and had led to extraordinary suffering and to death for some immigrants.


-----

##### Despite stringent controls imposed upon immigrants, Jamaica planters did not immediately respond to the invitation to resume Indian labour immigration. The Jamaica law imposed the full cost of immigration directly upon the employer of Asian labour, and the burden of that cost discouraged applications for indentured workers. The financial terms of the law reflected the political complexion of the Assembly where the power of the planters had been severely eroded. Non-planters did not believe the whole society should be taxed to support the immigration of indentured plantation workers. The imperial government thought otherwise. In 1858 the Secretary of State advocated Indian immigration to Jamaica on grounds that a rebuilding of the sugar industry was the only way to revive the island’s prosperity.[81] Since immigrants consumed taxable articles, purchased goods from island merchants, and bought provisions from the peasantry, everyone shared the economic benefits of Asian immigration.
 Therefore, argued the Colonial Office, up to one-third of the cost of immigration should be borne by general colonial revenues. Not until 1861- 62 were changes to this effect undertaken in the law of Jamaica. It was during those years that the island’s second wave of Indian immigration reached its peak.
 The new immigration was short-lived. By New Year 1863, applications for Indian immigrants had stopped, and planters were desperately trying to escape the burden of contracts already undertaken. The annual price of sugar, having risen to 36s.lld. in 1857, plummeted to an all-time low of 21s.7d. in 1863.[82] The American Civil War had driven up the price of imports, subjecting planters to an impossible cost-price squeeze. In February 1863, Jamaica again cancelled its programme of Asian immigration, having introduced only 4, 645 Indians to the colony since 1860.[83]
 The mid-sixties were watershed years for Jamaica. Mounting poverty and social disorder set the island apart from the leading British sugar colonies. In Trinidad and British Guiana, a decade of continuous Indian immigration had envigorated the sugar economy. Public spending on civic amenities had risen; wages were comparatively high; employment was abundant; and each year hundreds of creoles migrated to Trinidad from the Windward Islands to perform remunerative heavy tasks on the sugar estates.[84] Jamaica’s sugar industry, though depressed, continued to dominate the island’s export business. Minor staples showed no prospect of displacing the main crop: if


-----

##### anything, coffee production had been harder hit than sugar; ginger sales were sharply off; pimento exports declined in the’sixties; logwood sales were growing, but their overall importance was negligible. When thousands of island people petitioned the Crown for relief in 1865, they were advised by colonial authorities to work more industriously to revitalise the sugar estates.
 This advice was not thoughtlessly given, though it had little applicability in large sections of the island and was insensitive to the wishes of Jamaica’s peasant class. Great areas of the colony formerly occupied by sugar or coffee plantations were, by 1865, planted in small farms and peasant plots of overgrown with forest and scrub. Some concentrations of sugar property persisted, but Jamaica had largely defected from the ranks of the sugar colonies. In substantial measure it had become a peasant society, and there was little chance that the island could or would revert to its former preoccupation with sugar. The Colonial Office deplored the extent of these developments because it had little hope that poor peasant communities isolated from significant world intercourse and lacking the capital to maintain an advanced economic infrastructure could avoid subsiding into a state of primitivism. Victorians were paternalists, not egalitarians; they lived in a hierarchical society, and they advocated the merits of hierarchy to their Caribbean colonists. The European elite, for all its limitations, was deemed vital to the well-being of the colonies. Without planters, there would be little need for cattle ranchers (pen keepers), large scale merchants, professional people and the skilled workmen who continued to serve the estates. In the mid-nineteenth century, Jamaica could offer no crop, no mineral, no industry other than sugar that might preserve a significant European presence. Since Britain refused to subsidise its colonial treasuries at the expense of its taxpayers, colonial authorities concluded that Jamaica’s only prospect for achieving economic viability above the level of Haitian- style peasant subsistence was sugar.
 The Queen’s advice of 1865 fell on deaf ears. Embittered peasants broke into rebellion at Morant Bay, evoking terror among Europeans and coloured colonists and inducing a frightened House of Assembly to vote its own demise. Crown colony government was installed, and in ensuing years, the Colonial Office exercised increased influence over the direction of Jamaican affairs. The result was a narrowing of policy distinctions between that island and the large Crown colonies of the Eastern Caribbean. The


-----

##### planter interest regained some of its lost influence, and East Indian immigration was renewed. From 1867 to 1914 when systematic Asian immigration to Jamaica ended, the colony introduced 27, 215 Indian workers on lengthy indentures.[85] Those workers did not expand sugar cultivation as did their counterparts in Trinidad and British Guiana. Their presence merely prevented a weakened industry from falling much below the depressed levels of the 1860s.
 In its chequered encounter with immigration, Jamaica attracted several thousand Europeans, a few North American persons. West Africans, East Indians, and a smattering of Chinese.[86] Although Africans were preferred, they refused to emigrate from Sierra Leone despite the almost uniform, albeit culturally biased, conviction of European observers that the interests of the Sierra Leone settlers would be served by migration to the Caribbean. More than half of the Africans landed in Jamaica between 1841 and 1867 were recaptives freshly liberated at St Helena. African immigration depended on naval seizures, and those seizures were concentrated in the years from 1847 to 1851 - between the passage of the Sugar Duties Act which stimulated the Atlantic trade and the abolition of the Brazilian slave trade.
 In the years immediately following slave emancipation, the Colonial Office resisted the concept of indentured labour migration, insisting that no contracts of service be formalised outside the colony. All labour contracts undertaken in Jamaica were limited to one year. The Colonial Office moderated its position in the early ‘forties with respect to European and North American migrants who were considered fully competent to guard their own best interests. After 1842, newly recaptured Africans were indented under obligatory single-year contracts on grounds that their ignorance of European customs and their primitive conditions placed them in special need. The first wave of Indian immigrants arrived without obligation to accept contracts, though they uniformly took service on approved estates for a year. After one year, Indians generally resisted recon- tracting and were prone to wander aimlessly, surviving - if they survived at all - through odd tasks and mendicancy. Despite his strong ideological objection to labour contracts of any kind. Earl Grey permitted the introduction of obligatory indenture in 1848. The acceptable length of indenture was raised to three years in the early 1850s and to five years after 1862.[87]


-----

##### The increasing rigour exhibited by the Colonial Office toward indentured labour resulted partly from a growing awareness of practical realities and partly from the need to compensate planters for the loss of protection. Once the Colonial Office accepted the proposition that the best interests of both Africa and the British sugar colonies would be served by ‘copious’ immigration, successive secretaries of state lectured, threatened, and chastised British governors at Sierra Leone in order to evoke a more generous exodus. When, in 1847, Earl Grey permitted recruiting on a section of the African coast outside British jurisdiction, he acted in a manner which, a decade earlier, would have aroused universal condemnation at Downing Street. In the economic crisis of the late ‘forties. Grey was more concerned with consoling planters who felt betrayed by the Sugar Duties Act than setting an impeccable example for other maritime nations along the coast of Africa. Having adopted free trade as its highest priority, the imperial government compromised its moral position on African and Indian immigration in hope of preserving viable plantation colonies.
 The influence of abolitionist societies waned during the mid-century, but the issues they raised continued to evoke debate. Was free labour cheaper than slave labour? Was East Indian immigration morally defensible? As late as 1857, Governor Hincks of Barbados affirmed the first point and denied the second.[88] In Barbados, where population density exceeded 500 persons per square mile, free labour had proven more efficient and productive than slave labour; likewise, in St Kitts and Antigua, where population density was also high, a similar argument could have been made. But the ratio of people to arable land was of a different order in Jamaica, Trinidad, and British Guiana. In these colonies the transition from slave to free labour had placed the sugar economy in peril of extinction. Responding to the Governor of Barbados, Herman Merivale, the permanent undersecretary, employed the logic used in his Oxford lectures nearly two decades earlier: slave labour is dearer than free only when free labour can be procured in abundance.[89] In the large sugar colonies, only immigration could reduce the ratio between land and labour. Merivale was not well disposed toward immigration, particularly Indian immigration. He considered it morally offensive, but he could see no reasonable alternative to it, saving the collapse of the staple industry with widespread social results more unacceptable than the immigration he patently disliked.[90]


-----

##### By the end of the nineteenth century, Indian immigration to Jamaica had become a matter of routine. Moral questions, though still debated, evoked much less concern. The American Civil war ended any serious anxiety about the relative efficiency of free or slave labour. After 1867, Indian immigration was continued because it achieved some practical advantage while occasioning little immediate harm. The government of India was pleased to be rid of excess population in difficult years. Though Indian migrants suffered indignities under indenture and no small emotional torment by their cultural dislocation, many of them substantially enhanced their material well-being in the West Indies. Those returning to Asia often did so with considerable savings.
 The immigration of identured workers did not forestall the massive deterioration of Jamaica’s sugar economy in the half-century after emancipation. There was no sustained or reliable flow of immigrants before the transition to Crown colony government, and thereafter the annual rate of immigration, though consistent, was comparatively small. In the final decades of the programme, the exodus of black Jamaicans to Panama for work on the canal greatly exceeded the influx of Asian workers. Between 1881 and 1911, 43, 000 Jamaicans emigrated to Panama, 26, 000 others to the United States, Cuba, Costa Rica and other areas of Central America.[91]
 Curiously, they left an island suffering labour shortages in the sugar industry in order to secure other employment. That they had not been disposed to work on the sugar estates, even for somewhat lower wages, suggests that the problem of free wage labour in Jamaica was less a function of the inveterate indolence of black workers than their specific objection to plantation service. Indians helped keep estates afloat, though fully one-third of them returned to Asia at the expiration of their industrial residence. The whole volume of immigration from 1834 to 1914 amounted to a mere 50, 000 workers. Many African immigrants were children, and women, comprised about a quarter of the total. Taking into account deaths as well as the repatriation of immigrants, the overall impact of indentured labour migration upon the economic, demographic, and social character of Jamaica was, by comparison with Trinidad or British Guiana, exceedingly modest.

 THE IMPACT OF INDENTURED IMMIGRATION ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BRITISH GUIANA

 Alan H. Adamson

##### The abolition of slavery effected the colonies of the British Caribbean in widely differing ways. At one extreme were islands like Barbados and Antigua where population was dense and land ownership monopolised by a relatively small group of planters. Here the immediate consequences were minimal. The black workers went to bed on 31 July, 1838 apprentices waking on 1 August free but compelled to continue working on the estates. At the other extreme lay British Guiana. Here many abandoned plantations lay along the coast and a great deal of unoccupied land was available up the rivers; and here the freed slaves attempted to form themselves into an independent peasantry, moving away from the estates by the thousands. This produced a major crisis in plantation agriculture. Not only was the size of the labour force sharply reduced but it lost that docility and malleability which were characteristic under slavery. If he had not realized it before, the estate owner now made the discovery which Marx attributed to Gibbon Wakefield that ‘property in money, means of subsistence, machines and other means of production, does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative -the wage worker, the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free-will’.[1] And he certainly would have agreed with the colonial undersecretary, Herman Merivale, who observed that in ‘civilised countries [i.e. Europe] the labourer, though free, is by a law of nature dependent on capitalists; in colonies this dependence must be created by artificial means’.[2]
 As early as 1838, John Gladstone, the father of William Ewart and one of the larger slave and estate owners in British Guiana, had decided that the sugar plantations would have to be made ‘independent of our negro populatio’.[3] Between 1834 and 1848 the planters brought some 46, 514 immigrants to British Guiana from India, Madeira, the West Indies and


-----

##### Africa.[4] But despite this impressive number, only 12, 872 remained as estate labourers and only 19, 122 in the colony, by 1848.[5] The chief reason for this remarkable shrinkage was the death rate among unseasoned immigrants, especially those from India and Madeira. Thus the 1851 census could account for only 7, 670 East Indians although 11, 437 had been introduced between 1845 and 1849.[6] The second reason was that immigrants fled the estates whenever the opportunity arose. Large numbers of Madeirans went into petty trade after serving a one year contract, while liberated Africans and West Indians slipped into the newly formed creole villages. Although neither of these options was open to the average East Indian immigrant, large numbers of them did leave the estates, some even striking out for India through the bush, and their bones were now commonly seen whitening under the tropical sun, while their compatriots lay sick and dying in the public roads.[7]
 Ironically, the planters used these conditions to press not merely for more immigrants, but for immigrants bound by indenture. Their argument was summed up in 1849 by Governor Henry Barkly, himself an ex-planter:

 The disadvantages under which most of the British colonies labour in this competition [slave labour] do not arise from the dearness of Free Labour ... they are attributable almost entirely to the great difficulty of commanding continuous labour, which always constituted a crying evil in countries where exists a great deal of waste land and a very small population .... Immigration is the readiest palliative for this evil, but immigration without controls would require to be almost infinite in extent to produce any permanent effect upon the supply of labour in British Guiana.[8]

 Stated less circumspectly, Barkly was saying that when labour was not sufficiently cheap and servile the free play of market forces must be interrupted and an element of extra-economic compulsion introduced. In British Guiana this took the form of immigrant labour (chiefly from India) bound by five year renewable contracts.
 As Professor Green demonstrates in chapter one, coming so soon after the abolition of slavery, the acceptance of indentured labour presented the Colonial Office in London with a sticky issue all the stickier because many of those responsible for policy formulation in the ‘forties - Lord John


-----

##### Russell, Earl Grey, James Stephen and Herman Merivale - had been associated with the movement against slavery. In 1838, James Stephen - ‘Mr. Over-secretary’ - had lent his name to the labour code which forbade master and servant to enter into contracts outside the colony and which limited written contracts to one year. It was rightly regarded as a charter of free wage-labour which presumed an economy in which all the factors of production would find their proper level through the supply-demand mechanism. As colonial secretary in 1840, Russell had opposed lifting a temporary embargo on emigration from India, stating that he was ‘not prepared to encounter the responsibility of a measure which may lead to ... a new system of slavery’.[9]
 But Earl Grey, whose colonial secretaryship extended over the critical years 1846 to 1852, was the key figure in the decision to accept the principle of indenture. Grey carried the nostrums of laissez-faire in his bone marrow. As late as 1849, he was antagonistic to contracts of long duration. ‘No legal regulations, ’ he argued, ‘however severe, if they stop short of the extreme compulsion which is characteristic of slavery, can succeed in enforcing really efficient labour.’[10] But he also observed that in parts of the West Indies, ‘the facility of obtaining land effectually prevents the prosecution by voluntary labour of any enterprise requiring the cooperation of many hands.’[11] Sugar plantations and free labour, in other words, were incompatible.
 Grey was neither the first nor the last Victorian to find himself torn between devotion to abstract principle and the special claims of property. In his case, property emerged the easy victor. From 1854 until 1917, East Indian labour bound to the plantations by long indentures was an essential feature of the Guyanese economy. The planters had found their own peculiar institution to offset the effects of emancipation and what Eric Williams has called the nineteenth century counterpart of the encomienda had arrived. The real nature of what had been done was screened, as might be expected, by a cloud of mid-Victorian morality. Governor Barkly assured Grey that indenture should be supported ‘not so much for promoting industry as for the sake of securing the comfort and civilisation of the immigrants themselves’.[12] His successor, Governor Wodehouse, felt it was the ‘duty’ of the Colonial Office and the planters to place the immigrants ‘under such regulations as will promote their ... social improvement,

##### without reference to their own immediate wishes’.[13] Whether or not these gentlemen were impressed by their moral reflections is really irrelevant. What counts objectively is that the sugar planter had won the war for the soul of the Colonial Office and the humanitarians of Exeter Hall and the Anti-Slavery Society had lost.
 Over time, indentured immigration created a new labour force for the planter. It also established a new community which, for several generations resided in, but was not yet of, the colony. Guiana has been called an island almost entirely surrounded by land. The indentured immigrants might properly be called a community almost entirely surrounded by legislation. The major features of this community within the wider society are worth noting, since they are essential to an understanding of post-emancipation Guyanese history.
 The two characteristics which strike most for-ceably about the East Indian plantation labour force in the nineteenth century are its insulation and its immobility. These conditions did not arise ‘naturally’ or spontaneously, but were arranged deliberately by the planters through their control of the political institutions of the colony and were maintained in part at least by the failure of the Colonial Office to exercise its vaunted role of trusteeship. The basis of the system was a requirement that each immigrant work under contract to an estate for a period of five years, after which he received a certificate of ‘industrial residence’, or could, on receipt of a bounty from the planter, reindenture himself for a further five-year period. These fundamental conditions were in themselves rigorous enough but they were strengthened by several other restrictions. The 1854 ordinance governing immigration had included a clause granting the right to commute indentures at the end of the third or fourth years of service. Immigrants evidently took this right seriously since commutation payments increased over threefold between 1859 and 1862.[14] Seasoned labour carried an enhanced value and it was not uncommon for a planter to offer a bonus to an immigrant who would then commute his indenture and transfer at the end of his third or fourth year. If continued, this practice would certainly have injected an element of competition into the labour market and to that extent eased the rigidities of the indenture system. Yet indenture had been established primarily to eliminate any degree of competition. The upshot was that the Court of Policy abolished the right to commute in 1862, and in the following year established reinden-ture for five years without any right


-----

##### to change employers during that period. Its effect, noted the 1870 Royal Commission of Enquiry, was ‘to keep the immigrant population as a whole out of the free labour market’.[15]
 Insulation and immobility were also maintained through several other extra-economic devices, the most effective of which were the vagrancy laws and a clause in the Immigration Ordinance which forbade an immigrant to leave an estate without a written pass from the manager. Since the law only authorised, but did not compel the employer to issue a pass, it could be used to keep the immigrants in a state of virtual imprisonment. So loosely were these statutes interpreted that they sometimes impinged on immigrants who were no longer indentured. In 1855, for example, a free immigrant was seized by the police in Georgetown, jailed and then sent to Plantation La Jalousie. ‘No coolie’ he was told, ‘could remain in the city, ... all must go to the estates. ’[16] Indeed, it was a well known boast of the planters that every immigrant ought to be either in the fields at work, in hospital, or in jail. Chief Justice Beaumont illustrated the extreme abuse of the pass regulations with the story of an immigrant who had come to Georgetown in response to a subpoena to appear in court as a witness against his employer and who was then thrown into jail for being absent from his estate without leave.[17]
 Ignorance was also an essential element in maintaining the immigrants in a hermetic condition. This note was struck at the outset of Indian immigration, when Gillanders and Co. assured John Gladstone that there would be no difficulty recruiting labourers for Guiana, since ‘the Natives
 [were] perfectly ignorant of the place they agree to go to and the length of the voyage they are undertaking’.[18] At the end of the century, when the supply of labour was ample, planters were reluctant to take on reindentured people because

 They know the ropes and will hardly allow themselves to be cheated out of their rights, whereas a newly arrived simpleton, in his blissful ignorance, will have to grin and take what is given him.[19]

 In 1904, the Executive Council decided to disallow free passage to immigrants who had returned to India, and to forbid their reindenture if they did return. They caused trouble, putting ‘mischievous ideas’ into the immigrants heads; they were ‘too independent and up to the tricks of the


-----

##### trade’. In Calcutta, the Emigration Agent, R.W.S. Mitchell, dropped a significant remark. When he had been Immigration Agent-General in 1881- 83 the only returnees who ‘gave trouble’ were those who had previously been in Jamaica, ‘where no doubt they became imbued with ideas as regards the “rights of man” which do not prevail in other colonies’.[20]
 It is difficult to exaggerate the impact which this system had on post- emancipation Guyanese society. Immigration destroyed the temporary power which free black workers had enjoyed immediately after 1838; and it gradually restored to the estate proprietors the command of the labour market which they had possessed under slavery. The number of labourers resident on estates rose from 15, 392 in 1852 to 50, 487 in 1872, and stood at 72, 793 in 1904.[21]
 The first significant result of this steadily growing force was that planters were able to drive down wages. By the’sixties, official and unofficial observers agreed that wages were markedly below the high level attained in the early ‘forties. This downward trend continued until the mid-’seventies, when a failure of the European sugar beet crop appears to have lifted rates for a few years. By 1879, however, a labour surplus had reappeared and wages were once again moving downward, a movement accentuated by major crises in the world sugar market, one in 1884-85 and another in 1894- 97.[22] Though precise data on the extent of the fall in wage rates after 1884 is unavailable partial evidence suggests that it was considerable. A magisterial investigation at Plantation Turkeyen in 1885 revealed daily earnings which ranged from four to eight cents per day, when the statutory minimum for indentured immigrants was twenty-four cents.[23] In February 1889, an inquest held on Govinder, an indentured immigrant found dead on the beach at Plantation Hamburg, disclosed that he had deserted from Plantation Johanna Cecilia, after having been paid for a ‘considerable time’ at eight cents per day. He had complained to the Immigration Sub-Agent, but the latter had refused to intervene on the ground that Govinder’s earnings were not much, if at all, lower than those of other immigrants on the plantation.[24] A general impression of the extent of the decline may be gathered from the global wage bill of the sugar estates, which dropped from $6, 500, 000 in 1882 to an annual average of $2, 575, 350 in 1901-04. Using a weighted index of basic food prices for the period 1884-1904, it is


-----

##### estimated that the drop in global real earnings in the sugar sector was just under fifty per cent.[25]
 The effect of the planter’s increasing control over the labour force can be seen also in his changing attitude to reindenture. In the ‘fifties and’sixties, he had regarded reindenture as an integral feature of his economy, almost as vital as indenture itself, and as late as September, 1873, he was defending it vigorously with the argument that steady wages and a chance to use the reindenture bounty gave the immigrant a kind of security he could never hope to achieve as a free person. Yet three months later, reindenture had’silently expired without one word of regret from its former most strenuous supporters’.[26] The immediate occasion for this sudden change was an alteration in the method of financing immigration which raised the cost to the planter and left him proportionately less to pay out in reindenture bounties. But the surprising indifference of most planters to the end of reindenture suggests a more important change. Steady immigration had, by the’seventies, raised the numerical level of the plantation labour force to the point where the planter could control and discipline it with less resort to extra-economic devices. Immigration continued at a respectable level right up to the major crisis of 1894-95 - indeed without it the population of the colony would have declined - but the relative importance of the indentured labourer dropped rapidly from seventy-four per cent of the resident labour force in 1873 to twenty-four per cent in 1884.[27] At the same time, the number of resident labourers per acre of cultivated cane rose from 0.67 in 1871 to 0.83 in 1884.[28] By 1881 some large estates - notably those owned by James Ewing and Co. - were running almost exclusively on free labour.[29] It was becoming increasingly difficult to defend indenture except as a means of keeping labour cheap.
 To the extent that indentured immigration imprisoned the East Indian on the sugar estate, it segregated him from the creole villager and diminished whatever possibility may have existed for mutual acculturation. Long before Furnivall and Smith developed the concept, the planters very early found that a pluralistic colony presented them with a convenient opportunity to enhance their control over the labour force. During the plantation strikes of 1847-48 those who continued to work were the recently arrived Portuguese, East Indians and liberated Africans from Sierra Leone. ‘I think the safety of the whites, ’ wrote one manager, ‘depends very much


-----

##### upon the want of union in the different races.’[30] Twenty years later it was the East Indian, toughened by a generation of indenture, who commonly struck, while the semi-peasant black villager was likely to be the strike- breaker. The 1870 Royal Commission noted the significance of this disunity:

 The coolie despises the negro because he considers him ... not so highly civilised as himself, while the negro despises the coolie because he is so immensely inferior to himself in physical strength. There will never be much danger of seditious disturbances among the East Indian immigrants ... so long as large numbers of negroes continue to be employed with them.

 The Commission also observed that Chinese labourers never combined with East Indians during estate disturbances.[31] The planters saw these cultural incompatibilities as a distinct advantage. ‘They do not intermix’, J.E. Tinne told the West Indies Royal Commission of 1897. ‘That is, of course, one of our great safeties in the Colony when there has been any rioting. If the negroes were troublesome, every coolie on the estate would stand by one. If the coolies attacked me, I could with confidence trust my negro friends for keeping me from injury.’[32]
 Indentured immigration affected the course of Guyanese history in another, indirect way. Its cost was not borne entirely by the sugar estates on whose exclusive behalf it was undertaken, but was financed partly out of the public revenue, ‘a bonus paid by the community for the production of sugar’, as one Governor described it.[33] Thus, from 1847 to 1873 the burden of immigration costs ranged between 22 and 34 per cent of total public expenditures.[34] At the same time revenue was raised largely through indirect taxes falling most heavily on indentured immigrants and the negro peasantry. Between 1850 and 1904, customs duties, the rum excise and retail spirit licenses accounted for never less than 50 and often as high as 72 per cent of total public revenue.[35]
 Flour, rice, dried fish and salt pork alone contributed more than half the total value of importduties in 1850. That the import duties were consciously arranged so as to strike the immigrants and peasantry and avoid the planters is transparently obvious when one examines the list of articles exempt from

##### duty. In 1850, a not untypical year, this included diamonds, ice, fresh fish, meat, fruit and vegetables, manures and machinery.[36]
 Thus the immigrants and the villagers, consumers of highly taxed commodities of mass consumption, became involuntary investors in the sugar sector and their own capacity for independent development was correspondingly reduced. While they were effectively stripped of potential capital, the state concentrated its resources upon strengthening the plantation system. Basic needs as irrigation, water supply, sea defence, roads and education were left in a condition of notorious neglect.
 This state-supported concentration of capital in sugar was undoubtedly sufficient in itself to frustrate alternative forms of enterprise, but it was reinforced in turn by a land policy which placed an artificially high price on Crown Land and prohibited its purchase in parcels of less than 100 acres. Thus, one more obstacle was placed in the path of the creole peasantry and the East Indian immigrant, who was held on or around the plantations during most of the nineteenth century, even after he had served his indenture. Significantly, a more liberal land policy was not adopted until the crisis of 1894-97 created a high level of chronic unemployment and the demand for cheap land had to be met. The rise of a rice-growing East Indian peasantry stems from this period.[37]
 In perspective, indentured immigration can be seen as an essential part of that complex process through which the sugar economy in British Guiana survived the double blows of slave emancipation and free trade. This was clearly understood at the time. Planters naturally argued that without it sugar would have collapsed and, as one zealous estate owner put it, sugar had kept British Guiana ‘the one civilised spot on the continent of America’.[38] Such views were not seriously contested until the riots of 1869 and the Royal Commission of Enquiry which followed them questioned the quality of the planters’ stewardship in particular and the role of sugar in general. Even then, opposition came not from organised groups but rather from individuals such as the English barrister Edward Jenkins, ex-Chief Justice Joseph Beaumont, ex-Magistrate G.W. Des Voeux, and local isolated men like R.K. Whitfield. When Whitfield wrote in 1873 that, ‘the shadow of the sugar cane kills all other vegetation and chills all other industries’,[39]
 few took him seriously. Ten years later matters had begun to change. That section of the Georgetown merchants who depended on food imports for the bulk of their earnings emerged in the elections of 1883 as the advocates of

##### reduced import duties, a re-structured public budget designed to develop the non-sugar sectors of the economy. They supported the cessation of the public subsidy to immigration.[40] This small group had neither the numbers nor the economic power to confront the great sugar oligarchs, but they were aware of the need to diversify. One year later world sugar prices collapsed and with them the entire Guyanese economy. The governor of the day felt that the hegemony of sugar had ‘prejudicially affected’ all other interests in the colony.[41]
 Opposition to sugar and to immigration grew somewhat stronger in the ‘nineties, following the constitutional changes of 1891 and the second world sugar crisis of 1894-97. For the first time the Combined Court contained a minority, led by the black barrister Patrick Dargan, which reflected the interests of the creole petty middle class, and which opposed the sugar oligarchy by criticising the public subvention of immigration costs.[42] But it was a fragile group and the estate owners apparently had little difficulty in buying it off. When governor Swettenham fought the planters in 1904 over his right to remove immigrants from plantations when he felt they were improperly treated, Dargan broke away from his own party and introduced a motion censuring the Governor for which only the planting members of the Combined Court voted.[43]
 The attitude of the Colonial Office to indentured immigration reveals no inner logic or meaningful pattern except expediency and capitulation to pressure. In the hands of the West India Association it was, as Edward Wingfield said of a weak governor, ‘very squeezable’. After it had accepted the principle of indenture, control of the situation in the colony passed effectively into the planters’ hands. Henry Taylor, head of the West India department, had seen the shape of the future. As early as 1838, he had suggested that all West Indian legislatures be abolished and authority concentrated wholly in imperial hands. Otherwise, he felt the planters’ oligarchic position in local politics would submerge all other interests and would force the Colonial Office to cooperate.[44] He confirmed the soundness of his own judgment three decades later when he defined the colony as

 a merchants’ and planters’ oligarchy not much tempered, perhaps, by any apprehension that the Crown will really exert the latent power it claims of supreme and absolute legislation .... There is always this derogation from the power of the Crown in Crown Colonies, that where taxation

##### and the purses of the planters are in question, the West India Committee and the House of Commons make a formidable appearance in the background.[45]

 Joseph Chamberlain’s administration of the Colonial Office at the end of the century was the exception which proved the rule. Full of his dream of undeveloped estates of Empire, Chamberlain was less impressed than his predecessors with the view that the interests of sugar and the colony were identical. The sugar depression convinced him that British Guiana would have to diversify its economy, especially in the direction of gold and diamond mining. It was ‘really impossible’ he wrote in 1898, ‘to deal with the West Indian cuestion on the lines which commend themselves to the planter’.[46] But five years later his develooment schemes had failed and the steady pressure of the West India Association had worn him down. When a group of radicals in the colony sent him a petition opposing immigration, he dismissed it, remarking that capital would not go where the supply of labour was not ‘adecúate and moderately secure’. Native labour had shown itself unable to undertake the proper development of the colony and immigration was therefore the only answer. Furthermore, its benefit to the colony as a whole justified a public contribution to its cost.[47] The wheel of policy had come full circle.
 Throughout this debate, the voice of the indentured immigrant was rarely heard. Isolated, illiterate and without experienced leaders, he expressed his feelings in the inchoate, spontaneous ‘riots’ and ‘disturbances’ which shook the sugar coast in sporadic bursts from the’sixties onwards. The one piece of direct verbal evidence from the nineteenth century was the testimony of Bechu, an exceptionally articulate immigrant who appeared before the West Indies Royal Commission of 1897. The plantation labour system which Bechu described certainly deserved the appellation earlier given it by Chief Justice Beaumont, ‘The New Slavery’. The common immigrant experience was to be overworked, underpaid and robbed by drivers, overseers and managers alike. Nor could he hope to find redress under the law, for magistrates, medical officers and immigration agents were, with few exceptions, as G.W. Des Voeux had charged in 1869, ’subject to the planting interest’.[48]
 But the most moving statement of the immigrant experience is, significantly, non-verbal. It is a woodcut done by a Chinese labourer and it

##### makes a remarkably poignant and incisive comment on the human condition in plantation society.[49] In it the workers, Chinese and Indian, are gathered round the manager’s house, their arms bound, symbolising indenture. Drivers attend the workers, drawing blood from their breasts, which is caught in swizzle glasses and carried by boys to the manager and attorney, who cool themselves on the verandah. In a corner of the verandah stands a pay-table where overseers arrange wage-stoppages. The English owners and their families - happy, healthy and absentee - appear through a break in the wall.
 Indenture was discontinued in 1917 and immigration subsided shortly thereafter. By that time, however, the effects of both were irreversible. The economy of Guiana remained monocultural while the society which evolved after 1838 became increasingly bicultural or pluralistic. Economic monoculturalism and cultural pluralism - each carries with it a host of knotty problems and these represent the dubious legacy which 200 years of sugar and 450 years of colonialism have bequeathed to the now independent state of Guiana.

 INDENTURED LABOUR IN TRINIDAD 1880-1917

 Marianne D. Ramesar

##### After emancipation in 1834, the formerly Spanish possession of Trinidad, along with other British West Indian possessions experimented with various forms of unfree labour in the sugar and other tropical industries. Even during slavery, however, Trinidad, despite its fertile and relatively abundant land and high productivity of the chattels, had suffered extensive labour shortages.[1] Apprenticeship of former bondsmen and bondswomen was extensively employed until 1838. From 1845 onwards, with several interruptions, the indenture of imported workers, most notably from India, became the most widely used solution to these labour difficulties. In the years 1838 to 1865 over 96, 000 Indians embarked upon terms of servitude to the British West Indian colonies and Guiana with nearly one third (29, 254) alone going to Trinidad.[2]
 In the 1850s Indians were contracted to labour in Trinidad for periods of three years‘ servitude but by 1862, five year contracts were generally in use. Trinidad, unlike other sugar colonies, offered labourers a stake in the colony when the years of industrial residence were completed. For instance, in 1851, a £10 bounty was offered to any imported servant who forfeited the return passage and decided to remain permanently. In 1869, a land grant in lieu of a bounty was given to any Indian who had been in the colony for ten years. Four years later the government stipulated that the grant should consist of 5 acres with £5 in cash and an additional £5 if a wife was resident.[3] But since these procedures did not altogether solve the ever present labour shortages, planters demanded and secured a continued and increased supply of indentured labourers from India from 1845 to 1917. Trinidad did not solely rely upon this source. In the years until 1865, over 10, 000 blacks from other areas in the Caribbean, most notably the densely populated areas of Barbados and the Leewards,[5] as well as Brazil, Cuba and the USA[6]
 embarked upon forms of servitude in this more recently developed colony.

##### More sophisticated and elaborate technology could be used more effectively in Trinidad than in the older settled colonies like Jamaica. Most important was the use of large efficient central mills which could process the cane from many estates. At the Usine St Madeleine mill, for instance, cane from thirty estates could be crushed.[7] It is evident that following the near bankruptcy at the end of the 1840s, the period from the mid 1860s to the early 1880s when the prices for sugar on the international market, though gradually falling, remained relatively high, witnessed great expansion in the sugar industry (see Tables 3.1 and 3.2).

##### The employment of vast numbers of indentured servants as well as structural rationalization contributed to expansion in Trinidad’s sugar industry.
 It is not however the intention of this chapter to examine in great detail this particularly complex process; rather it concentrates upon the status and role of indentured labour in the period after the crisis of 1883 when sugar prices plummeted. More specifically, it questions why indentured servants were regarded as being absolutely necessary, given the curtailed expansion of the sugar estates. It also examines the question of why the number of immigrants requested rose rather than fell at this time. Finally, it seeks an explanation for continued state assistance, despite the opposition in both England and Trinidad to the continuation of a supposedly objectionable system.
 The report of the Royal Commission into the West Indies in 1897 remarked that:


-----

##### ... At the present time, and under present conditions indentured labourers are absolutely necessary to the carrying on of the sugar estates .... We are, however, of the opinion that the number of immigrants to be introduced every year should be reduced to the minimum that will suffice for the working of the existing estates, and that State assistance in aid of immigration should ultimately cease.[8]

 All of these recommendations did not find favour with the sugar planters of Trinidad, who argued that given their small margin of profit, they desperately needed unfree labour for free labour was far too expensive. Also the provision of indentured service was a form of compensation which the British government owed them for maintaining a free trade policy which allowed European beet sugar to compete more than favourably with their tropically-cultivated product.[9] Ultimately too the presence of bonded labourers enabled employers to maintain independence from the demands of both free black and Indian labour and also to manipulate the available workforce to their own advantage. Surgeon-Major D.W.D. Comins, Protector of Emigrants at Calcutta, in his survey of the conditions of Indians in the West Indies in 1893 correctly assessed this aspect when he reported to the Government of India that:

 ... it is of immense value to the manager of an estate to have a body of labourers under his complete control whom he may direct to take up any work that may be pressing, instead of having to go into the villages and call for volunteers, who may or may not come on their own terms. Moreover, the presence of a body of labourers under the complete control of the master makes him more or less independent of outside labour and brings down the price of free labour in the neighbourhood.[10]

 During this period of depression and relatively low demand for labour in the sugar industry, the bargaining power of free labourers was undermined through a number of tactics. For instance, the wage rate for the indentureds was made to set the standard for free labour, and this policy induced wage reduction, or at least, wage stabilisation.
 Since the ‘fifties the price of a single task for ‘ordinary’ field labour had fallen from 40 to 25 cents, under the impact of the regular influx of indentured labourers. However, during the era of good sugar prices and scarce labour, which occurred from the mid-1860s up to the 1880s, the


-----

##### standard wage was frequently exceeded in order to get work done, especially during the crop season. Cane-cutting might then be paid at the rate of 30 cents, increasing to 35 cents for a second task. The 25 cent rate for weeding would be increased by a 5 cent bonus per task, if 6 tasks per week were completed. In this way, the free labourer customarily earned 45 to 60 cents per day for one or more tasks.[11] In addition, skilled labourers, especially artisans and factory operatives, most of whom were blacks, enjoyed much higher wage rates than field labourers. The ‘time-expired’ Indians, who were regarded as valuable seasoned workers, were commonly offered a bounty of $10 to $15 on the completion of the indenture contract, if they accepted re- indenture for an additional year.
 In response to the sharp decline in sugar prices from the mid-1880s, however, the planters moved to reduce wages. This was one method to minimise their production costs. The wage rates for skilled labour too were substantially lowered.[12] The indentured labourer’s wage rate of 25 cents per day or per task, originally intended as a minimum rate, was used as the yardstick for the wages of unskilled labour, instead of the other way around. During 1886, free labourers in Chaguanas, for example, were desperate enough to accept the low rate of 20 cents. This only lasted temporarily since it precipitated the exodus of free labour from the estates into the available alternative of settlement on the Crown Lands. The planters were therefore obliged to offer more acceptable wages, especially in crop time.[13] The introduction of indentured labourers also affected wages in sectors other than sugar. The cocoa industry mostly used free labour. Once the large cocoa proprietors in the Montserrat district, for instance, had satisfied the legal requirements for obtaining indentured labour, the basic wage rate of 30 to 40 cents per task fell to 25 cents.[14]
 During the crisis period, only a limited amount of work was ever offered. Only one task was permitted as a rule, and this resulted in reduced earnings for all labourers, whether free or indentured. In 1895 (during the second crisis of 1894-97), the Protector of Immigrants revealed that a significant proportion of the indentureds were earning less than 12 cents per day.[15]
 Multiple tasks had been common during the early post-emancipation period of scarce labour. Then it was estimated that a task was the amount of work which could be performed by an able-bodied labourer in about 4 hours. There was work in abundance to enable the average labourer to complete 2 to 2½ tasks per day, since overseers were often willing to accept hastily-done


-----

##### work. When more labour became available during the 1870s, following the steady annual inflow of Indian and British West Indian immigrants, employers could become more exacting. The size of the task was increased to take 5 or 6 hours. Still 1½ to 2 tasks could be undertaken daily. During the depression of the 1880s, the size of the average task was further increased to the point where it was estimated to take an average labourer about 7 hours to complete, and only one task per day was permitted.[16]
 These trends were exacerbated by the presence of the indentureds who became the crucial ‘core’ group. It was not however merely a question of numbers. There was indeed an increased ratio of indentured to free labourers in the estates’ labour force during the 1890s.[17]

 Table 3.3: Indian Population[a] and its Status in Trinidad, 1879 to 1908

 Table 3.4: Estimated Numbers of Introduced and Repatriated, 1879


-----

##### More important was the role of indentured labour as a kind of ‘insurance’ for the employer against total dependence on ‘outside’ labour. Therefore, the estate owner could ignore the existing free labour in the neighbourhood, utilising only indentured workers at fixed prices, thereby minimising the overall wage bill. But the employment of an insufficient number of free labourers could result in a short crop which in turn required less labour in the future.[18] Both free Indians and blacks were affected by these procedures - the immigration system was discontinued and the blacks found that Indians began to be utilised in jobs which had formerly been their preserve.[19] The overall result of these various tactics was the stabilisation or reduction in wage rates for the workers and economic survival for the employers.
 The Report of the Committee on Indian Emigration to the Crown Colonies and Protectorates (commonly known as the Sanderson Report) noted in 1910 that:

 It is probably the fact that during a period of severe crisis, the supply of imported labour at a fixed rate of wages enabled the estates to carry on their operations, when if exposed to the serious fluctuations in the supply and price of labour, they would have collapsed.[20]

 For the labourer however underemployment or unemployment was the outcome. Yet the planters continued to clamour for additional indentured immigrants, although it was anticipated that this would lead to further


-----

##### deterioration of the estate labourer’s prospects. As D.W.D. Comins reported in 1893:

 Notwithstanding the difficulty of finding work in sufficient quantity during the slack season for both indentured and free immigrants, the planters still demand more labour and would like to see larger importations from India ... the price of both free and indentured labour, already falling, would become still lower, and except in crop-time there would be ... insufficient work to employ all of both classes.[21]

 Nor were the adverse effects on the indentureds’ position allowed to deter further immigration from India. The evidence of reduced earnings caused controversy, but this involved problem was not decided on the issue of labour demand. Trinidad’s immigration laws provided safeguards against the underemployment of these labourers. Accordingly, any plantation on which 15 per cent or more of the able-bodied male indentured immigrants failed to earn a minimum of 12 cents per day during the year, stood to forfeit the right to further supplies of immigrants during the following season, unless exempted by the governor.[22] The planters’ agents blamed the labourers’ shortcomings for their substandard earnings. Instead of heeding the overwhelming evidence of inadequate available work. Colonial Office officials made concessions to the planters, who were further urged to use the legal provisions for extracting work from their indentured servants.[23] At the same time the law was revised in the employer’ s favour to enable an increased proportion (30 per cent) of able-bodied male indentureds to earn sub-minimum wages before any estate was penalised.[24] Usually estates were not subject to the enforcement of this penalty. Consequently, those indentureds who were rated as less than able-bodied suffered even more dismal earnings without any legal recourse.[25]
 The planters regarded the institution of indentured labour as a form of ‘compensation’ owed them by the British government for the adverse effects of its economic policies. In this respect they received the support of some of the colonial authorities, namely, the governor of Trinidad, Sir Napier Broome, who pleaded in 1895 that the sugar industry needed ‘to ride as light as possible’ since ‘it was riding for its life’.[26] At the Colonial Office, Charles P. Lucas, who was responsible for West Indian business between 1897 and 1906, also championed the planters’ cause when he noted that:


-----

##### ... [Planters] have suffered, not for their own sins, but through abnormal interference with trade, which the English Government has not prevented ... The Imperial taxpayer compensated the West Indian slaveholder, and the present case for compensation is, from one point of view, even stronger, for the taxpayer has been enriched pari passu with the ruin of the sugar planter and from identically the same cause ...[27]

 This was not the first crisis period when similar arguments had been advanced asserting that imported labour was essential for sugar production in the late-developed colony of Trinidad. During the post-emancipation period, the wage demands of free labourers had been considered prohibitive. The planters had demanded and received imported labour as a kind of ‘compensation’ for the abolition of centuries of preferential duties.
 In relatively prosperous periods as well, for instance during the years 1865 and 1883, when good prices made a programme of rationalisation possible, the planters also pressed for more indentured labourers. Yet for much of this period there was an available pool of experienced free labourers. Until the mid-1870s or 1880s this group had few alternatives except to continue labour on the estates where they had formerly been indentured. Though the new generation of blacks shunned field labour on the estates, they were employed in other essential occupations within the industry.[28]
 Representatives of the sugar industry complained to the Labour Committee of 1905 that free labour, especially free black labour, was dearer than they could afford, despite several more lucrative alternatives in agriculture and in other areas. Though some employers reduced the size of the task which was equivalent to increasing wages,[29] most planters rejected calls for general wage increases and better conditions, arguing that these would force up their production costs, and inhibit their competitiveness and therefore their recovery.[30] Instead they sought and were granted an increased quota of indentured labourers at fixed prices.[31] Later in 1908 the law was amended to permit the planters to pay an additional wage allowance in order to obtain free labourers on a seasonal basis only as employers needed them. The new wages did not apply however to their indentured labourers.[32] This practice reversed the long-held policy whereby indentured immigrants were paid at the rates obtaining for local free labour, in order to maintain current wage levels. Agents of the large Colonial Company demonstrated how, by increasing its use of indentured labourers, the Company was able to hold

##### down labour costs with little structural change. This had lasted for nearly 20 years, including periods both of labour surplus and shortage (see Table 3.5).

 Table 3.5: Cost of Field Labour on the Colonial Company's Estates, Trinidad, 1891 to 1909

 The second attractive feature of indentured service, in a period of competition for labour, was its ‘reliability’. Eventually all other forms of labour were claimed to be less reliable. First the ‘creole’, or native-born black, was steadily discredited. Next the imported British West Indian, although highly-regarded in other occupational fields, was regarded as ‘unreliable’ for regular routine cultivation on the sugar estates. Officials at the Colonial Office were forced to concede that the planters ultimately did not want British West Indian labour.[33]
 It was never a question of the quality of the work. Representative spokesmen asserted that ‘both East Indian and Creoles are equally good’, though the latter were admittedly superior in particular lines of work.[34] Once the Indian attained a position where he could choose between occupational alternatives, he too lost value as an estate labourer. As George White informed the 1906 Committee on Labour in Trinidad:


-----

##### The free man [the East Indian] is the more valuable because he is better trained, but you cannot rely upon him with the certainty that you can rely on the indentured labourer.[35]

 This assessment was echoed by William Greig, a manager with 20 years experience on the large sugar estates in Trinidad: ‘They [the indentureds] are more under control. You can rely on them ... He [the free East Indian] is not so reliable, however, and you cannot depend on him just when you need him.’[36]
 CP. David, a persistent opponent of indentured immigration and a member of the Trinidad Legislative Council, pin-pointed the essential importance of the system:

 ... the value, to the planter, of the Indian labour consists rather in the state of indenture than anything else. What he wants is an indentured labourer - not so much a labourer as an indentured labourer ... somebody who is bound to him for 5 years, and liable to be committed to prison for disobeying orders, and although the volume of free labour might increase, I expect that you would find that the demand for indentured labour would not diminish.[37]

 This statement was made to the Sanderson Committee in 1909 at a time when some measure of unemployment was openly acknowledged. Spokesmen like Lord Stanmore, formerly governor of Trinidad, asserted that the present generation of blacks was as amenable to normal working conditions as any other class of labourers.[38] Yet the demand for immigrant Indians did not diminish. Because of the peculiar characteristics of the indenture system, its influence was profound and enduring.
 The indentured labour system undoubtedly provided the proprietors of sugar estates in Trinidad with a reliable workforce. Essential features of the system included a contract which bound the labourer to a particular employer for a set period (5 years for most of the duration), and to a required work output (280 days per annum for able-bodied labourers). Restrictions on the labourer included compulsory residence on the estate, and limited movement outside it. The most objectionable part of the system was the routine imposition of criminal penalties, including imprisonment, for labour offences; for example, the refusal to work or to complete assigned tasks.

##### Despite the official monitoring of indenture conditions, and the reform of abuses, the system retained several problems. Low earnings became common after the 1890s. During 1899 to 1904, the average daily earnings of indentureds on task work was a little over 18 cents,[39] although 25 cents had been set as the legal minimum. One important contributing factor to low productivity was the employees’ poor health. In 1905-6, the colony’s Surgeon-General attached the gravest importance to the prevalence of diseases such as hookworm, which induced anaemia and other debilitating diseases, causing permanently impaired energy.[40] The imbalance in the sex ratio of the incoming immigrants contributed to the further demoralisation of workers.
 Even the employers, who fought to retain the system, admitted that it had several disadvantages. First, it was costly to both the colony and to the importer of labour. The attendant red tape was burdensome. As a labour system, it was wasteful and inefficient (see Table 3.6).

 Table 3.6: Work Performance by Indentured Labourers on the Colonial Company's Estates, Trinidad, 1892-1908


-----

##### In 1905 an estimated 12 per cent of the total indentured workforce was classed as ‘ineffectives’, who spent considerable time in hospital.[41] When challenged, the employers blamed the quality of those recruited in India. While insisting that their indentured labourers were essential, employers


-----

##### admitted that, as workers, they were inexperienced, and generally inferior to free labour. The planter, W.G. Kay, asserted that ‘We make the best of them and some are very good. Some are very poor, so take them as a whole they are a mediocre lot.’[42]
 Records of work performance conclusively demonstrated its inefficiency. In general, during the 7-year period, 1899 to 1905, 15 per cent of the total body of indentureds had been prosecuted per annum, for desertion, unauthorised absence, habitual idleness, malingering and vagrancy.[43] The high proportion of prosecutions for work offences continued to attract criticism until the end of the system. As a result the official observers, McNeill and Chimman Lai, reported to the Government of India in 1913 that ‘the system was bad and oppressive ...’[44]
 Estate labour became badly-paid drudgery, and irregular employment. It had become accepted that, under prevailing conditions, sugar production needed an unskilled, routine workforce, whose output would remain low and who were precluded from obtaining increased wages. The Labour Committee of 1905 took it for granted that ‘ ... a very high standard of industry cannot reasonably be expected from field labour in a tropical country’. On the other hand, leading immigrants like Abdul Aziz, and missionaries like K.J. Grant, urged the improvement of wages and working conditions so as to attract free labourers.[45] These pleas were intended to halt the trend whereby free labour quit regular employment on the estates. Reports from the large St Madeleine Estate in 1906 had showed that the numbers of black field labourers had decreased by 60 per cent during the previous decade. The numbers also of regular Indian estate labourers had fallen by 13 per cent.[46] An increasing number of labourers found occupations in cane farming, in the cultivation of rice and vegetables and especially in cocoa planting. The planters, admitting that these former labourers were better off outside the estates,[47] applied pressure to increase the quota of indentured labourers who replaced them.[48]
 Thus the indenture system mitigated against the development of a permanent workforce for estate cultivation. Fresh recruits had to be regularly imported. Blacks moved increasingly to the sugar factory or to work on the roads - at better rates of pay. So the labour force became increasingly divided along ethnic lines. This tendency was accentuated after the First World War, when the mineral industries developed, attracting a black workforce. The

##### descendants of the indentured Indians remained the majority in the agricultural sector.[49]
 Despite the recommendations of the West India Royal Commission of 1897 for the phasing out of both indentured immigration and state subsidies, the system persisted. It was finally terminated, not as the result of opposition in Trinidad or in Britain, but under mounting nationalist pressure in India. The contemporary view had been that Trinidad, having been settled and developed relatively late by the British, lacked population - including a labouring population -commensurate with its land area and resources. One official report published in connection with the 1871 Census, advised that Trinidad (with a population of 109, 638) needed to gain (from immigration and natural increase) a total of some 1½ million persons. In 1909, Trinidad was said to need a population of one million, or 500 persons to the square mile[51] (roughly its present position in 1981). But this was no longer to come from India.
 Apart from the official advocates of a general increase in population, there were however those who continued to favour Indians as a desirable element in the population.[52] Yet the Colonial Office officials were aware that the Trinidad planters wanted only indentured Indians.[53] British West Indians were a welcome addition to the labour pool for most of the nineteenth century. Leading Trinidad spokesmen, notably Dr J. De Boissiere, and later Dr S.M. Laurence, strongly advocated schemes to encourage West Indians from the neighbouring islands to fulfil Trinidad’s labour needs, and to replace the Indians. But once the regular flow of subsidised contract labour had been established, the planters resisted any such change.
 The Colonial Office officials acquiesced with regard to these views, recognising that the prevailing conditions on the estates had become increasingly unacceptable to free, especially black, labour. In 1906 Cox minuted that the ‘Negro’s natural disinclination’ to agricultural labour stemmed perhaps from the uncertainty and irregularity of employment on the sugar estates. He concluded therefore that the development of independent labour on the Crown Lands could not be discouraged in order to help the employers, i.e. by re-imposing obstacles to the acquisition of the Crown Lands.[54]
 The improvement of labouring conditions on the estates was therefore urged by some officials as a preferable alternative merely to increasing the numbers of labourers through immigration. On occasion, officials


-----

##### discouraged the policy of giving the estates all the labour they called for, recommending instead that they should ‘elevate the negro (i.e. the native labourer) through higher wages and labour-saving mechanisms’.[55] Other authorities acknowledged that the sugar industry was limited by financial, and not labour shortages.[56]
 The sugar industry retained its favoured position even during the twentieth century, when cocoa surpassed it in extent and value. By the end of the nineteenth century, most Trinidad sugar estates, in common with other sugar producing areas like Fiji and Queensland, had been acquired and amalgamated by a few substantial individuals and firms with sufficient resources to undertake programmes of rationalisation. These included: the Colonial Company, Greig and Company, Turnbull and Company, Sir Charles Tennant and the Lamont family.[57] Most firms and their shareholders were based in England. Their economic power was considerable. Their channels of influence were several. Successive Trinidad governors, notably Sir William Robinson and Sir Napier Broome acknowledged this: ‘The interests concerned are ... very large and very strong, in London as well as in Trinidad.’[58] Their continued influence was ensured especially in a conquered British colony like Trinidad which contained a second proprietary class, namely the French Creole cocoa planters, who had retained some hostility to their British rulers throughout the first half of the nineteenth century.
 By the end of the century, however, both cocoa and sugar proprietors drew together to further their common interests, particularly the use of immigrant labour and the continuation of state assistance towards its maintenance. Indentured immigration was costly, remaining one of the largest Heads of Expenditure in the Trinidad budget, involving the provision of the Immigration Department and the Medical and other government institutions. In India too there was the upkeep of the administrative establishment as well as the costs involved in recruiting, introducing and repatriating the immigrants. These expenses were met from an Immigration Fund. To this the planters contributed about two-thirds: through direct indenture fees paid by those who employed indentureds, and indirect taxes on the major exports of the producers, whether or not they employed indentured labourers. The remaining one-third of the Fund’s expenses came from the General Revenue, and was derived mainly from indirect taxation, much of which fell heavily on the broad inass. of taxpayers.[59] The imposition of one-third of the total cost of Immigration on the General Revenue had been sanctioned since 1861

##### by the Duke of Newcastle, as Secretary of State, on the grounds that Trinidad thereby gained much-needed population.[60]
 This formula was retained despite periodic attempts by the planter- dominated committees of the Trinidad Legislative Council to increase the proportion contributed by the General Revenue. On the other hand, a handful of opponents of state assistance to immigration voiced their opinion. These were Robert Guppy, H.A. Alcazar, CP. David and S.M. Laurence in the Legislative Council and the Trinidad Workingmen’s Association.
 Throughout the attendant controversy, the Colonial Office remained decisively lenient towards the Trinidad planters. Whereas British Guiana had to revise its methods of financing indentured immigration in 1902, to avoid charges that the contribution from the General Revenue constituted a ‘bounty’ to the sugar industry, Trinidad successfully resisted these. Until 1906 one official doubted whether Trinidad could be made to fall in line with the modified fiscal system of Guiana, since ‘We have always been beaten on that point, or given way to cogent argument’.[61] One such argument was that immigrant labour was utilised in all Trinidad’s industries, not only in sugar production as in Guiana. Therefore the Trinidad taxpayer should contribute to this general means of development.
 During the twentieth century the stress was on the colony’s ability to pay. In 1903 the planters were made to contribute annually to a Repatriation Fund for their immigrant employees. Once the colonial government in Trinidad had been relieved of the liability of repatriating all their immigrant labourers in the event of an economic emergency, the officials’ concern subsided. So despite increasing evidence of an adequate labour supply and even unemployment, the request for regular numbers of immigrants was routinely approved. In 1909 the Sanderson Committee advised that there was no pressing need to terminate indentured immigration, or state assistance to it.[62]
 Indentured labour in Trinidad lasted, with little interruption, from 1845 to 1917, a period of nearly 80 years. It supplied the planters, chiefly the sugar estate proprietors with a ‘reliable’, disciplined workforce to replace their former slaves. State subsidies reduced the direct cost of imported labourers for the employers, and contract restrictions kept the indentureds under control. Thus the Indians’ and other servants’ importance lay less in their numbers than in their presence on the estate as a core work group, always at the employer’s command. Their availability enabled him to avoid the prevailing market prices for labour, and even to control the labour market.


-----

##### This position obtained both in periods of depression with consequent surplus labour supplies, and during expansionary periods with accompanying labour shortage in the agricultural industries. So despite varying economic circumstances, the planters demanded and secured a continued and increased supply of indentured recruits from India.
 The system of indentured labour had negative and far-reaching effects in cheapening agricultural labour, and degrading its status in Trinidad. As a result free labour, black and Indian, tended to quit the estates for superior alternatives in independent cultivation. The blacks increasingly shunned agriculture, leaving this sector to the Indians. These trends deepened the existing divisions between the ethnic groups, and perpetuated these divisions within the labour force.
 The economic power of the large sugar companies, and their financial bases in England ensured continuing influence on colonial policy. No less advantageous was their political position as British companies with a stake in the British colony of Trinidad. Despite the acknowledged unfavourable aspects of indentured labour, and the opposition to it in both Trinidad and in England, the colonial officials condoned the regular inflow of indentured servants as well as crucial state assistance. These policies arose from the apparent need to supply Trinidad with both population and more importantly, a servile, controllable labour force.

 FROM SLAVERY TO INDENTURE: FORCED LABOUR IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF MAURITIUS 1834-1867

 M.D. North-Coombes

##### The abolition of slavery in the British Empire severely set back the colonial sugar industry, mainly through its impact on labour supply. Of all Britain’s sugar-producing colonies, it was Mauritius which most successfully weathered the emancipation storm. This estate labour force was maintained and rapidly supplemented by the importation of indentured labour from India. This sustained a remarkable expansion in the sugar industry and secured for sugar plantations the dominance of the economic landscape. Until the 1880s these were organised much on the same lines as in the days of slavery. The continued adherence to sugar monoculture and to extreme forms of labour exploitation grossly distorted economic and social structure and processes, whilst severely limiting future development possibilities.
 This study will focus on the transition from slavery to indenture in the context of the Mauritian political economy and will examine this process and its broader significance. First, the crisis which beset the Mauritian sugar industry as a result of emancipation will be assessed. This will include a review of the strategy and means whereby this crisis was resolved and planter hegemony reasserted, between 1834 and 1842. The establishment of an indentured labour system, an elaborate edifice of increasing labour exploitation and control, constructed by colonial planting interests and the colonial state, in the quarter century after 1842, will then be outlined and interpreted. Particular attention will be paid to the way in which the colonial state was forced to assume many of the responsibilities, formerly the exclusive preserve of the planter class, as a result of the transition from slavery to indenture. How the modified role of the colonial state served the interests of both the metropolitan and colonial ruling classes will be examined briefly. This study, however, deals specifically with the internal dimensions of the Mauritian experience and thus its location within the world capitalist system is acknowledged, but not extensively examined.


-----

##### Finally, some of the implications of these developments for subsequent Mauritian history will be tentatively spelt out.
 British colonial slavery was abolished in terms of a law passed on 28 August 1833. The measure compromised between abolitionist sentiment and colonial property interests. The slaves were legally freed but in practice remained bonded to their former owners as apprentices for further terms of four to six years, in the case of non-praedial and of prae-dial slaves respectively. The slave-owners received an indemnity of £20 million and secured the services of their slaves during Apprenticeship in additional compensation. The Apprenticeship system, though partly designed to integrate slaves into free society by preparing them for freedom, functioned essentially to maintain economic and social stability in the slave colonies. It gave the colonial plantocracies a valuable breathing-space to adjust to the new conditions created by emancipation. Moreover, it meant that the slaves, rather than the British Exchequer, paid the bulk of compensation awarded to slaveowners.[1]
 Slave emancipation jolted the British colonial sugar industry, leading to a universal decline in sugar production, during the period of Apprenticeship and after. Yet, as the data in Table 4.1 indicates, emancipation did not affect Britain’s major sugar colonies uniformly. At one extreme stood Jamaica, where the sugar industry suffered permanent decline. In the other colonies, after a difficult period of readjustment, the expansion of the sugar industry was resumed. Recovery was painfully slow in British Guiana and was not yet complete by the late 1850s. In Barbados, recovery was more rapid but the subsequent expansion of the sugar industry was unimpressive. It was Mauritius, of all Britain’s sugar colonies, which weathered the threat of emancipation most successfully. Before 1834, Jamaica had produced twice as much and British Guiana seventy five per cent more sugar than Mauritius. Twenty years later, the latter island had become Britain’s premier sugar colony: its sugar production had increased to more than twice that of British Guiana’s and was nearly five times greater than that of Jamaica’s.

##### In Mauritius the slave-owners were, by and large, adequately compensated for the loss of their slaves. It was stipulated that compensation was only to be granted to persons with legal title to their slaves. Although some 5, 000 slaves were suspected to have been illegally detained into slavery on the island, the Slave Protector, R.M. Thomas, was unable to collect sufficient evidence for their liberation, in the face of planter opposition and the partiality of local courts.[2] Moreover, the validity of claims for compensation was subject to verification by a local Commission of Compensation. This body, overwhelmingly made up of persons with interests in the sugar industry, actively supported the colonists in the dispute, as ultimately did the British government, anxious to avoid social instability in the colonies and concerned with upholding property rights. Mauritian colonists were awarded a sum of £2, 112, 632 in compensation for 7, 386 claims, involving 66, 343 slaves, as its share of the total compensation fund of £20 million. However, not all Mauritian slaveowners benefited equally from the award of slave compensation. Small proprietors, lacking the funds or the know-how to validate their claims personally, were forced to rely on local attorneys, or on London merchants who opened ‘indemnity offices’ in the colony. These intermediaries and most large planters, received substantial sums; either in the form of commissions or in direct compensation for the loss of their slaves.


-----

##### The Mauritian plantocracy as a whole, therefore, did not suffer drastic property losses from emancipation Nevertheless, the sugar industry was severely affected by the labour ’ crisis’ which resulted, when the emancipees withdrew almost totally from plantation labour. When Apprenticeship was prematurely ended in March 1839, 13, 000 women labouring on sugar estates withdrew immediately from employment. Of the remaining 17, 000 male labourers, only 4, 000 could be persuaded to contract for an additional year of service. A spokesman for colonial merchants and planters warned at the time that ‘field labour is in my opinion ended forever amongst the emancipated negroes of Mauritius.’[3] This expectation was confirmed for, within less than a decade, as an occupational survey appended to the census of 1847 showed, there were only 189 ex-apprentices working as labourers on Mauritian sugar estates. The 30, 000 apprentices at work on plantations in 1839, had been replaced by 34, 401 Indian indentured workers.[4]
 This labour crisis has been explained, by most contemporary observers and by subsequent commentators, in terms of the former slaves’ unwillingness to remain field labourers after emancipation and of their ability to subsist, without recourse to wage employment on the plantations. These accounts, which ‘blamed’ the ex-apprentices for causing the labour crisis, are grossly misleading and need to be supplemented by paying attention to the role of the attitudes, expectations and activities of sugar planters and the imperatives of sugar production.[5]
 The sugar planters explained the unwillingness of the ex-apprentices to remain in plantation labour in overtly racist terms. Since the 1790s, when racism was first elaborated as the dominant ideology in Mauritius, slavery was defended as a necessary evil, on the grounds that blacks could not be induced to work voluntarily, even for high wages, because of their limited needs and their natural taste for idleness. Blacks were portrayed as ‘ignorant and vulgar beings ... for whom eating and drinking are the supreme happiness’. Nearly fifty years later, the same arguments were being put forward in opposition to emancipation. This is apparent in several accounts of the time, which are replete with examples of the indolence, dishonesty and ingratitude of the Mauritian ‘noir’.[6] One writer, for instance, assessed the probable impact of emancipation on the labour supply in the following terms. He asked:


-----

##### Is it reasonable to expect that, indolent as they are, childishly reckless of the future, and intoxicated with misty notions of their new found independence, they [the apprentices] will ... tranquilly and regularly resume as free labourers, the employments they had exercised in a state of bondage? ... By far the greater proportion of the apprentices on attaining emancipation will immediately withdraw their labour from the market and live unproductive ‘fain-cares’, till the whole of their earned or pilfered funds are consumed. Such an event, occurring during the sugar season, would be fatal to the planter.[7]

 As in former times, blacks were pictured by the colonists as having limited wants and as being totally unaware of the value of money. It was deduced from these assumptions, that an increase in wages could not raise the supply of labour, as claimed by Major E.C. Archer, in a letter to the Secretary of State, Lord John Russell, in 1840:

 It has been asserted that, the emanicpated blacks would willingly work were they offered fair and adequate wages. This is a popular and very mischievous fallacy ... But, in truth, the negro is ignorant in the true sense, of the real value of money; for his wants are too few to need much of it, and whether he gave double or quadruple the value of an article, which gratified his inclinations would not be the matter of a moment’s consideration.[8]

 Other observers denied that the ex-slaves’ refusal to labour voluntarily for their former masters was due to a ‘disposition to idleness’, to limited wants or to a lack of money consciousness. Instead, they more correctly blamed this refusal on the brutality of slavery and on the elements of compulsion built into the system of Apprenticeship. Thus, Reverend Patrick Beaton, who resided in Mauritius from 1851 to 1856, said of the ex-apprentices that:

 The remembrance of the horrors of slavery is engraven upon their memories with a pen of iron and no lapse of time will ever erase it. Labour in the fields will ever be regarded by them as a mark of degradation on account of the painful associations and memories which it awakens.[9]

##### There is, moreover, abundant evidence to show that the notions, that the emancipees had limited wants, or were ignorant of the ‘real value of money’, are untenable. During the period of Apprenticeship, compulsory labour was limited to forty five hours a week. Any additional labour required beyond this had to be rewarded in cash. The result was a spreading use of money amongst former slaves, and a widening of the market for consumer goods. For instance, the trader, James Blyth wrote to England in November 1835, that more French wines were required in the colony since ‘negroes being now too genteel to drink grog have cool claret instead.’ Two years later he commented that ‘artisans who formerly had eight to ten dollars a month now earn 25 to 30 dollars; and slave labourers now get one or two dollars instead of nothing.’[10] Many apprentices were, moreover, able to accumulate sufficient savings to purchase their own freedom before the formal termination of apprenticeship.
 The apprentices seem to have been acutely aware of the existence of labour scarcity and of the high price their labour could command on a free market. Evidence for this is provided by Edward Baker, a Quaker missionary who wrote that some slave-owners, capitalised on the tight labour market during the Apprenticeship period, by hiring out their apprentices at lucrative rates to the sugar planters. The slave-owners were paid six to eight dollars a month for the hire of each such labourer, but the latter’s actual remuneration was two dollars a month, which was equivalent to little more than the cost of their subsistence. Baker commented that:

 Now this state of things is clearly owing to the apprenticeship system, the surplus going to the owner, and not to the labourer. The blacks, however, naturally expect to get still higher wages on becoming free and hence arises the only real danger of their refusal to labour at all.[11]

 Major Archer, who pictured the enfranchised blacks as having limited wants, doubted that they possessed ‘the common attributes of civilised man’. However, Edward Baker stressed that the emancipees shared ‘the desire natural to every man of bettering his condition’. The emancipees deserted the plantations, not because they were irrational or inately lazy, as the colonists argued, but rather, because of the unattractiveness of estate labour on planters’ terms and because they were better able to make a living elsewhere.
 This ability depended, first and foremost, on the availability of unoccupied land. In the colonies such as Jamaica, British Guiana and Mauritius, where


-----

##### population density was low and unused arable land in plentiful supply, the freedmen and women were able to leave the estates to engage in peasant agriculture. In Barbados and Antigua, by contrast, where population density was high and arable land mostly in the control of sugar planters, there was no alternative to field labour and the supply of field workers, even at low rates of pay, was relatively plentiful. In Mauritius, some of the freed slaves were able to save enough money during Apprenticeship and thereafter, to purchase freehold plots. The occupational survey, an abstract of which is given in the Appendix, lists 2, 388 of these persons as independent proprietors in August 1846. Other freedmen were able to rent land from planters who, even before the end of Apprenticeship, divided their land into small tenements to be let out to the enfranchised ‘in some places from fifty dollars to three hundred dollars per acre.’[12] This subdivision of land may also have been motivated by the hope of securing an additional source of labour during the crop season, when extra hands were always needed. Liberated slaves, who were unable to purchase or rent land, became’squatters’ or illegal occupiers of private or Crown land. Many settled in peasant villages which mushroomed near the coast or alongside busy highways in the 1840s and 1850s.
 The free peasantry which emerged after emancipation, depended for its survival mainly on the cultivation of the soil and on the sale of surplus agricultural produce to the urban market of Port Louis. The peasants could also earn supplementary income in various activities, such as the weaving of sugar bags, mat-making, dress-making, laundering and carting. These occupations show that freedmen and women put to good use skills acquired on the plantations after emancipation. New occupations, unrelated to slavery, included hawking, petty-trading and tavern keeping. Many emancipees also earned additional income from fishing, although this activity is not adequately reflected in the occupational survey of 1846, which only lists 607 ex-apprentices as fishermen.
 The ability of the freed slaves to obtain alternative means of livelihood set the reserve price of plantation labour quite high. However, most planters refused to consider the possibility of raising wages and of improving working conditions to make estate labour more palatable to the liberated slaves, so as to retain their services. Instead, they followed a cheap labour strategy designed to secure an abundant supply of labour at low wages. To achieve this, the planters initially tried to hinder the formation of an independent black peasantry and to draft laws designed to force the


-----

##### emancipees on to the labour market. This policy was, however, de- emphasised as extraneous sources of plantation labour were successfully tapped in India - though it was to be revived in the 1850s and 1860s -to restrict the emergence of an Indian peasantry.
 The cheap labour strategy had important implications for sugar technology and labour productivity. Its outcome was a continued adherence to production techniques compatible with abundant supplies of cheap and tractable labour in agricultural activities, as in the days of slavery. An alternative strategy, favouring the payment of high wages to emancipees, on the other hand, would probably have necessitated the rationalisation of production methods and the adoption of labour-saving technology, to economise on the scarce factor. The likelihood of this assertion is supported by the experience of the British and French Caribbean sugar colonies, which encountered problems of labour scarcity after emancipation. Except where the plantation labour force was successfully reconstituted, as in British Guiana, sugar monoculture was also dethroned in such colonies, where agriculture became more diversified and where correspondingly greater opportunities became available to peasant producers.
 How can the adherence of the Mauritian planto-cracy to the cheap labour strategy be accounted for and to what influences can the success of this strategy, in consolidating planter hegemony and sugar monoculture, be attributed? Part of the explanation for the preference of Mauritian planters for traditional methods of labour utilisation and for their harsh treatment of labour, lies in the planters’ past. Since the 1790s, renewed abolitionist attempts at amelioration and emancipation provoked a near hysterical reaction on the part of the Mauritian plantocracy, which justified its reliance on slave labour and defended its property interests in virulently racist terms.[13] Racism reinforced coercive traits in the planters’ character and fostered an unwillingness to bargain with labourers. There was no room for the ‘coaxing’ of labour in planter psychology, as the earlier discussion of their interpretation of the labour problems facing them shows. Moreover, because of the success of their strategy, no pressures arose to force upon them the psychological re-orientation, which a transition from forced to ‘free’ labour required.
 If anything, such psychological adaptation was made more difficult by developments in the sugar industry during the apprenticeship period. Compensation payments and the greater liquidity which this created in the


-----

##### colony made possible increased investments in sugar plantations and the number of sugar mills rose from 167 in 1833 to 203 in 1838. The demand for labour created by this expansion was accentuated by the rising proportion of sugar factories converting to steam, the number of steam mills soaring upwards from 69 to 130 in the same period.[14] This expansion in crushing capacity and the increased capitalisation of sugar estates called for a corresponding increase in production and for an enlargement of the cultivated area, to make such investments worthwhile, but, this was done on the basis of traditional technology. No attempts were undertaken to introduce implementai agriculture, that would permit an extension of cultivation with reduced supplies of field labour. It is true that during Apprenticeship the labour force was still ‘captive’ and that the desire to minimise labour redundancy during the off-crop must have strengthened the attachment to traditional techniques. Moreover, early successes in recruiting Indian labourers up to 1839, may have convinced the planters that their labour problems would be shortlived.
 There were also practical difficulties which limited the planters’ ability to follow a high-wage high-productivity strategy. In the first place, the heavy weight of planter indebtedness and high costs of production, militated against the making of large profits, even in good years, and planters must have been unwilling to risk reducing these profits further by raising wages and by investing in untried improvements. Secondly, during Apprenticeship, capital was tied in new plantations and in sugar mills, so that funds for financing new methods of cultivation were probably limited. Circumstances prevailing in the market for British colonial sugar, where there was a persistent downward pressure on sugar prices, were also not of a nature to favour experimentation. Finally, the seasonal nature of sugar production and environmental constraints in Mauritius limited the opportunities for substituting capital for labour in field work.[15]
 The planters, in the knowledge that large areas of the island were still uncultivated and that abundant supplies of cheap labour could be secured abroad, were moreover unwilling to gear the expansion of the sugar industry to the pace of local population increase. Since the ending of the slave trade, the ‘ageing and wasting effect’ was no longer being offset by fresh importations and there was a temporary phase during which the slave and ex- slave population declined absolutely, from some 63, 000 in 1832 to 49, 365 in 1846. Many contemporary observers concluded from these facts that the


-----

##### island would never be able to raise an adequate labour force within its own territory. But by 1846, when the phase of absolute population decrease was at an end, there was near sexual balance in the fertile age-groups and the ex- apprentice population had gained a potential for natural increase, which it had formerly lacked.[16] Nevertheless, because of these difficulties, planters continued to adhere to traditional production methods and sought a supply of cheap labour by importing indentured immigrants from India on a large scale.
 From 1834 to 1839, 25, 468 Indian indentured labourers were introduced into the colony at a cost of nearly £280, 000. This substantial immigration was, in all likelihood, funded with compensation money or with loans raised on compensation claims. Much of the expense was eventually recouped from the labourers themselves by a combination of devices, which turned contract labour in Mauritius into a species of debt slavery.
 In 1839 the Governor-General of India, under the pressure of Indian public opinion, temporarily halted the traffic which threatened to degenerate into another slave trade. The Mauritian planters mounted a campaign for the resumption of immigration. They claimed that abuses could be prevented by adequate controls, that immigrants were generally well treated in Mauritius and that colonial living standards were far superior to those prevailing in the Indian sub-continent. The planters justified the colony’s need for an imported labour force by arguing, as previously discussed, that the freed slaves had deserted the plantations en masse to gratify a natural taste for idleness, that even the offer of high wages could not induce them to return to labour, and that the resulting labour shortage was threatening to ruin the colony. The Colonial Office responded favourably to these appeals and, early in 1842, Lord Stanley, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, authorised a resumption of immigration under government supervision.
 This victory for the Mauritian sugar-growers begs further elucidation. Mauritius was a conquered colony, inhabited by settlers of non-British stock, who enjoyed little or no political power and were often at loggerheads with the British officials appointed to govern them. The colonists, nevertheless, were able to promote their interests through unofficial bodies, which made their views heard to the authorities by means of numerous petitions and memoranda. In 1832 the colonists obtained an influential and permanent place in the administration, when they secured seven seats in a nominated Legislative Council of fourteen members. The composition of the Council


-----

##### was nearly always favourable to the plantocracy. Many official nominees on this body had become members of the colonial ‘establishment’ after a lengthy residence on the island, where they often married into local families and invested in sugar plantations. Council members were not united on every single issue but, when the health of the sugar industry and colonial prosperity were at stake, the divisive influence of language, culture and background were normally offset by the pull of common interests.
 Not only the attitude of local officials, but also the growing importance of the colony to Britain, helped to strengthen colonial demands for a resumption of Indian immigration. The island remained of great strategic importance to the metropole until the opening of the Suez canal in 1869. At the time of the conquest, a British naval officer voiced the opinion that this ‘warehouse of samples’ would prove, in a financial sense, ‘a deadweight ... a more than millstone round our necks.’[17] The correctness of this prediction was reflected in a massive deficit of £1, 645, 652 which accumulated in colonial accounts from 1811 to 1833.[18] With the rise of the sugar industry, funds were generated internally on a sufficient scale to defray the costs of colonial administration from the island’s own resources and the Colonial Office may well have feared the impact that a fall in sugar export earnings, as a result of the labour crisis, would have on the colonial budget.
 Mauritius also promised to develop into an important sugar supplier to the British market and, already by 1840, had become Britain’s first-ranking sugar colony. Moreover, even though most Mauritian resident planters were of French descent, British capitalists had invested considerable sums in Mauritian sugar estates, so that a close association had developed between local and metropolitan capital. British capitalists, in alliance with Franco- Mauritian planters, appointed British Members of Parliament as their political agents in London and formed pressure groups to lobby for the cause of the sugar industry with the Colonial Office.
 Finally, a factor of no mean importance in swaying the Colonial Office in the planters’ favour on the immigrants issue, was a convergence between the planters’ racist interpretations of the labour crisis and metropolitan perceptions of the respective rights and duties of masters and servants. Thus, in announcing the 1842 decision to resume immigration. Lord Stanley sought to justify it morally by appealing to beliefs that were compatible with planter prejudices. Stanley rejected the argument that Indian immigration would be harmful to the interests of the enfranchised population by limiting their


-----

##### opportunities for employment. In a statement, which snowed that he shared the planters’ interpretation of the labour shortage which followed emancipation, he said:

 ... when the slaves in our colonies were emancipated, they became subject to all the duties and to all the liabilities of the free members of a free state. Industry in their callings was one of those duties, and the penalties consequent on indolence and self indulgence were among those liabilities ... If a large portion of the people in any colony ... withdraw from those labours by which the community at large would be enriched and improved, they can have no reasonable ground of complaint if measures be taken by the Legislature to introduce other workmen who will undertake the duties which they decline.[19]

 This interpretation of the labour ‘crisis’ supported Stanley’s conclusion that ‘without the aid to be drawn from a foreign supply of labour, much of the fixed capital at present existing in the sugar colonies, and especially in Mauritius, will become comparatively useless.’ Not only was this unacceptable because of the property losses that it would entail, Stanley believed, but also because of ‘the still greater evil that the colony must retrograde in wealth and civilisation beyond the power of recovery, within any assignable period.’
 Thus the British government unhesitatingly placed the interests of the plantocracy above those of emancipated slaves in 1842. The indentured labour system, as it emerged in Mauritius, was a creation of the colonial ruling class of planters and merchants, assisted by the colonial state. What did the transition from slavery to this new system of labour utilisation signify in the context of the Mauritian political economy? In the days of slavery, the colonial state was little more than a representative of metropolitan interests. Often apparently at loggerheads with the colonists, its functions were limited to safeguarding those interests; by securing the island against foreign attack, collecting taxes and customs duties and enforcing commercial restrictions whilst, at the same time, interfering as little as possible in the closed world of the plantation. Slave plantations have been typified as ‘capitalist enterprises of a patriarchal and feudal character’.[20]
 Plantation production was pre-capitalist in its extensive use of land, in the low and stagnant levels of technology, in its reliance on slave labour and in the diversion of plantation profits to support the lavish aristocratic life-style


-----

##### of plantation owners. Yet planters were also capitalists, since they engaged in the large-scale speculative production of agricultural commodities for the world market. Though they lacked the compelling drive to accumulate demonstrated by industrial capitalists, they displayed a strong profit- orientation and a spirit of rational calculation as revealed in their often ruthless utilisation of slave labour. In Mauritius, these capitalist traits were reinforced by the emancipation of the slaves and their replacement by indentured wage labourers on the estates, as well as by the imperatives of production for an increasingly competitive world market which followed the removal of tariff protection for British colonial sugar producers in Britain and the spread of beet-root sugar manufacture on the continent.
 Slave plantation owners, in many ways like lords on their feudal domains, enjoyed arbitrary and extensive powers over their slaves. Under the French Code Noir and the English slave laws which superceded it, slaves were defined as chattels, having the legal status of moveable property and being subject to their masters’ will in an almost absolute sense. Slaves had no legal personality, beyond the dubious attribute of criminal responsibility and statutory protection against murder and the more extreme forms of torture. Abolitionist denunciations and ameliorative, measures, which were only tardily and imperfectly implemented in Mauritius, did little to reduce the enormous control which slave-owners exercised. This control rested ultimately on naked force and was displayed at all levels, ranging from the instruments of torture and the scaffold which awaited marroons or runaways, to the planter-controlled militia, acting as a deterrent against slave revolts, and to the overseer’s whip which dictated the rhythm of field-work.
 When slavery was abolished the legal status of plantation labourers changed. This placed new demands on the colonial state and forced it to assume new functions, as relations between slaveowners and their chattels, in the private realm of the plantation, were transferred to the public sphere where they now assumed the form of mutual duties and responsibilities between employers and employees, now nominally ‘free’. The role of the colonial state in the political economy of Mauritius was consequently both modified and expanded. This transformation, which was induced by abolition and reinforced by the large-scale importation of labourers from India, exhibited regulatory, ideological and repressive features. These three dimensions of the activities of the colonial state, in respect of Indian indentured immigration, will be examined in turn. A related sphere of state


-----

##### action, concerned with the emergence of an Indian peasantry outside the plantation sector, will then be discussed.
 The sugar economy of Mauritius after emancipation, as other capitalist systems of production, could not exist in the absence of the colonial state to guarantee the conditions for its maintenance and the reproduction of these conditions. The state was also required to arbitrate, on behalf of collective capital, between the conflicting interests of individual capitalists. In terms of external relations, it also had to mediate between conflicting colonial and metropolitan interests. On the whole, these interests tended to coincide, because of the close integration of the island in the peripheral circuit of the world economy and the dominance of the single export sugar, on which local fortunes were built and which tied colonial and metropolitan elites. So long as conditions for profitable sugar production could be maintained, in particular by assuring the availability of a cheap and docile labour force, the colonial state was able to play its mediating and reconciling role successfully.
 The major aim of state management of Indian immigration into Mauritius was to secure a cheap and abundant supply of labour for planters within a context circumscribed by the policies of the Colonial Office and the government of India. The wider significance of the location of Mauritius in the British imperial system, will not be treated in detail here, as the study will focus on internal developments in Mauritius.[21] After the resumption of large-scale immigration in 1842, the flow of Indian labour into the colony continued unabated, except for a temporary suspension in 1856 and 1857. In the quarter century after 1842, 340, 718 Indians were landed in Mauritius under the immigration scheme. Of these, 261, 074 were males and 79, 644 were females. Immigration was channelled through the three main ports of embarkation, of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. The first handled fifty eight per cent of the volume of immigration, the other two thirty three per cent and nine per cent respectively. Only 87, 617 immigrants returned to India at the end of their period of indenture, the balance remaining on the island, at work on the sugar estates or in the peasant and urban sectors of the economy. Women were more likely to stay in the colony than to return to India, given the fact that unlike men, they could not save from the fruits of their labour, to attain this goal. In addition, few women left families behind, either arriving alone or with their husbands. The proportion of departures in the total female population was sixteen per cent, while the corresponding figure for men was


-----

##### twenty nine per cent.[22] The pace of immigration fluctuated according to the state of the colonial demand for labour and in response to changing conditions in India. This demand for labour was normally buoyant, especially during the sugar boom of the 1850s. It rose sharply in 1843 and 1858 to 1859, following the removal of temporary bans on immigration imposed by the government of India. Colonial demand for immigrant labour was steeply reduced in times of depression for the sugar industry, as in 1847 to 1848, 1863 to 1864 and 1865 to 1871. Planters seem to have had little difficulty in procuring sufficient labour in India, despite their constant protestations to the contrary. What was generally an adequate supply/ however, became an embarrassing flood in times of famine and of political unrest in India. The high rate of immigration in 1858, for instance, was linked to:

 . . . the disturbed state of some of the provinces of India, and the high prices of food in India generally during the year (which) gave a strong impulse to emigration, and to that of a better class of men generally, many of whom arrived with their families.[23]

 The Mauritian’success’ in obtaining an adequate supply of labour for the sugar industry from India, was partially due to the island’s favourable geographical location in relation to India, situated as it was, in the south- western Indian Ocean. The island had long-standing mercantile connections with the Indian sub-continent datinq back to the eighteenth century and this facilitated labour recruitment and trade between the two economies. Transport costs between India and Mauritius were considerably lower and the voyaqe shorter than to the West Indies, giving an edge to the Mauritian planter over his Caribbean counterpart in the use of indentured labour. The proximity of Mauritius moreover, predisposed the Indian Government to treat the subject of Indian emigration to the colony as a special case. This attitude was evident at an early stage and shaped the policy of the government of India on the subject of emigration to Mauritius.
 The colonial government was crucially aware of the economic importance of Indian immigration which was described as the’sheet-anchor of colonial prosperity’. In the absence of an adequate supply of labour from internal sources, an official noted: ‘the system of immigration in all its branches becomes of paramount consideration and its operation ... demands the vigilant and increasing attention of the Government.’[24] It was recognised


-----

##### that, in times of increased competition on the world market, the state had a special duty to help maintain the profitability of sugar cultivation and manufacture. There was, moreover,

 ... [an] obligation imposed upon the government, both imperial and local, to support to the utmost of its ability at this crisis, the struggling sugar- grower, by having recourse to every legitimate means within its competency to aid the efforts now making to diminish the cost of production; for in this after all lies the solution of the problem.[25]

 To meet this end, the colonial state took steps to guarantee an uninterrupted and sufficient inflow of labour from abroad. To ensure that this labour would be not only abundant but also cheap, the state interfered on behalf of the planters in the labour market. This took the form of a gradual dismantling of the protective measures adopted against abuses in the recruitment and employment of indentured workers.
 On resumption of Indian immigration under government control in 1842, labourers had a certain freedom to choose their employers and to take advantage of the state of the colonial labour market. Contracts of service negotiated outside the colony were invalid, and could not be concluded until immigrants had been in the colony for at least forty eight hours. Moreover, engagements were limited to periods of up to one year, which gave labourers an opportunity to seek better conditions of employment after twelve months on the island. Neither the planters nor the colonial authorities were satisfied with this arrangement. The short terms of indenture were criticised for creating problems of labour discipline, for generating a high rate of labour turnover and for their impact on wages. These were bidded upwards by the fierce competition between sugar-growers to re-engage workers as their annual contracts expired.
 Officials did their best, using legal and extralegal methods, to pressure labourers into continuous employment and to force them to accept low wages. It was expected that new immigrants would remain employed, preferably in agriculture, during a five year period of ‘industrial residence’, in order to repay the costs of their introduction. Various devices, such as a tax of £2.18s per annum, on under contract, were used to pressure them to re- engage. In the absence of legislation to regulate wages, those in authority used the influence of office to persuade workers to refrain from making exorbitant demands on their employers. In 1852, for example, when the


-----

##### sugar market was depressed and it became essential to cut production costs by reducing wages, the island’s Colonial Secretary informed the stipendiary magistrates before whom contracts of indenture were drawn, of the governor’s conviction

 ... that the mitigation of the present evil may be effected, though not by legal ordinances, yet by moral influences ... You cannot prevent planters from paying high wages, if they wish to do so; neither can you prevent labourers from receiving high wages, if their capacity or experience is such as to command them; but, in his Excellency’s opinion, you can dissuade planters from entering into a dishonest competition in making promises which they never intend to fulfil, and labourers from making exorbitant demands which they cannot reasonably expect to have satisfied ... You can explain to the immigrant, on entering into a new engagement, that the price of sugar does not admit of his being paid the high wages which he formerly received; and that, if he receives them for a time, it is impossible that he can continue to receive them much longer.[26]

 In any case, labourers seldom received the rate of wages at which they were hired. Employers used a host of devices to retain a portion of workers’ earnings. It was common practice to deduct a sum from monthly wages to refund money advances made to the labourers in India and as a security against misconduct. There is little evidence that the planters heeded the Colonial Office’s objections to these methods. Wages could be reduced below the agreed levels by means of the ‘double cut’. In terms of this notorious practice, the value of two days labour was retained by the planter in compensation for every day of absenteeism from work, for whatever cause, by the worker. Wages were, moreover, often in arrears. Whenever planters needed liquid funds or fell on hard times, the payment of wages was dispensed with when they became due. Although redress against this breach of contract was available, legal processes were notoriously slow and the courts proverbially partial to the masters. Workers theoretically held a first lien for unpaid wages on the proceeds of bankrupt estates, in precedence over other creditors, but this right was seldom exercised. They were tied to the bankrupt plantation, at first in practice and later in terms of the labour laws, and were forced to depend on the goodwill of their new masters, for compensation. Governor Barkly recounted approvingly in 1865, a time of agricultural distress, that on estates under sequestration:


-----

##### ... in no case, I am happy to say, was the slightest ill-feeling exhibited the immigrants on the whole behaving admirably, sometimes accepting lower wages, at others begging permission merely to remain on the estate and occupy their houses though unemployed. It is within my knowledge that, in a district not very distant from my residence, more than 1, 200 men thus quietly awaited the commencement of the new crop, and the return of better times.[27]

 A major legislative victory for the planters was won in 1849 when three year contracts were authorised. This contributed to a sharp drop in labour circulation and to a lowering of wages, as noted subsequently in an official report:

 There were thus 10, 000 Discharges less in 1851 than in any previous year, and 15, 000 less in 1853. This change was owing entirely to the Triennial Engagement. The convenience which the planters must have experienced from it, by being relieved from the necessity of seeking fresh hands, and from demands for higher wages, cannot be over estimated.[28]

 Government interference in the labour market and control of labour importation called for central authority to play a distributive role, allocating the available labour supply amongst competing users. As from 1844, although the private introduction of immigrants under government supervision was permitted, it became rapidly superceded by the direct introduction of labour by the colonial government. The latter repeatedly pledged ‘to ensure an equitable distribution of immigrants amongst all requiring their services’.[29] Requisitions were accepted from planters for labourers, and immigration quotas assigned to them in proportion to their importance as sugar-growers. Since actual labour requirements frequently and unpredictably differed from those estimated, employers were allowed to recruit additional labourers in India, by paying for the full cost of their introduction themselves. This privilege, extended in 1855, put the spotlight on an aspect of the immigration laws which declared contracts drawn up in India, not to be binding in Mauritius. This safeguard was denounced for creating opportunities for the sirdars and ‘old immigrants’, acting as recruiters, to tempt immigrants so introduced, to sign contracts with other employers on their arrival in Mauritius. This keen competition for immigrants discouraged private immigration and forced wages upwards.


-----

##### High wages, however, did not benefit the immigrants, the planters argued, but the crimps and labour touts who by various subterfuges, endeavoured to ‘get and maintain a hold over the men and induce them to accept service with those whose necessities compel them to offer to themselves the highest bribe.’[30]
 It was essential from the planter-official point of view, to insulate labourers from the ‘unsettling and deceptive influence of the crimp’, to encourage amongst them ‘more settled and industrious habits’ and to bring wages down to more acceptable levels. To achieve these aims, incessant calls were made, in correspondence with the Colonial Office, by individual planters, the Chambers of Agriculture and Commerce of Mauritius and by officials in the colony. Essentially, they demanded that contracts drawn up in India be recognised as valid and that the length of contract be extended from three to five years. These concessions were eventually granted in 1858 and 1862 respectively, while the government undertook the task of ‘a liberal introduction of immigrants for general allotment’.[31] Far from putting an end to fraudulent practices in the recruitment of indentured labour though, the new legislation probably gave these impetus. It denied immigrants the opportunity of taking cognisance, at first hand, of the conditions prevailing in the colonial labour market, or of selecting their employer. Moreover, it made it more difficult for workers to change their employers in protest against low wages, unacceptable conditions or misrepresentation. As for Mauritian planters, from 1862, they had access to a captive labour force of ‘new immigrants’ engaged at low wages and bound to serve them for up to five years. This bonded labour force could, moreover, be easily supplemented with workers drawn from the ‘old immigrants’ who had become permanently settled in the colony, outside the plantation sector.
 Ordinance No.16 of 1862, which authorised five year contracts, was welcomed by the proprietors who expected that it would instill ‘habits of greater steadiness’ in the Indian population. A similar hope may have motivated a provision in this measure for the engagement of female immigrants for work on the sugar estates. Hitherto, Indian women had been imported mainly to comply with the requirements of immigration regulations which stipulated a fixed proportion of female to male immigrants. The main purpose behind female immigration was to redress to some extent, the sexual imbalance in the immigrant population and to mitigate ‘the formidable evils inseparable from the great disparity of the sexes’.[32] Their presence was seen


-----

##### as a necessity in purely functional terms by the colonists, who characterised Indian women as ‘leading lives of idleness and prostitution’. This picture is at variance with the evidence of those Indian women arriving in Mauritius with their husbands. Further, a not inconsiderable number of women, travelling alone, were known to have joined their friends and relatives who had preceded them in the colony on arrival. It was mainly as a result of the colonists’ attitudes and actions, through the policy of an essentially male immigration, the refusal to recognise marriages contracted in India in the colony, and the sexual expolitation of Indian women by planters, overseers and sirdars, that Indian womanhood came to be seen as inherently immoral, and Indian women as leading a degraded existence in Mauritius. The employment of female immigrants under contract, after 1862, far from serving the moralistic purpose of instilling in them ‘habits of industry’, may have been designed instead, to reinforce the effects of five year contracts, to stabilise the captive core of the labour force by attracting males to estate labour on a more committed and permanent basis. Indian women, in this new capacity, were now conceived of in official mythology, as ‘wives and mothers’ who would only serve at ‘the lighter kinds of labour for which they may be fitted’. The potential for utilising Indian women, whose numbers were then increasing rapidly, in economic activities or for the purpose of labour force stabilisation on the plantations, was not however immediately exploited. It was not until the inter-war years of the next century, that Indian women came to be employed on a large scale on the sugar estates. As late as 1898, according to the official statistics, fewer than 3, 000 of them were engaged in agricultural occupations. In the meantime, over 100, 000 women living in rural areas were classified in the ‘indefinite’ and ‘non-productive’ category.[33]
 The colonial state regulated not only the recruitment, importation, allocation and employment of labour, but it was also responsible for the financing of immigration. Part of the cost of introducing labourers at public expense was recovered directly from the planters to whom labourers were allocated, the balance being drawn from the general revenue. It is misleading to focus narrowly on the financing of immigration as a service which paid for itself, for it must be seen in the context of public taxation and expenditure in Mauritius. This was designed to favour the planter and to penalise the labourer. The incidence of taxation was highly regressive. The sugar industry was favoured by ‘the exemption of land from taxation, except in the shape of


-----

##### a light export duty.’[34] When public finances were healthy, fiscal concessions were readily extended to sugar-growers. Hence, in 1851, the duty on sugar was reduced from nine and a half pence to four and a half pence per 100 pounds and registration dues and charges on the transfer of real property lowered by one quarter. From 1851 to 1855, Governor Higginson boasted that taxes had been repealed ‘to the amount of £55, 800 per annum’.[35] While tax relief was granted to the planters, the burden of taxation was carried by the poorer consuming groups in the colony. Thus between 1843 and 1851, indemnities paid to private introducers of immigrants from public funds, were financed by a duty on the sale of colonial rum. In the latter year, the reduction in export duty on sugar was partly offset by increasing the duty on rum from three shillings to five shillings per gallon. Locally produced spirits were marketed mainly internally and Indian labourers on the sugar estates were amongst its major consumers. Until the 1870s, grog-shops attached to the estates sold rum and other commodities to labourers at inflated prices, encouraging purchases on credit and absorbing much of labour’s income.
 Planters were exempt, along with professional men and public functionaries, from taking out the heavy licences which were imposed on practically every occupation of the poor, as Governor Arthur Gordon critically remarked in 1871. In areas of social concern, where private funding was the norm, Indians were made to shoulder more than their fair share. In 1865 for instance, it was recommended that indentured labourers be made to contribute to the Poor Rates. In effect, to support non-Indian paupers, as indigent Indians were not allowed to remain in the colony but were sent back to India at public expense.
 Public revenue, thus deriving in large measure from the taxation of Indian immigrants, was expended lavishly on schemes calculated to bolster the sugar industry. Large sums were spent on the importation, management and repression of the labour force. An internal transportation system, made up of good, well-maintained roads and including an expensive trans-island railway, costinq over £1 million was constructed. This was done in order to open up the inaccessible areas of the interior to suqar-cane cultivation and to facilitate the speedy transportation and marketinq of sugar.
 By contrast with the largesse extended to the sugar industry, paltry sums were spent on the provision of social services for the population as a whole. Planters wanted cheap government and opposed any schemes of public spending which did not directly benefit them. Ida Pfeiffer remarked in 1865,


-----

##### that the Mauritian Qovernment was’saving and avaricious’ and was ‘much more stingy with its well-filled chest, than our European states that are burdened with debt’.[36]
 The colonial budget was in the black for most years from 1842 to 1860, when a surplus of revenue over expenditure amounting to £304, 735 accumulated in the public treasury. None of these public funds were used, except in pitiable amounts, to improve the quality of life for Indian immigrants in Mauritius. This neglect was particularly evident in the fields of health and education which we must consider next, in the light of the ideological role of the colonial state.
 Repressive measures alone could not secure the stability of the brutal system which existed in Mauritius, especially when the oppressors were so greatly outnumbered by the oppressed. The continuation of planter hegemony thus depended also on the existence of an forceful ideology of domination. To be effective, such an ideology had to instill in the rulers a psychological readiness to claim and exercise authority unquestioningly. It also needed to convince the oppressed that not even a revolution could upset the permanence of the existing order. Moreover, it had to show that the ruled were so inferior to the rulers, that they could not conceivably aspire to the latter’s status and privileges. Hence, this legitimising ideology had to act, first and foremost, as a cement for internal social cohesion and stability. It also had to serve as á defence against external attacks on the existing system.
 In Mauritius, it was racism which was used, very successfully, to provide for the preservation of the status quo. Racism as an ideology of legitimation, was first clearly articulated in the 1790s and again, from the 1820s onwards, when the institution of slavery came under fire from metropolitan abolitionism. The earlier, more paternalistic justifications of slavery were found wanting, and a virulently racist defence of that institution had to be constructed.[37] The pervasive force of racism as a doctrine of colonial dominance, can be seen in Mauritius, as a nascent form of the pseudo- scientific Social Darwinism which provided the rationale for later imperialist ventures and which allowed these to be portrayed as ‘civilising missions’. Racism and its visible corollary, racial discrimination, was not rendered obsolete by emancipation. Instead, it was further elaborated and refined to legitimise continued planter domination of society, and the ruthless exploitation of Indian indentured labour. When planters, for a brief time in the late eighteenth century, exercised direct political power through the


-----

##### medium of the Colonial Assembly, which they controlled in defiance of metropolitan France, the various components of the colonial state were used as a means of ideologically consolidating their hegemony. The colonial state continued to perform this important task after emancipation, by shaping social consciousness to elicit support for, and to discourage dissent in, the existing social order.
 Mauritian racism focused its attention on degrees of ‘whiteness’ rather than on any simple distinction between black and white. Given the demographic realities and the long history of miscegenation on the island, the concept of whiteness in any absolute sense is a ridiculous myth. However, this myth of racial purity has been assiduously propagated through the generations, while simultaneously being associated with economic dominance, by Franco-Mauritian planters and their descendants. For example, during a lecture on Mauritius delivered at the Royal Colonial Institute in London, in April 1882, H.J. Jourdain acknowledged somewhat paradoxically, the racial heterogeneity of the population, whilst at the same time reaffirming that the small ruling class was racially pure. Jourdain claimed that after nearly two hundred years, there were still six to seven thousand inhabitants of pure French and English stock on the island. At this time, the total population numbered 360, 000.[38]
 In spite of the resilience of the myth of ‘whiteness’ in racially-mixed Mauritian society, it was not possible to construct a rigid racial order on ‘apartheid’ lines. Though extensive racial discrimination was no less real, racism assumed a more subtle form, especially in its typification and treatment of Mauritian-born blacks. Indian immigrants were ostensibly the most alien element in society and were crudely stereotyped and relegated to the lower reaches of the scale of social worth, according to a number of imputed racial characteristics. This process of stereotyping underpinned the panoply of racially discriminatory policies and practices to which Indians in general, and indentured labourers in particular, were subject. Thus, this discrimination appeared at one and the same time both practically necessary and morally justified.
 The typifications of Indians as unclean and ignorant beings, as semi- barbarous heathens who were naturally prone to crime, provided a justification for extreme policies of control and social neglect. Incongruously, these traits were frequently made manifest by the policies themselves. For example, Indians could hardly have appeared clean given


-----

##### the sordid conditions under which they were made to live. On the sugar estates, Indians inhabited filthy and over-crowded camps. Their huts were poorly constructed: ‘the eases low and narrow having more the aspect of pigsties than of human habitations.’[39] As shelters they provided no protection against the cyclonic gales which struck the island in the summer months. During the cyclone of March 1868, ’scarcely a dependency or malabar hut in the various camps was left standing.’[40] Eighty nine people were killed and 20, 188 huts blown down or carried away by the storm. Only 1, 306 of the more substantial wooden houses suffered the same fate. Indian camps were situated in unhealthy positions. On Forbach Estate, as on many other plantations, manure heaps, in which all animals dying on the estate were buried, were located close to and on the windward side of the camps. The water supply was generally defective. Camp dwellers had to resort to polluted rivers and canals, into which the effluent of sugar-mills was disgorged, for washing and drinking purposes. In this squalid environment, epidemic disease thrived. There were, however, few facilities for the medical treatment of the sick. Whilst planters claimed to have built hospitals and dispensaries on their estates, the reality was quite different. An Officer of the Civil Status testified in 1872 that:

 Most of the persons attending before me to make declarations of death are generally too poor to afford the expense of obtaining a certificate of the cause of death, and the sick are generally unprovided during illness with the assistance of a medical man.[41]

 The sanitary problems of the rural districts were replicated on a larger scale in the town of Port Louis, where an apathetic municipal corporation proved unwilling to cater for the needs of a rapidly increasing urban population. The colonists blamed Indian immigration for the introduction of epidemic diseases and the ‘uncleanly habits’ of the resident Indian population for the high mortality suffered during these outbreaks. To counteract the danger, harsh quarantine regulations were imposed on immigrant ships, whose passengers were isolated for lengthy periods on barren Flat Island, under appalling conditions, without adequate shelter, provisions, water supply or medical assistance. This inhumane policy was ineffective. It failed to halt the spread of epidemics which only a concerted drive for providing drainage and sewerage facilities, improving the water supply and enforcing health regulations could have halted. After the severe


-----

##### malaria epidemic of 1866, there was a large migration of the well-to-do from the over-crowded and unhealthy town of Port Louis, to the more salubrious inland districts. Thus emerged a pattern of residential segregation between the poor ’ black’ population of the capital and the affluent blanas of Cure- pipe and Vacoas which has endured to this day.
 Above all, Indians were seen by planters and officials, as ignorant, semi- barbarous beings, naturally suited to and fit for little else but arduous field labour. This characterisation was inconsistent with earlier pre-emancipation portrayals of Indians as ideal domestic servants, renowned for their cleanliness and as skilful workmen whose inferior physique ruled them out as field hands. Throughout Mauritian history, one can find racial divisions of labour, whereby certain racial groups were prominent in particular occupations. Appropriate stereotypes were always conveniently manufactured to justify the racially hierarchical employment options prevailing at any one time.
 The education policies pursued by the colonial state gave effect to the notion that Indians were only fit for unskilled labour. Indeed, one of the most strategic areas of ideological conditioning for the colonial state, lay in this sphere. Elementary education fell under almost complete government control after 1856, when private ecclesiastical schools became eligible for financial assistance and came under government supervision as grant-in-aid schools. Four years before, no provision had yet been made for the education of Indian children on the grounds that they were ‘transient soujourners’. Thus this neglect of the Indians’ education led to an apparent confirmation of the notion that they demonstrated an inherent incapacity to rise above the level of unskilled manual work. The Council of Government, however, in 1852, made available the paltry sum of £96 for the setting up of an experimental Indian school at Savanne, attended by some twenty pupils. Subsequently, Indian education made some progress. A section of the colonial elite feared that it was dangerous to have a large, ignorant and undisciplined element in the population, ‘unconnected by the ties of early habits with the people among whom they are destined to live’ and resolved to extend the scope of Indian education in order to mould Indian children into ‘docile and useful subjects’.[42] The spread of Indian education, however, was exceedingly slow. By 1865 no more than twelve hundred Indian children out of a total Indian community of nearly 234, 000 were at school. This compares with nearly six thousand pupils from the rest of the population of some 107, 000.


-----

##### Most Indian children living on sugar estates in the rural areas received no schooling at all, but instead, spent their days labouring in groups of twenty to thirty, ‘cleaning the cane fields of weeds and preparing for the in-gathering of the staple produce of the colony’. This lack of schooling was blamed, incorrectly by contemporaries, on the apathy of Indian parents. At least, this was the view of Bishop Ryan, who was in charge of ten protestant grant-in- aid schools for Indians. He observed that ‘the parents, if left to themselves, are by no means indisposed to let their children be uneducated.’[43] Ryan and other protestant missionaries received little encouragement from planters in establishing schools on sugar estates for the education of the children of their Indian labourers. Planters were generally affiliated to the Roman Catholic church, and the latter showed no disposition to improve the conditions of the Indian labouring population. This was noted in 1859 by the Superintendent of Schools, R. Hussey Walsh who wrote:

 Hitherto I am not aware of any efforts having been made on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church for the instruction of the Indians. None of their clergy in Mauritius I am informed, are acquainted with any of the Indian languages and even if they were the demands upon their time by their numerous congregations would prevent them from attending to other matters.[44]

 Planter neglect of Indian education was tied up with a widespread colonial prejudice against the education of the poorer classes generally, as this was seen to be potentially harmful to the labour-intensive agricultural structure. Education created expectations as well as opportunities for gaining entry into urban occupations for men ‘whose arms and sinews might be more usefully and profitably employed in the cultivation of the soil and the ruder mechanical arts.’[45] It was feared that education would reinforce the attitudes of aversion to field labour, prevailing amongst ex-apprentices since the time of slavery, and which, in influencing Indian immigrants, could make a large section of the population ‘useless for all purposes of labour’. Such considerations became more important as the resident Indian population grew, for it became feasible to recruit plantation labour internally from their ranks. In addition, this colonial prejudice dictated a highly uneven distribution of educational facilities in Mauritius between town and country districts. Schools were highly concentrated in the town of Port Louis and the adjacent districts of Pamplemousses and Plaine Wilhelms (twenty six schools


-----

##### in 1859), whilst the remaining rural districts had very few schools in spite of their considerably large populations (ten schools in 1859).
 Not only the quantity but also the quality of educational facilities available to Indian children left much to be desired. Indian teachers were poorly qualified and badly remunerated. Masters at the thirty Indian schools which existed in 1865 were paid an average salary of £45 per annum, compared to one of £165 per annum for masters in the other forty seven colonial schools. Indian children, who were taught in three vernacular dialects, Tamil, Bengali and Hindi, as well as in English and French, could absorb little but the most rudimentary knowledge. The ideological significance of the inferior type of education received by Indians in Mauritius is most clearly shown in the syllabus of the Indian Reformatory School. This institution, created in 1860 to restore ‘vagrant’ children to society, ‘as respectable members, able and willing to earn an honest livelihood’ provided a practical as well as a moral training programme. Under the first, languages, arithmetic and various trades were taught. Under the second, Indian children were exposed to:

 ... the first principles of religion, the moral obligation of servants towards their masters, and those portions of the law relating to servants and masters, and of the criminal code with which it would be most useful for them to be acquainted.[46]

 This speaks for itself. Clearly, the kind and amount of education available to the children of Indian immigrants in Mauritius had the effect of keeping them among the ranks of labourers and of reinforcing the traits of subordination and docility, aimed at and achieved by the repressive apparatus of the colonial state.
 Indians were generally said to be ‘from the lowest and most ignorant classes of their countrymen who at present appear to be beyond the reach of the civilising and humanising influences of religion and education.’[47] This perception of Indians as’semi-barbarous’ heathens, unrestrained by morality, engendered beliefs that they were especially prone to crime and dictated a stronger reliance on repressive measures than would otherwise conceivably have been the case to maintain social peace. The repressive arm of the colonial state had already been strengthened to cope with the consequences of emancipation. An enlarged police force replaced the planter militia, disbanded in 1829 and the colonial judiciary was saddled with new


-----

##### responsibilities. This was because emancipation ‘rendered amenable to justice a large number of persons whose petty offences were previously punishable by their employers, domestic authority have (sic) been found sufficient’.[48]
 On-going immigration after 1842 placed great strains on the existing repressive apparatus which had to be re-organised and extended. This was particularly evident in the case of prison facilities. In 1850, the Port Louis jail, which had been designed to accommodate only 283 inmates, was filled to over-crowding with 649 prisoners. In view of the assumed criminal tendencies of the Indian population, prison discipline was made more severe, even though, as the Prison Committee remarked, the prison was then ‘by no means an attractive or agreeable residence’. Whipping, proscribed under the Prison Regulations Ordinance, No.5 of 1835, was reintroduced and steps were taken to reduce the prison diet which was considered ‘unnecessarily generous and costly’. It was planned to cut down on the ‘too expensive and perhaps superfluous articles of fresh meat and tripe’ thereby leaving prisoners with a protein deficient diet, of bread, rice, salt and vegetables. To expedite the course of justice in the rural areas, and to relieve pressure on the town jail, it was decided to build new magistrate’s courts and prisons in the country districts. Four years after their completion, these were said to have benefited the sugar planters as well as the Indian rural population who became to the magistrates, the ‘principal clients ... in their character of agricultural labourers and domestic servants’.[49]
 In adjudication of disputes between masters and servants, the colonial judiciary was predisposed to favour the masters. This partiality is borne out by the observations of travellers, such as Ida Pfeiffer’s remarks on ‘planters’ law’, and in official records. In the early days of Indian immigration, many complaints of brutality and mistreatment were lodged by indentured labourers against their masters who, in the words of a contemporary governor, were’still mourning over the loss of their slaves’. Charges of assault were particularly numerous. Labourers also complained of being confined in stocks, locked up in estate hospitals without food or medical attendance for several days, being forced to work long hours on Sundays, being denied sufficient food, clothing or shelter, and of deductions or non- payment of their wages. Despite this, it was practically impossible for Indians to seek redress under the law which was ostensibly impartial. By illustration, of the 385 such cases brought before stipendiary magistrates


-----

##### between January and September 1840, 156 were dismissed or sent to other courts, thirty three were withdrawn and thirteen (including one case involving forty labourers) led to punishment for bringing false or frivolous accusations against their masters. Convictions were only obtained in 183 of the cases, with most of the convicted masters or overseers being let off lightly with low fines or simple reprimands.[50] When existing legislation could not be invoked to protect workers in labour conflicts, magistrates readily used their influence to persuade or cajole them to act in conformity with the interests of their employers.
 To understand properly the repression of Indian labour in Mauritius one must locate it within the context of continuous and wide-ranging conflict waged between indentured workers and their employers. Labour resistance to misrepresentation, low wages, harsh working and living conditions, mistreatment and injustice was seldom overt. There is some evidence, however, of labourers occasionally combining to oppose violent or unjust employers with violence. For example, in 1865, thirteen members of a plantation gang killed their’strict but apparently not unjust master’ who was supervising their labour in the fields. It was officially claimed that the murder had been prompted ‘by jealousy or other kindred feelings in regard to women’.[51] Given the prevailing conventional wisdom, this interpretation would have been readily acceptable to public opinion. Four of the group were sentenced to death by the court, ‘it being expedient to make a severe example in such a case’. Other murders of planters by their labourers have been recorded, as in the case of L. Ganachaud in September 1866. Indians also on occasions attacked those in and representative of authority. In 1855 for instance a group of twenty one Indians badly beat up two policemen who had attempted to arrest them. With regard to sanctions, public opinion, the colonial press and judiciary brutally agitated for a reinstatement of the guillotine which had been abandoned in 1851 for Indian criminals. It was argued that, given the fatalistic religious beliefs of the latter, decapitation was preferable to hanging as a more effective deterrent.
 In the repressive environment of Mauritius the ultimate act of protest by violent means was the taking of one’s own life. Suicide was a common form of escape from the brutal yoke of slavery as various contemporary accounts testify. It was similarly noticed to be widespread in the ranks of the Indian labouring population after emancipation. Police statistical returns told an alarming tale of futile and final protest against private abuse and social


-----

##### neglect. For instance, in the six years after 1860, known and suspected incidents of suicide were thirteen times more numerous amongst Indians who formed sixty eight per cent of the total population than in the rest of the community. The probable motives listed by the Police Superintendent were revenge and jealousy (111 cases), poverty and sickness (150 cases) and a surprisingly large number from unknown causes (170 cases).[52]
 On the whole, however, labour resistance took either a passive or covert rather than a violent form. Moreover, worker consciousness was not highly developed and individual resistance was more common than organised mass protests. This is not to say that groups of labourers did not combine to express common grievances and to oppose and seek redress from their employers. But such combinations were short-lived, infrequent and tended to be formed along ethnic lines. Thus, in 1840, when forty labourers from Madras on the Gondveville Estate, took a collective stand against their master who had mistreated them, the latter was supported by other workers originating from Calcutta. The colonial state encouraged these divisive tendencies and helped to fragment the work force by, for example, recruiting policemen mainly from the minority Tamil-speaking group and by denying new immigrants the right to the few privileges enjoyed by ‘old immigrants’. When labourers expected a sympathetic hearing, however, they were likely to desert the estates wholesale to lay complaints against their employers before the colonial governor or before stipendiary magistrates reputed to have been anti-planter, as occurred repeatedly in 1840. Labour action on a collective basis could also be expected to occur, when labourers experienced an abrupt change in circumstances, which affected them equally. It was reported that estate labourers sometimes went on strike, when the plantations on which they worked were sold, usually as a result of bankruptcy, in protest against non-payment of wages or the ‘peculiar discipline of a new employer’, which might ensue. This refusal to work or insubordination was seen in a more serious light than desertion or absenteeism, and was severely suppressed by the courts.
 The most widespread form of expressing dissatisfaction with the plantation regime was through voluntary withdrawals from labour, for periods ranging from short terms of absenteeism to permanent desertion. Desertion and its corollary, vagrancy, were fiercely resented by planters and officials, for disrupting the economic activity of the estates; for the unsettling effect it had on the estate labour force and for being a supposed source of


-----

##### much crime on the island. Officials charged with repressing vagrancy failed to see it as a deliberate and often legitimate form of protest by labourers against the abuses perpetrated by their employers. Instead, they ascribed it to the ‘idle and unsettled habits’ and to the ‘erratic character’ of the Indians, as well as to their ignorance, arguing that it would decrease in intensity ‘as the relations between masters and servants are becoming better understood’.
 This form of protest was very widespread as indicated by the number of arrests for vagrancy and desertion which reached nearly 9, 000 in 1855 to 1856 or, 12 per cent of the estate labour force of 73, 000.[53] To deal with ‘this monster evil’, as Major-General CM. Hay called it, the police force was reorganised and a new force of Indian constables was created specifically to detect and apprehend deserters, whilst police stations were also erected in country districts. Indian labourers under engagement had no freedom of movement and had to produce, on demand, passes from their masters.
 The ‘old immigrants’, who had completed five years of ‘industrial residence’ in the colony and consequently were under no theoretical obligation to contract for employment, had to carry valid ‘tickets of discharge’ without which they could be detained as deserters. Would-be deserters found it imperative to obtain false papers to escape detection and victimisation by the police. To stamp out the forgery of documents, which seems to have been widespread in the early 1860s, photographs were attached to tickets. Moreover, increasingly irksome restrictions were placed on the movement of old immigrants in violation of their rights as free British subjects. In terms of Ordinance 31 of the 1867 labour code, they were obliged to obtain police passes within eight days of their discharge from a contract of service. Police passes were only issued to immigrants with satisfactory abodes or occupations. Those with ‘no fixed residence or bona fide occupation, employment or means of subsistence’, or whose occupation was ‘not such as to justify the issue of a pass’ were declared to be vagrants and dealt with accordingly. Immigrants entitled to police passes could not change their domicile from one district to another without obtaining new passes. The inconvenience of this requirement must have been great in tiny Mauritius, with an area of barely 1, 800 square kilometres, divided into no less than nine districts.
 The suppression of desertion and vagrancy served the dual purpose of maintaining work discipline on the sugar estates and of limiting the employment opportunities available to Indian immigrants outside the


-----

##### plantation sector. The method of dealing with deserters and vagrants was altered when found to run counter to the first aim of disciplining the labour force. During the 1850s Indians arrested for such offences were placed along with other criminals in the island’s prisons. It was feared that close contact with hardened criminals during internment, would lead to the spread of ‘moral pestilence’ among the Indian labour force and that, moreover, ordinary prison life was not a sufficient deterrent, despite engagement in hard labour.
 Major Anson, the Inspector-General of Police, recommended the establishment of a separate Vagrant Depot as an alternative. He wrote that under existing prison regulations, a vagrant:

 ... is called on to work fewer hours and finds himself better fed, than on the estate he has deserted ... if a plan can be adopted whereby a vagrant when arrested shall be employed at work just a little more irksome than that on estates, and shall receive less food than the Planter is bound by law to furnish, vagrancy will at no distant date be reduced within circumscribed limits ... By thus separating the Indian immigrants from the ordinary criminal classes, a treatment suitable to the circumstances of their race can be applied, whilst their isolation ... will materially facilitate the claiming of labourers by their employers and the restoration, on the expiration of their sentences, to the estates to which they may have been indentured.[54]

 Like the English workhouse, the Depot was an institution combining elements of the prison and the factory. It aimed at discouraging idleness and at instilling docility and a sense of duty in the potential labourers confined within its walls. The changes initiated by Anson were thought of as very effective by the colonists and his efforts to place vagrancy under a regime disoiiplinaire were highly commended in the colonial press.
 The Labour Code of 1867 represented an attempt to place ‘old immigrants’, and even the free passenger Indians, under the close control and regimentation to which indentured labourers were subject. These restrictions on their movement were ostensibly because, hitherto, ‘this class of the community has been suffered to live precisely as it thought proper, and there can be no doubt that not only the increase of crime but the deterioration of the Sanitary State of the Island are mainly due to the licence thus permitted.


-----

##### ‘[55] The measure, however, also had the effect of placing additional obstacles in the path of the emergence of an Indian peasantry and of an urbanised class of petty traders and artisans. By 1856, there were 19, 327 Indian males in such occupations and 73, 168 indentured labourers on sugar estates. By 1869, their numbers had increased to 31, 367 compared to 68, 290 labourers working permanently on the plantations.[56] During indenture, Indians showed remarkable thrift. This was in order to accumulate sufficient funds to pay for licences for carrying on a wide range of petty trading and manufacturing ventures, or to purchase or lease land and acquire cows, draught animals, carts and carriages, which could be used to earn an independent livelihood on the expiry of their contracts. These activities included market gardening, dairying and freight and passenger transport services.
 Sugar planters were initially in favour of the permanent settlement of Indians in Mauritius, hoping that this would lead to the formation of a rural labouring population from within, from which estate labour could be recruited, and which would lessen the sugar industry’s dependence on imported workers. Repeated attempts were then made to curb the growth of an Indian peasantry and to restrict the range of opportunities available in petty trading and manufacture .
 With regard to agricultural pursuits, much of the best land on the island had been alienated to French settlers during the eighteenth century and was in the hands of sugar planters. However, much of this land, though privately owned, was formerly uncleared, relatively inaccessible and therefore, ideal for squatters. When the sugar industry embarked on a phase of expansion in the 1850s, sugar cultivation was extended on to this vacant land while squatters were forced on to agriculturally marginal areas, such as the damp forests of the central plateau.
 Regulations for the sale or renting of Crown Lands markedly favoured large rather than small holders. Thus, the upset price for small plots of from two to three acres was set at £15 per acre compared with the much lower price of £3 per acre for plots of fifty acres. The regulations were not strictly enforced until the mid-1850s, when the Port Louis district was surveyed and squatters were forced to purchase or rent the land they occupied.
 As for petty trading and manufacture. Ordinance No.27 of 1845 laid down that, but for a few exceptions, licences were required for all occupations. The price of such licences was set at a prohibitive level. There is evidence from police statistical returns, that policemen, acting as inspectors of licences or in


-----

##### their own capacity, systematically harrassed persons engaged in petty agricultural, commercial and industrial activities. Large fines were imposed for a wide range of possible contraventions. Indians tried in various ways to circumvent such restrictive practices, in order to establish a material basis for their existence outside the rigours of plantation life.
 The initial acceptance and subsequent opposition of the colonial state and ruling class to the rise of an Indian peasantry and urban petty bourgeoisie suggests an ambivalent relationship which calls for elucidation. To maintain the planters’ monopoly over land and labour, it was essential to limit the growth of alternative economic activities.
 These activities would not only constitute competition for land but also a withdrawal of labour from the plantation sector. The rise of a free peasantry is depicted, in this perspective, as a means of escape from the plantation and as a form of resistance to planter hegemony. The movement of Indians from the estates into the peasant sector was undoubtedly an expression of the desire to be free from this domination. The independence which the peasants secured, however, was largely illusory. The scale of peasant production was directly sustained and at the same time constrained by, the nature and extent of demand of the sugar plantations for non-plantation products. The town of Port Louis which was the major market for peasant crops owed its existence chiefly to the financial, commercial and administrative requirements of the sugar industry. Opportunities for peasant production were reduced by the economy’s continued dependence on external sources of labour, capital and market demand and by the limitations which this dependency and the survival of the plantation system placed on the evolution of the internal market. The prominence of sugar was unquestioned and peasants could not escape its all-pervasive influence. This made the peasant sector, in effect, little else than a sub-sector of the plantation economy.
 The planters, for their part, viewed the peasantry in ambivalent terms. On the one hand, the peasants did compete for scarce resources to which they had laid claim. On the other, the peasants performed tasks useful to the sugar industry, such as the growth of foodstuffs, the manufacture of sugar bags, the production of charcoal and lime used in the production process, the carting of sugar. But the peasantry was not only useful, it was also ‘necessary to the plantation in providing the base for sustenance, maintenance and reproduction of the working class’.[57] As the peasantry grew in size, it came to represent an industrial reserve army, a pool of labour from which casual


-----

##### labourers could be recruited during the peak seasons. The structure of the plantation labour force was thus rendered more flexible. The captive core of immigrant labourers, indentured for five years, was surrounded by layers of locally recruited workers, engaged for shorter periods. This served as a cushion in times of depression when these groups were made to bear the burden of wage-cuts and unemployment. The need for labour which could be recruited and dismissed with relative ease was felt particularly strongly in the mid-1860s, when sugar prices were depressed. The five year contracts which had proved a boon in periods of rising prices in stabilising wages, proved a liability in times of depression when downward adjustments in wages became necessary. In its capacity as a reserve army for the plantation sector, the peasantry was permitted to exist, but its development was thwarted by a host of restrictive measures, designed to erode its viability and force the bulk of its members on to the market for estate labour. In the thirty-five years after the abolition of slavery, the sugar planters of Mauritius with the aid of the colonial government and its organs succeeded in consolidating a system of forced labour, based on Indian immigration and indentured service, which established the dominance of the plantation and of sugar-monoculture in the colonial economy. The ideological and coercive means employed to stabilise this system were visibly embodied in the Labour Code of 1867 which stands as a landmark in the history of labour repression under British colonialism.
 Historians of this period have generally focus-sed on the Royal Commission of Inquiry of 1873, which was appointed to investigate the grievances of Indian labourers, as expressed in mass protests against the more extreme provisions of this legislation. We are told that the reforms recommended by Commissioners W.E. Frere and V.A. Williamson laid the basis for the more ‘humane’ labour law of 1878, which remained in force until 1922, leading to perceptible improvements in labour conditions.[58] What is often overlooked and underemphasised, however, is the extent to which the reforms left the substance of the Labour Code of 1867 intact. Under the modified legislation, labourers could still be jailed for up to three months for desertion, while ‘neglect of stipulated work, improper performance of it, indolence, insulting language to employer or overseer, refusal to obey a reasonable order’, could entail the loss of two weeks wages or imprisonment with hard labour for the same period.[59] Moreover, the spirit in which the Labour Law of 1867 was framed continued to pervade the policies and practices of the colonial state with regard to Indian indentured labour and

##### labour relations generally, throughout the ensuing generations. Thus labour combinations were outlawed until 1937 in terms of legislation dating back to the French period and limitations continued to be imposed on the geographical and occupational mobility of labour.
 Little progress was made in the provision of adequate social services for the Indian population, who continued to suffer from pervasive racial discrimination and were burdened with many legal disabilities. Education remained second-rate and health provisions inadequate. Sewerage works in Port Louis were not started before 1900 and not completed until thirty years later. No serious campaigns to eradicate malaria were undertaken until the late 1940s, even though it was known half a century earlier, how the disease was carried and that its incidence could be effectively reduced by proper drainage schemes.
 The coercion and neglect to which the bulk of the population were thus subject reflected the economic and political dominance of the sugar planters and the correspondence of metropolitan policy with local interests on the subject of labour utilisation and of colonial production. Political power in Mauritius was, in practice, vested in the hands of a small minority of grands blanos until 1948. High franchise requirements excluded all but a small minority from the political process. At the turn of the century only 6, 071 persons, or one sixth of a per cent of the population had the right to vote.[60]
 This denial of political rights to the majority, prevented the possibility of social and economic change through formal political activity. Consequently, the benefits flowing from the growth of the sugar industry accrued almost exclusively to the colonial elite.
 Colonial society retained its servile foundation after 1834. While the metropolitan government abolished the slave trade and the institution of slavery, it did not oppose the importation of Indian indentured labourers into the sugar colonies after emancipation. It is true that from time to time, Indian immigration was subject to temporary prohibitions, and, that attempts were made to prevent the traffic from degenerating into a new slave trade. However, it cannot be denied that Indian indentured labour was in many respects a ‘new species of slavery’. It replaced the captive labour force, which the planters had lost as a result of emancipation. It was cheap and permitted the expansion of production on the basis of traditional technology. Under the pressure of competition from abroad, improved machinery for sugar manufacture was installed in sugar-mills, but little technological


-----

##### progress was recorded in agriculture. Sugar-cane continued to be cultivated in much the same way as under slavery and implementai cultivation was not adopted on any significant scale until the end of Indian immigration or, ’so long as labour remained cheap and sufficiently abundant.’[61] Like the slave population, the indentured labour force was subject to natural decrease, owing to sexual imbalance, but it could also be easily maintained or increased by regular annual importations. Indentured workers experienced living and working conditions little different from those of slaves. Moreover, they were subject to a plethora of coercive laws which had the effect of negating the voluntary basis of their engagement.[62]
 Although the system of Indian indentured labour resembled slavery in many respects, recognition of historical continuities between slavery and indenture should not obscure the dynamics involved in this historical process. The indentured labourer was not a slave and the transition from slavery to indenture, though it allowed the persistence of planter hegemony, did open opportunities for change, realisable in the longer-term, which would not have been available within the logic of the regime eselavagiste. Emancipation made possible the emergence of a peasantry, composed of former slaves whose ranks were increasingly swollen by the movement of time-expired Indian labourers off the plantations. The growth of this peasantry was stunted by the triumph of sugar mono-culture. The permanence of this victory is one of the hard realities of Mauritian history. However, this should not be allowed to obscure the on-going processes of class formation, which gave new dimensions to class conflict, set in motion by emancipation and which, in time, began to undermine that triumph.
 In the 1880s, a severe agricultural crisis led to a morcellement, or to a subdivision of estates and to the selling or leasing of land to Indian small growers. The partial break-down of plantations and the eventual dispersal of the indentured labour force which this entailed, boosted the formation of an Indo-Mauritian class of small farmers and peasants and of a large unskilled rural proletariat. The former group, tied to the sugar industry by financial and commercial chains of dependence and through the labour market, together with sections of the urban petty bourgeoisie, furnished the leadership and social basis for the drive to Mauritian independence. This movement, incipient in the 1930s and gathering momentum after the promulgation of the 1948 constitution, culminated in the attainment of formal independence twenty years later. The proletariat, hired essentially on a daily basis and

##### vulnerable to violent seasonal fluctuations in employment, was subject to gross exploitation. In the late 1930s, it too began to organise and to struggle against a repressive labour regime inherited from the days of slavery and unfree indentured service. In the face of official and class repression and in the context of the depressed inter-war years, the Mauritian labour movement initially made little progress. Hence the class struggle assumed a desperate and violent character, as shown in the disturbances of 1931, 1937 and 1943. The early history of the labour movement, its resurgence in the post-war era, the part it played in the fight against colonialism before 1968 and against neocolonialism thereafter testifies to the wider possibilities of historical- progress through class struggle opened by emancipation. However, it also shows all too clearly how generations of conflict failed to loosen significantly the grip which the Mauritian sugarocracy held on economic and political power. The strategy of indentured Indian immigration was partly responsible for this. To terminate the stranglehold of the sugarocracy remains the prerequisite for genuine social reform, meaningful political participation and real economic justice.

##### Notes to Appendix

 1. There were fifty separate occupations, ranging from auctioneer to wheelwright, listed under the first category. Ex-apprentices were particularly numerous in the occupations of dressmaker, milliner and seamstress (2, 060), carpenter and joiner (1, 795), mason and bricklayer (1, 279), carter (708), mat-maker (408), boot and shoemaker (248) and hawker (228).
 2. Ex-apprentices working on sugar estates included clerks (296), labourers (189) and sirdars(l). Ex-apprentices employed in agriculture, outside sugar estates, included woodcutters (121), gardeners (341) and others (3, 878) presumably in casual employment.
 3. Ex-apprentices in the category of labourers were employed as labourer and workman (3, 033), washerman and woman (1, 538), watchman and house guardian (210), stone and tombstone cutter (37), porter and messenger (23).
 4. No ex-apprentices were employed in the military.

 15. In 1846 the planters of Flacq district deplored that ploughs were not used in parts of the island where terres franches existed. Six years later, the writer of a treatise on sugar cultivation acknowledged that ploughing experiments had failed, even where the soil was suitable, so that cane was still being hand-planted in individually dug holes. This writer believed however, that implementai tillage could not be introduced on a large scale in Mauritius because of the prevalence of stony soils. Yet this obstacle was not insuperable, since stones and boulders were normally removed from cane fields and heaped in mounds or (meules) or piled up into walls - an epierrag e which made the use of agricultural implements on the cleared ground technically feasible. The main obstacle to implementai agriculture in the nineteenth century, as many authors acknowledge, was the availability of cheap labour. It is only after Indian indentured immigration was halted in 1907, that labour-saving devices in field work were adopted on a large scale. The seasonal nature of sugar production did, however, restrict the opportunities for substituting capital for labour in field work. The extent of cultivation was severely limited by the availability of hands at crop time, since cane had to be laboriously cut by hand and no effective mechanical cane harvester was produced in the nineteenth century.

 LABOURING MEN AND NOTHING MORE: SOME PROBLEMS OF INDIAN INDENTURE IN FIJI.[1]

 Brij V. Lai

##### The emigration of Indian indentured labourers to Fiji was a part of a larger process of labour migration from India, beginning with the abolition of slavery in 1834. Altogether over one million Indians were transported across the seas to parts of Africa, Mauritius, Southeast Asia, the Pacific and the West Indies.[2] Of these, 60, 965 came to Fiji between 1879, when the migration began until 1916 when it finally ceased.[3] The introduction of Indians into Fiji was a direct result of the reluctant annexation of the islands by Great Britain in 1874. Of the many complex problems which faced the nascent administration of Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon, the first important governor (1875-1880), none was more urgent than economic solvency. It was made all the more so by an unexpected fall in revenue from native customs and taxes in 1874 and by the reduction in the initial proposed grant from the Imperial Government of £150, 000 to £100, 000.[4]
 To promote rapid economic development, Gordon advocated plantation agriculture. This choice required both a heavy and sustained investment of capital and an assured supply of cheap labour. As it happened, neither of these was available. The local European planters were in a state of despair, reeling under the effects of economic depression caused by the collapse of the cotton boom of the 1860s. It was obvious that Gordon would have to look elsewhere. He invited the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR), an extensive Australian enterprise, to extend its operations to Fiji, which it did in 1882. It remained there till 1973.[5] The problem of labour supply proved more difficult. Commercial employment of Fijian labour was prohibited by Gordon, who reasoned, with good sense, that if the local population was suddenly exposed to the alien challenges of the plantation regime, they might decline disastrously like indigenous peoples elsewhere. He therefore decreed that they should develop at their own pace and in the context of their


-----

##### traditional lifestyles,[6] and paternalistically shielded them from the reach of the planters. In any case, the Fijians did not much care for plantation work, offering as it did to them, ‘paltry pay, indifferent fare, and frequently anything but mild treatment’.[7] The other possible source of labour from neighbouring Pacific islands - New Hebrides, Solomons, Gilberts and Tokelau - proved to be ‘eminently precarious’,[8] because of a decline in indigenous population in these islands and an increasingly intense competition for the labourers from Queensland, Samoa and New Caledonia. It should be noted, however, that continued reliance on ‘Polynesian’ labour, as it was erroneously called, would have been impolitic as one of the strongest motives for the annexation of Fiji was the curtailment of abuse in the Melanesian labour traffic.
 Other avenues would necessarily have to be explored and Gordon, with previous experience with Indian labour in Trinidad and Mauritius where he had been governor before coming to Fiji, turned to India. By the 1870s, the basic structure of indentured emigration had been firmly established. Hence the Government of India was inclined to leave the matter to the ‘ordinary laws of supply and demand’[9] although it required as a matter of formality certain geographical and economic information about the colony. These were furnished in due course, and paved the way for the extensive emigration of Indian indentured labour.
 Indentured emigration was state regulated. The actual conditions of employment were stated on a form of agreement in English, Hindi and Urdu, which were distributed in the districts of recruitment. The terms varied in some minute details over the years and between the different colonies, but all specified the conditions of work, pay, accommodation and provision of certain basic facilities. Typical conditions offered to the Fiji migrants stated that they would primarily be engaged in work related to the cultivation and manufacture of certain products; that they would work for nine hours each week day and five on Saturdays, with Sundays and public holidays being free; that males would be paid one shilling and females nine pence for time as well as task work, a male’s task being defined as six hours of steady work and female’s four and a half; that free rations on a government stipulated scale would be provided for the first six months, and housing and medical facilities for the entire duration of indenture; and finally that at the end of ten years industrial residence, an optional free return passage would be available to all indentured servants.[10]


-----

##### Yet, certain provisions in the agreement, such as those relating to task work, were ambiguous and their interpretation was left to the overseers, much to the disadvantage of the labourers. Furthermore, nothing was said about the cost of living in the colony and, even more seriously, about the penal sanctions for breaches of contract. These were matters which were to cause great suffering to the indentured labourers in Fiji. It is, of course, debatable whether the Indians would have migrated had they fully understood the realities which awaited them in Fiji. But it should be stressed that most of the migrants left their homes with the firm belief that their sojourn in Fiji, or in any other colony for that matter, would be brief, and that they would return after five or ten years when they had accumulated sufficient wealth. As it happened, only twenty four thousand went back,[11]
 many for good while others to visit their janmabhumi (motherland) or to bring back their relatives. The rest had set their roots in Fiji; for them the day of decision would never come.
 About seventy five per cent of the migrants boarded the ships at Calcutta and the rest from Madras after recruitment was started there in 1903. North India was the logical choice as the centre of recruitment, not only because it was perceived to be overpopulated but also because it had been for forty-five years before 1879, the chief recruiting ground for the other sugar colonies. Hence the government could share with the other colonies their recruiting facilities and personnel instead of having to start afresh.
 Table 5.1 gives a breakdown of the provincial origins of the Calcutta embarked indentured emigrants. The United Provinces (NWP and Oudh) was prominent because no employment opportunities were available there which might have absorbed the surplus, dislocated population. Bihar and the Central Provinces, two other poor and heavily populated areas, on the other hand, did offer at least some possibilities for employment to its needy inhabitants: in the former in the indigo plantations and coal mines and in the latter in the colonisation of vast tracts of uninhabited land. In the case of other areas, Bengal had its jute mills, the Punjab canal colonies and Western India its textile mills.[12]

 Table 5.1: Provincial Origins of Fiji's Calcutta Embarked Migrants

##### In the UP itself, the impoverished eastern districts (Basti, Gonda, Sultanpur, Fyzabad, Agamgarh and Gorakhpur) contributed the largest numbers. These were (and still are) the poorest and most densely populated districts in the province, isolated and with no substantial industries. Western UP at least had textile mills at Kanpur which absorbed some of the surplus local labour. On the other hand, the poorbeas, as the eastern UP peasants were called, were used to the idea of migrating long distances -to Bengal jute mills, Assam tea gardens and even Bombay textile mills - in search of employment.[13] To them, therefore, the journey to Fiji was not as big a hurdle as is sometimes made out to be. It is surprising, even so, to note that a very large percentage of the recruits had already left their homes before they were enlisted by the recruiting agents. Thus in the case of Azamgarh, 97% of the migrants were recruited outside the district, in Basti 59%, Gonda 70% and Sultanpur 90%.[14] Except when the emigrant himself declared that he had left his native district on his own accord, outside registration was illegal and on several occasions recruiters indulging in the practice had their licence withdrawn. But even if some emigrants were schooled to give proper answers to the officials, we can safely assume the majority had left their

##### districts on their own volition. Thus the initial break had already been made, a point which those who emphasise deception do not take well enough into account.
 This widespread spatial mobility which was clearly under way was a direct consequence of changes taking place in rural Indian society caused by British penetration. The ultimate causes of these cannot be detailed here.[15]
 But among changes which had a direct bearing on the causes of migration were the excessive revenue demands by the British, the commercialisation of agriculture which benefited only a handful of rich peasants and merchant interests, the dramatic increases in rent, but more importantly the change in rent in kind to cash which contributed variously to growing instability in the rural social structure, the decline of indigenous handicraft industry as a result of unfavourable competition with Britain, and the constantly recurring spectre of famine which stalked the land periodically in the nineteenth century. These forces, together, unleashed changes which left many dispossessed of their land and labour.
 All segments of Indian society were affected by the changes, though not equally. Those who bore the brunt of the vicissitudes most were drawn largely from the lower agricultural classes - petty owners, cultivators, agricultural and landless labourers and artisans. Moreover, it was the lower to middling castes who were always the first to feel the effects of adverse changes, and it is thus not surprising that they contributed the largest numbers. Middling agricultural and artisan castes (such as Ahir, Kurmi, Kahar, etc.) contributed 15, 800 migrants or 34.8 per cent of the North Indian total, and low menial castes (Chamar, Kori, Pasi, etc.) provided 11, 907 migrants or 26.2 per cent. But higher castes also migrated as, contrary to the conventional wisdom, large numbers of them were deriving their livelihood from land. Thus Brahmans and allied castes contributed 1, 686 (3.7 per cent) of the migrants, Kshattriya 4, 565 (10.0 per cent) and Bania 1, 592 (3.5 per cent).[16] Caste had no relevance as far as plantation work was concerned, and yet the Indians were constantly reminded during girmit and later of their supposedly invariable low origins. It was a device to remind the Indians of their proper place in society: as Ken Gillion has observed, derogatory myths about the Indians were ‘a part of the ideological underpining of European dominance ’.[17]
 It was, then, the gradual fragmentation of Indian agrarian society under the impact of new forces, which pushed the Indians out of the security of their


-----

##### ancestral villages. Recruiters and their illegal agents, arkatis made the most of the unfortunate circumstances by painting a picture of glorious opportunities waiting to be exploited abroad. The uncertain and the gullible fell prey to their guile, but the process of dislocation had already begun before the recruiter met the potential migrant. This process of fragmentation or dislocation, as much in the mind of the migrants as in the external world, continued on the journey to the port of embarkation, in the waiting period in the crowded, filthy depots at Matiabruj, Calcutta, and on the voyage which could take anything up to three months. Traditional barriers which had separated people: caste, religion and language, all gradually began to lose their meaning as the migrants rubbed shoulders with each other, shared their living quarters and ate food cooked in the same pot. The traumatic process of ‘de-socialisation’ continued even more forcefully on the plantation in Fiji.
 It is interesting to note that in the very early years, the arrival of Indian indentured labour was greeted with little enthusiasm by the planters. Perhaps their negative response was due to the extra cost of Indian labour; perhaps also, they were protesting against Gordon for neglecting their vociferous demand to employ Fijians. Thus, only one planter, J. Hill of Rabi, offered to take 52 men and 25 women from the first batch which had arrived on the Leonidas in 1879; the rest were employed by the government.[18] However, the planter could not hang out for too long, especially with the declining supply of Melanesian labour. One of them, writing in the Suva Times in 1885 echoed the sentiments of his fellow planters:

 It is upon the Indian labour that the future of Fiji depends; for the Fijians have become so utterly demoralised by the mistaken policy of the Government that many of the larger planters have no Fijian labour, and others are only waiting for existing agreements to expire and will have no more. The supply from Polynesia is gradually ceasing, and therefore, we have nothing but Indian labour to depend upon, and it is undoubtedly the best in Fiji. Seeing that it is our only source of labour we must take it with the conditions imposed.[19]

 The indigenous Fijians had no voice in the introduction of the Indians. They were very much left to themselves. Nevertheless, one official minuted as early as 1884 that the Fijians regarded the Indians (and vice versa) ‘with unmitigated contempt and disgust’, and went on to predict that ‘assuredly there will someday be serious bloodshed’.[20] Three years later, a similar


-----

##### sentiment was expressed. The fear of dispossession, one official commented ‘lay at the bottom of the native dislike of the coolie’.[21] Even today, it provides the core of the Fijian’s suspicion of and muted hostility towards the Indian.
 In any event, the indentured labourers had little opportunity or time for contact with the outside world; for them the plantation remained the boundary of existence for five (or more) years. Special permission had to be obtained if any labourer wanted to get away from the plantation, even for a short period of time, or if anyone desired to enter it. The degree of control that the planters exercised over the lives of their indentured labourers was starkly illustrated when a free migrant, who visited his indentured wife still on the plantation without prior approval, was fined in a court of law.[22] From all oral, and by now extensive written accounts, it is clear that girmit for most indentured labourers, was a traumatic ordeal. The historian Ken Gillion was told in the 1950s by the givmitiyas that plantation life was narak (hell);[23] Ahmed Ali in the 1970s heard it described as kasbhigar (brothel).[24]
 The documentary evidence, too, paints an unhappy picture. The worst period for Indian indenture in Fiji was the late 1880s to the late 1890s, a decade which coincided with Sir John Thurston’s governorship of the colony and a rampant economic depression.[25] The problems which were unearthed by some remarkably sympathetic officials and by specially commissioned enquiries, were found in greater or lesser degree throughout the forty years of indenture. Thus, by concentrating on this period, insight can be gained into some of the worst problems of Indian indenture in Fiji.
 The root of many of the problems lay in the powerful influence of CSR which monopolised plantation agriculture in Fiji, after economic problems had forced smaller plantations to close down or sell out to larger concerns such as CSR. This company, moreover, exerted considerable pressure on the government which, always mindful of economic solvency, usually acceded to its requests. During Thurston’s term (1888-1897), the CSR was aided by Thurston’s uncaring and unsympathetic attitude to the Indian labourers. He regarded the Indians as ‘a working population and nothing more, ’[26] a view with which CSR was in complete agreement. In such a circumstance, it is not surprising to find that the planters (including CSR) were given unfettered control over the labourers, and even more ominously, left with the responsibility of interpreting some of the most important terms of employment in the Agreement. Abuses were certain to arise, as they did.


-----

##### One of the problems that the indentured labourers persistently complained about, especially during the first two decades of girmit, was overtasking. The employers had the choice of either employing labour on time-rate or task rate. Initially they tried the former, but finding it unsatisfactory switched to the task system. The reason frequently given was ‘the want of ordinary diligence’ on the part of the labourers. William Seed, the first Agent-General of Immigration, opined that the change suited ‘the master and the servant much better’;[27] in truth, it suited only the master and not the servant. The problem arose because of the imprecise definition of what constituted a task, apart from the guideline that it ought to be work which an average, able- bodied male worker could complete in six hours steady work. The definition and allotment of tasks in the field was left to the discretion of the overseer who was ‘to all intents and purposes the sole judge of the fair limits of the task work ...’[28] Frequently, tasks were set on the basis of what a few handpiaked men could do,[29] a yardstick which put undue pressure on the others. Moreover, the tasks could be increased the following day if the overseer found them completed on or before time, and for this reason no indentured labourer took on a second task in one day.[30] Indeed, in Koronivia, the labourers complained that tasks were altered at the overseers’whim while work was still in progress.[31]
 Another yardstick overzealous overseers used was the amount of task set on other plantations. This practice, to all appearances, has a ring of impartiality about it. Yet, it had its dangers for conditions on different plantations varied enormously. There could be variations in soil, terrain, and the number of times the ground had been worked over. Thus to set the standard on one plantation on the basis of another without careful thought was, once again, to put extra pressure on the labourers. Overtasking was a major problem especially on the larger estates belonging to large companies such as CSR. Each estate was under a manager who was responsible for the results on the plantation under his control. The system worked well in normal times. but when the production fell below the target, when the return per acre of cane was unremunerative -because of overestimation of yield, lack of manure -a natural rivalry developed among the overseers to see ‘who can get the maximum amount of work done for minimum amount of pay.’[32]
 Since there were no other avenues which might be explored to increase production, they leaned once again on the hapless indentured labourers, the pressure being ’ in the shape of large tasks’.


-----

##### It is not surprising to find that a large number of the labourers could not complete their tasks in time or at all. Table 5.2 illustrates this point with reference to the Rewa area, which was typical of the situation in others in the 1880s and 1890s.

 Table 5.2: Tasks in the Rewa Region, Fiji 1885

 Those who did manage to finish their work, did so ‘by working exceptionally long hours.’[33] The labourers who might have contemplated court action over overtasking, would have acted in vain. John Foster, an Immigration Sub- agent, noted their difficulties :

 ...the indefinitiveness of the legal definition obviously leaves the limits of a fair task entirely an open question and a matter of opinion, and supposing a prosecution for overtasking can be and is instituted, the weight of opinion is found on the side of the skilled evidence the employer can bring forward in his favour as against the evidence of an


-----

##### ignorant coolie. The court has to decide on evidence not on the private opinion of the presiding magistrate.[34]

 It was a different story with the planters who were able successfully to charge the immigrants for breaches of labour ordinances of the colony, which included failure to complete tasks. Table 5.3 clearly shows that the overwhelming majority of the indentured labourers were convicted. The high rate of conviction is surprising; it is even more surprising that it was almost twice as high as in other colonies such as British Guiana.[35]

 Table 5.3: Conviction Rate of Indian Indentured Migrants in Fiji for Breaches of Labour Ordinances*

 The conviction was costly to the labourer. It meant that he or she would lose pay for the number of days spent in court. The period of indenture would be extended by the number of days he or she was away from work. And, on top of all this, he or she could be fined.
 At other times, the planters took the law in their own hands. They themselves extended the indenture if their labourers did less than five and a half tasks a week. But more seriously, they began to dock pay for any incomplete task, irrespective of the reason for its non-completion. Thus, for example, an immigrant who had a ten chain task, and completed only six, got no credit for the work done, which went to the credit of the employer. This


-----

##### illegal practice had been in existence for some time before it was brought to the attention of the authorities. The official reaction was revealing. Mr Carruthers, an Inspector of Immigrants, when notified by the labourers of pay-cutting said: ‘I took no great notice of it, for it had never occurred to me to doubt the illegality of the system, or its value as a [form of] punishment.’[36] Thurston conceded that ‘I did not know before that an unfinished task need not be paid for’, but added that ‘there is certainly some force in the argument advanced for following this course’.[37] What the arguments were, he did not elaborate. The issue was placed before the Attorney General for legal opinion. He observed that:

 It may be stated as a general legal proposition that if a person engages to perform a given task or a piece of work for a given wage and fails to perform such a task he forfeits all claim to the wage: for the performance of the task is the condition precedent to the payment of the wage.[38]

 He thus upheld the right of the manager of Koronivia plantation of not paying his labourers for partially done or incomplete task. The government did not bother to inquire into the rights and responsibilities of the labourers, and most importantly, into why in such a large number of cases, tasks were not completed.
 The result of planter persecution and government indifference ensured that the majority of the Indians did not get the minimum statutory wage. Henry Anson, the Agent-General of Immigration in 1887, raised a pertinent point in response to CSR’s persistent complaint about the unworthiness of the Indian labourer: ‘Granted that the Indians are bad, lazy and inferior as a class to those in other colonies, one would even then expect that more than 8 per cent would manage during a year to attain over the minimum statutory wage at field work.’[39] The statistics continued to reveal a grim picture. In 1891, A.C. Stewart, Fiji’s Emigration Agent in India wrote to Horace Emberson, Agent- General of Immigration, that the ‘wages seem to me to be altogether too low, so low that I do not see how the majority of people can thrive. I do hope you will succeed in screwing up the planters further. They need it all the world over.[40] The situation remained much the same in the late 1890s as it had been in the 1880s. In 1897, for example, seventy nine percent of the male immigrants earned as much as eight pence per working day and sixty three per cent of the females five pence.[41] Low wages led or at least contributed to


-----

##### a number of other problems such as poor and inadequate food, which, in turn, caused sickness. Ill health led to absence from work, a problem which had become acute by the 1890s.[42] Absence meant loss of wages and prosecution in a court of law. The vicious cycle was thus complete.
 The hold of the planters over the indentured labourers was evident in other areas also. One of these was in their power to move at will immigrants from one place to another. It should be remembered that the indentured labourers had no say in their allocation, nor, even if they wanted to, could they ask for removal to another plantation except by buying out their contract. The implicit understanding seems to have been that their residence would remain unchanged throughout the period of girmit. However, in the 1880s,[43] it emerged that some planters engaged in unauthorised transfer of immigrants. Sometimes, the transfer was a simple case of illegal labour trafficking, when planters hired their labourers at double the statutory price to their needy colleagues and thus made a profit in the process. At other times, transfers could occur as a result of the amalgamation of neighbouring plantations, or when an estate folded up.[44] Then, too, the planters could argue for the need to move old hands to break up new (and generally unhealty) areas while new arrivals were being acclimatised on older plantations. The economic argument was understandable enough from the planters’ point of view; at any rate it was sufficient to convince the government of the need to draft new regulations to make transfers legal. But there was more to it than met the eye at first. John Foster noted that:

 There is one test for the truthfulness and honesty of this [economic] plea. If the employer will pay time wages for men so employed the objection loses much weight. But the employer only wishes generally to so employ his labourers under the penal sanctions imposed and under the task system only.[45]

 The real intention, then, seems to have been to squeeze the last ounce of work from the indentured labourer and thus increase production without incur ring any extra expenditure.
 Thus constant insecurity and rapid change of the place of work understandably caused much unhap-piness among the labourers. Moreover, it prevented any concerted attempt on the part of the labourers to organise themselves in order to protect their rights. Indeed, this was one of the very


-----

##### reasons why CSR wanted a free hand in moving its labourers about, because ‘it is desirable to break up a gang of men who have caused or are likely to cause serious disturbance of the peace.’[46] It also meant that the labourers walked longer distances to work and toiled for longer hours in usually harsh and unhealthy areas at the old rate of pay, without any bonus. At the same time it caused much domestic hardship among the labourers. Unlike the Pacific Island labourers who were invariably fed by the masters throughout their period of indenture, the Indians had to provide their own food after six months. Consequently, they raised a few poultry and goats for meat and cattle for milk, and did a little gardening near the lines or dwellings. These had to be left behind either permanently or in the care of someone else while the labourers were transferred to other areas. John Foster summed up the miseries of the labourers admirably. He wrote that to an industrious worker

 ... it is not pleasant to be from day to day liable to be sent perhaps four miles off for a couple of days cane-cutting while his wife goes two or three miles in another direction for a week’s weeding living in strange houses while absent from what they would like to make their homes. If anything could add to the demoralising effect of the penal system under which these men live it would be this liability to nomadic state of life ... It appears to me that fatal and disastrous as the conditions of plantation life now are as shown by hard facts they cannot but be rendered worse by the mental and material harrassment to which large extension of the limits of his sphere of labour will expose the labourers.[47]

 It is thus not surprising that immigrants were extremely reluctant to go to areas which were a long distance away from their lines. Sometimes they preferred other forms of punishment rather than to be forcibly sent to other plantations, as a transfer denoted a form of punishment for disobedience, or other breaches of the labour laws. Here is what Baldi, an indentured labourer on Tamanua plantation in 1893, had to say: ‘I was given the choice of going to Naitonitoni [a neighbouring plantation] or taking a thrashing. I accepted the thrashing.’[48] Foster went on to point out that the process of inspection would be extremely difficult on the fragmented and scattered plantations and that because of this, there would be an increased temptation on the part of the planters to evade the law. Moreover, the enforcement of the existing legislations would be made more difficult than it already was. ‘The occurrence of any such breach even if prosecuted, ’ he minuted, ‘will be the

##### occasion of acrimonious dispute as to facts or pathetic remonstrance as to special circumstances (by a coincidence always existent in such cases) exonerating the of fenders .’[49] Thurston was aware of the difficulties that were involved, and conceded that the right of compulsory transfer put ‘too much power into European hands to harrass a man’,[50] but let the matter pass.
 The people who made the system work were the overseers/managers and sirdars, Indian foremen. The former were usually young Europeans while the latter were chosen on the basis of the power and influence they exercised among the Indians and on their ability to make their compatriots work. Not all the overseers were callous or brutal as conversation with some still surviving indentured labourers clearly indicates. Those who worked on smaller or their own estates seem to have been more relaxed and understanding and little about them appears in the record; it was those overseers on larger plantations, competing among themselves to produce more with less, who acquired notoriety. Some names stood out. One of the most notorious overseers in the early years was James Tarby, of Tamanua plantation in Navua. He was known to have unleashed ‘a reign of terror’ among the labourers there and ‘ruled through illegal violence [my italics] rather than resort to the law.’[51] Later he moved to Koronivia where his attitude towards the labourers precipitated a strike. As one labourer put it, Tarby’speaks our language perfectly and abuses us in it far too freely [and] is the cause of .all our troubles.’[52] Another, again in Koronivia, was a deaf overseer named Lee who had no knowledge of Hindustani but ‘who was obliged to go about with a revolver with which it is alleged [he] threatens men when immigrants complain to him and he cannot understand.’[53] And then there was William Good, Manager of C.L. Sahl’s Vunicibioibi estate in Rewa, from which immigrants were withdrawn On account of the not very liberal treatment of the Estate.’[54]
 But powerful as the overseers were, they could not function effectively without the support and co-operation of their sirdars. Each needed the other. The overseer needed the sirdar to communicate his instructions to the labourers, and to assist him to carry out his duties in the field. In the event of trouble, the sirdar was usually the point man for his overseer. Clearly, a good sirdar was a valuable asset, not to be lost. Thus in Ba in 1897, fines inflicted on sirdars for assaulting labourers were returned to them by the overseers.[55]
 This was made known to the labourers so as to underline the futility of laying further complaints. In Labasa in 1899, a sirdar whose beatings had


-----

##### reduced a woman to ‘a mass of bruises’ was retained by the manager of the Nagigi plantation, despite remonstrance from immigration officials. He justified his action on the ground that it was the sirdar’s first offence and that ‘the constant change of sirdars at Nagigi is not calculated to benefit the labourer.’[56] But the sirdars, too, needed the patronage of their overseers. Being a sirdar meant that one was spared the ordeal of hard field labour, besides getting better pay and, above all, the ear of the master. The position also brought the opportunity of accumulating a little wealth on the side. The evidence shows that the sirdars were not averse to seizing it. As early as 1885, the Agent General of Immigration noted that:

 Very large sumes have been amassed by Sirdars and other immigrants placed in positions of authority. As the pressure of financial difficulties of estates increases, the tendency is to increase the number and responsibility of such employees.[57]

 Making matters even worse for the labourers was the fact that on many plantations, the employers allowed their sirdars to open up stores. The labourers were compelled to buy from the sirdar; as one official put it, ‘it is unnecessary to state how pressure can be put on an immigrant by the sirdar to compel him to deal at his store.’[58] Once begun, it was extremely difficult to end the debt.
 Assaults by overseers and sirdars on both male and female immigrants were frequent occurrences on most plantations, though more so in places such as Labasa which were isolated and thus subject to less frequent inspections, and even lesser public criticism. The extent to which violence by those in authority was prevalent is indicated in Sergeant Lynch’s comment: ‘If assault convictions mean that a man is a bad character then nearly all the officers of the Company are bad characters[59] What aggravated the situation was the fact that the labourers found it difficult to lay charges against the management because the overseers and sirdars prevented them from going to the police. Thus to avoid detection and punishment, the labourers went to the police at night, usually between nine and midnight. The consequence of being caught was severe; apart from being beaten, the immigrants stood to lose their wages and be rewarded with excessive tasks. It was demoralising, after all the risks that had to be taken, to find that the overseers and sirdars usually escaped with extremely light sentences, usually in the form of small


-----

##### fines. Later, during Sir Everard im Thurn’s governorship, an ordinance was passed which stiffened the penalty for assault on labourers.[60]
 To protect the welfare of the labourers and to enquire periodically into the conditions on the plantation, the regulations provided for the appointment of Inspectors of Immigrants. They were required to make at least one visit every six months to all plantations, report on the conditions present and advise the Agent-General of Immigration of any changes that should be recommended. In the 1880s and early 1890s, there were only a handful of roving inspectors, and stipendiary magistrates were given extended powers of inspection.[61] Even with such a small establishment, the government would have preferred to reduce the expenditure on inspection even further. But Henry Anson, that ever-vigilant Agent-General of Immigration, presented his case brilliantly and the government did not move further. Anson argued:

 To do away with inspection will be to inaugurate a condition of things of which the following would be the most salient features: oppression productive of attacks on overseers, etc., culminating in proceedings before the Supreme Court, in which the employed must always be at a disadvantage owing to the necessity for vindicating discipline, and the impossibility of bringing an equal force to bear against vested interests without the risk of ruinous consequences.[62]

 Later the situation improved somewhat with the appointment of resident inspectors in Labasa and Ba and also in the recently opened up area in Lautoka.
 The inspectors, such as Harpur in Labasa and Hamilton Hunter in Rewa, who had the moral courage to expose the abuses in the system unsparingly, played a very critical and salutary role. The fact that many of their observations were not taken into account by the government of the day was not their shortcoming, but that of the government which chose to ignore or shelve the hard facts. Yet, the officials who were closely attuned to the circumstances at the time, conceded that even the best of the inspectors could, in fact, play only a limited role. The means and also the expense of transport prevented surprise visits which might have enabled them to get a more realistic picture of the conditions on the plantation. As things were, the time of an inspector’s arrival was well known in advance, with the result that ‘everything is swept and garnished for his visits.’[63] Furthermore, the


-----

##### immigrants knew that the inspector’s visit was a transient phenomenon - and that no relief came after his half yearly or yearly visits. Consequently, it was potentially dangerous and costly to invite the master’s wrath by complaining in vain to the inspector. Hence, fewer complaints were registered with the inspectors. But even the inspectors themselves realised the ultimate futility of their job. The planters held sway on the plantations, and the law in substantial measure favoured them over inarticulate labourers. They knew that their visits were ‘bitterly though silently resented’, and that they could do little to induce the employers to give relief; any concession that was made was’simply out of a desire to keep things smooth’.[64]
 The inspector’s powers of intervention and enquiry were restricted. This was amply illustrated in an incident which occurred on Tamanua, plantation when the overseer, Tarby, severely beat two immigrants who had allegedly threatened to cut a sirdar’s head off for constantly taking sides with the overseer.[65] The sirdar took the two men to Tarby who slapped them. Then, upon advice from a fellow European who was present, he brought out the cane and asked the two men to cane each other. Not satisfied, Tarby himself did the job ‘handsomely’ and kicked and punched the two men in front of a large crowd of Indians. The case did not come before the Agent-General of Immigration for sometime, to a large extent because Indian witnesses were afraid of prosecution and harrassment from the overseers and sirdars. The management stood firm. Dixon, the manager told the resident Stipendiary Magistrate that he had made it known to all the labourers on the plantation that no prosecutions could be made by anyone without his permission. He appeared, furthermore, ’ to defend the overseer and to endorse his actions.’ Eventually when Inspector Coates did arrive, he conceded that he had no power to institute any proceedings against Tarby on behalf of the immigrants. And no penalty was provided for ‘ill-usage’ of labour except the cancelling of indenture, a course of action that would not have taken place. In the end when an enquiry was made, it was decided that the charge of bodily harm would not stand because the assaults were trivial. In any case, the officials argued, since ten days had passed since the assault, it would be ‘impossible’ to obtain reliable evidence about the amount and nature of the injuries. In the end, the labourers went back to their plantation and Tarby was fined £5. When Thurston was pressed to take some action, he minuted: ‘The reports of existing Terror on this plantation [Tamanua] are by no means new, but nothing tangible has been laid before the Executive.’[66] For this


-----

##### procrastination on the part of the immigration officials, Thurston himself was directly responsible; it was he in 1888 who emasculated the powers of the Immigration Department by amalgamating it with the office of the Receiver- General. Indeed, the Secretary of State attributed the unsatisfactory state of affairs on many plantations ‘mainly to the inadequate supervision which the Agent-General has been able in its greatly reduced condition to give to the various estates on which the coolies are employed.’[67]
 Sometimes, however, the inspectors, because of pressures of work or even carelessness, could be perfunctory in their inspection. A classic illustration was provided on the Vunioibioihi plantation. The inspector visited the plantation and wrote his report on 13 January 1881.[68] His impressions were favourable: the accommodation seemed adequate, the tasks were ‘fair and reasonable’ and food was supplied according to the prescribed scale. As to the general appearance of the labourers, he pronounced that ‘All look very well.’ There were no complaints from the labourers, though Gaggin, the storekeeper, complained of the labourers’ objection to having bluestone applied to their sores. Yet soon afterwards, problems developed on the plantation. Labourers complained of poor pay, overtasking, bad accommodation and insufficient food. The fed-up labourers erupted, and severely assaulted the manager, William Good. This precipitated an enquiry into the affairs of the plantation, and a completely different picture emerged. The inspector who visited the plantation on 6 July 1881 proclaimed that he was ‘dissatisfied with nearly everything I saw.’ As far as accommodation was concerned, he noted that the management had followed the letter of the law, though there was scarcely a cubic foot more that was legally required. He found that the labourers complained bitterly about space in the lines. The food items on the plantation were expensive, and the labourers were forced to obtain their needs from a neighbouring plantation. On the food that was served, he observed: ‘I can only stigmatise it as filth not even good enough for a superior class of poultry.’ He stated that the Indians were:

 A more miserable looking lot of men it has never been my lot to see during eleven years of experience of Indians than the Indians I saw on the 8th instant on your plantations. They looked half starved and wretched and were full of complaint as to work and wages.

 It may be that conditions on Vunieibioihi may have deteriorated dramatically within a span of three or four months. But it is more than likely in view of


-----

##### what has been said above, that the immigrants hesitated to complain to the inspector, or more likely, that the inspector did not enquire as closely as he should have done or was required to do. The terrible conditions would have continued unchecked had not the assault on Good brought about a close inspection of the state that existed on the plantation.
 Assault and even murder of overseers was one weapon still available to the Indians to vent their rage when all other avenues of redress seemed closed. It was frequently resorted to in isolated areas, such as Labasa, where the ‘murderous intent’ of the labourers was rapidly ‘becoming a serious danger’.[69] Thus in 1900, thirty-two charges of assault on overseers and sirdars were laid against the labourers, and there were eleven convictions; in 1901 twenty-one charges and fifteen convictions; and in 1902 thirty five Indians were charged (twenty-four in Labasa alone) of whom twenty-eight were convicted. In addition, seventeen Indians were tried and convicted in the Supreme Court for assault on overseers.[70] It is interesting to note that most of the assaults took place in the open and with the evident knowledge on the part of the Indians that they would be caught. The risk they took was, perhaps, an indication of the level of desperation.
 Another method the immigrants used to express their grievance (but soon gave up) was to strike. The first of these took place on CSR’s Navuso plantation when three hundred men struck work protesting against overtasking.[71] But perhaps the most serious strike during the entire period of indenture took place in May 1886 on Koronivia.[72] One hundred and thirty men struck work, and carrying their working implements -knives, hoes, axes and sticks - marched to Suva to meet the Agent General of Immigration, Henry Anson. Their previous efforts to locate the inspector had been unsuccessful and the Magistrate, they claimed, would not listen. They complained mostly of systematic overtasking, and more immediately, of the increase in shovel-ploughing from seven to ten chains, under-pay and vindicative attitude of the management. Anson gave them a sympathetic hearing, but referred them to the Stipendiary Magistrate of Rewa. Subsequent investigation revealed that the immigrants were indeed overtasked, but the magistrate felt compelled to fine the ring-leaders to discourage any future uprising.
 The Koronivia revolt was the first (and also the last) major organised protest movement among the Indian workers in Fiji.[73] The extent to which the labourers, coming from such diverse social backgrounds, had managed to


-----

##### present a united front was, indeed, surprising. During the course of investigation, it was found that there was a fund in Rewa, to which voluntary subscriptions were paid, and which was used to pay fines inflicted on the Indians, for a range of convictions including desertion, absence from work and non-completion of tasks.[74] The free Indians, settled around Suva also made their contribution and sometimes illegally harboured deserters. All this caused grave anxiety among the planters who complained to the government that unless the growing Indian insubordination was controlled immediately, the economy, already in a depressed state, would collapse. Inspector Carruthers raised the issue of law and order and argued that the strike represented ‘a growing disregard for the power and punishment of the law, as well as for the penalty of punishment, ’[75] and asked for greater control over the labourers. Thurston responded to their request for tough action, and passed what would be among the hardest labour legislations ever in Fiji’s history;[76] the Fiji Times called it ‘an enactment positively unique in the history of Fiji (i.e.) an Ordinance framed in the interest of the employers, ’[77]
 and Edward Wingfield in the Colonial Office described it as ‘Draconian’.[78]
 Penalties for absence from work and for incomplete or unsatisfactorily performed tasks were stiffened. Any labourer convicted thrice for absence from work on a plantation could be imprisoned with hard labour for six months, without the option of a fine. It was even made illegal, for reasons unknown, for immigrants to smoke or carry or use fire in any part of the plantation except the lines. But the most repressive part of the ordinance concerned strikes. Section 5 stated.

 It shall not be lawful for any number of immigrants exceeding five employed upon the same plantation to absent themselves from their employment without obtaining leave for the purpose or on pretence of laying a complaint against their employer or overseers and any immigrants absenting themselves contrary to the provisions of this section shall on conviction thereof before a Stipendiary Magistrate be liable to a fine not exceeding two pounds or to imprisonment with hard labour for any period not exceeding two months.

 The immigrants had good reason for going to lay a complaint in a large group, for that prevented the employers from identifying the so-called ringleaders and singling them out for prosecution. Moreover, there was a


-----

##### greater chance of being given a quick hearing by officials if immigrants presented themselves in large numbers. But the Ordinance went further; section 11 required that all fines imposed by the Stipendiary Magistrates should be paid within forty eight hours, failing which the alternative sentence of imprisonment was to be carried out. This was aimed, presumably, at preventing the indentured immigrants from the Rewa and Navua areas from travelling to Suva and seeking the financial assistance of their free compatriots. Given the straitened circumstances in which most of them were, it was unlikely that the labourers themselves could pay the fine on their own. Hence, for many, imprisonment was the only alternative. And when in jail, the immigrants not only lost their pay, but also had their indenture extended by the number of days they were absent from work.
 Thurston’s motives in enacting the ordinance are not difficult to determine, nor for that matter are the planters’ in asking for one. It is possible that there were habitual idlers and others who feigned illness or deliberately did not complete their tasks to protest against the system.[79] Yet, the overwhelming bulk of the evidence, unearthed by scrupulous officials, tended to substantiate the labourers’ complaints of overtasking, underpay and rough treatment from the overseers. Thurston’s actions, it can be argued, dealt more with the symptoms rather than the causes of the problems of indentured labourers. Perhaps this was only to be expected, for indenture was primarily a system of coercive labour.
 Apart from problems directly related to the regulation of work, there were others which the immigrants faced in their daily lives. Family life, for example, was unstable and subject to various kinds of pressures. Closed, crowded auarters in the lines did not provide privacy, as married couples lived next to single immigrants. The rooms were ten feet by seven feet and after 1908, ten feet by twelve feet, usually in a barrack called line, of sixteen rooms, eight on each side, and separated by a narrow passage-way. Gillion has admirably captured the atmosphere of a labourer’s room 
 The rooms had doors but no windows, and for ventilation (but not privacy) the partitions were not carried to the ceiling but were topped with wire-netting. There was no floor, except that made by the immigrants themselves out of cow-dung and clay, as in India. With three bunks, and firewood, field tools, cooking utencils (sic) and wet clothes cluttered about, smoke, soot, spilt food, flies and mosquitoes, perhaps fowls, or a


-----

##### dog as a precaution against theft, and until separate kitchens were required in 1908, a fire-place as well, living conditions were neither comfortable nor sanitary. Above all, there was no privacy for family life.[80]

 What privacy there was, depended upon the goodwill and the understanding of others around, values which were in short supply in the lines.
 Further difficulties arose when two immigrants, with different dates of expiry of indenture, intended to get married. CSR refused consent and for sometime magistrates refused to sanction such marriages.[81] Indeed, CSR even asked that its consent be sought before any marriages could take place on its plantations. Foster argued that in principle marriages should be independent of the permission of the employer, a view which Thurston fortunately shared.[82] But CSR had its way when the question of marriage between a free migrant and an indentured labourer arose. Although it could not stop it, CSR stipulated that its permission must be sought before a free migrant could visit his or her spouse on its plantations. The Attorney General agreed with CSR and ruled that any employer has the right to keep any ‘undesirable’ person away from his property.[82]$$$ Thus, Jaijai Singh was fined five shillings and six pence for visiting his indentured wife in a Labasa line.[84]
 However, a more serious problem was the paucity of Indian women, one which was made all the more difficult in view of the apparent reluctance on the part of Indian males to marry women of other races.[85] The Government of India stipulated that there should be forty females to every hundred males in the emigrating population. The reason for the choice of this figure is not known, though clearly it was an improvement on the situation that existed in the 1860s, or in contrast to Mauritius where only thirty three females were required to migrate for every hundred males. In the case of Fiji the 40:100 formula was closely adhered to.[86] However, the law did not stipulate the presence of forty females to every hundred males on the plantations, which led to serious problems. The women were exposed to the solicitations of young, unmarried men, and many were not averse to taking advantage of scarcity of their gender. The presence of traditional social values and codes of behaviour in muted and fragmented form, encouraged what officials described as ‘immorality’. A wife was difficult to get and in some


-----

##### circumstances even more difficult to keep. When husbands sensed infidelity on the part of their wives, described by the Agent-General in his report of 1902, as ‘unstable and mercenary’, they took to the handiest and quickest recourse available, the ever-ready cane knife. Between 1885 and 1920, there were altogether two hundred and thirty cases of murder and most of these were murders of women on account of’sexual jealousy’ to use the official term. Thus between 1890 and 1919 (when figures are differentiated by gender), sixty eight indentured women were murdered as against twenty eight men. Sometimes, however, the aggrieved husband would ‘brood over his wrongs and nurse his wrath’ and in the end commit suicide, an act that is alien to traditional Hindu society.[87] The statistics are revealing, as Table 5.4 shows.

 Table 5.4: Suicide Among Fiji Indians in the Indenture Period

 It is obvious that there were more suicides among the indentured Indians than their free counterparts; the reason for the sharp difference between the two groups needs no comment. In the indentured population itself, the majority of the suicides were committed by males rather than by females. The officials interpreted this trend as vindication of their’sexual jealousy’ arguments, which is persuasive. It may also be, however, that more males took their own lives because their work was heavier and more demanding, and failure to perform the allocated tasks involved a loss of self-respect in their own eyes as well as in the community. Perhaps the pressure led to


-----

##### suicides. It may be noted, too, that there was a gradual increase in the number of suicides committed over the years. Part of this was undoubtedly a result of the increase in the Indian population in the colony, but there were other factors. The large increase after the turn of the century was related to the arrival of people of South Indian origin who found much cultural prejudice and discrimination from their North Indian colleagues and were therefore prone to’suicide tendencies’.[88] However, there may also be a relationship between the increase (especially in the 1890s) in the incidence of suicide and the repressive labour legislation which prevented the articulation of grievance on the part of at least some workers who were then pushed to take their own lives.
 Death through murder, suicide and accidents constituted, on the whole, a relatively small part of the total mortality among the Indians, the largest cause, by far, was disease. Diarrhoea and dysentery, together, were the biggest killers. The mortality rates were very high in the 1880s: five per cent in 1884, and five and a half per cent in 1886; the 1890s were slightly, though not much better, the average being about three per cent. After the turn of the century they declined gradually.[89] However, while adult mortality rates declined, infant mortality remained a problem, and was especially high during the 1890s. Thus, in 1896, it was twenty per cent, in 1897 twenty-one per cent and the following year seventeen per cent. Bronchitis, broncho- pneumonia and malnutrition were the biggest and most dreaded killers of children, and they took a heavy toll especially among the children of poor people.[90] The causes of high infant mortality were the subject of heated discussion. CSR officials maintained that it was the result of Indian mothers’ ‘deliberate neglect of their children in order to obtain time off work’.[91] Dr Bolton Corney, acting Agent-General of Immigration in 1889, too, blamed mothers, but this time for failing to report early the illness of their children.[92]
 He argued that pressure of work on the mother was unrelated to infant mortality, but conceded that an insufficient supply of milk was probably the main cause. Dr Hirsche, the Chief Medical Officer, however, disagreed with the view that children died as a result of carelessness on their parents’ part; on the contrary, he stated, Indians were ‘fond and careful parents and they do their best to rear their children’.[93] He placed a part of the blame on CSR. The indentured women were given maternity leave of up to two months before birth and two to three months after, but during this period the employer did not provide either rations or milk. The malnutrition and improper feeding


-----

##### which usually followed, Hirsche argued, was directly related to the high mortality rates. Furthermore the pattern of work on the plantation required the mothers to take their children with them and thus unwittingly expose them to the ‘inclemency of the weather’. In a memorable passage, he captured vividly the drudgery and joylessness of the labourers’ lives which were ultimately related to the problem of infant mortality:

 Here we find little or none of what the coolie reckons comforts. The pair have to be up at grey dawn every morning save Sundays and very shortly trudge off a long way to their work in any kind of weather and if they have suckling infant it must be taken too as it cannot be left with the usual old woman who looks after a few of the older children while their parents are at work. An employer often complains that the women suckle their infants too long and that they could be left behind in the lines much sooner than is usually done. These gentlemen forget that these people have no other means of providing suitable nourishment for their children.[94]

 Clearly, then, girmit was a grim experience, a traumatic interlude in the lives of the indentured labourers who had left their homes in search of quick and easy fortune. The punitive legislations, the powerful control of CSR and other planters, the uncaring attitude especially in the 1880s and the 1890s, of an economy-conscious government, all compounded the problems of the indentured labourers. It also meant, in a fundamental sense, the fragmentation of the girmitiyas’ old world, whose values of hierarchy, honour, caste consciousness, corporate brotherhood, all gradually lost meaning in the process of migration, first in the crowded depots of Matiabruj, Calcutta and then in the confined cabins of the immigrant ships. The plantation, of course, was the ultimate leveller of hierarchy, reducing all to the status of ‘coolie’.
 However, to leave the story of indenture there would be both historically inaccurate and also unfair to the legacy the girmitiyas bequeathed to their descendants. It would be untrue to say that all the girmitiyas were brutalised. There were many who did well, if the amount they deposited in the bank is any indication. In 1885, for example, 106 indentured migrants deposited in the fixed deposit of the Bank of New Zealand £3470; in 1886, 136 had managed to save £3753 and in 1887, 178 deposited £5077.[95] The identity of those who managed to keep aside small sums from the daily pittance they


-----

##### received is not known. Perhaps some were sirdars who acquired fortunes through unscrupulousness and extortion. But it is equally possible that the majority were simple folks who did their day’s work and were fortunate in having good overseers and sirdars. Many even managed to repatriate small amounts to their kinsmen in India, while many returnees took their savings with them.
 It should be noted, too, that most of the indentured labourers after fulfilling their mandatory five year indenture on the plantations remained in Fiji. Of these few re-indentured for service despite various inducements that were offered; in 1896 only 43 or 9.6 percent did so.[96] Many preferred, instead, to set up on their own, initially on land leased from planters or CSR contractors. They tried their hand at many things - market gardening, banana cultivation and even poultry farming, though the majority turned to sugar cane farming. CSR encouraged this, and Indians were given land On which we [CSR] cannot grow cane at anything like the price at which this can be purchased from the coolies’.[97] The Indians applied themselves to the task of growing cane with energy and determination: in 1894 in Navua, they produced 1, 700 tons, in 1889, 18, 800 tons and in 1901, 32, 500 tons.[98] The settlement scheme proved, by and large, a success and contributed gradually to the improving economic position of the free migrants. But agriculture or other land-based activities, were not the only occupations that free Indians took up. In fact from the start, they showed a tendency to move into professional vocations. An indication of this in the early years is provided in Table 5.5.

 Table 5.5: Licence Granted to Free Indians in Fiji, 1887-1890


-----

##### In the next three decades further growth and diversification took place as the indentured labourers left the plantations to join their free compatriots. Agriculture remained their main source of livelihood, though with the gradual evolution of small market towns, commercial and industrial occupations began to offer possibilities of lucrative employment.[99]
 The size of the free population increased remarkably over the years. In 1891, of 7, 988 Indians in Fiji, 3567 were free; in 1901 out of 18, 425, 11, 392 were free and in 1911, out of 44, 220, 29, 758.[100] The growth of a free Indian society was an important development. If givmit can be described as the process of fragmentation, then the free society represented the process of re-constitution. It offered hope and inspiration to those still in bondage on the plantations by reminding them of the transience of their sojourn there, and of the possibilities for development that awaited to be exploited. The free immigrants began slowly to reconstitute the fragmented pieces from the cultural debris of indenture and tried to fashion in their new home a world from a remembered past. And in the affairs of that world, social conformity and divine preordination would count for less than individual enterprise and success.

 SOUTH INDIAN LABOUR IN MALAYA, 1840-1920: ASYLUM STABILITY AND INVOLUTION

 Ravindra K. Jain

##### Among the many streams of labour migration from India to the other British colonies beginning in the nineteenth century, the Malayan pattern showed one distinctive feature.[1] Whereas all the other colonies lay at a considerable distance from India, Indian emigrants to this territory were crossing the sea into their own geographical neighbourhood. Related to this spatial proximity was an ancient tradition of Indian ‘colonisation’ of the eastern part of Malay Peninsula from the second century A.D. onwards as well as almost unbroken sea-borne mercantile intercourse between the two countries. Set against this history and tradition, the Indian labour migration to Malaya in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries represents a momentous historic discontinuity which is explicable only in the politico- economic framework of European imperialist expansion and British colonial rule. This common framework integrates the dual focus on Malaya and India in this paper during the period 1840-1920. The chief characteristics of Indian labour recruitment to Malaya will be delineated both in the aspects of emigration and immigration. This will be followed by an account of the settlement of immigrant labour in the plantation setting of Malaya with comparative and supplementary information on the labourers’ home villages in South India. The processes of recruitment and settlement can be conveniently divided into two historical phases. The first phase (c. 1840-1910) is coeval with the period of the indentured system and the second phase (1910-1938) with that of the ‘kangany’ system of immigration of Indian labour to Malaya. Both were forms of assisted labour migration; there existed also the socalled ‘free’ or ‘independent’ migrant pattern. Indian labourers migrating under all these systems were recruited. The fourth category consisted of non-recruited assisted labourers. Finally, there was the distinction between labour migration of all types and the non-labour movement of professional and commercial people as well as clerks and


-----

##### technicians.[2] This chapter will focus predominantly on the migration and settlement of indentured and ‘kangany’ labour. The sources of data for the first phase are the extant published works on the subject. For the second phase, these sources are supplemented by empirical data from my field- work in 1961-62 on Pal Melayu.[3] Finally the ‘involution’ of Indian social structure which emerged from the process of stabilisation of labour on Malayan plantations by the 1920s will be examined.
 Recent historical scholarship has established that the constraints of colonial economics were paramount in determining the regulated flow of Indian labour overseas during the onset and consolidation of the British empire. Emigration from India and immigration into Malaya in this period were the two sides of the same coin, namely the imperatives of colonial mercantile capitalist exploitation, and British imperialism. Writing about the twin exports of rice and labour from Tanjore in southeastern India, Kathleen Gough remarks:

 In the hundred years from 1830-1930, Tanjore was one of the main districts supplying labour to the plantations of South India, Ceylon, Burma, Malaya, Mauritius and (in small numbers) the West Indies. Since these labourers were paid only trivial pocket money in addition to their sustenance, and since the money from Tanjore’s grain exports went mainly to pay the revenue, this means that Tanjore was in effect raising labourers free of charge for the plantations and by its exports, feeding them for little or no return.[4]

 Even the earliest recorded labour migration from India to Malaya seems to have taken place in response to the colonialists’ requirement of cheap servile labour. The establishment of a British port at Penang in 1786 was soon followed by the growth of an Indian colony. in 1787, Light suggested the Governor General-in-Council in India should send him a supply of 100 coolies ‘as the price of labour in Penang was enormous’. This request was not met but a similar proposal shortly thereafter for a supply of ‘artificers’ was granted and a group of twenty-five Bombay artificers landed in Penang in July 1787.[5] Writing in 1794, Light referred specifically to the Tamil population (called ‘Chuliahs’ or ‘Klings’) in Penang comprising ‘coolies’ and shopkeepers, and numbering about one thousand. According to him the majority were only sojourners who ‘by traffic and various kinds of labour

He added the revealing comment that ‘these are rather a drain upon the stock of the Island, but as they are subjects of the Company, it ultimately tends to the general good’.[6] Apparently, the recognition of profits to be derived from mastery over the human resources of Pax Britannica had dawned early in the official mind. It presaged their control, regulated distribution and deployment as cheap labour in colonial territories during the following century. The abject cheapness of Indian labour and its value for the European planter as a counterpoise to the Chinese was noted by J. Low in Penang in 1835:

 It is, however, undoubtedly the interest of the agriculturists to encourage all these classes [Chinese, Chuliah and Malay labour]; at the same time, specially guarding against the monopolising spirit of the Chinese, and an increase beyond the present rate of daily labour, by affording to the Chuliahs such hire as may induce them to resort, as they have done, to the Island ... No class of men can here subsist on less than a Chuliah can....[7]

 With these resources of cheap human labour, the colonial authority started ‘a trade designed to... maintain the plantations’.[8]
 The period from the mid 1840s to 1910 is characterised by the indentured immigration of Indian labour recruited to work on Malayan plantations. The earliest employers were the European owners of sugar, tapioca and coconut estates in Penang and Port Wellesley. Most specifically, however, it was in the sugar industry that this labour was used. The mode of sugarcane cultivation dictated specific labour requirements: it needed ‘at least one unit of Indian labour per acre’ compared with the work on coffee, pepper and gambier estates. Sugar cultivation also required a large steady and disciplined workforce, which could only be ensured by resort to long-term contracts. in several noteworthy respects the rialayan sugar plantations owed their origin to those of Mauritius and British Guiana. Not only did the cane planted come from those territories but, more importantly, the planters had learnt the industry there. There the sugar plantations operated with an African slave labour force until the passing of the Emancipation Bill of 1833. Moreover indentured labour as ‘a new system of slavery’ was perfected in these areas in order to replace the former slaves with Indians.


-----

##### (See Chapters 2 and 4.) Indeed, there is some evidence that in Mauritius where the slaves became apprentices as late as 1 February 1835 as many as one seventh of the ‘slaves’ were already from South India.[9] The sugar planters of Penang and Province Wellesley were, therefore, already old hands when it came to dealing with the bonded South Indian labour on the estates. It is hardly surprising that until the end of the century they remained staunch champions of the indenture system.
 The indentured system acquired a questionable respectability since it bound the labourer to his/her employer by a contract and for a limited period only. Yet, as far as the South Indian labourer was concerned, the ‘contract’ was a farce. The penal sanctions it contained deprived the labourer of any personal freedom for an extended period of time. Its fictional nature was further highlighted as emigration under this system was the direct result of ignorance on the part of the labourer and coercion or fraud on the part of the employer or his agent. Whilst the completion of the contract may have implied the acquisition of the status of free worker, it also led to reindenture or a return to India. As K.S. Sandhu states:

 Naturally many an employer undertook to maintain his workers at as small a cost as possible, to work them as hard as possible, and to keep them on the job as regularly as possible. At the end of the indenture, he tried to renew the agreement for another stretch if the worker was still productive, or to get rid of him if he was not.[10]

 In contrast to its operation in other colonies at about the same time, the indentured system in Malaya presented a few distinctive mostly unfavourable features. First, whilst labourers elsewhere in the British Empire were recruited by state regulated agencies and made available to employers as indentured servants, in Malaya recruitment was conducted by speculators or the employers themselves, either through their own or private agents in India. The recruitment of Pacific Islanders for Australia followed this pattern. (See Chapter 8.) Secondly, the period of contracts in Malaya varied between one and three years compared to five years elsewhere. Seemingly this offered an improvement, but the advantage was more than offset by another difference. Whereas the emigrant to the sugar colonies of Fiji, Mauritius and the West Indies did not have to pay for his/her recruitment and passage expenses, compatriots in Malaya had to pay back

##### all advances received as well as the cost of passage. Finally, until the 1870s migration to Malaya was entirely free of any regulations other than those introduced in 1857 and 1859 to control overcrowding on ships. In contrast, movement to the distant colonies was strictly regulated almost from its inception. (See Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5.)
 It has been estimated that between 1844 and 1910, some 250, 000 indentured Indian labourers entered Malaya. This figure also includes estimates of labour migrating on verbal contracts. Indentured migration thus formed some 13 per cent of the assisted labour, 9 per cent of the total labour and nearly 6 per cent of the whole Indian immigration into Malaya up to 1957.[11] With the exception of a few hundred labourers from Bengal, indentured migration to Malaya was essentially a South Indian phenomenon. One reason was that a number of North Indians who were tried as indentured labourers proved ‘troublesome’, complaining of conditions of service and refusing to work. Also, the Indian government refused to sanction indentured emigration from any part of India other than Madras. Within this province, the emigrants, at least those leaving under government supervision, were mainly drawn from the districts of Tanjore, Trichinopoly, Madras and occasionally Salem and Coimbatore. Up to the 1870s ‘coolie’ trade from the ports of Negapatam and Madras and secondarily from Karaikal, Pondicherry, Cuddalore, Porto Novo and Nagore appears to have been carried on by Indians themselves employing Indian- owned sailing ships. Subsequently, as in the other colonies, the monopoly over shipping, now converted to steam, was captured by Europeans. The majority of indentured labourers disembarked at Penang and were absorbed by the sugar estates in Province Wellesley (60 per cent) and Penang (20 per cent) and by coffee estates in Negeri Sembilan. The average annual number of arrivals of indentured servants in Malaya (2, 700 on a conservative estimate) gives little idea of the considerable fluctuation from year to year, influenced more by such factors as bad harvests and catastrophes in India rather than the conditions or demand in Malaya. The year 1900 saw the highest number of arrivals - 9, 174 indentured emigrants and 30, 752 ‘non- regulated’ emigrants i.e. those taken away by labour agents or even proceeding on their own. This large exodus was in a large measure related to the heavy demand in Malaya.[12]
 There are no reliable estimates of the number of emigrants returning to India after completion of their term(s) of indenture in Malaya. The average


-----

##### length of stay in Malaya of Chinese, Indian and Javanese immigrant labourers was estimated to be from two to three years.[13] The Annual Report on Emigration from Madras, 1900-1, giving figures for the highest ever exodus from Madras up to that date also stated that over a ten year period, 82 per cent of the emigrants came back to their home.[14] By and large the residence of Indian labour immigrants in Malaya at this time was both temporary and relatively short. The absence of family migration and, therefore an Imbalanced sex-ratio among the Indian labour migrants throughout the nineteenth century, contributed to this.[15] Recruitment of single or married males, unaccompanied by their wives or children, was at a premium. The recruiter (maistry) received ten rupees plus all contingent expenses a head for every adult he engaged. The migration pattern consisted predominantly of adult males, generally between the ages of fifteen and forty-five, the proportion of women and children being 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. This was partly because, unlike in the case of the other more distant colonies where the Government of India, anxious to promote normal family life and minimise the evils associated with a large disproportion of the sexes, insisted that 25-50 per cent of the emigrants were female, there was no such stipulation in the case of Malaya. This is reflected in the 1891 Census, when there were eighteen females per one thousand Indian males.[16]
 Conditions for the shipment and plantation-settlement of the ‘merchandise’ comprising predominantly adult male emigrants were by all accounts appalling during the indentured period. Even though the Indian Passenger Acts of 1857 and 1859 were passed specifically to check the abuse of overcrowding of ships, the following extract from the diary of an assistant Superintendent of Police, Madras, published in the Police Weekly Circular (Madras), dated 4 February 1865 is revealing - ‘This morning I accompanied the Master Attendant on Board one of those cooly traders waiting to start for the Straits. It was a beastly sight, coolies crowded together like beasts’.[17] European planters of the period seem to have taken full advantage of the lack of family migration among labourers by overcrowding them in ‘coolie’ lines and mixing the sexes indiscriminately. These arrangements, devised with a keen eye to minimising labour costs, were rationalised in terms of the alleged habits and customs of the people 

-----

##### Some of the emigrants bring their wives and children with them, but the greater number are single men...It is the custom of these people to form themselves into messes at the houses of the married men, the wives cooking and receiving a small fee for the service.[18]

 A contemporary journal noted that:

 Coolies lines, each room 12 ft. by 12 ft. can be built for dollars 25 to dollars 30 a room. Double lines - i.e., lines two rooms broad each facing on to a fixed feet verandah - will be found much more economical than the long single lines, besides being dearer to the heart of gregarious coolie. Not more than six coolies should be put into each room, but the planter need have no apprehensions on the subject of mixing the sexes as the Tamil coolie is most philosophical in this respect, a young unmarried woman not objecting in the least to reside with a family or even to sharing her quarters, if necessary, with quite a number of the opposite sex.[19]

 These features of Indian labour migration and settlement during the indenture phase indicate the relative impermanence and instability of the early labouring community on Malayan plantations. In the wider context of colonial rule in India and Malaya, however, it may be noted that this lack of indigenous or grass-roots authority and patronage in the transplanted community was not regulated by government ‘protection’ policies until the 1870s. In this respect therefore Malaya stood in contrast to the more distant colonies importing Indian labour. Even after the Straits Settlements Ordinance No. 1 of 1876 (called the Indian Immigrants Protection Ordinance) and Indian Act No. 5 of 1877 creating respectively the offices of an Emigrant Agent at each of the Indian ports of emigration and of a Protector of Emigrants, there were no material improvements which could encourage the formation of a stable migrant labour community in Malaya. The discourse in the government documents of the period is couched solely in the language of “abuses’ and ‘reforms’ of the indenture system, but it by- passes any perceptive commentary on the under-life of the institution of migration and settlement which vitally affected actual conditions.
 From the labourers’ vantage point, there were major deficiencies in the indenture system. First, throughout its operation, whether the contract was


-----

##### entered into in India or in Malaya (as after the Indian Immigration Ordinance of 1884), the labourer had to pay back all advances received and the cost of his/her passage. Thus he/she began life in Malaya under debt. While the amount was specified in the written indenture contracts it was capable of being manipulated and increased to the point of non-repayability in cases of verbal contracts. The labourer’s ability to repay, even in the former category, was severely constrained by the heavy curtailment of working days, and hence wages, on account of sickness, enforced stoppages by the management as punishment for trivial offences, the necessity of being away from work if summoned by a Court following a complaint by the manager, or due to actual imprisonment following the Court’s decision. All this was related to another serious disability which labourers with written contracts suffered. They faced a criminal liability for the most trivial breaches of the contracts in place of the civil liability which normally attached to such lapses. They could be liable to imprisonment with hard labour, ‘not only for fraud, not only for deception, but for negligence, for carelessness and...for even an impertinent word or gesture to the manager or his overseers’.[20] Another archaic and repressive feature of the system until the passage of the Labour Contracts Ordinance of 1882 was that a ‘joint and several’ contract was customary; under this, all the labourers of a gang signed a contract rendering each of them liable for the default of any of the others - a system ‘capable of very inhuman application, even to the making one man in a hundred work out the defaults of ninety-nine absconders’. Furthermore, the legislation enacted to regulate and standardise work conditions for the labourers retained other anachronisms. As the Ordinance 1 of 1876 stated that:

 The obligation to provide on holidays for the care of animals, the cleaning of machinery and such other attention to machinery as may be necessary for maintaining it in a condition for the resumption of work, the cleaning of premises for sanitary purposes... should not be considered as work under this Ordinance.

 As late as 1910, estate labourers seem to have been paid wages not per diem but on task work basis.[21]
 Wages were barely sufficient to keep the labourer alive. This can be illustrated by the controversy that raged between a planter, Mr Lamb, and


-----

##### the Principal Medical Officer (hereafter PMO) of the Straits Settlements. Lamb calculated that in 1879 the pay of a new fully employed ‘coolie’ on a Malayan estate amounted to $3.60 for a month of thirty days. Of that sum, $1.00 was deducted for his/her passage money, leaving $2.60 available for living expenses. Deducting from this $1.20 as the monthly cost of rice consumed by an average working person, Lamb argued that the ‘coolie’ was left with $1.40 a month for ‘extras’. The PMO retorted that these were essentials; for they included not only items of food such as vegetables, spices, cookingoil etc., but also clothing and transportation. Furthermore, a labourer with unemployed dependents had more than one mouth to feed out of his/her wage. But the crunch of the matter lay in whether or not the labourer was at all left with a balance of $1.40. ‘It is more likely’, wrote the PMO,

 ...the new cooly [sic] has nothing at all left from his pay at the end of the month and is probably in debt, with no surplus to buy anything with. He gets victimised right and left by the older hands on the estate and by the Tindals, becomes entangled in debt and is beset with troubles on all sides, and any planter will tell you who sees to paying his coolies himself that as a matter of fact this $1.40, as a rule, is not in his possession for five minutes before it is pounced upon by his creditors. There was also another practice... [that of]...cutting the coolies wages by 10 cents at a time for insufficient work or minor offences. This soon reduces the $1.40 to nil...[22]

 The grim consequences of this vicious cycle of poverty and exploitation became starkly visible where the estate manager, obliged to supply rice to indentured labourers, discharged his obligation by giving them the whole month’s supply at once. The PMO commented that:

 What happened as a result of this, that probably two-thirds of the recent arrivals have their monthly stock of rice finished before half of the month is over, having sold what they have not eaten for arrack, and thus starving, they eat all the rubbish they can lay their hands on, living the remainder of the time on unripe fruit, sugarcane, garbage and offal of all descriptions and if they do happen to get any rice their physical condition makes them too lazy to cook it, and they eat it in its raw state,

##### soon bringing themselves into a condition of poverty which, if death does not supervene, requires months to recover from; added to which they lie skulking about among the canes in all weather, sleep in the ditches at night, get wet, lose all interest in life, contracting bowel complaints which soon terminate their existence.

 The usual argument to justify these procedures was that the monthly ‘savings’ of $1.40 by the Indian ‘coolie’ in Malaya was ‘about three times the average income of an inhabitant of India’.[23] A full comparison of contemporary conditions for labour in Malaya and India is outside the scope of this chapter, but a brief background sketch of the emigrants’ circumstances in India will help to place in perspective the process and problems of their adaptation as indentured servants on Malayan plantations.
 Recent researches on late eighteenth and nineteenth century agrarian structure considered within the context of the political economy of the Tamil region of South India, especially Tanjore, will provide the main outlines of this background. Those regions supplying emigrants to Malaya were in the process of disintegrative social and economic changes caused by colonial wars, conquest, and consolidation. The introduction of ryotwari tenures replacing earlier forms of ‘joint’ structures of land ownership, control and cultivation in rural areas led to the emergence and consolidation of private property in land. The ever-increasing government demand for revenue, now exclusively in cash, led to the decline of the smaller mirasdars (traditional coowners of land in the village community) and of the payakars and the ulkudis (traditionally tenant-cultivators with hereditary rights of occupancy). Agricultural labourers (pannaiyal and padiyal) exchanged their customary ‘slave’ status in relation to the village community as a whole for crippling forms of debtbondage to individual landlords and moneylenders. The rural economy at the end of the nineteenth century had squarely fallen into the grip of big landlords and moneylenders to the detriment and destitution of the peasant and the agricultural labourer. In rural areas, the contradiction between the traditional grain-economy and the new cash-nexus was reflected in the unaltered relations of production characteristic of moribund agriculture gasping under the weight of predatory and peripheral capitalism. Throughout the nineteenth century the poorer sections of the peasantry were further afflicted by recurrent famines. Indeed as Dharma Kumar notes, ‘Except in the 1880’s, there was [in South


-----

##### India] no decade of the nineteenth century which was untouched by famines or scarcity, and there was no district unaffected’.[24]
 There has been considerable scholarly attention in the area of the recruitment of Indian villagers by guile, persuasion, force and, generally, under false pretences. The British Sub-Collector of Tanjore described the operation of the recruiting system from Negapatam, the chief port of departure as ‘a regularly organised system of kidnapping’.[25] While the adoption of unscrupulous methods of recruiting by the agents and sub- agents cannot be denied, there is incontrovertible evidence that British administrators of South Indian districts had, from an early date, an interest in painting the entire process of emigration in the blackest colours. The danger that emigration would reduce cultivation, and hence land revenues, engaged the government as early as 1840. Similarly the danger that it would raise domestic wages worried employers throughout the nineteenth century and later.[26] On the other hand, famines combined with the worsening poverty and unemployment during the period of consolidation of colonial rule in South India exerted pressure to push an ever-increasing number of agricultural labourers, ‘tenants’, and craftsmen from the rural areas into territories overseas. Arising out of these circumstances, the roots of the indentured system lay in South India itself. In the early nineteenth century there is evidence of pannaiyals having been forced into perpetual and hereditary bondage through a marriage-loan from their masters of, say twenty to thirty pagodas. At that time, there was no system whereby a labourer could discharge this loan by manual labour.[27] The only change that emanated from the mid-nineteenth century onwards was the provision of written contracts of indenture, which legally and temporally specified the term of labour against loan.[28] A system of voluntary debtbondage was already prevalent amongst agricultural labourers and lower peasantry in Tamil Nadu at a time when their members began signing contracts for indentured labour in Malaya (and even earlier for Sri Lanka). Thus, emigration to Malaya represented one major response by these groups to economic, social and natural upheavals endemic in the nineteenth century South Indian society.
 An examination of the political economy of South India allows the scholar to avoid the excesses of either a nationalistic or an apologetic colonialist interpretation when assessing the first phase of Indian labour

##### migration to Malaya. The nationalists have argued that agrestic serfdom and unprecedented increase in the number of agricultural labourers were the twin ‘creations’ of colonial rule in South India. Both these myths have been effectively demolished. Kathleen Gough demonstrates that ‘slavery’ was a pre-colonial Tamil institution, and Dharma Kumar’s work conclusively establishes that the number of agricultural labourers in the Madras Presidency remained more or less constant between the beginning and the end of the nineteenth century. On the other side, there is no real basis to support the rosy picture of those planters and officers in Malaya who wrote that the Tamilian’s sojourn to the archipelago meant a virtual trip to paradise - to the land of freedom and plenty. Indeed, though the late nineteenth century Tamil peasant may have genuinely looked upon emigration as a way out of poverty and destitution, he/she was definitely not aspiring to ‘freedom’. If at all, he/she was looking for substitute mechanisms of bonded security and patronage as the customary ones disintegrated. The crucial question is whether emigration to Malaya provided them, and certainly the bulk of evidence for the indentured phase suggests that it failed.
 The heavy mortality rate among immigrant Indian labourers and the high figures for desertions are two clear indices of their disillusionment. The death rate among the newcomers in some areas appears to have been as high as 80-90. per cent. Desertions were frequent, in spite of severe penalties if caught. For example, there were no less than 610 desertions out of a labour force of 1, 026 indentured immigrants on Gula Estate, Perak, alone in 1895.
 The indentured system, despite the penal provisions contained in the contract, failed to ensure a regular and reliable labour supply for Malayan plantations. Even as an instrument of exploitation it was anachronistic and counter-productive. Despite its last-ditch defence by the heavy-handed sugar planters of Penang, Port Wellesley and Perak right till the end of the nineteenth century, the indentured system was declining by the end of the 1910s. Perhaps the single most pernicious feature of the system was the condition of ‘anomie’ it created for the labourer. This was grasped by the more progressive planters experimenting with the crops of coffee and rubber. Although the successor to the indentured system was as much geared to ensuring the subordination of the South Indian labourer in


-----

##### Malaya, yet there was greater emphasis on family migration and the ensconsing of the migrant labourer in a protective cover.29
 Just as the Malayan sugar planters had adopted indentured labour for recruiting South Indian labour after experience of the West Indies and Mauritius, similarly the ‘kangany’ system was introduced in Malaya after its successful experimentation earlier on coffee and rubber estates in Sri Lanka. It had coexisted with indenture since the 1870s but its superior virtues for a steady supply of free labour impressed itself powerfully towards the end of the nineteenth century. Unlike the indentured servant, the ‘kangany’-recruited person had not signed a contract for a fixed period of service. The word ‘kangany’ is the widely used anglised form of the Tamil kankani (overseer or foreman). It is not however the term commonly used in southern India - it was reserved for labour migration experiences in Malaya and Sri Lanka from the 1870s until World War Two.
 In Pal Melayu, even the earliest Tamil workers seem to have been brought from their villages in the Madras Presidency by ‘kanganies’ rather than under indenture. Planters other than those running sugar plantations had two principal objections to recruiting indentured servants on estates. First and foremost, they were an unselected lot, poor in physique and unable to do outdoor work. Many were weavers, dhobies, ‘coolies’ and other workers with no experience in agriculture. Soon after arrival in Malaya, they became ‘hospital birds’ and were therefore a liability for the estate and the government. Also, their recruitment through agents and subagents in southern India was costly. The law enabled planters to recover from a servant within the three-year period of contract, less than half of the total amount spent on recruitment. But in every estate there was a large number of deserters from whom nothing could be recovered, and legal proceedings against them only increased labour costs.[30]
 As early as the 1890s, the so-called Ceylon system of ‘kangany’ recruitment was started among the planters in the Federated Malay States. An employer requiring labour would send a ‘kangany’ to India (giving him an advance for expenses) who would return with the worker and in due course repay the advance. In this early phase, the employer did not bother to find out the nature of the agreement between a ‘kangany’ and his recruits which enabled him to create debt-bondage. There was no guarantee either from the employers or the government ensuring the actual (as against the nominal) freedom of the labourers. At the turn of the century, those


-----

##### recruited by a ‘kangany’ began to receive free passage from India to Malaya. Nevertheless, there was still no system by which ‘kanganies’ could be prevented from recovering from the workers advances and expenses incurred before importation.
 To meet the increased demand of labourers in the first decade of the twentieth century, the whole system of labour recruitment needed an overhaul. Through the active collaboration of the planters and the government - the two principal employers of immigrant labour in Malaya - a pan-Malayan administrative machine regulated the supply and control of immigrant Indian labour. From 1907 to 1938 when the Government of India banned assisted emigration, the Indian Immigration Committee and the Indian Immigration Fund (hereinafter referred to as the Committee and the Fund) were the quasi-official legal instruments for the centralised control of labour supply on estates. The law establishing these instrumentalities was designed, first, to make each employer of Indian labourers bear a fair share of the cost of importing them; secondly, to prevent the deduction of large amounts from the wages of labourers to recoup recruiting expenses; thirdly, to attract more labourers by assuring a prospect of good wages free of excessive deductions; and fourthly, to prevent malpractices by recruiters and ‘kanganies’ in India. Under its provisions the cost of importing Indians was equitably distributed among employers by payment of assessments into the Fund. These were determined by the amount of work performed by Indians on each employer’s estate. The Fund covered the expenses for both ‘kangany’-recruited and nonrecruited assisted immigrants.
 The Fund was used in the initial stages for the train fares of emigrants and their dependents from their villages to the camps in Madras and Negapatam; food and medical attention of emigrants and their dependents awaiting shipments at the Indian camps; steamship passage from India to Malaya; quarantine charges in Malaya; transport charges from ports to places of employment; repatriation to India; payment of food and transport expenses to repatriates and their dependents from ports of disembarkation to their homes and villages in India.
 In order to recruit new labourers from India an employer had to obtain ‘kangany’ licenses from the Committee after stipulating that no deductions would be made from wages to offset importation expenses. Generally, ‘kanganies’ were licensed by the Deputy Collector of Labour, Malaya, at Penang and Port Swettenham, and all licences were required to be endorsed


-----

##### by the Agent of the Government of India. In India, the licenses were registered either at Madras or Negapatam. The number of recruits allowed to be recruited by each ‘kangany’ was limited to twenty, and the operations of the ‘kanganies’ were confined to the neighbourhood of their own villages. Before any recruit left his/her village he/she was brought by the ‘kangany’ before the village headman, who made sure that there was no objection to recruitment.
 The general procedure was that the ‘kangany’ obtained a small advance of 20 rupees against his commission from his employer’s financial agent at Madras and Negapatam. This commission could not exceed 10 rupees for each adult recruit - at least half of which was usually spent on the recruit and his family. The ‘kangany’ was refunded out of the Fund the cost of train fares of all persons accepted at the camps by the Emigration Commissioner for Malaya at Madras or by the Assistant Emigration Commissioner at Negapatam. Employers in Malaya, having paid recruiting commissions and in some cases the ‘kanganies’’ passages to India, were given a recruiting allowance from the Fund for each adult immigrant brought over, and this allowance was calculated so as to cover all these expenses. By increasing or decreasing the number of ‘kangany’ licenses and/or the amount of recruitment allowance the Committee could control the volume of immigrants.
 Besides ‘kangany’ recruits and indentured labourers, there was a third category of ‘local recruits’, consisting of formerly indentured workers from estates and their locally born children. According to a government Commission Report, a free ‘coolie’ was ‘well able to take care of himself’.[31] But it seems that independence and self-reliance were not precisely the virtues which planters in those days looked for in a labourer. Indeed, they remained vehement critics of the independent-minded-ness of labourers in the government works and attributed it to the system of local recruitment and indirect supervision. Only four years after the findings of the government commission came to light a planter wrote:

 Scarcely less desirable is the local recruit. He arrives here a humble- minded, quiet, almost naked savage, and in a few months time you see him walking along with a cheroot in his mouth, attired in a gaudy costume, with a hat on one end and a pair of shoes on the other, looking in at every liquor shop he passes and indulging in such amusements as


-----

##### pulling the patient Chinaman’s pigtail or driving a pair of bullocks as hard as he can urge the poor beasts on through the busiest part of the town. All this is due to this fact, that as an individual he is quite out of touch with his European employer who only knows him as one of his sub-contractor’s gang and who has probably never spoken to him since his arrival. On estates, the manager knows every coolie by name, pays him himself, supervises all his work in person and subjects him to the strictest discipline; but on the roads and railways where the coolies’ immediate boss is probably a native, himself well-schooled in all the devilries of his country, the result is that the coolie does everything in his power to imitate him and soon becomes a useless indisciplined blackguard.[32]

 This planter made several suggestions by which a regular labour supply might be assured, but for understandable reasons his grasp of the ‘kangany’ system as it subsequently developed in Malaya was imperfect. A ‘kangany’ on the estate became a kind of ‘native boss’. Yet the planter’s diagnosis of the local recruits’ unsuitability for estate work can be treated as an important datum for reconstructing the bases of relationship between ‘higher and lower participants’[33] in the earliest phase of the industrial subsystem of rubber estates like Pal Melayu. Subservience was considered an essential attribute in the labour force. Compared with other means of recruitment the ‘kangany’ system proved to be a satisfactory answer to the planters’ desire for a regular, cheap, and subservient labour force.
 Stenson has remarked that ‘the introduction of this government- controlled system of labour recruitment and employment was a political masterstroke’.[34] By the legal abolition of recruitment of indentured labour in 1910 and by relying upon ‘free’ labour brought into the country, the Malayan governments could claim quite convincingly that this was the most progressive system of labour supply in the British colonial world. The apparent stabilisation introduced into the ranks of Indian plantation labour in Malaya achieved a double purpose: on the one hand, vindication was provided to an organised system eminently acceptable as ‘progressive’ to the employers and the employed alike and, on the other hand, the social and other extra-economic burdens on the South Indian labourer in Malaya were effectively concealed. Because of the resolution of the former factors, ‘a rising tide of criticism prevented the revival of assisted labour migration to

##### Fiji after the First World War, and cut the link with Ceylon in 1923; the flow of labour to Malaya was little restricted until 1938’.[35] Indian political opinion concentrated upon criticising the manifest inequalities of flagrant racial discrimination in South Africa and Kenya, of indentured labour in Fiji, and of the ‘tundu’ system in Sri Lanka.[36]
 The concealment of the exploitation of South Indian labour lay in the fact that this reserve army, instrumental in the development of the Malayan jungle was not only cheap but eminently replaceable. The essentially conservative function of the incipient stabilisation of South Indian plantation labour in Malaya of the 1920s is demonstrated by the absence of abolition movements comparable to those in Fiji and Mauritius. The difficulties of obtaining and controlling north Indian labour was one factor which enabled the conversion from a plantation to a small-farmer leasehold system in Fiji.[37] in Mauritius there had been progressive decline in the percentage of Indians living on estate camps - 44 per cent in 1861, 28 per cent in 1871, 15 per cent in 1904 and 9 per cent in 1956.[38] in Malaya, as late as 1965 the percentage of labour in the gainfully occupied Indian population was approximately 60 per cent. Of these nearly 60 per cent were estate labourers, the majority of whom lived in labour-lines.[39]
 Lastly the social characteristics of the plantation community during the phase of stabilisation will be analysed. It may be possible to demonstrate the ‘involution’ of Indian social structure among the South Indian plantation labour in Malaya. The process is best analysed in terms of the sociology of caste.
 Although it is difficult to substantiate this claim statistically, there is reason to believe that under the more ‘protective’ ‘kangany’ system the proportion of non-Brahmin castes (of the middle order) increased among the immigrants. There is a slight difference of usage in the classification of castes lower than non-Brahmins as given in the Census of India, 1931, and that found on Pal Melayu.[40] According to the former source, the untouchable castes of paraiyan, chakkiliyan and pallan, are distinguished from a ‘conglomerate depressed caste’ called adi-dravida. On Pal Melayu all the castes below the non-Brahmins are grouped together as adi-dravida. Wiebe and Mariappen in 1978 reported that the distinction between the non- Brahmins and Adi-Dravidas on the estate studied by them is between Sudras and Harijans. in any case, it is a fair estimate that ‘almost all the

##### emigrants of the untouchable castes would have been landless labourers or serfs in differing degrees of servitude, and it is not surprising that they should have migrated in such numbers. But it is of interest that other agriculturalists from the higher castes, many of whom would have been land-owning cultivators, chose to migrate.’[41]
 Among the higher castes of emigrants mentioned in the 1931 Census report are the vellalan, koundan, ambalakaran, kallan, and vanniyan. Again, there is some difference in this respect on Pal Melayu. Those with the title Gounder or Koundan are included among the vanniar. The latter caste also included families having the titles Padyachee, Naioker, and Reddi. in 1962 the vanniar constituted 51.8 per cent of the total households (56 out of 108) on division I of Pal Melayu.
 There is some ethnographic information on the origin and currency of the generic term Vanniar. The traditional designation of castes in this category is said to have been palli, but the adoption of the term Vanniar with its associated mythology at the turn of the century indicated the aspiration of the groups concerned, to raise their status in regional caste hierarchies from menials (suara) to rulers and warriors (ksatriya) . Vanniar level of caste segmentation was relevant for the groups concerned for purposes of status upgrading or, more recently, political action but not connubium. The widest limits of endogamy were still defined by the sub-caste, the narrowest by the cross-relatives of the kindred (conta-k-karar) . The concept ‘caste-category’ is, therefore, a suitable sociological definition of the Vanniar phenomenon in the former Madras Presidency. On Pal Melayu, on the other hand, as defining the widest unit of endogamy for some non-Bramin kindreds, the name Vanniar may be regarded as the name of a caste.[42]
 The term palli, precursor of Vanniar, was the caste designation of certain economically unspecialised, mainly agricultural, and numerically large Tamil non-Brahmin groups in the northern and eastern districts of Madras Presidency. These groups were engaged in a wide spectrum of agricultural occupations, and the placement of palli among the ‘agricultural labour castes’ both at the beginning of the nineteenth century and its end is only partial.[43] The percentage among the palli of actual workers following traditional occupation was 18.6 per cent in 1871, 18.5 per cent in 1901 and 59.4 per cent in 1921. in 1871 and again in 1901 less than 20 per cent of the palli were actually agricultural labourers. The 1871 Census report, which


-----

##### stated that 70 per cent were ‘cultivators’ (as opposed to labourers and so on), remarked that

 a large proportion of the Vunnies [i.e. Vanniyans or Pallis] were abject slaves before the period of British administration, incapable of owning property, or of cultivating on their own account. Others were thieves and robbers by profession, and existed on plunder. A wonderful change must have taken place in the last century to bring more than two-thirds of them into the class of small farmers, or peasant proprietors.[44]

 Since few of the early reports on serfdom in the Tamil districts mention them it is unlikely that the Pallis were traditionally serfs. As to the attribution of former occupations such as robbery etc. to some Palli, this seems to be due to the fact that the two large castes of Kallan and the Maraver were included in the palli group in the 1871 Census. Thus the Census report was attempting a conjectural history of the Palli in the typical fashion of nineteenth century social evolutionism. Moreover the fluctuations in their numbers as agricultural labourers as between the 1871, 1901 and 1929 Censuses is partly a result of optical illusion. There is inconsistency and hence lack of comparability in the definition of caste as applied to the palli in these Censuses. At the same time, the category agricultural labourer does not have a uniform meaning ranging as It does from a caste occupation to a caste-free one and from hereditary serfdom through debt slavery to ‘free’ wage-labour. The Palli were a conglomerate of upwardly mobile agricultural castes.
 Changes in economic circumstances entailed in migration to and settlement on estates in Malaya offered greater opportunities to manoeuvre the groups and individuals in this category than to those in other castes more tightly integrated into local hierarchies.[45]
 On an estate like Pal Melayu, a more-or-less permanent nucleus of the families of immigrant Indian labour had come to be formed by the 1920s. The levelling process involving so many ascribed distinctions, which is an integral part of the Hindu caste system, was effected on the Malayan estates because of the common identity of all residents of the labour lines as a ‘ sub-proletariat’.[46] (See Chapters 4 and 5.) Yet it is instructive to note that, on account of differential skill in ‘line’ entrepreneurship among labourers on the estates - through participation of the same families in various petty

-----

##### capitalistic operations like the rotating-credit associations, with constant differential advantage - there grew up a novel mode of stratification in the labour lines. A distinction has to be made in these conditions between those labourers who not only worked for money but also knew how to make money work for them. The latter stratum can aptly be termed a ‘labour elite’. Caste distinctions as such had begun to decline by the 1920s but the resilience of kinship bonds in the form of ‘kindreds-around-kanganies’[47]
 remained a salient feature of labourers’ social structure. Despite the fact that initially the immigrant labourers were not only housed but also fed by the plantation authorities, the transformation of customary Tamil institutions of kinship and marriage in this overseas setting recall the structure of Sinhalese kindreds as ‘micro-castes’[48] it is a process which casts serious doubts concerning the characterisation of the discipline on Malayan estates as ‘military type’ and as ‘a prerequisite to the success of a system of European plantation agriculture ‘.[49] (See Chapter 8.) Festivals, modes of public worship and domestic rituals continued to derive their sanction and sanctity from a tradition deeprooted in the home-villages. It seems apt to characterise the process of social structural adaptation following the stabilisation of immigrant labour as involutionary. The notion of ‘involution’ has been utilised with great sophistication by C. Geertz in his analysis of agriculturists in the neighbouring country of Indonesia. Although he is concerned with a population of peasants rather than a rural proletariat, his overall perspective has a striking degree of applicability to the communities of South Indian plantation labour in Malaya. In explication of the concept of involution Geertz remarks:

 Perhaps the most trenchant phrase which has been coined to summarize what appears to have been the career of the Inner Indonesian village over the past century and a half is ‘the advance towards vagueness’. The peculiarly passive social changes experience which... rural society has been obliged to endure seems to have induced in it an indeterminateness which did not so much transform traditional patterns as elasticize them. Such flaccid indeterminateness is highly functional to a society, which is allowed to evade, absorb and adapt but not really allowed to change.[50]

 ‘KINGS’ IN BRASS CRESCENTS. DEFINING ABORIGINAL LABOUR PATTERNS IN COLONIAL QUEENSLAND

 Raymond Evans

##### ‘Slaves are always recruited from among persons menaced with death.’

 - Orlando Patterson[1]

 In the September-October 1891 copy of the British Anti-Slavery Reporter, there appeared a ‘Slave Map of Modern Australia’, purporting to show those areas of the continent where both ‘milder’ and ‘worst forms of Slavery’ were practiced.[2] Such accusations of chattel bondage in the Australian colonies were by no means new. Allegations of slavery in relation to Melanesian recruitment for, and indenture upon Queensland sugar estates and pastoral properties had commonly resounded from religious, humanitarian bodies in Britain, Australia and the Pacific Islands since the Queensland ‘Kanaka traffic’ had first been condemned as ‘a branch of the Peruvian slave trade’ in August 1863.[3] Indeed, local sensitivities over the issue of ‘slave hunting’ had only recently been enlivened by the Stanley, Hopeful and Ceara scandals of the mid-eighties, the cause célebre of the following abduction and murder trials and the consequent 1885 Royal Commission to Enquire into.Kidnapping in New Guinea Waters.[4]
 Yet the reproduced map in the Anti-Slavery Reporter made no reference to Melanesian indenture whatever. Instead, it depicted a broad swathe of the Australian mainland, encompassing most of western and northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and the coastal areas of Western Australia where, it alleged, the enslavement of Australian Aborigines was customary. The map, in turn, had been reprinted from The Black Police: A Story of Modern Australia (1890), a startling expose of Queensland’s

##### frontier relations by English journalist, Arthur J. Vogan. The account, Vegan assured his readers was ‘chiefly the result of my personal observations and experiences: the remainder are from perfectly reliable sources’, gathered during a tour of outback Queensland in 1888-9 while completing an assignment for the London Illustrated News.[5]
 Vogan’s work, aided by ongoing controversy over the activities of the Native Mounted Police and a lurid book-cover, depicting an Aboriginal woman being flogged by a native trooper reached a wide contemporary audience. The volume, he would later boast, was the ‘first Australian novel to have a third edition’.[6] in it, he relentlessly attacked the ‘rampant demon of cruelty and slavery’ which characterised colonial race relations - the frontier process of ‘exterminating sundry nests of human vermin’ on the one hand, whilst, on the other, ‘the “unpaid labour” of the blacks’ upon which the pastoral industry depended. Of the latter, he contended:

 One feels as if he had somehow descended into the slave countries of Mrs Beecher Stowe and the odd part of it is that its very existence is unknown in England, neither in Sydney, nor Brisbane to any great extent.[7]

 The buying and selling of Aboriginal children in frontier Queensland was instanced as ‘the custom of the place’, while adult blacks were depicted as ‘the poor wretches one sees forced to work by brutal squatters, carriers, “cockatoo” settlers, and others’.[8] Calling upon local press support, he quoted from an account in the Brisbane Courier of September 1888 which charged northern squatters, ‘the “grassdukes” and their subordinates with “murdering, abducting children for immoral purposes, and stockwhipping defenceless girls”‘. The report continued alarmingly:

 The Northern Miner asserts that this picture is not overdrawn, and that the atrocities mentioned have even been exceeded. It refers to squatters branding blacks, keeping harems of black gins and finding their slaughtering record no bar to advancement to high office in the State.[9]

 Vogan’s account, therefore, depended largely upon anger and sensationalism to make its point. Emotional outrage was its driving force and shocking expose its main rationale. Much like the missionary

##### pamphlets seeking to reveal the excesses of the Melanesian labour traffic, his work was basically polemical and political, intended to arouse a ground- swell of scandalised liberal consciences, locally and overseas, in order to abolish the Native Police force and to effect a humane reform of labour relations upon colonial pastoral properties. His work is thus part of that long tradition of humanitarian writings, emanating from Britain, the United States and the Pacific which indignantly identified ‘slavery’ with ‘atrocity’ and sought to end an abomination, worldwide. The moral didacticism of Vogan’s approach is well captured in his later pamphlet, The Case for the Aborigines. In it, Aborigines were shown as the ‘defenceless’ victims of ‘land-greedy’ pioneers, a ‘rough, conscienceless crowd’ who, save for some notable individual exceptions behaved en masse as ruthless ‘scoundrels’.[10]
 Thus, to Vogan and other liberal campaigners, slavery seemed a self- evident evil which, like murder required no further elucidation or definition. Such interactions as the ‘sale’ of human beings, forced labour and floggings, witnessed often at first-hand, seemed clear-cut and easily interpreted. Moral outrage rang through such accounts like a clarion call in a verbal battle to capture public opinion, waged between those who utilised the labour and those who abhorred its exploitation. In this confrontational atmosphere, little time or attention was paid to careful analyses, as propaganda, vituperation and censorship infused public discourse. As Vogan recalled in 1913:

 All I did (and it was little enough, God knows, but all I COULD dare to do)...is now forgotten ...My book was considered so ‘anti-Australian’ as exposing the atrocities being perpetrated... that I was anathema to all Australian papers but the Bulletin, the Brisbane Courier and the Northern Miner. I lost my position on the Australian press and had to give up writing altogether for some years.[11]

 Yet, without close attention to those factors which distinguished slave labour from other forms, such as indenture or wage-labour, the ‘slavery’ controversy degenerated into one of emotive charge and counter-charge, of hostile attack and sardonic defence, leading nowhere and, ultimately, accomplishing nothing. As Judith Wright notes of the reactions of her squatter forbears:


-----

##### The charge of using slave labour, occasionally brought against them by men of tender conscience and those still influenced by the principles of Exeter Hall and the Aborigines’ Protection Society, worried them not at all...The squatters pointed easily to the uncomfortable habit of Aborigines of deserting the stations at times of ceremonial; such unreliable workers could not be considered anything but free.[12]

 In subsequent historical discourse, the status of Aboriginal workers under the aegis of Australian colonialism has remained indefinite and obscure. For some time, Aboriginal labour was referred to as simply that - ‘Aboriginal labour’ without any attempt beyond an occasional vague reference to ‘helotry’ to define its nature precisely.[13] More recently, Frank Stevens in The Politics of Prejudice favourably quotes nineteenth century, descriptive sources which refer to ‘native labour...bordering on slavery’. He then goes on, however, to depict Aborigines succumbing to ‘a virtual state of peonage’.[14] On the other hand, Peter Biskup, in his Not Slaves, Not Citizens denies the accuracy of similar ‘species of slavery’ charges, whilst still referring to blacks as resembling ‘a peon class attached to white pastoral properties’. For good measure, he subsequently states:

 Ideally [sic], the relationship between a pastoralist and “his” aborigines was not unlike the contractual relationship between a European feudal lord and his serfs.[15]

 Stretching such loose analogies even further, Humphrey McQueen refers to ‘the initially classless Aborigines...being subjugated into capitalist, slave and even feudal modes’.[16]
 Clearly, the labels of helot, peon, serf, wage-labourer and slave cannot all be awkwardly hung upon the black worker, unless it can be shown that this entire range of precise labour forms was operative among oppressed indigenes across the Australian colonies. Yet, as John Rex and E.N. Francis define peonage, that labour system, with its recognised connection to land lease and subsistence farming can hardly be related successfully to the pattern of Aboriginal exploitation.[17] Similarly, Orlando Patterson, in defining ‘what is slavery’ points out the necessity to differentiate that institution from other ‘closely related forms of bondage, such as serfdom and helotage’. In an extended discussion, Patterson demonstrates five


-----

##### significant ways in which serfdom differs from slavery. The serf is not ‘totally powerless’, he writes, and does not arrive at his condition ‘as a substitute for death’. Unlike the slave, the serf is ‘capable of being a proprietor’ and even as an exploited worker is ‘nonetheless ... not alienated from the means of production’. Lastly, the serf has not been rendered a social isolate - an Outsider’ in an alien social order - but rather is ‘an integral member of his community and shares fully in its cultural and symbolic life’.[18] Such specifications cast serious doubt upon Biskup’s assertion that the Aboriginal employee is better viewed as serf than slave.
 Some way out of this maze of confused categorisations needs to be found and Patterson’s careful study of ‘Slavery and Slave Formations’ seems to provide a path. For his analysis, attempting both theoretical and empirical aspects of the problem can provide us with a fruitful methodology for examining frontier and post-frontier labour relations within an Australian colony. As Patterson indicates, the nature of the institution - in this case of white colonial employer to black colonised employees - must be precisely defined before the relation of the institution to the wider social order can be properly understood. Both nineteenth century polemicists and twentieth century historians have failed to undertake this necessary spadework, preferring to extrapolate instead upon the evil or beneficial effects of a vaguely defined institution for the black and white actors involved. But how should Aboriginal labour under white domination be defined? And to what extent does Patterson’s exploration of the ‘nature and inner dialectics of slavery’ help us with this problem?
 Aboriginal labour, like slavery is clearly a ‘relation of domination’. Yet, how closely does the powerlessness of the slave and of the indigenous worker approximate? As Patterson shows, quoting Marx, it is ‘the element of direct force’ which distinguishes slavery from wage labour. Force is applied as a vital pre-condition to the relationship, but also remains a ‘continuous part’ of that relationship.[19] Enough is now known empirically of Australian frontier relations to state confidently that an excess of force and compulsion had been the overriding relationship there between colonist and colonised. At its base, this pattern of excess was grounded, literally, upon the incomers’ ‘greed of country’ and the massive displacement or annihilation of that country’s inhabitants which this entailed. The Australian wool-broker, T.S. Mort recorded how in the mid-1850s he had ‘sat gloating over the squatters’ paradise that lay spread out before me’ as he approached

##### Mount Abundance in the Port Curtis district for the first time.[20] By the early 1860s, Noel Loos shows how, within six weeks of white penetration of the Bowen district, pastoralists with Native Police accompaniment had ‘taken up’ runs ‘in an unbroken line 350 miles inland’.[21] At the same time, herds of cattle and flocks of sheep were being raced towards an ‘ocean of plains’ in north-western Queensland in a land rush graphically described in the memoirs of squatter George Sutherland.[22]
 Sporadic though persistent Aboriginal resistance took its continuing toll upon colonists and livestock and Sutherland’s account is peppered with incidents detailing trouble with ‘niggers’. But the tide of pastoral expansion was unrelenting. Aboriginal society was broached and undermined at three imbricated levels - environmentally, structurally and physically. A vivid encapsulation of this onslaught is again provided by Sutherland’s account of a stampede of his thirst-maddened sheep to the shoreline of Lake Mary on the Herbert River:

 ...there was a terrible baa-ing and galloping...Fires were burning in scores right down to the water’s edge - a sure sign of a large camp of blacks. On rushed the sheep through fires, blacks and all other impediments to quench their thirst. The unfortunate niggers had a terrible time of it. To be roused out of their sleep at midnight by some 8, 000 sheep rushing madly and tumbling over them was chaos, was something demonical to the simple natives who never saw or heard of jumbucks before. Of course the whole tribe took up their beds quick, and ran. To this day, the Georgiana blacks have a corroboree indicating ‘the rush of sheep to water at night’.[23]

 Everywhere, throughout outback Queensland, Aboriginal social order was gradually crushed beneath the hooves of the grazing herd.

 Force, therefore, was invariably a necessary precondition which expelled Aborigines from traditional land usage and compelled them ‘by one means or another to work for the new proprietor’.[24] Indeed, the viscissitudes of frontier violence draw us much closer than this to a further prerequisite of the slave condition. For, as Patterson reveals, ‘the slave’s powerlessness... always originates as a substitute for death, usually violent death. Arche- typically, it is a substitute for death in war.’ This, he adds, is ‘...the most


-----

##### distinctive attribute’ of the slave’s status and plight.[25] To view Aborigines merely as victims perishing or acquiescing before superior power absolves the historian from properly regarding the frontier as a kind of warfront and those Aborigines surviving the conflict as either prisoners of war or a people defeated in combat. Slavery, as Patterson shows, arises in situations of ‘continuous, naked violence ’ and the recently rediscovered realities of widespread and prolonged Aboriginal resistance emphasise the ubiquity and escalation of such violence. Persistent violence, it now seems clear, lay at the hub of the interrelationship between black and white. Successful accommodatory attempts, eschewing such hostilities were rare. White settlers realistically depicted an inter-active spiral of conflict in which they and the blacks were caught as a situation of Open warfare’ upon ‘unrecorded battlefields’.[26] The Aboriginal worker and the vanquished survivor of such battles were one and the same. Exploited endurance upon the lands of the new proprietor was the substitute for violent death which the logic of the frontier struggle offered to the black man and woman.
 But not only was this labour form grounded in violence. Additionally, it was maintained by a continuity of violence - or, at least, the constant threat of it. As Patterson notes, the slave has the special quality of being:

 ...literally a person under sentence of death. The condition of slavery does not absolve or erase the prospect of death. Slavery is not a pardon; it is a conditional commutation; the execution is suspended only so long as the slave acquiesces in his powerlessness.[27]

 Accounts of frontier violence emphasise Native Police dispersals, sundry massacres, poisonings and so on, as well as the tribalised Aboriginal responses with spear, waddy and firestick. Less emphasis has been placed, however, upon the repercussions of these processes for detribalised Aboriginal survivors. In effect, even when they had passed across the frontierline, entering at the base of white society, the omnipresence of sudden death continued to permeate their subsequent life-chances. Force and violence continued both to surround and invest all their relationships with the dominant whites. The memoirs of R. McGregor Watson, owner of Gregory Downs station, south of Burketown provides a languid confession of the way in which black workers were obtained and controlled.

##### The first labourer recruited - a Kalkadoon tribesman whom Watson renamed ‘Drummer’ - was encountered at the brink of violent death. Watson recalls:

 This boy and his mate were caught by the Native Police on the Leichhardt and they were to be shot but luckily... one of us came on to the police just as they had shot Drummer’s mate, and he was told to walk out onto the plain to be shot...After a lot of argument, the Sub-Inspector handed the boy to us, but on condition that we took him out of the district... The reason given for wanting to kill these two blacks was because they knew a few words of English so were likely to teach the wild blacks some villiany...

 Just as peremptorily, some months later, it was decided that the time was right to find a wife for ‘Drummer’, and a woman, to be renamed ‘Louie’ was easily procured:

 ...we went down to the river...and found some gins in a lagoon getting water-lily roots and mussels. The poor things were so scared that they would not come out until they were nearly frozen or drowned. Well, we had a look through them and told Drummer to pick one but to try to get one with curly hair and small feet (as they are the most intelligent). Drummond chose one, put her on his horse behind him, and we all returned to the 20-mile camp...It was a great relief to us having these two blacks...She did our washing and sweeping and water-carrying and Drummer did the horse-hunting.

 Around these black workers, frontier violence continually acted as a catalyst to their compliance. Native Police patrols continued ‘slaughtering all the males they came across’. One day in 1884, after several ‘loud explosions’ were heard, a dozen frightened ‘black gins’ approached the homestead, waving branches. These were later joined by seven or eight black men and all were drafted into the station’s workforce. Watson comments:

 These blacks were very helpful to us and gave no trouble at all. We gave them names and pricked these names on little discs of tin and hung them round their necks and told them that if ever they were attacked by the

##### Native Police to show these discs, which would stop the police shooting them, but some of them were shot all the same, and others we kept on the Station. One of them was shot by a white cook we had when we were all away...We... found that the cook wanted Bob to lend him his gin. Bob objecting caused the trouble ... 28

 Watson’s guileless account candidly reveals the powerlessness of the Aboriginal work force as well as its expendability. The power of the white master is stressed as much in the bestowal of sanctuary, European names and tin discs as it is in the seizure of women and arbitrary control over life and death. Although the guise adopted in the white master’s recounting of events may appear ‘benevolent’, once its ideological loading is understood, the phrase ‘subordination by terror’29 hardly seems an overstatement in delineating the black worker’s position.
 An account prepared by a Brisbane Aboriginal social worker, Patrick S. Jerome upon his family’s collective memory of his great-grandfather’s initial contact with whites graphically emphasises this ordeal by terror and the omnipresence of death investing the experience. Jerome recalls how his grandfather would relate these events dynamically, ‘acting out and expressing’ all the emotions involved, utilising ‘facial and vocal expressions, postures and gestures’ to do so. These relayed emotions, Jerome notes, induced ‘a very high degree of stress within me personally, as it did in him’. The comprehensive recollection details an attack by mounted whites and native police, in the 1840s upon a group of some thirty Aborigines camped at a lagoon on the Darling Downs, upon land subsequently to become part of Warra station. ‘Imagine for a moment’, Jerome writes:

 ...the terror and confusion that developed when these strange monsters erupted from the surrounding bush. Imagine the effect on people whose very cultural laws...were based on spirituality and could only explain this phenomenon as malevolent spirits wreaking vengeance. Imagine the awe, terror and panic that followed...

 Jerome goes on to recount a dazed sense of unreality initially experienced by his ancestor, then a youth of twelve years undergoing initiation, as the attack began. Then ‘terror took over and he ran, but was ridden down by


-----

##### troopers and knocked unconscious’. In effect, this youth had been - like McGregor Watson’s ‘Drummer’ - roughly recruited for labour services from within the jaws of death. The impact of the ordeal resulted in his immediately ‘becoming “cowed”‘. ‘After he recovered consciousness’, Jerome relates,

 ...he became passive and suggestible and willing to take directions. After the initial trauma caused by the attack and resulting massacre... [he] was subjected to further atrocities and was flogged...[30]

 In short, both the intimate recollection of violent death and the continuing threat of it remained pervasive, and a power relationship of omnipotence and incapacity was thereby set in train.
 Furthermore, the intensely personal nature of this power relationship demands attention. Whether the European employer behaved pitilessly or paternally, he was still indisputably the white master, exacting compliance within a singularly authoritarian framework.[31] Here again, the ‘individualized condition’ of the slave’s powerlessness is manifest. As Patterson comments:

 ...the slave is usually powerless in relation to another individual...In his powerlessness, the slave becomes an extension of his master’s power and honour. He is a human surrogate, recreated by his master with god-like power...[32]

 As the Queenslander accurately described the tyranny of this situation for the vanquished Aborigines in 1880:

 One man treats them with kindness, another with brutality: each white does as seems good in his eyes to the wretched savages who have learned in their terror to submit to anything that the conquering race may choose to do.

 According to this newspaper, the brutal station-owner was likely to shoot an Aborigine for a transgression, whereas the ‘liberal’ master would merely flog him before an assemblage of the station’s blacks - two processes equally interpreted as ‘putting the fear of God’ into them.[33] Twenty yearns

##### later, the Southern Protector of Aborigines, Archibald Meston reported from western Queensland in a strikingly similar tone:

 Never before had I seen Aboriginal men living under such extraordinary terrorism, many of them fine athletic fellows who could in the case of a row have settled with their terrorizers in a very summary fashion. But many of them had been long treated as the dogs are treated and were scared into a belief that their employers wielded the power of life or death...[34]

 As Daniel Hart, a former native of Jamaica commented from the Mossman River in 1889 upon the ill-treatment and deaths of Aboriginal men and women, working at Bailey’s Creek Station, ‘I have seen slavery [in the West Indies] but this beats all I have seen’.[35]
 The putative intervention of the law into these unequal, imperious relationships provided no discernible lessening of their severity. The frontier was, by its very nature, an environment where the force of law was directly subordinated to the power of individuals. Aboriginal witnesses were forbidden in a white court of law until 1887 and no special legislation affected white-Aboriginal labour relations until the Native Labourers Protection Act was passed in 1884. Even so, this legislation covered only the northern fishing industry and, as Noel Loos reveals, was a poorly supervised and policed ‘token’ bill which ‘failed utterly to prevent kidnapping’ or to curb the gross abuses of this labour trading. Instead, the legislation was administered to protect capitalist enterprise - ‘the interests of fishermen and not those of indigenous labourers’.[36] As Patterson observes, in direct relevance to this situation:

 ...the master in practice has the power of life or death...the fact that in law constraints are sometimes found is irrelevant. The laws are usually inapplicable as it is usually impossible to prove that the master was not exercising his right to punish his slave.[37]

 As an exasperated white observer exclaimed from the Wide Bay region in 1859, following the arbitrary slaughter of station and town blacks as reprisal for the killing of a white family:


-----

##### I suppose you have said long ago where are your magistrates?...I reply our magistrates are all here and they might just as well be at Jericho; they do not care a fig for either law or justice and in short, knowing how matters stand, they are as guilty of every act of cruelty as the actual perpetrators of them.[38]

 Even in situations where cruelty was not so demonstrably the case, the ‘god-like power’ of the master remained paramount. The reconstitution of Aboriginal tribesman into ‘native labourer’ carried with it a transformation of identity epitomised, for instance, in the bestowal from above of a pointedly Europeanised name - such as ‘Jackie’, ‘Piggie’, or ‘John Bull’ for males and ‘Mary’, ‘Topsy’ or ‘Kittie’ for females.[39] As McGregor-Watson remarked of the offspring born to ‘Drummer’ and ‘Louie’: ‘We christened them Archie and Murray (after our two nephews M. and A. Black of Tarwin, Gippsland)’.[40] Sometimes the imprint of the master’s control was rendered more indelibly. Constance Petrie notes, for example, of several Aborigines employed at timber-getting by her ostensibly benevolent parent, Tom Petrie: ‘... all in after years possessed my father’s brand on their arm’.[41]
 More conventionally, masters rewarded ‘really good’ male blacks with crescent shaped brass plates, hung by a chain or leather thong around the bearer’s neck.[42] This carried an engraved, and usually sardonic appellation, such as ‘King Billy’ upon it and was presented not only as a reward for ‘good conduct’ rendered, but was worn also as a symbol of that particular Aborigine’s active collaboration with the white regime. For it was these wearers of the half-moon shaped disc who helped keep the other black workers on the station in exploitable order at the master’s behest. Such collaboration is perhaps best seen as a kind of coerced deference which, like dogged endurance or covert resistance was one of the few strategies of survival available to the vanquished labourer. It is in this regard that Patterson writes of ‘the aggressive duplicity of the oppressed’.[43] A.W. Stirling reported in 1884:

 A friend of mine...on the Warrego River... tells me it is done at all the stations near him, and prized by the blacks as the highest reward for good service which the white man can bestow. My friend has half-a

-----

##### dozen kings of his own making around his head-station and very useful he finds them in tracking cattle or recovering horses that have strayed away.[44]

 The crescent plate, in short, was arguably the most potent, single symbol of the detribalised Aborigine’s alienation from his traditional culture. With its impressed regal title and imposed name. It hung about his neck as solid testimony of his deracination.
 Yet the alienation experienced by the indigenous worker was necessarily of a different order to that faced by the powerless indent or slave, introduced to enforced labour from an alien land and society. In the latter instance, that worker’s sense of kinlessness and environmental alienation was virtually complete. His utter dependency upon his new master was thus easily established. In the indigene’s case, however, some semblance of kin affiliation and environmental contact usually remained. Just how significantly such factors seriously challenged the master’s achievement of total control is problematical and variable from situation to situation and from place to place.
 To begin with, in most instances, the intricate web of kinship had already been blown apart by the bark of the repeating rifle. Epidemic diseases and malnutrition similarly wreaked havoc upon remaining familial ties, whilst those who lived on were often continually wracked by illness, psychological trauma as well as severe alcohol and drug dependency. It is therefore impossible to imagine anything resembling untrammelled natal support surviving out of genocidal conditions of the frontier. For example. Police Inspector Alex Douglas reported from northwestern Queensland in 1892 that it was the practice of many squatters ‘to herd their cattle with Gins’ because ‘in the early days of settlement the male aborigines had been nearly exterminated’. He continued:

 I believe there is a great deal of truth in this as I have myself on several occasions come across small camps of blacks comprised entirely of Gins and picanninys [sic].[45]

 Patrick Jerome notes additionally that stresses experienced by his great- grandfather were greatly exacerbated by:


-----

##### ...a loss of social Atoms, namely members of his immediate family...and the disruption of the tribal system. His feelings were varied, ranging from fear through to hopelessness and despair.[46]

 Workers such as these would find themselves in virtually the same condition of ‘natal alienation’ as the imported slave or indentured servant.
 Other, ongoing aspects of European Intervention weakened unsteady kinship links as forcefully as frontier violence and disease. The kidnapping and abduction of Aboriginal men, women and children - the forcible dismemberment of clan groups - were common features of Queensland’s colonial race relations.[47] Kidnapping was so common in Worth Queensland as to ‘create no comment and no surprise’ noted the Queensland Figaro in 1884, ‘There is nothing extraordinary in it’.[48] in 1892, a former prospector and mines manager, I.S. Swan corresponded with Chief Justice Lilley upon the large number of Aboriginal women and children employed on pastoral stations between Normanton and Camoweal. He wrote:

 ...now sir, how were the boys and gins procured and how is the supply kept up?...I will inform you by organized partys [sic] going up the Nicholson river and along the coast Point Parker way...also Gunpowder river...These children are brought in and tied up...and if they manage to get away and are caught, God help them...The poor blacks... dare not come to where there was game for fear of kidnapping parties...Now sir I do not object...if they came and went of their own free will, but this slavery and prostitution must end.[49]

 Operating under the rationale that ‘if you take a black or a wild animal, young, each is capable of being domesticated and made useful’, white masters procured Aboriginal children by theft or barter, and sold and exchanged them.[50] Catholic missionary Duncan McNab in 1880 encountered a man from Charters Towers on board a coastal steamer:

 ...who had in his possession a black boy whom he had captured in the interior and was bringing to Ipswich. He...said he had seen a carrier run down a black boy, tie him in chains on his dray and after two days sold him to another carrier for £2.10.0...[51]


-----

##### So prevalent did forcible abduction become that as early as 1868 the colonial authorities contemplated utilising the Slave Act (5 Geo. Cap 113) ‘...with regard to persons having and forcibly keeping in their possession any aboriginal for whom they cannot lawfully account’.[52] Upon the sea- frontier, too, the policy of ‘shanghai-ing’ indigenous workers was ‘rife’.[53]
 Hugh Milman, the Cooktown Police Magistrate noted in 1884 that ‘a regular traffic takes place on the coast for smart young lads, the current price being £4.00’.[54] ‘There is no disguise about that kind of slave trade’, commented the Queensland Figaro as, once more, both the Slave Act and the Polynesian Labourers Act were suggested as official remedies for such widespread abuses.[55]
 Thus, it would seem that Aborigines were not merely expelled from land ownership and compelled to work for a new proprietor upon that ‘property ’ in discrete though depleted clan groupings. At times, in remote regions, where limited European intercommunication occurred, this may well have been the case. Yet, just as readily, such groupings could be further dispersed as partners were separated, children removed from parents, the old segregated from the young, the useful from the useless, and so on. Fishermen, timbergetters, drovers, nawkers, carriers and publicans as well as pastoralists, small selectors and townspeople all took their pick from among black survivors for labour and sexual services and, in so doing, forcibly cut them off from ‘the protection and demands’ of their natal group.[56] Southern Aboriginal Protector Meston reported as late as 1901:

 Scattered among the stations of Western Queensland are small parties of Aborigines among whom the family ties have long been severed...This isolation of solitary men and women, and couples, and small groups of old people and children separated widely from friends, family and class
 [sic] relations is a source of much fretting and grief among those Western Aboriginals. I met the fathers and mothers of boys and girls whom they had not seen for years. That is a common complaint over a large area of Queensland.[57]

 In this context, ‘natal alienation’ emerges as an important characteristic of Aboriginal-white labour relations, drawing those relations once more into the matrix of the slave/master relationship. Once the relative powerlessness


-----

##### of the black worker was grasped, there was really no end to the potential novelty of his or her transferability and exchange. As Patterson states, in this regard, ‘The slave is the ultimate human tool, as imprintable and as disposable as the master wishes’.[58] Upon the severance of kinship ties, the colonised Aborigine is presented in this very condition of deprivation and angst. This situation again accords closely with Patterson’s synopsis of ‘kinlessness’ when he writes:

 It is the forceful and (for locally born slaves) enforceable alienation of the slaves from all natal ties of ‘blood’ and sentiment and from any conception of having by right of birth any attachment to groups or localities other than those the master chooses for him which gives the relation of slavery its peculiar value to the master.[59]

 The issue of ‘attachment to... localities’ seems co-terminus to that of attachment to kin. Even when Aborigines did remain as dispossessed workers upon their original tribal lands, that environment had been ecologically transformed by the intrusion of Europeans with their flocks and herds, farms, plantations and townships. Land seizures and massive clearances, the monopolisation of water courses and lagoons as well as plethora of urban, agricultural, mining and pastoral adaptations had a devastating effect upon the indigenous flora and fauna. The disruption of life cycles and the subtle natural signs which had guided hunting and foraging activities rendered access tenuous and survival doubtful. James Fairlie noted from the Wide Bay region, for instance, how:

 ...The whites in taking their lands and felling the scrubs made it difficult, almost impossible for them to live in their native way. The scrubs, in which for ages they had hunted wallabies and dug yams were destroyed and the trees, in many places felled into the river, prevented them from fishing with their nets along the river banks close to the mangroves on which the mullet found food.[60]

 Environmental alienation was thus accomplished as much temporally as spatially. The displaced Aborigine, however, was not so utterly disadvantaged in this regard as the imported Melanesian. Mrs McConnell, wife of the owner of Cressbrook station found it quaintly humorous that one


-----

##### of her black servants, ‘Long Kitty’ would ‘say, stretching out her arms, “All this yarman (land) belonging to me”‘.[61] Yet the crucial psychic linkage with one’s ‘hearth-land’ provided important emotional and psychological support. Familiarity with locale, terrain and exploitable natural resources also remained, providing at certain times of year, some potential for self- survival, however tentative. Hence, the frequent complaint from white employers that Aborigines were ‘unreliable’ workers, who periodically ‘went walkabout’. A nigger is not good until you get him off his beat’ was a piece of conventional bush-wisdom, as settlers advocated a policy of taking Aborigines ‘out of their own district to work them - the same scheme as for the South Sea Islanders’.[62] Some offered more novel suggestions. The best way to induce blacks to work, two central Queensland squatters affirmed, was ‘...to cut off their great toes. They could not then climb the trees for opossums’.[63] Others responded more conventionally to Aboriginal absconders. An Aboriginal youth who fled Connemara station, near Blackall in 1883 was recaptured by the overseer and then flogged to death as a warning to the others.[64] A correspondent to the Worker wrote from Thargomindah a decade later:

 For a long time past I have been cognisant of blackfellows being followed and brought back by the squatters’ orders when they attempt to run away from work, and one station manager I know always has them handcuffed and leg-ironed when brought back. I have also known a blackfellow pulled up to the beam of the store by means of a rope placed round his neck by the stockman and manager and told when he had recovered his breath that they would hang him altogether the next time he ran away.[65]

 There was ‘a mutual understanding’ throughout the West that ‘a runaway black could be hunted and brought back’, reported Archibald Meston in 1901, ‘On Bulloo Downs, there are blacks who, for running away from hard work and harsh treatment have been brought back, handcuffed, tied up and flogged’.[66] The call of the land was thus often answered and practically counteracted by the routine paraphernalia of slave/indent/convict discipline
 - the leg-iron and the lash.


-----

##### Land alienation was also the crucial determinant in the legal position of the vanquished Aborigine. The official recognition of tribal lands as ‘uninhabited, waste land’,[67] according to the wisdom of eighteenth century jurisprudence ensured that Aborigines possessed no legal claim whatever to land ownership under British law. Not only were traditional land rights denied, but even the idea of Aborigines repossessing land via purchase was also discounted. In 1876 when the Reverend Duncan McNab attempted to obtain small land grants for an Aboriginal agricultural settlement, the scheme was vetoed. A.H. Palmer, the former Premier told the Queensland Legislative Assembly that McNab’s ideas were ‘utterly Utopian, especially those in regard to the legalising of marriage and the entail of property among the aboriginals - those he looked upon as absurd’.[68] Similarly, when the Aborigines Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Bill was being debated in November 1897, a clause allowing blacks to purchase land was peremptorily deleted. Horace Tozer, the Home Secretary simply stated that he ‘did not like [clause 32] sub-section 16 at all. He did not want to be bothered about aboriginals and half-castes selecting land and he moved that the subsection be omitted.’ This was done without any further debate.
 Such a total denial of land rights brings us once more into closer consideration of the slave condition. For, as Patterson is at pains to point out, in defining the legal form of slavery:

 It is not because the slave becomes a form or object of property relations, but because he is denied all possibility of being a subject of property relations, a proprietor, that property is so important in the transformation of slavery. The slave is distinct in being proper-tyless, in lacking any and all proprietorial capacities. And from this primary transformative disability flows all the other legal disabilities of the slave.[70]

 In making this significant interpretative point, Patterson circumvents the ‘irrelevant and misleading’ definition of the slave as a form of property. For, ‘to say that the slave is a form of property does not specify anything distinctive about the condition of slavery since all persons, free or slave can be and are forms or objects of property’.[71] Aborigines, too, were often regarded as ‘objects or property’ by white proprietors. Employers of Aborigines often spoke of themselves unselfconsciously as the ‘boys’


-----

##### owners’ and some local settlers even went so far as to enquire of Protector Galbraith how they could bequeath Aboriginal employees to their beneficiaries in their wills.[72] Employers of black labour. Northern Protector Walter Roth wrote, ‘looked upon the possession... as part of their vested interests and hitherto, in the majority of cases, have given them no wages’.[73]
 Yet the fact of Aborigines being regarded and treated as objects of property is not so significant, for the purposes of definition, as the fact that they were rendered, like any slave ‘wholly propertyless’. From this central deprivation, all other disabilities flowed. To quote Patterson once more:

 ...because the slave is propertyless, he lacks all patrimonial capacities and can claim no powers of custody over his children; he may cohabit and sometimes, by convention, his common-law wife may not be violated, but he has no proprietorial claims or powers in her person, her earnings or her offspring, nor she in him.[74]

 As we have already seen, the consummate ease with which Europeans interfered in Aboriginal kin relalations, ‘benevolently’ selecting partners for their workers or ruthlessly separating them, usurping the sexual services of Aboriginal women or ‘getting a bush friend...to bring them down a boy or girl’,[75] all adduce to an utter lack of rights possessed by the colonised Aborigine. Not only were land rights ignored, but also conjugal, patrimonial and custodial rights were overlooked and subverted. Property rights and civil rights were both considered, for the black labourer, to be beyond the pale.
 This condition of propertylessness, with its consequent lack of rights and power ensured that Aborigines would remain as persons without honour in white, society. Any local respect which may have grudgingly been won by the desperate tenacity of their resistance campaigns was rapidly dissipated. In fact. Aborigines became the most dishonoured of people, scarcely being regarded by many whites as above animal status. Polygenism, the dogma that different races represented distinct species, prevalent in the United States and England in the mid-nineteenth century enjoyed an extended longevity in the Australian colonies. It was still being popularly affirmed in Queensland in the opening decade of this century. As the Queenslander summarised the situation in 1889:


-----

##### ...the aboriginal inhabitants are treated exactly in the same way as the wild beasts or birds...Their lives and property... are held by the European as being at their absolute disposal. Their goods are taken, their children forcibly stolen, their women carried away, entirely at the caprice of the white man...[77]

 Twenty years later, Protector Meston reported from the West:

 We meet there with people who still regard the aboriginal as of no more value in the scale of being than a horse or a bullock, an Inheritance from those who shot him like a kangaroo, abducted his women and sent his children away to distant friends with as much indifference as if they were pet squirrels and tame galahs...They were either not credited with any human instincts or those instincts were entirely disregarded.[78]

 Aboriginal workers were thus habitually seen to be ‘like animals’ - as ‘sub- human’, with ‘less capacity for feeling pain’ and likely to repay any ‘kindness’ shown towards them with ‘ingratitude’ and ‘treachery’.[79]
 This ideological scan once more brands the black worker with the mark of the slave. For, as Patterson reveals, ‘slaves are usually persons without honour. The slave’s loss of honour and manhood is the master’s gain’. Honour resides in the reputation afforded ‘the whole man’ - ‘a matter of his feelings, his behaviour and the respect he receives’.[80] Aborigines, commonly regarded by whites as ‘ferae natura’, ‘vermin to be trampled on’, or, if conceded to be human, a little ‘above the level of a working animal’ were placed, like pariahs, beneath contempt - at the nadir of any scale of honour.[81] This does not mean, of course, that Aborigines accepted the base status afforded them without protest or demur. The same modes of resistance open to the slave - absconding, passive disobedience and physical defiance - were adopted as well by the long-suffering black worker. For instance, two white men in pursuit of a ‘runaway black boy’ were killed by the tomahawks and spears of other tribal members at Strathalbyn in 1871.[82]
 in 1884, Ernest Henry, utilising the labour power of a score of Aborigines to build a roadway to his copper mine, Argylla, near Cloncurry began a letter home:

 My dear Mother,


-----

##### Do not be alarmed for I am nearly well now and...I promise you to take more care...The fact is I have been speared by a blackfellow...At first Γ had no hope of recovering, for I thought the spear was broken in me and felt as If I was stuffed with a rod of iron...

 This altercation had occurred after Henry had deprived his assailant of rations for refusing further work for him.
 Yet, in most instances, the relentlessness of European reactions overrode any resistance attempts. As A. Turnbull commented from Burketown in 1896, ‘...even now...a rebellious nigger loses the number of his mess [i.e. is killed] in a remarkably short time (and no questions asked)’.[84] Ultimately, as the threat of physical death hung continually over the heads of the colonised indigenes, their situation was reduced to that of ‘a form of social death’.[85] For even while their physical lives may have been spared, their social lives in a society which both despised them and fully endorsed the master’s coercive controls, were not.
 In summation, Patterson defines slavery as:

 ...an individualized condition of powerlessness, natal alienation and dishonour represented legally as a condition of propertylessness and symbolically as a state of social death.

 No other group of unfree persons can be so defined.[86]

 From the foregoing, therefore, it would appear that the phrase ‘Aboriginal slavery’ may be applied not simply as a loosely analogous term of opprobrium, but as one which may be defended with academic precision and rigour. For, in the process of definition, the striking parallels across time and space between the condition of the slave and the unfree Aboriginal worker are starkly revealed; and the cry of isolated, nineteenth century humanitarians over a ‘rampant demon of... slavery’ stalking inland Australia seems to be vindicated.[87] Ironically, men zealously engaged in exposing atrocity rather than expounding any thoroughly elaborated theory had correctly labelled a labour form which they abhorred. ‘Slavery’ was their cri de coeur, rather than any cautiously conceived analysis of indigenous labour. Though less concerned with accuracy than with accusation, however, they had intuitively grasped the contours of a labour pattern which


-----

##### would evade the interpretative powers of later commentators, slipping mercury-like through their fingers.
 For Aboriginal workers themselves, the daily realities of their work- experience as an Internally colonised people seared Into their consciousnesses. Though rarely articulated within earshot of whites, powerlessness and alienation were as keenly felt as the deprivation of rations or as the boot and the whip of their employers. A correspondent to the Queenslander in 1885 found it hard to see how Western stations could be worked without Aboriginal assistance. Yet the vast majority of labourers received ‘no remuneration save tucker and clothes’ and were spoken of by whites as ‘our niggers’. Writing from Thargomindah, he reported cases where ‘blacks belonging to both sexes had been followed, brought back and punished’.[88] Years later, a large number of the survivors of these same Aboriginal workers, taking advantage of vast pastoral dislocations caused by the Great Drought, began a journey of reconciliation.
 From stations ‘varying in distance to 250 miles’, they came in early 1900, to the outskirts of Thargomindah. A small party of Aborigines travelling down the Diamantina with ‘the “Mooloo” corroborree’ had begun the exodus, and this movement was joined by people coming in from the Warrego, the Bulloo, Wilson and Cooper’s Creek. ‘So there had come at length a commonly expressed desire to meet at some appointed place for the purpose of a reunion’, wrote Archibald Meston: ‘It was a meeting of husbands and wives and relations who had been separated for years.’ On the margins of the township they had camped - ‘a mob of nearly a hundred’ - and though ‘chiefly clothed in rags, half-starved and dejected’, here they had preferred to remain, among kin and subsisting for months upon the desultory charity of white town-dwellers, rather than return to their respective places of employment.[89] Yet even this grand initiative was soon to be thwarted. With Meston’s arrival, the Thargomindah gathering became a target group for the attentions of the state, under the auspices of its new ‘protective’ legislation. Sections of the mob were drafted off, by police and Protector, to the coastal reserves of Durundur, Fraser Island, and later, Barambah. With the implementation of the segregative clauses of the 1897 Aborigines Protection... Act, therefore, that frail hedge of kinship communication and environmental contact which Aborigines had shakily maintained in the face of the pastoralists’ onslaught had now too been broached.

 THE WORKERS’ PARADOX: INDENTURED LABOUR IN THE QUEENSLAND SUGAR INDUSTRY TO 1920

 Kay Saunders

##### Queensland in the late nineteenth century was a society of paradox, containing within it very diverse cultural and economic elements. It possessed a classical sugar plantation system which emerged in the 1860s, matured in the early 1880s and spectacularly collapsed a decade later. But uncomfortable vestiges of it remained alongside a small farm/’central’ or cooperatively-owned mill system. A second paradox was that Queensland also possessed a pastoral, mining and agricultural economy. So sugar was but one segment, albeit an important one within this varied economy. Another anomaly was that Queensland, in the period after the conquest of the Aborigines, acquired a predominantly British-derived population which resided overwhelmingly in the urban centres. But unlike the other Australian colonies, Queensland also contained substantial and diverse non-white minorities who were located primarily in the vast coastal sugar regions.
 This chapter will trace the development of indentured labour in Queensland in the second half of the nineteenth century, with special focus upon the sugar industry. Another series of paradoxes present themselves, for the partial destruction of the classical plantation system produced a curious hybrid transitional structure with forms of unionised labour performed by white men. This unprecedented feature owed its existence to salient political as well as economic factors. So whilst Queensland by the early twentieth century had become one of Australia’s dependent states because of the minimal existence of secondary industry, the reliance upon unstable primary industries and chronic drought, it was nevertheless subsumed within the wider political entity of the Commonwealth of Australia after 1901. If Australia was to commit itself to a ‘White Australia’ policy, then the Queensland sugar industry could no longer employ Pacific Island and Asian workers. Queensland was thus a society of paradox both within the Australian and imperial contexts.


-----

##### The first important paradox can be traced to the original colony of New South Wales (NSW) in the early nineteenth century, which contained elements that linked it unequivocally to the slave colonies of the Empire. Since Queensland did not separate from NSW until 1859, it is necessary to examine the development of unfree labour in the parent colony in order to understand the patterns that evolved out of the original system. In 1809 provisions were announced to allow Indians and Chinese to enter the penal settlement of NSW as bonded servants.[1] But their labour was not called upon while adequate numbers of transported British felons were available. Convicts operated as a variant of the slave mode of production, where the ownership of material resources like land, equipment, livestock and grain and the labour power of the assigned felons were united, like slaves, within the forces of production.[2] Connell and Irving have recently and questionably argued that:

 The legal basis of assignment was decidedly Marxist, the convicts’ labour power being regarded as a kind of commodity that was granted to the settlers by the government which maintained (in theory) control over the convicts’ person.[3]

 This interpretation ignores several important factors. First, under the Transportation Acts of 1717 and 1824, the state, in the person of the governor, owned the labour services of transported felons. These could be maintained within the public infrastructure to build roads, bridges or used in the private sector as assigned convicts. Thus, the essential criterion of ownership was unambiguous. The masters could not extract labour permanently from felons, as they owned, via the transfer of the governor’s prerogative, ‘property in the services’ as distinct from ‘property in the person’ and only for the duration of the transportee’s assignment whilst undergoing colonial exile and punishment. This does not alter the structure of the master/ slave syndrome. Slavery does not depend upon its being an hereditary status or for durante-vitae. Secondly, the transfer of the convict’s labour power was not a commodity, in the sense of a wage labourer selling his/her labour power on an open market. The felon’s labour power was directed by the authority of the governor and in no sense could an assigned convict choose a master or barter for wages. Thus, the Australian experience was different from that of the West Indies in the early nineteenth century, where masters owned their slaves outright. Most importantly, the Australian

##### system was also different because initial ownership was vested in the apparatus of the state. It was even futher complicated by the fact that the owners of capital were originally the military and civil administrators of the colony.
 Contemporary observers frequently recognised that Australian convictism was a variation of slavery; but as Governor George Arthur of Van Diemen’s Land (VDL) assured any wavering doubters in 1835:

 Convicts, it is true are not black but white - and they are fellow countrymen - but they are criminals and the master may draw from his knowledge of their crimes a sanction, quite as satisfactory as that arising from differences of colour for any severity he would practise against them.[4]

 Unlike slave societies in other areas of the British Empire, NSW concurrently contained the widespread slave-variant mode (assignment) and both indenture and wage labouring of emancipated felons and non-convict British immigrant workers. These two categories could not be totally controlled, despite the operation of the punitive Masters and Servants Acts. As transportation drew to a close in the late 1830s, masters, wanting to ensure a continuing cheap servile labour force, deluged the Secretary of State for the Colonies with petitions demanding its continuance: the wealthy and influential colonial capitalists, recognising that the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Glenelg, was committed to the principle that NSW was to be henceforth the home of the British stock, undertook other measures to ensure the continuance of unfree forms of labour.
 In 1837, forty Indians were initially introduced into NSW on five year terms of servitude and two further contingents went to the newly-formed convict-free colony of South Australia and another to the Swan River Colony (later Western Australia) the following year. One pastoralist revealed to a select committee enquiring into immigration that in NSW by 1838 some 1203 Chinese and Indian shepherds had already been engaged by 111 masters, most of whom also used assigned British felons.[5] Though the Sydney Herald, one of NSW’s most influential newspapers, declaimed that ‘slavery could not exist in this colony [as] the British abhor it ... [and] would crush it’, nevertheless concerned colonists felt that the settlement could readily become ‘a kind of civilised Tunis’ or ‘an emporium of an Eastern slave-trade’.[6] Many settlers feared that NSW might become another Jamaica.

##### Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, moreover warned Governor Gipps that extensive Asian indenture would deter British settlement, as working-class Britons would be reluctant to locate themselves in a settlement which contained racially distinct and ‘degraded elements’.[7]
 But viewed across the Empire, this basic conflict of interest between abstract policies formulated in Whitehall and the urgent demands of wealthy colonists in NSW for cheap coloured labour had far-reaching ramifications. Australian pastoralists in the years 1837 to 1839 were essentially instigating the very same procedures as the West Indian and Mauritian sugar planters who were trying desperately to counteract the effects of emancipation. Certainly, their motives and requirements corresponded perfectly - to obtain a numerically inexhaustible, inexpensive and docile workforce which could be regimented and assiduously exploited. Furthermore, both the West Indies and Mauritius, on the one hand, and NSW and VDL, on the other, had possessed systems of slavery, complete and unambiguous in the former instances and an incomplete variation in the latter. The objections of the Colonial Office, however forcefully presented, might have been disregarded by Australian pastoralists who were willing to finance Indian and Chinese indenture without official supervision or assistance. But the Indian regulations of 1839 effectively prevented any comprehensive implementation of earlier proposals,[8] and the depression in the wool industry in the early 1840s rendered further expansion unfeasible. Several contingents of Indians were introduced however to the Darling Downs and Burnett regions of pre-separation Queensland in 1844. In 1862 the newly separated colony of Queensland passed an act specifically designed to import Indian indentured servants on a large scale. Though few Indians actually came to this tropical colony, the pattern of non-European indenture was firmly established and endured right into the twentieth century. These patterns were abandoned in the wealthy colonies of NSW and Victoria, which, by the 1860s, maintained significant secondary industries in the urban areas.[9]
 But long before these industrial patterns emerged, NSW had predominantly a pastoral economy, based upon the labour of transported felons. In 1824 a secondary detention centre for recalcitrant and reconvicted felons was established in the remote Moreton Bay district of NSW where free white settlers were prohibited from entering. It was a particularly harsh and primitive penal settlement[10] which contributed little to the subsequent development of labour patterns, for it did not permit assignment. In the early


-----

##### 1840s, when this penal settlement was still operating, wealthy pastoralists illegally entered the adjacent Darling Downs or ‘northern districts’ of NSW, accompanied by the assigned and ‘ticket-of-leave’ holders (convicts on probation). Moreton Bay, the Darling Downs, Stanley and the Burnett districts, became the southern areas of Queensland after 1859. Into the 1850s ‘ticket-of-leave’ holders and emancipists formed the basis of the labour force there.

 Table 8.1: Adult British Population in Pre-Separation Queensland, 1846 and 1851

 Writing of the late 1850s and the 1860s, A.C. Grant, the manager of Cadaga, a large sheep property in the Burnett district, remarked:

 A large number of the white men employed in those days were men who had been convicts and “Pentonville” exiles ... Having arrived in the district with the first white settlers, they seemed to attach themselves ... to the fortunes of their employers, apparently coming to the conclusion that they formed part and parcel of the station plant.[11]


-----

##### These ‘Pentonville exiles’, the last British convicts transported to the east coast of Australia, were despatched to pre-separation Queensland in 1849 and 1850. They were engaged by pastoralists, who continued to demand a labour force that was cheap and servile. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, masters on the Darling Downs might exploit the labour of assigned convicts, ‘ticket-of-leave’ holders, ‘exiles’ on probation, emancipists, Chinese, Indians, Germans and Aborigines.[12] in May 1844, two pastoralists, Philip Flierl and Gordon Sandeman, engaged twenty-five Indians from Calcutta despite the 1839 regulations prohibiting Indians from overseas agricultural and pastoral indenture. Two years later Flierl published a pamphlet entitled ‘The Advantages of Indian Labour in the Australian Colonies’ which unambiguously assured other potential importers that Indians were always ‘suspicious of kindness’.[13] His own policy was to intimidate, starve and flog his workers. These unfortunate servants took refuge with the Commissioner of Crown Lands, Dr Stephen Simpson, who refused to allow the Indians to return to work.[14] Subsequently, Flierl and Sandeman looked to China for indentured servants and in 1848, they introduced a further 108 Chinese who went on strike when they found their wages were far less than white workers performing the same tasks.[15] Over 2000 Chinese were introduced in the 1840s and 1850s altogether.[16]
 Following the classic patterns of colonial conquest and subjugation, the indigenous people were forced not only to cede their rights of ownership to the conquered territory but also to perform labour services for the new proprietor. These were exacted from them and were not subject to the contractual obligations of indentured servitude. Unlike the assigned convict who also worked without remuneration, the blacks were not being punished for designated crimes. They could not anticipate any remission of their ‘sentence’. The Aborigines were therefore de facto chattels bound securely to the new owners of their lands. In structural terms these sheep stations in nineteenth century Queensland possessed a quasi-slave mode of production, with the added complications of indentured service and wage labouring existing simultaneously. (See Ch.7)
 In the early 1860s, the distinguished ethnologist, Henry Maine, was selected by the Indian government to consolidate within a single framework all the legislation and regulations relating to Indian indenture overseas.[17] It was during this period of official reassessment that the newly-established colony of Queensland passed An Act to Give Force of Law to Regulations for

##### the Introduction and Protection of Labourers from British India. It was enthusiastically sponsored by the governor, George Ferguson Bowen, a committed advocate of the utility and profitability of non-European servile labour for the tropical regions within the Empire.[18] His vision for Queensland duplicated and articulated those of the influential and often aristocratic pastoralists, and later sugar planters, who envisaged a society where they would reign supreme and unhindered over vast armies of servile non-white workers.
 The premises upon which their ideal was embedded were clear - Queensland possessed a sub-tropical physical environment where British labour seemed to them to be neither economically nor racially feasible. Therefore, in order to establish profitable industries, particularly sugar cane and cotton cultivation, it was deemed necessary to introduce the classical plantation system involving an exclusive wealthy elite (the proprietors), a numerically small technical and supervisory staff of Britons and thousands of legally servile ‘coolies’ to perform the arduous toil. Certainly this was one view, albeit a resoundingly persuasive one, in the new colony. The incipient urban liberal bourgeoisie who wanted a democratic white Australia opposed this. But their objections were not strong enough to prevent the introduction of non-European indentured servants.[19] It was not the outcome of political manoeuvres within the colony itself, but the Indian government’s delay in approving the 1862 Act which proved decisive. When it was eventually ratified in 1864, Queensland’s rural capitalists had already secured an extensive alternative source of labour and therefore no longer needed Indians. Melanesians from the Loyalty Islands and the New Hebrides were first introduced into Moreton Bay in August 1863 by the prominent entrepreneur Robert Towns. Their indenture had one outstanding advantage - Queensland would not be forced to compete with the established sugar colonies for Indian labourers. While the colony never enjoyed a monopoly in recruiting Pacific Islanders, it did provide the most attractive terms of service within the region.[20] Queensland sugar planters behaved more like their counterparts in British Guiana, for, though they might commit themselves primarily to one source of indentured worker, they were fully aware of the vagaries resulting from uncontrollable forces such as internal economic crises and slumps in the world sugar prices which crucially affected their operations. To this end, they experimented widely with various ethnic groups to meet the needs of changing economic circumstances, though the


-----

##### Melanesians existed as their mainstay from 1863 until 1904, when their further introduction was prohibited by the Commonwealth.
 In those years 62, 565 Pacific Islanders were introduced into Queensland, peaking numerically in the years 1881 to 1884 with a little over 14, 300. Over 65 per cent of all recruits came from the Loyalty, New Hebrides, Banks and Torres groups, though significantly over seventy per cent of all Solomon Islanders came in the period after 1890 (see appendix 1). This may be compared with the statistics for the Asians.

 Table 8.2: Ethnic Composition of Asian Workers in Queensland, 1871-1901.

 The tribal origin of the Melanesian population altered over time as did the age distribution and the relative proportions of ‘new chums’ and ‘old hands’. Peter Corris estimated that twenty-five per cent of Solomom Islanders in Queensland were young lads under the age of sixteen, the minimum which was laid down in the Polynesian Labourers Act of 1868. The majority were young men between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five. By the 1890s more than one quarter of recruits were ‘old chums’, a term used for returned Islanders who re-enlisted.[21] The Melanesian population in Queensland was always predominantly male, with females constituting less than ten per cent of servants. The Polynesian Labourers Act specifically required all Melanesian women recruits to be accompanied by their bona-fide husbands; though this was rarely the case as colonial servitude offered an escape for eloping unmarried couples. In April 1869, the Attorney-General informed the governor that ‘our policy should be so defined as to make ... [Melanesian] immigration a temporary aid to us and not to encourage its permanent settlement in this country’.[22] Two years later the Liberal parliamentarian John Douglas warned that:


-----

##### The existence of a servile class amongst us, protected by special legislation and unincorporable with the permanent population of the colony [the British] is radically opposed to the genus of Australian colonisation.[23]

 It was clearly envisaged that those Pacific Islanders who were brought to Queensland would not be allowed to become permanent settlers; for even if the institution of indenture was hoped by the pastoralists and sugar planters to be more than a temporary expedient there would be a constant turnover of individuals within it. Queensland wanted to avoid the mistake of the USA where Africans, introduced as a temporary measure in the 17th century, had become, by the end of the following century, permanent and entrenched chattels.[24] The policy by which young men enlisted without wives and children ensured that most remained in the colony only a few years. Moreover, the masters, always diligent in their efforts to maximise profits and minimise expenditure, were not therefore encumbered with the expense and responsibility of maintaining the unproductive units of small children and the elderly. It is ironical to contemplate that as far as efficient and experienced agricultural workers were concerned these would undoubtedly be women in Melanesia. Men would clear the tropical scrub and prepare the gardens for cultivation (as they were also required to do as indentured labourers in Queensland) but the routine and arduous work of tending the crops, weeding the gardens and harvesting was definitely ‘women’s work’. They were also the stock-keepers of domesticated pigs. Men in Melanesia, though this is a very broad generalisation, were engaged in house construction, fishing and canoe building, if ‘salt-water’ or coastal dwellers, and hunting if inland dwellers. Clearly, there existed a definite apportionment of labour on the basis of gender. Pacific Islander males entering into colonial servitude were invariably unaccustomed to routine and monotonous daily labour in the same way women were.
 The initial Islanders from Tanna, Lifu and Eromanga (all in the New Hebrides), engaged by the early cotton planters in the Nerang district of Moreton Bay, were employed in varying capacities, primarily as unskilled field workers. With more experience, some managed horse and bullock teams and others handled the innovatory steam ploughs.[25] Until the 1868 Act, when a term of three years’ servitude was laid down, most Islanders previously had been engaged for a term of one years’ indenture.

##### Robert Towns rewarded those workers who decided to re-engage with increasingly skilled duties, though their remuneration was kept at £6 per annum. The labour crisis was more acute in the interior pastoral regions and by 1869, 697 of the 1539 Melanesians in the colony were located there,[26]
 employed predominantly as shepherds. The Rev. Frederick Richmond, an itinerant Anglican priest in the 1870s in western Queensland, caustically commented that:

 The kanakas [Melanesians] were employed to such an extent that the Queensland interior promised to become a wilderness of savages and dollar hunters. Stations [pastoral] as large as English counties would not employ more than half a dozen white men.[27]

 The wealthy pastoralist and former Indian planter, Robert Gray, recalled that:

 Owing to the difficulty of obtaining white labour, I had obtained a few South Sea Islanders, whom I had indented when down in Bowen. They were from Lifu and Tanna. During the time they were with me they were very useful and were fairly good at lambing and bush work.[28]

 Unlike the predominant system of gang labour on the coastal plantations, the exigencies of the ‘outback’ (as the dry interior of Australia is called) demanded small isolated groups. Charles Rome, the lessee of a large sheep station, reported that in order to prevent the Islanders ‘pining’ they would be ‘double-banked’,[29] so that two rather than one man would tend stock. The Melanesians hated working in the unfamiliar, desolate, dry sheep regions. The Rev. J.C. Kirby recalled seeing a group of Islanders travelling inland. This reminded him of ‘a scene from Uncle Tom’s Cabin, especially since their white guards on horseback were fully armed with pistols’.[30]
 As early as 1867, the Secretary of State for the Colonies wrote that he was dismayed that so many Melanesians were located on remote properties far from official supervision.[31] in 1877, the newly-elected Liberal government under John Douglas passed a Bill which confined first contract Islanders to sub-tropical and tropical agriculture, ‘as was intended’.[32] Though in some measure this may be attributed to humanitarian reformism, the primary reason lay with the Liberals’ desire to exclude Pacific Islanders and other imported non-Europeans from the colony. Certainly, when the conservatives


-----

##### (largely composed of pastoralists and planters) regained power in 1879, they did not reverse this decision. The following year they expanded upon the Liberals’ regulations. The reasons for this unusual unanimity are easy to detect. The conservatives recognised that the Pacific Islanders were no longer an essential component of the pastoral workforce; for with the increasing use of fencing and dams a large labour force was no longer necessary. Pastoralists, from the 1870s, began to rely upon white itinerant contract shearers rather than permanently employed shepherds.[33]
 Unlike the capital intensive pastoral station, the sugar plantation was both capital and labour intensive. Gradually all the available supply of imported indentured servants was withdrawn from the pastoral sector into tropical agriculture, which operated upon the basis of large numbers of unfree workers performing routine production tasks. Australia generally (and Queensland specifically) in the period 1860 to 1890 experienced an unprecedented expansion in production, volume of trade, and in flow of investment capital from Britain.[34] Paradoxically, the internal structure of the Queensland situation diverted it simultaneously into quite distinct and unique patterns within the Australian colonies, for no other colony possessed the physical environment and political conditions in which the classic plantation structure could emerge.
 The sugar industry underwent a series of changes and different labour patterns can be detected in each phase. The period 1862 to 1870 witnessed the ‘commitment to a staple’ phase. Sugar cane was initially cultivated in the more temperate southern coastal regions of the Logan and Moreton Bay, though by 1866 substantial plantations had been established in the more suitable tropical area of Mackay. The second major phase, the ‘Consolidation Phase’ from 1871 to 1879, was characterised by the rapid expansion northwards into the fertile areas of the Herbert, Johnstone River and Cairns districts. In these areas, planters would purchase large tracts of land and construct relatively primitive mills. Airdmillan Estate on the Lower Burdekin comprised 5000 acres and English speculators had invested £150, 000 by 1879.[35] During these years throughout the colony the acreage under cane expanded tenfold, the number of mills increased from thirty-nine to sixty- eight and the value of exports rose astronomically from £41 in 1871 to £275, 769 in 1879 (see appendix 3). This was consumed in the Australian market. The number of Melanesians being introduced into the colony rose from 643 in 1870 to 2182 nine years later (see appendix 1).


-----

##### These three characteristics - northern expansion, a classic plantation system and fluctuating prices and seasons - all developed in the ensuing period, the ‘Speculative Phase’, 1880 to 1885. These years were particularly crucial, for the plantation system matured, only to collapse spectacularly at the end of the decade. One third (18, 231) of the total number of Pacific Islanders who entered the colony from 1863 to 1904 arrived in these six years. This phase also witnessed unprecedented capital investment from Melbourne and London. Increasingly, though not exclusively, joint stock companies rather than wealthy, often aristocratic sugar planters owned sugar estates. As John Hinchcliffe had commented:

 The avocation of the sugar planters is certainly connected with success, wealth, intelligence, refinement and honour... in all countries [it] ... is the very highest in the whole scope of an agricultural profession.[36]

 The colonial planters strove to establish an aristocratic society with themselves at the apex, dominating their white and non-European workers under their leisurely paternalistic aegis. The sugar yield was very low, one and a half tons of sugar cane was crushed per acre.[37] As early as 1869, the planters were criticised for retaining inefficient and unproductive methods, such as employing vast numbers of servile workers toiling under the gang system ‘instead of improving cultivation methods’ and using heavy machinery and more sophisticated technology in the crushing and juice extractor mills.[38]
 The sugar planters and companies in the years of unprecedented expansion of the early 1880s, confident that the generous prices for sugar on the world market would remain stable, believed their most urgent problem was to secure an ever-increasing labour force of servile field-workers, rather than to improve productivity. But they were confronted with spiralling costs, for the cost of introducing each Melanesian recruit had increased from the usual £7 in 1863 to up to £16 in 1876 and £20 a few years later.[39] Concomitantly, the cost of returning labourers whose terms of servitude had expired, which legally had to be borne by the master, rose from £3.10.0 to £10 from 1863 to 1883.[40]
 The cost of wages for routine gang labourers was increasing too. The 1868 Act had stipulated that all first-contract workers should be paid £6 per annum with food, clothing, housing and medical attendance provided by the

##### master. By the mid 1880s Melanesian field labourers on first-contract, given the intense demands for their labour, were able to command £15 p.a. whilst time-expired workers got £15 to £20 in the southern district of Bundaberg and up to £30 p.a. in the northern Herbert River area.[41] The Liberal parliamentarian, James Drake, was correct when he stated that ‘The Kanakas do not like field work anymore than white men’,[42] for a usual day meant labouring from 6am to 6pm with a brief breakfast and lunch break under extremely onerous and filthy conditions. They were constantly under guard by armed white overseers and their assistants, the gangers. The supervisory staff frequently used severe violence to force unwilling servants to toil or to maintain a faster pace as they weeded the large cane fields.[43]
 Increasingly from the ‘Consolidation Phase’ onwards, ‘time-expired’ workers (the contemporary term for Pacific Islanders who had completed their first three year term of indenture) chose other forms of labour rather than submit to the hated gang system. The conservative Legislative Councillor, A.J. Thynne, told his parliamentary colleagues in 1884 that he employed a ‘time-expired’ Melanesian as a sugar-boiler at £3 per week.[44]
 This was an unusual though by no means isolated case. Rather, most Islanders in this category would engage for short-term contracts as cane- carters, as unskilled or semi-skilled mill operators, or leave the plantation structure altogether and engage as casual labourers on farms and in the townships.
 In the years 1883 to 1884, attempts were made in several directions to ensure a continuance of reliable and cheap labour. First, labour recruiters were urged to be more diligent in the efforts to persuade Islanders to come to Queensland. The number of New Hebrides and Solomon Islanders rose from 1499 to 2542 and 61 to 1028 respectively in the years 1880 to 1883 (see appendix 1). Despite these substantial augmentations in the supply, this did not satisfy the demand. Recruiters went into the hitherto unexploited islands of New Britain, New Ireland, and the Louisiade and D’Entrecasteaux groups where the people had experienced only very sporadic contact with European traders and missionaries. In the years 1883 to 1885 nearly three thousand people from these areas were kidnapped, duped and treated with ferocious barbarity in order to augment the Queensland labour force.[45] Yet after ‘recruiters’ had fraudulently and violently obtained these ‘recruits’, they did not provide the solution to the industry’s labour shortage. Usually, newly- introduced recruits were ‘seasoned’. As Edward Denman of Etowi estate at


-----

##### Mackay explained: ‘for the first twelve months, the South Sea Islander is of very little use and requires great care and consideration.’[46] On large estates such as those owned by the conglomerate, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR), this procedure was invariably adhered to, but in the desperate demand for labour in these years many other planters directed their field staff to avoid this costly procedure. Subsequently, these Islanders died at the alarming rate of 147 per 1000 per annum.[47]
 Thirdly, the Pacific Island Labourers Act of 1880, which required that all first contract indentured servants be confined within tropical agriculture, was amended in 1884 providing three distinct labour categories. Those Melanesians who had been continuously resident in the colony since 1 September 1879 were given exemption tickets. Eight hundred and thirty-five were issued.[48] Ticket-holders were exempt from all restrictive provisions of the Pacific Island Labourers Act and could engage in any type of work, for how ever long they wished and at mutually agreed wages. All first-term workers were still required to serve an initial term of three years but ‘time- expired’ workers were not. They could choose new employers if they wished and bargain for shorter contracts. Most chose to work on six to twelve months contracts. But what was particularly significant was the stipulation that all Melanesians, except those with ‘tickets’, were henceforth legally obliged to perform only routine and menial labour in tropical agriculture. They were expressly forbidden to work as mill operatives, carriers, domestic servants and tradesmen. This legislation had been passed by the Liberal government, headed by Samuel Walker Griffith (who was later to draft the Commonwealth Constitution and become the first Chief Justice of the High Court). It was intended to segregate and contain most Pacific Islanders within one specified labour category in one industry. The Liberals’ motives were complex. First, they required the electoral support of recently enfranchised white working class men who feared competition with imported cheaper labour. Secondly, the Liberals were committed to the eventual establishment of a ‘White Australia’ and this was one step towards its realisation. They feared that a progressive more democratic society based upon a free British-derived population would be threatened and contaminated by all non-whites. Unwittingly, their racial ideology (which supported temporary segregation before virtual exclusion) allowed them to implement a policy which reinforced the very structures they strove to destroy. They were, in effect, ensuring that the sugar industry was not


-----

##### deprived of its labour force which would have been dispersed into more remunerative areas within the overall colonial economy. By designating that Islanders could only perform menial field tasks they were again reinforcing the hierarchical structure of the plantation by specifically outlawing upward socio-economic mobility. These non-Europeans were to be maintained legally in the rigorous caste-structure operating on the large estates. These two factors reinforced the economic ascendency of their political rivals, the conservatives, whose vision for Queensland was totally anti-democratic, for they wanted a small, wealthy coterie of British aristocrats and members of the bourgeosie to rule over vast armies of non-European indentured servants who were without any political and civil rights.
 Meanwhile, on the plantations, the proprietors in their haste to maximise profits and minimise costs now the Liberals had helped to stabilise their servile labour force, continued their cost minimisation strategies, such as providing the cheapest and unwholesome food (to such an extent that many Islanders spent most of their leisure time hunting birds and animals and fishing in order to survive); encouraging Melanesians to construct their own dwellings from cane sheaves and local unwanted material; to wear little clothing whilst working (though this could result in abrasions which would become easily infected in a tropical climate) and purchase their own clothes for their leisure time.[49] The planters were in a furore when the Liberals increased the capitation fee from 10/- to 60/- per Islander, in order to pay for the four government-run hospitals for Melanesians which were established in 1883.[50]
 The other main strategy which the planters employed was to secure alternative sources of labour. The Aborigines, as a hunting and gathering people, unlike the Melanesians from a peasant culture, did not possess the production and exchange relations or social organisation of even primitive capitalism. Structurally, they were not very effectively able to make the transition from hunter and forager to disciplined field labourer or wage labourer.[51] The Queensland frontier had been particularly brutal, so that in most instances, planters found it difficult to coerce surviving Aborigines to work. In the ecologically arid western areas of the colony, the Aborigines, deprived of their water supplies by the conquering pastoralists, had little alternative but to become herdsmen, herdswomen and domestic servants. Also, the more seasonal nature of a pastoral economy could be more readily adapted to the blacks’ former intricate nomadic patterns.[52] However, in the


-----

##### 1870s Aborigines from the Mackay Reserve had been used as an extra pool of labour, performing a variety of seasonally-determined tasks on the local plantations.[53] CSR’s extensive estates, Goondi and Mourilyan at Innisfail each employed fifty Aborigines.[54]
 As the Aborigines and Pacific Islanders could not provide the necessary number of labourers during the expansionist phase, the planters strove to find other suitable forms. In 1882 CSR’s Victoria estate on the Herbert River employed Chinese workers, though they were not allocated routine field production tasks but were made to construct drainage canals and tramway tracks. They were not cheap by any means, for most commanded 25/-per week plus rations, a common rate for white labourers.[55] Having mostly arrived as miners bound for the Palmer River diggings in the late 1870s and not specifically imported as indentured servants, they were not particularly amenable to plantation discipline. Moreover they could readily escape into the urban Chinese community. In 1880, 866 Javanese labourers arrived to work on CSR’s estates, but they were notably more expensive, at 6/9 per week than Islanders and they more frequently absconded.[56] In addition, Malays and ‘coolies’ from Singapore and Hong Kong were imported. Japanese were introduced primarily as domestics, laundrymen and skilled mill workers (especially centrifugal press operators).

 Table 8.3: Ethnic Origins of Labour Force in Queensland Sugar Industry in 1888


-----

##### The plantation structure, before its spectacular demise in the late 1880s and despite its manifold inefficiencies, comprised highly integrated systems. Each estate operated as a self-contained production unit, arranged along orderly, neat physical dimensions. Arthur Neame, who established Macknade which CSR later purchased, wrote that:

 I have laid out the plantation so that each block measures ten acres, the roads around each being 15ft. in width, a block on the river bank is reserved for the mill house, and most of the buildings for the men, the overseers and the staff, and cottages for the married people will be around this block.[57]

 The mill would invariably be placed near the river for easy and less expensive transportation. Buildings would usually be placed according to their relationship to production. Al Goondi these were constructed around a central parade ground where the overseers and gangers could muster the field-workers in a regimented manner, inspect them and give orders.[58] The government Inspectors of Pacific Islanders would conduct their twice yearly inspections when pay was distributed and complaints could be made.


-----

##### The whole operation was supervised by the manager, who might have two assistants. They would superintend both the operation of the field and the mill. One of the most important ‘officers’ (as CSR dubbed its supervisory staff) was the cultivation overseer who, as veteran West Indian planter and long-time resident in Queensland, John Buhot, remarked:

 On well ordered estates he places upon the manager’s table each morning an account of the work, not only of the gangs of labourers in his charge but of the work of individuals; lays out tasks and keeps a general account of the work done ... At 4pm he lays a detailed report again which ... are then taken to the bookkeeper, and by him the days work is credited and stoppages noted.[59]

 A well-organised plantation would be run along military lines, with its officers, NCOs and men representing a highly-defined class and caste system. Claudius Whish, granduncle of Australia’s first Governor-General, Lord Hopetown, who had seen active service in India, stated that he had found it an indispensable background for his later vocation as a planter in Queensland.[60] Orders were given and put into effect in a military manner, with parades, drill and vigorous supervision being an essential component of day-to-day life. The various ethnic groups lived in separate accommodation; the Melanesian usually in large barracks, for it was easy for the overseers to force them out in the morning for parade. The white staff were allocated houses according to their status, with the managers having well-appointed comfortable homes with Asian servants whilst white mill operatives would live in the European barracks (if single) and in a tiny cottage (if married).
 The various ethnic groups on the large estates would be designated specific occupational tasks and were also housed separately. Amongst the Melanesian community, Solomon Islanders would normally reside away from the New Hebrideans. Yet intertribal and inter-ethnic hostility was a daily occurrence. After serious inter-tribal fighting erupted on CSR’s Victoria estate in 1883, the company instructed its managers:

 ... to make it a rule not to allow the boys to take their tools into the houses, but to have a small shed erected specially for the purpose and provided with a lock and key.[61]


-----

##### In 1885 at Pioneer plantation on the Burdekin River a group of Malaitans and Chinese fought with mat-locks, tomahawks, bows and arrows and pick- handles. The field supervisor sent in a squad of Tannese to disrupt the brawl.[62] Clearly, these antagonisms deflected tension away from the white masters.
 In 1885 a series of complex political and economic factors converged in Queensland to promote profound structural changes in the sugar industry. In the previous year the price of sugar on the London market had plummeted to the unprecedented low of 13/3 per cwt.[63] During this decade the proportion of German and French beet sugar began to exceed the tropically-produced cane sugar. Distant Queensland was not immune from its effects. But during the optimistic and expansionist period of the early years of the decade, serious structural problems within the entire industry had been detected. The very detailed evidence presented to the 1889 Royal Commission to enquire into the depression in the industry demonstrated that far too much investment was channeled into the purchase and clearing of large tracts of virgin scrub rather than the acquisition of sophisticated technology and scientifically- trained staff.
 The Liberals in 1885 passed an Act to prohibit the further introduction of Pacific Islanders into the colony after 1890, which caused considerable apprehension amongst the already anxious planters whose efforts to retain ‘time-expired’ workers and secure Asian labourers had become all the more urgent. This government passed legislation which established two experimental central mills. Racecourse and North Eton at Mackay. Since 1876 the Land Act made the purchase of small selections more feasible, the number of modestly-endowed cane farmers had substantially increased. During the ‘Speculative Phase’, 1879-1885, many new farmers found themselves at the mercy of the planters upon whom they relied to crush their crop. Since cane needed to be harvested within twenty-four hours of cutting, a farmer needed to be certain his cane would be crushed that day. But since the planters had no need to compete with each other for the farmers’ patronage, each selector usually had to make the best arrangement he could with the nearest planter, who often refused to bind himself to a contract with farmers. As one selector told the 1889 Royal Commission:

 The central mill will give as much as can be given to the farmers who are growing cane for it. As it was before, the planters had it all in their hands.


-----

##### If I was a farmer close to the mill, I had to depend on the mill only and the planter gave me 7s. or 8s. or 9s. a ton for my cane and I had to sell it or let it stand.[64]

 The Liberal’s policy aided the development of an economic infrastructure which would allow yeomen farmers and their families to prosper. This legislation was unable to come to terms with the complexity of the inherent structural difficulties. It was the deepening depression in the industry, which heralded an intense Australia-wide depression, which changed the fundamental structure. As early as 1884, when sugar prices fell, Edward Long, the prominent conservative parliamentarian subdivided Habana estate at Mackay, so that he controlled only the milling of the cane and left the onerous responsibility of its production to small tenant farmers.[65] The powerful CSR followed suit, subdividing Homebush also at Mackay in 1891. By the early 1890s few plantations retained the structure of the buoyant expansionist era.
 The 1889 Royal Commission had endorsed this structural change, though there was basic disagreement between the commissioners on the question of coloured labour. Henry King and Alfred Cowley, both with long associations with sugar, argued that cheap, imported servile labour was absolutely necessary if the industry was to survive. The chairman, William Brookes, a staunch Liberal, issued a separate report recommending that in future only white labour be used. When the general depression strengthened, Griffith joined with his former political adversary, Sir Thomas McIlwraith, to form a coalition government. Increasing pressure from the northern separationists, mainly wealthy planters, could not be ignored, especially because of their influence in Britain, where they continued to press for a separate colony. Griffith issued his ‘Manifesto to the People of Queensland’ which contained proposals to reintroduce Melanesians for ten years. This dramatic volte face argued that this was merely a ‘temporary and transitional expedient’. Griffith added that he was still a determined opponent of non-European servile labour in the colony, but had been driven to this seemingly inconceivable move by the desperate times.[66]
 In 1893 The Sugar Works Guarantee Act was passed providing for the establishment of twelve more central mills which were initially financed by the government. These were far more efficient than the old plantation mills. In 1884-5 when there were 166 crushing mills, 368, 626 cwt of sugar was

##### exported from the colony. Fifteen years later, when there were sixty-two mills, 2, 461, 150 cwt were exported (see appendix 3). In 1892 there were 450 sugar farmers in Queensland and five years later there were 1450. There was a proportional increase in the number of employers of Pacific Islanders, rising from 195 to 1264 in those years when Melanesian numbers fluctuated between 7489 and 8795.

 Table 8.4: Size of Farms and Plantations, Queensland 1900

 When the classic plantation system was in operation, Pacific Islanders were usually employed in gangs at the rate of one to four or five acres under cultivation.[68] Hambledon estate in Cairns, which had 900 acres planted, engaged 176 Melanesians, but this was a lower ratio than usual.[69] In comparison to the small farm/‘central’ mill system it was costly and inefficient. in this new system a ratio of only one worker per ten acres was required.[70] It would seem that Pacific Island labour was more experienced in


-----

##### sugar production by the late 1880s, as at least fifty percent were ‘time- expired’ workers (see appendix 1). In 1896, there were 763 introductions and 4773 re-engagements. Many were able to obtain 20/- to 25/- per week, a rate commensurate with that of white workers. With the transformation of the basic infrastructure, important changes can be detected in the patterns of labour. Although Islanders could earn higher wages, especially if they signed-on for a short-term contract with a new master, many were increasingly resentful. Most were legally still indentured servants. (Technically white and Asian workers were under the auspices of the Masters and Servants Act of 1861 as well.) Ackoa of Vanna Lava Island, speaking on behalf of many compatriots, asserted that:

 We want to be free labourers and do any work we can. We don’t want contracts. We say that as we do the same work that Hindoos (sic) and whitemen do, we should get the same wages as them.[71]

 Another Hebridean, Fred Tanna, stated that he worked for a Chinese farmer who did not demand a term of indenture and ‘plenty boy work like that’.[72]
 By the late 1880s and early 1890s, Pacific Islanders were becoming increasingly organised and assertive:

 They organise, keep up the rate of wages, have their alliances or unions, travel from place to place in search of better pay, communicate with each other by letter or wire.[73]

 At the same time, with the demise of the plantation system and gang labour, white workers felt it was no longer demeaning to their racial pride to engage as labourers in the cane fields. Formerly, any European who worked as a routine labourer in the industry alongside blacks or Asians was castigated as a ‘mean white’. With the depression in the pastoral and related transport industry from 1890, unemployed unskilled itinerant white people sought work in the sugar industry. CSR employed an experimental group of cane-cutters at Homebush in 1894 who were paid 3/6 per ton. They were not reliable workers as they frequently ‘knocked off’, and were replaced by Chinese labourers.[74] Dr Walter Maxwell, the Director of the Sugar Experimental Bureau calculated that 409 men were used to maintain only eighty-eight positions.[75]


-----

##### Gradually white workers began to organise their working procedures rather in the same manner as the ‘time-expired’ Melanesians had already done. The main organisation was called the ‘butty gang’ and it consisted of a number of cane cutters who would make a specific contract with a farmer to cut his cane at so much per ton. The team would share their earnings (along with the cook). The number in each gang decreased as workers obtained more skill at the arduous labour required to cut and trash cane. Initially, it would seem farmers would hire a team of twenty men in the early 1890s but this had decreased to twelve by 1906 and seven members six years later.[76] A farmer would normally retain around 20% of earnings until the contract was completed in order to ensure the members did not abscond. This system had very beneficial pecuniary effects as far as the employer was concerned. Unlike the old indenture system of Melanesians where masters had to pay recruiting costs, government capitation fees, as well as the expense of monitoring and supervising the daily output of servants in the field, the ‘butty gang’ system was internally controlled by its own members. It saved the employer money in two particular areas - he did not have to recruit or supervise this labour. If a team member of a ‘butty gang’ was unable to keep the pace of his fellows or was a ‘shirker’, he would be dismissed and replaced, a procedure that was not possible in the plantation gang system where the whip was the incentive to continue working at a specified pace.
 By the late 1890s political forces within Australia generally were gathering a momentum which would insist upon a ‘white’ continent, and in particular the expulsion of the Pacific Islanders from the Queensland sugar industry. As Robert Huttenback states:

 Of all the constituent parts of the British Empire, Australia ... seemed to make [itself a] ... bastion of Anglo-Saxon civilization preserved forever against the coloured races of the world.[77]

 The recently-established Commonwealth Government moved swiftly to introduce the Immigration Restriction Act (no.17 of 1901) where all intending immigrants were required to pass a written test of fifty words in English (and later any European language). This ‘Natal Formula’ had been in operation in some colonies since 1897. The Pacific Island Labourers Act of 1901 required that no more Melanesians enter Australia after 31 December 1904 and provided for their mass deportation in 1906 and 1907. This bill was passed without a division and as Peter Corris comments, ‘there were


-----

##### speeches made about it rather than debates upon it’.[78] Australian nationhood was to be accomplished by purging and expelling those people who, by their ethnic origins, were regarded as culturally, socially and biologically inferior to the dominant British.
 Although various humanitarian groups like the Aborigines Protection Society, some clergy and the various Pacific Islander organisations protested that the Commonwealth’s actions were illegal, improper and inhumane, the most vocal opposition emanated from the vested sugar interests. The Queensland premier, Sir Robert Philp, a former merchant with extensive interests in the sugar industry, continually reminded the Federal government that unless generous tariffs were implemented, sugar production would collapse without cheap black labour. Altogether, it was a rather spurious argument, for evidence already presented in this essay demonstrates that Melanesians by this time could generally earn wages comparable to white cane cutters. The Commonwealth passed the Excise Tariff Act of 1902 which placed an excise of £3 per ton on sugar grown by white labour until 1 January 1907. A protective tariff of £6 and £10 per ton was placed on foreign grown cane and beet sugar respectively. Cane growers who employed white cane cutters were awarded a bonus of 4/- to 5/- per ton in 1901. It was increased to 6/- to 7/6 per ton four years later.[79]
 Despite these provisions, Melanesians continued as the main source of cane cutters and sugar farm labourers. Many growers in the far north, hostile to the Commonwealth’s legislation, defiantly used Island labour exclusively. Statistics verify this pattern, for it is shown that most non-European labour was utilised in the far north.[80]

 Table 8.5: Proportion of Cane Harvested by White Labour in Queensland, 1904


-----

##### Delegates to the 1904 conference of cane farmers and millers declared that more financial incentives were necessary if white workers were to be attracted to the industry.[81] in 1901 there were 9324 Melanesians in Queensland, though by 1906 this had been decreased to 6389. A further 691 still held exemption tickets and a further 768 were aged between ten and fifteen and had presumably been born in Queensland. These persons as well as younger children born in Australia could not be deported. In 1906 the Queensland government, after a Royal Commission into the proposed deportation, recommended that the Federal authorities relax their strictures. In all 4269 persons were deported in 1906 and 1907.[82]
 Moves were also being made to improve the material conditions for white workers in the sugar industry. In 1905 the Shearers ’ and Sugar Workers ’ Accommodation Act was passed, proclaiming minimum sanitary and accommodation conditions. It was no coincidence that the years 1906 and 1907 witnessed the substantial transition from black to white labour in the cane fields. In 1906 the Sugar Workers Union was formed in Cairns and Mackay, for white workers only.[83] In 1906 white field workers in Bundaberg went on strike for better conditions.[84] That year the federal government increased the bounty from £3 to £4 a ton. In order to qualify, farmers had to pay labourers 22/6 plus ‘found’ per week in the off-season and 25/- in the harvesting period. Dr Maxwell estimated that wages of mill operatives rose by twenty-five per cent from 1905 to 1908.[85] In 1911 the white sugar workers (now in the Amalgamated Workers’ Association [AWA]) went on strike in all districts, except Maryborough, demanding an eight hour day and a minimum of 30/- per week. Companies such as CSR charged striking mill operatives with offences under the Masters and Servants Act. In a number of


-----

##### test cases before the Queensland Supreme Court, it was ruled that this Act no longer applied to white workers and was eventually rescinded by the newly elected Labor government in 1916.[86] White workers, whilst using this strike to illustrate their status as militant, organised unionists in contrast to supposedly unorganised dispirited indentured servants, also proclaimed their allegiance to a ‘White Australia’ policy and a ‘white’ sugar industry in particular. These mills were all owned by CSR, which continued to use non- European labour, a policy which had been abandoned in the state-financed central mills. CSR paid its Japanese centrifugal press operators at Goondi 34/4 per week and ‘found’ whilst Europeans got 30/-.[87] Clearly non- Europeans were not a form of cheap labour under-cutting white workers. In the 1911 confrontation Asians continued to work, thereby being castigated as ‘scab’ labourers. Unionists disregarded the fact that their union allowed only Europeans to join. The unionists’ antagonisms were racial, as Frederick Martin, an AWA secretary stated:

 These coloured people are unnecessary and a grave racial evil. They keep quarters which is [sic] ... a disgrace to any civilised community. I would not care how ... [the Japanese] are got rid of, so long as [they] ... are.[88]

 In August 1911 an agreement between the AWA and the Australian Sugar Producers’ Association was reached, giving mill workers a minimum wage of 30/- per forty-eight hour working week, but left field workers to make private agreements with farmers. Both groups were fiercely determined to impress upon both their employers and the public mind that they represented a ‘superior’ racial and industrial category. Their antagonisms to the newly- imported Italian workers who acted as a transitional category between servile non-white and militant white unionised labour was also apparent. The sugar workers’ refusal to accord non-British labourers the status of members of the working class like themselves betrayed a central weakness; it allowed more vulnerable groups of alien workers to be exploited by the employers without recourse to those sophisticated mechanisms of industrial relations, like the Conciliation and Arbitration Courts, which characterised the new Commonwealth.

 Table 8.6: Racial Composition of Selected Sugar Mills in Queensland in 1911

##### Two years later, a series of Acts further diminished the position of non- white workers in the sugar industry. The Sugar Growers ’ Act of 1913 provided for the prompt payment to cane suppliers of a part of the value of the crop by millers. In the 1911 strike small-scale cane farmers had voiced their manifold grievances against both the private mills and many ‘central’ mills which were controlled by a small group of farmers to the detriment of their fellows. This Act sought to alleviate one major area of disharmony. Secondly, the Sugar Employees Act made temporary provision for wages and conditions for white workers, until these could be standardised by Awards under the regulations of the Industrial Peace Act of 1912.[89] But the most crucial legislation was contained in the Sugar Cultivation Act of 1913 which required all non-British aliens to pass a dictation test in any language as the Secretary for Agriculture might decide. As Easterby stated:

 The object of this Act was to shut out certain coloured labour or aliens as might be required, or to prevent such persons from owning or cultivating


-----

##### land for sugar cane - all this in furtherance of the growing of cane by white labour.[90]

 Though the Commonwealth legislation provided for a dictation test for any intending immigrant into Australia, only Queensland maintained legislation with similar provisions and methods which related only to internal domestic issues. Other subsequent legislation like the Banana Industry Preservation Act of 1913 further restricted the right of the non-British to work in tropical agriculture. The Agricultural Bank Act Amendment Act of 1904 specified that aliens were not eligible for loans whilst the Lands Act of 1910 and the Leases to Aliens Restriction Act of 1911 curtailed the rights of Asians and Pacific Islanders to become leaseholders. Persons of non-European descent were further restricted in employment under the Dairy Produce Act 1904-1920, the Margarine Act of 1910-1930, the Queensland Local Authority Act 1902- 1920 (railway, bus and tramway employment) whilst the Queensland Mining Act 1899-1930 forbade unnaturalised non-whites from obtaining mining leases. The Sugar Cultivation Act required aliens who wanted exemptions to apply before the end of 1913. There were subsequently many cases of extreme hardship, for no more tickets were issued after 1914 and many people, not understanding the bureaucratic procedures, did not correctly apply. If found working in the industry without a ticket they were fined by the police or the Department of Agriculture. The Labor government which came to power in 1915 was adamant in its refusal to grant more exemptions. In all, 1654 exemptions were issued.[91] (See Table 8.7). This means that most aliens who applied for an exemption as required under the Act were granted it, for the 1911 Census of the Commonwealth which gave the most accurate figures revealed there were 1735 Asians and Islanders in the sugar districts. (See Table 8.8).
 Despite the severity of those Acts, the unions, in particular the powerful AWU, were still campaigning throughout the war years to expel all Asians from Queensland. Strikes were frequently threatened ‘if coloured aliens are not removed at once’.[92] With the intense ideological and class conflict of the war years escalating after 1918,[93] the sugar industry was to prove a significant industrial battleground; but rather than pursue direct action against monopolies like CSR, the AWU continued to deflect attention away from class issues and reassert their traditional preoccupation with racial


-----

##### exclusiveness and xenophobia. Thomas Quilty, the AWU organiser at Cairns, wrote to the Minister for Agriculture in February 1919 stating that:

 I have received numerous complaints and the menace seems to becoming greater every year and areas that were practically all white previously are now employing coloured aliens. Hambledon, Babinda and the Innisfail areas have always been overrun with Asiatic labour, but Mulgrave was always a mill that employed all whites; but now there are indications that it is going to be engulfed in coloured ocean like the others. The situation is a very serious one for us, and unless something is done, it will only be a matter of time till the sugar industry is a coloured one again.[94]

 The Permanent Under Secretary of the Agriculture Department replied that the Minister ‘had every sympathy with your point of view’.

##### The unions considered it necessary, especially ‘in view of the sacrifices of Australian soldiers’, which supposedly intensified antagonisms against the non-British segment of the population, to fight even more vigilantly to obtain a ‘white’Queensland.[95] The Indian Overseas Association protested to the Prime Minister in August 1920 that, in view of the Indians’ contribution to the war effort, it was regrettable that these British subjects were discriminated against in the Queensland sugar industry. They resented the


-----

##### concession given to the non-British Japanese primarily for reasons of international diplomacy.[96] The AWU began a campaign of harrassment against non-British aliens and their employers. William Storrie, the organiser at Ayr, was concerned that twenty Japanese men were working at Inkerman mill and on the tramways. It was an affront with so many ‘unemployed looking for work’. Though frequently the unions and the returned servicemen’s organisation were enqaged in bitter ideological conflict, in this instance there was harmony and agreement that Queensland was the home of the British. Storrie continued that the RSL (the Returned Servicemen’s League) ‘wants something done’.[97]
 The union organisers would make surprise visits to farmers suspected of employing Asians or Islanders without exemption tickets. The Innisfail official, Quilty, must have been particularly vigilant and increased the police workload; for when he reported, in October 1917, a qang labouring outside the award hours, the local sergeant simply refused to investigate.[98] As well as this, the AWU pressed the local inspectors of Factories and Shops, who were to superintend the regulations of the Sugar Cultivation Act of 1913, to be particularly zealous in detecting illegal labour. The Chief Inspector in Brisbane wrote that his officers could not cope with all the AWU complaints and suggested the police give more assistance.[99] When such complaints were made, a prosecution was often difficult. William Watt, the energetic and often overworked inspector at Innisfail reported that he.came across two Malays in a canefield who ‘denied working at all despite the firmly chipped ground’. The most implausible stories were offered explaining their presence in the canefields.[100] The other difficulty involved the non-cooperation of employers. As the Under Chief Secretary reported:

 It is thouqht that in some cases, coloured men have a secret agreement with their employers which enables them to work at less rates than those prescribed by the sugar industry awards.[101]

 Some farmers were very sympathetic to the plight of Pacific Islanders without exemption tickets who could not perform their accustomed duties cultivating and cutting cane. Fearful of incurring the emnity of the unions and fines by the Factory Inspectors, some farmers engaged Melanesians to work at night. Noel Fatnowa, a descendant of the Malaitans at Mackay, said his parents would leave their children and venture to the silent canefields and

##### aided only by the light of the stars and the moon, they would stealthily strip, trash and cut the cane.[102]
 The Queensland sugar industry by the 1920s had undergone extraordinary transformations and was virtually organised on the principle of white labour only, thereby rendering it unique. This dedication to an organised, militant white workforce was all the more unusual in that only eighty years previously Australia possessed an extensive form of quasi-slavery and forty years later, Queensland still operated a fully matured classical plantation system. Unlike other sugar producing colonies in the British Empire, Queensland was a ‘settler society’, dominated by a British derived population and British social institutions. The commitment of the Commonwealth of Australia to a ‘White Australia’ policy in 1901 further accelerated the process of structural change in the sugar industry by outlawing the expansion of Melanesian indenture and gradually introducing a viable white labour force.

 CHINESE INDENTURED LABOUR IN THE TRANSVAAL GOLD MINING INDUSTRY, 1904-1910

 Peter Richardson

##### Asia has been a source of labour supply for South Africa since the seventeenth century. Within a few years of the Dutch settlement of the Cape, slaves were imported from the Malayan archipelago to satisfy demand for continous labour which could not be supplied by the indigenous African population. For close on one hundred and fifty years the Cape ‘Malay’ population formed the only Asian element within the Dutch settlement area.[1] In the mid-nineteenth century, however, with the extension of European colonisation beyond the Orange and the Vaal rivers and across the Drakensburg mountains into present-day Natal, the demand for a regular labouring population to work on European-owned land turned attention once again to the labour reservoirs of the Asian continent.
 In line with other tropical-produce colonies in the mid-nineteenth century, Natal looked not to the south-eastern areas of Asia, but to India. Early in the 1850s, a deputation of coast planters sought government help in arranging for the introduction of Indian indentured labourers to meet the growing shortage of labour in the sub-tropical coastal districts.[2] After fairly protracted negotiations, Indian government sanction was obtained, and importation began in 1860. This continued until 1866 when a severe depression in the Colony led the planters to request the cessation of the trade. This was resumed in 1874 with the return of prosperity and continued, with only a short break in 1886, until 1911, when the Government of India refused to permit any further indentured emigration to Natal.[3]
 Like the Cape, the colony of Natal had sought labour from Asia on conditions of service that would provide the settlers with sufficient cheap unskilled labour on a regular basis to meet the need created by commercial cultivation of tropical crops. Cash cropping in these areas was particularly

##### concerned with sugar production, although tea was a significant crop from the 1870s onwards.[4] The development of the Natal midlands was also associated with a growing demand for Indian labour, although on a much smaller scale. The surge of growth in the two maritime colonies of the Cape and Natal which followed the discovery of diamonds in Griqualand West, resulted in further demand for Indian labour, this time to construct railways, harbours and other public works. Consequently, from the 1870s the demand came increasingly from industrial enterprises associated with this expansion, rather than from the agricultural sector as hitherto. In the 1880s, the discovery of large coal reserves in the northern areas of Natal further emphasised this changing pattern of demand. With the growing use of coal as fuel to drive the steam machinery on the mines of Kimberley and, after 1886, the Witwatersrand, the Natal collieries found a ready and expanding market for their produce.[5] The direct association of indentured labour with the burgeoning mining industry of South Africa was significantly enlarged by the exploitation of extensive gold deposits of payable ore on the Witwatersrand in the Transvaal after 1886. Within thirteen years of the declaration of the Witwatersrand as a public digging, the South African Republic had become the largest single source of gold production in the world. By the time of Union (1910), no less than 35 per cent of all new gold came from this one source. A development of this magnitude was based on the enormous extent of the gold deposits of the Witwatersrand and upon the conquest of the technological problems of recovering gold from pyritic or refractory ores, most strikingly illustrated in the widespread use of the Macarthur-Forrest cyanide process after 1891. This latter development, and the extensive capital investment in sophisticated machinery which accompanied it, led eventually to the economic exploitation of lower grade deposits, and made possible the extension of payable ground along the East and West Rand, beyond the rich central section around Johannesburg.[6]
 The scale of mining which derived from these processes can be deduced from bare statistics of its operations. In 1887 total Transvaal output of gold was 39, 880 fine ounces worth £169, 401. By 1899 this figure had increased to 3, 637, 713 fine ounces at a value of £15, 452, 025. By 1909 this figure had doubled to 7, 295, 108 fine ounces, worth £30, 987, 656. Similarly, the number of African miners employed increased from 14, 000 in 1887 to 99, 000 in 1899 and to 155, 000 in 1909. In 1907, the total output of 6.4 million fine ounces of gold required the milling of 25.6 million tons of gold ore.


-----

##### Not surprisingly, the amount of capital invested, which was primarily controlled by large finance houses or Groups, was very great - by 1900 £77.4 million at par had been subscribed, a figure which had increased to £121.4 million by 1910. Between 1886 and 1910 not less than £77.2 million had been distributed in dividends.[7]
 The regional impact of this development was such that recruiting agents were soon scouring the whole of the southern African sub-continent in an attempt to meet the demand for cheap unskilled mine labour. One solution to this problem was found in the indenturing of very large numbers of African miners from the southern provinces of Portuguese East Africa. The populous areas of Gaza, Inhambane, and Lourenco Marques south of Lat.22° South, provided the mining industry with its largest single source of long-contract labour in the period 1886-1914. At the time of Union, half of the industry’s African labour force was made up of so-called ‘East Coast Natives’.[8] Nevertheless, this successful utilisation of indenture to provide a stabilising element to the mine workforce only partially met the labour demands of the industry. The volume of production in the gold mining industry, the development of competitive demands for labour from European agriculture and the continuing vitality of African production, ensured that labour shortage was virtually endemic in the mining industry.
 This situation was transformed by the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902. As a result of the conflict, a labour force which had been barely adequate, was dispersed as mines were forced to close for the duration. At the same time, the mineowners compounded their own difficulties by announcing a wage reduction in 1900 to become effective once the war had ceased. This was to be implemented by the newly formed Witwatersrand Native Labour Association [WNLA]. The effects of this development were soon felt in the immediate post-war period as a large amount of labour was required to undertake reconstruction and to expand infrastructural development planned by the newly installed British administration.[9] Such increased demand occurred at a time of diminished supply largely as a result of a series of good harvests in African areas and high prices emanating from military needs. Nor could the mineowners strengthen their position by relying on the state to force out African labour. Such an apparatus simply did not exist in the immediate aftermath of the war, and was furthermore politically unacceptable because of the likelihood of it provoking an African rising.[10]

##### The resultant shortage of labour in the gold mining industry led ultimately to the decision to turn once again to Asia, this time to import Chinese miners on three year indentures. Such an outcome has been taken as indicative of a labour crisis in the Transvaal at this time. This view, shared by most contemporaries, has been endorsed frequently by historians.[11] Yet an examination of events leading to the importation of the Chinese suggests that labour shortage, although real enough, was only part of a more fundamental crisis of accumulation in the industry, associated with an enforced transition to lower grade deep level mining. Another manifestation of this was a long term fall in the rate of profit. As this is not a generally accepted view of the so-called Reconstruction Period (1901-6), but is central to an understanding of the role of Chinese labour in the mining industry, it is now necessary to examine the claim more closely.
 The mining industry’s response to the labour shortage must be sought not only in the dispersal of the mine labour force by the authorities of the South African Republic in 1899, and in the decision by WNLA to reduce African wages, but also in the effects of the War itself upon the capital structure of the mining industry. With the cessation of mining in 1899, output plummeted and dividends virtually ceased. Appropriation of surplus revenue for internally generated investment likewise slumped, whilst debts and interest payments accumulated and payment on debentures fell into arrears, stocks of gold were exhausted and overheads increased. In financial terms the industry estimated it had incurred a direct loss of £6.9 million, and an indirect loss of £25 million as a result of the War.[12] Nevertheless, investment in the form of new working capital continued to be subscribed in London, Paris and Berlin. Much of this capital was speculative, encouraged by the prospect of a British government in the Transvaal, and was ear-marked for new or developing companies. There were two phases to this inflow. In 1899, in anticipation of a quick British victory, funds came in in quite substantial amounts. These dried up when it became clear that the struggle was going to be prolonged. However, in 1902, after the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging, the process began again. In the short lived boom which followed, some £10.2 million was brought into the industry as working capital, and a further £5.5 million as vendors’ interests. In 1902 alone no fewer than 299 new companies were floated.[13]
 The intensifying demands for the profitable employment of this new capital and attempts to recoup some of the war-time losses argued for a


-----

##### rapid and extensive restarting of mining operations. The difficulty was that in the conditions of the war-torn Transvaal, the means were not immediately available. However, the pressures operating on the mining companies were such that the condition of the country did not stop them attempting to implement this policy. This can be seen in a series of crucial decisions which were undertaken at this time. Thus, the attempt by WNLA to reduce wages not only held out the prospect of an immediate reduction in working costs, but implied an extensive labour supply at reduced rates which encouraged much new investment. The companies built on this situation in May 1901, when, with the limited restarting of mining operations, they decided to distribute all available labour to the widest range of producing companies. This policy was continued until November 1903, when automatic preference for individual crushing companies was suspended and distribution given over to the parent Groups. An essential underpinning of this strategy was preference for Transvaal coal companies which were members of WNLA, to enable them to supply fuel to the gold mines.[14]
 In response to these initiatives, in a period of eight months between December 1901 and July 1902, thirty-five companies restarted mining operations, 1, 632 stamps came into operation and the monthly output of gold increased by 182 per cent.[15] At the same time, companies curtailed sorting of waste rock to economise on labour and introduced a sizeable number of large-machine drills, often operated by more expensive unskilled white labour. The net result was a dramatic fall in working profits, for the intermix of waste rock was increased by the suspension of sorting, and a larger amount of non-ore bearing rock was mined by use of machine drills. Between December 1901 and 1902, the grade of ore treated fell by 7s.3d per ton whilst costs fell much less sharply.[16]
 This development would not necessarily have been serious if it had been accompanied by a commensurate fall in the wage element of working costs or a sharp rise in the purchasing power of gold. The reverse of these two things happened. African wage rates rose constantly under the pressure of competitive demand from within the industry and from other sources, whilst no cheaper alternative form of unskilled labour was immediately available. Thus between 1901-2 and 1903-4, the average monthly wage paid to African miners rose from 26s.8d to 48s.10d.[17] At the same time the purchasing power of gold fell to an all-time low since mining operations had commenced on the Witwatersrand. In 1902-3, the value of gold was


-----

##### thirty-eight index points below its immediate pre-War level. Despite a slight rise thereafter, this was never sufficient to offset a rise in working costs emanating from escalating food and wage costs.[18]
 As early as mid-1902 the effects of this profit squeeze could no longer be ignored. In August 1902, the major mining groups employed only 23.2 per cent of their complements, with grades falling and costs rising.[19] In consequence, the Chamber of Mines decided to appoint a sub-Committee on Labour to investigate ways in which the supply could be augmented, a move which initiated official consideration of the possibility of importing Chinese labour. At this time Chinese importation was only considered as a last resort.[20] However, between mid-1902 and 1903, the continuation of the pressures on profitability outlined above, and the emergence of new factors, forced the industry into a policy of wholehearted support for immediate Chinese importation.
 Between the appointment of the Chamber’s own sub-Committee on Labour in 1902 and the first meeting of the Transvaal Labour Commission in July 1903, two further influences were brought to bear. First, the stock market boom in gold shares began to evaporate in the wake of increasing evidence of the serious situation in southern Africa. The collapse had very important consequences. At a time when working profits were falling, it added greatly to the pressure on available funds to generate new working capital. As a result, dividends as a proportion of gross yields from mining operations started to fall persistently. On the other hand, the necessity of continuing to distribute dividends to maintain market confidence and hold up share values led to a marked deterioration in the value of ore reserves as mine managers struggled to work the higher grade ore bodies to off-set the poorer returns from un-sorted machine-drilled ore. Faced with this situation, the mines attempted to spread the burden of rising costs over greater reserves, and began, in 1904, to raise their stamping capacity. The result was an accelerated and enforced transition to lower grade mining, accompanied by a marked deterioration in yield and profit because of the companies’ inability to reduce working costs rapidly.[21] Between 1904 and 1910, the average grade of ore mined fell by a further 27 per cent, whilst the net return on capital fell from 8.5 per cent to 2.6 per cent.[22]
 The industry was also forced to support the importation of Chinese labour by developments within the labour market for Portuguese East


-----

##### Africa, hitherto the staple supply of indentured labour for the mines. As in other areas, such as mineral taxation and tariff policy, the British administration of the Transvaal had from an early date recognized the importance of this labour market bv negotiating a modus vivendi with the Portuguese authorities on labour recruiting and railway policy in 1901.[23]
 Despite this formal agreement, labour supplies, here as elsewhere, were subject to fluctuations. In the first two years of resumed operations, the rate of supply was steady and considerable numbers came forward - 38, 631 in 1902 and 43, 625 in 1903. However, towards the end of 1903 indications from recruiters in the field showed that increases of this order could not be sustained, even from the most populous regions. In 1904 these fears were realised when only 27, 633 men were recruited by WNLA south of Lat.22° South.[24] The over-dependence of the industry on this source of indentured labour, which this situation revealed, was readily appreciated by its leaders who saw Chinese labour as a means of avoiding potentially serious embarrassment following restrictive or retaliatory action from the Portuguese authorities.[25]
 The political situation in the Transvaal and Britain also dictated the pattern and pace of events leading up to the introduction of Chinese labour. Thus, the growing body of favourable opinion within the industry was kept largely secret until March 1903 when Sir George Farrar, chairman of the Anglo-French Group of mining companies, opened the public campaign in support of importation.[26] Prior to that, the Chamber’s sub-committee on labour had unanimously recommended in December 1902 that investigations be made into the labour potential of the Far East, a decision which bore fruit in the despatch of H. Ross Skinner and Herbert Noyes to China on a fact-finding mission in February 1903.[27] By the time Skinner and Noyes returned to South Africa in September to report their findings that Chinese labour was an economic possibility for the industry, the government of the Transvaal had also come out publicly in favour of importation. At the same time it had appointed the Transvaal Labour Commission to investigate the causes of the shortage and recommend a solution. With the industry’s virtual monopoly of the media, favourable official opinion and growing depression in the country, the result of the deliberations of the Commission was a foregone conclusion. When its majority report was published in November 1903, its recommendations


-----

##### were taken as thinly veiled support for the Chinese.[28] This was confirmed by a vote in the Chamber of Mines in early December 1903, which requested government sanction to the immediate introduction of an ordinance permitting importation.[29] This was accepted, and at the end of 1903 it introduced a draft measure into the Legislative Council of the Transvaal. This became law in February 1904, subject to the sanction of the Imperial Government. This was given on 11 March 1904.[30] The successful negotiation of an international Convention between Britain and China on behalf of the Transvaal government in May 1904 completed the legal apparatus on which the introduction of Chinese labour was based.[31]
 The historical significance of the introduction of indentured Chinese miners was not confined to southern Africa. The whole episode, from its beginnings in 1902-4, through to the wholesale repatriation of the Chinese work force of 53, 828 men between 1907 and 1910, was also an important chapter in the history of Chinese indentured emigration. The negotiation of the Anglo-Chinese Labour Convention of 1904, and the subsequent recruiting in north and south China between 1904 and 1906, was the first example of Chinese indentured emigration under mutually recognised government regulation. It was also the first example of this type of emigration on any scale and under any form of supervision since the closure of the Macao ‘coolie’ trade in 1874.[32] In its organisational technique and expertise it was clearly distinct from its nineteenth-century predecessors, providing a blue-print for the larger utilisation of Chinese labour by the French and the British Armies in the First World War.[33] Furthermore, in its predominantly northern Chinese focus, the migration to the Transvaal underlined trends in population movements of twentieth-century China, rather than continuing those of the nineteenth century, which had been largely southern in emphasis. Even the correlation of Chinese migration and gold mining was significantly different in this case, for whereas Australian and United States Chinese had gone under varying forms of bondage, they rarely sailed as genuinely indentured emigrants as did the Chinese going to the Rand.[34]
 Some form of state regulation was bound to be imposed upon the Transvaal trade. Ever since 1855, with the enactment of the Chinese Passenger Act, varying degrees of government control had been exercised over Chinese emigration by British authorities. This was in spite of the fact


-----

##### that the 1866 and 1868 regulations to the Convention of Peking of 1860 had been rejected by one party or the other.[35] Nevertheless, in 1889, in the wake of the fast developing steam passenger traffic in the China trade, Hong Kong Ordinance 1 further extended government regulation over British ships conveying Chinese emigrants from Chinese ports, and over all ships conveying Chinese emigrants from Hong Kong. Although this process was less extensive than the legal superstructure which governed Indian indentured emigration to British and other colonies at the time, by the late nineteenth century, the Chinese passenger trade was far from being unregulated.[36]
 The particular pattern of state intervention in the Transvaal trade was determined by a combination of forces emanating from the conditions governing Chinese emigration at the time the Transvaal mine owners sought access to the Chinese labour market, and from considerations acting in the Transvaal and Britain. Briefly, in the Transvaal itself, the conflicts which emerged within the white polity, particularly between the white working class, the white traders and the agricultural interests and the mine owners over labour and possible competition from an influx of Asian traders, was such that the mining industry actively lobbied for state support to control these conflicts. At the same time, the industry appreciated that conflicts between the Chinese workforce and the mine owners themselves also reauired state intervention.[37] In Britain the affront given to humanitarian and non-conformist opinion by the proposal to introduce Chinese into the Transvaal, was matched by the opposition from organised labour. Both of these groups were powerful enough in Parliament to force the British government to impose certain controls upon the conditions of importation and service in the Transvaal.[38] In China, the recognition that some form of emigration to the Transvaal could not, under the terms of the Convention of Peking, be refused, was accompanied by a determination to ensure some form of metropolitan control over western colonial labour practices.[39]
 The result was a complex legal importation structure. Two major pieces of legislation governed the operation of the traffic. The basic legal document was the Anglo-Chinese Labour Convention of May 1904, which was designed to replace the unratified Regulations to the Convention of Peking of 1860. The 1904 Convention laid down the broad conditions of government regulation in respect of recruiting, shipping and conditions of


-----

##### contract of service for British colonies as a whole. This document is of particular interest in that it combined regulations governing the Indian and Chinese emigrant trades to British colonies. This can be most clearly seen in the schedule to the Convention which set out particulars in relation to shipping space and provisions which were directly determined not by the Chinese Passenger Acts, but by the Indian Emigration Acts of 1883 and after.[40]
 Specific sanction to import labour under the terms of the Anglo-Chinese Labour Convention was provided by the Transvaal Labour Importation Ordinance of 1904, together with regulations issued under authority of section 29 of that Ordinance.[41] Generally speaking, the Ordinance and Regulations elaborated six major provisions of the 1904 Convention. These were: the right of a British colony to import labour from China, the obligation to appoint a protector of Chinese labour to oversee conditions of employment (termed the Superintendent of Foreign Labour together with a subordinate Foreign Labour Department [FLD]), the right to free repatriation and the right of free emigration for labourer’s families, prohibition on the speculative transfer of labourers, standardisation of a general form of indenture of service, together with a guaranteed minimum wage, and lastly, the control of conditions of embarkation and shipping. Subsequently these provisions were elaborated further by the issue of Instructions to Transvaal Emigration Agents in China and to the Inspectors of Chinese Labour placed along the Rand.[42]
 The FLD became the means by which all the obligations and functions of the Transvaal and the British governments were coordinated. To effect this role, the FLD combined both inspectoral and executive functions. Thus in the Transvaal, at the mines, and in Natal at the port of Durban, the Department had an inspectoral role. This was changed when a few judicial powers of fining were added to the powers of the mine inspectors under the terms of the Labour Importation Amendment Act of 1905.[43] In China, the FLD had not only an inspectoral role to play over the whole of the embarkation procedure, but also acquired through its Transvaal Emigration Agents, an executive position by virtue of its right to control the receiving depots at the coast ports. This dual position originated in the desire of the Superintendent of the FLD to control the activities of the recruiting agents by limiting access to the recruits on arrival at the port.[44] These different


-----

##### functions of government, described by the mining industry as ‘a confusion of the functions of Government and private enterprise’, were a direct result of obligations undertaken in London and South Africa.[45]
 The consequence of these arrangements was paradoxical. On the one hand, a high degree of state intervention was required to make importation a practical, legal and political possibility. On the other hand, such arrangements also raised the unit cost of importation and employment, and threatened to restrict the usefulness of Chinese labour as a general panacea for the ills of the mining industry. To resolve these contradictions, the mining industry, acting in unison, devised a variety of policies which covered the whole range of cost problems associated with the introduction and utilisation of this type of indentured labour. Recruiting, shipping and employment practices were affected to such an extent that the use of Chinese labour in the Transvaal gold mining industry, albeit for only six years, marked a major development in the history of the use of indentured labour within the British Empire.
 The basis of the mining industry’s control over recruiting and shipping was established at an early stage. Thus, from October 1903, finance and control of the operation in China was in the hands of a Committee of Agents representing the whole of the mining industry of the Transvaal.[46]
 Subsequently, when introduction had been guaranteed by state intervention this committee was dissolved and replaced by a more permanent organisation known as the Chamber of Mines Labour Importation Agency
 [CMLIA]. This was a non-profit-making limited company registered in the Transvaal on 15 July 1904.[47] This agency was closely modelled on WNLA, with which it ultimately merged during the repatriation of the labourers in 1908.[48] Through this institution, the cost constraints of Rand gold mining were brought to bear directly upon the recruiting and shipping arrangements.
 Control over these central aspects of the importation procedure was achieved in two ways. First, the CMLIA acted as sole importer for the industry, thereby conferring the advantages of a highly capitalised, non- competitive buyer upon the individual mining companies who contracted with the Agency. Second, the vertical integration of managerial power within the company, ensured rapid and effective response to initiatives undertaken by the industry at any point in the importation procedure. These aspects of the CMLIA rationalised investment, reduced risk and unit cost,


-----

##### and at the same time ensured access to state power and the widest possible exploitation of the Chinese labour market. This latter feature ensured the maximising of the potential labour supply at the same time as it insured the industry against the possibility of recruiting failures in any one part of the country.[49]
 It is important to appreciate that the CMLIA was not a recruiting or shipping company in the strict sense of these terms, for in both aspects of the importation process, it acted as a contractor or middle-man for the individual companies. Thus, in south China where the experiment began in February 1904, the agency contracted with the British firm of Butterfield and Swire at Hong Kong to provide them with recruits, ships and provisions for the trip to Durban. Swire’s agency was deemed to include all of south- eastern China as far north as the treaty port of Swatow. The central provinces were divided for recruiting purposes between Jardine, Matheson & Co., and Gibb, Livingstone & Co. For the northern provinces, four firms were chosen, two based on the Shantung port of Chefoo, two based on the Chihli port of Tientsin. At Chefoo, the agency was divided between Cornabe, Eckford & Co. and Silas Schwabe & Co., and at Tientsin between William Forbes & Co. and the Chinese Engineering and Mining Co. Ltd. Like the recruiting contracts, shipping arrangements were initially made with western firms: Butterfield and Swire at Hong Kong in the south, and Livingston, Halton & Co., chartering brokers, in the north.[50] Throughout the period of active recruiting from February 1904 to November 1906, therefore, the South African experiment relied upon the apparatus of the Treaty Port system for the exploitation of Chinese labour resources.[51]
 By and large, despite this welter of contractual relations, the CMLIA was able to dictate successfully the pattern and pace of recruiting and shipping. Thus, between February 1904 and January 1907, 63, 695 Chinese labourers were landed in South Africa. The shipments were distributed effectively to meet peak demand from the mining companies. Despite an annual loss of labour power through death disease and repatriation, varying between 6.6 per cent in 1905 and 15.5 per cent in 1907 of those employed, the number landed represented an effective addition of 53, 828 men to the unskilled labour force of the Transvaal mines at the height of the experiment in January 1907.[52] Between 1906 and 1907, Chinese labourers represented


-----

##### over 35 per cent of the total unskilled work force on the mines, the largest single group of indentured labourers at that time.[53]
 The great majority of these men were recruited from the northern provinces of Shantung and Chihli. No less than 62, 006, or 97.3 per cent of the men embarked for the Transvaal mines came from the northern ports and of these approximately 93 per cent were from these two most northerly provinces.[54] Such a pattern of recruiting was not anticipated at the beginning of importation. It had originally been the industry’s intention to exploit the more familiar emigration grounds of Kuantung, Kuangsi and Furhien provinces, prior to establishing recruiting contacts in the north. However, the failure of the southern recruiting drive as a result of the opposition of local vested interests working for the Malaysian emigrant trade and the poor quality of recruits secured from the south, meant that after November 1904 all of the industry’s attention was focused on Shantung and Chihli.[55] The wisdom and efficacy of exploiting the maximum area of the labour market was thereby strongly emphasised, for despite initial difficulties, recruits were drawn in from a wide area of the interior of these two most populous provinces of the north China plain. The essential reason for the success of the CMLIA in the north must be sought in its appreciation of the market opportunities provided by the closure of Manchurian emigration as a result of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5. This removed the largest source of competitive demand for labour and enabled the CMLIA to tap an already established migratory movement.[56]
 Large scale recruiting in the northern provinces initiated by the CMLIA was matched by large scale shipment and embarkation. From the outset, in June 1904, embarkation from the north was concentrated on the port of Taku [Tientsin] but was transferred north to Chinwangtao in August 1904. This was a much safer anchorage, facilitated the free use of large steamers, provided better and cheaper accommodation facilities for the intending recruits, and was further away from the depredations of rival recruiters. Embarkation from Shantung did not begin until November 1904, when Chefoo became a regular port of call for South Africa bound steamers.[57]
 In the provision of transport, the CMLIA was materially aided by the impact of steam technology upon the passenger trade of the Far East. Its application to South African importation ensured that a large scale cost effective arrangement could be extended from the interior through to the


-----

##### landing of recruits in Durban. Steamers materially enlarged the range of passenger voyages, whilst simultaneously increasing the speed at which these be undertaken. This was a major consideration, particularly when recruiting centred upon the northern provinces, as this added an additional five days to the thirty day trip from Hong Kong to Durban. Further, the considerably increased capacity which steam shipping permitted, reduced unit costs without increasing risk or loss through wastage. The thirty-two voyages from north China ports undertaken between June 1904 and November 1906 had an average passenger complement of 1, 945, and an average death rate of 0.004 per 1, 000 embarked. The introduction of steam shipping also greatly increased the rate of turnover of shipping on the voyage. This kept the need for a large number of ships on charter to a minimum. This can be seen most clearly in the shipping arrangements for 1906 when the last two voyages to South Africa from China were made by the same ship - the S.S. Cranley. Indeed, this vessel succeeded in making no less than four round trips from China to South Africa in 1906, a feat which would have been impossible in the days of sail. The CMLIA was also aided in the conduct of this extensive operation by developments in telegraphic communication. Rapid control over the finer details of the shipping and recruiting of labourers was made possible by telegraphic communication within the CMLIA and between the FLD in Johannesburg and its Transvaal Emigration Agents.[58]
 The CMLIA adopted policies at the embarkation ports, on board ship, and at the port of arrival in Natal designed to capitalise upon this situation. These policies essentially involved the employment of strict medical criteria to weed out recruits considered unsuitable for mining work by doctors employed by the CMLIA and the subsequent imposition of a strict code of discipline to maintain an acceptable level of public health on board ship and in the depots. This policy was backed up by the introduction of internal policing methods imposed by the companies not only to reinforce the medical regime but also to accustom the workforce to the social control mechanisms operative on the mines. This force of ‘Chinese Police’ was chosen from amongst the recruits at the port of embarkation and placed under the control of a European overseer on board ship. Subject to satisfactory conduct on the voyage, these police would be confirmed in their position on the mines, whilst in many cases the overseers would take up the position of Compound Manager at the mine.[59]

##### Up to the point of transfer of the imported labourers from the CMLIA to the individual mining companies the industry had been involved in substantial outlays of money to secure a labour force of sufficient size and quality at the right price. Thus, whilst an average of £17/5/2 per head was expanded as non-recoverable costs of importation, these were in addition to the cost of share allocations in the Agency and the capital costs involved in the alteration of compound buildings to meet the standards laid down by the government.[60] To deal with this situation, certain very clear patterns of employment were devised by the mining industry, with the result that Chinese labour differed in some important respects from other forms of indentured labour employed in the mines at this period.
 The most notable difference between Chinese and African unskilled labour was the greatly increased period of service. A minimum time of three years was laid down in the Chinese indenture, with an option to renew for further periods not to exceed five years in total. This initial period of service was considered the minimum period within which the mining companies could recover their outlay on importation costs, taking into account the ‘wastage’ of labourers resulting from deaths, injuries, desertion or repatriations.[61] Two additional advantages were also specified in the Chinese contract of service which gave the mines the advantages they sought to reverse the crisis in accumulation. First, the contract of service stipulated that the Chinese could only be employed in metalliferous mining. Second, that such employment had to be within the Witwatersrand district.[62] This meant in effect that the labour of the Chinese work force was exclusively at the disposal of the gold mining industry for the full period of its employment. Competition for Chinese labour within the Transvaal, either from any other type of mining outside the Witwatersrand, or from any other type of business anywhere in the Transvaal, was illegal. In the absence of competition amongst this restricted group of employers, an unlikely threat in view of the arrangements entered into, the gold mining industry was able to determine the allocation of labour in a manner best suited to its requirements.
 The industry sought to exploit the advantages that it derived from this captive labour force also in the arrangements that it made for the distribution of importees as they arrived from China. To meet the demand, the CMLIA allocated the complements of African and Chinese labour separately, on a pro rata basis to match the complements of the individual


-----

##### mines controlled by particular Groups. Initially, it distributed approximately 2, 200 Chinese labourers to each Group and then, after some readjustment, distributed the Chinese to Groups having the least percentage of their shareholding in the CMLIA represented by Chinese labourers. On this basis, two batches of 500 labourers from the same ship were allocated to a Group should its percentage, after taking into account its first 500, be lower than another Group which was an applicant for Chinese at the same time.[63]
 There were two important consequences of these arrangements which tended to increase the division amongst the mining houses into richer and poorer Groups. First, it tended to limit the extent to which Groups not able to afford Chinese labour could expect to benefit directly from the aggregate increase in the labour supply which resulted from importation, as distribution of African labour was not based on the number of Chinese held by a particular group. Second, this distribution deliberately favoured the richer and more powerful Groups by allocating Chinese labour on the basis of their differential subscription of capital to the CMLIA.
 Within this differential commitment to Chinese labour, the clear demarcation between it and other groups of unskilled labour was extended by a greater than average distribution of Chinese to the producing mines of all Groups. This was a deliberate policy, for unlike the rules governing the distribution of labour in WNLA, there was no obligation to give stamping mines priority in the allocation of labour under the CMLIA’s rules on distribution.[64] This policy was extended by a greater than average distribution of Chinese miners on underground work in the producing mines in which they were engaged.[65] One reason for this was that despite an original intention to the contrary, there was no policy to differentiate between so-called Chinese and African mines.[66] What this meant in practice was that batches of Chinese imported by a particular company were supplemented by groups of African largely for surface work. The varying numbers depended on the mine complement and the availability of African and Chinese labour at the time. The idea of segregation was abandoned because the large number of Chinese introduced made it impossible to keep labourers apart indefinitely. Furthermore, there were strong financial grounds for integration. Apart from the obvious disadvantages of reorganisation resulting from a mine being stripped of its work force to make way for another, many mines were not, especially at first, in a position ‘to spend enormous sums of money obtaining full complements of


-----

##### coolies’.[67] As a result, only three out of a total of fifty-four companies employed Chinese labour exclusively in all six years of the use of this type of labour.[68]
 To reinforce this pattern of labour distribution, the Groups tended to encourage a distinct move towards concentration in occupational areas in particular types of mines where recuperation of importation costs was likely to be most rapid and where Chinese labour was most useful in reducing working costs and raising output through increased efficiency. A logical extension of this policy was to employ a very high proportion of Chinese miners in the strategically most productive jobs. Of these undoubtedly the most important was that of hand drilling in the stopes. No less than 65-75 per cent of all Chinese employed on the Rand were used in this way.[69] To effect this, widespread use of piece work payment was introduced. Productivity related payments were undoubtedly much more widespread for Chinese than African labour at the time, and were introduced not only because of the necessity of keeping costs to a minimum and recuperating high importation charges, but also by the provisions of Clause 6 of the contract which stipulated a minimum rate for day’s pay after a six month period. As these conditions did not apply to piece work, the industry had a double incentive to introduce the practice of labour.[70]
 The timing of the introduction of piece-work contracts was determined by the realisation that Clause 6 had put strong bargaining power into the hands of the Chinese work force. Following a major confrontation between the mine management and the CMLIA at the North Randfontein gold mine in April 1905, it became imperative for the management to introduce a system of payment which removed the necessity of extracting surplus through a hierarchy of unreliable intermediaries, and simultaneously ensured a retention of management control over productivity and wage rates.[71] As early as January 1905 the Committee of Consulting Engineers had drawn up a list of piece work rates applicable to nearly 80 per cent of Chinese occupations. As the Chinese moved out of their initial periods of employment, more and more of these types of agreements were engaged on the Rand after April 1905.[72]
 These measures had a two-fold effect. First, they were largely successful in containing the wage costs of Chinese labour whilst rapidly increasing output. Between 1904 and 1910, mining expenses increased by 99.7 per


-----

##### cent, and revenue by 99.03 per cent. As a proportion of these gross expenses, aggregate Chinese wages represented an average of 4.27 per cent of the total every year between 1904 and 1909.[73] At the same time, the effect of these productivity-related payments on industrial relations was particularly bad. Piece work became a major source of grievance for the Chinese work force, as the mine managements made persistent attempts to extract greater and greater benefits from the terms of the contracts. In one notorious case, at the Cason gold mine on the East Rand in 1907, a dispute over the interpretation of a piece work contract ended in loss of life and serious damage to property.[74] Although the mining industry was able to overcome the disruptive effects of these disputes by increased collaboration with the state, the political impact of worsening relations between the Chinese and their employers was detrimental to the long-term future of importation.[75]
 Despite this temporary worsening of relations between Chinese labour and the mine managements, importation soon had a material impact on the crisis in the mining industry. Thus, Chinese labour made a major contribution to the absolute growth of the labour force. This was particularly rapid in the period of bulk importation between June 1904 and February 1905, but continued throughout the period of importation down to January 1907. During the whole period of importation, the unskilled labour force as a whole increased from 69, 336 to 135, 059.[76] Much of this change was directly attributable to the Chinese as can be seen by the fact that at one point, in July 1906, Chinese labour represented 40.22 per cent of labour at work, the largest single group of workers in the mines. Concurrently the gathering recession in the Transvaal initiated a parallel process in the numbers of African miners at work.[77]
 At the same time Chinese importation tended to reduce substantially the impact of fluctuations in the supply of African labour, and had a marked effect upon the rate of labour turnover.[78] Thus, in the two years 1904-6, the turnover rate of the whole unskilled labour force fell by 61.8 per cent, of which only 5 per cent was attributable to increases in the length of service of African miners.[79] Even more significant, this increasingly favourable position was achieved at a time of stabilising wage costs for African labour. Although Chinese importation did not succeed in reversing the upward trend in African wage rates until 1906-7, it certainly slowed the rate of


-----

##### increase dramatically after the very steep rises of 1901-4.[80] At the same time, Chinese labour also obviated the necessity of finding any alternative source of unskilled labour, particularly more expensive white unskilled labour, and moved the all-important ratio of white to coloured labour sharply in favour of cheaper coloured labour.[81] Chinese importation also effectively eliminated the more expensive and marginal sources of African labour, such as Central Africa and German South West Africa.[82]
 Chinese labour also made a major contribution to the long-term structural transformation of the gold mining industry. This involved an increased rate of production and the maintenance of a differential capital composition in the production process at a time of increased scale of operations. The ability of the mining industry to employ large numbers of Chinese miners on the productively strategic tasks of hand rock drilling extended the stoping area available to individual mines, whilst narrowing the size of individual stopes worked. By increasing the output of cleaner ore, this process controlled the lowering of the grade of ore mined. At the same time, by allowing for more hand drilling and sorting, the reduced volume of waste in the ore lowered working costs to compensate for the lower grade rock. Costs were also lowered by more selective use of rock drills, facilitating the replacement of expensive white machine-drill operators from areas where hand drilling was more practical and economic, and by increasing capital investment in surface operations.[83]
 Yet it would be wrong to stress the role of the Chinese in reversing the post-war crisis in the mining industry to the exclusion of other factors for the simple reason that the full potential of this labour was never allowed to develop. From mid-1907 the wholesale repatriation of the Chinese labour force began under the terms of the Indentured Labour Laws (Temporary Continuance) Act of the new Transvaal Parliament. This law, which effectively terminated the importation of Chinese labour and ensured its eventual demise as a part of the unskilled labour complement of the mining industry was the culmination of a crisis which began in December 1905. In that month, the fall of Balfour’s Conservative and Unionist Government resulted in the advent of a Liberal administration under Campbell- Bannerman committed to immediate cessation of importation and wholesale repatriation of the Chinese work force. Despite promises made during their victorious electoral campaign in January 1906, the Liberal government was not able to force the issue on either repatriation or importation. The


-----

##### potential cost of annulling the validity of outstanding importation licenses to which Transvaal government approval had been given, forced the administration to permit the continuation of importation and recruitment until 30 November 1906. As a result, a large proportion of the importation licenses issued were taken up by the mining industry. At the same time, the disruptive effects of immediate repatriation also persuaded the Liberal government to draw back from this proposal. Instead, it permitted the honouring of existing arrangements pending the grant of Responsible Government under terms of new Letters Patent which effectively provided for the termination of the system of Chinese indentured labour.[84]
 Under terms of Article L(I) of the new Transvaal Constitution, the right of renewal of the contract of service was withdrawn. Under Article L(2) it was provided that within one year of the meeting of the Transvaal Legislature that the Importation Ordinance and all amending Ordinances Rules and Regulations would cease to have legality within the Colony. This proposal, by threatening to turn the Chinese into free labourers, ensured that Chinese labour would be the main issue of the forthcoming election. The victory of Botha’s Het Volk party committed to Chinese repatriation did not result, however, in a continuation of the Liberal government’s entire programme. The new Transvaal government responded to representations from the mining industry that to repatriate the Chinese without time being given to find adequate substitutes would be ‘a recipe for chaos’.[85]
 Consequently, the Het Volk government passed the Indentured Labour Laws (Temporary Continuance) Act to suspend the operation of Article L(2) of the Letters Patent, whilst confirming Article L(1). As a result, Chinese repatriation began as contracts expired in the second half of 1907 and continued until February 1910, when the last shipment of time-expired labourers left Durban for China.[86]
 Between 1907 and 1910, the mining industry was able to make an effective and long lasting return to reliance on African unskilled labour. Nevertheless the pattern of utilisation was different. Prior to the introduction of the Chinese there had been marked dependence upon indentured labour from Portuguese East Africa. After 1907, the proportion of African labour on shorter contracts drawn from within the British South African High Commission territories showed a substantial and continuing rise. This change was made in the context of a significantly enlarged work force. Central to an understanding of this process is an appreciation of the


-----

##### importance of the Transvaal government’s establishment of the Native Labour Bureau in 1907. This institution was set up to aid the mining industry’s transfer back to African labour by facilitating the flow of labour from the Cape Colony, Natal and Zululand. As a result of the Bureau’s activities, there was an 87.2 per cent increase in African labour at work in the mines from the Cape and a 54.5 per cent increase from Natal and Zululand in the period December 1906-1908.[87] The explanation for this development must be sought in the underlying economic situation. By 1907, the country had been in the grip of an economic recession for close on four years. The severity of the downturn was such that as early as 1905 it had made a noticeable impact on the industry’s available African labour supply. At that time the continuation of the Chinese supply had led to the rejection of surplus African labour. The continuation of this situation, poor harvests, and related structural changes in many African communities had turned the situation decisively in the industry’s favour by the time that repatriation became a reality. Thus, at the height of the Chinese exodus in March 1908, the Chamber of Mines was able to report that the unskilled labour position ‘is on a very satisfactory footing at the present.’[88]
 Even as this shift in the pattern of African labour was establishing itself, the traditional predominance of the southern districts of Portuguese East Africa was itself under challenge as the industry began large scale recruiting in the tropical areas of the territory, and in the neighbouring British Central African Protectorate.[89] This drive into the tropical territories, with a consequent rapid rise in the death rate of African miners employed, was to be one of the bitterest legacies of this controversial period in the history of the Transvaal gold mining industry.[90]
