## Structural Transformation and the Demand  for New Labor  in  Advanced Economies:  Interwar Britain

CAROL  E. HEIM

In  prosperous  and  depressed  areas  sectors  of  industry  representing  structural transformation  in  interwar  Britain  tended  to  draw  upon  new  types  of  workers rather than upon workers displaced in declining export industries. Data on the age and  sex  composition  of  people  in  expanding  and  declining  industries,  on  new entrants to the labor force, and on interindustry mobility are examined to support this claim. The process reflects a general tendency of capitalist economies to grow through incorporation  of new elements.

D URING periods of structural transformation  involving the rise and decline  of industries,  or technological  and organizational  changes within industries, capitalist economies tend to draw fresh  elements into production.  They  create  new productive  structures  rather  than  reallocating  to new uses  the labor,  capital,  land,  or other  elements  already within the sphere  of capitalist  relationships,  particularly  those  already within industrial production. The view of the economy as a mechanism for allocating  a  given  or  smoothly  increasing  pool  of  resources  is especially  inappropriate  for these  periods; it does  not make central to growth the incorporation of new elements and ejection of old ones. The phenomenon has appeared historically in many forms, from the bypass of  handloom  weavers  in constituting  the labor  forces  of early  textile factories, to  the  current migration  of  assembly processes to  less developed  countries.

The  process  bears  some  similarity  to that  of  "primitive  accumulation" in early stages of development, when accumulation necessarily is based  on  incorporating  previously  noncapitalist  elements.  Later  the capitalist  economy  becomes  increasingly  self-reproducing,  generating within itself the requirements for continued accumulation.  But incorporation  of  new  elements  continues,  and  continues within advanced economies,  unless  modified  by state  policy  or  trade  union  action  to

ensure reallocation. New labor for electronics assembly, for example, is sought  in  the  Far  East  and  Latin  America  but  is also  drawn  from  the spheres  of  agriculture  and  the  household  (female  and juvenile  labor) within developed  West  European  economies.

New  elements  are  sought  for  two  reasons.  First,  they  often are cheaper; fresh labor will expect lower wages than experienced industrial workers. This is relevant  primarily for  unskilled  and  semiskilled  workers; for  skilled  tasks  new  workers  will not  be preferred.  Perhaps  even more important  than  direct  labor  costs,  however,  is  adaptability-the ability  and  willingness  of  elements  in  the  production  process  to  be structured  by capital in accordance with the aim of expansion of value. As new industries expand, and especially as old industries change, firms seek  elements  that  are  relatively  unhampered  by  existing  productive structures  or  existing  ideas  about  the  production  process.  The  more  a process  has  a  craft character,  the  less  likely  are  its  workers  to  be incorporated  into a new one.

Following the collapse of the nineteenth-century export trades, structural  transformation  in  interwar  Britain  happened  in  two  ways. First,  it  entailed  changes  in  industrial  composition,  the  growth  of  a range of manufacturing  industries  and  services  oriented  more  towards the home market and associated with changing patterns of consumption. Second, changes in production methods within expanding and declining industries  created  new jobs  for  unskilled  or semiskilled  rather than  for skilled labor. In "new" manufacturing industries and in the diverse light industries  that  were  important  to  Britain's  interwar  growth,  massproduction methods increasingly were introduced. When these structural  transformations  occurred  they  tended  to  draw  on  sources  of  labor other than displaced  workers from  the declining  industries.

## THE  DEMAND  FOR  NEW  LABOR  IN  INTERWAR  BRITAIN

Expanding  industries  included  the  "new"  manufacturing  industries (motor cars, electrical goods, rayon, scientific equipment, rubber, some branches  of  chemicals);  diverse  light  industries  (miscellaneous  metal goods,  furniture, clothing,  food,  cardboard  boxes,  and  others);  and services and  building. Declining  industries  were  a  much narrower group: primarily coal,  shipbuilding, iron and steel products, and  cotton textiles.  Except  in  textiles  the  displaced  workers  were  predominantly male, often  craft  workers, with union experience-not the type of labor sought in many expanding industries, especially those reflecting genuine structural  transformation.

Table  1  lists industries that expanded and declined during  1923-1937, and  proportions  of  males  and  females  aged  14-15  and  16-64  in  1936. Many  expanding  industries,  especially diverse light industries and

services, had  low shares  of adult  males; this  would  be even more  true were  it  possible  to  break  the  figures  at  18-64  rather  than  at  16-64. Declining industries (except textiles) had very high proportions of adult males. The relative importance of various industries in the total increase in  insured  persons,  1923-1937,  is  indicated  by  the  figures  in  the  first column. The data on insured  persons,  rather  than on employment,  are used because they allow detailed breakdown by industry, sex, and age. 1

Average weekly  earnings of females  and juveniles  tended  to be onethird to one-half those of adult males; their lower average weekly hours do  not  fully account  for  the  differential. Earnings  for agricultural workers  also  were  well  below those  for industrial male  workers. Industry spokesmen were explicit about their preference for fresh  labor for less skilled tasks. The Federation of British Industries in 1938 listed second under factors influencing location "presence of skilled labour or spare  labour  at  an  economic  price,"  and  explained  that  "we  want  to draw  a  distinction  between  labour  which  has  already  been  employed and  labour  which  is  spare  and  has  never  been  employed  at  all."   The 2 impulse was particularly strong in cases of change in existing industries. In  1939 the Treasury  considered  funding  a boot and shoe factory  to be operated  by a German-Jewish immigrant on the "Ford"  system involving conveyors and simplification of tasks. The applicant, who claimed to have applied the system throughout  his factories  in Germany,  believed

that  it  is  not  possible  successfully  to  apply  this  system  to  existing factories,  but  that  to realise  the  fullest economies  a  new  factory starting  from scratch  is  needed.  . . . he prefers  to work  with  unskilled  labour  rather  than  with  labour  which  has had  experience of  the  boot  trade,  since  in  the  latter  case  the  operatives  have  much  to  unlearn before they  can  successfully  apply  his  methods. 3

Similarly, when John Barran &amp; Sons, one of the nation's largest clothing manufacturers,  decided  to  introduce  a  conveyor  system  in  1937, they did  so  in  their  new  branch  factory  at  the  North  East  Trading  Estate rather  than  in their  Leeds  works.

Even  within  "new"  industries  that  employed  a  high  proportion  of males  there  is  evidence  that  agricultural  and  young  workers  were preferred  over  industrial  migrants,  particularly  Welsh  miners.  According to Whiting's  work  on Oxford,  home of Morris Motors and  Pressed Steel, the local motor car industry drew the majority of its recruits in the

interwar  period  from  the immediate  area,  from  largely  nonindustrial occupations, though  it  also attracted a  smaller number  from  the depressed areas  of  the  North and  West. "Local employers  were certainly  keen  to  employ  farm  workers;  according  to  a  Ministry  of Agriculture inspector  'a very definite  preference  exists among contractors and others for local workers off farms rather than for travellers from

a distance'."  Whiting attributes Pressed Steel's more troubled industri4 al  relations  partly  to the firm's  coming  to Oxford  after  Morris  Motors and  having to draw  more  heavily on industrial  migrants. Coventry  also drew workers from  rural  areas, and had a strong demand for boys for semiskilled  work.  Employers were eager to tap the depressed  areas for this  type  of labor  and eventually  enlisted  the help  of the Director of Education in bringing boys to Coventry.  Note also in Table  1  the high 5 proportions of boys in the electrical and scientific equipment industries.

Evidence  that  sectors  of structural  transformation  sought new labor also  can  be  gleaned  from  data  on  new  entrants  to  unemployment insurance.  The prosperous  London  and South  Eastern  divisions contained a disproportionate  share (32 percent) of all new entrants in Great Britain during 1931-1939; the share of London and the South East in the total  insured  population  aged  16-64 was only  25 percent  in  1923  (27 percent by 1932).  Makower, Marschak, and Robinson compiled  figures 6 to test the notion that redistribution of labor among industries  occurred primarily  through  the  recruitment  of  children  leaving  school.  Their figures,  covering  1927-1931 for males only, indicate  that

the  number of new entrants aged  16-18 annually  exceeds the total readjustment  in the industry. Thus the adults not only failed  to transfer  themselves in sufficient  numbers to contribute towards the increase in the size of the growing industries; they failed even to move  in  suflficient  numbers  to  compensate  for  the  loss  of workers  due  to  deaths  and retirements. 7

Adult new entrants,  however,  were  also  significant,  particularly  in the South.  The insured  population  in London  and the South  East  rose by 21.4  percent  over  1922-1931, whereas  the total  population  there  only increased by 9.2 percent over 1921-1931. Only about half the increase in total population  can  be  attributed to  migration  from other  areas. 8 Figures  in Table  2 for  1923-1924 to  1939 show  that  the proportion of adult to juvenile  new entrants, especially for women, was higher in the growing  southern  areas  than elsewhere. A study commissioned  by the Board of Trade  suggested  that

it appears likely, therefore, that the labour required for the rapid industrial expansion in the  South  has  been  met,  partly  by  an  increase  in  population  made  more  rapid  by  an inward migration from  other parts of the country, partly by the drawing into industrial

Note:  For  1923-1924 through  1930-1931,  "Boys" and  "Girls" are stated to refer to persons  aged 16-18,  and  "Men"  and  "Women"  to  persons  above  18 years.  For the  data  taken  directly from  the Ministry of  Labour  Gazette for  1931  through  1939,  "Boys"  and  "Girls"  refer  to persons aged  16 and  17 through  1934 ; to persons aged  14-17 from  1934  through  1939; and b C "Men"  and  "Women"  refer  to  persons  aged  18-64  throughout.  Figures  from  1931  are calculated  for  January-December  since  the Industrial Survey  of  the  Lancashire Area does not  indicate  at  which  months  its  annual  periods  begin  and  end.  Figures  from  1934 are  not strictly  comparable  with  earlier  years.  From  3  September  1934, juveniles  aged  14 and  15 became  insurable.  The  1934  figures  exclude  those  boys and girls in insurable  employment b who were  15 at or after 3 September but reached the age of  16 before  the end of the  month; these boys and girls are included among the new entrants under 16 years in the  1934  figures. C The  1934  figures include all persons under  16 registered between September and December, C 1934; some of these, of course, had been employed previously. Other relevant changes in the insurance system include its extension in May  1936 to agricultural workers; in February  1937 to  private gardeners; and in April  1938 to domestic  servants and chauffeurs.  These  changes appear to mean that a person moving from agriculture or domestic service to another insured occupation  would  no  longer  be counted  as a  "new  entrant  to  insurance."

life,  perhaps especially in the case of women, of many who were either in agriculture or domestic service, the two great uninsured occupations, or who were not accustomed to take  work  outside  the  home. 9

During the interwar period the overall female activity rate did not rise dramatically (as it did after World War II), nor did the female share of all insured  persons.  But  the  small  increase  partially  conceals  a  compositional effect:  women were sought for new jobs, especially in the South, but at the  same time women were leaving the insured labor force in the textile areas  of  the  Northwest.  Especially  with  the  passage  of  the Anomalies  Regulations  in  1931  tightening  conditions  for  receipt  of unemployment  benefit,  it  appears  that,  to  a greater  degree  than  men, women left  the labor force  when their jobs  disappeared.

Limited  data  on  interindustry  mobility  indicate  that  major  declining industries, except shipbuilding and  engineering,  had  relatively low shares  of  all  outward  transfers  from  one  insured  activity  to  another. 10 The figures for shipbuilding and engineering may reflect greater mobility for  certain  skilled  workers.  Even for  females,  cotton  manufacture  had relatively few transfers:  as in the case of coal mining for men, the share of cotton in total transfers  outward from  all industries was only  one-fifth the share of cotton in the total insured female population. This is partly attributable  to  the  low  degree of geographical  mobility  of females.  For males, the majority of transfers were  between  cognate  industries. Industries  with  high  proportions  of  unskilled  workers  (such  as  public works  contracting;  railway  service  [nonpermanent  workers]; and  gas, water,  and  electricity  supply)  had  comparatively  high  proportions  of transferees in. (A  bias  exists  in  the  data  because  workers briefly employed  on  public  works  projects thenceforth were  classified as having transferred.)  In the more detailed data on coal miners a particularly  interesting  comparison  is the total  number of transfers  out  during 1926-1927 to  1936-1937 (307,572) as  against  "other  causes  for  losses" of  insured  persons from  the industry  (at least 433,653); this gives  some indication  of  the  extent  to  which  changes  in  the  insured  labor  force rather  than  reallocations  to  other  industries  were  responsible  for  the diminishing  number  of persons attached  to the coal  mining  industry.

## EMPLOYMENT OF  NEW  LABOR WITHIN  THE  DEPRESSED AREAS

Even  when  expanding  industries  did  locate  in  the  older  industrial areas  (partly  as  a  result  of  government  policy)  new  sources  of  labor

often  were  drawn  on  rather  than  the  unemployed.  In  the  late  1930s, trading estates  and  special  finance  organizations  set up by the  government, the Bank of England, and  the Nuffield  Trust assisted  businesses in the depressed areas. The evidence shows that the adult male share in employment in assisted firms was much lower than the national average of 64 percent  for  men  18 and  over.  For  the  various  trading  estates  the estimates  range  from  24 to  49 percent  for  men  18 and  over,  with  one figure  of  22  percent  for  men  over  21.  Incomplete  figures  for  firms assisted by the Nuffield  Trust show a higher proportion of males than in other  assisted  firms,  but  the  Trust  also  funded  more firms in  declining industries  such  as  coal  mining  to  preserve  employment  than  did  the other  organizations. 11

In the interwar labor market particular jobs appear to have called  for particular types of labor, with very little substitution. In June  1939 some difficulties  in obtaining an adequate  supply of female  and juvenile  labor in  West  Cumberland  had  been  reported  by  assisted  firms,  especially Kangol Wear, who were disturbed by the number of firms settling in the area.  A  note  circulated  at  the  request  of  the  Commissioner  for  the Special  Areas  argued  that  the  supply  would  be  adequate,  especially  if potential  new  entrants  were  taken  into  account,  and  that Kangol's problem  stemmed  from  their  low  wages.  There  is  no  reference in discussions of the problem, however, to the area's pool of unemployed male labor,  nor  any  suggestion  that  it  might  be used  for  this  purpose. Polikoff  (Wales)  Ltd.,  a  large  clothing  firm  assisted  in  the  Rhondda Valley,  did  indicate  its  willingness  to  substitute  one  type  of  labor  for another,  but  only  male  for  female  juveniles,  partly  in  the  belief  that better  local  employment  opportunities  for  males  might  help  to  ensure the  supply  of females,  who  were  tending  to  seek  employment  outside Wales. 12 Inquiries  to  local  development boards  and  trading estate companies were quite  specific  about  types of labor.  Available  pools of unorganized female and  juvenile labor, actual or potential, were stressed  in local promotional  literature.

In  firms  assisted  by  interwar  regional  policy  measures,  then,  the pattern of  employment  did  not  depart  significantly from prevailing trends; if anything, the patterns  were accentuated.  The attitude  toward female and juvenile employment in the depressed areas was ambivalent. There  were  public  complaints  that  male unemployment  was  not  being addressed;  yet female  employment  was  looked  upon  favorably  as  one

aspect  of  "balance"  in  an  industrial  community.  Moreover,  except  in textile areas, female  employment could not threaten the labor supply to the  established  industries  that  employed  men.  But  even  in  Lancashire textile areas there is some evidence that expanding industries  preferred new  workers  (or  sometimes  the  best  workers,  often  young,  still  employed  in  the  declining  industries).  In  the  north  Lancashire  weaving town of Burnley, for example, the Burnley Council embarked on a New Industries  Program  whose  primary  impact  ultimately  was  on juvenile unemployment, which fell to southern levels in the late 1930s. The local expanding  industries

took  on young people  partly  because they were easy  to train, and partly because  they could pay them low wages.  . . . There were two consequences to this: unemployment in the older age groups was not greatly reduced, and the result was that in many families, the young employed were supporting the old unemployed, a miserable situation for both groups. 13

## CONCLUSION

During  the  interwar  period,  then,  the  British  economy  began  to undergo structural  changes that were essential to its continued  growth, but  that entailed changes  in  the  demand  for  labor.  The structural changes  involved  the  growing  importance  in  the  national  economy  of home  market  industries  and  services,  many  of  which  employed  high proportions  of  young  persons  and  women,  and  movement  into  more mass-production methods  in  both  older  and "new" manufacturing industries,  which  called  for  adaptable,  unskilled  or  semiskilled  labor rather than the labor displaced in the declining export industries. Labor was  sought  from  various  spheres  outside  the  existing  industrial  structures of  British  capitalism-from  agriculture,  from  the household,  and from  uninsured  occupations  such  as  domestic  service.  Interindustry transfers  into  the  industries  reflecting  structural  transformation were limited for  many  categories  of displaced  workers.

Understanding this process is important for three reasons. First, it is a central  and  continuing  characteristic  of  capitalist  development,  which from  its  inception  has  created  new  productive  structures  through  the incorporation  of new elements, not merely through  a rearrangement  of existing elements. Second, the process bears some responsibility for the severity  of the  interwar  unemployment  problem  in Britain. More rapid expansion  of aggregate  demand  would  have helped  many of the unemployed  in  the  short  run  only  to  the  extent  that  it  revived  the  older industries (as, in fact,  rearmament did), rather than through acceleration

of  structural  changes.  Moreover,  greater  geographic  mobility  of  the displaced,  particularly  males,  would  not  necessarily  have  resulted  in their finding  employment. Third, the process contributes  to patterns of uneven regional development because new labor frequently  is sought in new locations. Although other more important factors were operative as well,  there  is  evidence that the  desire  to  avoid  areas  with strong traditions  of  union  organization  contributed  to  the  concentration  of expanding industries  in the  South  of  Britain. l4
