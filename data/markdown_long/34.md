###### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We, the authors, are greatly indebted to all those in the shipping industry who,
over the years, have collectively helped to shape our understanding of the
circumstances of the global seafarer. There are too many people involved for
each to be named and thanked individually, and in any case it is impossible to
determine each person's contribution: on occasions, even a few sharp
observations from a passing acquaintance has proved to be enlightening.
Nevertheless, we would like to express our thanks to the several hundred
seafarers of various ranks and nationalities who so willingly and openly talked
to us about their lives and experiences. This book is as much/or them as it is
about them.

Like most of the work carried out by the Seafarers International Research
###### Centre (SIRC), this book was produced by a team of writers/researchers,
administrative staff and editors. Tony Alderton wrote the sections on trade
unions and wages and conditions of service, although the passages on cruise
ship wages and conditions were prepared by Minghua Zhao. Michelle Thomas
is the author of Chapter 6 and, together with Mick Bloor and Helen Sampson,
also wrote Chapter 5. Erol Kahveci supplied the data on turnaround times for
###### Chapter 4 and provided the analysis of abandoned seafarers in Chapter 7. Nik
Winchester wrote Chapter 2, while Bin Wu produced the statistical analysis
and graphics for Chapter 3. Tony Lane wrote the Introduction, Chapter 1,
those parts of Chapters 3 and 7 respectively dealing with crewing patterns,
labour market organization and sub-standard ships as well as the Conclusion;
he is also responsible for the final shape of the book. Louise Deeley produced
the final manuscript. The SIRC team are most grateful to Margareta Simons
for editing the study, and to Charlotte Beauchamp of the International Labour
###### Organization (ILO) for coordinating the publication.

A series of overarching structural changes transformed the world's shipping
###### industry during the last quarter of the twentieth century. The containerization
of the liner trades and the evolution of ship types dedicated to the carriage of
specific, or narrow bands, of commodity groups were the most visible
developments. On an organizational level, the industry saw the appearance of
large fleets run by independent ship-management companies and the eclipse
###### of nationally flagged fleets by flags of convenience (FOCs) and second
registers. Politically, environmental issues had an influence on geo-politics
generally and on the regulatory structures of world shipping in particular. Less
obvious, except to those involved in the industry, national regulatory systems
were progressively displaced by transnational and international ones, while the
locations of the shipping industry's core cities were restructured into a global
circuit of regional metropolises in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North
America. The most momentous structural change, however, was the
development of a global labour market for industrial workers.

###### Thirty years ago, most of the world's seafarers were citizens of the
nations represented in their ships' flags and ports of registry. In the early years
of the twenty-first century, not only are the crews of most internationally
trading ships working under foreign flags, they are also likely to be sailing in
mixed nationality crews. The causes, and especially the consequences, of these
changes are the subject of this book. Merchant seafarers of the new century
are unique among industrial workers. Among the higher echelons of workers

The global seafarer

in the financial services and information technology industries, it is common
enough to find mixed nationality teams. However, in the shipping industry
this implies a "factory type" workforce of more than a million people.
Recruited in accordance with managerial preferences, crews are assembled
###### through global networks of companies and agencies in many different permutations of nationalities. In aggregate form, the outcome of crewing
policies and national preferences has been that the majority of crews are
mixed: in 1999, 20 per cent of the crews of cargo ships had staff of more than
###### four nationalities and only one-third were drawn from a single nationality.
Aboard the world's cruise ships, there are rarely crews of fewer than 20
nationalities. Therefore, the title of this book, The global seafarer, can truly be
said to represent the reality of the modern seafarer's working life.

The industry's increasingly desperate preoccupation with crew costs,
which led to the formation of a global labour market, was a reflection of
trading conditions. The structural problem that the industry faced was
straightforward and can be summarized quite simply: a slump in world trade
and a glut of ships produced a spate of intense competition and the inevitable
accompanying drive to cut costs.

The 1980s were disastrous for shipping and by far the worst decade for the
###### industry since the 1930s. The problem was essentially twofold: on the one hand
there were the structural readjustments in the world economy, which led, in
1981, to a substantial fall in freight rates as world trade went into recession.
Subsequent recovery was prolonged, trade did not get back to 1980 levels until
1988 and freight rates thereafter generally showed only gradual and modest
improvements, despite short-lived booms in most other industries at some time
or other until the mid-1990s; on the other hand, and despite high scrapping
rates in the mid-1980s, there was a surplus of ships for available cargoes.

The recession of the 1980s has unquestionably left its mark on the
organizational structure of the industry. The ability of the shipbuilding
###### industry to supply cheap ships can still tempt ill-judged orders for new ships,
although in all sectors there are continuing attempts to at least manage market
uncertainties through vertical integration, consolidations through mergers and
###### other organizational forms such as "alliances" and pools. These and other
relevant economic issues, such as the development of ship-management
companies, the organization of ship finance and technological change, which
all have an effect on the labour market, are discussed in Chapter 1.

Labour was inevitably the first target when it came to making cuts, even
###### though crew costs as a proportion of voyage costs had been falling steadily since
the 1960s. By the 1980s labour productivity had already been substantially
improved by a series of capital substitutions, so it followed that any further
savings could only be made by finding cheaper sources of labour. These were

Introduction

achieved by avoiding the sophisticated labour regulatory regimes that had
evolved in the embedded maritime nations[1] and instead taking advantage of the
relatively cheap labour to be found in Asia, from the 1970s, and then in Eastern
Europe, from the late 1980s. The route to labour regulation avoidance was
already available in the shape of the FOC system, of which Liberia and Panama
are the earliest examples.[2] As soon as the effects of the downturn in world trade
began to bite, those who were already flagged out had an immediate competitive
advantage by virtue of their unrestricted freedom to recruit cheaper crews from
###### other world regions. In these circumstances, owners using bona fide national
flags generally had little choice but to follow suit if their governments were
unable or unwilling to provide subsidies through tax concessions. With an
offshore registry system in place and a marked move away from the politics of
social democracy towards free market policies in most of the embedded
maritime nations, the process of flagging out by shipowners who had
previously been strongly opposed to it was relatively uncomplicated. A number
of these nations (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands,
###### Norway and the United Kingdom) developed a variety of second register
alternatives to flagging out. Although these measures delivered the same
"domestic labour avoidance" solutions, they nevertheless retained some
aspects of labour regulation. These and other aspects of regulation and flagging
###### out are dealt with in some detail in Chapter 2.
 Chapter 3 covers developments in the labour market and is more
concerned with contemporary than recent historical questions, although the
opening pages provide some relevant background. The chapter analyses the
trends derived from recent SIRC global labour market surveys, which, for the
first time, allow a close examination of crewing patterns and the age and rank
profiles of seafarers from the newer labour supply countries. The role of crew
managers in defining and organizing the labour market is also examined and
critical questions of recruitment and training are explored. There is some
discussion of women seafarers, who, while in a tiny minority in the cargo
###### sector of world shipping, are a rapidly expanding presence in the cruise
industry. The chapter concludes with a survey of the role of trade unions and
collective bargaining in the new global era.

The four remaining chapters deal with areas that are more specific to the
everyday lives and experiences of the seafaring workforce. Chapter 4 focuses
###### on the social life of mixed nationality crews on board ship. The data are based
on a uniquely large-scale research programme conducted aboard working
ships, which found that, contrary to anecdotally based belief, mixed
###### nationality crews usually work extremely well together and are widely preferred by seafarers of all ranks. This is followed by some hitherto under- reported research on turnaround times and its impact on seafarers' lives.

The global seafarer

A survey of the limited information available on wages and conditions of
employment concludes the chapter.

The second chapter on shipboard life and work (Chapter 5) summarizes
the extremely limited research findings on food and diet, accommodation and
occupational health and safety. Considering the industry's growing concerns
about recruiting and then retaining expensively trained seafarers, none of these
areas has so far attracted much attention. Chapter 6, which looks at seafarers'
families, is largely informed by new research carried out in China, India,
Indonesia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom, and makes clear the need
for the industry to find ways of helping seafarers and their families to adjust to
long periods of separation. Chapter 7 deals with sub-standard ships and
abandoned crews, and examines the issues that affect the public's poor per-
ception of the shipping industry and which frequently unsettle those industry
professionals who pride themselves on operating well-found ships and looking
after their crews. As in every other industry, there is a group of marginal
operators whose deeds sometimes attract derogatory public attention.

As with so many other aspects of the shipping industry, far too little is
known in sufficient detail to allow for effective policies to be adopted.
Nevertheless, this book's conclusion is optimistic. The upheavals of the past
30 years are beginning to subside as new institutions and regulatory structures
slip into place. There are many indications that the labour market is at last
settling into a phase of relative stability, thanks largely to the powerful trend
towards consolidation of ownership in many key sectors, the development of
the machinery for global collective bargaining and the patent desire for
effective regulation among all those parties concerned with extending high
standards of professionalism across the industry.

Notes

1 In this book, the term "embedded maritime nations" replaces the more familiar "traditional maritime nations" to
provide a more accurate description of modern international shipping. Countries such as China, Greece, India, Malaysia
and the Philippines have been involved in maritime commerce for many centuries and are, therefore, unquestionably,
traditional maritime nations. However, only since the Second World War have these countries developed highly
organized shipping industry infrastructures comparable to those of Europe and Japan, where developments began 50
to 100 years earlier and so can be described as having become "embedded".

###### THE POLITICAL

 ECONOMY OF

 WORLD SHIPPING

Renewing identity

###### Introduction

The considerable changes that have taken place in the living and working lives of
seafarers in the past three decades are, unsurprisingly, related to developments in
the political economy of world shipping: long-term trends, contingent events and
structural flaws have all helped to produce an extremely complex state of affairs.
###### Although changing patterns in the direction and volume of world trade are conventionally seen as the underlying determinants of the modern transformation of the shipping industry, there have been, however, other
significant, contributory factors, and these are each examined in turn.

This chapter begins with a brief look at world trading patterns and the
problem of overcapacity in the 1980s. This is followed by an assessment of how
far the industry's patterns of ownership and financing contributed to labour
market instability. The privatization of the shipping industry in Eastern Europe
is looked at in this context. The organizational changes that occurred in the
###### industry are also examined by analysing the role of ship-management
companies in creating and stabilizing the global labour market. A concluding
section explores two regulatory issues that have had an enormous impact on the
industry: the first matter concerns the arrival of the environment as a major
political issue in the developed market economy countries on world shipping;
the second regulatory issue, and one that is examined at some length, is the
extraordinarily rapid development of "open" and second registers; they have
###### brought to the industry the institutional means of replacing multiple national

labour markets with a single global labour market, leaving only a residual and
declining rump of national labour markets.

###### Shipping and world trade

Considered overall, the past 30 years saw a period of steady, if patchy, growth in
seaborne world trade. In the 20 years from 1972 to 1992, the total tonnage carried
by the world's ships increased from 2,763 million tonnes to 4,211 million tonnes,
that is, by some 52 per cent (an annual average of 2.6 per cent). In the more recent
overlapping period, 1988-98, tonnage carried showed a further rise, from 3,675 to
5,064 million tonnes, that is, an increase of 2.8 per cent per annum. The overall
trends for three broad commodity groups are shown in figure 1.1. Taking the indus-
###### try as a whole, growth in the period was uneven, both in aggregate and among
commodity groups. In fact, aggregate seaborne trade fell by 400 million tonnes in
1981 and did not return to 1980 levels until 1988, reflecting the fact that the 1980s
was the worst decade experienced by the shipping industry since the 1920s and
1930s; the investment bank Warburg Dillon Read described it as a period of
"valiant but mutually destructive competition". In general, the most reliable index
reflecting world seaborne trade is industrial production in the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (figure 1.2).

Developments in the shipbuilding industry are not explored here in any
detail, although an outline is necessary, since part of the immediate cause of
the severe recession of the 1980s lay in the structure of the shipbuilding
###### industry in the 1970s. Recollections of the causes and consequences of the
1980s crisis are sufficiently fresh in the minds of shipowners and analysts in
the early years of the twenty-first century to make them alert to the likely
effects of an inflated boom in shipbuilding. This sensitivity to the possibility
###### of recent history being repeated surfaced at the 2001 autumn meeting of the Inter-Industry Round Table Group, which brings together the world's major
shipowning organizations     - the Baltic and International Maritime Council
###### (BIMCO), the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Intercargo and Intertanko. Leading representatives of these organizations called for a more
rational approach to additional shipbuilding capacity, stating that "moves
towards stability and equilibrium [in the shipping industry] could be
prejudiced by yards looking for short-term gains and increased market share".[1]

A flood of new and cheap ships launched from the subsidized and
###### protected yards of the world in the late 1970s and onwards into the mid-1980s undoubtedly helped to make a bad trading period worse. Despite a high rate of
scrapping in the early to mid-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that the
###### demolition-newbuild ratio (table 1.1) began to show a consistent pattern and

The political economy of world shipping

###### Although at the beginning of the twenty-first century the potential for future disruption from the shipbuilding industry has diminished, it has by no means
disappeared. Attempts in the late 1990s by the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO),
to manage capacity rationalization met with very limited success, while
disputes between the Republic of Korea and the European Union (EU) over
government subsidies were still unresolved at the time of writing.

There is little doubt that excess capacity is a continuing problem as
countries with established shipbuilding industries attempt to retain market
share against new entrants. It seems that as long as there are developing
countries with industrializing ambitions and an active international market
enabling the transfer of technical shipbuilding knowledge and ships' ancillary
equipment, the shipbuilding industry will be in a position to destabilize
shipping. By the mid-1990s, world shipbuilding capacity for the production of
all but the most specialized ships was centred in south-east Asia. One analyst
observed that:

[TJhere is now more than adequate capacity in the Far East to build every ship
the world needs and more. The sheer productivity increases of a reduced
number of Japanese yards, where improvement is recognized as the only route
to survival, and the capacity increases of the South Koreans and the Chinese
cannot be brushed aside as inconsequential.[2]

Some 18 months later, the issues involved were neatly synthesized in a
series of questions in a Lloyd's List leading article:

Will, for instance, we see a trade war between Korean and Japanese ship-
builders? Will, in the short term, there be any diminution in the wish of the
major Japanese corporations to maintain a shipbuilding presence, if this sector
cannot provide their parent corporations with a sufficient return on
investment? Will the continued overcapacity in world shipbuilding (and not
many people seriously believe that this situation is going to change) simply
wear down the Japanese will to remain in such an unrewarding sector? And
what will be the effect on world shipbuilding of the improved productivity in
China and Eastern Europe, or the political nuances of the EU towards its
shipbuilding sector?[3]

The commentator left the questions unanswered but, in a world
###### increasingly sceptical of economic protection policies (significantly
underlined by China's accession to the WTO in 2001), shipbuilding seems
certain to remain a mobile industry, with China as its next core destination.
The essential reasoning for this "restlessness of location" can be seen in the
unusually frank remarks quoted in box 1.1.

Box 1.1 Hyundai targets higher plain

The head of ship sales at Hyundai Heavy, D. Y. Han, hopes [the Republic of] Korea will
outgrow shipbuilding as quickly as possible. He makes this point as a spirited defence
of his country's shipbuilding prowess against European attack. "Eventually, Korea's
position in the shipbuilding world will be replaced by other countries, and I hope that
day will come sooner rather than later," he said. "This will be a sign that the level of
the South Korean economy has advanced to a higher level of development." He
pointed out that, in general, the advanced economies of the United States, Europe
and Japan had many other more lucrative and technologically sophisticated industries
in which to invest their capital and manpower. South Korea was, meanwhile, filling a
substantial need to replace tonnage. Productivity at Hyundai Heavy has been
improving every year, but Mr. Han does not want to be over proud. He sees other
nations, particularly China, gathering strength. "Some day, we will have to hand over
the market."

###### Ownership, organization and finance

 Ownership structures vary considerably between the different sectors of the
shipping industry. While the privately owned and public limited company
(PLC) forms of ownership can be found in all sectors, the largest firms as well
as those operating the more sophisticated ship types are more likely to be
equity-funded, listed companies, and these are found in those subsectors
where ownership is highly concentrated. Nevertheless, it remains true that, of
all the world's modern and large-scale industries, shipping seems to be the
only industry in which private ownership in one form or another still
predominates.

###### Throughout the twentieth century, the liner trades of all the embedded
maritime nations showed high levels of concentration. At the beginning of the
###### twenty-first century, the world's liner trades are, for the most part, owned by
a shrinking number of global firms. Similarly, a series of mergers, takeovers
and acquisitions during the 1990s progressively enlarged the major container
companies, leading to a situation in the early twenty-first century in which the
sector looks as if it will be dominated by perhaps as few as six carriers, each
with global route patterns. The largest existing carriers, which are certain to
become even larger, are not just owners of large fleets of ships running
"mainline" services; through their organizational alliances with other
companies and their vertical and lateral ownerships of ports and terminals,
warehousing, road transport, rail rolling-stock, freight forwarding agencies
and feederships, the liner companies of today are adopting exactly the same

sorts of strategies developed by the first consolidations in the liner trades of
the late nineteenth century.[4] It is notable, however, that some of the world's
largest liner/container companies also own large fleets of other ship types      -
###### Mitsui-OSK and A. P. Moller, for example, own diverse fleets that include car
carriers, tankers and bulkers. Economically, there is some logic in this
approach to shipowning, if only to spread risks, since the business cycles of
the different trades are incongruent. The year 2001 may have been bad for the
container trades but it was a reasonable one for tankers and it is interesting to
###### note that although Mitsui and Moller both turned in heavy losses from their
liner trades, they made useful profits from their tankers that year. Other liner
companies, such as the P&O Group, pursued in the late 1990s the then
fashionable "back to core business" strategy. In this industry, as in others,
there are always competing perspectives on strategy and development, but all
the large firms in the container trades, regardless of whether they also operate
in other shipping sectors, engaged in mergers in an attempt to protect their
market position by enlarging their market share. Exactly the same motives
resulted in parallel merger movements in other specialized sectors of the
shipping industry.

Since the late 1990s, there have been a number of significant mergers at
the larger end of the tanker trades, with ownership rapidly becoming
###### concentrated in a smaller group of companies. In this particular case, concentration has been driven by an increasingly tight regulatory environment
and the associated demand for more expensive double-hulled ships. The
pressure to meet ever-higher structural and operating standards means that the
companies that survive can only be those able to realize economies of scale. By
2001, just three companies     - Worldwide, MOL and Frontline     - controlled
more than 100 very large crude carriers (VLCCs) between them, almost one-
###### quarter of the world's VLCC fleet. The substantially over-tonnaged reefer
trades, a contracting sector that some suggest will need to halve its current
capacity, is threatened by the increasing capacity of the container lines to carry
###### frozen and chilled cargoes. Only the larger reefer companies with the more modern fleets are likely to survive.[5]

There are only two highly specialized shipping sectors where concen-
###### tration ratios approach those of the chemical and automobile industries:
interestingly, these are the chemical tanker and car-carrier sectors, two
expanding markets in which recent mergers have led to exceptionally high
levels of concentration. In the deep-sea chemical tanker trades, two companies
###### - Odfjell and Stolt-Nielson - have some 50 per cent of the market, and 70 per
cent of the market is controlled by four firms.[6] The picture in the car-carrier
###### sector is a little more complicated, since different owners are dominant in
different trades. Grimaldi, for example, dominates the Mediterranean to

11


-----

Europe and Latin America routes, while MOL, Wallenius Wilhelmsen, NYK
and Hyundai dominate the Far East routes. Nevertheless, the overall situation
shows high levels of concentration and, at the time of writing, negotiations
between Wallenius Wilhelmsen and Hyundai, where the latter seemed set to
sell its 70 plus ships to the former, suggest that Wallenius Wilhelmsen could
end up having some 50 per cent of the market (in a single fleet). In cruise
shipping, bankruptcies and mergers in the period 2000-03 contributed to
extremely high concentration ratios; as the entry costs into this sector are so
steep, the already small number of firms seems likely to diminish even further.

The shipping industry's two largest sectors        - bulk and general cargo        -
have low concentration ratios. In practice, and not unlike the products tanker
trades, these sectors are broken down into size categories. In the case of large
ships, such as cape-size bulkers, there are a number of reasonably stable pools,
whereby several owners hire out their ships at collectively agreed rates,
###### without mergers having actually taken place. This is a merger-like activity
except that individual owners remain responsible for operating their own
ships, do not normally pool all their ships and are free to leave the pool after
agreed periods of notice.[7] Pools represent a tacit recognition of the advantages
of scale but do not normally lead to mergers, even if they inevitably bring
###### competitors closer to each other. Outside the larger ship categories, there are
a number of owners with large fleets, but with the exception of those
operating in certain specialist sectors such as forest products, they are unlikely
###### to dominate their markets. The most competitive category of bulkers and
general cargo carriers are those running in the short-sea trades. Here again,
there are individual owners with large fleets as well as pools, but, in general,
ownership is fragmented and competition intense.

The most dramatic instance of change in the ownership structure of the
shipping industry came with the privatization of the Eastern European
shipping enterprises. Regrettably, there is no detailed or in-depth information
on developments in the major fleets of the former Soviet Union. There are the
bleak and almost farcical cases of the Romanian and Georgian fleets:
bankruptcy, malfeasance, abandoned and cheated crews, ships in appalling
conditions detained by port state control (PSC) agencies. The relatively well-
managed Yugoslav and Polish fleets went through a lengthy period of decline,
in the course of which large numbers of well-trained seafarers, officers
especially, quickly found employment in the flagged-out ships of the
embedded maritime nations (see the section on the global labour market in
###### Chapter 3). The East German fleet was quickly disposed of and officers
wishing to continue working at sea found employment on German-owned
ships. Developments in the Baltic States, Ukraine and the Russian Federation
were far more complex. In a number of cases, privatized companies were

12


-----

The political economy of world shipping

refinanced through offshore registration and subsequent bareboat chartering
back to the privatized company for manning by indigenous crews. In 2002,
###### there were large numbers of ships crewed and operated by Russians,
Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians that were mortgaged to
Western banks and mainly flagged in the Bahamas, Cyprus, Malta and Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines.

Privatization effectively left the former Soviet Union (including the
Baltic States) and its closer satellites, such as Bulgaria, with two fleets. The
newer and better ships were mortgaged in the West and flagged out to raise
capital and establish offshore companies beyond the reach of the governments
###### that had once owned them, while the older and presumably unmortgageable
ships remained with the national flag. The flagged-out ships, having the benefit
of Western commercial management experience, have generally fared better.
The high PSC, detention and abandonment rates experienced by Russian- and
Ukrainian-flagged ships and crews accurately reflect the relative fortunes of
the two fleets, although there are now indications that at least some of the
national flag fleets, especially those of the Baltic States, are rebuilding and
recovering. Overall, the main beneficiaries of privatization in the former
Soviet Union have been Western shipowners. Well-trained Soviet seafarers
###### found relatively well-paid and secure employment in the West, their arrival
coinciding with the area's growing shortage of well-trained officers.

Taking the industry as a global whole, bank loans are the prime source of
capital for funding the purchasing of ships and providing short-term working
capital on an ad hoc basis. Banks do not usually provide equity except when
###### restructuring misjudged historical loans. There are still some companies that
largely finance newbuilds or second-hand ships through retained earnings
(which was common practice until the 1960s), although this is no longer
widespread. The number of banks involved in ship finance varies constantly
and it is not unusual for one bank to sell its ship loans portfolio, either in
whole or in part, to another bank. Late 1990 estimates suggest that worldwide
there are about 40 banks continuously involved in ship finance on a large scale,
of which around 70 per cent are European, 18 per cent American and 10 per
cent Asian.

Bank finance only began to assume any importance in the financing of
the shipping industry in the boom years of tanker building in the 1960s. Such
was the rate of growth in crude oil shipments in this period that the traditional
###### method of financing newbuilds through retained earnings was no longer
adequate to expand fleets quickly enough. Furthermore, the then emerging
###### trend of building specialist ships for specialized trades also indicated the need for new sources of capital. Even the conservatively managed and equity-based
liner groups aiming to establish new niche sectors found themselves turning to

13

banks for loans. In the independent tanker and bulk trades, which are
dominated by private firms, bank lending was the only possible source of new
capital unless some control was relinquished by floating share issues. In the
mid-1960s, at least, there was little incentive to do this: so lucrative were time
charters from the major oil companies in this period that a bank loan of up to
90 per cent of the cost of a new ship could be paid off in five years.[8]

###### Commenting on this period, H. Sohmen, whose family firm is now the
world's second largest VLCC owner, said:

Many financial institutions entered shipping for the first time, confident that high
freights and expanding bulk trades suggested few risks in shipping. Syndicated
loans became a common way of financing the new generation of very large tankers
and bulkers. In the buoyant market conditions, a 220,000 dwt [deadweight
tonnage] tanker built for US$12-14 million in 1968 might be valued at $30 million
in 1971 and $47 million in 1973.[9]

Banks specializing in ship finance do not necessarily carry all or even
most of the debt. They may, for example, sell some or all of the debt on to
###### other organizations, which might be other banks or institutional lenders, such
as pension funds or insurance firms, although the extent to which this is
possible at any given moment necessarily depends on trading conditions in the
capital markets. In a buyer's market, it is not uncommon for implausible debt
to be bought by inexperienced and ill-informed lenders. The responsibility for
the financial collapse of Adriatic Tankers, with its 90-ship fleet, in the mid-
1990s can be evenly divided between a commercially incompetent owner and
five banks and institutional lenders, which between them contributed $244
million to the (private) firm's expansion.

The relative absence of PLC structures in shipping can make it difficult
for a bank to make a conventional assessment of a prospective loan. Apart
from the lack of any kind of historical data series to enable comparisons to
be made with the performance of other operators, a shipowner based
offshore might or might not have a balance sheet and is unlikely to have either
audited accounts or an impressive suite of offices providing apparently
tangible evidence of a well-run firm. In these cases, bank debt can still be
available on the basis of what is known as "relational banking"; that is to say,
where there is a continuing relation between an individual bank and an
individual owner, trust relationships often form the basis of long-term
sequences of lending.

###### When mortgages failed, as they often did in the 1980s, banks and other
lenders could either repossess ships, appointing a ship manager to operate
them until a buyer could be found, or the debt could be turned into equity,
thus making the bank an institutional shareholder. This latter option was never

14

popular and was only resorted to in cases where the debt was large and shared
by a number of other banks. For example, in 1986, the family-controlled firm,
Wah Kwong Shipping and Investment, the third largest shipping group of
former Hong Kong, owed more than $850 million to 46 creditors, who
eventually agreed to reschedule the debt as equity (boxes 1.2 and 1.3).

###### It may not be known precisely how private and public capital is divided
in world fleet ownership, but there is little doubt that equity funding is
becoming increasingly important in those sectors with high concentration
ratios. The cruise sector, in which ownership is most highly concentrated, is
dominated by public companies. In 1995, Drewry's estimated that there were
more than 300 shipping companies quoted on the world's stock exchanges,
with a total market capitalization of more than $30 billion. The pace of change
###### to PLC status, however, is unlikely to be rapid or uninterrupted, except
possibly in the liner and "liner-like" trades (for example, gas and chemical
tankers) and the larger end of the tanker trades, now that higher concentration
ratios suggest that freight rate movements will become less erratic and profits
more consistent.

For the medium term, relational banking is likely to remain predominant in
the least specialized bulk trades. The inherent risk in lending of this sort is
acknowledged by banks in that the exposure to any one owner is kept at relatively
low levels, even if the total exposure to shipowners is high among those
specializing in the shipping industry Lending of this kind, other things being
equal, will help to sustain fragmentation of ownership, speculation in the ship sale
and purchase market, and consequent freight market volatility. Continued
volatility will reinforce the sceptical attitudes towards the shipping industry
generally held by institutional lenders and thus ensure slow progress towards
concentration of ownership in all but the most specialized of the bulk trades.

There has been some debate over how far bank lending has encouraged
shipowners to buy speculatively, thus exaggerating freight market volatility
###### with all the attendant consequences for seafarers in respect of conditions of
employment. At the time of the Wah Kwong restructuring in 1986, R Slater, a
###### prominent shipowner/financier, said publicly:

To order a new ship, other than in the liner trades, without contractual
employment [that is, without a time charter] is a total speculation. To finance that
speculation with borrowed funds is an irresponsible gamble, and those banks who
provide funds for such gambles and describe them as loans are guilty of gross
deception.[10]

This is a persuasive argument for it was undoubtedly the banks' funding
of the speculative ship purchases, in the 1970s and 1980s at least, that led to
over-tonnaging, depressed freight rates and the consequent pressure on labour

Box 1.2 Troubled Hong Kong shipping company lurches on

By Michael Westlake in Hong Kong, China

With a promise of fresh but so far unquantified funding from China, a visit by the
founder and chairman to Japan and the arrest of two more ships apparently acting as
a spur for more creditors to sign a debt-rescheduling plan, Hong Kong's ailing third-
largest shipping group, Wah Kwong Shipping and Investment Co. (Hong Kong),
seems to have bought itself a little more time. The troubled company owes more than
US$850 million to 46 creditors.

Wah Kwong founder and chairman T. Y. Chao, whose family owns 45 per cent of the
shares, set up a meeting in Tokyo with the company's 21 Japanese creditors, which
collectively account for 40 per cent of the total debt.

The low point came on 24 September with news of two further ships being arrested
###### - the Venture Star in Rotterdam by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's US subsidiary
Marine Midland Bank and the Brazil Venture in Houston by the Bank of Montreal. But
in Tokyo on 25 September, Chao managed to persuade at least six more creditors to
sign up for the plan. The pian would give creditors control of Wah Kwong's board
"whenever they wanted it". Other creditors include the Bank of Tokyo, Sumitomo
Corp., Standard Chartered, Chemical Bank, Bank of Boston, Dresdner Bank and the
Royal Bank of Scotland.

Wah Kwong's troubles surfaced last year, when its confident expectations of riding out
the long-running shipping recession and its placing of orders for new ships while
prices were low were wrecked by a series of bankruptcies in other shipping
companies to which it had chartered ships.

Since then, Amex Asia, Wah Kwong's advisor, has succeeded in cajoling creditors into
agreeing to two successive interim plans to keep the company afloat white it assessed
Wah Kwong's long-term prospects. At that stage Chase [Manhattan Bank] went along
with the proposed rescue, in the face of attempts by Lloyds Bank and Citibank to go
their own way            - both were eventually persuaded to join in the interim plans.

Now, Chase is owed about US$30 million secured by mortgages on three ships         - the
Eastern Ranger, the bulk-carrier Sabodine Venture (arrested in New Orleans on 8
September) and the multi-purpose carrier Nigeria Venture. However, the market value
of all three now totals only about US$16 million, and Chase is not the only creditor with
regard to the Eastern Ranger.

A Chase spokesman told the REVIEW that in view of the depressed market values,
the bank might not try to sell the two arrested ships, but might try to find other work
for them. The bank had already agreed with Wah Kwong to sell the Nigeria Venture,
and the spokesman said that, contrary to earlier expectations, Chase would take the
proceeds of the sale instead of leaving them in the company as part of the
rescheduling agreement.

Box 1.3 Shipping      - Stay of execution?

By Michael Westlake in Hong Kong

Now, with Wah Kwong effectively owned by their creditors through conversion of
much of their debt      - US$2.6 billion and US$855 million respectively      - into equity, they
can operate as restructured companies with slimmed-down fleets without crippling
finance costs, and can thus compete in the marketplace.

But this type of rescue merely postpones what some see as a desirable       - even
inevitable        - further shake-out among shipping companies, and shifts the debt from
banks' loan portfolios to their equity portfolios. Depending on individual banking
nations' rules, these "investments" might be absorbed into banks' reserves or
perhaps treated as genuine long-term investments       - with up to 15 years before they
recoup their cost, according to one banker.

costs. Indeed, it could only have been the banks who were at fault, since
retained earnings and equity were no longer important sources of capital in the
1980s, least of all in the tanker and bulk trades where over-tonnaging was
especially severe.

The industry's structural problem of having too many ships to allow a
reasonable return on ships run to high professional standards could not be
resolved by the rescue operations the banks were obliged to mount if they
were not themselves to be driven into crisis. It was simply commercially
impossible for them to write off their assets by selling them for scrap, least of
all at a time when scrap prices were low. Therefore, the banks were obliged to
keep their assets at sea, trading and selling them at the first best opportunity.
As E Slater pointed out, the logic of the situation was ironic: "If anything, the
problems are compounded as ships sold or auctioned at a fraction of their
recent original costs then return to the market at rates reflecting their new low
value and thus continue to depress freight rates and cause further collapses."[11]

###### And yet, given the predominantly privately owned structure of the shipping
industry, bank lending will inevitably be a major source of funding for capital
projects, whether they are for private individuals or public companies.

###### Growth sectors: Containers and cruise

 Apart from roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) passenger ships mainly operating in near-
sea ferry trades, the powerful growth rates of the period were in the liner
trades and in cruise shipping (table 1.2). Whereas the container trades saw
steady growth for more than 30 years as they ate into more and more of the

17

The global seafarer

trades formerly served by geared 'tween decked cargo ships, the recent and
rapid growth in cruise shipping can perhaps be best compared with the
development of the packaged holiday industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Growth
in the liner trades was mainly centred on the development of two main types
of ship: mega-carriers dedicated to the mainline hub routes and feeder ships of
various sizes flexible enough in draft and carrying capacity to be switched
between spoke routes. The mainline ships offer probably the best employment
conditions for crews. By contrast, the crews of feeder ships often work long
hours in trades with rotations involving rapid turnarounds and sequences of
###### short-sea passages. Overall growth in the container trades is expected to
continue: in 1990, 12 per cent of general cargo was carried in containers and
27 per cent in 1999. The forecast for 2005 is a conservative 40 per cent.[1][2]

###### From the perspective of seafarers, by far the most important growth was
in cruise shipping, not least because for the first time it involved a high level
of demand for women seafarers. The number of cruise ships of 1,000 gt and
over in the world cruise fleet rose from 147 in 1980 to 225 in 1998, with gross
tonnage having increased from 2,045,000 in 1980 to 6,307,000 in 1998. The
###### number of passengers carried rose from 1.5 million in 1980 to 7.5 million in
1998 (table 1.3). The search for economies of scale in the cruise sector led to
the introduction of the "mega" ship of 100,000 gt or more, with a berth
capacity of 3,000 plus passengers; one of the newer ships, Voyager of the Seas,
owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises, weighs 142,000 tonnes and has a capacity
of 3,000 passengers and 900 crew. The larger cruise companies are based in
Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States. Following the 2003
merger between Carnival and P&O Cruises, the Carnival Group now owns
some 30 per cent of the world's cruise ships of more than 4,500 gt. In 2002,
Carnival and P&O Cruises combined carried 39 per cent of the world's total
cruise passengers. The world's five largest owners and operators in 1999 are
listed in table 1.4.

###### There are considerable economies of scale to be had from operating
large cruise ships with 2,000 to 3,000 lower berths. Both capital costs and
###### operating costs per passenger decrease rapidly with the increase in ship size.
Indeed, operating cruise lines has become so profitable that, in 1999,
Carnival reported a net income of $157.8 million for its first quarter, a 44 per
###### cent rise on the previous year, making it the 31st consecutive quarter that the
company has reported improvements. Royal Caribbean also reported an
income growth of 16.3 per cent for the first quarter, from $77.5 million in
1998 to $90.2 million in 1999. The current economic "prizes" to be found in
this sector are considerable. However, the entry costs are high and this has
###### ensured the existence of only a small number of firms and a high merger rate.
This sector of world shipping is also especially susceptible to political
###### disturbances: cruise shipping was seriously affected by the events of 11 September 2001. And although it is possible to move ships between the main
markets in North America and Europe, the economic benefits of doing so
are marginal.

###### The rise of the ship-management company

The long crisis of the 1980s found the shipowners of the embedded maritime
nations looking for radical solutions. Some left the industry to focus on other
parts of their business. For example, the large British firm Ocean Transport
###### (better known as Blue Funnel) progressively sold its shipping interests and
became a logistics company. Others flagged out their ships to "open registers"
of one kind or another, which allowed them to make large and immediate but
unrepeatable one-off labour cost reductions. In 1983, during one of the several
peaks of this exodus, H. Sohmen sharply commented that "relative advantages
based on only lower manning costs are impermanent and will not finally save
even the most cost-effective operator".[1][3]

Some companies turned to managing ships for other owners as a means
of utilizing spare management capacity. For example, in 1983, P&O won a
###### contract to manage four tankers owned by one of the Gulf States, and
managed another 15 ships for various other companies. Some companies have
###### continued this practice, albeit on a small scale: BP-AMOCO runs several
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tankers for a Saudi Arabian company.

###### Third-party ship management, although not unusual among established
shipowners in the embedded maritime nations, used to be on a small and
almost incidental scale. In the United States, however, it became a specialist
business in the 1950s, when American owners built up substantial Liberian-
flagged tanker fleets. Probably the first major step towards the setting-up of
similar businesses in Europe came in the 1960s, when the family-owned
###### Scottish tramp company, Denholm's, quickly became a specialist when it took over the management of a substantial part of what had been the Naess
fleet. Ship management as a recognizably specialist sector in world shipping
###### then grew rapidly, initially in Hong Kong in the 1970s, where professionals
were needed to operate the ships bought mainly by financial speculators and
###### then to continue operating them on behalf of banks when these speculations
failed. By contrast, the growth of specialist ship-management companies in
###### Europe followed, on the whole, the "Denholm pattern", growing as extensions of, or spun off from, existing shipping enterprises, mainly in
Germany, Monaco, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Switzerland and the
###### United Kingdom.
 In-house management buyouts or the creation of self-sufficient but
wholly owned subsidiaries of technical and personnel management services
###### started to become extremely common among many of the larger shipowning
companies; many of these offshoots evolved via mergers or takeovers into the
now-familiar ship-management companies of the 1990s. Some became very
successful and grew rapidly in the 1980s. Success was due, in no small part, to
the fact that many shipowners were looking for ways to cut their overheads
and saw in these new organizations the possibility of getting some of the
benefits of economies of scale that were hard to achieve in-house. Economies
were especially likely to be found in the area of crew management because of
the difficulties involved in hiring crews either wholly or in part from cheaper
###### but unfamiliar world regions. In these circumstances, subcontracting to
specialist firms became attractive.

As ship-management firms continued to develop and expand, they
eventually developed into the world's largest employers of seafarers. Such is
the scale of their labour requirements and their consequent need for efficient
organization that they have collectively become a powerful source of labour
market stability. Unlike shipowners with small fleets who may be recurrently

The political economy of world shipping

driven by circumstance to look for new and cheaper sources of labour, ship
managers (with perhaps 5,000 seafarers spread over 200 ships) need orderly
and predictable supply lines. By the mid-1990s, a number of ship-management
companies had become seriously involved in the training of officers, with at
least two of them running cadetships in the manner of some of the now-
defunct British liner companies. Others had set up their own training
establishments for ratings.

By the late 1990s, ship managers could be found in both the old and the
new métropoles of world shipping: in Europe, in Hamburg, Glasgow, the Isle
of Man, Piraeus and Cyprus; in the United States, in and around New York;
and in Asia, in Hong Kong (China), Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The
managed fleets typically embrace a wide range of ship types, flying various but
mainly open register flags and with owners and crews drawn from a number of
different countries. For example, the mid-range firm, Univan, founded in
###### Hong Kong in 1973 by a Belgian shipmaster, has a fleet of 70 plus ships flagged to the Bahamas, Cyprus, Hong Kong (China), Liberia, the Norwegian International Ship Register (NIS) and Panama, of which the major owners are
located in, in order of magnitude, Norway, the United States, India, Japan, and
the United Kingdom. The crews are mostly made up of Indians (90 per cent),
###### then with nationals from Myanmar and the Philippines.[1][4] Other companies
have a similar range of clients but usually draw upon a wider range of crewing
sources: V-Ships, for example, employs large numbers of Russians, while
Barber International's main sources of personnel are India, the Philippines
and Poland.

The ship-management market is as stratified as any market. According to
2000 estimates, eight companies with fleets of 100 plus ships have about 36 per
cent of the ship-management market and ships under management have
increased from about 3,500 in 1900 to 5,000 in 2000     - a compound growth rate
of 3.5 per cent per annum. In total, these estimates reveal that some 25 per cent
of the world fleet are under third-party management.[1][5] Among these third-
###### party managers are a large number of small firms managing less than 15 ships.
Firms in this range do not have the resources to have vertically integrated
organizations with tied agencies in the labour supply countries and are,
therefore, more likely to be "footloose" in sourcing crews.

In at least the medium term, the organizational imperatives of the larger
ship managers ensure that at any given moment they have a strong interest in
sustaining the status quo in the labour market. They have established dense
and personalized networks in the labour supply countries, often reaching into
training and educational institutions, and social capital of this kind is not easily
accumulated. On the other hand, the interest and investment in stability
provide no guarantee of its continuation. It would take only one large

-----

ship-management company to seek short-term competitive advantage by-
opting on a large scale for a significantly cheaper source of labour to send
###### competitors off in pursuit. The effects would be similar to those produced by
the flight to offshore registries in the 1970s and 1980s.

The ship-management sector, though still growing, has now entered its
mature phase and companies no longer grow mainly through mergers with
small firms but through large firms taking over other large firms. In 2001,
V-Ships became the largest ship manager with its takeover of Acomarit, thus
assembling a fleet of 500 plus ships. Later in the same year, Anglo-Eastern
###### took over Denholm's ship-management business, with a combined fleet of 200
plus ships.

The main centres of ship management are in northern Europe (including
the Nordic countries), Greece, south-east Asia (principally Hong Kong,
###### China and Singapore), Japan and the United States, and its main customers are
from the same countries and regions. Some estimates now suggest that
perhaps 10,000 ships have at least one of their functional areas run by third-
###### party managers. Ship-management functions are conventionally designated as
commercial (involving charters, mortgages, insurances and so on), technical
(ship maintenance, dry-docking, periodic surveys and so on) and pertaining to
crew management (the finding, organizing, payment and training of crews).
By the mid-1990s, the ship-management sector was sufficiently well-
established to launch the International Ship Managers' Association (ISMA).
In 1994, ISMA members alone managed 1,800 ships totalling 60 million dwt;
a further 1,053 were fully managed (that is, commercially, technically and in
the management of crew), 717 were solely under crew-management contracts
and another 70 were under other forms of service contracts. More than 80 per
cent of managed ships flew second register or FOCs, with the remaining 20
per cent flying national flags. The total seagoing labour force of ISMA
members was approximately 50,000, mostly from Eastern Europe, India and
the Philippines. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the clients of the
ship-management companies are, for the most part, small- to medium-sized
shipowners, but by virtue of the central management provided by the
managers for all their clients, it might be said that ship-management
companies provide at least some of the benefits of scale otherwise only found
in large and powerful shipping companies.

###### Technological developments

The main innovative development of the past 30 years was the introduction of
satellite communications, which had two main consequences for ships'
personnel. Firstly, direct and immediate contact between ship and shore

22


-----

The political economy of world shipping

###### management became possible, which allowed and often led to the implementation of continuous, as distinct from hitherto interrupted, "line
management". Secondly, the radio officer's role was displaced by the intro-
###### duction of electronic distress and safety communications. Otherwise, and aside
from the separate development of high-speed craft, technological change took
the form of new developments in existing innovations, the most significant of
which was the introduction of the automated engine room with a day-working
complement; there is now only a rapidly dwindling number of ships with
manned engine rooms.

The shipping industry had been steadily adopting automation and
###### integration technology since the 1960s, and they are now applied to most
shipboard systems; today, integrated bridge systems are a standard feature on
new ships. The bridge has become an information and control centre for all
shipboard functions, including navigation, propulsion and communications,
and the layout of this system has more in common with an aircraft's cockpit
###### than with the traditional wheel-house arrangements centred on navigation.
The most radical changes were in ships' engine rooms: during the 1970s, the
###### introduction of computers to monitor and control propulsion systems meant that machinery spaces could be left unattended; in the early twenty-first
century, most seagoing vessels operate with automated machinery spaces and
engineers no longer keep watches. The main effects of deck and engine-room
###### automation and integration have been a reduction in manning levels and
changes in work organization and shipboard environment.

The introduction of satellite communications began in 1976, when the
###### International Maritime Organization (IMO) established the International
Maritime Satellite Organization, which later became the International Mobile
Satellite Organization (INMARSAT), to provide emergency maritime
communications. Since then, communication satellites have greatly improved
###### not only safety and distress communications but also public correspondence
and fleet communications between shore and ship. On 1 February 1999, the
###### implementation of the integrated system of satellite and terrestrial
communications     - the global maritime distress and safety system (GMDSS)     -
heralded a new era in ship distress and safety communications, improving the
accuracy and response time to distress calls originating from ships. All
passenger and cargo ships over 300 gt engaged on international voyages are
now required to participate in GMDSS by having the appropriate equipment
###### on board and trained personnel (almost invariably navigating officers) to
operate it. The role of radio officer consequently disappeared. The use of
satellites for better fleet communications, data transfer and operational
###### control is revolutionizing the way ships are managed. The primary applications
of integrated ship-management systems between ship and shore are:

23


-----

The global seafarer

         - reporting systems, including automatically recorded data, such as noon
###### position report, engine performance, cargo condition and manual input
from deck, engine and port logs;

         - weather routing;

         - cargo/load calculations and procedures;

         - management system maintenance;

         - interactive electronic manuals for shipboard procedures;

         - computer-based training modules;

         - condition monitoring of the main engine.

These developments in shipbuilding technology led to a rapid increase in
ship size, matched by advances in cargo-handling equipment and port
###### infrastructure. The bulker and tanker sectors have now reached a stage where a further increase in ship size, although technically possible, is not commercially
viable. Other shipping sectors also saw a marked increase in ship size over the
past decade, the outstanding example being container vessels. In less than two
decades, ship sizes doubled, from Panamax (3,000-4,000 TEUs[1][6]) to the latest
generation of post-Panamax vessels (6,000-8,000 TEUs). It is highly probable
###### that new generations of ships may reach the 12,000 TEU level, although, as with
ultra-large crude carrier (ULCC) tankers, port-handling constraints will surely
limit the number of ships with very high capacities.

In the past two decades, the use of high-speed craft (typically, catamarans
and hydrofoils) has been rising rapidly in coastal areas around the world,
mainly for passenger services, although larger craft are able to carry heavy
goods vehicles. As supply chains in different industrial sectors move towards
###### integration and ever higher efficiencies, the demand for high-speed craft for transporting commodities is likely to grow, although the publicly announced
transatlantic high-speed service has been experiencing difficulties in raising the
necessary capital. In the short term at least, these sorts of crafts will have to
prove themselves in shorter-haul trades: as yet, shipowners in these trades are
showing little inclination to move away from conventional higher speed ships.

###### Containerization, first introduced in the 1960s, remains the most important development in cargo unitization. Although container systems
require a high initial investment, their benefits include extremely fast rates of
handling and seamless links with other modes of transport. Container ships
are equipped with special features specifically designed to optimize efficiency
of handling operations. Cellular guides partly do away with the need for
lashing cargo prior to a sea passage. Easy access to holds dramatically reduces

24


-----

The political economy of world shipping

the turnaround time in port. In some cases, handling rates are so fast that even
shipboard ballast pumps cannot keep up with the trim and draft requirements
of loading/unloading operations. The speed with which cargo operations are
###### conducted also means that cargo calculations and stowage on board need to be
carefully made in order to minimize errors, which quickly become "buried"
###### under stacks of containers, making it extremely expensive and time consuming to rectify. Turnaround times measured in single digit hours are now close to
the norm for container services.

###### Politics and shipping

Towards the end of the twentieth century two unrelated sets of events and
developments brought the shipping industry to the attention of governments,
particularly to those of the established embedded maritime nations. The first
was a sequence of highly publicized strandings and other incidents involving
oil tankers,[17] which came at a time when environmental issues were entering
the political mainstream in the developed economies. This led directly to the
###### formation of the first PSC regime, which came about as a result of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), an agreement initially reached by a
group of Atlantic and North Sea coast countries in 1982. The signatories
agreed to a programme of ship inspections aimed at ensuring compliance with
###### IMO Conventions.[1][8]
 The second developments were the introduction of second registers
(from the mid-1980s) and pro-shipping taxation policies (from the mid-1990s)
in Europe. The aim of these two measures was to retain the institutional
###### infrastructures (of shipowning, banking, insurance, classification, brokerage,
ship management and so on) of the industry. Although politically necessary
gestures towards increasing the training of national citizens as seafarers were
made in some countries, policies were primarily focused on retaining these
###### infrastructures: extensive shipping infrastructures, such as those of Denmark,
Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom, are substantial
earners of foreign currencies and, therefore, make important contributions to
###### their respective countries' balance of payments. Inevitably, there will be some
movements of companies between the industry's metropolises, but at least for
the foreseeable future there are few strategic reasons for any infrastructural
sectors to move sites. In a "wired world", the economic benefits of changing
###### location are too marginal to be worthy of serious consideration.

Politically, the industry sees the world as a "quasi-single state" in the
sense that its political arenas are either agencies of the United Nations, such
as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International
Labour Organization (ILO), or the string of international associations whose

leading figures are widely known throughout shipping's infrastructure. It is
commonly said that global shipping is a village in which, even if everyone is
###### not known to everyone else, it is not hard to find an intermediary who can
make an introduction. In these situations, it is easy to see how global this
###### industry is and, at the same time, hard to see why it should change direction.

###### 2

 FLAG STATES AND

 REGULATION

Maintenance work

###### Introduction

 One of the primary responsibilities of a flag involves regulating the activities
of the ships flying its flag. Indeed, it is the duty in law of the flag to maintain
a regulatory environment that encompasses the following: the operation of the
ship; the physical status of the ship; the activities of the shipowners; and the
###### working conditions of the seafarers. The flag, in the first instance, underwrites the safe operation of those ships under its flag.

The principal legislation affecting ship registration is the United Nations
###### Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 10 December 1982. Article
91 of the Convention states that:

Every State shall fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, for the
registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag. Ships have the
nationality of the State whose flag they are entitled to fly. There must exist a
genuine link between the State and the ship.[1]

###### Under current practice, this Article has been interpreted as enabling the
flag to set the conditions for registering a ship as it sees fit.[2] In so doing, the
flag can define its regulatory environment autonomously. Article 94 of the
###### Convention, entitled "Duties of the flag State", states that "every State shall
effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and
social matters over ships flying its flag".[3] Article 217 of the Convention,
###### entitled "Enforcement by flag States", describes these functions in more detail.

27

The global seafarer

However, as M. Stopford states: "As far as the flag of registration is concerned,
the 1982 Convention endorses the right of any to register ships, provided
there is a 'genuine link' between the ship and the states. Since the flag can
define the nature of this link, in practice it can register any ship it chooses."[4]

When shipowners elect to register vessels under a specific flag, they
become subject to a particular regulatory environment that entails a number
of rights and obligations. Because of the current enactment and interpretation
of international law concerning ship registration, flag States enforce and define
these rights and duties in any manner they see fit. In short, shipowners can
choose which environment they feel is most amenable to their approach to
vessel operation.

The aim of this chapter is to look at the development, trends and impli-
cations of the varying practices of regulation in the maritime industry. The
discussion has a number of objectives, namely to:

          - identify the key trends in vessel registration;

         - look at the impact of these trends on vessel operation;

         - consider the range and kinds of regulatory practices occurring in flag States;

         - locate the overall picture of the regulatory qualities of forms of flag States;

         - discuss the reasons why this situation has occurred and consider the
###### prospects for the future.

 FOCs and second registers

Flagging out vessels to States other than the shipowner's own country of
origin has a long history. In the earliest examples of this phenomenon,
shipowners usually did this for political or military reasons, while the grounds
for the more recent examples are much more likely to be economic. It is only
in the period between the two World Wars, however, that certain nations
###### (Honduras, Liberia and Panama) were specifically developed as "open" or FOC registers,[5] that is, States that will accept the registration of vessels from
any other nation with only minor restrictions.[6]

The latter half of the twentieth century saw a significant shift in ship
registration from embedded maritime nations to open registers. Whereas in
1950, Liberia and Panama, the two major open registers, accounted for 6 per
cent of tonnage registered, by 1975 this figure had risen to 27 per cent.[7] In
more recent years, the trend towards open registers has continued. In the
period 1990-2001, the number of vessels in the world fleet increased by 16 per
cent, while during the same period the number of vessels registered with all

28


-----

Flag States and regulation

###### FOCs increased by 70 per cent. The gross tonnage figures are even more
revealing. During this period, total world tonnage increased by 106 per cent,
while FOC tonnage increased by 90 per cent (figures 2.1 and 2.2). The average
size of open registered vessels in 2001 stood at 15,647 gt, roughly two-and-a-
half times larger than that of the world fleet in general at 6,533 gt.[8]

Equally clear is the extreme concentration of the open register fleet. The
five largest open register fleets      - the Bahamas, Cyprus, Liberia, Malta and
Panama    - account for 60 per cent of the total in terms of the number of vessels
and for 84 per cent of the total FOC gross tonnage (table 2.1). These five also
###### account for 14 per cent of the total world fleet in terms of numbers and 45 per cent in terms of gross tonnage. Some States are expanding their fleets more
rapidly than others. The four fastest growing fleets between 31 December
2000 and 31 December 2001     - Cambodia, the Canary Islands, Gibraltar and
Luxembourg    - were all open registers, and all had gross tonnage growth rates
in excess of 30 per cent. Conversely, however, two of the ten fastest shrinking
fleets in this period were also FOCs, with Belize showing a decline in gross
tonnage of 18.8 per cent.[9]

###### The lack of a substantial economic link between shipowners and the flag for most of the vessels registered to FOCs is most graphically depicted in an
analysis of the beneficial ownership of such fleets. Seven out of ten of the
major flag States, ranked by total deadweight tonnage, do not feature within
###### the top 35 embedded maritime nations in terms of beneficial ownership.[1][0] Of the five largest FOCs, most of the deadweight tonnage on the Maltese and Cyprus registers is owned by Greek interests and 40 per cent of the
Panamanian fleet is controlled by Japanese owners (table 2.2), while there is no
significant tonnage owned by nationals of any of the seven flag States
concerned.[1][1]

###### It would once have been conceivable to speak of a British-flagged ship,
owned by a British company and crewed by British seafarers, but this kind of
single nationality ship operation has now become the exception to the norm.
Because of the growth of FOCs (both in terms of tonnage and the number of
States offering such facilities), the sourcing of labour from many nationalities
and the appearance of single-ship style offshore company incorporation
(indeed almost without exception open registers offer tax-free offshore
###### company incorporation at minimal cost and transparency), the structure of
ship ownership has become a complex and, at times, opaque affair.

As a response to intensified competition in the market for ship reg-
###### istration, from the late 1980s onwards a number of States have created second
registers to provide some or all of the advantages of open registers while
simultaneously maintaining a primary register. The aim is to minimize the loss
###### of tonnage from a flag by effectively encouraging a shipowner to remain under

the auspices of that State while benefiting from a number of enticements such
as lower taxation and less regulated crewing requirements. This action is the
pragmatic recognition of the force of international competition from open
registries        - and of their competitive advantages because of their flexibility.

 In terms of numbers, there are 26 registers that can be classified as
second registers, a list of which is given in table 2.3. The creation of these
registers began in the late 1980s with the French Kerguelen Islands in 1987,
the NIS in 1987, the Danish International Ship Register (DIS) in 1988,

Note: 1 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is authorized by the Chinese Government to

an administrative region means that it is, technically, a second register. As discussed above, this does not imply the form
of the relationship between Hong Kong and China.

Portugal's Madeira in 1988, and the German International Ship Register (GIS)
in 1988. After this initial period of activity, there was a significant lull in the
###### further creation of second registers, with the sole exception of Spain's Canary
Islands (1992). However, since 1997 there has been renewed activity in this
area, with the creation of a Turkish second register in 1997, a Brazilian register
and an Italian second register in 1998.

The blanket term "second register" does not necessarily indicate the form
###### of the relationship between the primary and second register or the rationale and operation of their respective registers. A number of these second registers are
extremely small and show little, if any, growth. Furthermore, they cover only
small ships. Their status as a second register is due to the fact that they are based
in a non-metropolitan territory of another State, although in terms of shipping
registration there may be no formal links with the State's primary register. These
registers can be classified as non-active, in terms of both their operations and
international significance. The following seven registers can be included in this
category: Anguilla; British Virgin Islands; Channel Islands; Cook Islands;
Falkland Islands; Turks and Caicos Islands, and Wallis and Futuna Islands.

###### Other second registers are active in the flag market as well as significantly autonomous in their operations, but they do not exist solely with a view to attracting shipping from the metropolitan State. The relationship between the territory and its State tends to be visible through the content of laws. For
example, in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, the principal shipping
legislation in force is the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Acts; the Isle
of Man's legislation is also principally based on these Acts.

###### Although a number of second registers are in fact "open", they are at
once similar to and different from most open registers. The Red Ensign
###### Group, the Canary Islands and Madeira may be run as commercial enterprises, but because all these various territories have a formal and legal and political
relationship with embedded maritime nations that have well-established
###### regulatory frameworks, they are susceptible to "home State" intervention. In
the case of the Red Ensign Group, for example, there may not be any formal
###### control, but there is no doubt that the British Government has begun to take
an active and almost monitoring interest in its operations. The same is no less
###### true of the Spanish and Portuguese Governments in respect of their territories' registers. Where Denmark, Germany, France and Norway are
concerned, their international/second registers are all formally administered
###### by bona fide agencies, which, in their practices and their personnel, are hard to
tell apart from what might be called their "first" registries. These registers are
###### not run as commercial enterprises. They have been set up by the home State
and their purpose is the preservation of the home State's maritime industry
###### infrastructure. In original intention and in fact, they are typical examples of
the sort of defensive economic development strategy to be found everywhere
in Europe and variously applied to cities, regions and industries.

Activity in the early years of the twenty-first century suggests that the
###### option of utilizing a non-metropolitan territory has become less attractive, and
new second registers are exclusively concentrated in the nominal constitution of
second registers within the primary countries themselves. Both the recent second
registers and those countries engaged in debate over this issue favour this option.
The disadvantages attached to the use of a non-metropolitan territory led the
French Government to agree, in 2003, to set up a second national register within
France, the French International Ship Register (FIR), to replace the Kerguelen
Islands. Concerning the attempt to retain tonnage, the GIS has been the most
successful. When Germany introduced its second register in 1988,52 per cent of
German tonnage was registered abroad; the figure subsequently fell to 38 per cent
###### but was up to 65 per cent in 1997.[1][2] According to Germany's Federal Office of
Maritime Shipping and Hydrography, 96 per cent of German-registered tonnage
appears on this register. The GIS is also unusual in terms of second registers in
###### that only ships acceptable to the primary register may be entered on it.

###### FOCs and second registers are steadily becoming more important within the global maritime industry, although the reasons for this may be diverse. As
suggested by Bergantino and Marlow, "flagging out is primarily caused by the
desire to minimize costs".[1][3] The same authors also suggest, however, that
###### other factors such as the quality of available labour, management costs, fiscal
considerations and questions of effective control are important elements in
such decisions. The ITF is even more explicit on this point:

FOCs enable shipowners to minimize their operational costs by, inter alia, tax
avoidance, transfer pricing, trade union avoidance, recruitment of non-
domiciled seafarers and passport holders on very low wage rates, non-payment
of welfare and social security contributions for their crews and avoidance of
strictly applied safety and environmental standards.[14]

This definition does, however, overlook one vital point: although it is
probably easier for open registers to minimize their costs in such ways, some
national registers are as equally deficient in these respects as the worst FOCs. The
data on detention and casualty rates, for example, also reveal that many national
flags have extremely poor records. The average global detention rate in 1998 was
6 per cent,[15] and of the 39 countries who exceeded this rate (table 2.4), ten were
###### FOCs whose combined total gross tonnage represented just 20 per cent of the
entire FOC fleet. A similar pattern emerges when considering the list of targeted
flag States defined by the various PSC regimes. The 2000 Port State Control (PSC)
Report of the American Coastguard lists 13 countries on its targeted list; of these
nine, or 69 per cent, are FOCs.[1][6] Of those flag States that exceeded the three-
year detention rate of 7.1 percent (1998-2000) in the Asia-Pacific region (Tokyo
###### MOU), six, or 35 per cent, of these were open registers.[1][7] Nine of the 26 States
appearing on the "black list" in the 2000 Paris MOU report are open registers,
###### with FOCs accounting for 35 per cent of those States identified as "very high
risk" in the black list.[18] Making similar comparisons on the basis of second
registers is problematic in that second registers, which are centrally run and
operated, are normally included within the statistics for the first register of that
particular State. However, none of the second registers for which figures are
available appears on any of the targeted lists produced by PSC regions.

As for the number of casualties (that is, ships lost), the picture is similar.
###### Of the 21 States whose losses as a percentage of its fleet exceeded the world
average losses of 0.1 in 1998, eight were FOCs (table 2.5) and their combined
###### total gross tonnage accounted for only 25 per cent of the FOC total. Once
again, comparisons with second registers are difficult, as in most cases the data
elide the difference between primary and second registers. Where data are
available, only one second register (the Isle of Man) reported a loss rate above
the world average in 1998.

The growth of open registers shows no sign of abating, in terms of both
the percentage of tonnage registered to them and the number of States opting
###### to enter this market. Second registers have become an increasingly popular
choice for embedded maritime nations as a way of maintaining a national fleet.
However, the extent to which this strategy is effective remains to be seen over
the medium to long term. Evidence concerning the consequences of the
dominance of open registers is somewhat inconclusive. However, it is clear
###### that the claim that all FOCs result in poor vessel maintenance and operation
is simply not true. Although some FOCs report high rates of detention and
losses, these are matched, and sometimes overtaken, by a number of national
flags, although none of these could be termed embedded maritime nations.
Regarding second registers, the evidence is somewhat sparse, owing to the fact

37

The global seafarer

###### that many of the data do not make a distinction between primary and second
registers within a flag State.

Although PSC rates and vessel losses may give an indication of the standards
of vessel operation in flag States, these data say little of the actual regulatory
practice of different types of registers in the flag market. Additionally, because
PSC inspectors concentrate on matters of vessel standards, the data do not
provide much insight into how these flags regulate and interact with seafarers.
In the following section, these aspects of regulatory practice are discussed in
greater detail in order to examine the forms of regulatory environment on offer
in the vessel registration market.

###### Regulatory regimes and practice

The development of open registers has led to the appearance of flag States with
highly divergent histories in the regulation of vessel operations. Additionally, the
competitive nature of the flag market has meant that the type of regulatory regime
offered affects the economic viability of the flag itself. When a shipowner is
deciding which flag to choose, the regulatory regime offered by the flag is an
element that will influence this choice. Maintaining stringent standards is a cost
element to the shipowner with an obvious effect on the profitability of ship
operation. It is because of these developments that different regulatory regimes
in the marketplace for ship registration have emerged.

###### The nature of these differences is examined in the rest of this chapter by
way of a number of illustrated examples, followed by a brief analysis of the
development of these differences.

PSC statistics continually point out the differences in the physical standards
of ships on different registers; reports from trade unions and welfare organi-
zations describe similar variations in both the working conditions and treatment
of seafarers. Many of them can be considered with reference to the varying levels
of regulatory control exercised by flag States and styles of regulatory environ-
###### ment enacted by them. There are a number of dimensions that characterize
the kind of regulatory regime put in force by a flag State, namely:

           - the extent to which the shipowner comes under the regulatory authority
###### of the flag States;

          - the extent of the existing rule of law;

           - the extent to which the context of the flag provides resources to counter
###### the effects of the breakdown of power.

 These aspects are analysed by examining: the extent of ratification of international Conventions; the requirements for registering a vessel; health-

Flag States and regulation

screening procedures; welfare provision; seafarer training; and general labour
issues. This list is not designed to be exhaustive but is a selection of the range
and types of activities that flag States are involved in regulating.

###### Prior to discussing specific examples of regulatory practice, it is worth
taking a brief look at international law. International Conventions represent a
sustained attempt to harmonize regulations pertaining to ships and seafarers in
the globalized maritime sector. Indeed, the effective regulation of the maritime
###### sector depends, in the first instance, upon the ratification of these Conventions by flag States. The international Conventions applicable to
seafarers derive from two main sources, and these are discussed in turn.

###### IMO Conventions concern the various aspects of the operation of ships.
These define the required standards for ship operation in terms of the physical
standards of the vessel; the minimum standards of competence of the seafarer;
and certification requirements. Those that relate to the "human factor" in
ship operation are not concerned with general labour conditions, such as
###### contracts and welfare provision, but focus on issues of crew competency and
certification. There are 53 IMO Conventions; table 2.6 below shows the
###### extent of ratification for a selection of flag States.

The highest level of ratification of IMO instruments occurs in those flag
States that are often termed embedded maritime nations, with new entrants to
the flag market, such as Bolivia and Equatorial Guinea, showing the lowest level.
###### Although a number of open registers do have fairly high rates of ratification, for
example, the Marshall Islands and Liberia, in general they tend to have noticeably
lower rates of ratification than the embedded maritime nations.

There are a large number of ILO Conventions that apply exclusively to
the work of seafarers, the most important of which is the Merchant Shipping
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 147). This Convention extends
previous instruments and reiterates the commitment to those Conventions
already in force. It is aimed at ensuring that there are laws or regulations by
countries for ships registered in their territory that adequately provide for:
safety and health on board ships; appropriate working and living conditions
aboard ships; the training and qualifications of seafarers; and appropriate social
security measures for those working on ships. In 1997, the ILO noted that:

Convention No. 147 has become the basic point of reference in the maritime
industry for minimal acceptable standards on living and working conditions of
seafarers. Although more than 50 per cent of the world fleet is now covered by
this instrument, six of the top 15 shipping countries have still not ratified it:
Panama, Bahamas, Malta, China, Singapore and the Philippines.[19]

In comparison with embedded maritime nations, open registers have
significantly lower rates of ratification of this instrument. Additionally, the

time delay in ratification is often substantial. For example, Convention No.
147 is dated 1976, yet the Bahamas did not ratify it until 2001, Cyprus in 1995
and Barbados in 1994 (a notable exception is Liberia, which ratified this
###### instrument in 1981). By contrast, embedded maritime States have tended to
ratify the Convention with greater speed, for example France ratified it in
1978, Norway in 1979 and Greece in 1979. This also applies to international
labour Conventions in general: open registers ratify fewer Conventions and
do so more slowly than embedded maritime nations. In fact, both Vanuatu and
the Marshall Islands are not even ILO member States.

###### Although the content of the laws gives an insight into differences in regulatory regimes, the question of enforcement must be borne in mind. As
the IMO has noted: "The enforcement of IMO Conventions depends upon
the Governments of Member Parties. Contracting Governments enforce the
provisions of IMO Conventions as far as their own ships are concerned and
also set the penalties for infringements, where these are applicable."[20]

Similarly, the ILO document, Characteristics of international labour standards.

Flag States and regulation

declares that "transforming these universally accepted goals and rules into a
binding legal obligation is each State's sovereign privilege".[21] International
regulation in the maritime industry is enacted on a State-by-State basis and the
flag itself is entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing these standards.
Such enforcement is not uniform across flag States. As an example, the
Panamanian administration has an annual budget of about $20 million and
6,245 vessels, whereas the British administration has an annual budget of $78
million to monitor and control a fleet that is less than a quarter of the size of
the Panamanian fleet. It is clear that such budgetary differences will result in
differing enforcement capabilities, and shows that States attach different levels
of priority to the enforcement of these Conventions.

###### Control over the quality of the vessels flying the flag of the State is, in
the first instance, determined by the requirements that need to be fulfilled
before a ship is registered. If a flag is only interested in increasing the number
of ships on its register, irrespective of their condition, then the registration
requirements will be, at best, minimal, and, at worst, of no consequence at all.
Clearly, if a State establishes lax procedures, then it has displayed limited
###### interest in maintaining the quality of ships appearing on its register and is often placing the shipowner outside the regulatory network of the State.
In the United Kingdom, the eligibility requirements are as follows:

           - British citizens;

           - Citizens of an EU member exercising their rights under Articles 48 or 52 of
the EU Treaty in the United Kingdom;

           - British Dependent Territories citizens;

           - British Overseas citizens;

           - Companies incorporated in one of the European Economic Area (EEA)
countries;

           - Companies incorporated in any British overseas possession that have their
principal place of business in the United Kingdom or those possessions;

             - European Economic Interest Groupings.[22]

By contrast, the requirements of the Maltese flag are less stringent:

All types of vessels, from pleasure yachts to oil rigs, may be registered,
provided that, inter alia, they are wholly owned by Maltese citizens or Maltese
bodies corporate. The formation of a Maltese company is a straightforward
operation; there are no nationality requirements as to both the shareholders
and directors.[23]

The global seafarer

Panama has even weaker minimal restrictions. Its registry does not require
the owners of a vessel to be nationals and it accepts vessels for registration as long
as they have a legal representative in the country. There are also no age limitations
for vessels. This absence of restrictions as to age, type and size of vessels makes
almost any vessel eligible for registration. Cambodia's regulations are even more
lax. There are no restrictions on the ownership of any vessel registered in the
Cambodian Ship Registry. Any legal entity capable of owning vessels under the
law of the country in which it is established or domiciled may be registered as
owner. Any vessel used in navigation, including non-propelled vessels, fishing
vessels and pleasure yachts, can be registered. Additionally, the Cambodian
Registry operates a 24-hour service and is able to process applications within an
###### hour on the strength of faxed documentation alone. Provisional registration is
available on the payment of fees and a temporary safe manning certificate can be
issued without even a cursory inspection.

###### It is clear that there is a sliding scale of stringency in terms of registration
requirements. Although the United Kingdom and other embedded maritime
nations seek to restrict eligibility, FOCs attempt to open up these restrictions
as far as possible         - to the furthest extent in Cambodia, where there are no
###### restrictions at all. Although a number of registers may require company incorporation, this is undermined as a means of placing the shipowner within
the regulatory network of that State by the nature of the rules governing
offshore company incorporation.

The link between open registers and offshore company incorporation is
clear. Most FOCs offer offshore company incorporation at low cost and
demanding minimal participation within that State; indeed, it represents a
###### further enhancement of the income-generating property of the register.[24] For
example, offshore company incorporation in Panama can be effected in 24
hours at a cost of $2,600: there are no requirements for local meetings,
###### directors or company secretaries; there is no government register of share-
holders; and there are no requirements for the company to submit either
annual returns or accounts. The growth of open registers and single-ship
companies is synonymous.

###### The status of company law as it pertains to non-resident companies is an important consideration in determining how far shipowners can place
themselves at arm's length from their investment. Significant benefits can be
gained from registering an offshore company in a particular jurisdiction.
Whereas the registration of a ship under a flag will confer taxation advantages,
the incorporation of a company under that flag (whose assets are limited to
###### that ship alone) attracts the additional advantage of limiting liability by restricting company assets to a minimal level; and the prevention of the arrest
of sister ships in lieu of a maritime lien.

42


-----

In general, corporations act within States and, therefore, have an impact
###### on that State. In terms of the maritime sector, the effect upon that State is often
at a distance; therefore, the responsibility of corporations to a flag State is
substantially more complex. On 5 October 1999, Norway unveiled a proposal
###### to link shipowners' tax liability directly to their environmental performance. The Government of Norway's draft budget recommended increasing tonnage
tax by 50 per cent universally, and then offering rebates on it to shipowners
whose fleets score highly on the so-called "environment factor" index, scaled
from zero to ten. This system came into force in January 2000. Shipowners may,
###### on a voluntary basis, submit an environmental declaration, which, according to the score on the index, can give them a maximum discount of 25 per cent on
the tonnage tax. This form of legislation is a simple and novel method of
###### introducing the concept of public responsibility into the shipowning corporation through the auspices of the flag State.

Carrying out surveys of ships enables the flag to monitor the quality of
vessels that are accepted on that register. Although most registers offer some
form of provisional registration, all require a ship survey, or a certificate of
survey, before permanent registration is granted. However, the regulations
###### pertaining to surveys differ across flag States.
 United Kingdom regulations are carried out under the auspices of the
MCA. On the issue of surveys, the MCA states that:

Every ship must be surveyed before it can be registered. MCA's general policy is
for this survey to be carried out by an MCA surveyor; however, under certain
circumstances, arrangements can be made for this survey to be carried out by a
class surveyor on behalf of the MCA.[25]

Additionally, the process of ship surveying is ongoing and not simply
routine:

We [the MCA] will carry out unscheduled inspections on United Kingdom ships,
including small passenger ships, fishing vessels and foreign registered cargo and
passenger ships using United Kingdom ports. These inspections will check for
compliance with national and international safety, pollution prevention and crew
welfare standards. Some inspections will target one particular feature or item of
the ship and its operation in depth, for example, packaged dangerous goods.[26]

By contrast, open registers require only a survey certificate issued by a
classification society. Attempts to control standards of inspection have
included restricting the number of classification societies authorized to carry
###### out such surveys. For example, the Bahamas has authorized only seven
classification societies and Liberia only authorizes surveyors if they are a
member of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS).

43


-----

However, a number of registers, such as Cambodia and Tonga, accept survey
certificates from virtually all such societies and show a distinct preference for
###### their own network of surveyors. Although this may look like a return to regulatory control, it is in fact another source of income generation. These
inspections are conducted by independent surveyors operating on behalf of
these flag States, with little centralized control over their operation.

###### It is clear that some ships are operated in a non-compliant manner, and it
is the responsibility of the flag to take action where such deficiencies occur.
The British administration noted that:

Vessels which fall short of the required standards will be subject to sanctions
depending on the seriousness of the deficiencies found. These include the
detention of the vessel in port, the suspension of its certificate, or the issue of
improvement and prohibition notices which prevent the use of a specific
practice/equipment until defects are rectified.[27]

###### The suspension of registration means that a ship may not carry on trading under that flag, nor can it be legally reflagged elsewhere.[28] The problems with the vessel must be rectified or else it will no longer be allowed to trade legally.

By contrast, Cypriot regulations accept international PSC action as
prima facie grounds for deleting ships from its registry. Although this may
appear to be a commitment to improve standards, it is a withdrawal from the
responsibility of the flag State. The deletion of a ship from a register leaves the
ship free to flag itself elsewhere, without being forced to make any changes to
###### that vessel. The suspension of registration represents a tool for exercising control over the shipowner, while the deletion of registration represents the
flag renouncing control.

###### Flag State good practice

 It could be expected that an administration committed to maintaining the
welfare of seafarers would involve itself in health-screening procedures for
seafarers serving on board vessels flagged to their State. Indeed, it could be
argued that it is within the remit of any effective flag to be involved in health
screening as a matter of course. An absence of such procedures suggests that
the flag shows limited interest in the status of seafarers.

###### Norway's regulations, which apply to ships flagged to both the primary
and the second (NIS) registers, are as follows:

The Seamen's Act of 1975 (as amended by regulations in 1986,1989, 1992 and 27
January 2000) specifies that any person accepted for service on Norwegian vessels

44


-----

over 25 grt [registered gross tonnage] (or over 100 grt in the case of fishing
vessels), shall, after a medical examination, produce a health certificate issued by
a doctor indicating that the person is medically fit for duty. Certificates must be
based upon thorough examinations carried out pursuant to instructions issued by
the Directorate of Health, and must be renewed annually. Those doctors issuing
certificates must not only be registered medical practitioners, but must also
provide the Maritime Directorate with proof of their knowledge of the health
conditions of seafarers, and show probability of providing medical examinations
of seafarers on a scale large enough to maintain and further develop their
competence in maritime medicine. There is an appeal mechanism for those
seafarers declared unfit for duty. A health certificate issued to an EEA national can
be accepted, provided the doctor issuing the certificate is approved by the
authorities of the country concerned.[29]

###### In contrast to this active approach to health screening, the Panamanian administration takes a somewhat more passive role. Although there is an
acknowledgement of the need for some kind of health screening, the
###### administration itself is not involved in the process to any significant degree.
A seafarer on board a Panamanian-flagged vessel has the right to receive an
###### identity card issued by the Panamanian Government. In order to receive this
card, the seafarer must make an application at the Panamanian Consulate
armed with a medical certificate, three photographs and documentation
###### listing the applicant's experience and/or training. Although this approach is
passive, it at least acknowledges the need for health screening of some kind.
However, in administrations such as those of Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea
and Honduras there is no involvement in the health screening of seafarers in
any way.

###### One of the factors that reveals the commitment to maintaining the well-
being of seafarers serving on board ships flagged to their State is the provision
###### by that flag State of welfare services. These provisions show that the flag State
is taking an active role in promoting the welfare of seafarers. Once again, there
are significant differences across registers.

###### Of all flag States, Norway has the most extensive welfare provision. The Norwegian Government Seamen's Service provides cultural and recreational
activities for seafarers on board Norwegian/NIS-flagged vessels, including:
language courses; a library service; a newspaper service; leisure parcels; a
magazine service; photography competitions; a sports service; shopping and
sightseeing; social services; and video films. These services are provided
directly to the seafarers at home, through their shipping companies, local
stations or contacts in Norway and in ports around the world. The providers
of these services work closely with other welfare bodies, such as the

45


-----

###### International Seafarers' Clubs. The newspaper service includes English,
Filipino, Indian, Norwegian and Polish newspapers and magazines. The library
service includes boxes with English or Norwegian books that circulate among
the ships, or a personal service sent directly to the seafarer. Seafarers can
choose from a wide range of languages and other types of educational material
and courses are also available.

Similarly, the United Kingdom has a well-established role in the
###### provision of welfare services. The principal establishment concerned with the
welfare of seafarers in the United Kingdom is the Merchant Navy Welfare
Board, a registered charity that has more than 44 constituent members
engaged in all aspects of seafarers' welfare. It is governed by a council of
management, consisting of equal numbers of representatives of shipowners,
seafarers' trade unions and national charities. The principal objectives of the
###### board are to assess the welfare needs of merchant seafarers and their
dependants, and to coordinate the work of the societies and charitable
organizations concerned with providing these services.

###### In contrast to this pro-active and extensive understanding of welfare
provision, open registers tend to restrict welfare to either repatriation or
disability payments. Panama's regulations are that if a seafarer is temporarily
disabled, the seafarer is entitled to full wages for up to two months and then
60 per cent for up to ten months while disabled. In the case of partial or total
###### permanent disability, the seafarer has the right to a pension for two years based
on 60 per cent of his or her salary. An officer who has served 12 months of
###### uninterrupted service is entitled to paid annual leave of 18 days per years of
service and ratings to 12 working days per years of service. Cyprus has no
specific contributions for the welfare of seafarers other than a provision in the
annual budget for the rehabilitation and repatriation of distressed seafarers.
###### Rather than understanding welfare as an ongoing issue, these administrations treat it in its most restricted form: welfare is relegated to the regulation of
activities when things go wrong, rather than being seen as a way of improving
###### the quality of life at sea.

A flag involved in the training and education of seafarers is one
###### exhibiting a more extensive involvement in the maritime sector than merely providing a service for the registration of ships. This involvement allows a
State to control and maintain the standards of seafarers plying their trade
###### around the world. Where there is a close relationship between the flag State, the shipowner, the training of seafarers and the sourcing of labour from that
flag State, the flag is in a strong position to maintain and enforce standards
of the seafarers serving on board its vessels. However, the widespread resort
###### to FOCs and second registers has severed the links of common citizenship between shipowners and seafarers and between training/certification and the

46

Flag States and regulation

flag State. It has also signalled the diminution of comparable levels of
###### competence and remit across all flag administrative agencies. The ITF has noted that:

There are very few significant manpower suppliers among the FOC flags. FOCs
do not engage in the expense of training crew. They leave it instead to the
developing countries which supply the crews and to individual shipowners and
managers.[30]

An illustration of the extent to which the link between training and ship
registration has been severed can be found in the BIMCO/International
Shipping Federation (ISF) 2000 Manpower Update. In reference to this report,
the ITF noted that:

In 1995, demand for crew on Panamanian ships was 54,559 officers and 49,862
ratings         - a total of 104,421 seafarers. The fleet has grown in size since then, and
yet the contribution of Panama to the manning of the world fleet as at year 2000
was just 325 officers and 2,611 ratings. The Marshall Islands, the 14th largest fleet
in the world, supplied only 40 seafarers.[31]

In terms of training provision, there are certain general characteristics of
open register:

      - The register is either privately operated, hence the training of seafarers is
###### not within the remit of the register operator, or the register is run but its
sole purpose is to generate income from the registration of vessels, hence
it is not involved in seafarer training.

      - Registering a ship under the flag does not require sourcing labour from
###### that State.

      - There is hardly any training of seafarers in that State.

There are two main consequences of this situation: the involvement
within the maritime sector by FOCs is restricted to the process of registration
itself; and the shipowner's responsibility is restricted to fulfilling limited
registration conditions.

Where States do train seafarers, such provision is not directly related to
the vessel register itself. The Philippines is by far the largest supplier of
seafarers to the world fleet (providing some 230,000 seafarers) and there are
over 50 maritime training establishments within the State. The regulations
governing the shipping register of the Philippines indicate that all crew
members on board Filipino-flagged ships should be Philippine nationals
(except in the case of specialized vessels). However, this is the full extent of

47


-----

The global seafarer

###### the responsibility of the shipowner when opting for this flag. The shipowner
is not required to contribute in any way to training.

###### Almost without exception, there is no connection between the registration of a ship and the wider participation of the shipowner in the training of seafarers. However, the United Kingdom has recently developed a
regime in which this link is, to some degree, re-established. In exchange for a
###### preferential tonnage tax regime on the British flag, the shipowner needs to
make a training commitment:

A company participating in the tonnage tax regime will have to meet a minimum
obligation to train one cadet per year for each 15 officer posts in existence on the
vessels operated by that company, or where this is not possible, to make a cash
payment to the Maritime Training Trust in respect of each training place which it
is unable to offer. The Maritime Training Trust and the Department for Transport,
Local Government and the Regions (DTLR) will supervise the training
requirement.[32]

The maritime administration of the United Kingdom is, therefore,
###### putting a wider remit of responsibility onto the shipowner. In exchange for a
reduced tax burden, the shipowner accrues additional responsibilities and
becomes a true participant in the maritime sector of that State.

In sum, open registers restrict themselves to the vending of flags. The
###### constitution and understanding of the role of these registers mean that
seafarer training occurs neither in that State, nor is it the responsibility of
shipowners. Even where States are significant providers of training, this is not
related to shipowners flagged to that State; training and ship registration are
###### entirely separate. Only the British tonnage tax system attempts to place the shipowner in the wider maritime field of training provision, thus establishing
a wider understanding of the implications of ship registration and the
###### regulatory remit of a flag State.

 Regulatory regimes and labour issues

 During the last few decades of the twentieth century, many industrialized coun-
tries deregulated their labour markets. In the shipping industry, the elaborate
networks of institutions experienced a process of attrition as national labour mar-
kets gave way to a global labour market. Both with respect to safety standards and
labour market regulation, the world's shipping industry is in a transitional stage
between weakening national regulation and strengthening newly emerging global
regulation as the industry rediscovers that an orderly labour market is an asset to
the industry as a whole. Despite the fact that the role of international regulation
is fully recognized as far as technical issues relating to the ship and its operation

48


-----

are concerned, the need for global regulation of conditions ofwork and life through
the relevant ILO standards is not so fully appreciated.

By the 1970s, after more than a century of development, the structures,
institutions and organizations concerned with seafarers looked remarkably
similar in all the embedded maritime nations. Naturally, political systems and
practices varied from country to country, but whether it was Japan, France or the
###### Nordic countries, the State, shipowners, seafarers and various ancillary
organizations (typically with charitable status in Europe) had developed ways of
working together to produce orderly systems of "regulation". The market was
regulated through a legal framework that specified standards of technical
competence, shipboard safety, work discipline, accommodation and victualling,
crew engagement and discharge    - including the keeping of registers of seafarers.
Training and education were provided by the State or by State-supported
###### institutions, with governing bodies based on "constituency of interest"
principles. The terms and conditions of employment and crew recruitment were
settled and supervised by corps of permanent officials working to agreed rules
and precedents agreed by representatives of shipowners and seafarers. National
and local committees considered matters of health and welfare.

Shipowners and seafarers' representatives, examiners and surveyors,
senior civil servants, nautical college principals, Missions' chaplains and
officers of various charitable organizations in their specific roles     - but also as
members of various industry-based committees    - all took part in a "regulatory
system" that was so similar in its effects and applied to such a large proportion
of the world's internationally trading ships that it effectively set or applied
###### international standards. In this context, ILO standards were applied,
sometimes without ratification. This regulatory system, where the actors were
familiar with ILO standards, served as a vehicle for the application of the
relevant instruments. The weakening of the system lay not so much in its
standards but in its rootedness in national institutions that, by themselves,
were unable to resist the impact of globalization. As soon as it became possible
###### for shipowners to make substantial short-term reductions in labour costs by
flagging out, it was inevitable that the regulatory labour systems that had been
###### introduced and nurtured by the traditional and nationally based players of the international shipping industry would be dismantled. Whether British,
German, Japanese or Norwegian, these players nevertheless had a shared
###### understanding of the basic conditions of good practice.

In the opening years of the twenty-first century and in those countries
with increasingly large registers, few representative organizations of the social
partners, especially of seafarers, still exist. Consequently, there is no national
###### tripartite machinery for the consideration of labour issues. The national
consultations required in the application of ILO standards do not function

49


-----

properly. There are no national lobbies to give priority to maritime labour
issues and, as a result, progress on these issues is slow.

As the examples given above illustrate, there are a number of differences
in the type and extent of the regulatory environment displayed by flags. In
summary form, these flags can be placed into three general categories.

1. Regulatory efficient States in which the State seeks to regulate the full
extent of maritime operations. These flag States are run centrally from
###### within governmental structures. From the initial survey of the ship
before its registration to the welfare provision of seafarers, these States
seek to provide an efficient and effective regulatory environment backed
up by both the full range of international law and effective political will.
Examples of such flag States are Norway and the United Kingdom.

2. Regulatory inefficient States. Within such States there is generally a
somewhat opaque route between the shipowner and the flag States.
Vessel registry tends to be nominally owned and privately operated. The
registration requirements are not negligible but nor are they stringent.
The ratification of IMO Conventions tends to be moderate and
responsibility for compliance is passed onto classification societies. The
main distinction between this category and regulatory efficient States lies
in the treatment of labour issues: welfare provision in its widest
definition is, at best, moderate, and, at worst, perfunctory, and is
reflected in low ratification levels of international labour Conventions
relating to seafarers. Examples of such flag States are Liberia, Malta and
Panama (in general, the established open registers).

3. Unregulated States. The regulatory environment within these registers is
almost non-existent. The register is privately operated. The link between
the shipowner and the flag State is extremely minimal. The ratification
rate of ILO and IMO Conventions is low and there exist few, if any,
###### structures or personnel in both the flag State and register operator that
could enforce these effectively; additionally, there is little political will to
enforce these Conventions. These registers provide a regulatory-free
environment for ship operators to act in a manner of their choosing with
little regard for the consequences. Examples of such registers are
Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Tonga.

The first and second categories present two very different prospects in
terms of regulation. The regulatory environment of the first group is positive
and extensive and covers all aspects of ship operation. This environment is
weakened in the second category in which ships and seafarers are treated quite
differently. In the former category, the regulations are limited to certain

50


-----

minimum acceptable standards of ship condition, which are monitored by
classification societies. As for the latter, restrictions, regulations and the
enforcement of labour standards are minimal, with little political will involved.
The third category is an intensification of the tendencies of the second:
shipowners can carry out all aspects of ship operation in an almost totally
unregulated environment. Of course, within these three categories the flag
States also exhibit differences: some have slightly more stringent survey
requirements than others; some provide minimal welfare procedures, where
others provide none; and flag States have ratified differing numbers of
international Conventions. However, these general categories still offer an
insight into the styles of regulatory environments that exist in the flag market.
Hence, it is necessary to ask why such a situation occurred.

Those flag States that belong to the regulatory efficient group can be
termed embedded maritime nations. For some considerable time, they have
built ships, owned ships, trained and provided seafarers, financed and insured
ships, and registered ships. Indeed, the registration of ships is but one element
in an extensive range of maritime operations carried out within the State. Such
States have been involved in the regulation of all aspects of the maritime
###### industry for some time. Regulatory structures have had the time to create a
coherent and effective regulatory environment. Additionally, specific maritime
expertise has developed and become entrenched within the State and,
importantly, within the State's bureaucratic apparatus.

Additionally, these States conform to a broadly defined, liberal democratic
model. This has meant that routes have been developed in which interest groups,
in both the spheres of capital and labour, can present their case and effect a certain
degree of influence in the operation of the flag State. These groups are consulted,
as a matter of routine, in major changes to the flag State. These States have also
been centrally involved in the creation of international regulatory structures and
thus the harmonization of the rule of law as it applies to both ships and seafarers.
With the recent development of second registers within these States, the onus
###### turned to enticing shipowners by offering enhancements to make ship operation
as profitable as possible. These changes relate, generally, to: removing national
crewing requirements; reducing taxation rates (or introducing preferential
tonnage tax schemes); and reducing registration charges. However, these changes
have not had a detrimental effect on the regulatory environment. So, for example,
although nationality requirements have been modified, health-screening and
certification procedures remain unchanged.

###### Although such a history and understanding of the nature of the flag
within these nations might go some way to explaining their regulatory
efficient nature, they cannot be identified as the sole causes of regulatory
efficacy. The specific historical trajectory of these embedded maritime nations

51


-----

led to this efficiency, but this type of historical evolution of regimes is not the
###### only way in which to achieve effective regulatory environments. Open
registers could conceivably seek to reproduce the regulatory structures, com-
prehensive legislation and enforcement capabilities of the embedded maritime
###### nations in order to produce a regulatory efficient environment. However, it would take a substantial change in the constitution and operation of the flag
State, and such a situation has singularly failed to occur; the reasons behind
this relate to the nature and development of the open register market.

###### Without exception, open registers are run on a business model. Their aim
is to maximize profit by increasing revenue streams and keeping costs low. The
###### competition is further intensified owing to the unique nature of the maritime
industry. Usually when an organization wishes to locate a production site, the
decision results in a certain investment implication. If, after that decision has
###### occurred and been carried out, another State offers a more attractive business environment, the time and cost consequences to relocate could be both
considerable and prohibitive (for example, new premises may have to be built
and staff recruited and trained). Making the choice of flag, the shipowner does
###### not have to take these kinds of issues into account. The thoroughly globalized nature of the maritime industry and the subsequent separation of ownership, control and crewing from the remit of the flag mean that the shipowner can
make a choice of flag that can subsequently be easily altered. Following the
###### regulatory requirements prescribed by flag States is within the cost/benefit
analysis of the shipowner. Hence, the regulatory environment maintained by
###### the flag becomes a matter that affects the continuing profitability of that
register. A unilateral increase in regulatory standards would have severe effects
###### on the attractiveness of a ship register to both new and existing clients and therefore lessen the profit-making potential of that register.

The advent of a systematic method of vessel inspection within the PSC
system has meant that the quality of ships appearing on a vessel register has
become an issue in the revenue-generating properties of a shipping register.
Where the vessels of a flag are shown to be of a consistently poor standard, ships
flying that flag become targeted: they are more likely to be inspected; the
###### probability that a ship is detained may rise; and insurance rates may increase on
the basis of that flag.[33] This alters the cost involved in operating a ship under a
particular flag. In such an environment, the flag has to maintain a balance between
###### regulatory levels that attract the shipowner but deter the attentions of PSC
inspectors. Therefore, maintaining a certain level of standards under IMO
regulations becomes an issue in the successful operation of a register. The split
between the formal conditions of vessels and certification requirements, con-
###### trasted with the labour conditions reproduced in the ambits of the IMO and ILO
respectively, plus the fact that PSC inspectors have focused almost exclusively

52


-----

on IMO factors, has meant that the issue of regulatory environments has focused
on the ship and not the seafarer. Thus, the seafarer remains in a highly unregulated
condition in the absence of effective control by the flag State.

Regulation has developed because of economic concerns and not because
of an understanding of the flag as a site for effective regulation. Free markets
are notoriously bad at producing regulations for themselves; it is only when
regulations affect profitability that regulatory enhancement occurs.[34] Indeed,
regulation is often considered to occur at the intersection of the government
and the economy. Where the political system acts as a receiver of monies and
ship registration exists wholly within the economy, the potential for effective
regulation is diminished. Where the ship registration is understood as solely a
revenue generator, the flag State is unlikely to put an autonomous check on
the ships registered to it. Indeed, were the State wishing to impose some
authority, the ease at which a ship can "hop" to another flag may threaten the
economic viability of that register. In fact, one of the features of the gradual
increase in regulation by established FOCs has been the emergence of super-
unregulated registers, such as those of Bolivia and Cambodia (a peculiarity of
the flag market is that the start-up cost and time required to create a flag State
is minimal). So it could be said that the steady increase in regulation in open
registers may lead to a certain level of deregulation overall.

The market for vessel registration is increasingly dominated by open
registers, and in the absence of an external shock to the system, this trend is
likely to continue. The rise of second registers has occurred as a response to
this situation, although the long-term success of this tactic is by no means
assured. Not only has the tonnage registered to FOCs continued to rise, but
recent history has shown a significant increase in the number of open registers.
There is no simple correlation between the type of flag and general indicators
of vessel condition and operation. However, there are clear differences in the
kind of regulatory environments offered by flag regimes. The specific
###### conjunction of the characteristics of the modern maritime industry has led to
a tiered nature of regulatory regimes, the factors of which can be summarized
as follows:

      - the freedom of flag States to determine the conditions for the
registration of ships;

       - the likelihood of ship registration being run on a profit-making model, as
the operations of flag States may be privately owned;

       - the highly competitive market for ship registration;

       - the separation of ownership, control and crewing of the vessel from the
flag;

53


-----

         - the ease with which vessels can change flags;

         - the extreme opacity of vessel ownership;[35]

         - the low barriers to entry into the flag market.

Because of these features, flag States have emerged with little expertise in
regulating the maritime industry (or any international regulation per se) and
###### with no well-developed structures in which the interests of capital and labour
can influence policy, all within a situation in which increased regulation can
affect income streams. It may be going too far to suggest that embedded
maritime nations are wholly committed to maintaining standards in an
###### altruistic way. However, by virtue of the register operating within and controlled by the political structure of a State in which there is sufficient
expertise and funding, regulation becomes a semi-autonomous factor in the
###### constitution of the regulatory environment, and one that is informed and
influenced by interest groups. In this way, there is no need to rely on the
###### market as the source and impetus behind the effective regulation of both ships
and seafarers.

Companies International Maritime Forum (OCIMF) established the Ship Inspection and Report Exchange (SIRE),
a ship inspection database accessible to both members and non-members. The scheme was designed to ensure that
ships taken on hire by the oil majors met good structural and operational standards. As the SIRE system has
developed, it has become increasingly concerned with the competence and conditions of service of the crew. Within
just three years of operation, the London ship-broking community was persuaded that it was no longer possible to
fix a sub-standard ship with any of the oil majors. The SIRE regime, taken together with the state-based PSC system,
has received support from all the industry's representative organizations and has undoubtedly gone a long way
towards improving safety generally and especially for crews. It is fair to wonder, however, how much of this new
regulatory regime would have developed without the arrival of the environment as a major political issue and whether
this kind of strategy could be effective in a sector without the particular characteristics of the oil-tanker market.
35 This can be explained by looking at profit maximization; offshore company incorporation can be included within
the profit-generating capabilities of shipping registers.

###### THE LABOUR

 MARKET

 FOR

 SEAFARERS

Seafarers of Turkish, Sierra Leonean, Indonesian, Egyptian,
Maldivian and Filipino origin at boat drill

###### Introduction

The last two decades of the twentieth century saw the emergence of a global
labour market for seafarers. The associated development of a worldwide network
of agencies and organizations dedicated to crew management made it possible for
crews to be recruited from different regions of the world. This chapter discusses
these developments and examines modern crewing patterns from the perspectives
of rank, nationality and gender, and the effects of globalization on crew com-
position, recruitment practices and certification and training.

###### National labour markets have not been entirely eclipsed. But now that
open register ships account for more than half the world's internationally
trading fleet and many OECD countries have relaxed or virtually abolished
crew nationality requirements, ships whose flags and entire crews share the
same nationality are mainly owned in the world's developing countries. These
same countries are also, for the most part, the suppliers of seafarers for the
ships of the open register and OECD countries' fleets. It is this movement of
seafarers between flags, created by the freedom of shipowners and managers
to choose combinations of different nationalities when assembling crews, that
allowed for a global labour market to be established.

###### The global labour market

At the beginning of the twentieth century, almost all ships were predominantly
crewed by nationals of the ship's flag     - a situation that continued into the 1970s.[1]

The global seafarer

###### Although this crewing practice was typically a legal requirement that varied in strength from country to country, it was also a matter of the practicalities of
organizing the recruitment of crews during a period in which the international
movement of people was costly and difficult. Some notable exceptions to the
employment of national crews arose as a result of the creation of the Panamanian
register in 1922 and the Liberian register in 1949, since neither of these countries
had internal seafarers' labour markets. However, the existence of these
anomalies posed few threats to the highly organized labour markets of the
embedded maritime nations in Europe and Japan until the prolonged recession
###### that hit world trade in the 1970s and 1980s.

The former pre-eminence of national crews and their concentration in
the ships of the embedded maritime nations can be seen in table 3.1. Although
###### three countries - France, Sweden and the United Kingdom - showed a slight
decline in the number of seafarers between 1935 and 1965, in all the other
###### countries the numbers rose, and in some cases considerably. Relevant data for
Japan are not readily available for the period, but the rapid rebuilding in the
1950s and 1960s of the Japanese fleet back to its pre-Second World War
###### position as one of the world's largest fleets suggests that the Japanese labour
force grew at a similar rate to those of Greece and Norway.

The employment data in table 3.2, although showing a long-term decline
of the seafaring labour force in OECD countries, contain two interesting
###### trends. The decline in the period 1968 to 1974 was largely a result of capital
intensification. The displacement of conventional geared cargo liners by
###### container ships, of 'tween decker tramps by big bulkers and of large tankers by
even larger ones saw a substantial growth in ship size but a fall in the number
of ships and crews. Big tankers had the same size crews as smaller ones, while
gearless bulkers and container ships both saw similarly substantial gains in
###### labour productivity as crew size declined both relatively and absolutely. Employment decline after 1974 was still due partly to productivity gains in all
sectors and especially in the container and bulk tramp trades, but by the 1980s
was almost entirely due to the phenomenon of flagging out by OECD
shipowners and the substitution of OECD seafarers by those from developing
###### countries and, later in the 1990s, by seafarers from Eastern Europe.

The pace and the scale of change in the 1980s in the composition of the
workforce generally and, consequently, in the nationality/ethnicity of crews, was
unprecedented. In 1987 alone, the employment of Filipino seafarers in
European-owned ships increased from 2,900 to 17,057 people. Translated into
crews, this meant that the number of European-owned ships with a substantial
Filipino component went from approximately 200 to 1,130 in just 12 months.
###### Almost all the displaced seafarers were domiciled in the embedded maritime
nations of Europe. Throughout the 1980s, the shipping industry press regularly

considerable. The figures released by Swedish shipowners in their attempts to
###### demonstrate to their Government their cost disadvantages can be taken as
reliable, even if some allowances should be made for exaggeration (figure 3.1).

The sudden switch to employing seafarers from non-established sources,
###### most of whom had not previously worked on ocean-going ships, entailed an
unavoidable reduction in standards of competence, except in those relatively
unusual cases where shipowners invested in training. Seafarers from south-east
Asia, and principally from Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and above all the
Philippines, were the newcomers to the world fleet. With the exception of India,
which had been providing crews for European ships on a large scale since the
middle of the nineteenth century, the new supply countries were very new indeed.
###### In the ILO's report to its second Asian Maritime Conference in 1965, Korean
seafarers received no mention whatsoever, although Indonesians and Filipinos
were reported as working on small inter-island ships. Small numbers of the latter
two nationalities had, in fact, worked on a few Dutch and American-owned ships
###### but not on a scale sufficient to provide the basis for a rapid and large expansion
into international shipping. A similar situation applied to Koreans: small numbers
domiciled in Japan had been sailing on Japanese ships for many years. And yet
by 1988 there were estimated to be 50,000 Korean seafarers, half of them working
aboard Japanese-owned ships flagged mainly in Panama. Only six years later, in
1994, and in a neat illustration of price sensitivities in the seafarers' labour market,

Korean shipowners were pressing their Government to be allowed to employ
Chinese seafarers, who could be paid half the Korean wage.

There are two recent estimates of the overall size of the world's labour force.
The BIMCO/ISF 2000 study estimates that the global labour force stands at 1.2
million people.[2] The 1997-2000 SIRC global labour market survey, based on a
sample of crew lists deposited by shipmasters with immigration control agencies
in various ports, estimates the figure to be 1.03 million seafarers.[3] The data in
figure 3.2 show a slight upward trend in the size of the at-sea labour force in cargo
ships     - from about 570,000 people in 1993 to 630,000 in 2000.[4] Figure 3.3 shows
the distribution of seafarers among the principal types of cargo-carrying ship.

The upward trend in employment of approximately 8,500 people per year
is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. As Chapter 1 shows the labour
intensive cruise sector is growing rapidly, so the demand for crews will inevitably
increase. Growth in the cargo sector is more modest but also seems set to
continue in line with world trade. There is no indication that ship size is likely to
rise sufficiently to produce any significant labour economies of scale. Cargo-
sector crewing levels are low but they have been fairly stable for almost a decade
and there is even some evidence of a slight increase (table 3.3). Further small rises
may result as the enforcement of safety standards becomes more effective and
more maintenance is done at sea. There are several financially successful tanker
owners     - Concordia is the best-known     - that run older ships with relatively large

crews of cruise ships. The average cargo ship crew in 2002 may be some 60 per
cent smaller than it was in 1970, but the organization of the crew into deck,
engine-room and catering departments has remained intact. General purpose
ratings' schemes with interchangeable deck and engine-room personnel have been
tried on a limited scale since the 1960s but have not been widely adopted. On
some ships, the catering crew might be required to turn out to assist the deck crew
on entering and leaving port, otherwise they cook and prepare food and clean
accommodation as before. Crew reductions were achieved not through radical
changes in the traditional division of labour but mainly by automation within
departments and large reductions in trainee ratings and officers. The grades of
boy deck and catering ratings have been virtually eliminated in OECD-owned
ships. The recruitment of officer trainees was substantially cut in the 1980s and
1990s, although in some OECD countries there have been attempts since the
late 1990s to revive officer training.

The age structure of the seafaring population has changed in parallel with
the shift of recruitment away from the older embedded maritime nations and
towards the newer seafarer supply nations of Asia and Eastern Europe. If it is
assumed that the age data for British seafarers in 1968 and 1998 (figures 3.4 and
3.5) was and is similar to that of other European OECD countries, then
###### interesting comparisons can be made with the age structure of seafarers from
countries such as China, the Philippines and Ukraine (figures 3.6 and 3.7).

These data on the age structure of seafarers from leading labour supply
countries are revealing. Firstly, the age distribution of British seafarers is
highly skewed to the older age groups. Secondly, and especially with regard to
officers, while the modal age group for Filipinos and Ukrainians is between 35
years and 44 years, for the Chinese the modal group is ten years younger.
These differences are largely a result of the rapid growth of the Chinese fleet
compared with the relative maturity of the Filipino and Ukrainian labour
forces. The comparative absence of younger people under the age of 25 may
be explained in part by the economic costs of labour market entry, which are
###### often personally incurred in many of the newer seafarer supply nations. The
fact that overall the labour force is older than it was in the 1960s is probably
of little consequence and may even be an advantage, since wastage rates are
commonly quite high among young seafarers.[5]

Crewing requirements in the cruise sector are completely different. As in
the hotel and catering industry on land, cruise shipping is labour intensive,
although only in respect of those crew members employed as "hotel" staff.
According to the 1997-2000 SIRC labour market survey, 84 per cent of crew
members are employed in passenger service roles in the cruise sector as a
whole. Cruise ship marine crews, though larger than those found aboard cargo
ships of similar tonnage, follow a similar organizational pattern: the

###### officer/rating ratio is at 40:60 in both sectors. There is, however, one quite
noticeable feature regarding cruise ship marine crews, namely that their
complements do not increase significantly with the size of ship and numbers
of passengers carried. Where the number of passengers to hotel crew is fairly
###### constant across the size range of ships, the number of marine crew per
passenger actually declines with the increase in ship size.

The data in figure 3.8 show that, although the number of hotel crew per
passenger remains almost constant irrespective of the size of the vessel, the
###### number of passengers per marine crew ranges from nine in the smaller ships to almost 24 in the larger vessels.

As seen in Chapter 1, the creation of the global labour market was the
###### unintended result of the cuts in labour costs made by shipowners and ship
managers in the embedded maritime nations of the OECD bloc. When, in the
1980s, these owners and managers ended their dependency on the established
and regulated labour markets of the nations in which their businesses were
sited, every world region able to offer cheaper seafaring labour immediately
became a potential source of supply. Thereafter, nationality became irrelevant
and employees were selected on the basis of a trade-off between price and the
quality of their training and accumulated experience. Of these characteristics,
the irrelevance of nationality is the most important. The freedom to assemble
crews of any nationality on one engagement and then to make completely
###### different choices of nationalities at subsequent engagements is the defining
feature of the global labour market for seafarers.

###### In principal, anyone with a good general knowledge of the industry and with
funds to invest in a maritime directory, a telephone, fax machine and a computer
###### with an Internet connection can take advantage of the global labour market's opportunities open to manning agents. However, firms that have large crewing
requirements and are able to afford personnel/crew management departments
###### with a global reach are in a position to benefit most from the situation. No doubt
this is why growing numbers of shipowners with relatively small fleets hire ship-
management companies to organize their crewing for them. The scale of the
crewing requirements of the larger ship-management companies and the range
of owners' crew preferences these companies have to satisfy inevitably lead ship
managers to use established networks of agencies in the labour supply countries.

Ship-management companies commonly have to guard against supplies of
labour drying up or the possibility of equally well-qualified but cheaper sources
of supply becoming available. It is for this reason that major employers with a
diversified "portfolio" of supply countries and agents routinely search for new
sources of seafaring labour and "experiment" with nationalities new to their ships.
In box 3.1, two senior managers of two extremely large ship-management
companies describe the labour market tours they undertook in 1994 and 2000.

The process of search and experimentation advertises the availability of
###### new sources and thus helps to shape a labour market which always carries within itself the seeds of instability. While the larger crew managers have the
resources to explore, sample and test new labour supply sources, and do so, at
any one moment their immediate needs are such that they are inevitably drawn
###### into at least semi-permanent organizational arrangements in a few of the labour supply nations. Crew managers with large labour requirements are, at
least in the short term, a significant force for labour market stability. It is
###### nonetheless true that ship managers also operate in competitive markets and it
is normal for them to let it be known, either by press releases or
advertisements, that they are able to supply attractively priced, cost-efficient
labour. The following sequence of announcements and advertisements taken
over a 13-year period illustrates the importance of ship managers in shaping
###### the labour market. In 1988, Barber International announced that it had
separately agreed with Portuguese and Korean Republic unions to provide
crews of 22 seafarers of each nationality for ships on the NIS at 40 per cent of
###### the price of a Norwegian crew.[6] Five years later, in 1993, the company said it
was pleased with the performance of its Polish crews, who were, in price terms,
"competitive with the Far East", and had set up, jointly with the Polish trade
###### union, Solidarity, a recruiting office in Szczecin.[7] Eight years later, in 2001, another of the larger ship-management firms, the Anglo-Eastern Group, announced that it could now offer "exciting new opportunities" by supplying
Chinese officers and ratings (box 3.2). As these examples show, single
###### nationality crews are being offered, although, as explained below, crews of this kind are only found aboard approximately one-third of ships trading
internationally.

###### Only in coastal shipping is the labour market relatively unorganized, in the sense that it is not dominated by crew managers and manning agents.
Particularly in the coastal tramp and feeder container trades, it is still possible
###### for individual seafarers to find jobs aboard ships for themselves. In ports such
as Piraeus and Rotterdam there are small clusters of domiciled Cape Verdeans,
East and West Africans, Egyptians, Filipinos, Indonesians, Latin Americans,
Poles, Portuguese, Russians and Turks who have lodged themselves in the
informal networks that find crews for small ships. Similar communities,
###### though composed of a different range of nationalities, can also be found in the
larger ports of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. But whether in Europe or
Asia, these are often precarious communities whose members may be residing
illegally. Intermediaries from within these communities historically played an
###### important role in linking shipowners with seafarers and still do so, but these
local brokers or "compradors" only bear a superficial resemblance to the
###### highly organized crew managers. As for the communities themselves,

although they may be no more than residues of the once large but transient
cosmopolitan waterfront districts of the world's larger ports, they do fill an
essential labour market role. Apart from providing a significant proportion of
crews for the smaller and hard-running ships working in coastal waters,
enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the island
archipelagos of south-east Asia, they can also supply the small numbers of
seafarers needed to make up the complements of deep-sea ships unexpectedly
obliged to land sick or injured crew members.

The global labour market, then, is a reality for most of the world's
seafarers except those working in the coastal and near-sea trades of either the
less developed countries of Asia or in those industrializing or developed
countries with cabotage policies, such as Brazil and the United States. There
are, of course, still a large number of internationally trading, nationally flagged
ships crewed by nationals, but, with the exception of China, none of these
fleets is large. It is a sign of the times that China, now the only nation with a
sizeable fleet of merchant ships crewed by nationals who have been trained and

ships. Elsewhere in the world, the national flag flown by a ship rarely
###### corresponds with the nationality of a significant proportion of the crew. The world's largest fleets are attached to either FOCs or second registers, and the
nationalities of these fleets' crews do not correspond with the flags of their
ships, as can be seen in tables 3.4 and 3.5.

This lack of correspondence between crew and the flag a ship flies is a
growing feature of flagged fleets as remaining nationality requirements are
steadily removed. Late in 2001, the prominent Taiwanese liner company,
Evergreen, began a process of reflagging a number of ships to the British flag.

based labour markets: ships announced their crewing requirements, and
seafarers either presented themselves for engagement or were presented
###### through intermediaries.

Preferences for particular nationalities and views about their "mixability"
are often influential in deciding the composition of crews. The SIRC global
###### labour market surveys of 1992-93 and 1997-2000 show that Russians and
nationals of the Republic of Korea are normally found only in single
###### nationality crews when engaged aboard FOC or second register ships. Where
Russians do sail in the company of other nationalities, they do so usually in
ones and twos rather than in homogeneous groups of officers or ratings. By
###### contrast, the surveys show that, although Filipino, Indian and Polish seafarers frequently provide large proportions of crews, they are less likely to form
whole crews in FOC or second register ships. English-language ability is
###### probably the decisive factor in most of these cases. Where standards of
English-speaking are relatively low, as they are widely held to be among
Russian and Korean seafarers, then it is presumably prudent to employ them
in monoglot crews. The English of Filipinos, Indians and Poles is generally
###### thought to be of a high enough standard for them to be placed with English-
speaking senior officers of other nationalities.

Nationalities also often seem to be chosen on the basis of what might be
called inter- and intraregional preferences. In some of these cases, preferences
seem to be a residue of historic imperial associations: it is noticeable that the only
groups of Indonesians and West Africans found in the sample aboard European
ships worked respectively in Dutch and British ships, and that the largest
employers of nationals of the Republic of Korea were the Japanese. Then there
are a number of cases of Egyptian officers and ratings sailing with Greeks in what
might be called a "Mediterranean association"; a "Baltic connection" might
account for Poles providing a high proportion of the crews of small German and
Norwegian ships; and a "south-east Asian connection" presumably explains the
predominance of Indonesians, Malaysians and Thais aboard Singaporean ships.
However, these nationality choices are more likely to be made on the basis of
availability and price than on sentiment or cultural familiarity.

A good illustration of the implicit structuring of nationality choice by
price can be seen in the crewing strategy of a European shipowner with a large

fleet of Panamanian-flagged container and ro-ro ships in long-distance trades.
Seven of this company's ships appeared in the SIRC 1992-93 survey, and in each
of them the officer corps consisted of Italian senior officers and Croatian junior
officers. The petty officers and ratings were likewise employed in a consistent
###### pattern of nationality and seniority, except that this part of the crew had a
triple-layered price structure. First and second were the "West" and "East"
European layers consisting of Italians and Croatians. Third was a developing
###### countries' layer, mainly made up of Malagasies or Western Samoans.

The mainstream nationality patterns revealed by the surveys are, of
course, only cross-sectional representations of a particular moment in time.
Earlier or later snapshots of the same owners' ships might well show different
ensembles of nationalities    - as in the case of a large products tanker owned by
one of the oil majors. In November, 1992, the ship had European officers and
was otherwise manned by Filipinos. By April, 1993, however, the ship had the
same officer composition but the Filipinos had been replaced by Sierra
Leoneans. Such changes of crew sources within fleets and over a period of time
are common, but this does not mean that owners and managers are constantly
switching between nationalities. The 1997-2000 SIRC survey found that the
oil major mentioned above was still employing Sierra Leonean seafarers six
years later. "Experimentation" may well have become the norm, but it does not
follow that the labour market is, at any given moment, so anarchic and
###### inconsistent that ships frequently sail with newly invented permutations of
crew nationalities. The labour market may be fluid, but it is not characterized
by large inflows and outflows over short periods of time. Were this the case,
the SIRC surveys would show a very much wider variety of crew compositions
than actually apparent.

Figure 3.9 shows the origins of seafarers by world region and rank. In
general, it is clear that the world shipping industry has become heavily dependent
on crews drawn from Eastern Europe, the Far East and South Asia, with these
three regions between them providing 81 per cent of the world's seafarers.

Figure 3.10 shows the national origins and ranks of seafarers from the ten
largest labour supply countries, and it is clear that neither of the two principal
shipping OECD countries    - Germany and Greece    - have enough junior
officers to replace their seniors. The countries with an equivalent or favourable
balance between junior and senior officers are China, India, the Philippines,
Romania, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, and it can, therefore, be
confidently predicted that citizens of these countries will, within the next
decade, be responsible for the day-to-day running of a very large proportion
of the world's ships. The impact of these developments will be felt most by
###### OECD shipowners, who will find it increasingly difficult to exercise their
current preferences for OECD senior officers.

As noted earlier, single nationality crews are now mostly confined to
ships owned in developing countries, where the employment costs of
seafarers are below those commonly found among internationally trading
ships. Although there are many single nationality crewed ships flying FOCs,
such as Malta and Panama, large numbers of these ships are owned in
countries such as China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Such is the
###### competition elsewhere among shipowners and ship managers for well-trained
and experienced crews that increasingly they often have little choice but to
assemble their crews from different nationalities. Although mixed nationality
crews do not seem to have been devised as a matter of conscious policy, there
is emerging evidence that, once owners/managers have accumulated
experience of them, they find them advantageous (see Chapter 4). Whatever
###### the reasons, the charts of figure 3.11a showing crewing patterns in six
principal ship types in 1999 illustrate the fact that crews combining three or
more nationalities have become extremely common: almost 50 per cent of oil
tankers and 40 per cent of chemical/gas tankers and container ships have
crews of this kind. As the labour market begins to stabilize and living
standards rise in countries such as China and Eastern Europe, smaller
###### countries from Africa and Latin America are likely to increase their labour
market contributions, thus ensuring that mixed nationality crews will
become the norm. Figure 3.1 lb clearly shows that the labour force is already
well advanced in this direction.

The organizational structure of the labour supply chain is straightforward.
Where shipowners or ship managers operate large fleets, overall manning
policies are decided at senior management level and then operationalized by in-
house personnel departments through their onward linkages with manning
agents and training institutions. For companies with a global reach and
operating technically sophisticated ships or less complex ones trading in niche
markets, crew recruitment and retention require a high level of investment.
Permanent staff need to be employed at both the "metropolitan" and the
"peripheral" ends of the business; in-house training programmes have to be run;
attractive employment contracts have to be offered to retain key personnel;
senior managers need to travel the world to monitor peripheral offices, agencies
and training institutions to ensure a flow of suitably qualified new recruits. Box
3.4 gives an indication of what this can involve.

###### In marked contrast to the systematically organized approach to recruitment taken by the larger shipping and ship-management countries are
the small agencies that recruit handfuls of people on a catch-as-catch-can basis.
The "labour market" does not normally have a literal, physical existence on any
scale. Seafarers' hostels and bars in the very large ports of the world are still
places where bodies and jobs are found but not in large numbers. However, in

Box 3.4 Barber pushes Polish solution to manning

By Rajesh Joshi, Oslo correspondent

Barber Group, the Kuala Lumpur-based ship-management arm of Norway's Wilhelm
Wilhelmsen, claims to have found the perfect solution for the crewing needs of cost-
and quality-conscious European shipowners: Polish seafarers, Poland's Solidarity
trade union and Barber are equal partners in Polish Manning Services, a Szczecin-
based joint venture headed by a Norwegian former master and staffed by
English-speaking personnel.

Barber claims to have developed a reliable hold over the market for Polish seafarers,
thanks to Solidarity's national standing, Barber's own operational and manning
expertise, and Polish Manning Services' close relationship with the Szczecin Maritime
University. About 600 Poles already serve as part of Barber's seafarer pool of 5,350
plus. About 170 cadets graduate annually from the Szczecin university, and Barber
currently claims to be training 20 cadets, ten each on the deck and engine side.

Poland has never enjoyed the recognition of countries such as the Philippines and
India when it comes to affordable seafarer supplies. Barber managing director Petter
Larsen in Oslo last week tried hard to rectify this anomaly. He felt Poland stood out as
a notable exception in the Baltic region, compared with countries such as Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania, which tended to be small, and Russia, which was seen as
somewhat complicated and requiring special effort and treatment. By contrast,
Barber's bullishness on Poland was based on the post-communism development of
the country itself. "Bureaucracy has been substantially cut. More and more Poles are
travelling internationally, and they have an excellent education system," Mr. Larsen
said. "Polish seafarers are physically strong and hardworking, which makes them
good matches for cold climates. They are always seen immaculately dressed, but
more importantly, they come out of the marine academy well-educated and well-
trained, and with a basic understanding of big shipping companies."

Mr. Larsen cited the high technical competence of the Poles as another strong factor.
The Szczecin university was said to have upgraded its technology, with radar
equipment to handle radar observer and automatic radar plotting aid requirements
being enhanced by the addition of engine and bridge simulators from Norway's
sophisticated Norcontrol. In addition, Polish Manning Services' office was said to
function with the aid of a computerized personnel system equipped for all stages,
from screening and selection through to crew rotation and client interface.

Mr. Larsen said proficiency in the English language was still a factor when it came to
dealings with the 45 plus age group, but was rapidly ceasing to matter among the
younger generation, thanks to travel and the popular media. "At a time when there is
a scarcity of good people, Poland is a simple solution," Mr. Larsen said. But Barber
claimed that the market's awareness of this solution was so limited that last year it was
actually forced to run advertisements in the Swedish press seeking suitable
employment for its qualified but idle Polish recruits.

Polish Manning Services coordinates twice-per-year officer seminars in Szczecin,
which are also an installed feature in the Barber Group's operations in India, Norway
and the Philippines. The latest such event was held in late November, providing
Barber's Polish officers with an opportunity to get updated on the latest
developments. In this context, Mr. Larsen identified safety and competence as
increasingly important factors in the future. He said that Barber's Polish hand was
strengthened by the fact that the Szczecin university's course section had IMO and
STCW courses, including courses in tanker safety, advanced firefighting and GMDSS.

Rizal Park in Manila, the Philippines, there is a daily street market, where
several hundreds of people assemble every day in the hope of finding work
(box 3.5).

Where the supply of labour greatly exceeds demand, as in the case of
ratings and dubiously qualified junior officers, would-be seafarers frequently
find there is a gatekeeper's fee payable in cash, services or in a combination of
###### the two. The costs of entry to the labour market incurred by seafarers vary
considerably between world regions. Most of the newly qualified seafarers from
Eastern Europe were originally trained by the State free of charge, which also
applied, in the main, to seafarers from the embedded maritime nations of
Europe and Japan. However, the same cannot be said for the new labour supply
nations of south and south-east Asia, where, at some stage in the process of
###### entry to the industry, expenses have been incurred by recruits and their families:
these can include the costs of training (often in private schools whose standards
may not be high), certification and an entrance fee, payable to the manning
agent. Of these gatekeeper payments, by far the most prevalent are the fees or
percentages paid to manning agents, long-standing practices that are proscribed
###### by ILO instruments.[8] Throughout south and south-east Asia and increasingly
in the Russian Federation, the former Soviet bloc nations of the Black Sea rim
and Ukraine, entry fees have similarly become routine. Both the existence and
###### the magnitude of the entry costs ensure that the neediest sections of the
different populations from the labour market are excluded. They also reflect the
high value placed on dollar-earning employment, at levels often impossible to
obtain in the indigenous labour markets.

Many agents, especially in Ukraine and other non-English-speaking
countries, employ English tests. A maximum age limit and minimum years of
service in hotels or restaurants (12 months in most cases) are set to ensure that
###### the industry gets a young, energetic and experienced workforce. Age
requirements for women are much stricter than those for men. In the

The labour market for seafarers

Box 3.5 Rizal Park, Manila: A daily "labour market"

Rizal Park, situated in the "crewing capital of the world", is the site of the world's
largest seafarers' labour market. Every day, hundreds of seafarers gather there,
lingering on the pavements by the park, looking for jobs. Shipowners, managers but
mostly manning agents may show up with jobs one day; on another day they may
make no appearance at all. Seafarers with various kinds of certificates/qualifications
and of various ages can be found here. Most, however, are poorly qualified seafarers
of low rank. Many of them are on the Government's watch list or manning agents'
black lists, chiefly because of their contact with international trade unions or because
they have made complaints about the working or living conditions aboard ship during
their employment at sea. There are also women here, although only in small numbers.
The women are looking for jobs in the hotel and catering departments of passenger
ships. They are young and well educated, with experience of working in hotels or
restaurants ashore. Many, however, are barred from entering the labour market by the
age limit set by manning agencies, although this doesn't stop them from roaming the
park every day. The age limits for cruise ships are set at 40 for men but just 29 for
women. To get to this labour market, many of the seafarers have taken long and
expensive flights from other islands. The lucky ones stay in Manila with friends or
relatives but most have to rent beds, often for months on end before finding
themselves a job.

Source: M. Zhao, Nov. 1999.

Philippines, for instance, the ceiling for men on cruise ships is 40 years old; for
women, it is 29. It is likely that the age requirements adopted in the West are
the same or similar.

The bigger and better regulated crewing agents in Asia and Eastern
Europe tend to have a steady pool of seafarers for their main clients or
principals (companies that subcontract ship managers). These seafarers are
trained or retrained before they sign on ships, and usually face no charges.
Many of the crewing agents are, however, small and less scrupulous. They
charge seafarers for the paper work they help process, for the training
provided and for the jobs to which they have been "introduced". According to
a study conducted in 1998 on seafarers employed in a major cruise company
based in Miami, in the Philippines it is typical for male and female seafarers to
pay an agency fee of 45,000 to 60,000 pesos ($1,200-1,500) to get a job aboard
cruise ships. The money is said to cover the return trip airfare with an open
###### return ticket, the seafarer's visa and the medical examination, all of which
comes to between $1,100 and $1,300. The rest goes to the agent. Bond money
is another device employed by some crewing agents to ensure that the
seafarers employed through their service complete the contract to the full
satisfaction of the cruise company. There are also cases in which seafarers have

79


-----

been cheated of their money by flying agents, that is, agents who collect fees
from seafarers and then disappear without having provided any kind of
service.[9]

The rapidly growing cruise sector, which now employs women in up to
30 per cent of ships' complements, engages female crew members according to
###### their national origins. Western women mainly rely on advertisements to find
jobs with cruise lines, and only a few are recruited through word of mouth
from friends or relatives. In the United Kingdom, for example, the crewing
agent's main role is to collect information on job vacancies in the industry and
###### then to sell it in the form of booklets or newsletters to applicants. They do not
usually provide training or even conduct interviews with applicants. Their
###### contact with the potential seafarer is primarily by telephone, fax, e-mail or
post. Except for the cost of the information they provide, they do not charge
individual seafarers for the jobs they help them to find.

The recruitment procedures and training that Asian women have to
undergo are significantly different. First of all, they mostly depend on friends
and relatives for information and rely heavily on crewing agents not only for
###### recruitment but also for training, which is a thriving business in many Asian
countries. Indeed, a recent study found that all cruise companies use crewing
agents to recruit their staff and 74 per cent of the companies surveyed use
exclusive manning agents, that is, agents who work exclusively for certain
cruise lines.[1][0]

Overall, the participation rate of women in seafaring remains low:[11]

according to 1992 IMO data,[12] women represent between only 1 to 2 per cent
of the world's 1.25 million seafarers, most of whom come from OECD
countries. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, this estimate still
seems valid, even though the female participation rates in the seagoing
workforce vary greatly by region, country, company and sector. By far the
largest numbers of women, both absolutely and proportionately, are found in
###### the hotel staffs of the cruise sector.

Among a group of eight European countries (Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom), the
average proportion of women in the total seafaring workforce between 1997
and 2001 was found to be 9.15 per cent, although the relatively high number
of Swedish and Danish women and the very low number of Italian women
seafarers seriously distort this average.[1][3]

In other parts of the world, women's representation in the seafaring
###### workforce also varies greatly from country to country. For example, their
share of the workforce is 5 per cent in Indonesia and Latvia, about 3 per cent
in Australia and 0.5 per cent in New Zealand.[1][4] In 1998, India reported that the
###### country had 43,000 registered seafarers, of whom only three were women.[1][5]

The labour market for seafarers

In the Philippines, the largest supplier of seafarers to the world merchant fleet,
only 225 women out of 230,000 seafarers appear on the national seafarers'
register for 1983-90,[16] while in Brazil, there are 1,279 women seafarers out of
a total of 119,835, that is, 1.1 per cent of the workforce.[1][7]

###### Training and certification

The drop in the number of officer trainees is acknowledged to be a serious
problem. The BIMCO and the ISF have been publicizing this shortfall
###### through a series of reports commissioned by the Institute of Employment
Research (1ER) at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom. Officer
trade unions in OECD countries have been campaigning for greater state
involvement in officer training, with some effect. The Governments of the
###### Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom have all introduced supportive
measures and the European Commission is aiming to build a system of
integrated national strategies.[1][8]

In an early evaluation of the economics of flagging out, G. N.
Yannopoulos argued:

The more difficult it is for native skilled seamen from embedded maritime
countries to flag themselves out, the greater will be the reliance on unskilled labour
from other countries. Because of this difference in the quality of labour employed
in the two market sectors, the efficiency of shipping operators in the FOC sector
will be lower          - other things being equal.[19]

Five years later, in 1993, when the managers of the Standard Steamship
###### Owners' Protection and Indemnity Association (the Standard P&I Club) were,
in their own words, assessing "the causes of the claims explosion since 1987",
their internal memorandum, "Minimum Standards", spoke of "demoralized and
unqualified casual crews with little or no loyalty to their employers". They also
###### noted that a "shortage of qualified crews is only too well known and it is our
experience that a high percentage of personal injury claims are caused by fairly
serious negligence. [...] One cannot any longer rely on paper qualifications of
crew members without giving them additional training."[20]

The training, education and certification of seafarers have become
increasingly prominent issues, largely in response to concerns among industry
professionals of levels of crew competence. A spate of reports from
###### underwriters, the Salvage Association, shipmasters and maritime
administrators in different parts of the world from the mid-1980s onwards
have all questioned the adequacy of the new world regime of maritime
education and training (MET). Confidence was not enhanced when the
maritime authority of one important new supplier of seafarers stated, in 1990,

81


-----

The global seafarer

###### that approximately 50 per cent of Indonesian seafarers had received no formal
training. And in the same year, one of the oil majors said that from
###### henceforward it would be expecting chartered shipowners to commit
themselves to proper training programmes for staff and crew and to have a
clear policy regarding navigation and watchkeeping. A year later, in 1991, the
maritime authorities of the then territory of Hong Kong refused to recognize
Philippine licences for employment on Hong Kong-registered ships. The ban
was lifted once it had been shown that measures had been taken to address
###### corruption in the Philippine examination system (box 3.6).

These issues were brought to a head in 1993 when Andreas Ugland, then
chairperson of Intertanko, complained of the wide variation in standards
required for certificates of competency, ranging from high to dangerously low.
###### He called for higher requirements in Standards of Training, Certification and
Watchkeeping (STCW) certification, greater policing of standards by flag
States, better MET and PSC inspections to ensure STCW compliance. The
result of the very public airing of these issues, which for long had been the talk
###### of everyday discussion, resulted in the substantial revision of the STCW Convention of 1978 in 1995 (STCW-95), which aims to retrieve the training
standards lost in the 1980s. The move offshore in that decade not only led to
###### the recruitment of large numbers of inexperienced crew members, it also resulted in a substantial decline in MET in the embedded maritime nations and
a growing reliance on the under-resourced, inexperienced and poorly regulated

Box 3.6 Corruption in Philippine maritime training schools

A dramatic fall in the pass rates recorded by the Philippines' maritime training schools
has followed a thorough overhaul of the previously corrupt system of examination. [...]
Pass rates as high as 100 per cent were being regularly recorded in the early 1980s
by some of the 70-odd schools and, although the rates dropped to a more realistic
40-50 per cent in 1986, by the late 1980s they were once again in the 90 per cent and
above range. Cheating, bribing and fixing in the exams were endemic. [...] It was well
known for some time, both in and outside the Philippines, that licences could be
bought, but the biggest impetus for change came in 1991 when the Hong Kong
authorities refused to recognize Philippine licences for employment on Hong Kong-
registered ships. [...] Elaborate security measures [introduced in 1992] resulted
immediately in the overall pass rate falling to 15 per cent. In May last year the pass
rates for master mariners were 12 per cent, chief mates 17 per cent, second mates
11 per cent and third mates 3 per cent. Foreign employers of Filipino seamen are still
concerned, however, that the exams, although now "tamper-proof and leak-proof",
are still of a generally low standard.

MET colleges found in some of the new labour supply countries. The initial
gap in relative standards between the "old" and the "new" sources of seafarers
was inevitably large. By 1999, after a period of almost 20 years, the training
quality gap had narrowed. Standards advanced most in the more rapidly
developing regions and nations of south-east Asia, such as Taiwan (China),
and the Republic of Korea, but, and with some irony, they are each taking the
###### path already followed by Hong Kong (China) and Singapore. The latter two,
although sites of excellent training standards, have long ceased to be
significant suppliers of seafarers. Whereas in 1964, Hong Kong had some
45,000 seafarers, this had declined to 2,088 in 1992, even though Hong Kong
owned and managed a fleet of 1,233 ships. For its part, Singapore, with one of
the world's largest and most modern fleets, relies almost wholly on Filipinos,
Indians, Indonesians, Malaysians and Myanmar nationals to crew its ships.
Singaporeans account for less than three per cent of those employed aboard
the national flag fleet.

Both the ISF and the ITF made considerable contributions to the shaping
of the revised STCW Convention and were active participants in the sessions
of the IMO/ILO Joint Committee on Training. Although the globalization of
the labour market had made a new international Convention on labour
certification standards a necessity, implementation presented the IMO with an
###### unprecedented regulatory task. All maritime administrations that license
seafarers were asked by the IMO to submit their specifications regarding
###### institutional and procedural arrangements. This validating procedure delivered
what became known as the "white list": a register of administrations deemed
###### to be in compliance with IMO requirements (although it fails to pass
judgement on the quality of institutional provision, nor does it include
detailed curricula specifications). With the STCW-95 Convention, the global
shipping industry now has a clear set of requirements for the types of
###### certificates that seafarers need and the procedures that maritime
administrations must carry out. There remain, however, often substantial
variations in the standards of supervision, curricula content, the overall quality
of training institutions and the extent of fraudulent certification. The potential
significance of the latter is revealed in box 3.7, in which a PSC inspector
recounts an incident that took place in the Persian Gulf in the early 1990s.

The question of the degree to which ships might be sailing without a
###### proper complement of qualified staff has recently become a policy issue. In
1999, the IMO commissioned research to be carried out into fraudulent
certification and the ISF proposed measures to enable Internet checks to be
made on the validity of certification. The IMO study, which was reported in
2001, found that the highest number of incidences of fraudulent practice
occurred in south and south-east Asia and that there was also cause for

Box 3.7 A cautionary tale

Whilst working in the Persian Gulf a few years ago, I boarded an 11,000 dwt dry cargo
vessel to carry out an inspection. The ship had loaded cargo in Italy and had arrived
via the Suez Canal and a few ports in the Gulf. Documentation on board indicated that
the crew list as presented to us was the same as it had been while loading in Italy.
Deciding to check the documentation further, the master was asked to produce the
officers' certificates of competency. This request produced much shuffling of feet and
urgent undertones in Arabic. In the end the master produced one certificate         - his own.
This document appeared to be a 2nd mate's certificate, was printed in English and
had been issued by the harbour master's office of a Middle Eastern port some four
weeks previously. It was endorsed on the obverse side to the effect that it had been
"issued without examination". There were no other certificates of any description on
board. No master, mate, second mate, chief or 2nd engineer and, above all, no radio
officer, nor anyone on board with any knowledge whatever of how to operate anything
except the VHP set on the bridge. In this state, the vessel had been passed by PSC
in Italy and had somehow passed through the Suez Canal.

It was decided immediately that the vessel should be detained pending contact
through official channels with the maritime authority who had registered the ship and
its owners. They were told that the vessel would be detained until such time as they
supplied the vessel with a properly certificated officer complement. An extraordinary
telex reply was received back along the lines to the effect that the registering
authorities, after consultation with the owners, considered that the vessel was
adequately manned according to their standards and they demanded the vessel's
release. This demand was naturally not complied with and they were told yet again
that the vessel would continue to sit in port until they supplied the requisite
complement.

Eventually, about two weeks after the date of the original detention, six Greek officers
arrived by air, all properly certificated (in particular, we had the radio officer's certificate
checked out by a Greek national) and the vessel was finally passed and released. Its
progress down the Gulf en route to the Far East was followed by our port radio station
with interest. And at a rendezvous point somewhere off Dubai a boat came out and
took all six Greek officers off for repatriation. They were not replaced. Thus the vessel
continued on its way with the original rogue complement.

###### istration officials, examiners, training establishments and employers), which
allowed fraud to pass undetected, as a main cause of fraudulent practice as well
as forgeries of various kinds.

###### In the IMO survey, 17 per cent said that they had sailed with people they
knew to be holding fraudulently obtained certificates and that, of this group,

84

nine out of ten said that they themselves held fraudulent certificates. The
general nature of the problem can be seen in the following excerpt taken from
a report by the IMO's study team on field research carried out in one of the
major labour supply countries, where it was estimated that between 15,000 and
20,000 fraudulent basic safety training certificates were being issued each year:

The substantial increase over the past few years in the number of private training
establishments offering short STCW courses has resulted in the administration

[of this country] being unable to maintain effective control of the standards of
every single training establishment. Reliable sources within the administration
informed the research team that about 20 of these private training institutes issue
certificates for safety-related courses without offering any training. [...] Officials
within the administration who are genuinely concerned about this situation have
reported it to higher authorities. However, their efforts are constrained due to the
political patronage enjoyed by some of the owners of these institutes.

There was evidence to indicate that some manning agents have good contacts with
sub-standard institutes and, in fact, some of these are owned [...] by manning
agencies. Prospective job seekers who approach these agencies are routinely asked
to undergo short STCW courses [...] or are provided with [...] certificates
without undergoing any training. One of the researchers was offered, by a manning
agent, all basic safety training certificates for the equivalent of $300.[22]

There are, as yet, no data compilations of the world's MET institutions
in the public domain, although the IMO will be in a position to publish this
###### information when it has received and processed the applications for IMO
inclusion on its "white list" of institutions in compliance with STCW-95.
However, even though no precise data are available, the trends in MET are well
known. The number and range of training establishments in the embedded
maritime nations fell substantially in the 1980s and 1990s, while there was
considerable growth in south and south-east Asia and, probably, stability or
only modest decline in Eastern Europe. The shift of MET from the relatively
prosperous northern hemisphere to the less prosperous southern hemisphere
has inevitably led to an overall decline in standards.

The developments in the embedded maritime nations of the 1960s and
1970s that aimed to create a highly skilled and professional seafaring
workforce at all levels of the shipboard division of labour underwent a steady
process of attrition in the face of a collapse of demand for places. Many
colleges closed, especially those specializing in training rankings, and now
###### there are also fewer colleges specializing in officer training - those that do have
become increasingly dependent on foreign students. For some years, the
###### number of foreign students enrolled in Australian, British and Irish colleges
have greatly exceeded those of home students. Indeed, but for the foreign

85


-----

demand for places, more of these officer-training colleges would also have
closed. In more recent years, there have been concerted attempts in the
###### Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom to arrest the decline in the
training of own-nationals, and it is plausible to suggest that there will be an
###### upturn in demand for training places in the embedded maritime nations, at
least in Europe. There has been some convergence in wage rates between
Europe and the new labour countries, and rising PSC expectations in respect
of standards of competence are likely to lead to some rebuilding of the
European officer corps. Although European training standards in the 1990s
were maintained, further increments would signal a renewed commitment to
professionalism and have a knock-on effect in the new labour supply
countries, where in some cases there is an urgent need for upgrading.

Recent research commissioned by the EU and coordinated by the World
Maritime University (WMU) and the SIRC produced an objective account of
###### training provision and standards in China, India, Indonesia and the
Philippines.[23] Unsurprisingly, the research reported that, in general, funding
levels are insufficient to match the general level of standards found in the
embedded maritime nations. Relatively speaking, these are poor countries and
###### they cannot be expected to provide sophisticated equipment for maritime
colleges to train people to work in offshore labour markets. The research does,
nevertheless, report high overall training standards in China and India. The
###### situation in Indonesia and the Philippines is very different: most of the training provision comes from private institutions, which are typically
inadequately equipped and staffed by people who are poorly qualified, both
formally and experientially. Outside the personnel departments of the ship-
management companies recruiting seafarers, there is little recent knowledge of
###### current standards in Eastern Europe. The Polish and Baltic States' systems are
widely held in high regard and the colleges in Bulgaria, Romania, the Russian
###### Federation and Ukraine also seem to have maintained their high standards.

The shipping industry has never considered it necessary to make any
substantial investment in non-officer training except for a brief ten-year
###### period from the late 1960s. However, as trading conditions improved and
regulatory requirements increased during the 1990s, there is some evidence of
a renewed interest in crewing ships from top to bottom with well-trained
multi-skilled professionals. The United Kingdom's Chamber of Shipping, for
example, has been expressing views of this kind and similar expressions have
been heard in the Netherlands and Norway. The possibilities of transferring
the more routine tasks of officers to ratings and upgrading maintenance to
ships at sea have often been recognized and, as noted above, some shipowners
have taken steps towards doing so. However, the consequences of such
changes have been inhibited by the lack of sufficiently skilled ratings and

86

The labour market for seafarers

###### uncertainty as to whether the additional cost outlays can be justified given
normal cost-accounting time horizons. On an operational level, the shipping
company Concordia managed to realize profits while running ULCCs and
VLCCs with crew complements almost double those of the industry norm.
However, there is little information on the availability of sufficiently qualified
ratings. The BIMCO/ISF labour market studies have consistently highlighted
the shortages of well-trained officers and successfully raised awareness of the
problem. The most recent of these studies has suggested that the recorded
surplus of available ratings might be more apparent than real. An SIRC study
on the training and certification of ratings stated:

While there may be little reason to doubt that the number of persons offering
themselves for employment as ratings is in excess of the available number of
jobs, there are on the other hand genuine reasons for doubting whether all those
offering themselves for employment are suitable for employment in terms of
training and experience. These doubts are sustained by the following
considerations:

            - Substantial variations in the quality of pre-sea and post experience training
provision in different countries make it difficult to define "suitability for
employment". The problem is compounded by the lack of a universal
definition of skills needed by ratings.

            - Minimalist manning practices severely curtail the possibilities of on-the-
job training and therefore raise questions as to the quality of experiential
training.

            - The prevalence of fraudulent certification practices at rating levels
suggests that many new entrants have had no prior preparation for life and
work aboard ship and that watchkeeping certificates have often been
issued improperly.

            - The lack of adequate labour market data on manning levels in different
ship types, on recruitment, on duration of seagoing careers, on educational
backgrounds, on age profiles, on the duration of the voyage-leave cycle.[24]

There is no logistically realistic way of determining whether there are
sufficient numbers of suitably trained and experienced ratings to crew the
world's ships. Appropriate levels of skills and the knowledge ratings need never
have been the subject of investigation or codification. The industry has always
worked on the assumption that the work done by ratings was best learned on
the job and that this would involve new recruits working at the shoulder of
experienced shipmates. This approach seems to have worked well when ships
had relatively large crews and boy ratings' ranks were an established part of

87

ships' complements. However, given today's minimum crewing levels, there
would not seem to be enough time for on-board training, even if young ratings'
ranks were to be reinstated. Meanwhile, although cadet training programmes
###### that mix college and seagoing periods have become an almost universal aspect
of officer training, similar schemes for ratings are rarely found. The SIRC study
on ratings found that, of the training schemes examined in 15 countries and
evaluated on 12 criteria, only three countries (Denmark, Romania and Ukraine)
satisfied more than half the procedural criteria.[25]

###### Trade unions and collective bargaining

The existence of well-organized trade unions and national collective bargaining
###### institutions lay at the heart of the labour market regulatory systems of the
embedded maritime nations. The rapid decline since the 1970s of the fleets of
###### these countries has, naturally, been accompanied by declining union
membership. Trade union influence, however, has remained significant,
especially in Australia, Europe, Japan and the United States, where unions have
###### continued to play an important political role in the development of policies
aimed at squeezing out sub-standard shipping. Informal and mostly tacit
alliances with shipowners, insurers, classification societies and the P&I Clubs
significantly contributed to the establishment of effective PSC measures and
organizations in the 1990s. The institution of PSC itself may have had little
effect on the employment possibilities for seafarers in the embedded maritime
nations but it has unquestionably made a major contribution and added to the
impetus of the process towards regulating the global labour market.

The trade unions, and the Norwegian trade unions in particular, have also
been influential in setting wage rates. Critical to the creation of the NIS in
1987 was the support given to Norwegian shipowners by the country's unions.
Part of the quid pro quo for this support was the involvement of the
###### Norwegian unions in setting wage rates and ensuring collective bargaining
agreements for foreign seafarers (principally Indian and Filipino) working
aboard NIS ships. Because the NIS flag grew so rapidly and employment
###### contracts were subject to some regulation under this flag, thanks to
Norwegian trade union influence, Norwegian shipowners rapidly set best
practice standards in the Philippines. The impact of this on the Filipino labour
###### market was almost instantaneous: European shipowner employment of
Filipino seafarers increased by 83 per cent in 1986-87.

More recently, some of the Danish trade unions have established a similar
###### transnational bargaining role with Danish shipowners concerning DIS crews, although this possibility was not open to British trade unions and the Red
Ensign Group: the United Kingdom's national collective bargaining machinery,

88


-----

The labour market for seafarers

the National Maritime Board, was dismantled in the mid-1980s. The United
Kingdom's ships' officers' union, the National Union of Marine Aviation and
Shipping Transport Officers (NUMAST), has company agreements and, now
###### that the union recruits seafarers employed aboard British-flagged ships
regardless of their nationality, it follows that non-nationals have been integrated
###### into the United Kingdom's collective bargaining arrangements. The German transport union, Verdi, claims negotiation rights for all seafarers working
aboard German second register ships.

The influence of the Norwegian seafarers' trade unions on ship-
management company practice has, in general, also been important. Where
###### Norwegian ship-management companies, such as Barber International,
commonly have collective bargaining agreements in labour supply countries,
others have been obliged to follow in their attempts to attract similarly well-
trained seafarers. By 1993, for example, Barber had established an agency in
Poland in cooperation with Solidarity. However, not all ship-management
companies are keen on union involvement. When BP Tankers flagged out its
fleet to Bermuda and the Isle of Man and awarded crew-management contracts
###### to Wallems, Acomarit and the Schulte subsidiary, Dorchester Maritime, in
1986, all three companies refused to set up negotiating rights with NUMAST.

Among the labour supply countries of Asia, India was the only nation to
have well-established trade unions, which, like those in Europe and Japan, were
also active participants in an intricate tripartite regulatory system. Until the 1970s,
much of the Indian union's membership worked aboard British-, Danish- and
Norwegian-flagged ships, although since the 1950s growing numbers have been
employed in the new state-owned shipping companies. The seafarers' unions of
the Philippines and the Republic of Korea only became firmly established when
their countries became large suppliers of labour in the 1980s.

The extent to which the trade unions of the labour supply countries are
directly involved in collective bargaining machinery at the level of detail
typical of the embedded maritime nations is not clear. At least in some cases     -
and perhaps in many     - the presence of collective bargaining arrangements does
###### not extend much beyond the union signifying its agreement to the terms of
the employment contract. These agreements are not normally rooted in any
###### permanent or standing procedures capable of dealing with disputes or
grievances as they arise or at appropriate moments. Shipboard representational
schemes are extremely rare. The ISMA's Code of Shipmanagement Standards
does require "procedures for dealing with complaints and/or grievances from
or about personnel" but makes no reference to trade union representation,
although this does not, of course, preclude the possibility of such machinery
nevertheless being provided for. The likelihood of disputes, grievances and so
on being dealt with at ports of call by trade union organizations is also low.

89


-----

The global seafarer

The trade unions of the new labour supply countries do not usually have
agency arrangements with foreign trade unions. Even the more experienced
and organizationally efficient trade unions of the embedded maritime nations
were never enthusiastic about ceding representational services to other unions,
except in emergencies. Furthermore, rapid turnaround times, out-of-the-way
###### port locations and finding someone with the personal skills to register
complaints effectively all place severe restrictions on trade union involvement
during the period of engagement aboard ship.

###### Although there is enough information in the public domain to show the continuing importance of trade unions and collective bargaining, there are no
data series listing seafarers' trade unions and their memberships on a world
regional or global basis. Neither are there any regular surveys of the extent of
collective bargaining. The best available indication of the scale of trade unions
can be gleaned by looking at the number of trade unions affiliated to the ITF.
In 1999, there were 235 unions from 97 countries with a total declared
membership of 660,059, representing approximately 66 per cent of the global
workforce. Apart from the absence of the state-controlled trade unions of
China, most of the world's eligible organizations are ITF-affiliates.

Between 1994 and 1998, the number of affiliated unions increased by 10
###### per cent although their combined membership fell by 9 per cent. This tends to
suggest a diminution in the size of national maritime unions, a phenomenon
###### that is most apparent in the traditional maritime nations. The ITF also
maintains an inspectorate consisting of 105 inspectors in 39 countries. In
1998, 6,187 inspections were carried out, 87 per cent of which were on FOC
vessels. The purposes of these inspections are essentially twofold: firstly, to
ensure that if a ship has an ITF agreement, it is adhered to; and secondly to
###### attempt to secure an ITF agreement where no other agreements governing a
crew's conditions of service are in place.

The ITF is formally a trade secretariat like all the other trade union
internationals. That is to say and using the supply chain analogy, it is a hub for
receiving and passing on information to and from its affiliated unions. Because
the structure of the modern shipping industry makes it impossible for
nationally based unions working independently to have a significant impact on
###### their members' employment situation, the ITF has, through its "Special
Seafarers' Department" (SSD), become an international trade union in its own
right. The SSD also coordinates the industrial side of the ITF's FOC
campaign. SSD membership is open to all seafarers who sail on FOC vessels
or "other such ships as the FPC [Fair Practices Committee] may decide".[26] In
1996, SSD membership numbered about 10,000.

The ITF has developed an intricate set of arrangements and customary
practices allowing it to function globally but in the traditional manner of trade

The labour market for seafarers

unionism. On the one hand, it aims to regulate the everyday terms and
conditions of employment between employers and employees. To this end, it
focuses its efforts on the FOC and other offshore fleets. By both constitution
and convention, it makes no attempt to regulate national flag fleets, except in
circumstances where "local" practices undermine global objectives. On the
###### other hand, the ITF also attempts to secure legislation in those employment
matters that are beyond the reach of standard collective bargaining. Through
its membership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
###### (ICFTU), the ITF seeks to establish working partnerships with other
shipping industry constituencies to create laws and Conventions on matters of
health and safety, training and education and so on, all of which contribute to
the well-being of seafarers. The industry has the equivalent of a minimum
wage, which is periodically negotiated between employers and unions under
the aegis of the ILO (see Chapter 4). In a new and significant departure, in
2000, the ITF and the International Maritime Employers' Committee (IMEC)
set up permanent collective bargaining machinery and marked it with an
agreement on ITF benchmark wages and hours of work for ships on ITF Blue
Card agreements.

The ITF has a well-codified policy on FOCs, which has, however, seen
various changes since its inception in 1948. Although the ITF has maintained
an underlying principle that seeks the reflagging of all FOC vessels to their
national flag of beneficial ownership, such policy is now constrained by more
pragmatic considerations relating to the effective regulation of the FOC fleet.
Therefore, the ITF has, in recent years, been seeking to raise the effectiveness
of its FOC campaign by adopting a more robust approach to industrial action
against sub-standard ships, while at the same time aiming to enter into a
dialogue with all those in the industry concerned with eliminating exploitation
and raising standards.[27]

###### The ITF also has an Actions Department and an Agreements Department. The former unit takes action against vessels that have been the
object of complaints from crew members or other interested parties. In 1998,
the causes of complaints were: non-payment of wages (56 per cent of cases);
sub-standard ships and/or living conditions (15 per cent); abandonment (12
###### per cent); non-compliance with collective agreements (12 per cent); and "other" cases, including victimization, unfair dismissal, problems with medical treatment, and overtime and delayed allotment issues (5 per cent). FOCs
feature among the worst offenders: 75 per cent of crew complaints concerned
###### FOC-flagged vessels (table 3.6).

There are a number of problems that typify trade union activity and
collective bargaining in the maritime industry. First, trade unions find it
difficult to organize workers because eligibility for membership often

commences when a voyage begins, and ends at the termination of that voyage.
Second, there is competition in some of the labour supply nations between
###### strong trade unions and more compliant ones. The ITF recognizes that its current rules on representation rights can be used by some unions merely as a
means to secure membership and, thus, revenue. Accordingly, the ITF
published, in 1997, its Seafarers' Charter, which sets out the responsibilities of
its affiliates. Third, the employment contract is often made, or mediated,
between the seafarer and a crewing agency, rather than with the shipowner
directly. This again tends to weaken the ties between worker and union. Such
practices are particularly prevalent among FOC crews.

The ITF's rules on union representation rights do not, in themselves,
make for a perfectly clear collective bargaining structure. According to these
rules, trade unions in the country of beneficial ownership have the right to

92


-----

The labour market for seafarers

conclude agreements covering vessels beneficially owned in those countries. In
cases where the beneficial ownership is not easy to determine, the trade union
in the country where effective control is exercised has negotiating rights,
including the right to transfer those rights to the labour supply trade union.[28]

In effect, such rules have introduced the concept of the internationalization of
trade union membership, albeit in an incoherent fashion.

There has also been some increasing polarization between unions
representing officers and those representing ratings, although too much
should not be made of this. On certain issues, the unions of ratings and
officers inevitably have conflicting interests, although in many countries
officers and ratings are members of the same union. Nevertheless, it is true
that, while officers' unions have seen the skills of their members in great
demand during a period of worldwide shortage, the opposite has been the case
for ratings' unions in OECD countries, where there has been downwards
pressure on jobs and wages.

###### It would seem that the collective bargaining power of unions could be
enhanced if the relevant Conventions of the ILO were to be accorded the same
weight as those concerned with safety and pollution, for example. In
particular, on the subject of sustainable employment it would be useful if the
provisions of the Continuity of Employment (Seafarers) Convention, 1976
(No. 145), could be inserted into the rubric of the Merchant Shipping
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1976 [and Protocol, 1996] (No. 147), at
the earliest opportunity. Such a move would give more stability to the
employment structure of the maritime industry as it would enhance the
bargaining power of national maritime unions.

Notes

1 For most of this period, the United Kingdom had the world's largest shipping industry, with up to one-third of its
seafarers recruited from British Somaliland, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, West Africa, the West Indies and the Yemen.
All these seafarers had British nationality until their countries became independent, at which point they became
Commonwealth citizens. Comparable arrangements applied to citizens of the former French and Dutch empires.

 SHIPBOARD LIFE

 AND WORK-I

A Maldivian at work

###### Shipboard society

 In 1979, S. Roger, a well-known American journalist specializing in labour
relations, stood on a quayside with two colleagues, waiting to join the
###### Norwegian ship Hoegh Mallard. Roger's mission was to sail with the ship for
a period of seven weeks and to consider the impact on crew members of
technological and social organizational change. As Roger commented:
###### "Here on the Mallard we might catch a glimpse of the future of not only
maritime shipping, with the evolution of all-purpose seamen, but what might
happen in any workplace."[1]

In consultation with Oslo University's Work Research Institute,
###### Hoegh Lines had been experimenting with life aboard its vessels and had introduced a number of practices contrasting strongly with prevailing conditions aboard American merchant ships. Whole crew dining and recreation were the norm, ships were provided with excellent recreational
facilities (the Mallard had an indoor swimming pool, among other things)
and the labour force was encouraged to upskill and increase its flexibility in
terms of work roles. As regards the latter, ratings were given more
###### responsibility for their own work and were said to hold the view that they
had "become their own bosuns",[2] and the divide between deck and
engine was diminished. There was also an expectation that rigid ships'
hierarchies would be eroded as more democratic forms of management were
###### introduced:

95


-----

The global seafarer

On this trip we expected to be engaged with basic and central workplace issues:
the involvement of the worker in decisions about how work was to be organized
and carried out, the levelling of a once-rigid and authoritarian hierarchy, the effort
to create a more humane and responsive environment within an insulated
shipboard culture, and the training of an all-purpose seaman, as much at home on
land as at sea.[3]

More than 20 years later, in a new century, hardly any of this vision of the
###### future has materialized in the international merchant marine. Inevitably, the industry has seen some changes, including a reduction in the size of crews.
However, the radical changes introduced aboard the Mallard have not been
noticeably taken up elsewhere. Hierarchies still persist aboard almost all
vessels and the divisions of labour between deck and engine crews have
generally been maintained. Ships retain a recognizably institutionalized form,
accurately reflecting the descriptions and analyses of some of the first social
scientists to look at shipboard societies.[4] Social isolation remains a prominent
feature of seafarers' lives, even if they concurrently suffer from time to time
from a kind of claustrophobia resulting from being confined with their
shipmates. It is a strand of continuity that links the lives of the very earliest
seafarers with their contemporaries, as Paulo Perez-Mallaina acknowledged in
his description of sixteenth-century Spanish mariners:

A sailor could feel himself separated from the world and at the same time physically
crushed by the presence of his comrades; and he could watch thousands of
landscapes pass before his eyes and scarcely have occasion to experience any of
them. These circumstances constituted, and still constitute today, the character and
the burden of a life at sea.[5]

Alongside such consistencies in on-board living and working conditions,
however, there have also been significant social changes. These include the
large-scale introduction of multinational crews, a revolution in information
and communication technologies, and faster ship turnaround in ports.

The sixteenth-century Spanish mariners described by Perez-Mallaina
were accustomed to sailing with their own compatriots in single nationality
crews. However, many sectors of the merchant marine have used multi-
###### national crews for a long time now. Even where nineteenth-century ships set
sail with single nationality complements, crew members that became sick or
###### injured, who died or who simply signed off, were frequently replaced with whomever was available in foreign ports, regardless of nationality. Nevertheless, despite the prevalence of polyglot crews in international
shipping since the fifteenth century, Chapter 3 showed that it is only since
###### the 1980s that modern-day practices of international recruitment came to be formalized on a world scale.

###### Just as technological innovation has not had the radical impact on the
shipboard division of labour as expected by Roger and others, so too have
changes in the composition of the global seafarers' labour market been
accompanied by more continuities than fractures. Changes in the nationality
composition of modern-day crews, while significant for a variety of reasons,
have not generally had the overwhelming impact that might have been
envisaged in terms of life and work aboard.[6] In today's fleet, contractual
engagement and occupational culture remain the key to any understanding of
everyday life aboard merchant ships. Regardless of crew nationality, a
fundamental feature of modern ships is that, although they do not house
organic communities marked by population or social network continuities,
crews of complete strangers nevertheless find familiar, integrating social
mechanisms. The familiar and limited number of shipboard roles, the
boundaries of permissible variation in role performance, the simplicity of
formal and normative rules patterning shipboard conduct are universal and,
therefore, create the essential conditions for making the transfer of people
###### between ships possible - a necessary requirement in the context of
discontinuous, casual employment contracts and mixed nationality crews of
unpredictable permutations. In these circumstances of employment insecurity
and a resilient shipboard occupational culture, national identities are
essentially redundant for the purposes of everyday life. Conflicts in the home
countries of crew members may, under certain conditions, "reawaken" national
identities aboard ship, but there is little evidence of the significance of national
###### identity as a routinely potent source of conflict among seafarers and a good
deal of evidence to the contrary.[7] Indeed, one comprehensive study of mixed
nationality crews has demonstrated that the vast majority (approximately 80
###### per cent) of seafarers prefer to work aboard mixed nationality vessels.[8]

Living aboard similar ships, doing similar work, visiting similar places and
experiencing a regular stream of encounters with fellow crew members who
are also strangers but are nevertheless "people just like us" all support and
encourage the maintenance of a viable and "living" occupational culture. The
manifestations of the elements of this occupational culture may in themselves
seem insubstantial, but they form a powerful compound when taken together.
Something of this can be seen in the pervasive practice among seafarers of
relating stories to each other of experiences of past ships and shipmates.
Regardless of the nationality composition of crews, story-telling remains an
###### important part of life aboard and has not been displaced by the sophisticated entertainment and communication systems found on well-equipped ships.
Stories are typically told in those passing moments when there are just
minutes to spare but there is a need to assert some social contact. In their
###### content these stories are not necessarily or even often extensive narratives

The global

###### with elaborate plots punctuated by climaxes and denouements. They just tell of bars visited, beautiful women, lively ports, sad shipmates, storms and calms,
good and bad captains, devious crewing agents, abominable food, and the like.
Such story-telling encourages inclusion because it offers snapshots of
moments that everyone can relate to regardless of who they are or where they
come from. Such tales have a long tradition and a "solidifying" effect both in
the telling and in the enactment of everyday shipboard life. In this, as well as
in work content, work routines and the social relations of hierarchy, there is
###### much to demonstrate the continuing existence of strong shipboard
occupational cultures in the new era of global crewing.[9]

Ships continue to have formal hierarchical structures, where officers
form approximately 40 per cent and ratings 60 per cent of total complements.
###### For a variety of reasons, modern cargo ships are predominantly male
environments, which continue to be characterized by occupational hierarchies
###### that are often relatively inflexible. Crews are divided into officers and ratings
and within each of these groups further ranks exist, ranging from chief
engineer to 4th engineer, from captain to 3rd officer and from bosun to OS.
The occupational hierarchy aboard most ships is so important that it is quite
usual for crew members to introduce and refer to themselves and others by
rank, rather than name. Nicknames can also derive from rank and are often
passed from one crew member to their reliever, outliving the tour of duty of
any individual. Thus, pumpmen are commonly referred to as "pumps" or
"pumpie", radio officers were known as "sparks", electricians as "leckies", and
so on. Accommodation and messing arrangements generally reflect this
layering, although this has not been the case aboard Chinese vessels, where
recent attempts to introduce separate officer and rating dining were thwarted.
###### Aboard the ships of one major shipping line, Chinese crews resisted efforts to introduce separate messing and expressed strong preferences for dining with
colleagues from within their "department". Thus, deck ratings and officers
share a table, engine-room staff dine together as do catering staff.[1][0] Elsewhere
in the world fleet, there are ships where officers and ratings eat in the same
space, but in general officer/rating separation is normal and off-duty social
###### interaction between higher and lower ranks is infrequent.

Although on genuinely multinational ships nationality does not have a
###### strong impact on social or working relations, different patterns can sometimes
be seen aboard ships with only two or three nationalities. Where ships have fewer
nationalities, transnational solidarities may be weak and sometimes have a
"colonial" character, especially where ratings are from less economically
developed countries and officers are from relatively prosperous countries. Aboard
these ships, divisions between officers and ratings can be reinterpreted along
nationality rather than occupational lines. Thus, aboard one ship, everybody

beneath the rank of 2nd officer and chief engineer may be counted as a "rating"
because they belong to the same nationality, while aboard a different vessel
everybody from fitter upwards might be given access to officer facilities on the
grounds of nationality.[1][1] Aboard ships with these crewing patterns,
discriminatory practices are likely to be more frequent. The best available
evidence of discrimination on the grounds of race/nationality comes from a poll
conducted for the ITF in 1996 by the MORI polling group. In response to the
question of whether in the last year respondents had experienced "unfair
treatment because of my race/nationality?", some 66 per cent said "not at all",
20 per cent replied "sometimes", 5 per cent said "frequently" and 9 per cent had
"no opinion". These responses, however, were not analysed on the basis of crew
nationality composition and, therefore, it is not possible to identify the extent
to which "crew nationality mix" had an impact on the MORI findings.[1][2]

###### It has been suggested that cultural differences might have an impact on
initiative, submission to authority and rule following,[13] and in the 1990s such
views gained wide support within some sectors of the industry. However, more
recent and comprehensive data collected from observation studies aboard
multinationally crewed ships[1][4] suggest that such cultural generalizations are
misleading and unhelpful. Sometimes they are sustained by literature provided
by well-intentioned crew managers and shipowners and designed to "inform"
seafarers of one ethnic group about the culture of others. Unfortunately, some
of this literature inadequately differentiates between cultural habits/norms
and variations in individual behaviour, and so end up reinforcing stereotyped
beliefs and prejudices rather than reducing them. Once seafarers of different
nationalities have had a significant amount of contact with one another, they
become aware of the inaccuracy of many stereotypes and generalizations.
###### Only where their exposure to a particular nationality is limited do seafarers
show a tendency to fall back on stereotyped views of others.[1][5]

###### Although the available evidence indicates relatively low levels of
discriminatory practices aboard mixed nationality crewed ships, there are some
accounts of discrimination by officers towards both officers and ratings of
###### other ethnic groups. Discrimination and prejudice have also been reported
among ratings.[1][6] Wherever such attitudes and practices exist, they produce
unwarranted divisions and impede the safe and effective running of ships. Two
issues spring to mind regarding appropriate policies: the extent to which all
employers have effective anti-discriminatory procedures in place and the
quality and reliability of the STCW human relationships model course
###### component of the basic safety training certificate. As discussed in Chapter 3,
fraudulent practice in basic safety training certification is widespread.

As in all work situations where men outnumber women, it is common for
women seafarers to experience institutional discrimination. Sexual harassment

99


-----

The global seafarer

may also be commonplace, although it is less likely to be an institutional
practice. More and more employers, especially those in the cruise sector where
###### women form a large and growing proportion of crews, have formal policies in
place that are specifically aimed at combating sexual harassment. However, if
these policies simply define proscribed behaviour, then sexual harassment is
###### not likely to be eliminated. Indeed, there is ample evidence of harassment.[1][7] In
cruise ships this may sometimes be masked in the ambiguous badinage often
###### found in mixed gender workplaces, but when it is experienced aboard cargo
ships, sexual harassment can appear more menacing. Women who have sailed
aboard these types of ships have almost invariably reported instances that
applied to themselves or to others known to them       - to the extent that they felt
obliged to lock their cabin doors at night to keep out predatory males.

The occupational hierarchies that are sometimes quite formally observed
aboard ship can cause problems and dangers, regardless of the national make-
up of the crew. The levelling of the shipboard management and decision-
making process envisaged by Roger[18] has generally failed to materialize. Many
ships continue to be run along strictly hierarchical lines by masters who
discourage "challenges" to their authority. The inevitable transient nature of
working on deep-sea vessels and the associated isolation of crew members place
severe limits on the visibility of shipboard power relations and, therefore, the
ability of shore-based managers to influence directly the regulation of ship
society. The social and physical distance of the ship from its managers can
sometimes have dangerous consequences. The loss of the MV Green Lily off
the Shetland Islands in the United Kingdom and the associated death of a
###### helicopter winchman in 1997 is a case in point, although there are many other
incidences that are talked of privately among shipowners and managers. In the
case of the Green Lily, the vessel's master, chief engineer, 2nd engineer, 3rd
engineer, chief officer and 2nd officer were all Croatian nationals. The United
Kingdom's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) report into the
incident suggested that the junior officers were unwilling to challenge the
decision of the master to sail in very poor weather conditions, despite their
belief that he was making an error of judgement. The report concluded that the
###### master's autocratic style of management was a causal factor in the accident.

Transnational crews are very rarely assembled simultaneously. Hence,
crews are made up of strangers who become shipmates, which means that the
social aspect of seafarers' employment, taken together with its casual nature,
is experienced as a series of discontinuous and discontinued encounters.
Casual employment for all ranks is the norm wherever seafarers are engaged
###### through third parties. Only where the shipowner is a direct employer is there
a possibility of an employment contract extending beyond the current
engagement. These aspects of employment are registered in the commonplace

seafarer remark that "a friendship ends at the gangway". Aboard ship, there are
surprisingly few team-building routines and rituals to help counter these
###### discontinuities. And few officers receive proper instruction in team-
management during their professional training.

Perhaps partly as a consequence, social life aboard merchant ships is
subject to considerable variation, and much depends on the individual ship's
workload and trade. Aboard many vessels there simply isn't the time or space
###### for recreational activities, and seafarers often experience many months of monotony broken only by the demands of heavy workloads. However,
existing data suggest that the attitude of the master is the single most
###### important factor influencing the "happiness" of seafarers aboard ship, a factor that has long been recognized.[1][9] Where masters actively encourage
recreational activities, they can take a variety of forms: birthday celebrations;
regular barbecues; darts or table tennis tournaments; bingo, card games, maj
jong; and "horse racing". Aboard many ships, seafarers occasionally have the
###### opportunity to play basketball, practise their tennis or golf techniques, play
music, sing karaoke, box, or work out in the gym. However, in ships where
masters disapprove of such activities, even when schedules and facilities allow
for a reasonable range of social activities, seafarers tend to withdraw to their
separate cabins and mix little with their colleagues.[20]

An additional factor influencing the social life of seafarers on board ship
relates to alcohol consumption. In 1979, Hoegh Lines introduced crew bars
aboard their vessels,[21] in recognition of the importance of fostering drinking
habits linked with sociability rather than those encouraging isolation and
introspection. Other companies promptly followed suit, and separate officer
and crew bars came to be incorporated into the design of many new vessels.
However, in recent years many firms have responded to international concerns
about health and safety by introducing complete bans or strict limits and
restrictions on the consumption of alcohol. As a result, some shipboard bars
are now underused spaces     - a forlorn reminder of happier times. Such
international and company-based restrictions on alcohol generally have a
negative impact on seafarers' social lives. Not only do complete bans
discourage the scheduling of communal events such as barbecues and so on,
###### they also encourage solitary drinking behind closed (cabin) doors, which promotes social isolation and can endanger mental health.[22] It also inhibits the
development of team relations and marks a significant break with many of the
traditions associated with mariners' lives.

With or without the assistance of alcohol, a large part of the social
interaction aboard ship involves telling jokes and using joking strategies.
Making jokes is frequently risky, since it relies on a fairly sophisticated
###### understanding of the "rules" of social interaction and an ability to implement

101


-----

The global seafarer

such "rules". Seafarers are generally not regarded by their land-based
contemporaries as having good social skills and, indeed, mariners are often
###### thought of as "loners" - except, of course, when seen ashore by outsiders.
However, their skilled use of jokes and their ability to maintain cordial relations
###### with colleagues, with whom they may have little in common, during stressful, tiring and highly confined months aboard ship imply that the contrary is true.
Multinational crews are particularly impressive in their ability to overcome
cultural barriers and uncertainties well enough to be able to use humour aboard,
###### although crew members with poor language skills may avoid making jokes and thereby miss out on an important aspect of a crew's social life.[23]

The decision to avoid joking with fellow seafarers or the inability to
participate in social banter and tell jokes is likely to contribute to a seafarer's
sense of isolation. This can be a serious problem aboard modern-day vessels,
which often spend very little time in port. Recent studies have highlighted the
###### disproportionate levels of suicide among seafarers in comparison with other
occupational groups.[24] These and general mental health problems, such as
depression and those that result in addictive behavioural patterns, can thrive in
an environment of social isolation.[25]

While there is no evidence to suggest that the exposure rates of women
seafarers to general mental health problems are higher than those for men, it
is certainly possible that women seafarers, especially those working in the
cargo sector where women crew members number at most one or two, tend to
be more isolated. The 2001 SIRC paper on women seafarers reported that
###### women working in otherwise all-male environments often find themselves
"spending excessive amounts of time in their cabins pursuing solitary
activities" as a way of avoiding the gossip apt to develop if they engaged in
socializing with male crew members in their cabins. The report quotes a
woman captain as saying: "You can't go to somebody's room and just sit
down, because [...] all the crew are men. [Since] I was a captain, you can
imagine how miserable it was."[26]

The ability to communicate in such an isolated and independent context
is crucial. Yet, on many of the vessels in the modern international fleet, the
###### stated common working language of the ship is English, which is usually a
second language for everyone on board. Communication difficulties can,
###### therefore, pose a major challenge to mixed nationality crews. Many seafarers
have expressed the view that, although there are benefits to working with
###### other nationalities, the negative side of working in multinational crews is that
it is much harder to communicate effectively.[27]

Sometimes miscommunication can cause work-related problems.
###### Whether classified as merely irritating or actually hazardous, such problems tend to be exacerbated by the unwillingness of individuals to admit to any

102

difficulties in understanding or communicating. The working culture of most
ships probably does not help much in this respect. Senior officers exercise a
considerable amount of power over juniors and even more so over ratings.
Closed reporting systems and practices of "blacklisting" seafarers combine to
create a certain amount of fear among all but the most senior ranking, and
most seafarers are consequently afraid of being seen as less than competent in
any aspect of their job, including their fluency in English.

Occasionally, incidents occur that might have serious consequences for
seafarers and the environment. In such cases, the circumstances in which
communication takes place are relevant. The conditions on board ship, the
environment in which the work is being carried out and the communications
equipment employed all increase the risk of errors being made, whichever
language is being used and regardless of the linguistic competence of the
seafarers. Even a native English speaker can find it difficult to understand what
is being said on a VHP radio aboard a noisy vessel, let alone above the noise of
the engine room.

The ability to communicate not only depends on a technical grasp of the
language but also on a facility to understand accents and new and particular
forms of language. The maritime English taught in nautical schools is one such
new form of the language. Aboard vessels with multinational crews, you can
also come across Chinese English, Filipino English, German English and
Singaporean English. Words and expression from several of these languages
can then find their way into the vocabulary of stable and long-established
crews. The development of such individualized ship languages appears to
reinforce other integrative mechanisms aboard and adds to the social cement
binding many crews together. However, situations in which such ship-based
"languages" can develop are becoming increasingly rare.[28] The global labour
market and the drive for cheaper labour sources militate against establishing
crews who serve together for significant lengths of time. Once company
mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcy are added into the equation, it is easy to
see why seafarers rarely find familiar faces among the crews they join on
###### returning to work after a period ashore. Such fluidity means that, in practice,
seafarers are constantly having to adapt to the language and accents of their
newly encountered, fellow crew members, a process that can be stressful and
which is not helped by fears of being misunderstood.

###### Turnaround and voyage cycles

A number of studies have highlighted the monotony of working and living
aboard modern cargo ships, and structural changes within the industry can be
said to have exacerbated the boredom and social isolation that have always

been a feature of a seafarer's working life. Containerization has meant that
such ships now "turn around" much faster than they did in the cargo liner
trades 20 years ago and a recent study has demonstrated that all ships spend
considerably less time in port than 30 years ago.[29]

In 1998, 27 per cent (number = 428) of the ships visiting the port of
Sandmouth[30] (a middle-sized port in the United Kingdom, with a cross-
section of trades) spent less than 12 hours in port (figures 4.1 and 4.2),
whereas only 11 per cent of ships visiting the port in 1970 had a port stay of
less than 24 hours. Forty-five per cent (n. = 707) of the 1998 arrivals spent 13
###### to 24 hours in port and this made up the largest category of ship turnaround
times. The data show that, in 1998, seven out of ten ships turned around
###### within 24 hours and only 4 per cent (n. = 58) of the ships stayed in port for
more than three days.

This dramatic change in turnaround times has occurred even though
###### there has been a substantial increase in tonnage. Between 1970 and 1998, the
tonnage of ships calling at Sandmouth increased fourfold, but, despite this
increase in ship size, turnaround times decreased ninefold. Table 4.1 shows the
comparative turnaround times for ships with different cargoes.

Ships are places where displaced people come together and form
occupational communities, which are themselves isolated from wider society.
This isolation has been exacerbated by the ongoing and immense reduction in
###### turnaround times since 1970. In theory, no matter how short turnaround time

is, it should still be possible for seafarers to be granted shore leave. However,
in practical terms this is extremely difficult, since there are a number of
additional factors that contribute to making it difficult for seafarers to go
ashore:

      - intense workload while ships are in port;

      - a decline in crewing levels;

      - port locations and environments;

      - security measures.

The global seafarer

###### On top of the normal everyday routine work on board for all crew members, there is also additional work that has to be undertaken in port, mainly by senior
officers. This includes dealing with visitors (that is, immigration and customs
officers, PSC inspectors, cargo surveyors, flag State and class surveyors and so
on), loading/unloading cargo, lashing and unlashing cargo, dealing with cargo
plans, bunkering, crew changes, taking stores as well as the many additional
engine and maintenance tasks that can only be done while the ship is stationary
and in port. Furthermore, modern ports frequently work 24 hours a day, which
means that pressure only begins to ease when the ship returns to sea. Security
restrictions imposed in the United States in the aftermath of the events of 11
September 2001 have made it impossible, at least for the foreseeable future, for
many seafarers to take shore leave while their vessels are in port there.

###### In addition, during the past 20 years or so, there has been a reduction in
the size of crews. In the early 1970s, a typical 10,000 grt bulk cargo carrier
###### would have had approximately 40 crew members. Today, a much larger (that is,
30,000 grt) bulk carrier is likely to have only 18 to 25 crew members on board.
###### The same crew-size pattern applies to cargo-carrying ships of all kinds. The
decline in the size of crews also makes it difficult for seafarers to be given shore
leave. Smaller crews mean that labour is intensified, with seafarers working
longer hours and performing flexible tasks. These issues are illustrated by the
following quotations taken from interviews with seafarers visiting Sandmouth,
###### ITF inspectors and port welfare workers (boxes 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3).

Box 4.1 "To go ashore, you had to be super-human!"

There aren't crew members like captain's boy, mess boy, second cook, oiler or wiper
any more. This ship's captain does the chief officer's job as well. We have two ABs,
but that's not enough for this ship. This ship used to have 16 crew, but there are only
six now. We do more work. We have no time to go ashore.

Lithuanian bosun

My seafaring career lasted 20 years and I've experienced big changes, working on
fast turnaround ships, ro-ros and containers, where we had full crew complements of
26/27 men, a three-watch system, with good time off. So even on a fast turnaround
ship, when we didn't have much time off duty, you had adequate rest periods and you
had time off ashore because you had enough manpower and you benefited from very
good leave periods        - nearly one-for-one leave periods. Towards the end of my
seafaring career, though, the manpower was reduced, so there were fewer people to
perform more work. Instead of a three-watch system, you were doing a two-watch
system, so you were either working or sleeping. To go ashore, you really had to be
super-human!

Box 4.2 Ports are "far away from anything"

With containerization, you need a lot of room. And you need room where it's
cheapest to build a container terminai. So this is out in the hinterland and it's very
difficult and very expensive to go anywhere. As the industry has changed, the
terminal facilities have changed, it's all changed with containerization. In San
Francisco, we had the Embargendero, which is the street that runs along the
waterfront, which used to be full of ships. And now that's all gone and the ships are
15 to 20 miles away. They're not just far away from San Francisco, they're far away
from anything      - no municipal transport because there's no people nearby other than
the people involved in the terminals on shore who drive where they're going and
drive home. There's no reason for the municipalities to put in a bus service. So these
guys lead very isolated lives.

ITF Northern Californian inspector

Recently, the environment around ports has changed a lot. In the old days, when
there were European       - German, English, Swedish       - crews, we used to spend money.
There were girls and many pubs around the ports. For example, the Swedish ports
were busy with girls and drinks. Porto was the same. Now these ports are barely
recognizable. The cheap labour crews don't spend money. When the foreign

[non-European] crews come to port, they can only buy one can of beer. They have no
money to go out with girls.

German captain

Traditionally, ports were located near city centres; these ports, such as
Liverpool, San Francisco and Yokohama, are now regarded as historical
###### ports and docks. By contrast, modern port development generally takes place
some distance away from residential and shopping areas. These ports are
###### automated, unpeopled, steel-framed and are not served by public transport
(box 4.2).

Fast turnaround times have limited the possibilities for seafarers to have
any form of social contact beyond the shipboard community, while the
reduction in crewing levels has diminished both the extent and the quality of
social contact at sea. Of course, cargo ships are not built primarily to
accommodate seafarers, but these are places where many everyday activities
(such as working, eating, sleeping and socializing) take place in a restricted
environment characterized by vibration, sea motion and engine noise. Lack of
shore leave means that many seafarers are trapped in this environment, often
with a set of people of different nationalities and cultures for months at a time.
There is, therefore, increasing concern that lack of shore leave is having a
detrimental effect on the mental and physical well-being of seafarers as well as
reinforcing isolation, fatigue, depression and stress.

Box 4.3 "By the end, a certain madness attacks some crew members"

It's a major problem. There's no social life when you go to sea, it's total isolation. You
could say that the cabin crew of an aeroplane do something similar, but a seafarer
might go from, for example, I've done runs from, say, Singapore to the Philippines to
New Zealand and back to western Australia. So, for maybe 15 weeks you get no mail,
you do not go ashore, and by the end, a certain madness attacks some crew
members. Very small things become very big things. Things like insomnia: many of the
crew will be pacing the alleyways at 3 o'clock in the morning. Alcoholism can rise a
great deal if alcohol's available. Many seafarers are on different types of medication
###### - Valium and that kind of thing and anti-depressants. Much higher than the regular
population.

Former seafarer of Australian origin

Working on the feeder container vessels, some calling at three ports in 24 hours (that
is, Tilbury-Zeebrugge-Tilbury) would mean that, after three weeks on board, people's
behaviour became automatic. Occasionally, I used to go from Tilbury to Zeebrugge
or Rotterdam. One of the vessels didn't have a regular ship's agent and I would turn
up at all times of the day or night with parcels ordered from the previous trip plus the
mission bus to take the seafarers to the mission. I once visited a vessel at 7.30am in
Zeebrugge, but when they asked me to take them to the mission, I refused, which
surprised them. Apparently, because I had turned up, the crew assumed that the ship
had to be in Tilbury. When I said, "Look out of the porthole", they were amazed that
they were not in Tilbury but in Zeebrugge. Throughout my 28 years as a chaplain, I've
seen increasingly smaller crews, less time spent in port, more abuse and welfare and
justice cases, and the growth of FOC flag vessels. There has also been an increase
in workload. This also increases stress             - it's a killer. That is something I have seen over
the years. Of course, working for some companies is better than for others, but stress
is so obvious, I can comment on that             - it is getting worse.

Mission to Seafarers' chaplain

Seafarers' lives, even in the best situation, are very grim, very lifeless and very devoid
of any joie de vivre          - it's just work. They work tremendous hours and they have
nowhere to go, either at sea or in port. One of the big innovations since I started going
to sea is video tapes, but after you've seen Terminator 3 for the fourth time, I'm sure
that it gets to them.

American ex-seafarer

Being in this ship all the time gets to you. The ship is damp; it's sometimes cold. The
food isn't fresh. There's noise and vibration. When the ship goes, it vibrates. We are
always on board. I work here, eat here, sleep here. Sometimes it creates
psychological problems. You're away from your home. No news from your country.

###### Wages and conditions of employment

The global character of the shipping industry means that the nature of the
decisions that present themselves to those within it differ qualitatively from
those made in other industries, no matter how global their organizational span
may be. If a manufacturing plant is to be built in second or third countries, for
example, the wage component of the calculation involved in deciding which
###### country to build it in is a once-and-for-all decision. A cheaper and adequately
skilled supply of labour in a fourth of fifth country may become available
subsequently, but given the location of the newly established plant, this
###### potential labour supply may be prohibitively expensive and politically
impossible to import for employment. Either the plant has to be relocated or
the owner has to circumvent national laws concerning the use of foreign
labour. None of these limitations applies to shipowners. As seen in Chapter 3,
the composition of the labour force can easily be changed.

As there is a large global pool of sufficiently skilled and mobile labour in
the shipping industry, the wage and employment market is highly competitive
and sometimes volatile. The fact that employers drive the labour market and
###### that intervention by national States and para-national organizations is minor
makes employment contracts and practices highly variable. In a labour market
consisting of many nationalities and far more numerous employers spread
across sectors with different labour standards requirements and operating in
quality-stratified freight markets, it is, unsurprisingly, difficult to assemble
data on wages and conditions. Accordingly, it is only possible to give the most
general overview of these issues.

The ISF conducts regular surveys of wage rates, and these show large
###### variations between the average monthly earnings of ABs of various
nationalities. The 1992 survey found that the average monthly earnings of a
German AB ($5,758) were 19 times higher than the earnings of a Bangladeshi
AB ($305), while average earnings in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom
were similar to the level of average earnings for all countries surveyed ($1,762).
All nationalities earning above the international average were from either
Western Europe or other developed parts of the world (Australia, Japan, New
Zealand and the United States).

The ISF's 1995 survey showed that the nationalities earning above-
average wages were more or less the same as in 1992, except that Sri Lankan
and Taiwanese seafarers had joined those earning more than the international
average. The 1995 data also revealed the appearance of new, low-paying labour
supply countries in the global market. The gap between the lowest and highest
average earning countries remained, with the average earnings of Japanese ABs
($9,349) being 41 times higher than the lowest paid     - Bangladeshi seafarers on

$227. The 1999 survey showed the average earnings of ABs to be $1,318, or
###### three-quarters of the 1992 average. The downward movement of the overall
average in this period almost certainly reflects the continuing displacement of
relatively expensive OECD seafarers by those from the new and more
established labour supply countries of Asia and Eastern Europe. Figure 4.3
shows the comparative wage costs for ABs in 1999.

###### In the period 1992-99, supply fell short of demand in the global labour
market for officers, which led to an upward pressure on wages. The ISF
surveys of chief officer wage rates confirm this situation: the rates of pay in
the major officer supply countries rose steadily from 1993.

An analysis of these data by nationality shows that average pay rates for
Filipino chief officers increased by 1.6 per cent in 1993-94, by 4 per cent in
1994-95 and by 14 per cent in 1995-96. The average rates of pay for Polish
officers also increased by nearly 50 per cent in the same period. By contrast,
average pay rates for chief officers in the United Kingdom fell by nearly 10 per
cent; currently there appear to be a number of Indian and Polish chief officers
being paid above the rates of their lowest paid British counterparts.
Comparisons of this kind need to be made with caution to ensure that due
account is taken of the fact that chief officers of different nationalities may
###### not hold positions that are comparable in terms of type of ship and market
sector, while the movements in United States dollar exchange rates can

enhance or diminish purchasing power according to the currency of the
seafarer's native State.

The most recent and most reliable data source on wage rates comes from
the 1996 ITF/MORI survey, which drew 6,504 responses from seafarers of
various nationalities.[31] It classified the monthly wages of seafarers into 13
bands, as shown in the analysis of responses in table 4.2. The analysis has been
simplified here by breaking down the categories into "Low" (less than $300 to
$499), "Medium" ($500 to $2,999) and "High" ($3,000 to more than $4,000).[32]

###### On this basis, 18 per cent of seafarers fall in the low category, 75 per cent in
the medium and 7 per cent in the high category, although it should be noted
###### that these wage levels are strongly influenced by the seafarers' nationalities and
ranks and the type and flag of vessel.

Where a ship's flag is concerned, some 10 per cent of seafarers employed
aboard FOC-flagged vessels fall within the high earnings band; aboard
nationally flagged vessels 15 per cent receive high earnings. Aboard the
nationally flagged vessels of Greece, the Philippines, Romania and the Russian
Federation, the figures for the low band are 26 per cent, 27 per cent, 28 per
cent and 29 per cent respectively. Nationality is, of course, the most important
###### determinant of wage levels; unsurprisingly, seafarers working aboard the
nationally flagged vessels of low-wage countries receive low pay. Forty per

cent of seafarers from Ukraine fall into the low wage band, 31 per cent from
Africa and the Middle East, 30 per cent from Croatia and 27 per cent from
China. Table 4.3 shows how rank affects monthly wages. Apart from the
obvious distinction between officers and ratings, there are considerable
differences within rank groups        - another indication of the importance of
nationality. Where vessel type is concerned, the lowest paid seafarers are most
###### commonly found on general cargo and bulk carriers, the highest paid on
tankers and passenger vessels.

###### Aboard cruise ships, officers and managers are among the highest paid personnel within the shipping industry, mainly because these positions attract
bonuses that are given either at the end of the voyage, the end of the season
###### or the end of the year.[33] In the hotel and catering departments, seafarers are
divided into wage earners and tip earners. Tip earners are primarily those who
provide direct services to the passengers, such as waiters/waitresses and
stewards/stewardesses. In this case, the crew members receive a small monthly
###### payment from the company and are expected to make up the rest of their monthly wages from tips or gratuities given by the passengers. Most cruise
lines advise their passengers that they are expected to tip at a specified
minimum rate per day. Pay levels and pay methods vary from company to
company and, more importantly, according to the region in which the ship
operates. In the Caribbean, the Bahamas and other regions where most of the
passengers are from the United States, seafarers typically receive a monthly
wage from their company of $50. This payment is nominal.

Cruise lines operating in Asia and Europe tend to pay service seafarers
fixed monthly wages, principally because European passengers are less

112

generous tippers than North American passengers. Asian passengers also
rarely give tips. These variations presumably reflect differing assumptions
about service sector payment systems. Wage levels vary greatly, from $270 to
$2,400 per month for the same or similar positions. Variations are due to
several factors, of which nationality is the most important. For example,
waitresses from France, Germany and the United Kingdom are paid more than
double the wages paid to waitresses from Indonesia, the Philippines and
Thailand on a top-market cruise ship operating worldwide. Similar patterns are
found in ships operating in the Asia-Pacific region.

The geographical area within which the ship is operating also contributes
###### to the way in which tips are given. In Asia and Europe, companies advise
passengers to pay tips at the end of the voyage, although this advice is not
given as strongly as on American-based ships. In Asia, tips are collected by the
management and shared among the crew rather than paid to the service
seafarers who have had direct contact with the passengers.

In recent years, some cruise lines have introduced a system of security
bonds, the purpose of which is to ensure that seafarers provide proper service
and complete their contracts. The most widely adopted practice is to deduct a
certain amount of money, usually $100, from a seafarer's wages every month.
The money is kept until the end of the seafarer's contract, when it is paid as
"leave pay". However, this practice is generally not applied to tip-earning
seafarers, nor does it seem to be applied to seafarers employed from industrial-
ized countries.

Wage regulation in various forms is well-established in the shipping
###### industry but its impact is uneven and fragmented. There are two quite
different wage regulatory practices: one derives from the ILO, under whose
aegis employers and trade unions periodically meet to set a minimum
benchmark wage; the other originates with the ITF, which aims to regulate
wage payments aboard FOG ships.

There are several competing definitions and interpretations of what is
known as the ILO minimum wage. The mechanism for setting the minimum
wage is provided by the ILO Seafarers' Wages, Hours of Work and the
Manning of Ships Recommendation, 1996 (No. 187). In 2000, the ILO
minimum wage standard stood at $435 per month for an AB, based on a
maximum 48-hour week. However, the ITF and the ISF each use this figure as
an indicative minimum rather than as a substantive level and, accordingly,
make additional calculations and arrive at divergent sums: in 2000, the ISF
calculated the minimum wage standard as $563 per month and the ITF as $823.

There seem to be two issues concerning the ILO account of minimum
wages. Firstly, the substantive content of the Recommendation itself; secondly,
the legal status of the agreed Recommendation. With regard to the former, the

113


-----

The global seafarer

###### ILO minimum wage, and the interpretations based on it, are only set for an AB.
The Recommendation does not provide any means of calculating wage levels
###### for other ranks. Secondly, the ILO instrument only provides a definition of the
rate at which overtime should be paid (1.25 times the hourly rate of pay),
###### without referring to the number of overtime hours that may be worked.

The legal status of Recommendation No. 187 is weakened owing to its
status as a Recommendation rather than a Convention. International labour
Recommendations are not mandatory for signatories, unless a government
chooses to make them so through its own legislation. Furthermore, derogation
is permitted through collective bargaining where it is formally recognized by a
government. As a result, discrepant interpretations of the ILO minimum wages
agreements are inevitable. The content, status and effective downplaying of the
Recommendations by PSCs have rendered this "legislation" almost wholly
ineffective as a regulatory instrument. On the other hand, the vigorous conduct
of negotiations at the ILO when the minimum wage is due for revision suggests
###### that it has more than symbolic significance for real wage rates.
 Compared with the shrouded meanings surrounding ILO minimum
wages standards, the ITF standards set out in the "Standard" and "Total Crew
###### Cost" (TCC) Agreements have the form and content of conventional
contracts. The 1998 ITF Standard Collective Agreement sets $934 per month
(based on a 40-hour week) as the acceptable wage standard for an AB, and, as
###### with Recommendation No. 187, defines the rate of overtime without giving
maximum weekly hours. By contrast, the ITF Uniform TCC Collective
Agreement rate for an AB is $1,204 per month, based on a 40-hour week and
a guaranteed overtime of 103 hours per month paid at an hourly rate of $3.94.
This explicit coverage of overtime has the advantage of providing strict
conditions for the length of the working month. The TCC Agreement also
covers a whole range of other contractual issues, such as allotments, disability
compensation, repatriation, sick pay, paid leave and so on. In 1999, 5,255
vessels were covered by ITF agreements, a 15 per cent increase on 1998. These
agreements covered approximately 116,000 seafarers, of which some 90 per
###### cent were on TCC agreements. The ITF estimates that about 35 per cent of all
seafarers on FOC vessels are covered. Many ITF national affiliates now spend
much of their time and resources negotiating and enforcing ITF agreements
###### for FOC vessels, rather than negotiating with national shipowners. Some FOCs also have a higher percentage of their vessels covered by these
agreements than some national flags. Table 4.4 gives a general indication of
###### ITF agreement coverage on variously flagged ships.

In 2000, the ITF and the IMEC set up permanent machinery for the
###### negotiation of the TCC rate for ABs. The joint committee, known as the IMEC-ITF at the time of writing, agreed to an annual increase of $50, to run

###### from 2001 until 2005. The initial scope and influence of the joint committee
was limited by the number of shipowners and managers affiliated to the
###### IMEC, but the rise in numbers of affiliated employers in late 2002 and early
2003 has helped to solidify this important development in international
collective bargaining.

An important characteristic of seafarers' work is that, for the most part,
###### it is contracted for the voyage only. Income does not flow steadily and can
change according to the seafarers' good fortune in getting the next contract or,
contrarily, by the flow of labour from lower wage labour supply countries
displacing them. As previously noted, seafarers are employed on a casual basis.
###### And even though shipmasters and chief engineers of proven experience are
unlikely to be without work, more often than not they have periods without
###### contracts. However, a more prominent concern for shipmasters and chief
engineers is likely to be the duration of the contract. European shipmasters in
some trades can reasonably expect contracts of three months on voyage and
###### three months' leave. Shipmasters of Eastern European nationalities, by
comparison, are more likely to have contracts requiring longer periods at sea
and shorter periods at home. Contracts as well as wages are stratified by
###### nationality and this applies to all ranks.
 For ratings, a typical contract for Filipinos lasts nine months, 12 months for Sierra Leoneans and six months for Eastern Europeans. Typical senior
Western European officers' contracts are three to four months in length
compared with six to nine months for their Filipino and Indian counterparts.
A survey of 4,525 seafarers, conducted under the auspices of the ILO, found
###### that in more than 50 per cent of cases, the longest contract period worked by
seafarers was over one year in duration.[34] Without a proper relief system, it is
inevitable that ratings will be pressurized into staying on board for longer
periods than the specified length of their contracts.

The ITF/MORI survey showed that the most common length of
###### contract is between six and 12 months, although, as with wages, this varies with flag, vessel type, nationality and rank. In contrast to wages, the
employing agency appears to be a significant factor when it comes to contracts
###### of employment as distinct from voyage contracts. Overall, 12 per cent of
seafarers indicated that their current contract was for more than 12 months.
###### For all national flags, this rises to 17 per cent, but for FOCs it is 8 per cent. With regard to vessel type, the extremes of contract length are even more
apparent. While 12 per cent of all contracts are over 12 months in length, for
seafarers on passenger vessels this rises to 37 per cent, but for chemical carrier
crews it is only 5 per cent. With regard to crewing agencies, union recruitment
offers the most secure employment, with 25 per cent of seafarers employed
###### through this route having contracts of employment of over 12 months in

116

life I

length. Those employed by private crewing agencies have contracts of this
duration in only 6 per cent of cases.

Contracts are sometimes used to limit seafarers' access to benefits,
additional remuneration and/or trade union representation rights. In Sri Lanka,
###### for example, the Standard Crew Agreement made under the provisions of the
Merchant Shipping Act Number 52 of 1971 specifically states that representations
in the event of any dispute over terms and conditions may only be made to the
owner or master and to no other organization. Similar practices were reported
###### by the Greek seamen's union, which discovered in 1986 that Polish seamen
working aboard Greek-flagged ships were in some cases required to sign letters
of loyalty "undertaking that they will never seek any additional payment or
benefits over and above the terms of the contract". The letter states:

This applies especially to the possible event that the owner and/or captain of the
vessel should be forced by the ITF anywhere to pay a higher wage or extra salary
to me or granted to me any additional condition which should be a disadvantage
to the mutual employment contract for the owner and/or captain of the vessel.
I especially confirm that in such above case I will consider this extra payment as
advance payment, which the owner and/or captain is entitled to deduct at any time
from my subsequent wages.[35]

Where the length of the working week or month is concerned, there is
a wide variety of stipulations. The ITF Uniform TCC Collective Agreement
specifies that the ordinary hours of duty of all seafarers shall be eight hours
###### per day, Monday to Friday inclusive. The standard Filipino employment contract requires that normal working hours be eight hours in every 24 hours, midnight to midnight, Monday to Sunday. The Sri Lankan standard contract specifies that the normal working week should be 44 hours, while the Collective Agreement for Cypriot seafarers aboard Cypriot-flagged
cargo and tanker vessels states that the hours of monthly compulsory
###### employment are 173.

Actual hours worked, including overtime, are frequently very high
compared with most shore jobs. This can be seen in the hours of work
###### reported by some seafarers in the ITF/MORI survey.[36] The 1996 survey
revealed that, overall, 24 per cent of respondents had a typical working day of
up to eight hours; 62 per cent worked eight to 12 hours; 11 per cent worked
12 to 18 hours; and 3 per cent of seafarers worked a typical day of more than
18 hours. As with length of contract and wages, these hours varied according
###### to flag, ship type and crew nationality. The effects of rank and employing
agency are less obvious. In respect of flag, 4 per cent of seafarers reported a
typical working day in excess of 18 hours on FOC-flagged vessels; aboard
nationally flagged vessels 2 per cent reported working these hours. In terms of

117


-----

vessel type, long hours were most often reported on passenger ships and ro-ro
ferries, while seafarers on reefers and bulk carriers reported shorter working
days. Where nationality is concerned, Filipinos, Indonesians and North
Americans were among the seafarers most likely to report working days of
more than 18 hours, with 9 per cent, 8 per cent and 5 per cent respectively
doing so.

###### In the late 1990s, the ITF conducted its own survey of working hours,
collecting questionnaire responses from 2,500 seafarers of 60 different
nationalities, serving under 63 different flags.[37] The results showed working
###### hours were often in excess of the requirements of the ILO Seafarers' Hours of
Work and the Manning of Ships Convention, 1996 (No. 180). Overall, 3 per
cent of seafarers had an average working day of less than eight hours; 65 per
cent worked eight to 12 hours; 27 per cent worked 12 to 15 hours; and 5 per
cent had an average working day of more than 15 hours. There was also
evidence that seafarers work consistently long hours on a regular daily basis.
Sixty-two per cent of seafarers said they worked more than 60 hours per week
and 24 per cent said they worked more than 80 hours per week. Additionally,
60 per cent of seafarers indicated that their working hours had increased in the
past five to ten years, despite the fact that 64 per cent of seafarers said they
were aware of international regulations on working hours.[38]

###### Although wages are a fairly obvious focus for attention, there are other important factors to consider when examining the living and working conditions of seafarers. These include food, accommodation and welfare
provision as well as standards of health and safety, all of which are looked at in
the next chapter on shipboard life and work.

 SHIPBOARD LIFE

 AND WORK-II

A ship's cook ofIndian nationality

###### Food, diet and accommodation

Food in residential institutions often takes on a particular significance, and
this is particularly true for ships' crews.[1] As seafarers are denied many of the
pleasures of their shore-based contemporaries, food can be more important to
###### them than simply satisfying hunger. Food is addressed by the ILO Food and
Catering (Ships' Crews) Convention, 1946 (No. 68), which considers issues
such as supplies, storage and preparation facilities, the training and
qualification of catering crew and "the provision of food and water supplies
which, having regard to the size of the crew and the duration and nature of the
voyage, are suitable in respect of quantity, nutritive value, quality and variety"
(Article 4). The Convention also requires that competent authorities provide
a system of inspection that includes "the qualification of such member of the
catering department of the crew as are required by laws or regulations to
possess prescribed qualifications".

The number of seafarers working in galleys has decreased considerably
over recent years, reflecting cost-cutting efforts and a general trend towards a
###### reduction in crew size. Ships sailing with small crews, such as those mainly
employed in the coastal trades, often have no crew member employed
specifically as cook and, therefore, it is common for shipmasters to buy
supplies in supermarkets and to take turns with other crew members in
cooking the meals. Although cooks are invariably employed in larger ships,
training is not always adequate. A syllabus from a British college that meets

###### present (British) requirements for standards of training and course content for ships' cooks conspicuously lacks any provision for training in nutrition, healthy food preparation and hygienic storage, focusing instead on a limited

The question of food and diet has been given some attention in the cruise
###### sector of the industry, although this has mainly centred on the problems of
gastrointestinal disorders and food poisoning outbreaks among passengers.[2]

There has been no scientific research on the spread and consequences of food-
borne diseases among ships' crews or on the diet of seafarers. The limited data
available do, however, suggest that there are considerable problems with diet
and nutrition. Studies of Danish (male) seafarers report that those over the age
of 34 years are significantly more likely than men in the general population to
be defined as "grossly obese", that is, having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30
###### or above: in the age group 45-54 years, 30 per cent of the seafarers sampled
had a BMI of 30 or above, compared with 6 per cent of men in the general
population.[3] The results of British medical examinations taken throughout
1998 show that obesity is the second most common reason for seafarers to be
issued a restricted certificate and the fifth most common reason for failing a
medical examination.[4]

Seafarers who are issued with a restricted certificate or who have failed a
medical examination because of obesity may go on a "crash diet" in order to
lose weight rapidly. However, crash dieting can be dangerous to a person's
health and the effects are unlikely to be long lasting. Obesity itself also has
severe health consequences: it can lead to hypertension and an increased risk
of coronary heart disease. It is possible that obesity among seafarers has
become an occupational problem. In a study carried out in Australia, seafarers
expressed concern over the large amounts of fried foods in their diet and the
absence of low-fat products on some ships.[5] The study also showed that
seafarers consume significantly more sugar and fat at sea than when they are
ashore, which may reflect a lack of choice and autonomy: the range of food
available to seafarers is subject to decisions made about supplies, as well as the
knowledge, skills and competencies of the cook (if, indeed, there is a cook at
all). Weight problems may also reflect seafarers' more sedentary occupational
demands, owing to increased automation and increased administrative duties,
along with restricted opportunities for physical exercise while aboard. It is also
unclear to what extent "unhealthy choices" reflect a paucity of knowledge
when it comes to nutrition and health. Shore-based research shows that many
men rely on their partners for food purchase and preparation and hence the
provision of a nutritionally balanced meal.[6] However, knowledge is useless if
it cannot be operationalized and, as noted earlier, seafarers often have little
choice in the matter.

The choices seafarers make about what they eat may also reflect more
complex issues, such as changes in eating patterns related to working shifts. A
###### consistent finding of research with shiftworkers in shore-based occupations is that they complain more than other workers of gastrointestinal digestive

123

###### symptoms.[7] Working shifts has been found to have an effect on the regularity
and number of meals eaten,[8] and night shiftwork has also been associated with
increases in "snacking" and "nibbling".[9] Research with ferry-workers working
irregular shift patterns shows that they are often dissatisfied with their eating
###### patterns and have problems adjusting meal routines to changes in shift.[1][0] For those seafarers with longer tours of duty, problems can be exacerbated by the
lack of autonomy associated with the range of food, preparation and
availability while aboard. Those seafarers who are working traditional watch
###### hours and, therefore, missing conventional meal times, may find their choices
limited to what is available at their breaks. Long irregular working hours may
also affect eating habits. Research with shore-side workers in Japan has shown
###### that there is a positive correlation between working extra overtime and
increases in BMI and waist circumference.[11] Thus the very nature of seafaring
###### work patterns while aboard may be detrimental to healthy eating, with the subsequent implications for health.

Food consumption also has social implications. Shared meal times provide
a crucial opportunity for social contact at sea. Now that almost all ships have
small crews and operate to tighter deadlines, seafarers frequently experience
periods of isolation and loneliness. Modern seafarers often work alone or in
###### conditions that prohibit conversation. After work they may be too tired to take
advantage of whatever opportunities to socialize exist. Research with Finnish
seafarers has shown that the most common leisure activity while aboard is
reading, with less than 40 per cent reporting "chatting with friends" as a way of
spending their free time.[1][2] Communal meals can be one of the few oppor-
###### tunities that seafarers have to spend time together, thus promoting social
solidarity and a sense of camaraderie, which is so vital for emotional well-being.
Reductions in crewing levels have led to suggestions that communal meals
###### prepared by specialist galley crews should be replaced with self-service meals to
be taken according to individual needs and work patterns. Aside from the
###### nutritional implications of such proposals, the repercussions on social contact
aboard and the subsequent effect on seafarer well-being could be considerable.

###### The importance of seafarers' working conditions in respect of recruitment and retention,[13] social cohesion and welfare on board[14] and crew
efficiency[15] has been recognized for some time, and it has been argued that
standards of shipboard accommodation need to be "very much in advance" of
###### those ashore to attract sufficient numbers of people to a seafaring career.[16]

Naval architects have asserted that shipowners are "morally obligated" to
ensure that accommodation aboard offers seafarers a "high standard of
###### comfort" and that "there is a responsibility on people who proscribe the conditions in which others live to give careful attention not only to their
safety and comfort but also to the state of mind which an environment

###### inculcates".[1][7] Reduced crewing levels and single-person tasking have
minimized opportunities for social contact aboard, accommodation structures
###### that include separate leisure areas for different crew members have
compounded this. Designs that maximize casual interaction between seafarers
while also providing private space for individuals have been regarded as
desirable.[1][8] Such favourable accommodation and leisure facilities on board
have been seen to play an important role in the social organization of the ship
and subsequently on its operational efficiency.[1][9] Indeed, it has been claimed
###### that capital outlay which improves efficiency through crew contentment
should be regarded as a contribution to economic success.[20]

Despite the recognition in the literature of the importance of high-
quality accommodation, standards vary considerably from ship to ship. At
best, ships have single-berth accommodation for all crew members, with en
suite bath and toilet facilities, adequate space for storage, desks or tables,
comfortable seating, air conditioning/heating, good lighting and ventilation.
Officers are allocated larger rooms or a suite of two rooms with separate living
###### or sleeping areas and refrigerators. Laundry facilities include a sufficient number of washing machines, dryers and irons. The minimum standards of accommodation are laid down in a number of international labour
Conventions: the Food and Catering (Ships' Crews) Convention, 1946 (No.
68); the Accommodation of Crews Convention (Revised), 1949 (No. 92); and
the Accommodation of Crews (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1970
(No. 133); and certain Recommendations.

Ships that are owned and/or managed by shipowners of the north
European States (Nordic ships are particularly likely to fall into this category),
Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States tend to have high standards
of accommodation. Although newer ships are generally considered to have
###### better leisure and recreational facilities, the age of the vessel is not necessarily
an accurate guide to standards of accommodation or other facilities. There are
reports, for example, that some newer ships have poor sound insulation
between rooms, use cheaper and less robust materials in accommodation areas
and suffer from excessive and continuous vibration.

###### It is difficult to make generalizations on the quality of accommodation.
There is, however, some evidence that reefers, tankers and container ships are
more likely to have reasonable standards of accommodation than ferries,
cruise ships and bulk carriers. The reasons for this relate not only to notions
of benevolence or "good" and "bad" employers but more to market and
operational considerations. To some extent, container ships that operate on
fixed routes are protected from competition because they have grouped
themselves into conferences, which operate rather like cartels. They are
consequently under less pressure to cut costs than, for instance, bulker

owners. They can, therefore, afford to offer seafarers better standards of
accommodation. Owners of ferries and cruise ships, which, like bulkers, also
operate in a highly competitive environment, are particularly concerned with
limiting the space (and therefore the facilities) available to seafarers because of
its opportunity cost. Even the most luxurious of the cruise industry's vessels
provide relatively poor standards of crew accommodation. In some vessels,
cabins can be hot and noisy, with exposed pipework running along deck-heads.
Seafarers have little space and furniture: sometimes just one small fixed locker
###### per person in cabins for up to four people.

Whatever their motivation, many shipowners and designers have taken
the provision of high standards in accommodation and recreational facilities
seriously and appreciate that, as one author has pointed out, "an essential
###### prerequisite to a seaman's health, in addition to his personal comfort, dignity
and welfare, is that he has adequate accommodation".[21] Nevertheless, some
seafarers continue to live in poor conditions. In too many ships, cabins are
cramped and shared, badly lit and ventilated, and often infested with pests,
such as cockroaches. There are frequently no recreational facilities (apart from
a television perhaps), toilet facilities are shared and basic standards of hygiene
are not met. These ships are more likely to be ferries, older generation bulk
carriers and general cargo ships that do not operate on international routes.
However, there are also many vessels operating internationally that fail to
###### conform to the relevant ILO standards (tables 5.1 and 5.2).

Despite the provisions of Conventions Nos. 68 (Article 5) and 92, which
are included in the Appendix to the Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards)
###### Convention, 1976 [and Protocol, 1996] (No. 147), and later supplementary
provisions on accommodation of crews in Convention No. 133, standards of
###### food and accommodation have not been always a priority of PSC inspectors.
With the adoption of Convention No. 147 in 1976, ratifying States could apply
the standards of Conventions No. 92 and Article 5 of No. 68 to all ships
visiting their ports, regardless of their origin or "flag". For the first time, sub-
###### standard vessels could be detained for failing to comply with international
minimum labour standards. Following the signing of the Paris MOU on PSC,
issues relating to food and accommodation were accorded greater attention. In
particular, a three-month concentrated campaign of inspectors was carried out
in the autumn of 1997; during this period, nearly 4,000 vessels were inspected
###### for living and working conditions. Although 54 per cent of deficiencies
concerning accommodation and a 120 per cent rise in deficiencies concerning
###### food and catering were reported, the number of detentions remained low: it is
still unusual for a ship to be detained on the grounds of deficiencies in
###### accommodation and catering alone. The value of inspections should not,
however, be underestimated. Deficiencies have to be put right and increasing

126

the number of follow-up inspections should result in improvements being
made on ships.

Although most ships are not detained solely on the grounds of sub-
standard food and accommodation, there are numerous examples, in almost any
given month, of vessels that are detained for these reasons among others. The
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines-flagged 12,000 grt bulk carrier, Leader, was
detained in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1996 for 101 days for structural deficiencies
and "unsanitary conditions in accommodation". In November 1995, the 39,865
dwt Maltese-flagged, Atlantic Sea, was detained in Milton Haven, England, with
a number of deficiencies, including "severe cockroach infestation" and "rotten
food". The 1976-built, 70,633 gt Liberian-flagged tanker, Mystras II, was
detained on 19 October 1999 by the United States PSC for numerous
deficiencies, including "accommodation spaces infested with roaches, and
###### numerous toilets, showers and sinks ... [that were] inoperable".[22] An
examination of the declarations from PSC published in Lloyd's List highlights
the extent of the problem: in the randomly selected month of July 1999, the
details of the following vessels detained by the PSC for reasons including poor
(usually unsanitary) accommodation and catering provisions were printed:

       - Heng Ya, a 1,691 gt Belize-flagged general cargo ship, built in 1993;

       - Mailicia, a 7,142 gt Cyprus-flagged reefer, built in 1980;

       - Marmara, a 3,712 gt Ukraine-flagged general cargo ship, built in 1973;

      - Osman Er, an 8,400 gt Turkish bulk carrier, built in 1980;

       - Swan, a 1,865 gt Honduras-flagged general cargo ship, built in 1964.

Given the likely under-reporting of deficiencies in accommodation and
###### food and the reluctance of PSC inspectors to detain ships, it is perhaps
surprising to find as many ships detained on these (among other) grounds.
However, other sources also suggest that there is still a significant problem in
terms of food and accommodation, which needs to be addressed by the
industry. Of 9,324 vessels detained in 1997, 406 were detained for deficiencies
in accommodation (table 5.1, column C).

Table 5.2 shows the number of deficiencies for ILO-related matters
found in four years by the Paris MOU States. On average, about 10 per cent
of all deficiencies (not all the categories have been listed in the table) are
related to crew and conditions of work, and of these approximately half are
concerned with issues of accommodation and food and catering. It should be
###### noted, however, that issues such as articles of agreement, employment contracts and other matters that PSC authorities do not verify have not been
included, although they are part of Convention No. 147.

###### It would seem reasonable to conclude, therefore, that there are
significant numbers of ships that fail to provide even basic standards of
###### accommodation and catering to their crews and that there are many more
ships, which, while their provisions may not be particularly hazardous to
health, do not provide reasonable standards of food and/or accommodation to
seafarers. Although there has been a great deal of speculation within the
###### industry about whether or not the transfer of ships to open registries has led to a decline in standards, the limited evidence available here suggests that the
flag of the ship is not necessarily an indication of the standards of food and
###### accommodation aboard. In 1950, an ILO report on conditions aboard
Panamanian ships considered that ownership was, in fact, a better guide to
standards, and it appears that little has changed:

The conditions of safety and employment in the ships it saw depended largely on
the owners, agents and masters. There are owners who, because of their national
traditions or their sense of responsibility, see to it that their ships are seaworthy
and comply with good standards of safety and employment conditions. There are
others who are apparently irresponsible and looking solely for quick profits and
are prepared on that account to take risks as to the safety of passengers and crew
and apply the lowest standards of employment that the crew (often in the grip of
circumstances and prepared to accept any job rather than be unemployed) will
tolerate.[23]

Table 5.1 shows that many detentions apply to a number of flag States of
all types, including national flags. In fact, many companies with reputations
for high standards have flagged out, but nevertheless continued to maintain

130

Shipboard life and work                                  - II

excellent standards of food and accommodation on their ships. With regard to
food, catering and accommodation, it might be appropriate for PSC inspectors
###### to target those fleets of owners who are recurring offenders and submit them to frequent inspections. Where ships have been detained, follow-up
inspections should be made to ensure that deficiencies have been corrected.

###### Occupational safety

Seafaring remains a high risk occupation: for example, fatal injuries and
drownings among Danish seafarers from 1986 to 1993 were 11.5 times higher
###### than average rates among the Danish male workforce ashore.[24] Similarly, in
England and Wales, the latest available official statistics on work-related
fatalities show that seafarers' mortality rates for water transport accidents are
higher than train drivers' rates for railway accidents and truck drivers' rates for
traffic accidents, despite the likely undercounting of some British seafarer
deaths occurring outside British waters on non-British registered ships.
###### Among transport workers, only aircraft flight deck officers have higher fatal
accident rates.[25] A 1986 ILO survey of 1,600 seafarer fatalities in 30 countries
over a 12-month period estimated that at least 36 per cent of those deaths were
occupationally related.[26]

###### Although an International Ship Information Database has recently been
set up within the IMO, there is at present no shipping equivalent of the
###### International Civil Aviation Organization's regular published analyses of global
aviation industry deaths. A method for analysing casualties was finally agreed
###### by the IMO at the end of 2000, but reports depend on casualty investigations
being conducted by the flag State, not all of whom have the capacity or are
willing to conduct thorough, professional investigations. Although the IMO
database may well become an important research resource in the future, at
###### present most of the (limited) research evidence on work-related fatalities and non-fatal injuries relates to seafarers from the developed world: the frag- mentary research evidence from the developing world points to significantly
higher fatality rates. Thus, a comparison of occupational mortality over 15 years
in the British-, Hong Kong- and Singapore-registered merchant fleets showed
###### that Asian seafarers had occupational accident mortality rates 2.4 times (in the
case of the Singaporeans) and 2.0 times (in the case of the Hong Kong crews)
greater than those of seafarers on British-registered ships,[27] with many more
Asian deaths due to foundering and grounding.

In the absence of any comprehensive international reports, the best
international dataset is probably that provided by the United Kingdom P&I
###### Club's ten-year analysis of major claims,[28] since the club's membership
accounts for 20 per cent of the world's deep-water fleet and covers all major

131


-----

The global seafarer

ship types. However, the P&I Club analysis of personal injuries and fatalities
is, of course, limited to claims data and to those claims exceeding $100,000.
###### Over the period 1987-97, an initial rise in claims in the late 1980s was followed
by a fall in the number of major claims over the 1990s, with claims due to "ship
failure" falling more rapidly than claims due to "human error". Some types of
ship are over-represented in claims: not surprisingly, passenger ships accounted
###### for a disproportionate number of personal injury claims, as did rig and supply
ships, but the incidence of claims from the latter is falling. Data on cargo-
carrying vessels from the Lloyd's Register of Shipping World Casualty Statistics
###### show that 5,962 seafarer lives were lost at sea in the ten-year period 1989-99.[29]
 Considering these data in conjunction with world fleet crewing data,[30] evidence
suggests that fatality rates vary by ship type. For example, in 1998, 20 per cent
of the world's seafarers were employed on oil tankers, yet only 1.2 per cent of
fatalities in this period occurred on vessels of this type. The United Kingdom
###### P&I Club's analysis found ship failure to be greatest among a cohort of ships built between 1973 and 1978 and among ships from certain flag States (the
Bahamas, Cyprus, Malta, Panama, Romania, the United States and, since 1993,
the Russian Federation).[31] A British study of mortality showed that 40 per cent
of British seafarers' deaths on FOC ships were due to occupational injuries and
maritime disasters, whereas on British-registered ships such deaths accounted
###### for only 15 per cent of the total.[32] "Human error" should not imply blame- worthy behaviour where it arises out of commercial pressures, falling crewing
levels and turnaround times, inadequate training, excessive hours, fatigue and
so on (see the section on occupational health below). Major claims of the
###### United Kingdom P&I Club due to "human error" fell in the 1990s; the fall was
especially steep in respect of crew and deck officer error, the likely reason being
the downward trend in numbers of officers and crew in the same period, with
a consequent overall reduction in personal injury.[33] "Human error" claims were
###### disproportionately high in respect of medium-sized bulk carriers, probably
reflecting trading patterns (with a greater likelihood of shorter voyages and
more frequent berthing, discharging and loading).[34] A 1993 Japan Maritime
Research Institute (JAMRI) report suggested that 53 per cent of casualties
from grounding and 38 per cent of casualties from collisions were due to "less
alert lookouts" and "dozing off during navigation";[35] in the United Kingdom,
the Donaldson inquiry[36] suggested that fatigue was the primary, or a major
###### contributory, cause of 70 to 80 per cent of marine pollution-causing accidents.
 National occupational accident reporting schemes are subject to under- reporting and reporting bias, but analyses of such data can nevertheless be
instructive. Hansen et al.[37] analysed the data on more than 2,000 reported
accidents aboard Danish-registered merchant ships: fatal accidents and those
causing permanent disabilities are most common on coasters and ro-ros, occur

Box 5.2 The near grounding of the Kotuku tanker (off Cape Kidnappers,

North Island, New Zealand, November 1997)

While the ship was in Wellington Harbour, extra work was created by the need to
change berths before discharging was completed. On leaving Wellington, the ship ran
into heavy seas. The 02:00 hours position of the ship was misread and wrongly plotted
on the chart by the 2nd officer, who had been on duty for 11 hours in the previous
24-hour period; he did not check the position independently. On the next watch, the
1 st officer perpetuated this mistake every half hour for the next four hours; he did not
check the position independently. The 1 st officer had been suffering from tonsillitis for
the past year. An operation to remove his tonsils had been scheduled for the previous
week but had been postponed because the tanker company was unable to find
anyone to relieve him. In the 24 hour period prior to the incident, the 1st Officer had
been on duty for 15 hours. The day before that, he had been on duty for 12 and a half
hours out of the 24. The officer on the next watch obtained a radar echo of land on
the starboard side of the ship and brought it to the attention of the master, who altered
course. In an interview immediately after the incident, the 1 st officer said that he "was
tired and the watch seemed like being in a fog". The investigator recommended that
the certificates of the 1st and 2nd officers be suspended.

more frequently to ratings than to officers, and most frequently during the
earlier part of the seafarer's trip (suggesting that unfamiliarity with tasks or
environment may play a role in occupational injuries).

Fatigue can be attributed to many factors: the voyage cycle, the sea state,
noise, vibration, climate, functional shipboard role and crewing levels (box 5.2).
Changes in technology may also be contributing to a new source of seafarer
fatigue: crews operating catamaran-designed fast ferries report additional
fatigue (owing to the uneven acceleration to vertical and lateral movement) and
drowsiness (owing to the fact that they are regularly taking medication to
###### counter motion sickness).[38] Fatigue is likely to be less of a problem on long-
haul ships and more of a problem on near-sea trade ships with their short
passages, numerous port calls and small crews. The fact that at least one oil
major will not hire any ships where the master keeps a watch may well
exemplify a widespread problem in near-sea traders. A recent review of the
literature on fatigue, health and injury among seafarers found that the risk of
accidents occurring was greatest during the early hours of the morning; that
environmental factors were related to sleep disturbances, fatigue and stress; that
###### motion adversely affected cognitive and psychomotor performance; that
seafarers reported higher levels of anxiety, greater workload, dissatisfaction
###### with shift levels and sleep problems; and that circadian adaptation could only
partially be achieved, at best, on four-on/eight-off shift patterns.[39]

###### Equipment failure was estimated to cause around 20 per cent of accidents to seafarers in an earlier ILO review.[40] In some areas of shipboard activity, the proportion of accidents attributed to equipment failure is very much greater:
an international survey conducted by the ICS and the OCIMF found that 70
###### per cent of accidents associated with the lifeboat drills and launchings were
caused by equipment failure.[41] On British-flagged ships alone, in a ten-year
###### period there were 12 deaths and 87 injuries involving lifeboats and their
launching systems.[42] One area in which equipment currently appears to be
inadequate is that of wharf/gangplank/vessel perimeter barriers. National data
from Australia,[43] Denmark[44] and the United Kingdom[45] all show very high
rates of off-duty fatal injuries (the crews of British-registered vessels appear to
suffer higher rates of fatal injuries off duty than on), but the most common
cause of off-duty fatalities is that of falls into docks and rivers when returning
###### to a berthed vessel from shore. Many of these falls are alcohol-related, but they only had fatal consequences because of inadequate and hazardous access
arrangements. Fatal shipboard falls into holds and so on occur frequently, but
many fatal and non-fatal injuries are sustained by falls down stairways in ship
###### accommodation and engine-room areas. It is likely that falls are exacerbated
by the steepness of ships' stairways, which typically have had steeper angles of
###### inclination than the domestic and industrial norm (despite regulatory
changes).[46] Poor physical working conditions (excessive noise, vibration and
heat) contribute to accidents[47] as well as fatigue brought about by long
###### working hours and disturbed patterns of sleep due to shiftwork.[48]

Injuries caused by exposure to chemicals remain common among
seafarers. A total of 177 such injuries and fatalities were reported to the
###### Danish maritime authorities between 1988 to 1996, from a fleet of
approximately 800 ships crewed by about 9,500 seafarers. Eye injuries were
particularly common, especially those due to exposure to caustic soda and
cleaning detergents.[49]

###### Occupational health

 Health surveys of workforces tend to show lower levels of morbidity (the
incidence or prevalence of a disease or diseases in a population) than surveys
of general populations. This is known to epidemiologists as the "healthy
###### worker effect" and is a consequence of unhealthy and incapacitated individuals
leaving the workforce or being prevented from joining it. Effective health
surveys require the long-term follow-up of a cohort of seafarers over time,
including those leaving the shipping industry; no such longitudinal surveys,
however, exist.

The healthy worker effect can be expected to be strong in an occupation
such as seafaring that has mandatory periodic medical examinations designed
###### to screen out people with incapacities or chronic health problems: in 1998,
25,438 seafarers underwent medical examinations conducted by the United
Kingdom's approved medical examiners, of which 672 seafarers failed their
medicals and 2,172 seafarers were issued with restricted certificates; in the
same year, there were 90 appeals but only 11 of these resulted in the seafarer
being declared fit.[50] Similarly, analyses of death certification data by the
occupation of the deceased tend to understate deaths to those in physically
demanding jobs, since unfit people tend to leave such occupations early to take
up more sedentary jobs before their deaths; in the case of seafarers, death
certification data are also thought to be subject to a degree of undercounting,
since a certain number of deaths occur abroad.[51] All these reasons would lead
one to assume that seafarers' morbidity and mortality rates would be relatively
low; in fact, reported levels are surprisingly high.

In respect of morbidity, the United Kingdom P&I Club reports rising
numbers of repatriation and illness claims (with costs per claim averaging
between $10,000 and $25,000),[52] and enhanced medical surveys of seafarers
###### detect substantial morbidity among many seafarers who would probably have
been passed fit at the standard examination. An enhanced examination was
###### conducted on 977 Filipino crew in 1996/7, utilizing tests for blood count, liver function, hepatitis B, malaria, lung function and an electrocardiogram (ECG),
at a cost of $80: it was found that 9.6 per cent of the crews were unfit, mostly
because of abnormal liver function, hepatitis B or high blood pressure.[53] In a
###### study of 135 Finnish pilots aged over 45, the results of physical examinations
(mimicking the periodic medical examination) were compared with an
enhanced examination using blood analyses, chest X-rays and exercise-ECG:
many more cases of cardiovascular disease were detected in the latter
examinations and the authors concluded that "the current periodic health
examination does not seem to effectively prevent a person with a possible
health defect from working as a sea pilot".[54] A major difficulty here is the fact
###### that in most countries the approved medical practitioners who conduct these
periodic examinations are typically general practitioners who have no direct
access to specialized equipment or laboratories. For example, ILO/WHO
guidelines lay down minimum in-service hearing standards: at least 30 decibels
(dB), unaided, in the better ear and 40 dB, unaided, in the other ear within the
frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 Hz, at distances of 3 metres and 2
metres respectively.[55] However, audiometric testing requires a soundproof
###### room, to which general practitioners rarely have access. Nevertheless,
substantial levels of serious morbidity are going undetected under the present
system. Of the 672 seafarers who failed their British examinations in 1998, for

example, 98 had hypertension, 62 had ischaemic heart disease, 54 diabetes, 32
asthma, 24 were alcohol dependent, 14 suffered from acute psychosis and 15
suffered from loss of hearing.[56]

###### In respect of mortality, Britain's Occupational Health Decennial
Supplement data for 1995 can be taken as typical of seafarers' mortality data in
the developed world, with British seafarers having high mortality rates for
cancers (of the oral cavity, the pharynx, the liver and larynx), cirrhosis,
pancreatitis and "other alcohol-related diseases". The editor commented that
the findings were consistent with those in previous decennial supplements and
"reflect unusually high consumption of alcohol among seafarers".[57] However,
it should be pointed out that, although alcohol consumption undoubtedly
plays a part, the possible role of hepatitis B and C in generating high rates of
liver disease among seafarers has not yet been properly examined, although
###### fragmentary data are already available showing high prevalences of hepatitis B
in some national seafaring populations.[58] Cardiovascular diseases can be
expected to be a common cause of death among seafarers in the developed
###### world, although cardiovascular deaths are also common among some
developing world seafaring populations, such as Indian ratings.[59] Suicide rates
are reported to be high among seafarers from some OECD countries such as
Britain[60] and Denmark,[61] compared with other occupational groups, although
suicides are not confined to the crews of the industrialized world: for example,
14 of 449 recorded deaths of Indian seafarers in the period 1990-96 have been
###### attributed to suicide.[62]

Exposure to toxic and carcinogenic materials is also responsible for a
significant number of deaths and acute and chronic illnesses. The Norwegian
###### Cancer Research Institute has found that mesothelioma deaths are six times
more common among Norwegian ships' engineers and engine ratings than
among the general population,[63] as a likely consequence of the crew being
exposed to asbestos in the past. Shipping companies are now reported to be
facing a flood of claims as a result of negligence in exposing employees to
asbestos dust in the 1950s and 60s.[64] Seafarers have also been found to have a
significantly greater risk of getting gastric cancer, which has been attributed to
over-exposure to certain chemicals, including nitrogen oxides and mineral
dusts.[65] Among Danish seafarers, cancers are more common among the engine
###### than deck crew.[66] Research has also shown increases in the incidence of skin
cancers among younger seafarers.[6][7] Tanker crews are known to have
particularly high rates of lung cancer, urogenital cancer[68] and leukaemia[69]

because of their exposure to various carcinogenic agents, most notably
benzene, but also to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds and
###### organic lead compounds. Although new international regulations and
technological improvements have undoubtedly reduced exposure to chemicals

136

Shipboard life and work                                  - II

among tanker crews, shipboard studies indicate that levels of benzene
exposure may still be too high.[70] Benzene exposure may also affect the central
nervous system; central nervous system symptoms reported by individuals
have been associated with high benzene exposure levels among tanker crews.[71]

Seafarers are also exposed to physical hazards to their health, particularly
noise and vibration but also excessive heat and cold and harmful radiation
from sunlight. The 1993 Joint ILO/WHO Committee on the Health of
Seafarers stated that engine-room noise levels sometimes exceed 100 dB and
living quarters noise sometimes exceeds 60 dB,[72] which can have an impact on
a person's hearing, alertness and mental health. Measured noise levels on a
range of Polish merchant ships have been shown to exceed acceptable levels for
engine crews by an average of 1-2 dB, while audiometric testing at the
beginning and end of voyages has revealed statistically significant temporary
shifts in hearing thresholds, with the shift being more pronounced among
engine-room crews.[73] Furthermore, shipboard performance testing has shown
###### that crews subjected to high noise levels demonstrate slower reaction times
and more lapses of attention.[74]

Ergonomie hazards increase the risk of injury and of musculo-skeletal
disease. Seafarers are particularly susceptible to back injuries: the motion of
the ship is counteracted by movement in the lumbar region, and back strain
can also be exacerbated by holding and lifting loads in pitching seas.[75] The
uneven acceleration rate in fast ferries results in a specific type of ship
movement which induces a high level of sea-sickness and extreme physical
tiredness.[76] Crews on such vessels have been reported to take large doses of
sea-sickness medication, often for prolonged periods. Little is known about
the health consequences of taking high levels of such medication long term;
however, the short-term effects of drowsiness and lethargy are well-
###### documented[77] and have been reported by fast ferry crew, along with
subsequent concerns regarding a lowering of performance levels, particularly
in emergency situations.

Seafarers are susceptible to infectious diseases, both as a result of shore
and shipboard exposure. It is claimed that seafarers from industrialized
countries have the highest prevalence of infectious diseases. Like other
###### transport workers, and migrant workers, seafarers have high rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs): a 1991 review of studies on STDs among
seafarers showed that rates of gonorrhoea in different national groups of
seafarers were between five and 20 times as great as national average
prevalences for males.[78] Prior infection with STDs (such as gonorrhoea and
chancroid) is known to increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) transmission.

The global seafarer

A recent paper on the sexual health of women seafarers aboard cruise
ships reported that heterosexual relationships are a common feature of
###### shipboard life but that restricted, and frequently non-confidential, access to
ships' doctors is possibly making it difficult for women to obtain prescription
contraceptives and for STDs to be diagnosed and treated. It was recommended
###### that preboarding induction courses on sexual health and on the sexual risks for
crews be introduced.[79]

Lifestyle studies show that seafarers are more likely than the general
###### population to engage in a range of unhealthy behavioural habits. For example,
a recent study of 1,806 Australian seafarers[80] showed that, compared with
surveys of the Australian general public, seafarers smoke and drink more,
exercise less and consume more sugar and fat. Danish seafarers have been
###### found to smoke considerably more than the general population and those aged
over 34 years are significantly more likely to be obese.[81] Female Danish
seafarers have been found to adopt the same lifestyle of their male colleagues:
###### they have a high risk of fatal accidents and suicide and an increased risk of
dying of lung cancer and heart diseases, both of which probably reflect high
tobacco consumption.[82]

###### Only comparatively recently has the mental health of seafarers started to
receive the attention it deserves. High seafarer suicide rates have already been
###### mentioned, but poor mental health can manifest itself in much less dramatic
ways. Among the seafarers in the 1997 Australian study, 60 per cent reported
###### moderate to high stress levels and 70 per cent reported poor quality sleep at
sea, with masters, mates and pilots reporting higher incidences of stress, and
pilots reporting the worst sleep quality.[83] Direct measurement (using wrist-
###### worn actimeters) of sleep quality at sea and on shore among the crew of a European passenger ferry showed that seafarers working split shift patterns
experienced the worst sleep disturbances.[84] The irregular shift patterns of
marine pilots have been found to lead to stress-related difficulties, including
social and domestic problems.[85] Ferry crews working to erratic schedules have
been reported to take significantly more days off sick, have poorer sleep
###### patterns and more consultations for insomnia than those working more
predictable schedules.[86] High levels of stress have been reported by crews on
vessels in the Finnish merchant fleet. Stress was found to be most strongly
###### connected to work-related factors, including noise, occupation on board and unfair distribution of workload. An important predictor of both stress and
depression was worry about loved ones ashore (box 5.3).[87] In the Australian
study, the "home-work interface" was the highest ranked source of stress for
all seafaring groups,[88] while a parallel Australian study of the wives and families
of Great Barrier Reef pilots found that pilotage work had an impact on the
mental health of the pilots' wives, with 14 per cent being assessed as having

Box 5.3 "I could have quite easily jumped over the side"

I used to cry on the ship. I used to sit there, I used to lie there and I used to work out
what I was going to say. You know, when I get home this time, I'm going to tell them

[the children], I'm going to explain it and I used to cry on the ship. I knew I couldn't
do it. I was quite suicidal a couple of times. I could have quite easily jumped over the
side on a couple of occasions, I was so, I was so down. [. . .] Once I mean, you
know, I walked down to the end of the ship and I was just standing on the end and
I, it was about 10 o'clock at night, nobody would have noticed. I'd gone to bed. You
know, we'd had a few drinks in the bar. I'd gone up to the cabin. Nobody would have
missed me.

British chief engineer talking about his feelings on his divorce while aboard ship

It's very easy when you're working in an engine room. There are two points in the day
where you actively have to come back and that's for a smoke at 10 o'clock and at 3
o'clock, so at those points that's all there is. No one has to know, it's very easy to sit
there and cry your eyes out if you wanted to. There are so many spaces where
people don't go to very often. The engine room is very noisy, so you can scream your
head off and somebody standing next to you would still have a job hearing you.

high anxiety levels and 9 per cent being depressed, higher prevalences than
would be found in a normal population sample.[89]

The medical examination for seafarers includes an assessment of mental
health. Acute psychosis, persistent alcohol abuse (dependency), a history of
drug or substance abuse in the past five years and chronic or recurrent neurosis
all lead to a seafarer being assessed as permanently unfit for sea duty.[90]

Seafarers suffering from neuroses that are neither chronic nor recurrent can
be assessed as temporally unfit, and this assessment is reviewed after a number
of weeks.[91] The data from the 1998 medical examinations of British-
based practitioners showed that mental health problems accounted for
approximately one in ten medical examination failures: 70 of the 672 failures
in this period were due to mental disorders. It is unclear how effective the
medical examination is at screening for psychological health. However, the
high rates of suicide among seafarers suggest that a significant number of
mental health problems may still be going undetected.

Changes in working conditions can effect the psychological well-being of
seafarers. In particular, reduced crewing levels and the rise in single-person
tasking can lead to isolation problems.[92] Research has shown that marginality
is a central feature of a seafarer's lifestyle.[93] A study of Danish seafarers found
###### that nearly half (47 per cent) of those working on cargo ships and almost a

139


-----

###### third (28 per cent) of those working on passenger ships experienced a feeling
of loneliness "often" or "sometimes". This can also extend to leisure time
while aboard. Research on the free-time leisure activities of Finnish seafarers
aboard cargo ships showed that most of the seafarers spent their leisure time
alone, the most popular activity aboard being reading. Those seafarers who
###### pursued "sociable" activities aboard were found to be less likely than others to
suffer from anxiety or depression.[94] Problems of social isolation may be
exacerbated for female seafarers in the predominantly male domain of cargo
shipping, where sexual harassment is a common problem.[95]

The traumatic nature of many incidents at sea, whether these relate to
vessel casualties, acts of piracy, accidents and injuries or the death of a crew
member, is scarcely acknowledged in the literature or research. It is likely,
however, that witnessing or experiencing such incidents can potentially have a
negative impact on a person's mental health. It has been suggested that
shipping companies would benefit from adopting a model of critical incident
stress debriefing (CISD), a method successfully used to reduce suffering from
###### stress-related ailments such as insomnia, depression and anger.[96]

Shipboard medical care is normally provided by fellow seafarers who have
###### undergone paramedic training courses. Although some trainees receive
training of a high standard, an international investigation of training standards
has shown considerable cross-national variations in standards.[97] Furthermore,
the prescribed international training standards were not being effectively
enforced, and it was believed that seafarers were not receiving the same quality
of care as people in land-based occupations. Access to health care can even be
###### restricted for those crews sailing with qualified medical professionals.
Research with seafarers on cruise vessels has found that access to the ship's
###### doctor can be limited, particularly for lower ranking crew.[98] Concern has also
been expressed about the range of medical supplies aboard ship, and the
absence of basic equipment and drugs for life-threatening emergencies on
passenger ferries.[99] Reduced access to professional medical care and supplies
can have dramatic consequences. An analysis of the records held by the
Singapore Mercantile Marine Office on death by disease on board Singapore
ships found that radio medical advice was sought in only two of the total 69
cases. Eight of those who had died on board had seen a doctor and been
declared fit, which suggests deficiencies in port medical services or pressures
###### on port doctors to avoid costly repatriations.[1][00]

An absentfather's instructions
to bis young daughter

###### Introduction

A seafarer is a peculiar animal. He is a stranger when he comes ashore and is the
odd man out in almost any situation. We cater for the loneliness of the seafarer       -
that might sum the whole thing up. When you come home, you stick out like a
sore thumb        - the world has gone on without you and it is not going to stop to fit
you into it. Often, this is part of the loneliness of seafarers. A man goes to sea, he
begins to look forward to coming home. He begins to wish his time away at sea;
that's a dangerous thing for a man to do. He is in danger of losing his soul, I would
say        - his sense of being. He comes ashore and it's fiesta time for him and nobody
else. All too often the leave you look forward to falls flat on its face.

###### One thing all seafarers have in common, regardless of rank, nationality or trade,
is the fact that their work separates them from their families. Seafarers' families
are an important but neglected aspect of seafaring. Family members, including
parents, siblings, partners, children and extended family, can all have an impact
###### on the experiences of seafarers and on the decisions they make during their
maritime career. Families can have a significant effect on a person's entry into the
industry. For example, research on women seafarers has found that, for many, the
decision to embark upon a career at sea was precipitated by having a seafaring
relative.[2] Some families provide initial financial assistance for maritime education
and training and may economically facilitate a seafarer's departures to sea.[3] When

The global seafarer

the seafarer is at sea, families can give a sense of purpose and meaning to a
seafarer's life and work aboard ship.[4] They provide seafarers with an important
source of contact and communication during long tours of duty and a base to
###### return to during their leave periods. Families can also play a decisive role in a
seafarer's length of service: separation from family has been found to be one of
the most stressful aspects of a seafarer's life and can have a strong influence on
###### whether a seafarer stays at sea or not.[5]
 Despite the evidence of the importance of the family in seafarers'
maritime careers, seafarers' family relations, the role of the family and the
experiences of seafarers' partners and family members have largely been
neglected as a topic of maritime research and literature. Drawing on the little
research there is as well as accounts of seafarers and their families, this chapter
looks specifically at these issues. It begins with an examination of the
experiences of seafarers and their families, both when the seafarer is at sea and
ashore. It then goes on to consider the impact of intermittent separation on
seafarers' health and safety and on the health of their partners. Social isolation
and the importance of the family as a means of social support are then looked
at, followed by a discussion of ship-shore communication and its role in
###### promoting and sustaining family life. The final section of this chapter examines
company policies and their impact on the career and family life of seafarers.[6]

###### Seafarers and their families

The demands of paid employment invariably (although not exclusively)
require workers to be separated from their families. Seafarers are not unusual
in this. However, such separations can become significant when considerable
###### portions of time are spent away from partners and families. For seafarers,
ratios of leave to work vary, but even under the most favourable employment
###### conditions seafarers are likely to spend at least six months of any year at sea. For seafarers in weaker labour market positions, spending ten months or more
working aboard ship, with only a couple of months (unpaid) leave before
###### returning to sea, is not unusual. Such patterns of work inevitably have an
impact on family life, while prolonged absences from families correspondingly
affect seafarers' experiences of their work.

The stresses suffered by seafarers as a result of being away from home
and their families have been documented in the research literature (see the
section in this chapter on health and safety).[7] These strains can, in part, reflect
the emotional consequences of being separated from close family members.
Seafarers can also be anxious about matters relating to family members, such
as worries about chronically ill loved ones, the sexual fidelity of a partner, or
the problematic behaviour of a disruptive child. Such anxieties can take on

146

Seafarers families

increased significance when the seafarer is physically absent for considerable
periods of time, and may be heightened by restricted opportunities to
communicate frequently enough with those ashore (see the section on ship-
shore communication). In addition, seafarers may be worried about their
family's general well-being and the day-to-day running of practical household
matters in their absence. Seafarers recognize the demands of such periods of
separation on their partners and on the importance of having a "good
seafarer's wife" (typically described as "independent" and "able to cope"), who
can manage the home and family for prolonged periods alone. As one senior
officer commented:

If she's the sort of wife who has to ask her husband [...] about everything, you
will never succeed.[8]

The absences of seafarers inevitably have an impact on their partners and
families. Women speak of missing the companionship of their partner as well
as the physical intimacy, affection and practical support in household and
family matters.[9] Research carried out on the partners of seafarers in India and
the Philippines found that many suffer from considerable levels of anxiety
associated with the absence of the seafaring partner. These worries were
###### predominantly related to the seafarers' health and safety, but women
additionally reported being concerned about their partner's sexual fidelity.[1][0]

Research carried out in Australia on seafarers' wives found that nearly half (42
###### per cent) the women felt that their relationship with their partner was greatly
at risk because of the seafaring lifestyle, with 25 per cent believing that their
###### partner was having or had had an affair.[1][1]

Periods of separation can be particularly demanding for couples with
###### young children: seafarers miss their children, and their partners have to cope with the demands of parenthood and all its associated decisions on their own.[1][2]

Some seafarers' wives seem to find that their social lives are more restricted
when their husbands are absent, feeling that many events are inappropriate
###### without their partner;[13] additionally, some are concerned that they might attract
unwanted sexual attention were they to attend events unaccompanied.[1][4]

However, life on returning home isn't automatically rosy. Prolonged
separations can have a dramatic impact on the lives of families, with children
scarcely knowing their absent parent and partners feeling that their lives are
more "normal" when their "other half" is at sea.[1][5] Some partners become so
adept at managing the home and family alone that, on their return home,
seafarers can become disillusioned on the realization that their family has
###### functioned successfully in their absence. As one seafarer commented:
"I always felt, not as if I wasn't important, but that they could survive
###### without me."[16]

The global seafarer

###### The problems mentioned above are similar to those found in research
carried out on military personnel. A study that included British Royal Navy
wives found that, as the women became more experienced at coping alone,
tensions moved from coping with the absence of the partner to reintegrating
###### them into the household on their return home.[17] More practised naval wives
were said to feign helplessness when their husbands were home in order to
minimize the tension caused by husbands' feelings of emasculation as a result
of their partners' evident competence.[18] Similarly, earlier research into the
family lives of trawler men also reflected this dilemma: husbands were reported
###### to want their wives to be independent and good managers, but if they became too self-reliant, the men felt that they were loved only for their pay packets.[1][9]
 There are other factors that can lead to problems during seafarers'
periods of leave. Their intermittent presence at home can make it difficult for
###### them to develop and maintain shore-based friendships, which can result in
loneliness or high levels of dependency on partners and immediate family for
social contact. Even where friendships are maintained, the work patterns and
###### commitments of people in shore-based employment often mean that seafarers
still spend a significant amount of their free time alone. Indeed, some seafarers
can find themselves looking forward to returning to sea because of long and
###### unstructured periods of leave.[20]

Problems associated with seafaring work patterns can peak during the
###### transitional periods from ship to shore and from home back to sea.[21] On their return home, seafarers have to make the difficult adjustment between the
dramatically different worlds of work and home, while their partners have to
get used to having another adult in the household again.[22] Tensions develop
when seafarers first return home and unwind and adjust to family life again.[23]

Increased workloads because of reduced crewing levels and less job security
have led to a rise in the levels of stress and fatigue,[24] which have an impact on
###### both work and family life.[25] Seafarers may return home physically exhausted,
emotionally tense and unable to relax and "switch off" immediately from their
###### shipboard responsibilities.[26] Conflict can also occur as seafarers attempt to
assume the position of "head of the household".[27] The period before a
seafarer's return to sea can also be fraught with tension as couples anticipate
the departure and seafarers become anxious about completing practical tasks
and meeting social obligations before returning to sea.[28]

###### Health and safety

Research suggests that seafaring work patterns and the associated intermittent
absences of seafarers from their families can have detrimental consequences on
###### both health and safety. A study of Australian seafarers found that the

148


-----

Seafarers' families

###### "home/work interface" was reported to be the greatest source of stress for
them, regardless of rank,[29] findings that have been reiterated by studies of
workers in the offshore industries.[30] These findings reflect earlier research
with Polish trawler crews and seafarers, where again, periods of separation
from family and friends were found to be the most frequently cited stress
###### factor associated with their work (ranked highest by 84 per cent of fishermen
and 59 per cent of seafarers, respectively).[31] Research work carried out on
###### harbour physicians in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, identified three main
psychological problems among seafarers: loneliness, homesickness and "burn-
###### out" syndrome. These problems were primarily caused by long periods away
from home, the decline in the number of seafarers per ship and increased
automation.[32] The stress associated with frequent absences from home can
become particularly acute when there is a family crisis. Such anxieties can be
especially difficult for seafarers to deal with while at sea, since many seafarers
find it difficult to speak about emotional domestic problems and seafarers
cannot draw on shore-based social networks, which they might normally turn
###### to for support.[33] Living with family problems while at sea can have severe
consequences: investigations into suicide at sea have identified the role of
marital and family problems as a contributory factor.[34]

###### In addition to affecting a seafarer's health, anxieties about family
members and loneliness caused by prolonged separations and the lack of
###### opportunity for any contact can have an impact on work performance, which
may have significant repercussions on safety in the workplace. Research
carried out on airline pilots has suggested that domestic stress and other major
life events can have a detrimental effect on a pilot's judgement and well-
being.[35] The importance of the spouse as a social support system, enabling the
###### pilot to cope with stress, has been acknowledged by the aviation industry,
along with the specific problems associated with a marriage where one partner
is frequently absent.[36] Indeed, even where there are no perceived problems in
family relations, the emotional deprivation associated with prolonged absences
###### from partners and loved ones can lead to psychological deterioration and
increased rates of emotional tension, which, in turn, may lead to a rise in stress
levels, emotional alertness and aggression, all of which threaten individual and
workplace health and safety.[37] Behavioural changes as a result of family and
relationship problems have frequently been reported in research on British
seafarers.[38] As one senior officer recalled:

Another guy actually comes to mind       - he's another engineer. He was just really
obnoxious and nasty to everyone for quite a while and then we sort of found
out        - he got violent one night with the second mate after a night of drinking in
a port          - that his missus was sort of carrying on behind his back, you know. And

149


-----

The global seafarer

he didn't talk about it at all until, "That bitch, I've divorced her", that sort of
thing. So yeah, but I mean that was the way that guy reacted, you know. He
didn't tell anyone at all            - he was just, like, sort of miserable and sort of
horrible.[39]

Finally, although seafarers' partners do not have the pressures of
physically having to leave their homes and families, there is some evidence to
suggest that their partners' intermittent absences can have a detrimental effect
on their own health: the rates of depression and anxiety among seafarers'
###### partners are higher than in the general population.[40] An Australian study of
seafarers' wives found that 83 per cent of the respondents reported some
degree of stress when their partners were due home or about to return to sea,
###### with nearly one in ten (8 per cent) reporting that they took medication to help them cope.[41]

 Social isolation aboard and ashore

The relationships between couples and families have become increasingly
###### important in meeting the emotional and social needs of individuals,[42] and are
arguably of particular importance to seafarers working in the industry today.
###### Historically, seafarers were known to have a workplace culture that promoted strong, solidary friendships.[43] However, reduced crewing levels,
fast turnaround times, increased automation and longer working hours mean
###### that seafarers are forming fewer on-board friendships, which is leading to concerns that many are leading increasingly isolated lives.[44] Modern crewing patterns, including small crews (reflected in single-person tasking), employment by contract, unsynchronized leave periods and geographical separation can mean that close friendships are difficult to instigate and
maintain. Research carried out on British seafarers suggests that friendships
on board are typically restricted to working relationships of the nature of
###### "on-board acquaintances" as opposed to close, confiding relationships. As
one junior officer explained:

You know them, but you don't really know them. [...] You have nothing to do
with them outside work          - basically it's like any job. Unless there are a couple who
are really on the same wavelength as you.[45]

Officers can find developing good friendships particularly problematic,
since they may feel that they need to keep their distance from junior
colleagues in order to maintain respect and authority. Women seafarers on
cargo vessels also find themselves socially isolated owing to the huge gender
imbalance on board.[46]

Seafarers' families

###### Not only can seafarers find it difficult to form close, long-term
friendships while at sea, many find that maintaining shore-based friendships is
far from easy; long absences and the cost of ship-shore communication do not
facilitate close friendships. Seafarers, therefore, tend to rely to a very large
extent on their partners and immediate family as a means of social support and
as a link to wider social networks.[47] As Fricke has noted: "The wife provides
the vicarious link with society ashore for the married officer through the
###### provision of home and a network of friends."[48] In this context, the
consequences of a relationship breakdown can be particularly severe.

###### Ship-shore communication

 Opportunities to communicate ship-shore can potentially have a considerable
impact on the experience of separation for both seafarers and their partners.
Regular contact can be crucial in maintaining good relationships with the
family and shore-based life;[49] too little contact can lead to the decline and
eventual breakdown of relationships.[50] Contact with home is important for a
###### number of reasons: to allay fears; to maintain close relationships; to improve
seafarers' morale; as a way of relieving stress (on board and at home); and to
maintain good relationships with children. For unmarried couples whose
marriages are being arranged, ship-shore communication can be vital, not just
###### to sustain the relationship but for the couple to get to know each other in the
first place. An Indian wife of a seafarer commented:

He kept on ringing me up from every port, every port. There's no money but it
didn't matter. He just kept talking. I said, "It's becoming expensive." But he said,
"No, no. You keep on talking to me." Then he called his mother and his father.
He kept on talking to them. After all that, I got to know him. Because initially,
we didn't know each other at all.[51]

The importance of being able to get in touch with family can increase at
various points within a voyage and at certain times in a seafarer's career. For
example, making contact can become particularly important when family
members are ill, a situation that can lead to a dramatic rise in stress levels for
the seafarer.[52] Furthermore, many seafarers are now working in conditions
###### that make it difficult to instigate and maintain shipboard relationships, and
consequently rely more and more on networks at home for social support.

The range of communication facilities available to seafarers includes faxes
and satellite telephone calls. However, research suggests that traditional letter
###### writing continues to be an important means of keeping in touch. Letters are
valued for their tangible nature and for the fact they can be "revisited", that is,
re-read. Indeed, in the routine, monotony and isolation of shipboard life, the

151


-----

The global seafarer

arrival of mail aboard ship can take on a considerable degree of significance,[53]

as a junior officer explained:

It's a very big, very big part of keeping the morale up in the ship              - the mail thing.

[...] It's another means of communicating with home and you're thinking, "Well,
are they, the office, committed in sending it?" I don't know if they realize how
important it is. But you do see a new change sort of thing, if mail comes or if mail
doesn't come.[54]

Advances in communication technology have undoubtedly increased
###### opportunities for seafarers and their families to make contact on a more regular basis. Indeed, such developments have been found to be of
considerable significance in the lives of work-separated couples.[55] Email and
access to cheaper international telephone calls (on coastal routes) via mobile
###### phones have been particularly welcomed by seafarers and their families, and
valued, among other things, for the immediacy of contact and relatively low
cost.[56] It has been found that communicating by email and mobile phone
allows seafarers to keep up with the small everyday events that might not
necessarily be reported in a letter or mentioned on their return home.
Retaining a sense of "participating" in home life can considerably reduce the
stress of intermittent absences on both seafarers and their partners and can be
vital for seafarers when dealing with the transition between ship and home. In
a study of seafaring and family life, two British senior officers commented:

[I'm] constantly in touch with her by email, so it's like I'm away but I'm not away.

And, it [email] does help that period when you come home, because you do know
what's going on.[57]

###### Despite the potential to improve communication opportunities for
seafarers, the shipping industry has, in general, been slow to utilize computers
and telecommunication facilities, particularly on board vessels.[58] Indeed,
research into the communication patterns of seafarers has shown that
INMARSAT communication services, which are often extremely expensive,
are widely used in ship-shore communications.[59] For those seafarers on both
coastal and deep-sea routes, email is an inexpensive and easy way to keep in
touch. However, email access continues to be limited       - it is often restricted to
officers        - and is impeded by the fact that many seafarers may not be computer-
###### literate and that family and friends ashore may also lack access.[60]

Developments in telephone technology mean that seafarers can phone home
using mobile phones in national and international waters as long as the ship is
in port or within close range of land. However, for those on deep-sea routes,
this service is limited and access is also restricted because of cost. Modern

152

Seafarers families

technology can be expensive: in addition to everyday running expenses, the
initial purchase of equipment can involve a large financial outlay. However,
research seems to suggest that seafaring families have higher rates of
ownership of personal computers and mobile phones than the general
population.[61]

###### Company policies and their impact on family life

The effect of seafaring work patterns on family life is not uniform: conditions
of service can dramatically influence the experience for both seafarers and their
families. The length of tour of duty and the ratio of shore to sea-time can vary
considerably between seafarers. For those seafarers employed by voyage, leave
time can be marred by the fact that no money is coming in as well as concerns
about getting another contract.[62] Access to cheaper communication facilities,
###### shorter tours of duty and opportunities for families to sail together can all help
seafarers and their families maintain good relationships and reduce the
###### disruption of a seafaring career on family life.

As the shipping industry has become increasingly regulated, so the
demands made on seafarers to ensure that they meet industry training
standards (such as STCW-95) have grown. Since they are unable to attend
courses while at sea, seafarers often have no choice but to complete
prerequisite courses during their periods of leave. Such training courses can be
substantial in duration (some can last up to three months)[6][3] and in financial
cost to the seafarer. In the context of a leave period of perhaps eight weeks,
even relatively short courses can present a significant encroachment on leave
time and on the time available with partners and families, as a second
engineer's wife in China bemoaned:

It is an ocean-going vessel and the voyage lasts for a minimum of 11 months;
normally it lasts for more than a year. Last year he was on the ship for more than
13 months (he only came back this April) and a month and a bit later he was called
back by the company to do a 48-day training scheme. The scheme was in
Guangzhou. During the four months when he was back, he was home for less than
half that time. Then he did the training course. After that he was home for less
than a week, then he was called to go back aboard the ship.[64]

Tightening global regulation also has implications for seafarers unable to
###### obtain appropriate certification. Such seafarers may find that their
employment opportunities are severely restricted and, when they do get work,
###### they may be limited to sailing on sub-standard ships for low wages and under
generally poor employment conditions. These seafarers and their families can
find themselves in a spiral of debt, as seafarers may have to borrow money to

153


-----

The global seafarer

secure employment on vessels, only to be paid wages that are insufficient to
meet the costs of repaying loans and supporting their families.[65] To counteract
the detrimental effect on family life of requisite training courses and
certification, companies could contribute to the cost of necessary courses and
compensate for any loss of leave time because of training.

Companies could support seafarers and their families by occasionally
allowing their partners and, where possible, their children, to sail with them.
###### Opportunities for couples to sail together vary within companies and
according to rank. Many companies restrict this invitation to officers or senior
officers only. Rarely are the partners of ratings offered the chance to sail and,
even if they were given the opportunity, the costs of travelling to join the
vessel would probably be prohibitive. However, the benefits can undoubtedly
be great: women who have sailed with their partners have said that they
enjoyed being able to spend more time with their partners and that it helped
###### them to obtain a better understanding of their partner's work and life at sea.[66]

The children of seafarers could also profit from visiting ships or sailing as
these opportunities would break up long periods of separation and allow
family bonds to be maintained. This could be particularly important in the case
of younger children, who can change considerably over the period of a tour of
###### duty and consequently have difficulty recognizing and remembering their
seafaring parent. As one adult child of a seafarer explained:

Oh [sailing with him] definitely did help. [Seeing] what his cabin was like, the size
of the cabin, you know, how many other people he lived with, where he ate, his
routine, his isolation and the loneliness that he probably felt as well at times.[67]

###### In some countries, such as China, where women have traditionally not
been allowed to sail with their husbands, it is more usual for the wives of
seafarers to visit their husbands on board when the ship is in port. Women
have been reported making long and arduous journeys in order to spend some
time with their husbands.[68] In the past, when turnaround times were longer,
women could spend several days with their partner while the ship was
operating in port. By contrast, it is now much less common for women to
spend several days travelling to meet their husbands to spend only hours,
###### rather than days, together. The wife of a Chinese second officer explained:

He was at sea when our child was born. Our child is 8 months old now. Three
months ago, when his ship was calling at Qingdao, I took the child and my parents
to visit him there. He was missing us so much that he said that he would be happy
if he could only have a look at the baby. Otherwise, he would have to wait for
another few months when our child would be 1 year old. So I agreed. I had a painful
arm; I had to take my parents to help me on the way. It was a long journey, from

Nanyang to Qingdao       - 29 hours by train. By the time we arrived there, it was
already 5 o'clock in the afternoon and the ship was due to sail at 10. We met for
only four hours. I was really sad. [...] I wish he could have stayed longer. But the
ship had been loaded and unloaded so quickly that I had to take my baby and leave
the ship after being with him for only four hours![69]

Giving partners the opportunity to sail has obvious benefits for couples'
relationships, reducing the length of time between separations, and providing
###### partners with a greater understanding of life and work at sea. Having a partner
who has sailed may be particularly advantageous to seafarers, who often rely
heavily on their partners for emotional support and for advice on problems
and events that occur on board.[70] Partners who have sailed become familiar
###### with shipboard life and working conditions and may, therefore, be able to offer
more encouragement to their seafaring partners in their careers.[71]

The accessibility of two-way contact between companies and families can
vary greatly. Research carried out on seafarers' families has shown that getting
in touch easily in times of emergencies or crises is extremely important.[72] A
###### number of companies have policies of repatriation for their crew in the event of the death or serious illness of a close family member. However, this is not
extended to all seafarers and, within companies, can depend on rank. Even
where free repatriation is available, seafarers who are employed on single-
voyage contracts may be reluctant to be repatriated owing to uncertainties
###### about their next job opportunity. Such worries may be exacerbated if seafarers
find themselves responsible for medical costs associated with the death or
illness of the family member. Similarly, some seafarers who have been
###### repatriated return to their ship prematurely because they are worried that
extended leave periods will be viewed negatively or unsympathetically by their
employers. Without their usual (shore-based) social support networks,
seafarers who remain at sea or return to sea after an insufficient period at home
can experience a rise in stress levels.

Being able to make contact is particularly important when accidents or
emergencies occur at sea. Inefficient communication between companies and
families can aggravate an already distressing situation. Some companies take
steps to inform families of the relevant details of incidents, including, as far
as possible, an explanation as to how and why certain events occurred.
However, it is not unusual for families to find out about shipboard incidents
and emergencies through less direct means, such as television news broadcasts
###### or newspaper reports,[73] which can be extremely upsetting.[74] In some cases,
seafarers may also be the sole earner for large extended families, and the
emotional grief at their injury or death may be compounded by concerns
###### about how the family is to survive financially. Evidence suggests that the P&I Clubs' methods of handling injuries and death claims for seafarers and their

families are questionable.[75] While not easing the emotional distress of loss of
life or severe injury, adequate compensation for the families of seafarers
involved in an accident can certainly help to alleviate the distress caused by
economic anxieties.

The unique situation of seafaring families can make support from and
###### contact with other seafaring families important. However, opportunities to do
this vary greatly by country. The Seafarers' Wives Associations, organized by
the Apostleship of the Sea, assists Filipino seafarers and their families, while
the wives of Chinese seafarers have the support of the Seafarers' Wives
###### Committee, an organization introduced by the trade unions of shipping
companies under the supervision of each company's Party Committee,[76] with
the aim of "uniting seafarers' wives at the home-front and providing support
for seafarers at sea".[77] Seafarers' wives and families in other countries may not
be so fortunate: sometimes small in number and geographically dispersed,
many are offered little in the way of outside support and rely instead on the
networks of family and friends.[78] While at sea, seafarers have to turn to visiting
chaplains or utilize (increasingly limited) periods in port to visit seafarers'
welfare centres such as Missions to Seafarers.

 SUB-STANDARD

 SHIPS AND

 ABANDONED

 SEAFARERS

Seafarers ofthe Turkish-owned OBO Basak,
abandoned in Dunkirk, France, in 1997

###### Introduction

 Abandoned crews and sub-standard ships tend to travel together. As one
speaker at the 1999 International Union of Marine Insurance Conference
remarked, "Owners who cannot afford (or do not wish) to spend money
maintaining their ships tend not to spend money on their crews either".[1] It is,
###### on the other hand, not necessarily true that owners of sub-standard ships will,
at some time or other, abandon their crews, and neither is it true that
###### abandoned crews are always engaged aboard sub-standard ships. Large
numbers of crews were abandoned in the course of the Adriatic Tankers
collapse in 1995-96, but many of the ships were structurally in reasonable
condition.[2] In the case of the abandoned crew of the OBO Basak, dealt with
in some detail in this chapter, the physical condition of the ship was not an
issue. These considerations suggest that a definition of sub-standard based on
###### both social and physical structural criteria would be useful, and the aim of the
following discussion is to establish a case for doing so. Accordingly, this
###### chapter begins by evaluating the terms and issues conventionally raised in
shipping industry debates on sub-standard ships and then addresses questions
###### of definition and regulatory responsibility. The second and larger part of the chapter assesses seafarers' exposure to abandonment, using case studies to
illustrate typical instances, and examines the social and economic costs
###### incurred by abandoned crews. A section on ILO and IMO Conventions and other international treaties on abandonment concludes the chapter.

###### Defining and identifying the sub-standard ship

The debate in maritime circles about sub-standard ships is as old as the
modern industry      - "coffin-ships" was the term widely used in the nineteenth
###### century - but not until very recent decades has the question reappeared as a continuing preoccupation. Of course, sub-standard ships had never been
entirely eradicated, but it has only been since the 1980s that they have once
again been seen as threatening good practice. A press report of a speech made
by the head of the Paris MOU in 1993 illustrates the level of concern often
expressed by leading figures in the industry (box 7.1).

Estimates of the number of sub-standard ships generally amount to little
###### better than guesswork. The figure of 10 per cent of ships, which seems to be
based on PSC detention rates, is quite widely used in Europe. Lord
###### Donaldson, a prominent legal figure in the United Kingdom who chaired an
inquiry to consider the prevention of pollution from merchant shipping in the
wake of the 1993 Braer tanker disaster off the Shetland Islands,[3] was quoted as
saying that there was "clear evidence" that 9 to 10 per cent of all ships visiting
###### north-west European ports were sub-standard.[4] In the absence of other
publicly available data, this figure is the most defensible, even though it must
certainly be an underestimate. The reach of European PSC is stretched in all
member countries and it is generally acknowledged that there are not enough

Box 7.1 Bid to cut disgrace of sub-standard ships

By Jim Mulrenan

A call for increased cooperation between all parties with a genuine interest in maritime
safety "to make the world too small for sub-standard ships" was made by Captain
Henk Huibers, the head of the Paris MOU secretariat. It was imperative not only from
a safety and environmental standpoint but also for commercial reasons that action
against sub-standard shipping should continue. The shipping industry had a right not
to be harassed by unfair competition and it was necessary to get back to a situation
in which shipowners could afford to have well-trained crews on well-maintained ships,
Capt. Huibers told the conference. PSG was, however, not the remedy against at! evils
and could never be a substitute for adequate standards and effective enforcement by
flag states. "All parties with a genuine concern in the safety of shipping and the
welfare of seamen, no matter whether they are flag states, shipowners, underwriters,
trade unions, maritime lawyers, charterers or port states, should co-operate, with the
ultimate aim to stop the operation of sub-standard ships," he said. "Sub-standard
shipping is a sheer disgrace to the whole maritime industry and has done the industry
more than enough harm, not only in terms of dollars and cents but also in terms of
reputation."

inspectors to ensure sufficient coverage, especially of the smaller ports. PSC
in some other world regions is either non-existent or patchy in application,
and it is often poorly resourced. If the 10 per cent level is accurate for the
relatively well-regulated ports of northern Europe, then the level in many parts
of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle and Far East must be substantially
higher. Although it must be the case that the incidence of sub-standard
shipping varies considerably with region, it should also be recognized that it
can often vary between sectors. Market and ship-ownership structures in some
sectors, such as mainline container ships and chemical and gas tankers, are
extremely well regulated. As outlined in Chapter 1, ownership in these two
sectors is highly concentrated and the buyers of shipping services require high
standards of reliability. However, in the bulker and general cargo sectors,
ownership is fragmented and reliability requirements are often far less
onerous; unsurprisingly, it is in these sectors that rates of ship detention and
###### abandonment are relatively high.
 In the past, as today, sub-standard ships have generally been defined in
terms of the decayed nature of their structure and equipment. A look at the
Australian inquiry into the loss, with all hands, of the 94,000 ton, Panamanian-
flagged bulker, the Alexandre-P, provides a good example of what has come to
be regarded as sub-standard. In giving evidence, "the ship's provider said that
this was the worst rust-bucket he had boarded in his 15 years of boarding
vessels. Shift supervisors concerned with the loading operations said that there
were holes in transverse bulkheads and fist-sized holes in hatch coamings. [...]
###### The hull of the heavily corroded ship in her departure condition had been
considerably sagged."[5]

###### Although PSC officers typically focus on comparable issues and, for
example, vivid descriptions of badly rusted deck furniture, rotten lifeboats and
fire hoses often appear in reports, social standards issues also occasionally
feature. In 1994, for example, a Dutch PSC described what he had found on
inspecting a ship at the request of police officers:

The crew had gone on shore to have dinner, but could not pay their bill. The police
accompanied the men on board to find the ship had no generators, the crew had
had no pay for six months and did not even have a supply of drinking water. The
ship was detained. After some weeks, we got a call from a man who said he was
the owner. He wanted to talk. He came to visit and described himself as a banker
who had some friends who had advised him that he could make money on ships.
We asked him if he knew he had to pay money out as well. The owner stayed in
port and called me from time to time claiming that everything on board was all
right. Eventually the ship got a single voyage certificate to carry out repairs. Finally,
I got a call from the social welfare people in Rotterdam to report that the crew was
actually drinking water from the port.[6]

The global seafarer

The public pronouncements made by leading figures in shipping on the
subject are generally concerned with the consequences for the industry of
###### harbouring a sub-standard sector and with whom should be held responsible
for maintaining good order. Speaking at a conference in the United States in
1994, Gregory Hadjeilleftheriadis, a spokesperson for the Greek company
Eletson, argued:

There is sometimes an assumption that an owner who operated quality tonnage
with the best crews would automatically gain a reward for his zeal. In a just world
this would be the case. But in reality the quality owner was often up against the
sub-standard or marginal operator, who was more than capable of making profits
from his lower overhead, which eluded his quality competitor.[7]

This complaint by professional owners of being undercut had been so
widely and recurrently heard that, in 1996, the OECD produced an
assessment of the competitive advantages accruing to owners of sub-standard
ships, followed up by an additional report in 2001 seeking to identify and
measure the costs incurred by users of sub-standard ships.[8]

The first OECD report estimated that "a significant percentage of total
vessel operating costs could be saved by sub-standard operations". In the
second, the OECD made the following comment: "There is a strong incentive
###### for charterers and cargo owners to see the continued existence of low-quality
ships, as these help to facilitate inexpensive carriage of their cargoes.
Conversely, any move towards eliminating such vessels implies an inevitable
rise in freight expenses." This last comment echoes frequently heard calls for
cargo owners to be held as accountable as other parties. Lars Lindfelt,
managing director of the Swedish P&I Club, argued in 1996 that "ways should
be found to make it more difficult for cargo owners to recover losses from
shipowners when a sub-standard ship was involved".[9]

Two years later, Spyros Polemis of Seacrest Shipping urged charterers to
make certain that the vessels they employed were not sub-standard and
insisted that charterers should accept the additional costs of employing good
ships.[1][0] Such comments are a reflection of the frustration experienced by
###### industry professionals, and cargo owners/charterers are not the only targets.
Classification societies have been held at fault for inadequate rigour in
###### structural surveys, underwriters for insuring poor ships, flag States for
deficient regulation and shipowners for uncaring negligence. In this search to
find someone to take responsibility for a state of affairs in which owners of
###### sub-standard ships can exploit their crews and subvert professional standards,
it could seem, as the Norwegian brokerage house Fearnley's has put it, that
"owners, charterers, insurers, port authorities, governments and classification
societies have been passing the buck like a hot potato".[11] The problem,

162

###### though, is not so much that the various parties are failing to accept their proper responsibilities but that the shipping industry's historical regulatory structure - once integrated by the entire ensemble of a flag State's relevant
organizations and institutions (see Chapter 2)     - has been fragmented as a
result of flagging out to sovereignties incapable of duplicating the web of
###### negotiated consent of the older maritime states, which had learned how to control the marginal shipowner.
 It seems that the main problem lies in the fact that the interdependent subsets of the industry - the classification societies, shipowners, flag States, trade unions, charterers, insurers and so on - have yet to find an effective
means of imposing good professional standards in the commercial, technical
and social aspects of ship operation on a global scale. In the absence of such
a means, more reliance is being placed on PSC agencies to enforce IMO and
###### ILO Conventions and Codes as a way of raising minimum standards
(box 7.2). This dependence on PSC as a regulator acknowledges the fact
###### that the most effective way of correcting dysfunctions in the markets for shipping services is through the administrative capacities of the embedded maritime nations.[1][2]

Two concerns have dominated the modern debate on sub-standard ships:
###### the competitive disadvantages incurred by owners and administrations who

Box 7.2 Europe urged to back port controls

By Marion Welham

A leading insurer has called on European governments to back PSC in a bid to close
the loopholes on sub-standard ships. Roger Nixon, Chairman of the Joint Hull
Committee at the Institute of London Underwriters, told Lloyd's List that Europe must
tighten up to match the more effective Norwegian, Australian and Canadian regimes.
Hard on the heels of the PSC committee meeting in Bonn, which agreed to target nine
flag states, Mr. Nixon said: "Flag states are just a laugh. You tighten up one flag state
and another one starts. It is just ludicrous. You will never get a lasso on all these
different flag states."

Mr. Nixon said that PSC should be boosted to cover inspection of the steel work as
well as getting to grips with whether crews were properly trained. More resources
would be needed. "Most of the flag states are not serious players. They are just in it
for the money," said Mr. Nixon. "But port states have a serious interest in the quality
of the ship coming in. [...] PSC is the best answer because ports have no axes to
grind. [...] If the port authority does not like his ship, they should have no problem
about making it pretty damn public."

operate their ships according to good professional standards and the matter of
determining responsibility for the continued existence of sub-standard ships.
As regards the former concern, there is no reason to doubt that operators of
###### sub-standard ships have lower costs. The calculations produced by the OECD
illustrate the cost savings to be made by operating ships below the standards
required by IMO Conventions; the report suggests, for example, that an
annual saving of $37,000 could be made simply by undermanning a 20-year-old
###### bulker of 30,000 dwt by two people. Additional savings could be made by regulatory avoidance in respect of the SOLAS Convention requirements and
the ILO Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1976 (No.
147).[1][3] Surprisingly, the question of allocating responsibility for the continued
existence of sub-standard ships has not been the subject of any inquiry or
research involving closely reasoned argument. At various times and in addition
###### to owners and flag States, insurers, charterers and classification societies
have all been held to be at fault, but there can be little doubt that responsibility
###### for the condition of a ship and its crew rests with its owner, while the State represented in the ship's flag and registry is responsible for ensuring the owner's compliance with international Conventions and for properly
exercising a duty of care so that others are not victims of the owner's
negligence.[1][4]

The debate on sub-standard ships has also suffered from a lack of
definitional precision and economic analysis of sub-standard shipowners. It
was only with the publication of the OECD's 2001 report that a clear
specification of criteria became available. The report states that a ship is sub-
standard when it:

          - is technically unsound;

          - fails to comply with mandatory international Conventions;

          - is irregularly maintained;

          - has insufficiently trained and qualified crew;

          - has poor employment conditions for crew;

          - has poor shore-based management.

The OECD did not attempt to specify whether all or just some of these
criteria are sufficient to determine whether a ship is sub-standard.

As far as the economics of ownership are concerned, the OECD report
states that when freight earnings are low "irresponsible owners tend to cut
back on vessel maintenance [and] when markets subsequently rise, these
owners are too concerned about keeping their ships trading, rather than

164

Sub-standard ships and abandoned seafarers

###### undertaking any backlog of repairs".[1][5] These observations are almost certainly
accurate but they refer to specific patterns of behaviour rather than to the
general commercial calculations made by owners of sub-standard ships. A
brief discussion of these considerations suggests that, rather than there being
a group of owners who consistently operate poor ships, it may be more useful
###### to think in terms of a category of marginal owners who are more or less likely to operate sub-standard ships according to trading conditions.
 Whatever the phase of the business cycle, commercial advantages are
likely to accrue to those owners operating their ships with poor technical and
social standards, since in any given market owners with the lowest costs will
enjoy the highest margins. However, it does not follow that such owners
invariably operate sub-standard ships. When markets are buoyant, the
marginal operator will be anxious to avoid detention or arrest and will,
###### therefore, pay more attention to the condition of ships and crews, satisfying creditors to ensure that the ship can continue to earn high margins.
Conversely, when markets subside, the marginal operator will cut costs and
###### hope to escape pursuing creditors and the PSC net. If, however, these
marginal owners are fleet owners and operate some ships sufficiently above
###### the margin to escape detention or arrest, they will not easily be squeezed out of the market. And even if they are, it is likely that they will have enough expertise and access to capital to return to marginal operation when freight markets turn upwards again. If this analysis is correct, it would seem that the only way to exclude them permanently from trading would be to put in
place a global licensing system for shipowners, similar to the one that exists
in civil aviation.

###### Abandoned seafarers

Large numbers of seafarers are being abandoned on a recurrent basis. The
###### problem is a global one in that it is not confined to any particular world region
and it illustrates the conditions typical for those seafarers employed aboard
###### sub-standard ships. Not all owners of sub-standard ships abandon their crews, although operating ships of this sort does involve resorting to commercial and
operational practices that are at the margins of economic viability The
###### possibility of crews being abandoned aboard sub-standard ships, on which all
costs are shaved, particularly those related to regulatory compliance, is high. If
###### the conventional assumption that 10 per cent of ships are sub-standard is
accepted and that, on average, these ships have crews of 15 people, then at any
one moment some 60,000 seafarers are at risk of being abandoned.

Usually, seafarers find themselves abandoned when their ships have been
placed under legal arrest by creditors or when the owners are unable to meet

the costs of crew wages, bunkers or repairs resulting from collisions, weather
damage, class survey requirements or detention by PSC inspectors. In these
cases, abandonment almost invariably applies to entire crews. There are also
cases in which ships set sail, leaving behind crew members who are owed wages
and with no provisions for repatriation. These seafarers have either been
physically ejected from the ship (often for complaining about conditions) or
discharged owing to injury, illness or dismissal. Abandonment, then, can be
defined as a refusal on the part of the owner to acknowledge obligations to
crew members as required by either customary duty of care, contracts of
employment (both implicit and actual) or by international Conventions and
flag State maritime legal codes.

The duration of abandonment and the time it takes to reach a resolution can
vary from several weeks to as long as several years; indeed, some cases are never
resolved. Living and working conditions commonly deteriorate rapidly after
abandonment, although the impact varies according to the country in which
abandonment occurs, the physical condition of the ship, the remaining supplies
of food and fuel and the extent to which the crew receive support from statutory
and voluntary organizations through local and national media exposure.

Since the mid-1990s, the shipping industry has witnessed a number of
major company collapses that have led to ships and their crews being
abandoned. In the past seven years, Adriatic Tankers (1995-96), UNIMAR
(1996), Regency Cruises (1995-97), Baltic Shipping (1995-96), Blasco
(1996-97), Dragonix (1997), Navrom, Romline and Petromin (1997-98) and
Renaissance (2001) have all collapsed, all of which were well-publicized cases.
However, abandonment is not a new phenomenon, although, owing to the
lack of systematic study of a suitable period of years, the extent of the problem
is difficult to establish. Existing evidence in a collected if raw form can be
###### found in the records of the ITF's Actions Department, the New York-based Center for Seafarers' Rights and the justice and welfare section of the Mission to Seafarers. Other evidence is scattered around the world in the files of local
newspapers, shipping agents, trade unions and seafarers[5] missions. The
accessible records at the ITF and the two mission organizations are, therefore,
inevitably incomplete. These organizations only have offices and centres in the
larger of the world's ports and although these ports may be networked with
satellite regional ports, there are significant areas of the world         - in Africa and
###### south and south-east Asia - where the three reporting organizations have, at
best, a thinly stretched presence. It should also be noted that even in those
world regions where the ITF and the International Christian Maritime
Association (ICMA)-affiliated organizations have an established presence, the
density of their intelligence coverage of ships is not uniformly high. None of
these organizations, even in their "heartlands", has sufficient resources to

generate adequate knowledge of problem ships. Each of them depends to a
very large degree on information passed on by shore workers and officers of
agencies routinely coming into contact with ships' crews. Owners' agents,
cargo surveyors, port officials, port health officers, dock and river police,
customs officers, dockers, ship repair workers, tugmen, lorry, bus and taxi
drivers are all receivers and potential transmitters of relevant information
###### about crews.

Taken together, those who have contact with ships and crews are the first
link in the chain of the informal information exchange network holding pieces
of knowledge about shipboard conditions in any given port. Where they are
willing, these network members, without being in any way imperatively
organized, can directly or indirectly by word-of-mouth bring problems to the
###### attention of organizations concerned with seafarers' welfare. However,
informal systems are at best haphazardly efficient and it is clear that
abandoned seafarers are only unfailingly logged and attended to in highly
organized States, so that, while it is hard to imagine that abandoned seafarers
###### would pass unnoticed in Rotterdam or Singapore, Australia or Japan, one
might be less confident if the regions were Central America or Eastern
Europe. In short, the available data about to be examined, understate the
###### extent of abandonment.

In 1999, the ITF and the two ICMA affiliates between them were
involved, to a greater or lesser degree, in 97 cases of abandonment. The ITF
was notified of 55 cases, but since it was only directly involved in 40 of them,
the data presented below in table 7.1 include only those 40 cases. The same
###### criterion for inclusion of data (direct involvement) has been applied to the other two reporting organizations - the Center for Seafarers' Rights and the
Mission to Seafarers.

As table 7.1 shows, the data are not uniformly complete; there are 19
cases in which the numbers of people are not recorded and 16 cases in which
###### their nationalities are unrecorded. The data also fail to specify the extent to
which whole crews were abandoned, although it would seem reasonable to
assume that all crew members were involved in each case except for five ships
where the numbers were small. On average, some 18 seafarers per ship were
###### abandoned and, assuming this average applies to those ships short of data, this leaves a total of 2,149 people of 38 different nationalities. With only a
very few exceptions, the seafarers were abandoned away from their home
###### countries. Fifty-one of the ships had single nationality and 30 had mixed nationality crews. Nineteen ships had Ukrainian crews, 17 ships Russian, 12
ships Indian, 12 ships Romanian, ten ships Greek, nine ships Filipino, six
ships Indonesian and six ships Pakistani nationals aboard, either in mixed or
single nationality crews.

Sources: See table 7.1.

The average age of the abandoned ships was 23. The newest ship was 5 years
old and the oldest was built in 1958. Table 7.2 categorizes the abandoned ships
according to their types and shows that, in 1999, general cargo ships, together
with bulk carriers, accounted for almost 60 per cent of abandoned ships, although
###### they made up only 44 per cent of the world fleet. The over-representation of
general cargo ships and bulkers is consistent with the general view that sub-
standard ships are concentrated in these sectors.

Table 7.3 shows abandoned ships according to their flag State. Although
the ships are registered in 24 different flag States, they are clustered in a smaller
###### number of states. Almost 70 per cent of abandoned ships were attached to just
six flags: Panama (16 per cent), Malta (15 per cent), the Russian Federation (13
###### per cent), Honduras (10 per cent), Belize (7 per cent) and Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines (6 per cent).

An examination of the subsequent histories of the abandoned ships using
data from the Lloyd's Ship Register for 2000 shows that, of the abandoned
ships reported here, 14 were broken up and two were a total loss, their
shipwrecked crews subsequently being abandoned. Thirty-five of the 97 ships
were subsequently reflagged, more than 70 per cent of them to Belize,
Cambodia, Malta, Panama, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Sao Tome
and Principe, that is, to flags with both poor abandonment and PSC detention
records. These same flag States also received low ratings in the SIRC Flag State
###### audit 2003.[1][6]

###### Case notes from Sri Lanka, Tunisia and the United Kingdom

This section attempts to summarize abandonment data in a form that
adequately captures the nature of the event itself, the way the event was handled
###### by the relevant agencies, the consequences for seafarers and their families and
the eventual resolution. This is done by looking at three cases recorded in the
###### ITF's files and then by examining a much fuller case study based on the records
of the Mission to Seafarers and further research conducted by the SIRC. This
case study follows the experiences of a single crew between 1997 and 2001 and
is looked at in some detail.

Sri Lanka: Muzaffar Aziz. Registered in Panama. Crew of 14 Pakistanis, eight
Bangladeshi and one Indian. General cargo ship of 8,922 gt, built in 1978.

172


-----

In October 1998, while their ship was in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the crew
members wrote the following "notice" to the Colombo harbour master, the
ITF, the Panamanian Registrar General of Shipping, the Embassies of Pakistan
and India and the Government of Sri Lanka:

This is to bring to your kind notice that we, the following crew members of MV
Muzaffar Aziz, presently at the port of Colombo, have been unpaid for many
months. On account of this, we are facing serious domestic problems. Most of our
families have no money to provide food for our children and to meet education
expenditures. Payment of the children's school fees has been delayed, and most
of the children have been expelled. Some of the crew members whose children are
getting married in the near future have no money to make the necessary
arrangements. These domestic problems have caused all the crew much distress.
Under the present circumstances, the following crew members have finally decided
not to sail the vessel until and unless our wages are paid up to date.

We, the crew members, request the authorities to help us in this serious matter.

The crew's plight went unnoticed and the ship and crew were abandoned
in Lagos, Nigeria, in January 1999 without food, fresh water or gas oil for the
ship's generators. After a year in Lagos and severe problems of sickness among
the stranded crew, the bank holding the ship's mortgage requested that the
ship go back to sea and trade. Following negotiations, about $30,000 were
###### transferred to family members of the crew, although the total sum owed to the
crew amounted to $150,000. The ship sailed to Gibraltar, where once again it
was abandoned by both the company and the bank. In the last communication
received from the ship, the master reported that he intended to sell some of
the ship's spare parts to ensure that the crew had something to eat.

Tunisia: Nablus. Registered in Belize. Crew of nine Ukrainians and four
Indians. A small general cargo ship of 1,530 gt, built in 1966. The owner's
name is unknown but has an address in Turkey.

###### The ship was arrested in Bizerta, Tunisia, in January 1999 by the cargo
owners because of irregularities with the cargo. The crew had not been paid
since October 1998. The agent's fees were also unpaid, although he
###### continued to supply the crew with enough food to keep them from going
hungry.

###### The crew contacted the ITF in London in March. As soon as the crew
had set a legal action in motion to recover their wages, the owner attempted
###### to get them off the ship without paying them and dismissed some of the crew for refusing to join another ship. The local police and port authorities were sympathetic to the plight of the crew and agreed that they should not be sent

173


-----

###### off the ship without having been paid, thereby preventing the crew from
being evicted. The agent eventually withdrew because the expenses he was
###### incurring for supporting the crew were making him bankrupt. The Indian
and Ukrainian Consulates declined to handle the case. The owner made no
###### contact with the ship and the Turkish Embassy in Tunis said that they could not trace the owner.

In April 1999, a local lawyer agreed to act on behalf of the crew, and
money was advanced by the ITF to provide food. The judge informed the
lawyer that a mandate from the crew was not enough and that they should get
one from their countries' representatives, but the respective consulates
refused to sign the lawyer's mandate. After signing the power of attorney
(that is, authorization to the lawyer to act on their behalf), the crew was
repatriated with an advance from the ITF. The ship eventually was sold.
However, as late as November 1999 the crew was still waiting for their claims
###### to be settled.

 United Kingdom: Kherson. Registered in Georgia. Crew of 26 Georgians.
Tanker of 17,824 gt, built in 1978.

The vessel arrived at Avonmouth in the United Kingdom from Port
Sudan, Sudan, in June 1999 with a cargo of molasses. The vessel was detained
by PSC on the day of her arrival. About £12,000 of repair work was needed to
bring the ship up to minimum standards, but since the ship's owner had
accumulated worldwide debts of £80 million, he was unable to provide local
###### contractors with the necessary financial guarantees.
 After the ship had been detained, it became apparent that the owners had not sent any money to the ship for several months and that the crew, who had
been aboard for 12 months, had not been paid for 11 of those months. Food
quickly ran out and the ratings instigated legal proceedings to have the ship
placed under arrest. Initially, there was some conflict between the officers and
ratings regarding the legal action. All the seafarers were concerned about their
families. "We have been working without money for 11 months. We have
families at home but we can't send them anything. We are very poor. It's a very
big problem," said one of the crew.[1][7]

Local people, mainly organized by the missions, helped out by delivering
emergency supplies and organizing social events. Advances on outstanding
wages were paid to crew members by the ITF, while repatriation costs were
paid by the Admiralty Marshal, the British Government's legal agency
responsible for the arrest of the ship. The cost of crew repatriation was also
###### undertaken by the Admiralty Marshal. The last group of 11 seafarers was
repatriated in December 1999. The ship was sold in March 2000, enabling both
the ITF and the Admiralty Marshal to recover their costs.

###### Case study: the OBO Basak

In late 1996, Turkish-owned Marti Shipping managed a fleet of nine ships
###### amounting to 1.1 million tonnes and 10 per cent of the entire Turkish-flagged
fleet. Six of these ships were owned by Marti and three were chartered by the
company.[1][8] Marti formed many one-ship sub-companies sharing the same
addresses and telephone numbers. The company also had offices in the main
Turkish ports and repair workshops in Istanbul, in total employing around 500
people. For many years, the firm operated a system whereby, for tax purposes,
it officially contracted crews for a very tiny salary, giving most of the money
in cash. At various times in 1997 the entire Marti fleet was arrested in different
###### ports around the world.
 The 103,325 dwt, 1973-built and Marti-owned OBO carrier, the OBO
Basak, with a crew of 29 Turkish officers and ratings, was placed under arrest
in Dunkirk, France, on 9 July 1997, in a joint action by creditors. The ship's
ratings only found out that the ship had been arrested a week after the event
###### - the arrest notice had been posted on the ship's bridge (normally kept
locked in port and therefore inaccessible to the crew) in French with no
###### translation - via the Russian captain of another ship in the port who had informed the port chaplain of Dunkirk's Mission to Seafarers, who promptly went aboard the OBO Basak to meet the crew. As a result of the chaplain's intervention, a group of crew members was subsequently able to speak to a French ITF inspector, who arranged for them to sign a power of attorney with an ITF-retained French lawyer. The following day, and acting under instructions from the owner, the captain and chief engineer left the ship, without informing the crew. Two days later the remaining crew members
were faxed notices of dismissal, except for the mate (who had become the
acting master) and three other officers who had not joined the arrest
action. With 23 of the crew now represented by a lawyer, the number of
parties to the arrest of the ship eventually increased to a total of 23, including
a south-east Asian ship-repair company: the owners of the OBO Basak
had left a trail of debt around the world which had finally caught up
###### with them.
 When the ship arrived in Dunkirk, many of the crew had not been
paid for nine months. Food was running out, as was oil for the ship's
###### generators. Despite repeated requests to Marti from the acting master,
no money arrived for the crew or their families. The seafarers finally
successfully appealed on television for assistance from the community,
while the Mission to Seafarers made provisional arrangements with
###### the port authority, who agreed to pay for fuel oil, fresh water and
so on.

175


-----

###### On 12 August, some members of the crew wrote letters of appeal to the
French public to explain why they were taking this action. Here are a few
examples:

I haven't received any wages for the past six months. My wife and children at home
are suffering. They are being looked after by neighbours and relatives. I haven't
even got enough money in my pocket to buy a razor to shave. I don't know what
to do. Please help us!

(motorman)

My family haven't received any money for the past 10 months. My relatives have
been supporting my family but they cannot do it any more. I want to have my
money and go home.

(An AB, who did not say in his letter that his wife had had a baby
and was being held "hostage" by the hospital because
she was unable to pay her bill.)

In the past ten months I have only received $100.1 live in a rented house and my
wife receives expensive medical treatment; my son is doing his unpaid compulsory
military service and I am the only breadwinner. My neighbours cannot support
my family any more. We have been here since 7 July. None of the officials from
the company has come to see us. We have been completely abandoned. The only
news we get from the company, through the second officer, is that "if you take
legal action, you will pay for it". They should not have done this to us. We need
your help. Please, please, please!

(bosun)

###### Around the time that these letters were being written but before they had
been released, copies of a telex were sent to each rating:

In the application of Article 14 of the Maritime Labour Code, your work contract
is ended. In conformity with Article 21 of the Maritime Labour Code, all the
necessary steps have been taken for your repatriation: airline ticket and expenses
for the journey.

If within one week you have not responded to this proposal, in conformity with
Article 25/11 of the Maritime Labour Code, you will lose the provision of
repatriation offered and you will return at your own expense.

The crew was advised not to respond on the grounds that judgement had
###### not yet been given in the Dunkirk court in respect of a hearing to establish the
legitimacy of their claim to be regarded as a creditor and the value of their
claim. They were told that should they return home, they would be
disqualified from their action. Some crew members accepted the company's

176


-----

Sub-standard ships and abandoned seafarers

offer of repatriation but in the event the company did not respond to their
requests and so the claim for creditor status proceeded. The crew's lawyer
argued that, since none of the crew held what could be recognized as a contract
and the case was being heard in a French court, French rates of pay were
appropriate. The court in Dunkirk then ruled that the crew had a legitimate
claim to be regarded as creditors and that the Turkish seafarers should receive
70 per cent of their claims, based on French seafarers' wages.

Soon after the court hearing, the local seafarers' mission, with the
###### support of the ITF, applied to the local immigration office to obtain safe conduct of the crew for repatriation. The immigration office refused on the
grounds that seafarers, having arrived in the country by sea, may only leave by
sea and they had no official documents to say that they could leave the ship.
###### The harbour master also applied to the immigration office to refuse repatriation on the grounds that the ship would not be secure. Eventually, the harbour master agreed that only eight seafarers need remain aboard, provided
he was able to nominate the various ranks required for the safety of the ship.
Meanwhile, the Mission to Seafarers persuaded the immigration authorities to
allow the crew to be repatriated. In the meantime, the crew sent messages by
fax to the Turkish Embassy in Paris asking for help; no replies were received.

###### The last rating from the original crew of the OBO Basak who had arrived with the ship in July finally left Dunkirk on 4 October 1997. Repatriation
costs were met by the ITF and each seafarer received £2,850 in cash as an
advance in the event of a successful claim for unpaid wages. The cash advance
came from the Mission to Seafarers (£200), the ITF (£900) and Dunkirk's Port
###### Authority (£1,750).

A replacement crew of eight stayed on board until the vessel was sold (in
March 1998). Meanwhile, another of Marti's ships, the OBO Selim, had been
placed under arrest in Gibraltar in September 1997 and sold there by the
###### Admiralty Marshal, the British judicial agent acting for creditors in cases of
ship arrest. The crew was repatriated to Turkey without their back pay having
been settled: the company owed them, on average, five months' wages. Five of
the OBO Selim crew members were told by the company that the OBO Basak
was ready to sail after its court case had been resolved. Wages owed to them
would be paid as soon as the ship began to earn money again. However, if they
###### went straight home, they would receive nothing for a long period of time.
Accordingly, they agreed to go to Dunkirk, unaware of the events unfolding
there. Marti had also sent another three seafarers to Dunkirk from Turkey.
The last of these was a new master, who arrived in late January 1998. He had
been told by the company that the ship was about to sail to Istanbul and
had no knowledge of what had been happening in Dunkirk in the previous
six months.

The global seafarer

Box 7.3 Twenty-one [sic] Turkish seafarers abandoned in Dunkirk

Their vessel was arrested, the master disappeared, they are
penniless

There are 28 of them. Twenty-eight Turkish seafarers, unpaid. Abandoned by their
captain and their employer. Ignored by their Government. Virtually prisoners aboard
their ship in the port of Dunkirk. After six weeks, the shipowner           - Marti Shipping           -
has been silent and invisible. The captain of the bulk carrier OSO Basak left the ship
along with the contents of the safe. Shortly after its arrival early in July, the OSO
Basak, whose owners have left a worldwide trail of bad debt, was arrested by the
French authorities at the request of its creditors.

Only after the alarm was raised by an officer of another ship in the port was it
discovered that aboard the OSO Basak there were about 30 penniless seafarers
who had received no wages for nine months. The crew had been afraid to reveal
their situation for fear of reprisals. Pressure had been exerted on them by the
shipowner to keep quiet. Now the Mission to Seafarers and the Franco-British
Seamen's Club are caring for the crew by coordinating food and other provisions
supplied by local voluntary organizations. The port authority has provided the ship
with water and fuel.

Aboard ship the crew works normally so that, if necessary, the OSO Basak could
sail immediately. Until a few days ago none of the crew dared leave the ship for fear
that by doing so they would forfeit their chances of getting the wages owed them.
A Dunkirk lawyer, who is giving his services free of charge, has now assured them
that they can return home without jeopardizing their chances of being paid. "Return
to Turkey? But with what money?" asks a member of the crew. According to the
Reverend Tony Rimmer, Chaplain of the port of Dunkirk, the ITF has agreed to pay
their fares after an embarrassing silence from the Turkish Embassy. Back in Turkey,
the situation for the majority of the families is serious. Without any income, some
families have had their electricity supplies cut and others face eviction from their
houses and apartments. "What is happening to us is less serious than it is for our
families," says the electrician of the OSO Basak. "Here, thanks to the solidarity of
the different associations, we can live more or less in a normal way, but our families
have nothing."

Dunkirk's commercial court has ruled that the shipowner has until December to
reach an agreement with his debtors, who are owed some Ffr30 million [US$4.8
million]. Otherwise, the bulk carrier, which has a value of US$4 million, will be
auctioned. Even then the crew will have to wait some months before receiving their
wages. According to the Reverend Rimmer, abandonment of ships and crews is all
too common. Last year, around 50 vessels were arrested in French ports, most of
them with unpaid crews and shortages of food and supplies. "We will shortly be
meeting the EU Commissioner for Transport to see if we can organize a solidarity
fund for the abandoned crews. We have to hope that European pressure on ships'
flag states will make them accept their responsibilities," says Tony Rimmer.

Sub-standard ships and abandoned seafarers

In a separate development, the ITF has asked the French Government not to ratify the
Franco-Turkish Commercial Convention drafted by the Alain Juppé Government. This
proposed that commercial disputes between Turkish citizens in France would not be
heard by French courts. An indignant Tony Rimmer said: "If this Convention is ratified
it would mean that the courts would not be able to intervene in cases like that of the
OSO Basak."

Source: Libération (Paris), 17 Aug. 1997.

###### In January 1998, the Basak's electricity, supplied from ashore by the port
authority, was cut off. Since there was no fuel aboard for the ship's generator
and therefore no adequate heating and lighting, the health of the remaining
crew rapidly deteriorated in the winter months. One crew member became so
ill that he had to be repatriated. Another was badly bruised following a fall on
deck. Lacking access to health care, the local Turkish community "lent" the
papers of a local resident to the injured man so that he could receive
professional medical treatment.

The OBO Basak's crew was involved in a series of court cases, the last of
which is still ongoing. The first case was heard in a local court and established the
right of the crew to be considered a creditor, along with the other parties who
had initiated the arrest of the ship and stood to gain from any subsequent sale.

Marti Shipping, however, took the local court's ruling to the Court of
Appeal in Douai. The appeal was upheld, with the court ruling that under a
###### treaty agreement between France and Turkey, claims by Turkish citizens
against other Turkish citizens had to be heard in Turkish courts. The French
lawyer then advised that the Appeal Court ruling could be successfully
challenged in the Supreme Court, but that he was not qualified to conduct
cases at that level. Therefore, the Mission to Seafarers in Dunkirk asked the
###### ITF to provide the funding for a study to evaluate the prospects of a successful
appeal, to which the ITF agreed.

Meanwhile, the sale of the ship had been postponed by about six months
because of the appeal by Marti. In March 1998, the ship was finally sold at
auction for Ffr 9.2 million upon which the port presented a Ffr 8.5 million bill
###### for port dues. Since in French law state bodies are privileged creditors,
virtually the whole of the proceeds of the sale went to the port authority.

###### The arguments put by the seafarers' legal representatives to the Supreme Court were based mainly on the Brussels Convention of 10 May 1952,
according to which, in matters of international law, the jurisdiction before
which the claim should be brought is that in which the attachment of the
vessel took place     - France in this case     - and only then if another condition of
###### determining jurisdiction is fulfilled. For the purposes of this case, the other

The global seafarer

relevant criterion was that the debt was created during the course of the
###### journey during which the seizure took place.

The Supreme Court accepted this argument and decided that:

looking at Article 7 I c of the Brussels Convention of May 10, 1952, which
harmonizes various rules on the "saisie conservatoire" (i.e. protective attachment)
of a sailing vessel;

according to the terms of the text, the national courts of the State in which the
seizure of the vessel took place are competent to judge the merits of the case, as
long as the debt is created during the course of the journey during which the
seizure took place;

the Court of Appeal decided that the French courts were not the appropriate
jurisdiction to hear the claims for unpaid wages of the sailors of the OBO Basak,
which was the object of the seizure in the port of Dunkirk, notably at the demand
of these creditors.

As such, the Court of Appeal misapplied the Article.
This decision on the question of jurisdiction was an important one as it
could set a precedent for all future cases involving foreign seafarers in France.
However, there needs to be an additional court case to secure this. The
Supreme Court's ruling applies only to this particular case unless and until the
###### court rules that this particular judgement is acceptable as a precedent. At the
time of writing, the court case was still continuing and the chances were high
###### that the seafarers would win and obtain indemnities in accordance with French
law; however, this would only be a technical victory for the OBO Basak crew
because no financial compensation for lost wages would ensue. However, a
successful outcome would establish legal principles capable of improving the
rights of foreign seafarers abandoned by their employer in France.

A similar case came to court in France at around the same time. A
Romanian vessel, Oscar Jupiter, was abandoned and then placed under arrest
in Nantes in January 1998. In 1999, the Court of Appeal of Rennes ruled
similarly to the Dunkirk Appeal Court in the case of the OBO Basak, saying
###### that the crew could have no claim in respect of wages in a French court and that the case should be heard in the Industrial Tribunal of Constanta,
Romania.[1][9] The Romanian crew was repatriated without being paid wages due
###### to them.

The crew of the OBO Basak returned home to find their families in
difficult circumstances. They had been away for between six and eight months
###### without pay and now faced the possibility of being blacklisted and without work for months. Indeed, in many cases their return home was no less difficult than their detention in Dunkirk. One crew member reported;

180


-----

Sub-standard ships and abandoned seafarers

When I returned from Dunkirk, the family was relieved and very pleased to see
me. All the time they asked questions about what had happened in Dunkirk. "How
did you survive?", "How was morale on board?"        - things like that. When we were
in Dunkirk, when we could not easily communicate with our families, we both
played down to each other our real problems so as not to worry each other. But a
couple of days after my arrival home, I faced the reality and I felt cheated,
humiliated by the company. There was pressure on me to start working
immediately as there was no money, nothing to eat, and creditors were visiting the
house all the time. Then the arguments started. "Why did I stay there that long?"
"Why didn't I leave the company earlier?" I remember smashing the glass door in
the living room with frustration after one of these arguments.

This situation was not exceptional. Most of the families had no money.
###### They had borrowed from extended families, friends and neighbours. Since the
company had not paid the crew's national insurance contributions for two
years, they had no health cover and had to pay all their medical care
themselves. Several had had their furniture and personal effects removed by
bailiffs. Many had been told by their landlords to leave. Telephones had been
disconnected, which, apart from making communicating home extremely
difficult while they were in Dunkirk, also meant that, once home, it was
difficult for prospective employers to get in touch with them.

Wives had borrowed money from neighbours so that they could travel to
the company's offices to try to get some of the money owed to them; one wife
travelled for 12 hours and another for eight. At the offices, some were verbally
abused by the staff and only occasionally given small sums    - sometimes not
even enough to pay the ferry home. Others took their sick children along to
show how needy they were and to try to shame the company into paying.
Some of the women were given post-dated cheques that bounced.

Several families became dependent on the goodwill of neighbours, who
gave them second-hand furniture, mattresses and so on. All the wives had run
up debts with their local shops and one wife spoke of a trader who had offered
###### to cancel the debt if she would sleep with him. Neighbours no longer called in,
suspecting that families would ask for yet more money. This meant that many
of the families became steadily more isolated in their own communities.

###### The circumstances of the OBO Basak's crew are typical of many other
cases, except that in this particular instance the crew had been "fortunate
###### enough" to have been abandoned in a port with efficient and experienced
seafarers' welfare services. The port chaplain, well-known for his organizing
skills, was able to develop a programme of coordinated action with other
agencies and generate front-page publicity in the French national press.

As this discussion of cases of abandonment shows, the central issues that
need to be dealt with are ensuring that repatriation is quickly arranged and that

181


-----

The global seafarer

wages owing are paid. It may well be true that wage claims can often require
juridical interpretation, but it is clear that there are no existing instruments that
make direct solutions available to crew members. In the circumstances, they
may, therefore, have no alternative but to engage in the cumbersome
procedures involved in arrest and civil actions, even though stranded crew
members will have neither the financial resources nor the local legal and
political knowledge to pursue a claim. And when there are no provisions in local
legislation for the nomination of parties responsible for the welfare of the crew
during the period of abandonment or voluntary organizations are poorly
organized or non-existent, seafarers are usually left to look after themselves.

###### Towards global protection

The immediate issues faced by abandoned seafarers are few in number and
uncomplicated: all that abandoned seafarers need is to be provided with food
and accommodation and competent socio-legal advice, while arrangements are
made for them to be repatriated and any wages owing paid. But if their needs
and the necessary arrangements to meet them are themselves straightforward,
the difficulties quickly become apparent once the multiplicity of institutional
practices and legal systems and precedents that are to be found in the ports
and States of the world and the absence of globally uniform procedures for
dealing with abandonment are taken into account.

Below is a list of ILO and IMO Conventions and other international
treaties that contain provisions relevant to the abandonment of seafarers:

###### ILO Conventions

          - Repatriation of Seamen Convention, 1926 (No. 23)

         - Repatriation of Seafarers Convention (Revised), 1987 (No. 166)

         - Seafarers' Identity Documents Convention, 1958 (No. 108)

###### Protocol, 1996] (No. 147)

       - Seafarers' Welfare Recommendation, 1987 (No. 173)

###### IMO Convention

       - Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976

###### International treaties

       - International Convention on the Arrest of Ships, 1999

       - International Convention on Maritime Liens and Mortgages, 1993

       - UNCLOS, 1982

The ILO Repatriation of Seamen Convention, 1926 (No. 23), ratified by
45 States since 1926, was put in place to try to ensure the repatriation of
seamen landed in foreign ports due to desertion, sickness or imprisonment
###### rather than abandonment. Although establishing a seafarer's right to repat-
riation, it failed to specify who was to pay. However, the Repatriation of
Seafarers Convention (Revised), 1987 (No. 166), expressly places the
###### responsibility onto the shipowner. The problem, however, is that, in cases of abandonment, the shipowner tends to disappear, making the recovery of
expenses advanced by the port State or the country highly unlikely. According
###### to this Convention, it is only when shipowners fail to meet their obligations
to repatriate that the State in which the ship is registered becomes responsible.
###### If the flag State then fails in its obligations, the seafarers' country of origin or
the country in which they are stranded may repatriate and, in doing so, is
###### entitled to recover the cost from the ship's flag State. A survey of national repatriation laws, conducted by the Center for Seafarers' Rights, shows that, although most countries have placed the responsibility for repatriation on the
shipowner, there seems to be no clear mechanism for determining when
shipowners may be deemed to have failed in their duty to repatriate.

###### The Recruitment and Placement of Seafarers Convention, 1996 (No.
179), is another relevant Convention but it does not require the placement
(crewing or manning) agencies to repatriate. The subject matter of the
Shipowners' Liability (Sick and Injured Seamen) Convention, 1936 (No. 55),
is only partially relevant. With regard to the Protection of Wages Convention,

183


-----

The global seafarer

1949 (No. 95), and the Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's
Insolvency) Convention, 1992 (No. 173), which cover all workers, employees
are ranked as privileged creditors, but the Conventions do not specify that
crew members should receive all wages due. It is also worth noting that the
###### International Convention on Maritime Liens and Mortgages, 1993, gives liens for crew wages lower priority than other claims. Where wage questions are
concerned, the ILO Protection of Wages Convention, 1949 (No. 95), and the
###### Protection of Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency) Convention, 1992
(No. 173), are not suited to the question of wage payment defaults by
employers. It would be administratively and politically difficult for flag States
###### to meet wage defaults from public funds and even more difficult in the case of port States. Public accountability would certainly require the retrieval of
defaulters' funds from the original defaulter, that is, the shipowner, and it is
###### not clear how these claims could be effectively and economically pursued. It
would be difficult for States to undertake responsibility to pay seafarers' wages
from public funds. In short, and taking together the various instruments noted
in this paragraph, none is appropriate to cases of abandonment.

###### It is often pointed out that, whereas IMO instruments, which have an
essentially technical content, have been ratified by more than 100 States, less than
half that rate of ratification has been achieved by ILO instruments, the contents
of which are primarily socio-economic. This disparity can be explained by the fact
that, without the certification signifying compliance with IMO Conventions,
ships as structures would be unable to engage in worldwide trades. States are,
therefore, effectively obliged to ratify these instruments, particularly now that
PSC regimes can enforce compliance. Uniquely among ILO maritime instru-
ments, the wide acceptance of the Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards)
###### Convention, 1976 (No. 147), stems from the fact that it was made mandatory
and enforced by the member States of the Paris MOU on PSC.

A few of the ILO maritime Conventions are more than 40 years old and
do not entirely address current global shipping conditions. On the other hand,
some of the more recent international instruments that do have potential
relevance for abandonment issues, such as the 1993 International Convention
on Maritime Liens and Mortgages and the 1999 International Convention on
the Arrest of Ships, have yet to receive ratification to bring them into force.

###### In addition to the ILO and IMO Conventions and other international
treaties, some flag States have insurance schemes and special funds to deal with
cases of abandonment. Globally, however, there are no effective insurance
schemes that provide support during abandonment and cover the payment of
wages owing and repatriation. For example, Liberia requires its vessels to carry
###### P&I insurance or to prove financial responsibility to cover repatriation
problems. However, the Liberian administration's experience has shown that

184


-----

Sub-standard ships and abandoned seafarers

this system can still fail: although Liberia requires annual proof of financial
responsibility, unscrupulous shipowners can allow their insurance to lapse,
which would probably only be discovered by the authorities after a problem
had arisen.[20]

###### Under Norwegian legislation, shipowners are responsible for repatriation
costs and the payment of the crew's wages in the event of the owner's
bankruptcy. Every shipowner belonging to the NIS has to provide a guarantee
###### that the seafarers will be repatriated and that eight weeks of their wages will be
paid; any ship that fails to meet these requirements will be removed from the
register. Singapore has a specific fund to assist seafarers stranded on ships
abroad (the Singapore Stranded Seafarers' Fund). These provisions are
valuable but the global nature of the shipping industry means that seafarers
need globally recognized protection against abandonment. Positive moves in
this direction are currently being made by the ILO and IMO.

###### Three sessions of a Joint IMO/ILO Ad Hoc Expert Working Group on
Liability and Compensation Regarding Claims for Death, Personal Injury and
###### Abandonment of Seafarers were held between 1998 and 2001. At the end of
the third session a draft resolution and associated guidelines were finalized.
The draft resolution on providing financial security in case of abandonment
states that "abandonment of seafarers is a serious problem involving a human
and social dimension and recognizes that, given the global nature of the
shipping industry, seafarers need special protection".

The issue is straightforward: if shipowners are not properly financially
secured, seafarers may not receive remuneration due or be promptly
repatriated. The resolution acknowledges the core of the problem by affirming
###### that provision for repatriation, maintenance while abandoned and payment of
wages due should form part of the seafarer's contractual and/or statutory
rights and should not be affected by the failure or inability of shipowners to
meet their obligations. The resolution also recognizes that, in cases where
shipowners fail to meet their obligations, flag States and, in some cases, the
State of which the seafarer is a citizen or the port State, can be expected to
intervene.

###### The resolution's guidelines propose that shipowners should have in place
an adequate financial security system to provide for repatriation expenses
###### without any cost to the seafarer and for the maintenance of the seafarer from
the time of abandonment to the time of arrival at the place of repatriation. It
might take the form of a social security scheme, an insurance scheme, or a
national fund. The seafarer should have a right of direct access to the financial
security system, which should apply to all seafarers irrespective of nationality.
The payment of all outstanding remuneration and contractual entitlements
should be covered, as well as the payment of other expenses incurred by the

185


-----

The global seafarer

seafarer during the period of abandonment and arising from it, including
repatriation.

The guidelines also state that shipowners should ensure that ships engaged
on international voyages should hold a certificate attesting to the existence of
a financial security system in the event of abandonment of seafarers and that it
should be posted in a prominent position. Shipowners should also display the
###### contact details of the people or entity responsible for handling claims covered
by the guidelines.

The final resolution and guidelines were adopted by the IMO at its 22nd
Assembly in November 2001 to take effect from 1 January 2002.[21] However,
###### IMO resolutions and guidelines are not mandatory and have no legal effect until promulgated in States' law. States normally consult interested parties
before implementing resolutions and guidelines and, at the time of writing, the
###### outlook was not good. Many P&I Clubs publicly announced that they would
find it impossible to comply with all the terms of the guidelines.[22] In a
###### submission to the ILO's Legal Committee, representatives of the International Group of P&I Clubs declared that clubs could not attest to
certificates that stated that the insurance would:

          - notify seafarers of the cancellation or non-renewal of insurance. (It was
###### pointed out that it would not be practicable for clubs to notify individual
seafarers as they do not have crew lists or details of individuals employed
by their members, which, in any event, change on a day-to-day basis. It
was suggested that it would effectively be impossible for any insurer to
comply with such an obligation.)

         - pay all the claims arising during the period for which the certificate is
valid. (It was pointed out that since the payment of claims is always
subject to club rules and members' terms of entry, P&I Clubs could not
comply with this requirement. As far as the insurance system is
concerned, the International Group of P&I Clubs also stated that the
clubs covered most but not all of the shipowner's legal liabilities and that
as a matter of long-standing principle bankruptcy was not covered.)[2][3]

###### It was made clear that if these conditions were retained, Group Clubs
would not be in a position to issue appropriate certificates.

###### Compared with other human rights infringements inflicted on migrant
workers, the scale of abandonment of seafarers is not huge. But in its very
extremity it does illustrate the essential nature of the problem of employment
abuse. Crews are not abandoned or subjected to lesser abuses because of the
moral inadequacies of the abusing parties. Shipowners and their agents do, of
course, have a duty of care for seafarers in their employ and to that extent are

186


-----

Sub-standard ships and abandoned seafarers

culpable when they abandon their crews. However, these owners are also
embedded in the economic and political logic of their industry and if they
operate at the margins of economic and regulatory structures it is inevitable
###### that sometimes some owners will be unable to honour their commitments. Abandonment is unquestionably a callous act. But it is also an act of desperation borne out of desperate circumstances. In general, these
"circumstances" are the (changeable) economic and regulatory structures of
world shipping. It is clear that abandonment is a structural problem that can
only be resolved by the industry. And the Resolution and Guidelines on
Provision of Financial Security in Case of Abandonment of Seafarers adopted
by the IMO goes some way to addressing the problem.

###### CONCLUSION

Lashing containers, homeward bound

###### There have always been serious and well-informed people in the various branches of the shipping industry who have understood the critical importance of recruiting and then sustaining a resourceful and highly motivated seafaring workforce. There have also been periods in the modern
epoch when the ambition of professionals operating ships with all-round
excellent crews, from shipmasters and chief engineers to motormen and
messmen, has been as close to attainment as could reasonably be expected.
Few with long enough memories would disagree that a high point in these
respects was achieved in the 1950s and 1960s, a period of relative stability and
###### historically high rates of growth in world trade during which companies
widely known internationally for operating good ships and based in nations
###### with respected maritime administrations effectively set standards of best
practice. Not all companies and their ships either aspired to or attained those
###### standards and there were often substantial differences between the best and the worst. However, there was a floor and it was not so low that prominent industry figures felt the need to speak publicly about sub-standard ships and the need to drive them out. During that "high point of standards" period, shipping companies, seafarers and the entire support infrastructure of insurers, classification societies and maritime administrators together formed national shipping communities with powerful legal and normative
means to ensure that the floor was high enough to keep out sub-standard
###### shipowners.

189

The global seafarer

The socio-legal mechanisms that encouraged high operational standards
and set limits designed to mitigate the damaging effects to seafarers and
professional shipowners of execrably unprofessional competitors collapsed
###### under the weight of the recession of the 1980s and the ensuing rush to deregulate. Flagging out, usually to regimes devoid of maritime
administrations as well as commercial, social and political infrastructures,
freed owners from legal and normative restraints and left them to determine
for themselves their own levels of professional standards. This led to what was
later described by the investment bank Warburg Dillon Read as a period of
"valiant but mutually destructive competition", during which serious
professionals knew perfectly well that best-practice standards were on the
slide. That period now belongs to history, but like all significant events of the
recent past, it has left its mark. The desperation of that time is still vividly felt
by those who lived through it, while the organizational transformations that it
###### produced - arguably the most significant since the transition from sail to
steam 120 years ago       - can be seen as the industry moves steadily towards
global regulatory regimes.

###### In the rapidly developing global epoch, the shipping industry no longer trades internationally from highly organized national bases where all
shipping activities are interrelated. Shipowners and seafarers still have
###### national identities: as corporate entities or individuals, they are attached to particular States. But this sense of attachment to a State is often nominal. For shipowners, the location of their command activities in a particular State is principally determined by convenience or contingency and is mostly
irrelevant to the way business is conducted and the ships managed. The
###### situation for seafarers is similar, since most of the ships they sail in are registered to States which for them are irrelevant. On the other hand, living
at sea is merely an alternative to living somewhere else, typically the
###### seafarer's State of origin. Seafarers are attached to their origins because
where they come from is where they are rooted. Their attachment to their
###### home State is not a matter of convenience or contingency; it is compulsively
personal. Of course, these same personal attachments also apply to shipping
###### company executives as private individuals, but not in the case of the corporate entity that they are charged with managing. Companies as
companies in the global epoch cannot afford to have unequivocal national
###### attachments. Seafarers as seafarers cannot afford not to have them. A recent French book on the lives of merchant seamen has the title Ni morts, ni
vivants: marins!, which translates as Neither dead nor alive: sailors![1] Once
aboard ship, there is indeed a sense in which seafarers are neither dead nor
alive because they mortgage the present against the future expectation of
living fuller lives during their periods of return. Seafarers also incur other

190


-----

###### opportunity costs. A recent analysis of risk exposure incurred by shipping industry stakeholders shows that the risks for seafarers are substantially higher than for any other interested party.[2]

The lack of equivalence between the shipowner as a corporate entity and
the seafarer as a private individual may today be inescapable, but it does not
follow that it is in the interest of shipowners to ignore the fact that seafarers
also have a collective existence, which consists in the pool of skills and
experiences they hold and on which shipowners depend completely. Without
crews, ships are, after all, merely inert and useless artifacts. Accordingly,
shipowners have a powerful interest to ensure that they can recruit and then
retain crews with the necessary range of talents.

This interest in the condition of the labour force becomes more or less
apparent according to the extent to which shipowners are faced with financial
crises and, in those moments, are able to employ significantly cheaper crews.
###### One of the more important facts of globalization as it has occurred in shipping
is that it would not have happened at all if shipowners had been unable to
change their sources of seafaring labour. Now that the industry has become
global, it can no longer switch rapidly to new sources of supply. This is partly
because, in the short term, sufficiently large new sources of suitable labour are
###### not available.[3] It is also because the process of globalization itself, coupled with
significant developments in domestic politics in many parts of the world, has
led to the emergence of what, for want of better words, might be described as
a global regulatory system increasingly focused on labour issues.

To reiterate, globalization was first the result of the crisis in shipping of
the 1980s. Entirely coincidentally, this crisis overlapped at each end of that
decade with the arrival of the environment as a political issue and a sequence
of large pollution incidents involving tankers in Europe, North America and
Japan.[4] Two of these incidents were especially important. The stranding of the
Amoco Cadiz off the coast of northern Brittany in 1978 led directly to the
creation of Europe's PSC regime (the Paris MOU) and subsequent emulation
by alliances of countries in other world regions, notably in the Pacific (the
Tokyo MOU). The stranding of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in 1989 speeded
up the growth, reach and deterrent policies of the new PSC organizations
specifically aimed at ridding the markets of sub-standard ships of all types. It
###### spurred the oil majors to regulate, decisively and effectively, quality standards
in the tanker market through its SIRE system and provoked the Government
of the United States into creating legislation to ensure that double-hulled
tankers are adopted worldwide. These developments all came on stream in the
1990s as the industry emerged from the wasteland of the 1980s and, in the
###### manner of all survivors, began to take a critical look at itself. The main issue
was obvious: the importance of having skilled seafarers.

The global seafarer

The BIMCO/ISF-sponsored studies on supply and demand, published
serially throughout the 1990s, unerringly focused on the training deficit and
the growing probability of shortages of well-trained officers of the 1980s.
###### Industry professionals, many of them trained in the "high point of standards"
era, found that many of the new recruits had been inadequately trained and
even held corrupt certification. These experiences led to the 1995 revision of
the IMO's STCW Convention of 1978 (fully implemented in 2002) and an
###### IMO-sponsored study of fraudulent certification, reported in 2001. Behind
the scenes in all these and other activities at the IMO and ILO, ad hoc alliances
between national delegations, shipowner organizations, insurers, classification
societies and trade unions met. As the levels of contact and deals done
between them rose, so did it begin to look as if the key aspects of the
regulatory regimes of the older and more embedded maritime nations were
beginning to reappear, this time on a global stage. This perspective was
reinforced in 2000 with a collective bargaining agreement between IMEC and
the ITR It was further consolidated by the agreement reached between
employers and trade unions at the ILO's 2001 meeting of the Joint Maritime
###### Commission with the aim of reviewing all ILO Conventions concerned with
the living and working conditions of seafarers. In the meantime, the IMO
###### implemented new measures to improve safety at sea with its 2002 International Safety Management Code, conducted under its aegis an
extensive set of risk assessment studies of bulk carriers and launched
discussions on the proper responsibilities of flag States.

The consolidation of companies to form larger units and tactical
commercial alliances in pools have all helped the tendency towards greater global
regulation. Pools do not entail any kind of merging of management practices but
they do bring companies into closer relations with each other and help to establish
common understandings of good practice. Where crewing is concerned, mergers
obviously help to establish a wider reach of good practice when they are between
close equals that are each positioned towards the top end of their markets. There
have been a number of extremely significant mergers among container, tanker,
car carrier, chemical tanker and reefer companies and there can be little doubt that
the net effect has been to stabilize the labour market. These larger companies all
expect consolidations to help them to establish greater market share and to
compete as much on quality grounds as on price. This has eventual benefits for
seafarers, because big companies competing with each other for quality delivery
understand the critical importance of reliable crews and, therefore, begin to think
strategically about their seafarers. As do the larger ship-management companies
###### - and for exactly the same reasons.

This rediscovery of strategic thinking         - it was, after all, strategic thinking
on labour issues that was a characteristic of the best-practice companies of the

Conclusion

1960s and 1970s     - must, however, be conducted on a global scale. This book has
###### put great emphasis on the global labour market for seafarers for the good and
simple reason that it is there and is likely to prove permanent. The structure and
###### multinational composition of that market is now too established to change
rapidly and it follows that the ability of crew managers to choose single
###### nationality crews will be increasingly restricted. Crew managers will, therefore,
accumulate more and more experience of mixed nationality crews and the more
experience they have, the more likely they are to favour them. The corollary of
this for seafarers' trade unions is that, although they will continue to be
nationally based, they will be increasingly obliged to act like transnational
###### organizations. This is another development that should contribute to integrating the network of organizations and associations that bring stability
and order to the industry to the benefit of everyone in world shipping.

3 This shortage of new labour is not a real shortage in the sense that it would be hard to find people willing to work in
the industry. Potentially, there are millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America who would need little
inducement, provided there were IMO-approved training schemes in their countries or regions.
4 The incidents involving bulkers, which caused far greater loss of life, only attracted significant attention within the
shipping industry because of the persistence of the Derbyshire Families' Association, the British seafarers' trade unions,
the ITF and Lloyd's List journalist, Michael Grey.
