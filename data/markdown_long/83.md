## The Player Piano and Musical Labor

By the early 20th century the machine aesthetic was a well-  established and dominant interest that fundamentally transformed musical performance and listening practices. While numerous scholars have examined this aesthetic in art and literature, musical compositions representing industrialized labor practices and the role of the machine in music remain largely unexplored. Moreover, in recounting the history of machines in musical recording and reproduction, scholars often tend to emphasize the phonograph, rather than the player piano, despite the latter's prominence within the newly established musical marketplace. Machines and their music influenced multiple areas of  early  20th-  century  musical  culture,  from  film  scores  to  popular  music and even the concert  hall.  But  the  opposite  was  also  true:  industrialized labor practices changed the musical marketplace and musical culture as a whole. As consumers accepted mechanical replacements for what previously required an active human laborer, ghostly, mechanical performers labored tirelessly in parlors, businesses, and even concert halls. Although the player piano failed to maintain a stronghold in the recorded music marketplace after 1930, the widespread acceptance of recording technologies as media for storing and enjoying music indicates a much more fundamental societal shift. This book explores that shift, examining the rise and fall of the player piano in early 20th-  century society and connecting it to the digital technologies of today.

Allison Rebecca Wente is Assistant Professor of Music at Elon University, where she teaches Music Theory. Her research focuses on mechanical music, especially the role of the player piano in the early 20th century.

## Introduction

The  cartoon  shown  in  Figure  0.1  comes  from  John  Philip  Sousa's  1906 article 'The Menace of Mechanical Music.' In it, two anthropomorphized phonographs  and  a  push-  up  player  piano  with  its  large-  toothed  mouth agape advance toward the viewer while the piano roll trails behind in the wind. Sousa's article  critiques  phonographs  and  player  pianos  alike,  and he  claims  it  is  'simply  a  question  of  time  when  the  amateur  disappears entirely,  and  with  him  a  host  of  vocal  and  instrumental  teachers,  who will  be  without  field  or  calling'  (280).  But  the  player  piano  did  not  rob concert  pianists  of  their  jobs.  Instead,  it  provided  incidental  accompaniment to commercial establishments and an in-  home supplement to concert performances,  a  source  of  domestic  entertainment  for  middle-  class  families. Moreover, concert pianists and famous composers capitalized on the player  piano  by  creating  arranged  rolls  of  orchestral  works  or  reproducing piano-  roll performances that could be sold nationwide. For example, Sergei Rachmanino/ff recorded for Ampico; Igor Stravinsky made rolls for the  Pleyel  Company  in  Paris  and  the  Aeolian  Company  in  London  and composed his Étude pour Pianola specifically for the player piano; George Antheil  composed Ballet  Mécanique for  16  synchronized  player  pianos; Paul Hindemith, Ernst Toch, and Gerhart Münch all premiered works for mechanical piano at the 1926 Donaueschingen chamber music festival; and composers like Felix Arndt and Zez Confrey composed and recorded rolls of  virtuosic  ragtime  works  (Suisman  2012,  244).  Outside  of  parlors  and concert  halls,  player  pianos  labored  tirelessly  in  saloons,  movie  theaters, restaurants, dance halls, roller rinks, and department stores, or even in the streets luring in passersby. 1

The  player  piano  emerged  at  a  time  when  many  consumers  were  open to,  and  fascinated  by,  technical  innovations.  Industrialized  manufacturing practices  and  the  mechanical  improvements  that  took  place  in  the  early 20th  century-  due,  at  least  in  part,  to  the  technological  pressures  of  the First  World  War-  led  countries  like  the  United  States  through  what  John E. Kasson calls 'a pivotal transition from an economy organized around production to one organized around consumption and leisure as well' (Kasson

"Does it go about to seek whom it may devour? "

1978,  106). 2   Transformations  in  manufacturing  and  industry-  Taylorism, scientific  management,  mass  production,  assembly  lines-  carried  over  into the cultural sphere wherein the production and consumption of mechanical instruments and piano rolls soared.

One of the main themes in this book is the shifting role of labor in musical practices, especially as it manifests in mechanical musical labor. In the early 20th century, American factories restructured their labor practices and forever  changed  the  definition  of  'productivity.'  Frederick  Winslow  Taylor championed a system of labor that emphasized e/fficiency in obtaining the end result. Scientific management analyzes larger tasks into component tasks until they are simple enough to require only relatively unskilled laborers. Laborers then carry out the same task each day in a desubjectivized mechanization of what may have formerly required one highly skilled laborer. This is the process of deskilling. Taylor's system (and slightly later the Model T assembly lines of Henry Ford) stems from the American managerial revolution, a revolution at the tail end of the 19th century, led by engineers, that saw success in improving productivity, e/fficiency, planning, and systems in the workplace.

This  book  is  an  exploration  into  how  musical  machines  and  mechanical  music  are  influenced  by  and  consequently reflect industrialized labor practices. Musical practice underwent a fundamental shift in the early 20th

century as music making-  the physical labor of producing sound-  no longer belonged solely to the realm of the performer. The growing popularity of mechanically reproduced music reflected a basic cultural acceptance of this transformation in musical practice. Despite the popularity of mechanical music evidenced by the player piano's dominance over the market through the  early  1920s  and  the  roughly  2.5  million  player  pianos  sold  between 1900 and 1930, scholars of recording have tended to gloss over the player piano in favor of the phonograph (Ord-  Hume 1970, 34). Indeed, David Suisman critiques scholars for their treatment of the player piano as little more than a footnote in the history of sound recording, an odd digital blip in a history almost exclusively focused on the analog (2010, 13).

While scholars such as Suisman have started to raise awareness of the player piano's importance in the history of recording, it remains an underdeveloped  research  area.  Writing  on  the  state  of  player  piano  research, pianolist Rex Lawson claims 'there are one or two museums that treat the player piano as a tourist attraction, but there is virtually no serious academic work done on the subject at all' (2006, 356). This book is a study into  not  only  the  functional  mechanics  of  the  player  piano,  but  also  the cultural milieu that gave rise to it and then largely abandoned it. 3  The dramatic shift in the production and consumption of music, along with general scholarly indi/fference toward mechanical instruments, specifically the player piano, prompts several questions. Why is it that scholarly research so often glosses over or completely ignores the player piano when presenting the history of recorded music? How is it that listeners could move so quickly and with so little apparent resistance from an experience of music that required the presence of the laboring human body to an experience that substituted for this laboring body a form of mediating technology? How, finally, do people's relations to and interactions with music change with the coming of recording technologies? I explore these questions to discern and reveal how the cultural acceptance of technologies for recording music and sound was negotiated. 4

Moreover, I place music written for player piano and other machines into a larger timeline of musical development, connecting machine music to more traditional musical works. Indeed, machines entered the musical landscape much earlier than the Machine Age as it is usually defined (roughly 19181945), and connecting music written for the mechanical performer-  player piano, automaton, etc.-  to works from the 18th- and 19th-  century canon gives under-  acknowledged mechanical music cultural and historical importance. Conversely, recognizing the mechanical origins of and influences on well-  known works points to the validity and necessity of machine music as an area of study. Through an examination of a player piano recording and a phonograph recording of the same time, I form a theoretical framework that contrasts the essentially digital technology of player piano music with  the  analog  technology  of  phonograph  recordings,  the  latter  rapidly

taking  over  the  market  in  the  years  after  1930.  Examining  advertising practices that brought player piano technology into homes and businesses adds weight to the cultural background of the instrument, and analyzing particular compositions written for the instrument fleshes out its technological capabilities. By establishing the player piano as an important part of the development of digital recording technologies, my work reframes and complicates the history of recording technologies while also addressing how mechanization radically transformed the practices and labor economies of early 20th-  century musical culture at various levels.

During the Machine Age, machines and their music influenced multiple areas of musical culture, from film scores to popular music and even the concert hall. But the opposite was also true: Taylor's industrialized labor practices changed the musical marketplace and musical culture as a whole (1911).  In  breaking  down  and  standardizing  labor,  Taylorism  places workers in positions that play to the strengths of the system, rather than those of the individual workers. The individual is dissolved into the mass of  almost  interchangeable  workers,  and  is  thus  absorbed  into  the  labor machine's inner workings. Each chapter of this book addresses a di/fferent aspect of the changing environment of musical labor in the early 20th century.  An  examination  of  advertisements,  recordings,  recording  practices, and  compositions  of  the  time  reveals  the  extensive  impact  industrialized labor had, and continues to have, over musical production and reproduction.  And  as  a  mechanical  instrument  that  achieved  great  success  in  the mainstream marketplace, the player piano is a valuable historical, musical, and cultural artifact that demands more scholarly discussion.

While it is well established that phonograph records (and radio) eventually come to dominate the market for musical recording with the player piano  falling  to  the  wayside,  the  di/fferences  between  these  two  methods of  recording  illustrate  the  theoretical  di/fferences  between  digital  and analog  recording  explored  more  thoroughly  in  Eric  Rothenbuhler  and John Durham Peters' 'Defining Phonography: An Experiment in Theory' (1997, 242-  64). Rothenbuhler and Peters analyze the historical shift from older  sound-  recording  technologies  to  digital  sound  media.  What  they call  'phonography'  includes  all  analog  sound-  recording  devices  such  as cylinders,  discs,  or  magnetic  tape  that  are  specifically  meant  to  convey recorded sound. Digital technologies are meant to store and transmit binary data, not necessarily just sound, and as such no longer contain actual traces of the past (Rothenbuhler and Peters 1997, 255). Suisman elaborates on the distinction by distinguishing the phonograph record's 'sound-  in-  time' from the player piano roll's 'sound-  in-  knowledge.' 5  Both the record and the player piano roll inscribe information-  the record captures a hearing, whereas the roll stores a program of actions-  but each kind of information interacts di/fferently with their respective players. The player piano rolls are a kind of binary data and the rolls work or do not work-  they do not, like the

record, gain a crackling patina, a character that permeates the sound as they age. Rather, atmospheric conditions, small tears in the roll, and operator error lead to flawed player piano performances, or renditions that are obviously marked by the instrument's characteristic mechanical sound (Buchner 1959,  37-  8).  The  phonograph  captures  sound  as  it  occurred  in  time,  as a  particular  instance  of  musical  labor,  and  the  record  bears  scars  earned through its history and heard in its pops and crackles. While the phonograph appears to age gracefully, at least as long as it remains playable, the small tears and operator errors behind a flawed player piano performance seem to cement the player piano's stereotypically mechanical sound, and thus contribute to the instrument's obsolescence.

The philosophical di/fference between the information captured and stored on player piano roll compared with phonograph record is crucial. It is a di/fference of analog and digital sound, and the presence of the player piano's digital storage of data in the early 20th century changes the shape of sound recording's  historical  evolution.  Digital  recording,  in  this  case,  predates analog. While some sources may try to define the span of time during which the player piano becomes irrelevant, 6  I contend that it has no real end point, as its technology has had a profound, if mostly unacknowledged, influence on the digital music of today. Telling the history of recording then requires a focus on digital processes during the player piano's peak, the increasing importance  of  analog  recording  that  becomes  dominant  with  the  introduction  of  electrical  recording  in  the  mid-  1920s,  and  a  return  to  digital beginning in the 1980s with the introduction of CDs and, later, MP3s. The story-  the history of sound recording and digital media-  changes dramatically when the player piano is taken into account. The latest sounds from the tiny gadgets of today have a longer historical background based in a cultural conception that started not in the 1990s, but the 1890s. Indeed, today's digital sounds hearken back to the player pianos of the early 20th century. The crackling of records is hardly a new sound, but historically, analog sound recording is the newcomer when compared with digital player piano rolls. Indeed, as the meticulously punched holes in player piano rolls show, digital technology came first; digital technology is, in fact, vintage.

This  book  begins  with  a  discussion  of  the  concrete  through  examples from Haydn and Schubert and a fleshing out of the  mechanical  musical topic in the early 20th century. It then gradually unwinds into more theoretical  and abstract areas through sonic analyses of recordings, cultural cues as indicated by player piano advertisements from 1900 to 1930, and a detailed discussion of the concept of absolute music in light of mechanical  reproduction. The player piano or machines that make music play a primary role in each chapter, whether through examples of music written for machines, music written to imitate mechanical sounds, or music played by machines, or through a sonic comparison of musical recordings made by player piano and phonograph, a glimpse into marketing the player piano,

or  how  machine  music  augments  and  changes  the  meaning  of  absolute music. 7  A secondary thread running through this book follows the mechanization of labor, or more specifically, the mechanization of musical labor. Although most people are aware that the First World War produced a mechanical and technological boom, how the mechanization of industrial labor influenced  and  shaped  the  mechanization  of  musical  labor  has  not  been much discussed. The sounds of the mechanized industry of the 20th century bled beyond factory walls, and with those sounds came the industrialized labor practices that forever changed the musical marketplace.

Chapter 1 addresses the issue of mechanical music through a topical analysis of the mechanical in music. The chapter defines the musical topic of the mechanical through examples from composers such as Haydn, Beethoven, and Schubert, which form a historical basis of musical representations of the 'machine,' and then develops these topical ideas in examples from the first part of the 20th century. The 20th-  century examples come from film, popular player piano rolls, and the concert hall, and each example falls into one of three categories: music written to sound like or imitate the machine, music written to highlight the skills of virtuoso performers while also showcasing what the machine can do, and finally music written specifically for machines.

This chapter also discusses Frederick Winslow Taylor's theory of scientific management, which was designed to maximize e/fficiency through the analysis  and  streamlining  of  labor,  as  it  relates  to  the  player  piano  as  a labor-  saving device that allows the 'deskilling' of musical labor. Much like factory work of the time, the player piano is not completely automated; but it does require markedly less skill (and somewhat di/fferent skills) and has a higher tolerance for errors by its operator than does a regular piano. In a factory organized according to scientific management, the human body continues to labor despite significant displacements by machines, but the factory requires a di/fferent kind of work-  regulated, operational labor. The labor process essentially bifurcates into manual and intellectual, and most laborers fall into one category or the other. Manual workers complete such mindless tasks as tightening nuts and bolts, whereas intellectual laborers monitor  machines  and  manual  laborers.  The  labor  required  of  a  player piano operator is akin to this intellectual, managerial labor, as the operator oversees the machine as it completes the manual task of playing the instrument. As Taylor's labor practices reorganize factories and the system of production, the sounds of the machine saturate all kinds of music, from the rolls playing at the local saloon to film scores and concert halls.

If recent scholarship has acknowledged a role for the player piano in the history of recording, little work has nevertheless been done in theorizing the di/fferences between the player piano and the phonograph in terms of storing and recreating sound (Ashby 2010; Katz 2004; Suisman 2010 and 2012; Taylor  2007).  In  Chapter  2,  I  analyze  two  1919  recordings-  one  piano

roll  and  one  phonograph  record-  of  Rachmanino/ff  playing  his  own C /uni266F Minor Prelude , illustrating how the two recording mediums emphasize and embody di/fferent ideals. I draw on a November 1927 article from Scientific American , which outlines the recording and editing processes, and accounts in trade papers such as Variety and The Violinist and in standard player piano histories by Arthur W.J.G. Ord-  Hume, Harvey Roehl, Peter Philips, and others to detail the process of editing and perfecting the rolls. As this discussion will show, recording and the ability to store musical performance on roll and record exhibits a fundamentally di/fferent approach toward capturing and storing sound.

In Chapter 3 I analyze advertisements from 1900 to 1930 in order to demonstrate first  how  manufacturing  companies  encouraged  listeners  to accept music played by machine, and second the important role that the player piano played in this advertising campaign. Advertisements catered to  both  sides-  at  some  points  telling  listeners  to  imagine  the  pianist  at the bench and to treat the roll as if it were a live performer, and at others emphasizing  the  uncanny  and  entertaining  spectacle  that  delivers  more than the live performer ever could. The performing body, or lack thereof, provides complex and controversial material for a discussion of interpretation and embodiment of the work. I divide a sampling of advertisements into four categories: (1) advertisements that highlight the machine-  like perfection of the instrument's performances; (2) advertisements that feature player pianos as a labor-  saving replacement for women's labor at the keyboard; (3) advertisements selling player pianos as educational instruments; and (4) advertisements that define the player piano as a device that stores and  reproduces  musical  labor  as  an  ownable  and  stockpile-  able  commodity. This chapter also includes a discussion of invisible labor, using the economic theory and analysis of Alfred Dupont Chandler to draw parallels between overall economic trends and the early 20th-  century player piano market.

Chapter 4 gives three di/fferent snapshots of player piano music composed at di/fferent stages of the instrument's popularity. To set up those examples, first I include an overview of the idea of absolute music as elaborated by Carl  Dahlhaus  and  others  and  show  how  its  definition  is  transformed by-  or perhaps becomes fully realized in-  mechanical reproduction. I use several analyses to illustrate how the mechanical performer influences the composition and performance of a work. The first example is Stravinsky's Étude pour Pianola (1917), from before the instrument reached its highest peak  of  popularity.  Then  I  discuss  several  works  by  composers  such  as Hindemith, Toch, and Casella, all from the 1920s when the instrument was most popular. Finally, I include an analysis of one of Nancarrow's works, composed for player piano in the 1940s after the instrument's popularity had declined. Through these analyses, this chapter addresses absolute music in the age of mechanical reproduction.

Chapter 5 forms a conclusion by pulling in updated connections to the player  piano  and  labor  issues  discussed  throughout  this  book.  Through reorchestrations, film representations, and representations of obsolescence, the player piano comes to represent the technologically quaint, transparent with its visible mechanics and technological simplicity. It is not a coincidence that mechanical instruments and their popularity mirror the industrialized labor practices of the early 20th century; the player piano and mechanical music reflect their time. Before the phonograph's popularity surpassed the player piano's (beginning roughly in the mid-  1920s), the player piano paved the way for recorded music. The instrument's rise and fall forms a necessary historical and theoretical link between live and recorded performance.

## Notes

- 1 Businesses  often  used  orchestrions  in  addition  to  or  instead  of  player  pianos. Orchestrions were large cabinets containing percussion and piped instruments, and,  like  player  pianos  and  other  mechanical  instruments,  they  played  music from perforated rolls or discs. Orchestrions are also associated with ice cream parlors, dance halls, and merry-  go-  rounds, providing the iconic merry-  go-  round sound still used on the rides today (Smith 1994, 48).
- 2 I focus on the United States in this book, but as Sergio Ospina-  Romero explains, the player piano's popularity extended well beyond the United States. He writes, 'The number and reach of advertisements  for  the  instrument,  the  companies involved in the business, and the various available statistics give an idea of how significant  the  trade  in  player  pianos  actually  was  during  the  first  decades  of the twentieth century, but this literature is overwhelmingly in English and refers mostly to North America. To the historiographical mirage in which the player piano  is  usually  overshadowed  by  the  phonography,  as  David  Suisman  has shown, we must therefore add the historiographical illusion that depicts player pianos as only (or mostly) a US phenomenon. Clearly, this was not the case' (2019, 4).
- 3 See also Jean Baudrillard's critique of Siegfried Giedion's 'kind of epic history of the technical object [because it] notes the changes in social structure associated with technical development, but scarcely address such questions as how objects are experienced, what needs other than functional ones they answer, what mental structures are interwoven with-  and contradict-  their functional structures, or what  cultural,  intercultural  and  transcultural  system  underpins  their  directly experienced everydayness' (2005, 2).
- 4 There is a growing body of literature devoted to capitalism and the commodification of culture, most notably analyzed in Jacques Attali's Noise (1985) and later continued in work by scholars such as Timothy D. Taylor in The Sounds of Capitalism: Advertising, Music, and the Conquest of Culture , and the collection of writings edited by Mark Katz, Timothy Taylor, and Tony Grajeda in Music, Sound and Technology in America (2012).
- 5 This distinction is discussed further in Chapter 2 (Suisman 2010, 23-  4).
- 6 For example, Arthur Reblitz writes, 'In the late 1920's when electronic amplification enabled the phonograph and radio to provide musical entertainment at a

fraction of the cost of an automatic piano, the player piano met its demise, and the  economic depression of the 1930's practically wiped out the whole piano industry' (1985, 1-  2).

- 7 A large body of scholarly work already exists addressing recording histories-  I rely on Oliver Read and Walter Welch's From Tin Foil to Stereo: Evolution of the Phonograph (1976), Mark Coleman's Playback: From the Victrola to MP3, 100 Years of Music, Machines, and Money (2003), and William Howland Kenney's Recorded Music in American Life: The Phonograph and Popular Memory, 18901945 (1999)-  and theories of recorded sound and communications, especially Friedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter (1999), Jonathan Sterne's The Audible Past (2003), and Mark Katz's Capturing Sound: How Technology has Changed Music (2004).

Taylorized Labor Practices and Music of the Machine Age 1

## Introduction

The period between the First and Second World Wars earned the title the Machine Age, not only because of the staggering advances in technology and industrial output, but also because of the machine's symbolic role in modern  cultural  and  aesthetic  practices  (Wilson  1986,  23). 2   Machines symbolized everything that  was  modern  and  new,  the  latest  technology; journalist  Alan  Trachtenberg  (1986)  writes,  'the  machine  proposed  not only  a  subject  but  a  means-  exact,  objective  and  logical-  to  cleanse American  art  of  outmoded  styles  and  themes,'  and  scholar  Carol  Oja (2003, 61) writes, 'during the 1920s, the 'machine' came to stand for a staggering array of technological developments.' As film examples from the  time  show,  mechanical  sights  and  sounds  shaped  the  cultural  landscape of the 1920s and 1930s; more specifically, industrialized labor and relentless mechanical noise forever altered modern musical practices and compositions. Beyond the factory, machines saturated musical culture at various levels and played recorded performances to the eager ears of consumers through phonographs, their quality drastically improved through electrically  enhanced  recording  in  1924  (Kenney  1999,  85).  With  sales peaking in 1923, player pianos recreated, as if by magic, the keystrokes made by a pianist long after the player vacated the bench, filling parlors, theaters, saloons and roller rinks with the jangling tunes of Zez Confrey or the impressive virtuosic displays of Claude Debussy or Sergei Rachmanino/ff (McElhone 2004, 26). 3  Some composers, like George Antheil (and later, Pierre Schae/ffer and Edgard Varese, among many others), took the machine and absorbed its sounds, the clinking and clanking of its automatic gears, its rattling engines, its hissing valves and squeaky wheels, and worked them into a concert hall setting in a modern merging of labor and leisure. 4  The sounds of industrialized labor's regulated and percussive rhythms, frenetic pacing,  repetitive  nature,  and  general  indi/fference  to  metrical  hierarchy become features of a kind of musical topic of the mechanical, a topic with various manifestations in diverse contexts. 5

In this chapter, I identify the emergence of a musical topic of the mechanical in various musical examples from the United States and Europe in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, each of which first, illuminates the ways in which industrialized labor influenced music and second, imitates, showcases, or features  the  sounds  of  the  machine.  I  organize  the  machine  sounds  into three  categories:  music  written  to  sound  like  or  imitate  the  machine,  for which I use examples from film scenes featuring a machine in some way; music written to highlight the skills of virtuoso performers while also showcasing what the machine can do; and finally, music written specifically for machines. These three categories correspond with the three main sections of  this  chapter:  Part  1:  The  Machine  on  Screen;  Part  2:  The  Mechanical Novelty; and Part 3: The Mechanical Ballet. The musical examples demonstrate the wide variety of cultural attitudes toward the industrialization of labor. To illustrate music written to sound like or imitate the machine in Part 1: The Machine on Screen, I use examples from film to o/ffer a visual depiction of a machine and its music. Each film example aligns the human and the machine-  or depicts humans as machines-  and the musical accompaniment comments upon the alignment or misalignment of the two. For music written to highlight virtuoso performers and the virtuosic machine, I draw on popular player piano tunes of the time to illustrate the discussion in Part 2: The Mechanical Novelty. And finally, in Part 3: The Mechanical Ballet, I use select pieces from the classical tradition as examples of music written specifically for machines. As the examples discussed in each part will show, the prevalence of machine sounds in music indicates the widespread influence of industrialization and its culturally dominant ideology, Frederick Winslow Taylor's (1911) system of scientific management, which involves a systematic analysis and breakdown of the labor process into small tasks to be carried out by unskilled or moderately skilled workers.

These three categories organize the examples of the musical topic of the mechanical in terms of space . This is not the only way to organize machine music or examples of the musical topic of the mechanical, nor is it meant to be exclusive. But in drawing from disparate musical genres, these examples of 'machine music' encompass a wide variety of audiences and spaces, from the movie theater to the domestic parlor and professional stage, and also a wide variety of performing bodies, from the behind-  the-  scenes film musician to the celebrity virtuoso and established classical performer. Despite their obvious di/fferences in audience, space, and performing body, each example demonstrates a di/fferent aspect of the influence of industrialized labor, and a di/fferent manifestation of the musical topic of the mechanical. Before I discuss examples of machine music from the Machine Age, I will highlight a sampling of examples from earlier music-  including some from the 18th century, a time which Annette Richards (1999, 380) characterizes as 'an age obsessed with traveling curiosities, freaks of nature, automata and virtuosos'-  that form the basis of the musical topic of the mechanical. These

historical examples set the stage for the musical characteristics featured in the  20th-  century  examples  discussed  throughout  the  three  main  parts  of this chapter. As Taylor's e/fficiency-  focused reorganization of labor becomes standard, so also does musical culture assimilate machines and their sounds, leading to a blending of machine and musician in the musical labor process.

## Prelude: Building the Machine

Describing  'machine  sounds'  often  brings  two  situations  to  mind:  one in which the machine malfunctions in some way, spinning out of control, perhaps with blaring  alarms  and  clunking  gears  that  indicate  a  mechanical failure, and another in which the machine operates smoothly, whirring or ticking without incident. Musically, these sounds manifest themselves in various musical features that form the basis for a musical topic of the mechanical,  or  even  through  performers  who  deliberately  imitate  the  smooth, steady function of a machine. The musical topic of the mechanical emerges in recurring musical elements such as an emphasis on percussion and highregister woodwinds, jagged melodies with dissonant leaps that defy musical convention, excessive repetition or perpetual motion (which often manifests in continually repeated notes or gestures), or, contradictorily, as a stable, regular,  minimalist  aesthetic  akin  to  a  steadily  running  engine  or  ticking clock.  Moreover,  some  performers  in  the  late  19th  and  early  20th  centuries deliberately imitated machines in their performances. What follows is an overview of the musical topic of the mechanical in pieces that imitate machines, followed by a brief discussion of first, a 19th-  century performer's imitation of the sewing machine and second, a clock shop musical novelty. 6

The musical topic of the mechanical appears and develops in the 18thand 19th-  century classical tradition, creating a kind of musical foundation of mechanical sounds upon which later examples build. For example, the repetitive eighth notes in the second movement of Haydn's Symphony No. 101 (1794),  shown  in  Example  1.1, 7   earned  the  symphony  its  nickname 'The Clock.' 8   Similarly,  in  the  second  movement  of  Beethoven's Eighth Symphony (1812), the woodwinds carry constant 16th notes that imitate a metronome in a clear demonstration of the musical topic of the mechanical, and the movement ends abruptly without the expected repeat, as if the machine was simply turned o/ff. 9  In addition to musical depictions of the mechanical, well-  known composers from as early as the 18th century were interested in writing specifically for mechanical instruments as performers. Handel wrote for chimes and carillon, and Haydn and Mozart for fluteplaying clock (Fowler 1967, 45).

In  Leo  Delibes'  ballet Coppelia (1870),  an  inventor  creates  a  lifelike mechanical  dancing  doll  who,  along  with  several  other  mechanical  dolls, dances  to Musique  des  Automates .  The  music  features  a  piccolo  melody accompanied by high-  register  woodwinds, violins, viola,  and  glockenspiel

Example 1.1 Ticking clock in Haydn's Symphony No. 101 in D major ,  II,  mm.  1-  5

<!-- image -->

on repetitive eighth-  note figures akin to those in the Haydn and Beethoven works mentioned above. The musical topic of the mechanical appears in O/ffenbach's The Tales of Ho/ffmann (1880) when Olympia, an automaton, performs an aria in which she occasionally stalls out, winds down, and needs to be rewound in order to continue. Musically, Olympia's virtuosic melody stalls on B  and descends chromatically to G  where she stops singing until ♭ ♭ she is rewound. 10  Coppelia and Olympia demonstrate a complex mimetic scenario  of  human  and  machine:  in  each  case  a  human  woman,  the  performer, imitates a machine, itself a mechanical representation of a human.

While some pieces demand that a performer imitate a machine as part of their role, it was not uncommon for performers and pieces to draw on mechanical sounds to create a sense of spectacle. For example, African American pianist  and  composer  Thomas  Greene  Wiggins,  better  known  as  'Blind Tom' and called a 'human music box' by Willa Cather, was known for incorporating imitations of a sewing machine into his performances (Allen

2015, 44-  50). 11 He went so far as to compose Sewing Song (Imitation of a Sewing Machine) (1886), which, after a fantasia-  like opening, maintains a steady stream of 16th notes in the right hand. The piece has a pastoral a/ffect and, despite the piece's title, gives no indication that the 16th notes should remain obsessively regular or mechanistic. Using 16th notes to mark the sewing machine is not without precedent; indeed, steady 16th notes in the right hand indicate the spinning wheel in Schubert's Gretchen am Spinnrade (1814).  Wiggins'  interpretation  of  the  sewing  machine  is  loose  when compared with the mapping of the wheel, bobbin, and pedal of Gretchen's perpetually spinning wheel, which is more similar to the direct imitation found in novelty pieces. 12

Some early musical novelty pieces (often borrowed from band repertory) are more literal in their incorporation of mechanical sounds into an amusing collection  of  sound  e/ffects  (Altman  2004,  383).  Through  sound  e/ffects, pieces like Charles Orth's In the Clock Store (1893), M.L. Lake's In a Bird Store (1916), Moses Tobani's Trip to Coney Island (1899), or J. Bodewalt Lampe's Fun in a Music Store (1921) were meant to musically illustrate the sound e/ffects of each place. Unsurprisingly, In the Clock Store provides a particularly mechanical example of a musical novelty piece. 13  Rick Altman's (2004, 383) summary of In the Clock Store is particularly vivid:

After the apprentice opens the store and winds up the clocks we hear the clocks ticking, the cuckoo clock striking the hour, an alarm clock ringing, the apprentice whistling a tune, a clock with chimes running down, the same clock after rewinding, and Scotch Cathedral Chimes in the distance. 14

Decades later, ensembles would play these novelty pieces to fill the silence between films. 15  Through its musical depiction of an alarm clock, cuckoo clock, and the musical marking of mechanical changes like the rewinding of a clock's gears, the mechanical sounds in In a Clock Store serve as an example of the musical topic of the mechanical just before the Machine Age.

In the 20th century, when the figure of the machine itself attained a new level  of  cultural  power,  certain  mechanical  sounds  such  as  high-  register woodwinds, overemphasized percussion, and excessive repetition became more prevalent as a musical topic of the mechanical. With the development of recording technologies and vastly improved mechanical instruments, moreover, composers who wanted to represent machines musically could draw on the resources of these musical machines, as well as already-  established musical conventions from the classical era. Consequently, they could double the mechanical aspects of music by presenting the mechanical musical topic as played by a machine . Of course, all musical instruments are machines, just as any object that produces sound can technically be considered a musical instrument. In order to provide some boundaries for this chapter, however,

I define musical machines as devices that carry out musical labor or humans acting  as  machines  while  also  creating  music.  Beyond  those  limitations, I deliberately define 'machine' broadly, suggesting that it underpins musical representations of clocks and automatons; music may imitate the machine, like Haydn's clock or the chiming and ticking of In a Clock Store ;  music can represent a machine's movements, as in Coppelia's dance or Olympia's aria; or music may be written specifically for machines, like in works for flute-  playing clock or player piano. When grouped together, these distinct musical representations of machines create an overall musical topic of the mechanical, a topic that experiences an industrial-  sized resurgence in the Machine Age.

## Part 1: The Machine on Screen

For examples of music written to sound like or imitate the machine, my first category, I will use particular scenes from three films: Metropolis (1927), À  nous  la  Liberté (1931),  and Modern  Times (1936). 16 Michel  Chion (2003, 41) connected these three films and the machines they depict when he wrote, 'machines are good when they serve to build a better world. … What Lang (in Metropolis ), René Clair (in À nous la Liberté ), and Chaplin (in Modern Times ) criticized was not machines themselves but the abuses of the Taylorism that they served.' Film examples set music to the visual depiction of a machine, uniting sound and image and further establishing the features of the musical topic of the mechanical. These film scores contain a kind of modified mechanical music, music that borrows particular features of the machine aesthetic in order to reinforce visual actions, or music that signifies 'machine' without the direct and exclusive usage of the machine's sounds. Metropolis , À nous la Liberté , and Modern Times are three films that, despite their distinct settings-  a futuristic energy plant in a dystopic city, an assembly line in a prison, and another assembly line in a factory, respectively-  each depict some kind of organized labor and each indirectly comment upon Taylor's influence on the modern workplace and workforce.

In his 1911 monograph, Taylor, an American mechanical engineer and pioneer in the e/fficiency movement, proposed a labor theory that privileged measurable e/fficiency and productivity that was important to the reorganization of industrial work in the first part of the 20th century. For Taylor, the end result, production, took precedence over creating a rewarding labor process for the worker. He therefore favored designing work for unskilled, unthinking  labor-  labor  organized  so  that  'an  intelligent  gorilla'  could accomplish it (Taylor 1911, 40). In imagining labor as subhuman work, scientific  management  stripped  workers  of  their  subjectivity,  and  so  also of their humanity, re-  rationalizing labor as the work of objective bodies of pure drive, mindless and faceless, trained to mimic to the letter the machines that would replace them. This rationalization followed a two-  step process.

First,  the  production  process  deskilled  labor,  desubjectivized  individuals, and melded them into a mechanized collective body of laborers whose deemphasized  humanity  categorized  them  as  neither  human  nor  machine. These laborers exemplified Taylor's 'intelligent gorillas,' useful only in so far as they could mimic and repeat the same task ad infinitum . Second, the production process modeled this collective body on the machine, and it did so in such a way that as technology improved, eventually an actual machine could replace the collective.

The  industrialization  of  labor  radically  transformed  society,  and  as Michael Hardt (1999, 91) writes, 'society itself was gradually industrialized even  to  the  point  of  transforming  human  relations  and  human  nature. Society became a factory.' The gruesome picture presented in Metropolis and the assembly lines of À nous la Liberté and Modern Times reflect and comment upon Taylor's labor process, warning of the dangers of idealizing unskilled labor. These three films highlight the representation of mechanized labor, the first in workers' repetitive and seemingly meaningless monitoring of the machines, and the second and third in the similarly repetitive and particular labor on the assembly line. The two labors are of the same kind, as both demand first that a worker repeat the same task again and again for an assigned number of hours, and second that the work ends when the clock marks the ending of a shift, not with the completion of a particular product or task. The combined labor of multiple bodies increases production as time-  based work seemingly presents a mechanized living body as the perfect worker. 17  As Richard Guy Wilson (1986, 25) explains, 'even human beings  were  viewed  as  machines  in  the  scientific  management  and  timemotion studies of Frederick Taylor and his disciples'; these films present human laborers and machines as almost inextricable, blurring the boundaries of where the human ends and the machine begins.

Clair's Á nous la Liberté , scored by Les Six member Georges Auric, follows two cellmates first as they labor over toy horses on an assembly line, and later as they make their separate ways outside of prison (Donnellon 2006, 13).  That  the  men  work  on  an  assembly  line  is  important:  together  they create  the  laboring  machine,  and  together  they  embody  Taylorized  labor principles. The prisoners sing as they work, which in a sense humanizes the soundtrack; the music comes from the men, not their labor. Although the music sets the tempo for their labor, its lyrics comment on their imprisoned status.  The  men  sing  ' La  liberté,  c'est  pour  les  heureux (Freedom  is  for the  fortunate),'  and  ' Ah!  …  paignez  ceux  qui  sont.  …  En  prison!  … (Ah! … be sorry for those who are … In prison!)' (Clair 1970, 13, 15). The music's  plodding  compound  duple  meter  acts  as  conduit  for  the  labor  to completely take over the bodies of the men, and the lilting melody, shown in Example 1.2, possesses not only the results of their labor, but also their voices. The least mechanical instrument, the human voice, becomes a part of the laboring assembly line. Later, they sing of their lack of freedom and

Example 1.2 The prisoners' melody, À nous la Liberté (transcribed by author)

plead  for  sympathy  with  ' La  liberté,  c'est  toute  l'existence (Freedom  is everything  in  life)'  and  ' À nous,  à  nous  la  liberté (Give  us,  give  us  our freedom)' (Clair 1970, 16-  17).

The prison  assembly  line  operates  on  a  pre-  or  early  industrial  model based on hand-  held tools and human labor rather than on a literal machine made of metal and gears. Instead, the prisoners are the nuts and bolts of the  machine  while  the  non-  diegetic  simple  flute  melodies  (motivic  ideas taken from the melody shown in Example 1.2) punctuated by occasional snare drum hits serve as a kind of childish military band accompaniment, commenting on the simplistic nature of the prisoners' work. 18  The music in À nous la Liberté ,  written to sound like or imitate the machine, provides the least obvious example of my first category of machine music. À nous la Liberté depicts prisoners who are already considered subhuman by most of society as Taylor's 'intelligent gorillas.' And their music-  like their laboris  simple,  lacking  much  of  the  mechanistic  virtuosity  and  rhythmic  complexity of other examples.

Though the overly simple tasks assigned to prisoners in À nous la Liberté are similar to those of the laborers in Metropolis , their musical and mechanical  setting  is  quite  di/fferent.  Gottfried  Huppertz,  a  German  composer and actor, scored Fritz Lang's futuristic science fiction film called, in its own time, 'a vision of the machine age' (Needham 1928, 46). 19  The film focuses on class divisions, which have become so extreme that classes are separated into physical levels with the highest classes above ground and the workers below. 20   The  film  partitions  the  body  into  head,  intelligent  but  detached managerial labor, and hand, unintelligent and dull line laborers, and thus critiques  modern labor practices for excluding the heart, whose essential rhythmic beating drives the body. The film maps the division of labor and consequently class division allegorically onto the parts of the body. The situation becomes so dire as to require a mediator, the heart, in order to keep the head and hand from separating completely. 21

Example 1.3 Allegro, Stampfende Kolben Metropolis ,

<!-- image -->

Metropolis depicts a dystopic view of the modern industrial age, beginning with its opening scene. After the title sequence, the screen fades and, as shown in Example 1.3, 22  the music quickly shifts to an allegro marked by a spinning chromatic flurry in the upper woodwinds (0:50). The trumpets, brass, and strings pound out minor harmonies on the upbeats, creating a sharp contrast against  the  heroic  and  stable  melody  and  major  key  of  the  title  sequence. Stomping pistons ( Stampfende Kolben ) appear on the screen as the beginning of a montage sequence. The restless pumping of the pistons comes through musically in the o/ffbeat accents and incessant chromatic cycling of woodwind neighbor groups. The steady eighth-  note bass, which seemed comfortable in the title sequence, now adds to the edgy and uneasy quality of this section-  it is at odds with the o/ffbeat accented harmonies, and the two essentially create constant accents at the eighth-  note level. The screen shows a close-  up shot of the pistons as they move up and down, out of sync (in the Kino DVD print) with the accented o/ffbeat eighth-  note harmonies. 23  The misalignment between  music  and  machine  inadvertently  features  the  odd  circumstances surrounding  music  written  to  sound  like  a  machine.  Undoubtedly,  the pistons shown on screen have a particular sound, and yet the music, with its high woodwinds and blaring horns, departs from that sound and instead creates a musical version of a generalized 'mechanical' sound. The regularity of the o/ffbeat accents, the nervously fluttering woodwinds,  and  the blaring horns each take certain aspects of the mechanical-  its regularity and relentlessness, its unpredictability and insensitivity to musical expectationsand apply them to more familiar musical circumstances. The music does not directly map the noise of the machine onto the score; rather, the music picks and chooses certain features of mechanical sound and applies them to create a musical representation of the machine.

The three vertical pumping pistons fade into three horizontal strips of light ( Vertikale Lichtstreifen ) (0:54) that soon reveal a large spinning wheel

Example 1.4 Vertikale Lichtstreifen , Metropolis

<!-- image -->

Example 1.5 agged, dissonant melodic lineJ Metropolis

<!-- image -->

(0:57). Example 1.4 shows the full accompaniment for the strips of light. Shown in Example 1.5, a jagged whole-  tone melody enters, machine-  like in its indi/fference to standard melodic resolutions and practices and featuring the leap of a minor seventh. When stacked, the pitches used in the trumpet's melody  here  create  a  polytonal  e/ffect,  juxtaposing  a  perfect  fifth  based on A against an E +  9 . The dissonant melodic intervals and harmony directly ♭ contradict  the  perfectly  round  and  regular  spinning  wheels  on  screen. Furthermore, the meter shifts from simple quadruple in the stomping pistons section to compound duple for the vertical lights. Later, a hemiola obscures the  meter  with  a  simple  triple  pattern  in  the  bass  against  the  compound duple feel of the woodwinds and trumpet. The layering of dissonance-  of superimposing audiovisual dissonance upon harmonic and metric dissonance-  are characteristics derived from the machine: the music borrows the machine's indi/fference to artistic forms of balance and regularity to give the impression of musical noise.

At times multiple images layer and blur the edges of the mechanism and the pieces appear as independent machines. Each piece tirelessly labors on

screen,  and  yet  the  film  never  shows  a  finished  product,  setting  the  tone for  the  workers'  feelings  of  futility.  The  combined  labor  of  the  mass  of relatively  unskilled  workers  keeps  the  machine  running.  The  group  of workers embodies the heart of the machine, because they keep it pumping. Meanwhile, the system devalues the individual skilled laborer and increases productivity. The workers themselves are like the disjointed pieces of the machine at the film's opening, isolated from the end result and from each other, toiling for a product to which they will never connect.

Whereas Metropolis paints  a  bleak  picture  of  industrial  society  with unhappy workers and blatant class divisions, Modern Times uses  humor to  make  a  similar  statement.  Influenced  by À nous la  Liberté ,  Chaplin's Modern  Times tells  of  a  faulty  factory  worker,  who  falls  behind  on  his assembly-  line  duties  after  encountering  a  series  of  distractions. 24   The comedy that ensues is pure humanity in its flubs and flaws; the film uses humor to show the ridiculousness of forcing a human to work as if he were a machine. The mechanistic labor highlights the inadequacies of humans, which comedy then highlights further through the particular absurdities of Chaplin's tramp. Chaplin composed much of the score for Modern Times himself, but as he did not possess the musical knowledge to compose a full score, he worked extensively with David Raksin (Lynn 1997, 383). 25  The music from Metropolis '  opening scene along with that of Modern Times ' assembly-  line scene illustrate how the mechanical aspects of the music imitate the machines shown on screen, often creating dissonance against the movements of their human operators.

The first  assembly-  line  scene  begins  with  playful  strings  and  twinkling upper woodwinds accompanied by the image of workers hammering away on the line. Chaplin turns screw after screw, but when he pauses briefly to scratch an itch, the line backs up and the music shifts into minor. Chaplin and his supervisor argue. 26  Chaplin gets back to work, only to have a bee, marked  aurally  by  a  series  of  ascending  triad  arpeggiations  in  the  flute shown in Example 1.6, fly around his head.

The president of the company comes over the speaker and pushes for more  speed  just  as  Chaplin  is  relieved  from  his  spot  on  the  line  (4:42). He  walks  away  to  the  same  music  that  played  earlier,  the  music  of  the assembly line. Even though he is not actively working on the line, his body still jerks through the motions of his labor, turning screws in the air as his legs awkwardly try to walk (5:06). Garrett Stewart (1976, 297) describes

Example 1.6 The distracting bee, Modern Times (transcribed by author)

<!-- image -->

these laboring aftershocks as symptoms of the 'internalization of mechanical rhythm' and writes that the rhythm 'attacks Charlie and pushes him over the edge early in Modern Times ; for him there is no stoppage of the machinery in his own nervous brain as he careens wildly about the factory in an involuntary hysteria of bolt-  tightening gestures long after he has been yanked from the conveyor belt.'  That  the  music  follows  Chaplin  rather than the machine reveals that while the music scores the machine in Modern Times , the 'machine' is not the monstrous mass of metal and screws, but rather the labor process-  Chaplin, and at times the other workers, repeating the same tasks mindlessly, mechanically, and monotonously.

Later in the film we see Chaplin working his afternoon shift. He quickly falls  behind  and  when  his  supervisor  yells  at  him,  the  strings  undulate through a five-  note chromatic sequence that gradually ascends by half step (14:13),  shown  in  Example  1.7.  When  his  supervisor  leaves,  the  strings begin constant arpeggiations over harp glissandi until he falls so far behind that the strings repeatedly glissando. Mallets mark the beat with repeated quarter notes, gradually ascending higher and higher as Chaplin loses control  (14:23).  Chaplin  climbs  onto  the  line  to  try  to  regain  his  place,  but instead he moves towards the mouth of the machine. His neighbor catches his feet, but with a loud cymbal crash Chaplin enters the chute at the end of the conveyor belt and winds through the gears (14:45). The music stops as the cymbal crash resounds. Chaplin is trapped in the gears, tightening stray bolts as he goes, while the woodwinds and glockenspiel bumble through an out-  of-  tune, o/ff-  kilter waltz. Chaplin's supervisor unwinds the machine and the music changes character again, moving through another ascending chromatic line as Chaplin untangles from the machine's innards and re-  enters the workroom with a piccolo trill and flourish (15:11).

The 'machine' music of Metropolis and Modern Times uses woodwinds and  percussion-  centered themes, constant driving rhythms, and  odd rhythmic accentuations to mark the mechanical aspects of the music. The prisoners sing the lilting melody of À nous la Liberté , on the other hand, as if to suggest that the human voices have become part of the assembly line and that the human laborers are the machine. Metropolis ' music maps directly onto images of the machine and the music conveys the mechanical within the context of a more traditional score. Rather than directly imitating the sounds of the machine, Metropolis ' score presents a mechanized musical version of those sounds-  music imagined as machine. The score

Example 1.7 Chromatic sequence, Strings, Modern Times (transcribed by author)

<!-- image -->

for  Chaplin's Modern  Times is  similar  to  that  of Metropolis :  the  music accompanying the assembly-  line scenes is distinctly mechanical, with quick, regular rhythms and woodwinds and percussion to highlight the machine's literal presence and its role in the action on screen.

All  three  scores  perform  mechanical sounds through a musical setting, using  music  that  sounds  like  or  imitates  the  machine.  The  di/fference between them lies  in  the  mechanism  that  each  score  imitates. À nous la Liberté imitates  the  machine  on  screen,  but  the  laboring  prisoners  metaphorically embody the machine. In Metropolis the mapping is more direct, as the screen clearly shows each machine that the music imitates; when the machine image changes, the music changes as well. However, in Modern Times , the music correlates more directly to Chaplin's movements-  which certainly clash with the mechanistic movements he should be carrying outrather than the movements of the machine. But if the assembly line, and the Taylorized breakdown of the labor process, turns a group of workers into a collective body of labor, wherein the most valuable laborers are those who blend best into their work, then the actual machine in Modern Times is the collective body of workers, much like in À nous la Liberté . Chaplin's 'individuality'-  his humanity -  makes it di/fficult for him to assimilate into this body, and the music illustrates his distractions and flaws as an assemblyline worker by accompanying the distracting bee or his itchy nose. In other words,  the  music  strays  from  the  musical  topic  of  the  mechanical  when Chaplin's attention strays from his work. Chaplin's incessant tightening of gears aligns with the incessant ringing of mallet and woodwind instruments in his score, a score for the human machine.

These film examples present three di/fferent versions of the mechanization of human labor. Metropolis presents the human laborers as mindless puppets,  and  its  music  demonstrates  the  clearest  example  of  the  musical topic of the mechanical. Modern Times acts  as  a  kind  of  bridge between Metropolis and À nous la Liberté in that it openly presents the struggle of a human trying to labor as a machine, and its music reflects that struggle between  the  musical  topic  of  the  mechanical  and  a  distracted  narration of  Chaplin's  wandering  attention.  And  finally,  in À nous la  Liberté ,  the prison laborers provide the soundtrack for their work, as if the mechanized labor has claimed the most human part of them, their voices. In suggesting that the human workers and their collective labor form part or all of the machine, Taylorized labor celebrates a kind of labor that absents humanity. Production takes precedence, labor is subhuman, and the ideal worker is a mindless, faceless body. In foregrounding the dangers of mechanized labor, whether through Modern Times '  comedic setting or the darker scenes of the factory and prison of Metropolis and À nous la Liberté , these films and their scores reflect machines' encroaching influence over labor during the Machine Age.

## Part 2: The Mechanical Novelty

In  addition  to  providing  musical  accompaniment  for  silent  films  in  early motion picture houses, the player piano (a blanket term I will use to refer to  various  models  of  self-  playing  mechanical  piano)  brought  mechanized music into saloons, theaters, and parlors. I use the player piano to exemplify my second category, music written to highlight the skills of virtuoso performers while also showcasing the machine, because it delivered physical evidence of a player's technique through the visual display put on by the piano's keys in a way the phonograph record and radio could not. 27  In addition, as David Suisman (2010, 13-  14) argues, at the turn of the century 'many more people saw the player-  piano as a revolutionary cultural force and the phonograph as a mere trifle than the other way around.' Player pianos could work longer hours and perform with fewer errors than a live musician, and paper piano rolls cost less than several hours' wages. The presence of ragtime in saloons at the turn of the century, in particular, helped smooth the transition from live pianist to player piano. Because most ragtime composers wrote specifically for the piano, the music especially suited the player piano and thus the instrument became a kind of showcase for the talents of ragtime composers. 28  In addition to ragtime's popular music sales, the reproducing piano's (a more sophisticated kind of player piano, meant to capture the interpretation of the player) of recording duplication of recorded performances by famous pianists and composers such as Claude Debussy, Sergei Rachmanino/ff (discussed specifically in Chapter 2), Ignace Jan Paderewski, and George Gershwin, created a market for the wealth to own and replay concert-  level performances in their own homes (Chanan 1999, 60). Rolls of ragtime music and famous performers took advantage of the player piano's mechanical performances, then, in a few ways: in selling music written specifically for player piano, in selling specific performances, and in showcasing the technical capabilities of the machine itself.

The  piano  roll  drew  attention  to  the  piece  and  more  importantly  to the (absent) pianist, the celebrity composer/  performer whose ghostly fingers tickled  the  ivories  from  coast  to  coast.  As  examples  of  popular  works written specifically for player piano, I focus on novelty rags, a primarily post-  First World War subsection of the ragtime genre involving triplets, syncopation, and parallel fourths (Banfield 2004, 98). 29  Several U.S. composers wrote works in the novelty rag genre, including Roy Bargy with Jim Jams (1922), shown in Example 1.8, which includes rhythmically and technically challenging interruptions, and Pianoflage (1922), a work that is a lengthy 126 measures (not including repeats!) of near nonstop syncopated quarter and eighth notes. George Linus Cobb's Snuggle-  Pup (1929) pairs a boomchuck left-  hand pattern (similar to the pattern shown in Jim Jams ) and a relatively simple melody for the genre. Finally, Zez Confrey was specifically known for his novelty rags, and his works like Kitten on the Keys and Poor

Example 1.8 Challenging rhythms and doublings in Bargy's Jim Jams

Example 1.9 Kitten on the Keys ,   T rio,  mm.  64-  70

<!-- image -->

Buttermilk epitomize the genre with an emphasis on speed and technique that usually proved too di/fficult for the amateur pianist. 30  His technically and rhythmically challenging novelty piano pieces appealed more broadly as piano rolls than as sheet music, and as such they exemplify a key kind of mechanical music.

The score for Kitten on the Keys conveys not only several complexities that  would  have  intimidated  many  amateur  pianists,  but  also  the  more 'mechanistic'  features  of  the  work.  The  piece  has  three  sections,  much like a traditional rag. Its trio section, the beginning of which is shown in Example 1.9, hammers at a relentless fortissimo with accents on almost every attack, including the blaring octaves in the left hand. The relentless accents bring  to  mind  the  staggered  accents  of Metropolis ,  wherein  the  constant accents cancel one another out. In Kitten on the Keys , as in Metropolis , the accents imply an indi/fference to metrical hierarchy and beat patterns in an

Example 1.10 articularly dif/ficult syncopation in P Kitten on the Keys ,   T rio,  mm.  95-  8

<!-- image -->

aggressive push towards randomness rather than musical coordination. The right hand takes advantage of the full keyboard, reaching G7 (circled in the example) multiple times. At several points the right hand must balance one syncopated rhythm in the top voice while the lower voice carries another syncopated rhythm, all while keeping track of the steady left-  hand chords and octaves that often require the left hand to hop between the low and middle ranges of the keyboard.

Example 1.10 shows one particularly di/fficult passage from the end of the trio, mm. 95-  8. Negotiating this combination of rhythmic complexity and large range demands a highly skilled pianist, who would likely still be challenged by the piece's Allegro moderato tempo. These factors increased demand for rolls and records of the piece, and more specifically for Confrey's performances of the piece on rolls and records. As David Thomas Roberts (2001) writes, 'The novelty style was influenced by piano-  roll arrangements, and  many  works  demanded  considerable  pianistic  skill;  indeed,  their composers were among the most adept pianists in the popular field.' In composing di/fficult works, Confrey essentially created a demand for more than sheet music-  Confrey sold his performance along with the piece.

Another Confrey novelty work, Poor Buttermilk , has a darker tone than Kitten on the Keys , and its B section is arguably the most rhythmically challenging passage of the novelty rag genre (Jasen and Tichenor 1978, 219). The section begins in B  minor with an eighth-  note chromatic descent in ♭ octaves  in  the  left  hand.  The  right  hand  enters  half  a  beat  too  late,  and the left hand pauses on beat two as if to allow the right hand to catch up. But the right hand breaks after two eighth notes as well; after every two eighth notes in each hand, an eighth rest appears, keeping the hands metrically  misaligned. The right hand comes in on the upbeat of beat one and follows the same two-  eighth, one-  eighth rest pattern a half beat behind the left  hand.  This  hypermetric  confusion  lasts  just  over  one  measure  before the left hand settles back into even quarter notes in m. 21, but the evenness only lasts for three measures before the right hand throws the rhythm o/ff again in m. 24 with a new syncopated pattern above an even pattern in the

Example 1.11 Hypermetric complexity in Poor Buttermilk ,  mm. 24-  7

Example 1.12 Melodic simpli/fication of m. 24, Poor Buttermilk

<!-- image -->

left hand, shown in a full score version in Example 1.11 and a simplified version in Example 1.12. The numbers above and below the score indicate the  blurred  hypermeter.  Both  syncopated  sections  repeat  before  an  endaccented introduction to the return of the A section.

These two pieces are just a sampling of Confrey's 90 novelty rags-  a figure that marks him as the 'most prolific and versatile writer of piano novelties' (Shaw 1987, 86). 31  The novelty rag became popular just as recording technology emerged, and recorded music then changed performance practice in the private sphere as well (Jasen and Tichenor 1978, 215). Indeed, from the

turn of the century to the mid-  1920s, sheet music sales slumped while player piano sales soared. 32  Rather than writing di/fficult music solely for stage performance, composers like Confrey wrote for piano rolls to showcase their own talents and capitalize on their skills as well; the machine allowed them to record and duplicate their performances as a new type of musical commodity. 33  Concurrently, while Confrey and others composed and consumers adjusted to music as issued from a machine, music became more accessible to more people through the popularity of records and rolls. The popular music market supplied a seemingly unending amount of catchy new tunes, and consumers came to desire the commodity; consuming the latest pop tune became 'the path to personal fulfillment' (Suisman 2009, 10).

Another performing commodity came in the form of celebrity rolls, of which  there  are  several  hundred  surviving  examples  (Philip  1998,  77). 34 More often than not, these rolls were for the expensive reproducing piano, and as Russell Sanjek (1988, 383) writes, 'it became the fashion to invite friends to home concerts by Paderewski, Debussy, Grieg, or Victor Herbert.' Regarding  the  rolls'  historical  value,  Ord-  Hume  (1970,  35)  writes,  'we may hear from a music-  roll the identical performance and interpretation of  a  pianist  long  since  dead.' 35 Many  artists  recorded  for  both  roll  and record,  and  the  di/fferences  between  similarly  timed  recordings  demonstrate the player piano's (and piano roll editor's) ultimate influence over the resulting musical commodity. For example, as discussed in Chapter 2, Sergei Rachmanino/ff made two recordings, one roll and one record, of his C-  sharp minor Prelude in 1919. 36 Claude Debussy recorded 14 pieces for the reproducing piano, but due to flaws in the Welte-  Mignon recording system in catching nuanced pianistic shifts of color, his rolls are not highly regarded as a record of his playing. It was odd that Debussy would have recorded on piano roll to begin with, as he was reportedly a pianist 'uninterested in velocity or cold clarity per se ' (Howat 1997, 102). 37

That  the  piano  rolls  presented  perfected  versions  of  some  artists' performances, as in the Rachmanino/ff work, or the de-  nuanced playing of performers who emphasized pianistic subtlety over technical virtuosity, as in Debussy's rolls, demonstrates that though these rolls were marketed as accurate  recreations  of  a  particular  celebrity's  playing,  they  were  instead mechanized  performances  influenced  by-  or  limited  by-  the  machines that played them. The mechanical virtuosity is di/fferent in kind from the musical  virtuosity  of  Rachmanino/ff's  playing  or  the  expressive  virtuosity of  Debussy's,  and  it  is  the  mechanical  virtuosity  that  the  player  piano forefronts: each roll showcased the machine as much as a particular artist's rendition. 38 Moreover,  the  roll  reproduced  mechanized  labor,  musical labor  reduced  to  data,  duplicated  by  a  team  of  workers  and  reproduced by machine. The machine does not, then, reproduce the virtuoso's highly skilled musical labor, but rather a concretized version of that labor, distilled, boiled down, and modified to suit the mechanism. The reproducing piano

and mechanical reproduction irrevocably redefine virtuosic performance as something that can be reproduced without the live, laboring presence of the virtuoso. 39 The reproducing piano, and the player piano, allegorically demonstrate the influence of Taylorized labor on musical practices, the e/ffects of which still impact the highly edited and technically perfect recordings of today's market.

Yet unlike the invisible labor hiding in a record's grooves or in the data of  an  MP3,  the  player  piano,  with  its  uncanny  visual  display,  could  not completely erase the visibility of the performer: the moving keys indexed the performer's absent body. 40  The invisible performer played on command; the  instrument  conjured  a  performing  specter,  a  servant  to  the  pianolist. Moreover,  the  live  presence  of  a  pianolist  at  the  bench,  operating  the instrument and adding musical interpretation to the roll, complicated the notion that the instrument issued a perfect mechanical reproduction of a highly  skilled  performer. 41   Taking  a  note  from  Taylor's  positive  spin  on deindividualization in the workplace, player piano manufacturers worked hard to convince consumers that they were listening to a piano played by real musicians; one Welte-  Mignon advertisement (Anon. 1911, 19) claims 'the interpretation is so faithful and characteristic that the artists who have performed for the Welte-  Mignon have endorsed each roll with their autograph.' The detachment of music from the laboring performer embodies Taylor's  philosophy  of  breaking  down  labor  into  small,  easily  managed pieces,  of  blurring  the  overall  production  process  in  the  fracturing  of  its steps  so  that  no  one  laborer  can  be  credited  with  a  particular  creation. At the same time, mechanical reproduction and the player piano foreground the wonders of Taylorized labor, helping to showcase the magic of machines by  taking  something  expressive,  musical  labor,  and  Taylorizing  it;  the musical machine is the spectacle and the pianist (excepting known and marketable virtuosos) joins the line of faceless workers. The resulting product is  the  work of the virtual company as a whole under the leadership of a few skilled and powerful individuals. Confrey's novelty rags and celebrity rolls exemplify mechanical performances that imitate human performances; the machine imitates the human as the player piano rolls store particular performances to be replayed across the country at the will of the consumer. À nous la Liberté , Metropolis and Modern Times , on the other hand, exemplify music that imitates machines, musical versions of mechanical sounds. In  each  case  the  machine  inspires  or  imitates  music,  and  while  the  films comment on the desubjectifying e/ffects of Taylorism, celebrity rolls exploit the new consumerist market.

## Part 3: The Mechanical Ballet

A caricature from 1927, shown in Figure 1.1, depicts a dressing-  gowned George Antheil sitting on a pillow with a bike pump and horn attached,

Figure 1.1 Antheil Caricature, 1927

<!-- image -->

hunched over a highly ornamented piano keyboard. His right foot appears to be inside the body of the piano and literal bells and whistles cover the piano itself (Lewis 2017). The top of the piano has a horn not unlike that of a 1920s phonograph with haphazardly drawn music notes spilling out. Kitchen utensils hang from the phonograph horn and the whistles on the side of the piano are bursting with steam from the engine inside the body of the instrument. This image contains layers of machines, from the simple fork to the more complex steam whistles and phonograph horn, and the bicycle pump and horn attached to his seat emphasize the excessiveness of the machines that surround Antheil. The caricature pokes fun at mechanical music, and therefore also Antheil by depicting him as a lazy, comfortable operator, overseeing the machine, touching it only slightly with the tips of his fingers while the machine does the rest of the work.

Despite the laziness the caricature suggests, 1927 was an exciting time for Antheil and his machines. In a 1925 letter to Stanley Hard, Antheil wrote of his most recent work, Ballet Mécanique : 'My first big work. … Scored for countless numbers of player pianos. All percussive. Like machines. All e/fficiency. NO LOVE' (quoted in Oja 2003, 81). Antheil, described in an issue of Der Querschnitt (Searchinger 1924, 47) as a 'young pianist composer

who had been creating riots all over Central Europe, and the most dangerous menace to present-  day compositions,' began work on the piece in Paris in 1923. 42  After its successful July 17, 1926 premiere in Paris, its first New York performance on April 10, 1927 was a disaster (Schmidt-  Pirro 2006, 407); correspondingly, the work would come to be known as both his  'zenith  and  his  nadir'  (Whitesitt  1983,  xviii).  Explaining  his  motivation behind the work, Antheil reportedly claimed, '[I] wanted to express American industry and American Architecture and found that I could not do that with conventional music, so I proceeded to develop new forms' (Schmidt-  Pirro 2006, 408). According to Antheil, the piece was to serve as a cautionary tale, 'to warn the age in which I was living of the simultaneous  beauty  and  danger  of  its  own  unconscious  mechanistic  philosophy, aesthetic' (Antheil 1945, 140). The term machine aesthetic became tied to Antheil, an aesthetic that, according to Linda Whitesitt (1983, 116), consists of 'motivically conceived melodies and propulsion to his chordal ostinato patterns within a dissonant, yet static, harmonic framework.' The work is a kind of distilled representation of the musical topic of the mechanical when, to convey the machine aesthetic musically, Antheil's original score includes parts  for  three  xylophones,  electric  bells,  three  propellers,  tam-  tam,  four drums, a siren, two pianos, and 16 pianolas (a particular brand of player piano) written in four parts (Antheil 2003).

The work's instrumentation and the mechanical basis of its sound puts it in a di/fferent category from the imitative mechanical music of Metropolis or Modern Times , and from the showy display of virtuosity put on by Confrey, Rachmanino/ff, and Debussy's rolls. In Antheil's work, human performers align  themselves  with  the  machines  as  they  play;  rather  than  using  the machines as an extension of the human performer, the human performers act as additions to the player pianos that relentlessly charge through the roll with an indi/fference innate to the machine. One of the reasons this work represents the musical topic of the mechanical is because Ballet Mécanique is an exercise in rhythmic relentlessness; Schmidt-  Pirro (2006, 409) claims that  the Ballet  Mécanique 's  'most  notable  characteristics  are  a  steady eighth-  note rhythm which seems to be interrupted only at the end of the piece by unusually long stretches of silence.' The work has, as it were, just two settings, completely on or completely o/ff. And yet despite a constant barrage of eighth notes, the impression the piece delivers is one of unpredictability: the infernal machine. Accents shift as the eighth-  note pulse of the first theme hammers away, burying the metrically irregular melody in the inner voice of pianolas I and II. Reduced to just the melody in Example 1.13, the theme is based on a six-  note pattern that constantly shifts just slightly, throwing o/ff any kind of strong metrical regularity.

The initial statement of X includes six eighth notes that span the tetrachord from A-  D. The final A holds across the bar line, indicated with the dash,  delaying  the  pattern's  attack  in  m.  2.  The  second  statement  of  the

Example 1.13 Ballet Mécanique ' s hidden melody

<!-- image -->

pattern gets cut short, interrupted by the third statement, which successfully repeats the pattern from m. 1, X. In mm. 4-  5 the variant (X') expands by one additional repeated pitch, C , which again blurs the metrical placement /uni266F of the pattern. The C  bumps the ½ X of m. 6 by half a beat so that it falls on /uni266F the same part of the measure as the ½ X statement in m. 2. The brief interlude in m. 7 sounds like a quick resetting, as if the machine has been thrown o/ff kilter with its half-  statements and additional pitches. Another statement of X follows the reset in m. 8. Measures 9-  10 appear to repeat the variant X' of mm. 4-  5 with repeated C s, but the final A gets cut o/ff by another /uni266F resetting interlude in m. 11. The machine catches on faster, resetting sooner. X appears without its final A one more time before the interlude material takes over with its wide-  ranging harmonized scales that sound like the wind of the propellers in the background.

The opening 12 measures alone illustrate how this music showcases the machines that play it. Behind the irregular patterns, the pianolas hammer dissonant harmonies of seven or eight notes per attack. The music, while not impossible for the human pianist, would be extremely taxing, demanding constant  and  regular forte eighth  notes  that  stretch  the  hand  to  up  to  a tenth. 43 Meanwhile  the  propellers  turn  in  the  background,  giving  the music  an  unfamiliar  whooshing  punctuated  by  the  occasional  drum  hit. The pianolas and each hand of the xylophone function as three separate machines that align rhythmically while evidently remaining indi/fferent to the harmonic dissonance between them. The player piano mirrors this mechanistic  indi/fference  to  harmonic  dissonance,  while  the  human  performer struggles against it. A steady, relentless rhythm-  essential to the industrial machines themselves-  acts as the most basic ingredient to the early 20thcentury machine aesthetic.

After the opening 12 measures, Ballet Mécanique continues to hammer through  dense  eighth-  note ostinati and  scalar patterns with  various

mechanistic melodic fragments moving between the voices. After a sweeping pianola transition  that  ushers  the  music  out  of  its  opening,  the  first  and second pianolas take the forefront again with eighth-  note triplets in m. 20, making  the  beat  seem  faster  and  more  frantic.  Rather  than  its  contrary motion musings of the opening, the xylophones instead hold a dissonant tremolo between E and F  in the upper part, and D, E, and F  in the lower. The /uni266F ♮ melody now moves through the di/fferent voices as if the ear is meant to trace the sound as it meanders through the innards of the machine. Occasionally the musical machine stops and starts, turning over like a faulty engine. For example, in mm. 50-  3, the pianolas come in awkwardly at the end of each measure with loud and dissonant mid-  range chords followed by low strikes at the bottom of the keyboard's range. Other than the occasional propeller whir or drum hit, the other voices drop out in m. 50, creating a marked change from the thick tremolos and accented harmonies of mm. 48-  9.

The electric bells ring often, slicing through the sonic texture, keeping audiences aware of the mechanistic nature of this music. The piece is meant for machines, and as such it avoids classification as tonal or atonal-  Antheil claims that his Ballet  Mécanique 'is  of  no  kind  of  tonality  at  all.  It  has nothing to do with tonality. It is made of time and sound … the two materials, FUNDAMENTAL materials, that music is made of …' 44  Yet Antheil's claim does not stop scholars from assigning various tonal and polytonal labels to the piece, for example when Keith Allan Cochrane explains that while the piece 'does not depend on the harmonic orientation of sections to determine its form. Still, some sections are heard in definite keys while others are written without clearly identifiable tonalities.' 45  Cochrane also explains the piece as in three main sections, while Schmidt-  Pirro disagrees, describing it  instead  as  'A  Gigantic AAAAAAA-  Form.' 46  Either is possible, though Cochrane's divisions are di/fficult to find in the score and even more di/fficult to hear-  while section divisions are readily apparent, it is di/fficult to say which divisions are more important and which less. AAAAAAA-  Form disregards  the  di/fferentiations  clearly  made  between  sections,  and  thus seems disconnected from what actually occurs in the music. If anything, a hybrid between Cochrane's and Schmidt-  Pirro's formal descriptions fits the piece best-  it follows something like an ABCDEF form, a form which has a trajectory but no underlying formal principle based on sectional recurrence.

Perhaps the most jarring moment in Ballet Mécanique comes at the very end when all voices drop out for a measure of complete silence. The machine turns o/ff for a few beats to create a shocking contrast against the cacophonous sounds of what came before in another manifestation of the musical topic of the mechanical. For example, in m. 1,222, the pianolas barrel back in  with  tremolos  as  the  siren  wails,  piercing  the  silence.  Next,  the  four pianolas' ostinati return with unwieldy metric shifts from 11/  16 to 10/  16, then two measures of 11/  16 before a measure of 8/  16 and 17/  16. The meter keeps changing as the pianolas' hammering 16th notes become tremolos,

covering  the  entire  range  of  the  keyboard  between  the  four  instruments, until finally the very last measure brings the drums and pianolas together for a final syncopated measure of 11/  8 to close the piece. The ending is a blur after the shocking measure of silence, and when its extreme forte noise settles into the syncopated final measure, the syncopations feel like a relief. There is no recapitulation or grand conclusion; the music stops as if with the flip of a switch. The piece ends with two eighth notes, the last marked with an accent as if to deliver the final indi/fferent punch to audiences' musical expectations. Antheil's machine aesthetic remains true to itself to the very end, maintaining awkward rhythms and indi/fferent melodic fragments for the length of the piece before quickly turning it o/ff as clearly as it began.

The untiring machine influenced musical practices in the early 20th century, as the sounds of the Machine Age spread beyond the factory walls into motion picture houses, parlors, and even concert halls. Antheil's Ballet Mécanique creates  an  unusual case: a machine music that belongs to the machine, with humans as a kind of sideline authority. The piece, while within the confines of the classical tradition, strove toward a new realm or dimension of musical expression by giving machines a music, as if they required an  expressive  outlet.  Antheil  then  went  beyond  anthropomorphization to  the  full subjectification of  the  machine  in  an  allegorical  musical  realization  of  Taylor's  principles.  As  machines  learned  the  now  simple  tasks carried out by human laborers, the machine subsumed the role of manual tools  and  replaced  them  with  their  mechanized  counterparts-  much  like how the player piano takes on the function of a human pianist in Antheil's Ballet . While  it  appears  as  though  the  piece-  the  machine-  absorbed the  conductors  and  performers,  it  in  fact  realized  what  Taylor's  system demanded. The piece allowed the performers and conductor to step to the side of the production process when the machine, as programmed by the roll, represented  an  appropriation  of  the  performer's  own  productive power. In so doing, Ballet Mécanique came closer to the ideal realization of  industrialized  labor,  a  labor  that  no  longer  required  humans. Ballet Mécanique ,  then,  makes  the  most  critical-  and  optimistic-  observation about the Machine Age and early 20th-  century labor practices. The danger inherent in an era that embraces rather than fears mechanical technology is the dissolution of the human laborer as a tool into the mechanism, that the defeated, desubjectivized laborer will then become the faceless puppet at work. Ballet Mécanique suggests the opposite when it takes the beatendown laborers, the musicians, and further mechanizes their labor, elevating the laborers to supervisory positions. The humans then become authority figures pulling the strings, controlling the mechanized machine, the laboring puppet of a fully realized industrial society.

The  1927  caricature  discussed  at  the  beginning  of  this  section  depicts Antheil  as  lazy  and  eccentric,  perhaps  predicting  the  future  of  Taylor's industrialized  labor  practices.  But  more  than  making  fun  of  Antheil,  the

caricature makes a crucial point about the industrialization and mechanization of musical labor: mechanized musical labor, much like mechanized production, is modern music, music in the age of post-  industrialization. The caricature  of  Antheil  and  his  machines  predicts  a  post-  industrial  society, a society based on laboring machines and the humans that control them. Antheil, then, was a kind of pre-  post-  industrialized musician, a musician before his time, predicting and modeling the future role of editors and AutoTune, roles that may not actually be so disconnected from those of the lost and greatest generations.

## Notes

- 1  This chapter is based on an article first published in Music Theory Online , April 24, 2018, www.mtosmt.org/  issues/  mto.18.24.4.wente.html.
- 2  Richard Guy Wilson (1986) defines the machine age as 'the dominance of the machine in all areas of American life and culture and the creation of that special sensibility informing modernism.' The New York Times Index used the term 'Machine Age' in 1927 (Trachtenberg 1986). See also Dinerstein (2003, 5).
- 3  In this chapter, I use the general title 'player piano' as a sort of catch-  all term for the various models of self-  playing pianos, including push-  up piano players, player pianos, and occasionally reproducing pianos. Push-  up piano players and many player pianos require a skilled musician to operate the various levers and knobs of the instrument in order to create a musical performance. When I write the pianist 'vacated the bench,' I do so with an awareness that this often meant the pianist's seat was then taken by a pianolist in order to make a musical performance. Reproducing pianos, much like the modern Disklavier, can recreate a performance that includes dynamics and tempo shifts. For more information on pianolists and the player piano, see the the Pianola Institute's page 'On Playing the Pianola' (www.pianola.org/  contacts/  contacts\_  playing.cfm); Lawson 'What is  a  Pianolist?';  McElhone  2004;  Ord-  Hume  1970;  Parakilas  1999;  Reblitz 1985; and Suisman 2010.
- 4  Music has always used machines, in the sense that instruments are machines. As Timothy D. Taylor (2007, 283) writes, 'The production and dissemination of  music  involves  a  wide  range  of  technological  artifacts:  violins,  pianos,  tin whistles,  radios,  CD  players,  mp3  players,  and  so  forth.  Each  of  these  technologies exists as a separate commodity -  yet inextricably intertwined with the musical commodities they contribute to producing. Ultimately, the commodity status  of  each  depends  on  the  other:  music  could  not  exist  as  a  commodity without the technologies involved with its making and transmission; nor would those technologies serve much purpose without the music they purvey.'
- 5  By  musical  topic,  I  mean  what  Robert  S.  Hatten  (2014,  514)  defines  as  'a familiar  style  type  with  easily  recognizable  musical  features ,  ranging  in  complexity from a simple figure (fanfare, horn call), to a texture (learned style as polyphonic  and/  or  imitative;  chorale  or  hymn  style  as  homophonic),  a  complete genre (various dance and march types; French overture), a style ( ombra , tempesta , Empfindsamkeit ),  or  some  overlap  of  these  categories.'  The  literature on musical topics is extensive and also includes Ratner 1980; Allanbrook

- 1983; Agawu 1991; Hatten 1994 and 2004; Caplin 2005; Monelle 2006; and McKay 2007.
- 6  Programmatic music would necessarily incorporate music that imitates machines, much like the machine sounds used in the orchestral, chamber, and opera examples that follow.
- 7  This example does not include parts for horns and percussion, all of which are silent during these measures.
- 8  Tamara  Balter  (2009,  126)  writes  of  the  'mechanical'  or  'automaton'  in Haydn's music, citing the music's 'mechanical elements, such as endless repetition, often with a gradual slowing down, as when a machine needs rewinding.' Balter cites the fifth movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in C-  sharp Minor , op. 131, as the typical model for the mechanical topic before analyzing Haydn's Rondo finale in the Quartet in B-  flat Major ,  op. 33, no. 4, for its mechanical gestures.
- 9  Standley Howell (1979, 987) writes that the movement was 'inspired by Maelzel's recently invented chronometer (forerunner of the metronome).' In her work on the Automaton topic in music, Balter (2009, 133) writes, 'Beethoven's interest in the musical depiction of the mechanical and its metaphorical extensions reached its peak during the last ten years of his life, especially in the scherzi of opp. 127, 131, and 135.'
- 10  Carolyn Abbate (1999, 487) writes about the shift from androids to music boxes, and notes, 'perhaps machine makers discarded the human facsimile because of the spectacle it presents: a body pinned or wired to a mechanical device.' Abbate (1999,  487-  8)  writes  that  by  '1797  the  requirement  for  a  human  form  was less keenly felt, and over the course of the nineteenth century, musical playermechanisms and music boxes began to drop their android ornaments.'
- 11  Wiggins  ba/ffled  audiences  of  his  time  because  he  was  disabled  and  African American. W. Womack Smith (2016, 1701) writes, 'Throughout his career, audience members and reviewers, bewildered by how a disabled African-  American could play with such beauty and precision, speculated he must be a fraud. It was suggested that his idiosyncratic behaviors, likely connected to an autism spectrum disorder, were choreographed to give the illusion of mental disability in order to inspire curiosity and promote ticket sales.'
- 12  Lawrence  Zbikowski  (2009,  367)  describes  the  right  hand's  16th  notes  as 'swirling,' and claims 'Schubert's accompaniment is, of course, meant to evoke the sound of the wheel in action, with the swirling sixteenth notes summoning the wheel itself and the repetitive, o/ff-  beat accents in the middle voice representing the clack of the bobbin.'
- 13 The Clock Store , a 1931 Disney cartoon, follows a similar narrative to the one in Orth's In the Clock Store , but uses music by Frank Churchill.
- 14  I  should  note  that  the  use  of  the  cuckoo  might  be  notable  to  some  readers, because it is one of the examples used by Raymond Monelle in The Sense of Music . Monelle (2000, 17) writes that if the orchestral imitation of the sound of a cuckoo ' inevitably signifies the heralding of spring , then this icon has been transformed into a topic.' If this is not clear, then the cuckoo would be what he calls a 'prototopic.'
- 15 Musical Courier specifically mentions Orth's In the Clock Store as being played 'by special request' in 1920, almost three decades after its composition. The

Courier praises  'Max  H.  Manne for the delightful e/ffects  which  aroused  the enthusiasm of the audiences' (Johnson 1920, 42).

- 6  Film  examples  are  not  the  only  possible  examples  of  music  written  to  sound 1 like or imitate the machine. Arthur Honegger's Pacific 231 (1923), with its imitation  of  a  steam  locomotive,  comes  to  mind  along  with  works  such  as  Leo Ornstein's Suicide in an Airplane (1913), Darius Milhaud's Machines Agricoles (1919),  Francis  Poulenc's Promenades (1921),  and  Alexander  Mosolov's The Iron Foundry (1927). For more information, see Morgan 1994.
- 7  Taylor (1911, 6-  7) also writes that eventually 'no great man can (with the old 1 system of personal management) hope to compete with a number of ordinary men who have been properly organized so as e/fficiently to cooperate.'
- 8  The snare hits and melodic snippets on flute sound militaristic rather than mech1 anical. Indeed, the military is a kind of human machine, working as one body for a common goal.
- 9  Lang  based  his  metropolis  on  New  York  City  and  as  Paul  Rotha  (1960, 1 275) writes, the film captures the city's 'rows of rectangular windows, its slowtreading workers, its great geometric buildings, its contrasted light and shade, its  massed  masses,  [and]  its  machinery.'  Peter  Larsen  (2005,  35)  claims  that the film was the most expensive German production of the silent era. Lang was a Viennese director for the German studio Ufa noted for his 'intelligence and breath' and gothic style (Hellmung-  Waldow 1928, 65).
- 0  As was often the case with silent film, Gottfried Huppertz's original score was 2 not used and the film was extensively recut when it was released for the American market (Paulus 2009, 102).
- 1  In his analysis of 2 Metropolis , Graeme Turner (1988, 173) writes that the mediating  character  in  the  film  fulfills  a  sort  of  Christ-  like  role;  he  is  'the  'heart' which guides the co-  operation between the 'head' (the ruler) and the 'hands' (the workers).' In addition, Turner writes about the political undertones of the film, which Hitler apparently admired for its Fascist leanings.
- 2  The music for the 2 Metropolis examples in this chapter is based on Thea von Harbou's theater manuscript (piano reduction) of Huppertz's score.
- 3  The original version of 2 Metropolis was lost shortly after its 1927 Berlin premiere. When I write of the alignment between score and film, I refer to the 2004 restored  version  released  on  DVD.  Also  note  that  in  2008,  an  additional  25 minutes of footage was found in the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires (Rohter 2010). For more information on the destruction and reassembly of Metropolis , see Minden and Lachmann 2000, 117-  22.
- 4  Pauline Kael (1991, 1) writes that ' 2 À nous la Liberté was obviously the source of some of the ideas in Chaplin's 1936 Modern Times ; the producing company filed suit against Chaplin for copyright infringement, but Clair had the suit dropped, saying that 'All of us flow' from Chaplin and 'I am honored if he was inspired by my film.'  '  Mark  Lynn  Anderson (1999), in his introductory address to a 1999  screening  of À  nous  la  Liberté ,  mentioned  the  similarities  between  the two films as well, stating, 'Even more important was the influence À nous la Liberté on Chaplin's 1936 film, Modern Times , especially on that film's famous assembly line  sequences. Modern Times copied  ideas  and  scenes  from  Clair's film so closely that Tobis, the German firm which produced À nous through its Paris branch, sued Chaplin for breach of copyright. Clair, however, refused to

participate in the suit, acknowledging that he had based much of his own work on Chaplin's earlier screen performances; he was delighted and very flattered that Chaplin would return the compliment. As a result of Clair's non-  participation, the suit against Chaplin was dropped.' In Charlie Chaplin and His Times , Kenneth Schuyler Lynn (1997, 372) writes that there was a 'well-  founded suspicion that [Chaplin] had lifted his basic ideas for the picture's assembly-  line scenes from René Clair's satire of the machine age, À nous la Liberté (1931).'

- 25  As Lynn (1997, 383) describes, 'Chaplin would show up at the studio in midmorning, armed with a couple of musical phrases he had thought of for the sequence at hand. Raksin would duly write them down. Then they would run the footage over and over and discuss how the music might relate to it. Sometimes they decided to go with Chaplin's melody. On other occasions they would modify it, or one of them would invent a new melody. Some of the phrases they began with were extensive, while others consisted of only a handful of notes. Again and again, Chaplin would whistle the tune, or hum it, or pick it out on the piano as they developed and varied it in accordance with the action on the screen. The work was hard.' Raksin gives a full account of his experience of working with Chaplin in Life With Charlie (Raksin 2010, 69-  81).
- 26  Even though Chaplin's Modern Times was  made  in  1936,  several  years  after the advent of sound film, Chaplin's tramp character does not speak at all in the film. Instead, the tramp sings a nonsense song, Je cherche après Titine , because Chaplin believed if the tramp were to speak 'the first word he ever uttered would transform him into another person.' See Chaplin (1964, 366). In Film, A Sound Art , Michel Chion (2003, 22-  4) writes of the significance of the Tramp's song.
- 27  Compositions that use previously recorded music would fall into my third category, music written out of and for machines.
- 28  Berlin (2013) describes the basic genre of ragtime as 'a style of popular music that  flourished  from  the  mid-  1890s  to  1918.  Its  main  identifying  trait  is  its ragged-  i.e.,  syncopated-  rhythm.'  In  their  history  of  ragtime,  Jasen  and Tichenor (1978, 1) describe ragtime as a 'musical composition for the piano comprising  three  or  four  sections  containing  sixteen  measures  each  which combines a syncopated melody accompanied by an even, steady duple rhythm.' Ragtime played an important role in the history of American popular music, especially between the mid-  1890s and the First World War, but its popularity is somewhat of a contradiction. Other popular sheet music of the time catered to the amateur pianist, but ragtime's complex rhythms usually demanded more of the pianist.
- 29  The novelty rag, described as a 'series of complicated workouts for virtuoso pianists,' is a successor to ragtime (Yanow 2001, 3) .
- 30  Confrey studied music at the Chicago Musical College and then, along with his brother, performed in a touring orchestra beginning around 1915 (Tucker 2001). While scholars credit Felix Arndt with the composition of the first novelty rag in 1915, Confrey brought the style into the limelight in 1921 with his Kitten on the Keys and Poor Buttermilk , among others. Felix Arndt was a New York-  based composer who wrote Nola for  his  fiancée  Nola  Locke.  He  made  up  to  three thousand piano rolls for companies such as QRS and Duo-  Art before his tragic death (Shaw 1987, 86).

- 1  Shaw notes that one of Confrey's unpublished pieces, 3 Twaify's Piano , was based on the noises made by a piano in Twaify's store in LaSalle, Illinois: 'Confrey was able to imitate the out-  of-  tune keyboard, flapping piano roll, and the wheezes. It was this composition that led to his making piano rolls for QRS and Victor.'
- 2  Responding to music's changing domestic role, in 1933 Edward B. Marks (Shaw 3 1987, 13) writes, 'Most pernicious of all was the e/ffect of the new ether toy upon pianos. Home playing practically ceased.'
- 3  David  Suisman  (2009,  10)  writes,  'Consumers  assimilated  the  idea  of  music 3 as issuing from an automatic machine (such as a phonograph or player-  piano), detached from human labor, and fixed in objects (such as records or piano rolls), portable and storable, and independent of time and place. Music, which had once been produced in the home, by hand, was now something to be purchased, like a newspaper or ready-  to-  wear dress.'
- 4  Most  celebrity  rolls  were  made  for  the  Welte-  Mignon,  Duo-  Art  or  Ampico 3 companies.
- 5  Ord-  Hume (1970, 35) continues, 'admittedly, some of these artists made phono3 graph recordings, but these are inferior on many counts. … [The player-  piano] was certainly regarded as of greater interpretational significance than the gramophone by some famous pianists.' Ord-  Hume also credits the player piano for the 'increased musical knowledge amongst people who might otherwise never have had their latent musical interest aroused.'
- 6  For a detailed discussion and analysis of these two recordings, see Wente (2016). 3
- 7  Recording  for  the  Welte-  Mignon  system  was  more  black  and  white  than  for 3 other systems. The Welte-  Mignon system recorded pedal up or down (no halfpedaling), with either a steady dynamic or dramatic shifts in dynamics (no slight increases or decreases), and also responded better to a firm, decisive touch, rather than to variances in key velocity (the instrument struggled to bring out particular voices in parts and chords).
- 8  Of course, the mere mention of virtuosity brings to mind Franz Liszt and the 3 changes  that  occurred  in  performance  practice  during  the  19th  century.  An extensive discussion of virtuosity and the machine is a huge topic beyond the scope of this chapter, but for more information see Walker (1985).
- 9  Arved Ashby (2010, 60) explores the idea of storing and repeating a perform3 ance  and  the  e/ffects  of  that  on  the  listener,  noting  'by  the  late  1800s,  then, people were able for the first time in history to hear the very same sequence of sounds not only once, but twice, four, seven, ten, a theoretically unlimited number of times.'
- 0  Most models of player piano require some sort of live, present operator, whether 4 skilled (a pianolist) or unskilled. The reproducing piano could play without an operator. For more information, see fn 2.
- 1  This  displacement  of  the  skilled  performer,  or  the  idea  of  the  pianolist  as  a 4 kind of placeholder for the virtuoso, is a kind of stepping stone between performance as  something  that requires a  live  performer  to  live  performance  as one of the modes through which we listen to music. This time captures a key shift that eventually leads to a change in audiences' expectations of performers. Some present-  day performance groups worry about what John Pippen (2014, 139) discusses as 'showing too much.' Writing about Eighth Blackbird, Pippen

explains, '  'showing too much' is an expression of modernist sociocultural values in which the performer's body risks distracting audiences from the musical work. In a culture focused on the appraisal of stable musical works, musicians' moving bodies risk destabilizing the alleged timelessness of pieces by foregrounding the nuances of a specific performance' (139).

## Unveiling the Editor's Hand

A Sonic Comparison of Rachmaninoff's C  Minor Prelude /uni266F on Roll and Record

## Introduction

Mechanical reproduction transformed the ways people accessed music in the early 20th century. Instead of relying upon the household amateur, local musician, or concert-  hall professional, mechanical instruments, phonograph, and radio made the latest tunes available at a moment's notice. But capturing and storing music in a consumable format required a reconceptualization of what a performance was, and which elements of it  were  expendable.  In this chapter I compare reproduced performances as they di/ffer on rolls and records. Instead of looking at mechanical music through a broad historical lens, or culturally through several examples from the same time, this chapter compares performances as captured by di/fferent recording media. I compare recordings of the same work played by the same pianist in the same year but using two di/fferent recording media: reproducing piano roll and phonograph record. I speak of recording technology as a kind of memory-  storage device, and I tease out some of the di/fferences between the data stored on roll  and  record.  I  use  sonic  visualization  software  to  compare  the  sound wave files and draw conclusions regarding the storing and replaying of data in  each  device.  In  comparing  the  mechanical  player  piano  with  its  main competitor, the phonograph, I explore the development of recorded music as  something  fundamentally  di/fferent  from  the  development  of  recorded sound. Both the reproducing piano roll and the phonograph record store a particular version of music, but as my analysis will show, the kinds of data captured and stored in each technology is very di/fferent. Looking closely at two contemporaneous recordings creates a unique vantage point for exploration into the theoretical di/fferences between early 20th-  century recording media and what they store.

In  recounting  the  history  and  development  of  sound  reproduction, scholars tend to emphasize the phonograph rather than the player piano, an  attitude  which  David  Suisman  captures  when  he  describes  scholarly treatment of the player piano as nothing more than a 'historical also-  ran, a postscript to the age of the piano, a foil to the more dramatic advent of the

phonograph' (2010, 13). But the player piano in fact dominated the new musical marketplace, with its popularity peaking as late as the early 1920s and with some 2.5 million player pianos sold between 1900 and 1930 (OrdHume 1970, 34). So why is it that scholarly research so often glosses over or completely ignores the player piano when presenting the history of recorded sound? For starters, by 1930 the record's quality had improved so much that the phonograph all but took over the music reproduction scene, competing with radio rather than the player piano. Furthermore, the phonograph could record instruments other than the piano, and its familiar round disc evolves throughout the first half of the century, only losing popularity with the advent of 8-  track and cassette recordings. Music enthusiasts still play records to this day; records are consistently in vogue. The same cannot be said for the bulky player piano, which fell completely out of the mainstream for nearly half a century, only to re-  emerge in the late 1980s through Yamaha's Disklavier line and through MIDI technology.

Perhaps due to the advent of MIDI and this renewed interest in self-  playing pianos, researchers have become more aware of the historical importance of the player piano. But while scholars like Suisman, Mark Katz, Timothy D.  Taylor,  Arved  Ashby,  and  others  acknowledge  the  player  piano's  significant role in sound-  recording history, little work has been done in theorizing how these two technologies di/ffer in storing and recreating sound. Theorizing  the  di/fferences  between  the  storing  and  recreating  of  musical sound through record or roll presents a set of distinct challenges because the two technologies function di/fferently, and perhaps even represent two di/fferent, albeit related, media.

## Prelude: The Player Piano Mechanism, the Pianolist, and the Rolls

The player piano is a kind of elaborate music box, with a rotating barrel that feeds perforated paper rolls across a tracker bar marked with a series of holes. The player piano could labor tirelessly in parlors and businesses because it automates the role of the pianist, capturing the active human labor involved in playing the instrument and transforming it into a series of mechanically reproducible actions. To recreate the actions of a pianist, the instrument automates parts of the traditional or 'silent' piano-  the pressing of a key, which causes the hammer to strike the string, the use of foot pedals to lengthen or soften the hammer strikes, and the force with which the hammer strikes the strings (for varying articulation, dynamics, and phrasing). 1

While the player piano is a relatively simple machine compared with the computers of today, the machinery itself can get quite complicated. My overview of the mechanics of the instrument is a simplification based on Arthur W.J.G. Ord-  Hume's lengthy discussion of how the player piano works. As Ord-  Hume  explains  it,  'the  player-  piano  is  a  machine  containing  a  partial vacuum into which air is continually trying to find access. In entering

the instrument, it is made to perform a mechanical function' (Ord-  Hume 1970, 143). The tracker bar connects by channel to a pressurized chamber, which maintains a vacuum when the operator's feet pump the piano's foot pedals. When a hole in the paper roll aligns with a hole in the tracker bar, air passes from the chamber to release a valve that corresponds to a particular key on the piano. For a player piano to access all 88 keys, there must be 88 small mechanisms (which are staggered to allow them all to fit) (OrdHume 1970, 150). The player piano's pneumatic action corrects many of the imperfections found in a music box or early phonograph-  it does not slow down or stop randomly because it does not require winding up, rather just  someone  to  pump  its  pedals  and  regulate  the  pressurized  chamber. 2 The musicality of the resulting performance, of course, depends upon the skills and musicianship of the instrument's operator-  a skilled musician will likely produce a more aurally pleasing result than an amateur.

The most conspicuous aspect of the player piano is its absent player, its invisible entertainer. 3 Yet most early player pianos required a live pianolist, a musician skilled in manipulating the knobs and pedals on the player piano. As discussed in Chapter 3, marketers urged people to learn to play the player piano instead of the traditional 'silent' piano, as they claimed the process involved markedly less skill. Manufacturers were keen on commercializing leisure time, and the idea of a perfect in-  home performance without substantial practice appealed to consumers. People were given instructions and some even took lessons in playing the machine; the number of player piano teachers and how-  to guides increased exponentially (Taylor 2007, 287).

But  for  all  of  the  assertions  made  for  'perfection  without  practice,' playing the player piano was not simple. While the pianolist does not literally  press  the  keys  of  the  piano  as  a  pianist  would,  the  pianolist's  job requires a large number of subtle shifts that are akin to those of the pianists' fingers on the keyboard or feet on the pedals. Concert pianolist Rex Lawson explains that the pianolists must use their feet to control the dynamic force of the player piano's mechanical fingers as they strike the keys. The pianolist, he says, must

acquire a subtle and fluent use of the tempo lever; and his left hand must carry out the functions of sustaining and una corda, which his feet are too preoccupied to manage … Unthoughtful pedaling will produce unthoughtful music, devoid of light and shade and without the slightest signs of life.

(Lawson 1986, 286)

Lawson adds,

Just as an experienced driver is able to cope with left and right hand drive, with manual and automatic gearboxes, with indicator and windscreen  wiper  controls  on  di/ffering  sides  of  the  steering  wheel,  so  a

pianolist learns to control tempo, dynamics and pedals in a variety of ways.

(What is a Pianolist?)

Although  a  well-  trained  and  musical  pianolist  could  create  realistic  and high-  quality performances from a player piano and most player pianos were built to produce musical performances, Lawson claims 'most performers lacked  the  musical  understanding  to  use  such  an  easily  acquired  digital technique. As a result, the mistaken impression was created that the player piano had its own unique sound, characterized by inexorable tempi and terrace  dynamics  with  only  one  terrace'  (Lawson  1986,  286).  Although Lawson lists the characteristics he believes to be undesirable in a musical performance, the inexorable tempi and flat dynamics of a bad pianola performance are exactly what drew some composers to the instrument-  these are the 'mechanical' sounds that lend the player piano its unique classification as something other than the traditional 'silent' piano, played by a live musician. Rather than the mechanical labor required for piano playing, the player piano required a managerial labor, more akin to checking the gauges of a machine. The at-  home performing musician transitioned from a highly skilled laborer to a moderately skilled manager.

Though the deskilling of musical labor sounds like a negative side e/ffect of mechanical instruments, this deskilling helped bring much more music to people's homes. The Aeolian Company went so far as to compare the invention of the player piano to the printing press, writing,

Just as the printing press opened the world of knowledge and literature and through to all men instead of to the few, so the Pianola opens the world of music, of emotion, and of self-  expression to all instead of merely to the few with talented fingers.

(The Aeolian Company 1915)

It  required little  substantial investment of skill and did not take years to learn,  but  people  were  still  involved  in  their  own  entertainment  to  some extent-  they  controlled  the  foot  pump  or  hand  crank,  they  adjusted  the tempo and volume knobs. The main di/fference between a player piano performance and that of a live pianist is in the former's predetermined outcome.  Recorded  music-  whether  for  player  piano,  reproducing  piano, phonograph record, or even MP3-  is locked into a particular performance, while the human musician can follow or ignore the instructions in the score (Suisman 2009, 93).

There were three primary methods of production for regular player piano rolls. These methods reveal the di/fferent ideologies behind musical production and recordings in the early 20th century. 4  The first two methods of producing piano rolls involved a live pianist. In one method, the piano keys

were hooked up to 88 carbon markers that pressed down with the keys of the piano. Some companies maintained a small group of sta/ff pianists to play pieces onto rolls (Suisman 2009, 148). After the performance, arrangers and editors would manually punch holes into the roll corresponding to the pencil markings  (Montgomery,  Tichenor,  and  Hasse  1985,  94).  Through  rollpunching machinery, many rolls could then be made from one master roll.

In  the  second  method,  the  piano  keys  hooked  up  directly  to  a  special piano that punched holes into a master roll as the pianist played. These two methods of making rolls from a live  performance  developed  during the 1910s, when 'the public was eager to hear more lifelike 'solo' performance' (Montgomery, Tichenor, and Hasse 1985, 94). After the roll was first punched, editors and arrangers fixed mistakes by taping over holes made by wrong notes and re-  punching corrected holes, and added octave doublings for  emphasis  (Montgomery,  Tichenor,  and  Hasse  1985,  94).  While  both of  these  methods  involve  a  live  pianist,  the  ultimate  result  also  involved editing and arranging after the  initial  take-  an option not available with early phonograph recordings. 5

The  third  method  of  punching  rolls  is  the  earliest  and  also  the  most interesting in terms of the way it e/ffaces or even erases the marks of a particular performer. As Michael Montgomery, Jay Tichenor Trebor, and John Edward Hasse write, 'the earliest piano rolls were not true recordings of someone's actual playing' (Montgomery, Tichenor, and Hasse 1985, 93). The arranger knew precisely how many inches of paper corresponded to a particular number of measures of music and would measure and cut rolls essentially  by  eye,  dividing  the  sheet  into  perforations  for  various  notes to  produce  a  master  roll  (Montgomery,  Tichenor,  and  Hasse  1985,  93). Arrangers loosely referred to the score, and they often added di/fficult virtuosic embellishments and octave doublings (Durkin 1999, 175). Sometimes arrangers  enhanced  celebrity  piano  rolls  as  well.  For  example,  rolls  supposedly made by Gershwin or Mahler, when transcribed, require a two-  piano arrangement in order to make the work playable live. Andrew Durkin writes, 'In addition to making 'real' piano playing sound 'better' (by getting rid of the 'mistakes' in a player roll), the most skilled piano roll editor/  arranger could make an entirely 'artificial' performance (that is, one created entirely by the editor/  arranger) sound 'real'  ' (Durkin 1999, 175). Durkin concludes that  though  a  finished  roll  was  most  often  marketed  as  'handplayed,'  it actually  resulted  from  multiple  hands-  the  pianist's,  the  editor's,  and  the arranger's  (Durkin  1999,  176).  This  final  method  of  roll  production  was the predominant method through the 1910s and, as discussed in Chapter 4, its performer-  less roll punching may have indirectly inspired the straight-  toroll compositions that appealed to composers like Igor Stravinsky or Conlon Nancarrow (Montgomery, Tichenor, and Hasse 1985, 94).

Editing  and  arranging  after  the  fact  erases  flaws  and  enhances  the performer's  playing,  which  are  advantages  that  appealed  to  performers.

Although roll editors rarely highly edited the original playing, any error in the strip or cylinder was easily detectable by the human ear (Phillips 2016, 140). According to Alexander Buchner,

each job had to be calculated at least  to  a  fiftieth  of  a  second.  This meant that the pins on the cylinders or the holes in the rolls had to be placed exactly to half a millimeter. The e/ffect of atmospheric conditions on the exact parts of the mechanism, or the result of long use, led to tiny changes which noticeably a/ffected the performance.

(Buchner 1959, 37-  8)

Overly  perfecting  a  roll,  however,  led  to  performances  that  were  too mechanically  exact-  a  human  musician's  performance  would  include variations  in  timing  and  volume  that  may  not  be  written  on  the  score (Timis and Willenbrink 1996). Piano roll editors and arrangers-  much like the music editors working with digital music today-  balanced this issue  through  processes  very  similar  to  modern-  day  quantization  and humanization. 6

Quantization is the process of making a performance adhere to the regularity  of  the  metrical  structure.  Editors  of  rolls  routinely  recut  imprecise musical  performances  so  that  they  more  meticulously  accorded  with  the rhythms of the musical score (Phillips 2016). Unfortunately, quantization can lead to overly exact rhythms that sound machine-  like and unnatural. Humanization is a process that undoes the mechanical precision of quantization, usually by adding a measure of randomness that places notes slightly o/ff the strict metrical grid or by reincorporating performance nuances such as accelerandi or rubati . Often, the quantization and humanization processes involved doctoring the rolls to such an extent that resulting sounds became impossible for an artist to re-  perform.

Despite editing beyond what the artist can re-  perform, rolls were often marketed as the authentic reproduction of a particular pianist or composer, and advertisements made claims such as 'The Welte Artistic Player-  Piano … Gives the Absolutely True Reproduction of the Individual Play of the World's Most Famous Pianists,' the Duo-  Art 'brings the playing of the most gifted  pianists  of  all  time  into  the  home-  their  performances  reproduced with the naturalness of which only the Duo-  Art is capable,' and the Ampico o/ffers 'Perfect Recording plus Perfect Re-  enactment ' (Roehl 2009, 47, 50, 58). As discussed in Chapter 3, George Gershwin, Claude Debussy, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Sergei Rachmanino/ff, Edvard Grieg, and many other notable performers' and composers' performances were marketed on rolls that would have been recorded in a way similar to one of these methods. These first two methods often involved spotlighting the performer, showcasing his or her skills as a virtuoso performer or composer, subtly perfected so that the playing might still be believable.

Ideally, the reproducing piano roll would have been recorded from the famous pianist playing onto the roll, but this was oftentimes not the case. For example, pianolist Rex Lawson claims Gershwin and Stravinsky's rolls are not recorded performances but handmade transcriptions (Lawson 2006, 357).  Nonetheless,  Suisman  writes  that  the  reproducing  piano  is  'most often remembered for having recorded, as nothing else at the time could, piano performances by many of the era's leading composers and pianists … but these much-  prized rolls were exceptional' (Suisman 2009, 148). Indeed, reproducing pianos, which were meant to accurately reproduce the style and interpretation of a particular performance in addition to the correct notes, were markedly more expensive and never made up more than 12 percent of the player piano market (Suisman 2010, 17).

Embellished  rolls,  such  as  those  discussed  in  Chapter  5,  by  contrast, involved taking the playing of a lesser-  known pianist and enhancing it so that the playing of the machine itself was on display-  the machine became a kind of virtuosic performer. Indeed, in some cases companies publicized that certain recordings were improved because of the editing. Phillips writes, 'Early publicity material [for Aeolian] suggests that pianists did most of the actual editing, although it is more likely that pianists advised editors.' Phillips continues, explaining that added octave notes to Horowitz's recording of the Carmen variations were most likely added by an editor 'without deference to  Horowitz.'  And  'the  apparent  alterations  to  Paderewski's  recordings are a further example of editing beyond simple tidying up a performance' (Phillips 2016, 167).

## Editing Records and Rolls

As  recording  technologies,  the  player  piano  and  phonograph  shared  a goal: to make a musical performance accessible long after its final chord fades. In capturing and storing a musical performance, the piano roll and phonograph record function as a kind of external memory device, holding a performance to be replayed again at a later time. The player piano and phonograph thus store memory in objects; they make memories external and tangible, and they transform performances from something impermanent to something that can be played back mechanically. But the performance preserved in records and rolls is not the same as an individual's recollection of a performance. Rather, the recording technologies capture a particular version of a performance, a version uninfluenced by previous experience or present perception and thus separate from the remembering or perceiving human body. As memory devices, recording technologies become external prostheses through which humans store memories in static form.

Machines  lack  the  ability  to  discern.  For  example,  a  phonograph recording takes in all of the sounds of a given performance, every cough and sneeze. The player piano roll initially marks every note and then goes

through a lengthy editing process during which editors manually discern for the machine; this manual process acts as a kind of humanization of a given roll. Despite the fact that mistakes are edited out, the editor's choices regarding pitch doubling, lengthening the melodic tones, and pedaling and dynamics  all  add  elements  of  human  discernment  to  the  roll,  in  a  sense imbuing it with a fabricated consciousness.

## Editing Records

Editing is the key to the theoretical rationalization and di/fferentiation of early phonograph records and piano rolls-  piano rolls could be and were edited to perfection; phonograph records, captured all at once, often required several takes from the performer and even then a 'perfect' take was impossible. Indeed, writing about the phonograph, David L. Morton, Jr. says,

From today's perspective, the toughest part of recording was probably the fact that a song or performance had to be 'perfect' the first time. It was not possible to edit the recording in any way. Nor was it possible to record part of a recording first and 'mix' in a second part later.

(2004, 59)

The  recording  process  for  phonograph  was  not  well  documented,  and manuals or articles regarding the process are di/fficult, if not impossible, to find. Katz details the process based on the few surviving accounts, and he writes,

it is clear that the recording studio of the early twentieth century was not a congenial venue for making music. The room was usually cramped and hot, with the musicians playing for an audience of engineers and, before the advent of the microphone in 1925, a large acoustic recording horn (or many such devices-  sometimes up to a dozen horns were used in a recording session).

(2012, 23-  4)

Engineers and recordists closely monitored performers' volume, as one tooloud note could cause the need to jump from its groove, and dynamics softer than mezzoforte were often di/fficult for the recording to pick up. A given recording had to fall within two and four minutes in order to fit on the disc, and a given piece or movement had to be played in one continuous take. Editors did not splice recordings together until methods switched to magnetic tape in the late 1940s. Recording sessions required strict scheduling and complete silence before and after takes, and 'demanded an extremely low tolerance for error' (Taylor, Katz and Grajeda 2012, 25).

A  September  1910  article  titled  'How  Talking  Machine  Orchestras Operate,'  published  in  the  monthly  magazine The  Violinist ,  details  the recording  process  for  an  orchestral  musician  recording  for  phonograph. 7 The article writes of a 16-  piece orchestra of 'first-  class musicians, receiving higher salaries than obtain in most of the great philharmonic orchestras,' and who maintain steady work year-  round. Though the lead-  in makes it seem as if these musicians have glamorous jobs compared with their liveorchestra colleagues, the article then describes the way the musicians are required to position themselves around the recording device, 'perched on stools of varying height, some quite near to the ground and others stuck aloft on little platforms' ( The Violinist 1910, 38). They were arranged as such because each instrument projects at a di/fferent volume level-  once a recording was made it could not be edited, but moving and arranging the performers' bodies allowed for a kind of pre-  editing process.

The  article  follows  this  sample  orchestra  through  a  recording  session, where 'everybody is  warned  not  to  whisper  during  the  recording.'  Not long into the recording, the conductor cuts the musicians o/ff, claiming that a violinist attacked a note too soon. The author writes,

The fault was so slight that not one person in even a well-  trained audience of a thousand would have noticed it, but these tiny mistakes come out magnified many times in the record. No concert or operatic performance is ever as perfect as a Victor record must be. Musicians are allowed on the stage an occasional infinitesimal error, but no matter how small it may be it would fairly shout from the talking-  machine. It demands absolute perfection, and even the best of singers fail occasionally. Some fail frequently.

(1910, 38)

If mistakes are caught quickly, then they are not expensive to remedy; however, once the record has been made, fixing an issue becomes very expensive. Conductors and recordists were known to be quite ruthless in taking and retaking, cutting o/ff performances for the slightest error in playing or the slightest noise in the studio.

In 1916 singer Yvonne de Treville described her experience recording for phonograph:

I stipulated for an appointment at three and arrived promptly and gaily, thinking that the ordeal would be over in an hour's time. To tell the truth, I had promised to take a cup of tea with some friends at half past four, but it was nearer seven when I gulped down that stale beverage, between the hurried narrative of my experience.

(Taylor, Katz, and Grajeda 2012, 87)

She also describes the way musicians were arranged, seated in odd positions and odd places in the studio. De Treville claims that when the recording light did not turn o/ff immediately after the first take, she exclaimed, 'Why, if I had known there was more space on the cylinder I would have trilled longer,' resulting in horrified expressions on the faces of those around her. When they played the recording back, her exclamation came through at the  end  and  the  recording  had  to  be  redone  (Taylor,  Katz,  and  Grajeda 2012, 87).

Speaking from the conductor's perspective, Edwin MacArthur describes the recording experience as grueling. MacArthur writes,

Things can go wrong in any musical activity, of course-  a missed cue, a wrong note, a momentary stray from pitch. In the concert hall these may occasion a passing twinge, but in recording, on the other hand, one is haunted always by the thought that the slightest slip-  up will not only echo in the immediate listener's memory but will achieve actual physical immortality.

(Taylor, Katz, and Grajeda 2012, 92)

But  MacArthur  champions  recordings  and  argues  against  criticisms  that recorded performances are often too slow compared with live renditions, claiming  that  this  e/ffect  results  from  the  recording's  lack  of  distracting visuals. He also goes on to claim that performances often sound better on disc than in live performance, and he praises the technology for its ability to elevate even the most famous performers to new levels of achievement (Taylor,  Katz,  and  Grajeda  2012,  93).  And  indeed,  despite  such  onerous conditions,  many  famous  performers  and  composers  chose  to  record  for phonograph,  and  as  phonograph  recording  technology  improved,  more of the burden for perfection shifted from the performer to the editor. As the record's editors gain more and more control over the post-  production 'fixing' of a given recording, the recording process becomes more like that of the player piano.

## Editing Rolls

The recording and editing processes for the record could not be more di/fferent from that of the piano roll, which often went through multiple rounds of editing before finally gaining approval for mass production. According to an article in the November 1927 issue of Scientific American covering the reproducing piano roll recording process, pictured in Figure 2.1, when the pianist sits  down  and  plays  the  instrument,  the  mechanism  takes  notes,  literally with a pencil, of the keys the pianist presses, along with tone coloring and dynamics. These separate data sets then go through a development process, which takes measurements of the markings, and then the measurements are

transferred to a note sheet that indicates 'to an unbelievable accuracy' the loudness of each note (422). Thus, as the artist plays into the mechanism, it breaks the performance down into separate data sets, which then become figures  of  measurement based, apparently, upon the discernment levels of the average human ear.

The Scientific American article then describes the painstaking editing process, shown in Figure 2.2, as something apparently carried out by women, through which the performance is put. First, a woman checks the pencil marks made by the mechanism against the score in order to eliminate and correct any wrong notes. Other women measure and examine the dots and lines  taken  during  the  recording,  translating  them  into  perforations  on  a roll.  Editors extend perforations connected to melodic tones so they sing out above the accompaniment, and then workers add dynamics to the roll based on the markings, hand-  perforating pilot holes to guide the automatic

stencil-  making  machine.  The  automatic  stencil-  making  machine  cuts  the first playable roll of the performance, but the editors still have not finished. An operator who is also a 'finished musician' examines the trial roll, reediting and checking earlier fixes while indicating new corrections. After the finished musician completes her edits and the roll is changed accordingly, 'the record is an exact duplicate of the artist's playing, even in the smallest detail of light and shade, and is now ready for the artist to hear.'

The Scientific American article details the recording process for the reproducing player piano roll, which is one of the more advanced models of player piano and is the kind of roll I will use in my later analysis. Yet there are several kinds of player piano and many used simpler roll-  punching techniques such as hand-  punching rolls based on measurements and the musical score, or having a lesser-  known or unknown pianist play in a piece to get the notes on the roll and then editing that performance to perfection. Early versions of the instrument involved push-  up machines with mechanical fingers that played the keys of a traditional piano, but it was just before the turn of the 20th century that the instrument started to gain popularity, when American engineer Edwin Scott Votey patented a version of the German Welte player piano and called it the pianola. At this point in the player piano's development, the mechanism was inside the piano itself; built-  in additional levers and  pedals  controlled  tempo  and  dynamics  and  the  player  piano's  operator  could  shift  them  to  incorporate  tempo  changes  and  dynamic  shifts into  their  performance.  Eventually,  the  entire  player  piano  would  switch from  foot-  treadle  power  to  electricity,  which  allowed  the  instrument  to self-  regulate its performance and create something even more true to a live pianist.  As  the  mechanism  improves  the  irregular  performances  of  early player piano models, with their oddly mechanistic rhythms and simplistic

dynamic changes, there is a transition into performances on the reproducing piano, the piano that purportedly recorded artists such as Claude Debussy, Sergei Rachmanino/ff, Artur Rubinstein, Ignace Jan Paderewski, and George Gershwin (Chanan 1999, 73). The amount of labor required to make a reproducing piano drove up its price, and as such, these pianos were usually owned only by the wealthy. The price of the reproducing rolls, on the other hand,  remained  relatively  low,  which  encouraged  businesses  and  schools of music also to invest in reproducing models. Indeed, reproducing pianos were often marketed as teaching pianos, and manufacturers claimed that these pianos in particular could help teach artistry, in addition to technique (Roehl 2009, 49).

Arthur W.J.G. Ord-  Hume describes the reproducing piano as

simply a player-  piano wherein the last vestiges of human control are mechanically  performed.  It  is  an  instrument  which  may  be  switched on and left to play a roll of music, with the self-  same certainty of the resulting interpretation as we have today [1970] when we switch on a record player.

(1970, 193)

The record players of the 1970s are di/fferent from the models contemporary with the reproducing piano in the 1910s and 1920s; due to issues like poor fidelity of record players of the time, the reproducing piano roll and early records would not produce similar performances.

The  three  common  kinds  of  reproducing  piano  are  Aeolian  Duo-  Art, Ampico, and Welte-  Mignon. The Rachmanino/ff roll I will discuss later is an Ampico roll, created for the American Piano Company. Ampico's system used seven degrees of loudness, controlled by side perforations in the roll. In addition, the system included a mechanism to achieve crescendo and diminuendo e/ffects, along with defined accents on single pitches (Ord-  Hume 1970, 203-  4). Ampico's recording process involved two separate sheets of paper that recorded all movements of the piano's keys and pedals, along with precise  measurements of hammer speed as it hit the instrument's strings. To track hammer speeds, the recording mechanism used something called the 'spark chronograph technique, firing one spark through the sheet of paper as the piano hammer approached the string, and a second spark in the final instant of travel before it struck the string' (Ord-  Hume 1970, 98). Skilled engineers then combined the data sets from the two sheets of paper, much in the way described by Scientific American .

In sum, recording a piano roll involves decomposing and recomposing a performance. Editors analyze and break down data taken in during the playing, and then the recording passes from hand to hand, getting more and more polished as it moves through the process. The phonograph's uneditable format  meant  that  responsibility  for  the  perfectly  executed  performance

on a recording fell solely on the performer's shoulders, as recordists and technicians saw to the microphones and bells, not to fixing and editing away missed notes.

## Modernizing Musical Labor

While time is an important ingredient in both kinds of recording, the phonograph, with its uneditable and unchangeable span of musical time, places a heavier weight on one particular time span, while the player piano leaves the span of a particular performance open to editing and perfecting. Suisman distinguishes  these  as  'sound-  in-  time'  versus  'sound-  in-  knowledge.'  He claims that the phonograph conveys sound-  in-  time, 'that is, sound as the ephemeral vibrations in the air produced by a specific instance of musical labor (or other sound-  making activity)' (2010, 24). The player piano, on the other hand, represents sound-  in-  knowledge, 'that is, information and instructions on how to make music. It inscribed and conveyed how to perform, over and over, the labor required to produce certain predetermined sounds'  (2010,  24).  Suisman's  abstract  terms  provide  labels  for  the equally abstract concepts underlying the process of recording for phonograph or player piano. The phonograph captures sound waves, the player piano instructions for labor. In other words, the player piano recreates the movements that result in a performance, the skilled knowledge behind the actions  that  then  create  the  sounds;  the  phonograph  recreates  the  sound waves a performance emits, the vibrations that occur over a particular span of time. The player piano recreates cause, the phonograph e/ffect.

Suisman's abstract terms also form a conceptual link between concrete musical device, phonograph or player piano, and the kind of data stored, analog or digital. As shown in Figure 2.3, the player piano roll stores soundin-  knowledge as digital data. The roll animates the set of instructions programmed by the  performer  and  editors  in  order  to  recreate  a  particular sequence of steps, a set of laboring actions. The phonograph stores soundin-  time as a particular set of sound waves created within a set span of time through the labor of a specific body or set of bodies. The phonograph does not recreate the original performance's musical labor, it recreates the e/ffects of that labor. The player piano, however, does recreate musical labor, but it does so without the presence of a laboring human body. Thus, the main di/fference  between  the  two  technologies  lies  in  the  kind  of  action  stored in the device, or how each approaches the labor behind a musical performance:  the  player  piano  mechanizes  the  movements  that  create  sound, while  the  phonograph  absorbs  an  imprint  of  sound  waves,  storing  them amid the crackles and pops of a record's grooves. It is a di/fference of reanimation of movement versus time-  the player piano reanimates the physical movements  that  lead  to  a  performance;  the  phonograph  replays  stored

Figure 2.3 Charting Suisman's terms

sounds in time rather than creating them once again (Suisman 2012, 93). Carolyn Abbate asserts,

this distinction is not trivial. Phonographic recordings capture sound's impact on air and membrane, so if they suggest a body or body part, it is a fictional listener and his or her ear, someone sitting in a specific space and hearing a live performer, who is re-  created within the real listener hearing the recording.

$$(1999, 497)$$

The phonograph, then, records from an observational standpoint, as if the recording bell is a mechanized listening ear. The player piano, on the other hand, takes in the physical movements of the performer on the instrument; the piano absorbs the imprint of the performer's movements and recreates them from its own standpoint. The piano roll recording process breathes life into the instrument-  the process animates the inanimate by bestowing upon the piano the previously human role of performer. In obtaining the human role of performer, the player piano essentially replaces a human laborer; the machine takes on attributes of the performer and eventually replaces him or her. 8

In recreating labor without the human laborer, the player piano becomes a kind of musical allegory for early 20th-  century labor practices. As shown in Figure 2.3, the mechanization of labor into a series of tasks to be completed by relatively unskilled laborers sounds very much like a large-  scale version of what the player piano does in transforming and reproducing the labor of one skilled body, the performing musician, into a commodity, the roll, mass produced by less-  skilled workers. Moreover, in Frederick Winslow Taylor's

standardization of mass production, discussed in detail in Chapter 1, the workers' labors combine to form a closed system of movements in a particular order. These combined e/fforts create a final product; the workers' e/fforts over time create the whole action, just like the perforated holes in the roll, in time, recreate the sequence of actions that make up a particular performance.

According to Alan McKinlay and James Wilson, Taylorism and Fordism are symptoms of an

'e/fficiency' movement in which … machine technology was the guiding metaphor  of  the  e/fficiency  craze,  an  image  redolent  of  a  sense  that personal competence entailed subordination to an engineered hierarchy under  professional  leadership.  Taylorism  was  not  simply  a  technical solution specific to work organization but was a cultural innovation. The machine metaphor was enormously broad, and deeply ambiguous, at once conveying a dehumanizing logic while also suggesting a bountiful meritocracy.

(2012, 46-  7)

Mass production was the preferred method of production in factories by 1913-  14, lasted throughout the war, and was still very much the norm for factories during the 1920s, the Machine Age proper. In making the workplace more e/fficient, societal labor ideals shifted toward a system prizing e/fficiency and productivity, a system that rewarded workers for their ability to assume a place in the line and to increase production so that companies could sell  more  goods  or  services  and  thus  make  more  money.  It  makes sense, then, that the emphasis on e/fficiency, product standardization, and perfection in the workplace would filter into early 20th-  century musical culture.  The  player  piano,  with  its  standardized  rolls,  musically  exemplifies these cultural emphases.

Mechanization practices influence labor in music; shifts in labor practices carried into the music of the time both in composition and performance practice. Taylor's theory of scientific management relates to the player piano as a labor-  saving device that allows the 'deskilling' of musical labor. Much like factory work of the time, the player piano is not completely automated. It does require markedly less skill (and somewhat di/fferent skills) and has a higher tolerance for errors by its player (pianolist) than does a regular piano.

In  a  factory  organized  according  to  scientific  management,  the  human body continues to labor despite significant displacements by machines, but the factory requires a di/fferent kind of work-  regulated, operational labor. The labor process essentially bifurcates into manual and intellectual, and most laborers fall  into  one  category  or  the  other.  Manual  workers  complete such mindless tasks as tightening nuts and bolts, whereas intellectual laborers monitor machines and manual laborers. The labor required of a

pianolist is akin to this intellectual, managerial labor, as the pianolist oversees the machine as it completes the manual task of playing the instrument. As Taylor's labor practices reorganize factories and the system of production, the sounds of the machine saturate all kinds of music, from the rolls playing at the local saloon to film scores and concert halls.

In a fully realized industrial society, machines replace human labor. In the case of the player piano, the machine takes over as a kind of reification of labor memory, a mechanized version of something once belonging to  human consciousness.  As  a  machine,  the  player  piano  stores  memory in static form in order to replay it; it converts a series of actions made by the  human  laborer  into  data  stored  as  a  code  that  the  device  reads  and carries  out.  Though  the  phonograph record also stores memory in static form, it bypasses the labor and jumps to the resulting product. The phonograph does not recreate the process of making music; it only recreates the aural e/ffects of that process as if from the perspective of the listening ear, not the laboring body. Because of this di/fference, the phonograph captures not action but experience. The phonograph takes something ephemeral and makes it concrete; it takes a segment of time and freezes it, storing it in the record as if it could be recreated exactly as it was recorded. The hypothetical thinking behind the record, then, is to allow the listener to stand in for the  microphone, rather than the microphone standing in for the listener. The idea that it is possible to capture and store a particular span of time, a particular sense or experience, is perhaps what has fascinated scholars much more than the concretization of labor action found in the player piano roll.

Jonathan Crary deals with similar issues in Techniques of the Observer , wherein he argues that the first half of the 19th century gives rise to a new kind  of  observer,  a  modernized  observer.  Crary  paraphrases  Karl  Marx, saying,  'modernization  is  a  process  by  which  capitalism  uproots  and makes mobile that which is grounded, clears away or obliterates that which impedes circulation, and makes exchangeable what is singular' (1992, 10). Like Crary's modern observer, the player piano and phonograph give rise to the modern listener, a listener used to hearing certain aspects of a performance from certain mechanical devices. Like a kind of sonic zoom, each technology filters and amplifies a performance by taking and storing certain aspects while discarding others. For example, neither the player piano nor phonograph reproduces the visual spectacle of the performer's laboring body over the keys. The phonograph provides only the aural portion of a performance, while the player piano roll's dancing keys indexically signify the movements of the performer's laboring hands and simultaneously draw attention to the empty bench, to the negative space where the performer's body should be.

The player piano's moving keys indicate another di/fference between the player  piano  roll  and  phonograph  record:  the  di/fference  in  the  way  the inscribed  information  on  the  roll  or  record  interacts  with  the  machine.

While  both  instruments  inscribe  musical  data,  one  in  carved  grooves  on vinyl, the other in punched holes on a sheet of paper, the two technologies age very di/fferently. Through repeated playings, the phonograph record's grooves change: each pass of the needle buries the engraved musical sounds deeper into the record, further veiling it with crackles and pops that form the sonic equivalent to gray hairs and laugh lines. The phonograph record's aging process seems organic compared with the player piano roll, which may become brittle or damaged over time and no longer play. If well stored, player piano rolls have an indefinite lifespan; the piano roll can play as long as its paper holds up. But through repeated playings and handlings paper will begin to yellow and tear, and small tears may distort the piano's performance. These distortions are di/fferent in kind from the way time and use veils the phonograph record. The phonograph record's sounds recede deeper into its grooves, as if the record swallows its own content. The player piano roll ages less gracefully, as rips in the paper eventually render the roll unplayable.

Suisman summarizes the di/fference in aging styles of these two kinds of recording as a historical one. The phonograph record allows one to listen not only to the past, but also

the passage of time. … A vinyl LP record that has been played a hundred times sounds di/fferent-  with its pops, clicks, and surface noisethan one whose historical journey has been shorter or less momentous. The stylus is like a plow in the furrows of the past, churning up sounds long since buried.

(2010, 15)

The  player  piano's  marking  features  are  inherent  in  the  instrument,  not the roll-  its pedals and overly regulated rhythms, along with the 'honkytonk' and slightly out-  of-  tune sound, are features one might associate with a  saloon  piano.  The  binary  data  inscribed  on  the  roll  can  show  signs  of age, but these indicate mechanical flaws as opposed to serving as quaint reminders of an earlier technology. The roll does not lose its history, but rather it fails to record its own history in the way that the phonograph's auditory signals indicate its age. The roll's history lies in its playing, as a history of playing a recording on a specific device at a particular time. The phonograph record, on the other hand, continuously exhibits signs of its historical travels. The record's scratches, wear and tear, and loss of fidelity indicate how often it has been played; these marks reveal the record's use. The unique and ambient sounds veil each playing behind a layer of time; it is impossible to play a record without also hearing the history of that particular record.

Beyond the record and roll, both technologies are at the mercy of the machines that play them, and over time new models of the phonograph

replace the old as records evolve from 78 rpms to 33 1 /  rpm LPs and 45 3 rpm singles.  Meanwhile,  the  Great  Depression  put  an  end  to  the  player piano (and threatened the record industry), as people tuned in their radios to hear the latest music. The reproducing piano was the furthest the player piano developed until its resurgence in the 1950s, when it reappeared as a kind of quaint technology, something to amuse newly a/ffluent post-  war Americans.  The  paper  roll  has  no  part  in  the  Yamaha  Disklavier,  which operates on MIDI data, and comparing the reproducing piano of the 1910s with the Disklavier is like comparing Edison's phonograph record to the modern  MP3.  Eventually,  most  player  pianos  and  phonographs  themselves fall into disrepair, rendering the roll and record completely obsolete but for the museum showroom and collector's living room. The ambient sounds associated with the player piano-  the noise of the pumping pedals, the shu/ffling paper, and the whooshing of air through the pneumatic mechanism-  often  go  along  with  sounds  that  indicate  additional  mechanical issues, such as an overly bright or tinny timbre, or a constantly out-  of-  tune instrument. The latter sounds have come to be associated with the sound of the player piano. Indeed, modern audiences would likely be ba/ffled by the noise of the player piano's pedals, shu/ffling paper, and pneumatic mechanism. To modern audiences, the player piano's recognizable features are inextricably bound to the sounds of its heyday-  the Tin Pan Alley, barroom honky-  tonk,  and  slightly  out-  of-  tune  strains  of  sonic  depictions  of  early 20th-  century society, most often seen in films and television shows. In other words, modern audiences identify with particular sonic markers of 20thcentury society that, while perhaps not always accurate, reflect sound as portrayed in television and film through systems based more explicitly on the phonograph's recording history. The speaker systems of television and film connect directly back to the phonograph's horn, and these speakers portray their early digital counterpart, the player piano, in a quaintly inferior manner: out of tune, awkward, and mechanical.

## Rachmaninoff

In order to see how the data stored di/ffers between player piano and phonograph,  I  conducted  a  sonic  analysis  comparing  two  recordings,  one  roll, one record, of Rachmanino/ff's C Minor Prelude /uni266F made by Rachmanino/ff in 1919. 9  I found that the closing of the B section with its cascading triplets most clearly illustrates the theoretical di/fferences between the two recording technologies and the philosophical distinctions between the way each technology stores a performance. As the score in Example 2.1 shows, the hands break each triplet between them, and the accents that mark each new triplet switch hands with each successive beat, beginning in the right hand on beat three then darting into the left hand for beat four, only to immediately shift back to the right by the downbeat of the next measure. Marked fortissimo ,

Example 2.1 Rachmaninoff's C  Minor Prelude /uni266F ,  mm. 34-  44

<!-- image -->

the hands descend through the triplet pattern to the piano's middle range. The shift in register brings the pianist's hands to the center of the body, thereby allowing the full weight of the player's arms to drop onto the keys from above to violently strike the repeated vii° 7 -  i progression. Most players interpret the passage with an unwritten accelerando , often beginning at very fast speeds and ending in a cacophonous, pounding blur when the crescendo peaks and  the triplet oscillation stalls on a four-  octave sforzandofortississimo hit on A , as part of iv 6 ♭ .

In Rachmanino/ff's 1919 Edison Diamond Disc recording of the Prelude, these frantic triplets blur the beat so much that they are impossible to hear distinctly in time; the crescendo and unmarked accelerando create an e/ffect of  spinning  out  of  control  that  translates  into  the  pianist's  near  loss  of metrical  control  as  his  hands  push  aggressively  through  the  triplets.  The momentum builds as the pianists' hands expand and contract, pushing out away from the center of his body for vii° 7  and contracting back in for tonic

in a laboring display akin to the performer's breath-  a breath that is noticeably absent when the record plays. In Rachmanino/ff's Ampico reproducing piano roll, made for the American Piano Company, the triplets are easier to track, the beats clearer, each articulation placed just so, creating an e/ffect of controlled chaos.

In order to confirm this di/fference, a di/fference of a literal loss of control in the phonograph record and a staged re-  enactment of a loss of control in the piano roll, I analyzed each recording using Sonic Visualizer, a program designed to aid scholars in visual representations of audio data. Both recordings used for my analysis are MP3 files, which creates an additional, unavoidable layer of mediation. Figures 2.4 and 2.5 show the full sound wave file of each recording, marked with measure lines.

Initially, I slowed the B section of the 1919 phonograph recording in order to accurately place bar lines onto the sound wave. I found that slowing the playback to -  250 percent allowed me to keep count without losing the line in  the  distorted  sound.  I  was  all  but  completely  unable  to  keep  track  of the triplets without this feature. I assumed the same would be true for the piano roll, and it was-  to a point. When I slowed the same section of the 1919 piano roll recording, I noticed that the sound between the two was quite di/fferent, and not only because of the poor sound quality of the 1919 phonograph recording. The triplets  were  markedly  easier  to  count  in  the recording of the piano roll, and I needed to slow the recording much less (-  160  percent)  in  order  to  track  the  beats  and  accurately  mark  bar  lines. The  piano  roll's  impossible  evenness  unwittingly  disclosed  its  mechanical origin. 10

Rachmanino/ff  made  these  two  recordings  in  the  same  year,  and  while we would obviously not expect  them  to  be  exactly  the  same,  we  would expect certain similarities in interpretation. Yet, the piano roll editors' normalization and regulation of the ragged triplets of the B section establishes an underlying order to the apparent chaos, or measure to the unmeasured. In so doing, the player piano roll strips the section of its untamed nature, of the illusion that the roll performance can function as a memory image. The collapse of the B section on the piano roll, then, is not a collapse but a staged rendition, necessarily di/fferent in kind from the live performance. The distinction between the B sections on these two recordings is subtle, and yet it makes all the di/fference in how they function as storage devices that document the interpretations of an expert. While this comparison requires a slowed-  down analytical hearing, the normalization of the B section in the player piano roll makes for a much cleaner rendition than the phonograph record.  The  additional  auditory  layers  of  crackles  and  snaps  inherent  in the phonograph record perhaps have a more direct influence on a regular hearing, but the player piano's normalization of the B section carries through into a playing that is technically cleaner than the phonograph record, and that technical clarity adds an element of showmanship or false virtuosity to a supposedly authentic performance. Or, to turn that argument around, by retaining an element of showmanship in its performance, the player piano version is actually more like a live performance than the phonograph's aural rendition. Even though the extra virtuosic element comes from the editor's hand rather than the pianist's, it adds an additional layer of meaning to the player piano version that the phonograph's does not have. In manufacturing artistry, the player piano perhaps creates something more true to the original.

In my comparison of the recordings, I used the sound software to look at several factors-  dynamics, tempo, tempo peaks, and beats per minute-  to look for any other salient di/fferences between the two. Yet, as previously discussed,  the  smoothed  triplets  of  the  B  section  revealed  the  di/fferences between the recordings on a slowed-  down, analytical level. But there are more  obvious  di/fferences  between  the  two  recordings,  di/fferences  that sound clearly  without  the  need  of  any  additional  analytic  software.  The background noise of the Edison record veils the sound of the piano, creating a layered sonic barrier through which the listening ear must pass in order to get to the musical content. What's more, the background noise of the phonograph changes slightly throughout the recording; it is not a harsh white noise, but a soft series of crackles that ebb and flow with the rotation of the record. The crackling in time with the record's rotation can be jarring when the tempo of the piece does not align with the speed of rotation, and in this case the two tempi never align. This odd beat-  behind-  the-  beat adds an audible presence of the present in the phonograph recording-  the crackles are metrically regular to the mechanism but irregular with respect to the

musical content, creating a kind of meta-  metric dissonance. This is not to say such dissonances never occur in player piano performances. Indeed, it is quite the opposite as the pumping pedals and whooshing pneumatic mechanism of many common player pianos would create metric dissonances akin to the phonograph's spinning record. It is unlikely that such issues would materialize with the reproducing piano; barring the occasional shu/ffling of paper,  the  reproducing  piano's  mechanism  runs  relatively  quietly,  with  a smooth whirr of a modern machine rather than the crackling beat of the phonograph's needle. The phonograph makes its mechanism known aurally by nestling the recording behind the etched veils of previous playings, and the player piano's mechanism aurally emerges through advanced sonic analysis,  through  a  slowed-  down  and  therefore  unrealistic  hearing  of  a performance. Thus, the reproducing piano's invisible player inadvertently reveals  the  instrument's  mechanism,  while  the  phonograph's  mechanism comes through visually and aurally, with the irregular beating of the needle and groove.

## Conclusion

Even perfect performances falter under the figurative sonic microscope. The piano roll normalizes and regulates the ragged triplets of the B section of Rachmanino/ff's C Minor Prelude /uni266F , bringing measure to the unmeasured and creating a kind of staged rendition of the work, rather than a live performance. The end of the B section in the phonograph recording sounds more out of control because it is more out of control-  editors were not waiting in the wings to erase and re-  punch any irregularities. The subtle distinction between the  B  sections  on  these  two  recordings  makes  all  the  di/fference in how they function as storage devices for a musical performance. As a reification of action, the player piano roll stores a kind of idealized version of Rachmanino/ff's performance. As a reification of experience, the phonograph record presents a particular version of Rachmanino/ff's rendition as taken in from a fixed point and made static in the record's grooves. The reproducing piano maintains an element of the laboring body, absenting it but for a trace trapped in its uncanny keys. But the phonograph completely loses sight of that laboring body, erasing a crucial component behind the phonograph's sounds. Rachmanino/ff made these two recordings in the same year, and yet the resulting recordings are quite di/fferent in how they present his playing and in how they store sound. The crackling phonograph nestles a realistic capturing of his playing behind the auditory veilings of time, but the player piano roll's perfected perforations refine Rachmanino/ff's playing into  its  idealized  form  and  stage  a  kind  of  dramatic  re-  enactment.  In  so doing, the player piano maintains an element of Rachmanino/ff's presence with  its  visual  connection  to  his  laboring  body,  while  the  phonograph completely erases his body, storing only the impression of the sounds of

his  performance  on  the  recording  microphone.  Despite  its  editing  and perfecting, the player piano provides a presence the phonograph never can. Its animated keys mark the presence of an absence, nostalgically nodding to the performer, remembering him through rose-  colored glasses.

## Notes

- 1  Please note that the overview of the player piano mechanism in this section is generalized and that there are numerous variations to the system. The development of just the pneumatic device took place over several decades and led to multiple models. Moreover, there are several di/fferences between models depending on from when they date, from which country, and at which price point.
- 2  For more information on the mechanics of the player piano, see Ord-  Hume's Chapter 7: 'How the Player Piano Works' (1970, 141-  74).
- 3  Auslander (1999, 116-  17) suggests that the player piano is a first-  order simulacrum,  'a  device  that  counterfeits  a  human  performance  but  clearly  is  not human.' In this, it is more tied to humanity than the phonograph record, which is second order.
- 4  Production  of  the  rolls  made  specifically  for  the  reproducing  piano,  a  more expensive model of player piano that controlled not only the keys but dynamics, tempo, and expression, is detailed more thoroughly in Chapter 2.
- 5  The third method, discussed later in more detail, is the only method that creates rolls without the playing of a live pianist.
- 6  Quantization and humanization are modern-  day terms that I am borrowing to help explain the editing processes of rolls.

- 8  For more on this, see the discussion of labor in Chapter 1.
- 9  In  his  article  on  'mechanical  fidelity,'  Nick  Seaver  gives  an  account  of  the Ampico roll of Rachmanino/ff's C Minor Prelude /uni266F , which played in the window of  the  American Piano Company's (AMPICO) New York storefront in 1927. According  to  Seaver,  'mechanical  fidelity'  is  'a  rhetoric  of  faithful  repetition  that  was  built  in  laboratories,  treating  the  predictable  materiality  of  the reenacting  apparatus  and  the  piano's  'action,'  or  internal  machinery,  as  both symbols and guarantors of objective reproduction.' (Seaver 2011).
- 10  Oddly enough, when I took measurements of the space between bar lines in each example to figure out an exact amount for measure-  length variance, the two recordings came up with very similar results. Example 3 shows the B section of the sound wave for each recording; the vertical lines mark the measures and the spaces between which I took measurements. Both recordings had a di/fference of +  / - .2 centimeters at the most-  a surprising result considering the di/fference in the level of di/fficulty when it came to marking the bar lines onto the wave.

## Phantom Fingers at Work

Selling Mechanized Musical Labor in a Changing Musical Marketplace 1

## Introduction

Traditionally,  musical  instruments  are  inextricably  bound  to  the  bodies that play them: a piano needs a pianist's nimble fingers to press the keys; a  flute  needs  the  embouchure  of  a  flutist's  lips.  But  what  happens  when developments in mechanical technologies lead to the advancement of selfplaying  instruments  such  as  the  player  piano?  Such  devices  purport  to decouple the performing body from the musical instrument, separating the active labor of the performing body-  the pianist as he or she plays the instrument-  from a performance as recreated by way of the traces registered on a piano roll. Whereas the phonograph record reproduces an aural imprint of a particular sonic event as if from the perspective of a listening ear, a piano  roll  captures  and  stores  the  labor  behind  a  performance  from  the piano's vantage point, inscribing it in order to recreate that labor by way of its own workings (Sterne 2003, 22). 2  What is more the player piano makes present at least one half of the performer-  instrument duo: the 'liveness' of the piano's sound is unmasked by a record's pops and crackles, and is often enhanced by the presence of a live operator, or 'pianolist' (Auslander 2008, 116-  17). 3  Companies claimed these pianos played themselves, that owners could simply pump the pedals or press a switch in order to hear a perfect  musical  performance. 4   Such  flawless  performances  thus  became  a marketable  commodity,  lifting  the  burden  placed  on  domestic  musicians and diminishing the role of the amateur pianist. Yet the role of these commodified performances risks being conflated with larger narratives about the emergence of reproduced and recorded sound. In reality, the player piano played a specific role within that emergence, a role that cut across issues of labor, gender, education, and mechanical reproduction.

This chapter discusses di/fferent advertising approaches to the player piano and other mechanical instruments as demonstrated by print advertisements in American magazines and newspapers. 5  For clarity, the general title 'player piano' serves as a catch-  all term for the instruments discussed, which include push-  up piano players, player pianos, and reproducing pianos. Almost all of

the advertisements date from the player piano's heyday, beginning in roughly 1900 and culminating with the stock market crash of 1929. 6  I organize the advertisements  into  four  categories,  based  on  the  primary  representation of labor in each. The first category, perfect labor, highlights advertisements that appeal to people by way of the machine-  like perfection of the player piano's  performances;  the  second,  gendered  labor,  presents  player  pianos as labor-  saving replacements for women's labor at the keyboard; the third, educational labor, portrays the player piano as a pedagogical machine capable of teaching children to play the piano; and the fourth depicts the player piano as a device that stores and reproduces musical labor as an ownable, and stockpile-  able commodity. Among the advertisements, many draw from two or more categories in order to reach a broader audience. Throughout them all, the presence or absence of a laboring human body-  or a laboring ghostly figure-  reveals much about musical labor and its value in this time of rapid change, mass production, and mechanical reproduction.

Labor in early 20th-  century musical culture involved a new market of consumers due to what Michael Denning terms the ' 'proletarianization' of American culture, the increased influence on and participation of workingclass Americans in the world of culture and the arts' (1997, xvii). Denning claims that 'this was largely the result of a remarkable expansion of what is usually called mass culture: on the one hand, secondary and higher education; and on the other, the industries of entertainment and amusement' (Denning 1997, xvii). The experience of listening to music had long been a  commodity to be sold and consumed (Attali 1985, 57). At the turn of the 20th century, surging sheet music sales confirmed music's commodity status, which was further demonstrated by the saturation of the market with phonograph records and piano rolls. Although composers and performers had gained a foothold in the 19th-  century marketplace, by the early 20th century large music publishing houses and record companies became more powerful  than  composers  while  phonographs  and  player  pianos  usurped the role of many laboring performers, providing relief for laboring women, but taking work from paid performers. The commodification of music relies upon these technologies; as Timothy D. Taylor argues, 'music could not exist as a commodity without the technologies involved with its making and transmission' (2007, 283). Taylor is referring not only to the player piano and  its  mechanism  and  rolls,  or  the  phonograph  and  its  records,  but  to the entire assemblage of technologies that go into producing a record, roll, player piano, and phonograph: the production and reproduction of a given musical recording involved multiple layers of technology and labor.

Documenting the broad changes that swept American labor, market, and business institutions in the 19th century owing to the rise in middle management, business historian Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. contended that in the years between the 1840s and 1920s, managerial laborers gradually replaced the individual laborers of the 18th century. 7  Modern enterprise internalized

economic  activities  between  units  within  one  larger  corporation  rather than smaller businesses spread across a given market (Chandler 1977, 3). Salaried employees, the middle managers, then monitored and coordinated the units within a corporation (Chandler 1977, 1). According to Chandler, this shift from the traditional small business model to larger enterprises of relatively independent units controlled by a new managing class was widespread. Rather than the invisible hand of God, proposed by Adam Smith, the visible hands of middle management guided the market.

The processes of mass production used to make the player piano and its rolls  are  similar  to  those  deployed  in  the  production of  automobiles and other goods, but the transformation of labor as it plays out on the player piano projects a particularly vivid image. Although Chandler's managerial labor  becomes  the  visible  hand  controlling  production  in  the  early  20th century, several player piano advertising campaigns center on the invisible hands of the instrument's player. The market's visible hands create an instrument that then renders its own player invisible as the player piano absorbs the laboring performer's body into its production model. While the visible hands of moderately skilled managers shape products for consumption, the highly skilled hands of the pianist fade away, specters of a lost model of production that are now put to work in order to sell it to a new audience.

## Perfect Labor

In his article on music, leisure, and work, Karl Miller writes about 'the idea that music should appear e/ffortless-  that its execution should not require work' (Miller 2008, 428). He cites Florence Hartley's late 19th-  century etiquette guide, wherein Hartley advises women to perform compositions that are 'less aspiring' in order to avoid a performance that might be compared with that of the 'most eminent' performers, against which the parlor performer will inevitably be regarded as second rate (1873, 187). Moreover, when  a  lady  does  play  the  piano  she  should  avoid  moving  her  body; 'swinging the body to and fro, moving the head, rolling the eyes, raising the hands too much, are all bad tricks, and should be carefully abstained from' (Hartley 1873, 187). The performer is to avoid any kind of movement that might suggest a musical performance was an exertion; her body should display no signs of labor. As Miller puts it, 'don't let them see you sweat' (2008, 428).

Hartley advises these young performers to play works that require only moderate skill, for 'it is better to play the simplest airs in a finished, faultless manner, than to play imperfectly the most brilliant variations' (1873, 189). Parlor performances of the late 19th century, then, demanded perfect execution of relatively simple works by a performer who did her best to hide her body behind her playing. As Miller puts it, 'denied ghostly status by their very lifeblood, young women had to work hard to make themselves invisible

at the piano' (2008, 431). From this perspective, mechanical instruments like the player piano made that invisibility a reality by enabling performers to achieve Miller's 'ghostly status.' The player piano is not limited by societal fears of pretension; the machine can and should be perfect in its execution of both simple and virtuosic works. Indeed, one prominent feature of player piano advertisements is the odd juxtaposition of humanity and mechanical perfection in marketing the rolls. Most advertisements use the word 'perfect' at least once, typically referring to the piano's recording abilities or its technical execution-  attributes that stem from the mechanical facets of the instrument.

Yet  many  advertisements  also  cite  the  perfection  in  the  player  piano's human-  like performance or artistry, features not typically associated with machines. The advertisements strive to construct the player piano as combining the best of both worlds: technically perfect mechanical performances with artistically perfect interpretation. Moreover, this perfection is achievable with very little skill or exertion on the pianolist's part; advertisements claim that 'anybody can play anything' because the mechanism is so easy to operate. While the actual ease of playing the instrument varies between models, operating a standard player piano involves the skilled movement of  levers-  the  pianolist  must perform the  music,  and  manipulating  the levers  and  pedals  requires  considerable  dexterity.  Yet  a  large  percentage of advertisements stressed the ease of operation alongside the instrument's ability  to  re-  enact  human  performances  with  perfect  accuracy.  In  these advertisements,  the  player  piano  becomes  a  stand-  in,  substituting  capital investment  for  what  originally  required  skilled  labor  as  the  instrument works tirelessly to recreate technically and artistically perfect performances. By  combining  mechanistic  perfection  with  humanistic  interpretation,  the player  piano  becomes  the  ultimate  realization  of  the  industrialized  labor practices discussed in Chapter 1.

A 1903 Kohler &amp; Campbell advertisement for the pianista piano player (a  push-  up  model),  shown  in  Figure  3.1,  claims  the  instrument  'knows no technical di/fficulties'  and  that  its  'perfection  in  execution  is  without a peer' (1903, 49). Pianistas were limited in range and had easily broken

Figure 3.1 Kohler &amp; Campbell, Pianista, The Music  Trade Review ,  1903

<!-- image -->

wooden fingers-  note that while the drawing of the pianista in this advertisement shows that it does not cover the very bottom of the piano's range, the upper register is hidden and the angle of the drawing makes it unclear as to whether the device can reach the top of the keyboard. Harvey Roehl claims,

the  advertising  for  these  machines  fails  to  point  out  that  they  usually played only sixty-  five of the normal 88-  note piano scale, and that this,  in  turn,  meant that the original composers' scores all had to be rearranged-  (and in many cases mutilated)-  to fit this range.

$$(2009, 12)$$

These push-  up models were also heavy and cumbersome, and somewhat di/fficult to move to and from the piano's keyboard-  in other words, moving and aligning the pianista for use required manual labor. Due in part to these challenges, pianistas were popular for only a few years, roughly from 1900 to 1905 (Roehl 2009, 12). In this light, Kohler &amp; Campbell's claim that the pianista piano player 'knows no technical di/fficulties' seems somewhat disingenuous, yet many other pianista advertisements made similar claims. 'Perfect in execution' puts the pianista at a level unachievable by human players, while 'Is without a peer' eliminates not only its mechanical competition but also any human player. While on the surface the advertisement is selling pianista piano players, a deeper reading reveals the marketing of mechanical labor as superior to its human counterpart.

A 1915 advertisement in McClure's magazine for the Emerson Automatic, shown in Figure 3.2, states, 'the supreme goal of the Player Piano-  perfect reproduction of hand-  playing-  is realized in the Emerson Automatic, the newest, most artistic and human of Player Pianos' (1915, Front Matter). The accompanying image shows a young woman singing while the piano plays her accompaniment. The advertisement claims that the roll sounds just like 'accomplished hands playing the keys' without any sort of 'Mechanical touch.' Rather, the instrument ' reproduces the interpretations of the great artists as they themselves played that particular music.' While the woman in Emerson's advertisement performs labor through singing, her accompaniment seems e/ffortless-  what once would have required two laboring bodies (or one skilled individual who could both play and sing) now requires only one. The advertisement claims that with the Emerson Automatic, singers can accompany themselves on the piano with minimal e/ffort-  the woman in the picture is not even looking at the piano, but simply holds the control in her right hand while the piano plays the roll. As she sings, she looks up and over to her left, suggesting that she performs for an audience of some kind, and her dress and pearls, the large area rug, and the spaciousness of the room suggest that she lives a financially comfortable lifestyle.

Figure 3.2 merson Automatic, E McClure's ,  1915

Some advertisements capitalize purely on the perfection of the recording and performing of the instrument. One advertisement for the Ampico player piano, shown in Figure 3.3, shows Sergei Rachmanino/ff at the keyboard superimposed over an incipit of his famous Prelude in C-  sharp minor , op. 3 no. 2. Ampico claims that only its brand of reproducing piano 'accurately records the playing of the artist,' and it lists the piano brands that work with its mechanism (1927, 1). The repetition of the word 'perfect' subtly recalls the mechanical nature of the instrument and its own ability to repeat stored performance. The advertisement draws on Rachmanino/ff's cultural capital by layering Rachmanino/ff's image, his music, a quote, the notion of a perfect recording of his playing, and finally a perfect re-  enactment of it. In so doing, this advertisement sells Ampico rolls and the Ampico mechanism and commodifies Rachmanino/ff's invisible presence.

Yet  the  advertisement  is  exaggerated-  Ampico  rolls  are  not exact replayings of Rachmanino/ff's performance not only because the rolls could be edited and re-  punched, but also because the distance between holes on the

Figure 3.3 Rachmaninoff and Ampico, Presto-  Times ,  1927

<!-- image -->

roll was limited by the roll-  punching capabilities of the punching machine. The 'perfect  re-  enactment'  claim  made  by  the  company  does  not  stand up to scrutiny. But the notion of a perfect performance-  of an ideal rendition without any errors but with all of the expressive and interpretational choices-  was what Ampico was selling.

The Ampico advertisement is one of many that emphasize the ease and perfection of the player piano. An advertisement for the Telektra, shown in Figure 3.4, depicts an intimate dinner party of four in one room with the  player  piano  shown  through  the  doorway,  playing  in  another  room; the piano entertains guests while they enjoy their dinner. The advertisement states, 'The wonderful Telektra will play your piano with perfect musical expression  while  you  and  your  guests  are  gathered  around  the  dinner table.' By emphasizing perfection and ease, such advertising copy sells the player piano as a kind of appliance, something that conveniently provides entertainment with only a minimal investment of skill or trouble from the pianolist.

## Gendered Labor

As touched upon in the discussion of Hartley's late 19th-  century etiquette manual, while music lessons were a requirement for all women of good education and social grace, amateur pianists were often heard to play poorly. Craig H. Roell writes that 'commentators lamented the frequent inability among girls and women to play even simple things on the piano well, and cited such depressing ratios as '94 percent' and 'nine-  tenths' as the dropout rate among piano students' (1989, 37). But this poor playing was rarely due to lack of e/ffort on the young woman's part; cultural standards of the late 19th and early 20th centuries lauded hard work and many females spent countless hours a day at the piano (Roell 1989, 37). Miller di/fferentiates between two kinds of work; the first 'defines work as physical or emotional exertion towards a goal. The second defines work as a means of making money'  (2008,  430).  The  latter  was  o/ff  limits  when  it  came  to  women and musical performance, at least for a young woman of good upbringing

in a Victorian home (Miller 2008, 428). In addition, Miller discusses the di/fferences  between  masculine  and  feminine  performances  at  the  keyboard. Females were expected to perform on command, but her skill was not to 'suggest music was more than a fanciful pastime'; her performance should appear easy and demonstrate her amateurism (2008, 427-  8). Male musicians, on the other hand, were often held to professional standards. These gender roles carry beyond the silent piano of the stage and parlor into portrayals of male and female bodies in player piano advertisements. Women use the player piano to enhance the domestic space, as a decorative piece of furniture, and a sign of her wealthy status and the leisure it a/ffords, since it liberates her from the need to practice at the keyboard.

A Welte-  Mignon advertisement from 1923 (Figure 3.5) shows a young woman and her parents; she has just received the reproducing piano as a graduation gift (Shaw 1923, 74). There is a larger image of a baby grand piano  in  a  large  room  with  a  large  window,  all  features  implying  the family is well-  to-  do. The parents look on as the daughter reacts to her gift,

Figure 3.5 Daughter and the Reproducing Welte-  Mignon, 1923

<!-- image -->

clutching her diploma in one hand and holding her mother's hand with the other. The extravagant purchase 'expresses [her parents'] love and pride'; the image encourages wealthy parents to surprise their daughters with the same gift and also suggests young women of some accomplishment should want  a  reproducing  piano  of  their  very  own,  something  to  'cherish  for years to come.' That the reproducing piano is the ideal graduation gift for the daughter rather than the son of the home stems from the silent piano's connection to family and home, a domestic, female space. Moreover, in this advertisement the connection between mother, daughter, and piano visually aligns  the  three  within  the  confines  of  the  room.  The  father  stands  next to the mother without touching her and his gaze is directed outside of the room; while the mother looks at her daughter and the daughter at her gift, the father seems deliberately disconnected, leaving the matters of the home up to the women.

This  advertisement  is  one  of  many  focused  on  females  and  domestic space, on the reproducing piano as an object that does not merely assist the female of the home by relieving her of domestic labor, but improves upon the  amateur  performances  she  would  have  given  by  reproducing  perfect performances produced by experts. By alleviating her burden and improving the quality of performances, the instrument appeals to menfolk, too-  while she has less to do, he enjoys better music when he gets home from work. As  Timothy  Taylor  writes,  'player  piano  advertisements  emphasized  the social status o/ffered by the player piano by depicting instruments in beautiful  houses,  with  well  dressed  people  enjoying  themselves'  (2007,  288). The family in this advertisement is attractive and well dressed and the room is well appointed with large windows, floor-  length curtains and a fringed lamp. More than selling the piano, this advertisement indicates the reproducing piano as an integral part of a certain kind of lifestyle: wealthy, fashionable people own reproducing pianos.

While most advertisements appealed to the lady of the house, there were some advertisements aimed at men and male spaces such as clubs, libraries, and dens. Figure 3.6 shows a 1912 advertisement from the Chicago Daily Tribune instructing  young  men  to  'buy  a  'petite'  for  your  club-  it's  the musical marvel of the age' (1912, 3). The advertisement emphasizes the petite player piano's practicality due to its small size, small price tag, and 30-  day  free  trial.  Interestingly,  the  petite  player  piano  has  no  keyboard, unlike the models marketed at women. The advertisement makes no reference to labor saving or to the traditional role of the pianist in the home.

## Educational Labor

Piano students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries often had to follow intensive programs of study such as Siegmund Lebert and Ludwig Stark's demanding Klavier Schule method, which 'became standard in the United States  as  German  pianists  drilled  in  the  method  came  to  this  country

Figure 3.6 The Petite Player Piano in  Y oung Men's Clubs, Chicago Daily  Tribune ,  1912

<!-- image -->

seeking disciples' (Roell 1989, 8). When applied to music instruction, the Victorian work ethic meant that young women spent hours practicing the piano, a process that Gerald Johnson likens to the torture of Chinese foot binding (1938, 22 and 77). The connections between music and women extended into the church and schoolhouse as well, and so advertisements that featured the educational aspects of the player piano were often aimed at women.

A  1925  advertisement  from The  Saturday  Evening  Post (Figure  3.7) features an image of a woman looking over a little girl's shoulder as she sits  at  the  player  piano.  Beneath  the  image  a  caption  reads,  '  'I like my music lessons.'  ' The advertisement claims a player piano equipped with the Standard Player Action 'encourages children in the study of music.' The company sells educational music rolls-  rolls that do not replace the music teacher but rather enhance and clarify her work. In their simplification, the educational rolls reduce the amount of labor required of the piano teacher. Moreover, the advertisement evinces an awareness of the tedium of piano lessons for most students, and claims to transform the lessons into enjoyable activities for teacher and student.

An advertisement for the 'Baby Ampico' calls the piano an 'ideal instrument for classroom work in schools.' The advertisement includes an image of  a  male  teacher  standing  at  the  piano,  apparently  using  the  instrument as  an  aid  in  a  music  appreciation  class.  The  advertisement  mentions  the low top of the piano, which allows the teacher to easily see over it, and the compact instrument's convenient portability, enabling it to be relocated to di/fferent classrooms (Roehl 2009, 59). A similar advertisement for the Baby Ampico  shows  the  instrument  in  the  dance  studio  of  Alexis  Koslo/ff  and suggests it to dance teachers as 'the perfect accompanying instrument.' The Baby Ampico comes with a 'brilliant repertoire' and is 'always at hand' to 'supply at a moment's notice whatever music may be required. … It is easily moved from place to place. It is always available. It can play anything. As it draws no salary its possession means a large eventual saving to the dancing teacher' (Roehl 2009, 66).

Beyond using the player piano as an accompanist, an aid to the music teacher,  or  in  the  music  classroom,  one  1922  pamphlet  titled  'The

De-  Assification  of  Music:  A  Propagandist  Magazine  of  One  Number, Containing  News  of  Importance  to  all  Music  Lovers,  Especially  to  all Owners of Player Pianos,' by Carroll Brent Chilton, suggests the use of what Chilton calls the 'universal music reader.' Indeed, the entire magazine is one giant advertisement for this mechanism, and the player piano serves as a valuable performer and instructor. Chilton's music reader rotates the piano roll and its mechanism so it unrolls from right to left rather than from bottom to top. The roll, in addition to the regular punches, contains the composer's 'original text,' as well as a 'critical description and appreciation of the music being sounded.' Chilton claims that using the universal music reader will 'transform the player-  piano from a toy and entertainer into a practical instrument of precision for musical education' (1922, 3). Towards  the  middle  of  the  magazine,  Chilton  compares  the  old  player piano to the player piano fitted with the universal mechanism. As shown in Figure 3.8, the former appears in a grainy photo with a caption deeming it

'ordinary,' the latter has an excited (and glamorous) woman clasping her hands in delight as she watches the roll go by in the 'modern way' (1922, 25).  The  universal  music  reader  combines  the  score,  the  roll,  lyrics,  and biographical commentary in the ultimate realization of the piano roll's educational potential.

Despite  Chilton's  valiant e/fforts, the mechanism  never  caught  on. Moreover, while many schools including the Paris Conservatoire, London's Royal Academy of Music, the Eastman School of Music, Harvard University, UCLA, and many public primary and secondary school districts purchased player  pianos  in  the  mid-  1920s,  they  were  quickly  rendered  obsolete  by recorded music (Roehl 2009, 76). Wear and tear on the rolls made them impractical  for  classroom  use  when  compared  with  live  piano  playing. Nonetheless, some pianists learned from watching and imitating the keys of the player piano. In some cases this involved a kind of reverse engineering of an imaginary performance practice, as many rolls were punched directly from the score and thus were never originally 'performed.' 8  Fats Waller and Duke Ellington both learned stride pieces by mimicking piano rolls. 9

Lifting  his  hands,  [Waller]  gave  the  pedals  a  slight  pump  and  a  new chord was struck on the piano. Again his hands went to the keyboard and he fitted his hands to the keys, shaking his head as he found he was unable to span the distance with a single hand. Then he disconnected the  locking  mechanism  and  played  the  two  chords  by  himself,  or  as much as he could reach with his short fingers.

(Kirkeby 1966, 32)

The  player  piano's  educational  value  far  outlasted  its  marketing  appeal. While  the  advertisements  claimed  it  would  ease  the  labor  of  instructors while making students' labor more enjoyable, the player piano's educational success came from those who went to it out of necessity, to learn pieces that were otherwise unteachable (and unreachable).

## Stored and Reproduced Labor

Advertisements that focus on the storing and reproducing of labor most often  center  on  works  or  performances  by  famous  individuals.  Many  of these advertisements claim that the piano roll stores and the player piano re-  enacts the work as the composer intended, thus indirectly suggesting that any at-  home amateur performance is somehow an inauthentic rendition of the work and that roll editors somehow have a more accurate idea of the (often long-  dead) composer's intent. Many advertisements also invoke the images of dead composers to lend their piano rolls credibility; combining images of well-  established composers in the western canon with the image of the player piano and its roll softens the modernity of the instrument. Or,

the advertisement may claim a particular performer's version of the work as ideal, superior in interpretation and virtuosic skill. Advertisements in this category represent the labor of a particular performer as superior to the labor of any amateur, even when mediated through the piano roll. They draw on quotations from performers and composers attesting to the roll's accuracy in storing and transmitting both conceptions and performances.

Figure 3.9 shows one 1913 example of an advertisement that focuses on the storing and reproduction of a kind of authentic labor. It advertises the Starr Piano Company and shows a woman at the pianola with a roll sprawled above the picture, studded with pictures of Beethoven, Handel, J.S.  Bach,  Haydn,  Wagner,  and  Liszt.  Starr  claims  their  player  piano 'removes every barrier of technical inability and gives you access to all the

Figure 3.9 erforming the 'Music of the Masters,' P The  Tennessean ,  1913

<!-- image -->

music of all time' (1913, 4). 10  The looming busts of the masters lend the player piano performances composer-  ratified credibility within the musical economy.

Figure 3.10 shows an advertisement for the Apollo Reproducing Piano that uses Beethoven's ghostly image to sell piano rolls. The advertisement asks, 'If Beethoven could be heard by us today playing his sonatas, what would we not give to know the master's own interpretations?' (1922, 76). Below the text is a grand piano with a ghostly Beethoven at the bench and the opening of the score to his Moonlight Sonata , op. 27, no. 2. According to the advertisement, 'today, the works of composers are preserved exactly as played by them; also the works of the classicists as interpreted by living masters.'  The  ghostly  Beethoven  has  little  to  do  with  the  reproducing piano's actual capabilities; a more realistic image would be of a living composer at the piano recording his or her performance on piano roll, or of a famous contemporary pianist recording a classic work such as Beethoven's Moonlight . The uncanny situation presented in the advertisement evokes a

Figure 3.10 Beethoven's Ghost at the Apollo Keyboard, House &amp; Garden ,  1922

<!-- image -->

longing in the audience, for whom the reproducing piano serves as a quasispiritual medium.

Figure  3.11  shows  a  1909  Cecilian  Player  Piano  advertisement  from Putnam's  Magazine that  also  features  a  spectral  Beethoven  (1909,  Front Matter). This advertisement asks consumers to imagine playing Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata 'as you would like to play it.' It references the inferiority of the average amateur pianist and suggests that a better performance, like that provided by the player piano, imbues the work with Beethoven's inspiration. This particular advertisement makes it seem as if the roll conjures Beethoven's spirit as it plays; he casually leans on the piano, enjoying-  and apparently endorsing-  the player piano's rendition of his work. The invisible  hands  guiding  the  performance  are  Beethoven's  own,  overseeing  the interpretation and technical execution of his work. The headline claims the Cecilian  plays  with  'the  inspiration  of  the  master,'  while  the  labor  that powers the performance is powered by a man sitting at the bench with his

Figure 3.11 Beethoven Inspires through the Cecilian, Putnam's Magazine ,  1909

<!-- image -->

hands on the keyboard and feet on the pedals. In this case, it is significant that the image features a man rather than a woman insofar as he stands in as Beethoven's proxy.

Angelus  released  an  advertisement  centered  around  composer  Pietro Mascagni,  shown  in  Figure  3.12,  who  calls  the  Angelus  'a  wonderful virtuoso-  pianist' that is capable of 'marvelous means of expression [that can] give the complicated pieces more life and soul than any other instrument of its kind is able to give' (Shaw 1902, 179). Below Mascagni's quote, instead  of  a  literal  signature  (as  in  the  Welte-  Mignon  advertisements),  it reads  '(Signed)  PIETRO  MASCAGNI.'  By  including  the  quotation  and a/ffixing Mascagni's quoted signature to the advertisement, Angelus places more value on Mascagni's labor as reproduced by the player piano than the e/ffort expended by the amateur performer in a live performance. The advertisement includes a photograph of Mascagni alongside an image of a young

Figure 3.12 ietro Mascagni, 1902 P

<!-- image -->

woman at a push-  up pianola with a treble-  clef score just above her head. This latter image, along with the simplistic treble-  clef melody on the score, touches on the player piano's easy-  to-  play nature. Oddly enough, the score pictured would take very little training to play-  it hardly illustrates the difficult passages Mascagni and the player piano were capable of carrying out. Yet while the Angelus can handle more complex pieces, the woman need not understand even the most basic line. The same point comes through in Mascagni's quote, when he cites the 'complicated pieces' that perhaps the pictured woman would not be able to play. Another aspect hidden in this advertisement is that Mascagni's quote does not compare the Angelus' performance to that of a live pianist; he simply states that it is the best of its kind. The implication is that it cannot play as well as he can, even if its abilities surpass those of the woman in the picture.

Much  like  Mascagni's  advertisement  for  the  Angelus,  many  other companies used the words of famous pianists to sell their player pianos. Theodor  Leschetitzky  played  for  Welte-  Mignon,  Victor  Herbert  for  the Duo-  Art, J. Milton Delcamp for Ampico, and Edvard Grieg, Rudolph Ganz, Ferruccio Busoni, and Ignacy Jan Paderewski appear in advertisements for multiple companies including Apollo, Ampico, Sohmer, Duo-  Art, and WelteMignon. In other words, multiple large companies used the same pianists to lend credibility to their instruments and rolls. Advertisements featuring pianists and composers tend to take one of two approaches: first, list several names-  one Sohmer advertisement lists Grieg, Paderewski, Richard Strauss, Ossip  Gabrilowitsch,  Xaver  Scharwenka,  and  Teresa  Carreño  as  pianist composers and then Josef Hofmann, Vladimir de Pachmann, Rudolph Ganz, Busoni, Josef Lhévinne, Theodor Leschetitzky, Ernö Dohnányi, and 'a host of others' as performers-  or second, feature one pianist in a manner similar to the Mascagni advertisement discussed above (Roehl 2009, 78).

Some pianist-  focused advertisements make little mention of the recordings themselves beyond a concluding sentence of he/  she 'records exclusively' for the company in question (Roehl 2009, 67). Other pianists' advertisements mention the interpretive features of the recordings; Ganz asserts that he

had no di/fficulty in getting the tone results I wanted in my records. The climaxes are worked up just as I played them. The distinction between voices, between theme and accompaniment, are practically perfect. The intonation and phrasing add the last convincing touch of personality and the tone-  production pleases me much.

He goes on to call the instrument's tempo and phrasing 'perfect-  true to my performance. My typical rhythmical characteristics, my rubati, my most personal ways, are exactly duplicated' (Roehl 2009, 53). Yet it is telling that Ganz terms the distinctions as practically perfect, not perfect, and that he calls the intonation and phrasing 'convincing,' as if the roll had something

to prove to him. Moreover, he remarks that the roll duplicates his personal way of playing-  the roll is a copy rather than a representation of the original playing.

Beyond  ghostly  composers  or  living  performers,  other  advertisements feature famous composers whose lives overlapped with the player piano. Grieg and Debussy both recorded piano rolls for Welte-  Mignon and were featured  in  advertisements  for  the  company.  The  Welte-  Mignon  logo  or name does not appear in the advertisement except when named in quotes by  the  composers;  it  is  as  if  the  advertisements  are  mini-  features  on  the composer pianists, rather than copy selling player pianos (Roehl 2009, 48). Welte-  Mignon was not the only company to draw on the cultural capital of famous composers; Duo-  Art published an advertisement featuring George Gershwin  who  'records  his  piano  playing  exclusively  for  the  Duo-  Art' (Roehl 2009, 51). By selling Gershwin, Grieg, or Debussy's performances of their own works, companies like Welte-  Mignon and Duo-  Art capitalized on the labor of a few highly skilled individuals, reproduced in an industrialized labor  setting  akin  to  Chandler's  large  enterprise  system.  The  hands  of Gershwin, Grieg, or Debussy, though literally invisible at the player piano, are perceptible through their signatures both in advertisements and on the rolls themselves.

In terms of mechanical performance as it compares to live performance, these advertisements thus fall into two broad categories-  those that attest to the superiority of the mechanical instrument over live performance, and those that describe it as a competent stand-  in for the concert pianist. In both cases, the player piano comes o/ff as a more capable performer than the amateur. If player piano rolls are second only to concert pianists and piano rolls capture and reproduce the performances of those pianists to be played on any piano equipped with the proper machinery, what need is there for the amateur to labor over the keys?

The value and demand for the skilled performances of a few high-  ranking musicians recorded on piano rolls creates a market akin to the large enterprise model of Chandler's visible hand theory. Pictures in magazines advertise the visible hands of Paderewski, Ganz, Debussy, et al., and subsequently conceal  the  laboring  hands  of  the  workers  who  edited,  reproduced,  and manufactured the rolls as well as the hands of the laboring pianolist required for non-  reproducing models. The performers are the highly skilled laborers whose products are controlled and marketed by middle management, a class of workers that came into being through the creation of large corporations. The invisible hand that guided earlier musicians to success through their e/ffort as individual players and the roles they played within specific communities withdraws: the road to success inclines sharply upward and celebrity virtuosos, through international distribution and marketing, become ever further removed from the average individual.

## Conclusion

Through player piano advertisements, this chapter examines four approaches towards marketing the player piano within the industrialized labor economy of the early 20th century. The first pushes the instrument's perfect technique, its flawless execution of the most di/fficult and intricate combinations  of  keys.  The  perfect  performances  delivered  by  the  player piano  alleviate  some  pressure  from  young  Victorian  women  who  were expected to play moderately di/fficult pieces perfectly,  and  di/fficult  pieces only in practice. The player piano has no such limitations and can reproduce as if played by the ghostly hands of a concert pianist. Indeed, some advertisements  included  images  of  those  ghostly  fingers,  large  masculine hands, the phantom hands of the established pianist. The second approaches advertising from the woman's perspective, reducing her duties at the keyboard and appealing to her sense of fashion and beauty. The third section addresses the player piano as pedagogical assistant, or even as a teacher in some cases, aiding music instructors or teaching young students to play the piano through imitation. The final section discusses advertisements that use the player piano as a device to store and reproduce highly skilled labor, labor often initially recorded by a male pianist or composer.

In each category, the labor inherent in the roll is an invisible labor, the output of which is programmed into the roll and reanimated by the mechanism. Many rolls included the signature of the pianist, especially on reproducing piano rolls, in which case the pianist becomes the visible figure of production.  The  pianist's  laboring  hands  become  the  visible  synecdoche of the labor of all of the other hands-  which are themselves synecdoches for the laboring bodies-  that helped produce that roll. In the home, piano rolls  took  work  from  young  women  who  had  previously  been  expected to act as in-  home entertainment centers, providing conversation, dancing, and music.

While  the  player  piano's  popularity  fell  greatly  during  and  after  the Great Depression, its e/ffect on musical labor carries through to the current day. By the 1930s and 1940s, recording technology overtook the musical marketplace,  quickly  overwhelming  the  bulky  player  piano  with  small cabinet  Victrolas,  tabletop  phonographs,  and  slim  records.  These  evershrinking technologies act as early indicators of the obsession with portable, tiny gadgets in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Meanwhile, music's space on the shelf has diminished from score to roll, record to CD, and CD to MP3 (Sterne 2012). The machine has fully absorbed the musical product, rendering musical labor invisible to consumers but for its aural evidence, typically edited and altered far beyond the evidence resulting directly from the manual labor of its performers. In the end, Smith's invisible hand turns out to be the ghostly appendage animating the machine.

- 3  Philip Auslander describes the player piano as a necessary part of the 'historical progression of technologies of musical reproduction,' a progression he delineates through Baudrillard's three orders of simulacra. The 'original' object is the live human performance; any other presentation is a copy. Auslander suggests 'the player piano is a first-  order simulacrum, a device that counterfeits a human performance but clearly is not human.' The player piano's first order status ties it to humanity; a sharp contrast from the second-  order status of the phonograph record 'whose reference back to an original artifact has been rendered irrelevant.' For Auslander, the visual human presence evidenced by the depressing of keys when paired with the literal playing of an acoustic instrument render the player piano performance more similar to a live human performance (2008, 116-  17).

- 5  I rely upon American examples because, as Reebee Garofalo explains, 'at key points in the development of the mass media, the industrialization of popular music has been defined disproportionately by the dominant and often controversial practices of the United States' (1999, 318).
- 6  Some models remained in production into the late 1930s. According to Harvey Roehl, 'a few machines [were] built in the early thirties,  and  the  late  model Ampico Reproducing grand pianos were built as late as 1936 and perhaps even later on special order. A few hundred of the Ampico spinet model reproducers were built in the very late thirties, but this was the last of any players in America until the Aeolian Company introduced its key-  top Pianola in 1950' (2009, 40).
- 7  18th-  century economist Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations includes the following famous passage:

As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that  its  produce  may  be  of  the  greatest  value;  every  individual  necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it … He intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of his intention. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more e/ffectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who a/ffected to trade for the public good.

Smith's term caught on among economists who claim the 'invisible hand'-  a thinly veiled reference to the hand of God-  guided the labor relations in the free market capitalist economy (Smith (1776) 1852, 184).

## Absolute Music and the Player Piano

## Introduction

The player piano presented composers with a unique opportunity: to preserve a piano composition as the composer wanted it to sound, unadulterated by a performer's interpretation. It promised to realize Igor Stravinsky's dream to get 'rid of the performers' (Amirkhanian 1977, 15). The possibility that the piano roll stores a kind of unfiltered performance brings up what Carl Dahlhaus calls 'the idea of absolute music,' which he defines as 'independent instrumental music … [that] purely and clearly expresses the true nature of music by its very lack of concept, object and purpose … as pure 'structure.'  ' This definition has an interesting role in light of recording technology because it allows for a more 'independent' instrumental performance-  a performance that lacks the present, laboring body of a human performer (Dahlhaus 1989, 7).

In  this  chapter  I  set  up  my  discussion  with  an  overview  of  Dahlhaus' 'idea of absolute music,' Jean-  Jacques Nattiez's notion of the performer as music box, and how the player piano fits in unexpected ways with each. To illustrate  how  the  concept  of  absolute  music  shifts  in  light  of  mechanical reproduction, I discuss the player piano and its music across three stages: first with an example from 1917, before its highest sales peak, second with a few examples from the instrument's heyday in the 1920s, and third from the 1940s, once it had mostly disappeared from the mass market. Brief analytical glances at the mechanistic features of a few works show how the musical content suits the mechanical performer and how the definition of absolute music shifts over time. I will examine first, Stravinsky's Étude  pour  Pianola (1917,  hereafter  referred  to  as Étude ),  second,  a few examples from the instrument's heyday, including works by Alfredo Casella,  Ernst  Toch,  and  Paul  Hindemith,  and  third,  a  later  example, Conlon Nancarrow's Study No. 2 (undated, but likely from between 1948 and 1960) (Gann 1995, 68).

## 'Music for Music's Sake'

Each of the composers discussed in the following sections exploits the player piano as a mechanical performer, a performer that, theoretically, functions as a medium for a composer's musical intentions as opposed to a live performer who includes their own interpretation. 1  Indeed, the player piano reneges on one of the basic promises of musical performance: the fallible performer. As such, it represents one particularly vexing step on music's path from an exclusively human and a-  mechanical endeavor to a mechanically recorded, stored,  and  mediated  experience.  The  player  piano  promises  a  new  kind of absolute music to its listener, free from a performer's personal, a/ffective influence or error. But the achievement of absolute music as unadulterated performance remains elusive even in its mechanical execution. Mechanical music  reshapes  the  definition  of  absolute  music  by  allowing  composers to  explore  music  without  the  pianist-  as-  mediator  influencing  the  musical product. Removing this interpretive middleman, then, makes it seem as if the performance issued is closer to what the composer imagined it to be.

The definition of absolute music has evolved over time, and it is a complex concept with what Roger Lustig describes as having 'many facets,' including

the  quasi-  religious  function  of  listening,  whereby  proper  hearing  of sublime music can a/fford  the  listener  a  glimpse  of  the  infinite,  or  of the Beyond, or at least produce an esthetic experience above mundane ideas, images, and things; and the formalist view of music that equates form and content.

(Dahlhaus 1989, viii)

The term 'absolute music' comes from Wagner, and the concept first took hold in Germany in the early 19th century and spread into France by the end of the century (Dahlhaus 1989, 3). 2  In the 19th century, absolute music competed with what Dahlhaus calls the 'older idea of music … the concept, originating  in  antiquity  and  never  doubted  until  the  seventeenth  century, that  music,  as  Plato  put  it,  consisted  of harmonia , rhythmos ,  and logos ' (1989, 8). While 18th-  century instrumental music accompanied the higher art of vocal music, 19th-  century Romanticism flipped the two. Instrumental music became the model for autonomous music, as philosophers believed instrumental music represented itself not as something beneath language but something above it (Dahlhaus 1989, 8-  9). As Mark Evan Bonds defines it, '  'Absolute Music' … manifests itself most clearly in compositions that have no text to be sung and no titles or accompanying descriptive terms that might in some way suggest what a particular work might be 'about'  ' (2014, 1).

The notion of 'music for music's sake' gave rise to Eduard Hanslick's pivotal formalist essay on absolute music, On the Musically Beautiful (1854).

For  Hanslick,  musical  meaning  reaches  its  full  potential  in  instrumental music, which he claims is the only music that can be absolute. He writes, 'Of what instrumental music cannot do, it ought never be said that music can do it, because only instrumental music is music purely and absolutely' (1986, 15). Hanslick claims that composers' ideas are purely musical ideas, and these are musical content (1986, 10). In his oft-  cited third chapter on beauty in music he writes, 'the content of music is tonally moving forms,' which  summarizes  his  formalistic  standpoint  toward  musical  form  and musical content-  for Hanslick, the two are the same. 3  While Hanslick goes on to address the roles of composer and listener-  he initially skips over the performer-  he says that the 'autonomous artwork turns out to be in fact an e/fficacious mediator between two kinetic powers, its whence and its whither, i.e., the composer and the hearer' (1986, 45). The artwork mediates, then, not the performer.

When Hanslick addresses the performer's role he mandates an ethic: the performer  should  reproduce  a  musical  work  (i.e.,  be  true  to  the  score's indications) and imbue it with the necessary 'spark' that then brings the work to life. He writes that in a performance the performer 'is granted to release directly the feeling which possesses him, through his instrument, and breathe into his performance the wild storms, the passionate fervour, the serene power and joy of his inwardness' (1986, 48-  9). Hanslick's phrasing inadvertently  foreshadows  the  player  piano's  ghostly  performer  when  he describes the work 'possessing' the performer. In addition, he compares the composer and performer as opposites: the composer works slowly, the performer in 'impetuous flight'; the composer forms the work, the performer creates a passionate, momentary experience; the composer for the future, the performer for the present (1986, 49).

Yet in light of mechanical reproduction, issues of presence and absence are less clearly defined: can a performer's spark be present if his or her body is not? The notion of the 'spirit' or 'spark' can exist both within a piece or its performer. The role of the performer in recreating the musical work in a traditional performance sets up the cultural practices that change dramatically with mechanical reproduction; if the performer's presence at the bench was never mandatory for the transmission of a meaningful work then the  performer's  ultimate  absence  would  be  irrelevant.  The  player  piano's ghostly performer suggests just that the player piano mechanizes or electrifies key elements of a musical performance so that its reproduction becomes possible without the performer's present body. The player piano separates the spark from the body, then, and allows the performer's spirit, the absolute spirit of the work, to play.

In sum, while Hanslick considers instrumental music to be the purest of absolute music, it still needs the spirit of a performer to reproduce the work. The performer, then, is not fully possessed by the composer's spirit like a mindless body temporarily enchanted. Rather, the moving recreation of a

musical work requires the performer's interpretive input. But the performer's interpretive  input  is  problematic  whether  present  or  absent.  Edited  rolls, which o/ffer an idealized version of a performance, can be altered to present an even more complex rendition of the work and its interpretation.

## Keeping Score

The musical score is a visual object, a visual representation of a sonic object. The visual score is, in a sense, stunted-  Daniel K.L. Chua writes, 'the score grasps the totality for the individual ego, enabling it to possess the music as a commodity which it owns but cannot play ' (1999, 55). The performer reproduces, interprets, and plays; the score contains, visualizes, and commodifies. As the previous section details, musical performance, if it is to be a 'true reproduction,' requires the subjective spontaneity of the performer; through  this  spontaneity  the  performer  transforms  musical  form  into musical content. But the validity of a performer's interpretation depends on what philosopher Theodor W. Adorno calls the performer's 'precision and focus … first in the analysis of the written score, and then in its retranslation into sound' (2006a, 204). And so if the performer-  even an inferior oneis still a necessary component of musical reproduction, what of these mechanical performances, where the player piano plays itself without a present, skilled performer? Can these performances still be 'true' reproductions? And, to delve into murkier waters, are reproductions, by nature, always already something less than an original?

For Hanslick, the performer's job is to be present, active, and passionate, but Hanslick also claims that the artwork mediates between composer and listener; the performer's role in this mediation is less than clear. If the artwork mediates and a mechanical instrument can e/ffectively deliver the composer's conception of the artwork then the performer becomes superfluous. Either the mechanical instrument must have its own spark-  coaxing spirit or it is nothing more than a contrived music box, incapable of moving the listener. It is interesting to note that while Hanslick elevates the composer, the hearer, and the work into a kind of communicative web, he demotes the performer to  a  role  very  similar  to  a  mechanical  instrument.  Possessed  by  the  roll and its reproducing mechanism, the player piano reproduces the artwork, but this possession requires an animate presence in the player piano. This possession places a kind of spirit within the reproducing mechanism, a ghost in the machine. Perhaps for Hanslick, the player piano presents the opportunity for a passionate performance complete with a performer's heart and soul. As the roll rotates within the body of the player piano it conjures a performer's invisible fingers to press the keys and coax the music's electric spark from the perforated paper, where it lies dormant.

Dahlhaus'  definition  of  absolute  music  as  instrumental  music  that purely and clearly represents musical structures works well with mechanical instruments; indeed, it works better than a live performer in a way, as

in theory the mechanical performer's interpretation does not impede upon the translation of musical form to the listener. However, when the mechanical elements of the instrument-  the roll whirring, the pedals pumping, the sounds of the inner workings of the machine-  along with the mechanical elements of its rendition-  its overly exact rhythms and in some cases oddly emphasized melodies-  influence the musical content of the piece, the live performer and mechanical performer fall onto a more even playing field, as each obstructs the communication of musical form. Thus, for Dahlhaus, the performing ghost at the player piano bench is as intrusive as the visible, live performer.

While  the  mechanical  performer  could  present  a  possible  ideal  for Hanslick's theory of absolute music, and for Dahlhaus' theory the mechanical  is  just  as  problematic  as  the  human,  for  Nattiez  the  performer  is already  little  more  than  that  of  a  music  box.  Nattiez  specifically  writes, 'the performer does not strictly speaking create the work, but instead gives it  access  to  a  sonorous  existence'  (1990,  72).  Nattiez  also  writes  of  the performer's interpretation as having two meanings: the first in performing the work, the second in personally selecting interpretants. 4  If the performer is there just to give sound to the work and to choose what parts of a work to bring out, then the machine easily replaces Nattiez's performer. Editors programmed the reproducing roll, in particular, to deliver certain interpretations to the listener, who in turn must engage with the musical material as it is presented. Nattiez places the actualization of absolute music squarely onto  the  shoulders  of  the  listener,  and  thus  he,  perhaps  unintentionally, circumvents the theoretical issues of mechanical performance.

For  Dahlhaus  and  Nattiez,  then,  mechanical  performances  do  little  to change the music itself; the absolute content of the music remains the same whether played by man or machine. Hanslick, writing decades before the player piano and the Machine Age, writes a theory of musical aesthetics that specifically cites the music box as something incapable of delivering a meaningful presentation of the work. He writes, 'A mechanical music box cannot move the feelings of a listener, but the simplest amateur musician will do it if he is soulfully absorbed in his tune' (Hanslick 2018, 68). But the player piano's performances, while mechanically modeled on the music box's rotated tined barrel, e/ffectively transmit the work in a way that fits Hanslick's requirements. When Hanslick promotes the composer and listener to a level above the performer, the opposite is also true-  he demotes the performer into a kind of automaton, a mechanical body awaiting possession by the meaningful work. Moreover, the performer's 'spark' is similar to the power provided to the player piano, whether through pumping foot pedals or electricity. Bonds writes that

Hanslick's view of music as a wholly self-  contained art … would figure prominently  in  several  currents  of  modernist  aesthetics  in  the  early twentieth century … even if figures like Schoenberg, Stravinsky, and

Hindemith had no desire to be associated with a critic from a previous generation whose reputation was that of a hard-  boiled reactionary. (2014, 3)

Reading theories of absolute music, especially Hanslick's work, in light of mechanical performance shows how the two areas overlap. The mechanical performer serves as the ideal mechanical realization of Hanslick's musical aesthetics-  the  music  roll  contains  a  kind  of  performing  spirit  complete with  passionate  interpretational  meaning,  capable  of  coaxing  the  work's electric spark. The spirit of the roll, present and active with the artificially polished passion of a live performer, articulates absolute music in a perfect realization of instrumental music. Freed not only of the human voice but also of the human body, the player piano recreates absolute music in a way the live performer never could. Composers like Stravinsky and Nancarrow latch on to this possibility.

## The Player Piano and the Cutting Edge

Composers like Stravinsky and Nancarrow were drawn to the player piano at least in part because it gave the composer a new level of control over the product; the player piano allowed for new pianistic executions unconfined by any real performer's technique. Indeed, Stravinsky openly criticized performers both for their physical limitations and interpretational choices. He writes,

In  order  to  prevent  the  distortions  of  my  compositions  by  future interpreters,  I  had  always  been  anxious to find a means of imposing some restriction on the notorious liberty, especially widespread today, which prevents the public from obtaining a correct idea of the author's intentions. This possibility was now a/fforded by the rolls of the mechanical piano.

(1962, 69)

And in a 1925 interview, Stravinsky said, 'There is a new polyphonic truth in  the  player-  piano.  There  are  new  possibilities.  It  is  something  more.  It is  not  the  same  thing  as  the  piano.  …  It  shares  the  soul  of  the  automobile'  (V.  Stravinsky  and  Craft  1979,  44).  David  Suisman  claims,  'in  the 1910s and 1920s composers Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith, Ernst Toch, and others approached the player-  piano as a novel tool of musical expression-  that is, as a means to create new sounds not available through conventional composition and manual instrumentation' (2010, 29). Suisman then lists Nancarrow as the 'greatest of these experimentalists' because he wrote works that 'played faster and with more notes than any human could execute,  in  intersecting  rhythmic  patterns  of  vertiginous,  mathematical

complexity that showered auditors with cascading waves of sound' (2010, 29). Indeed, Nancarrow shared Stravinsky's dream of a performer-  less performance. For them, the player piano was an instrument that could conjure absolute music, drawing the music's spirit out of the instrument to occupy the empty bench.

Stravinsky,  Casella,  Hindemith,  Toch,  and  Nancarrow  composed  for player piano at di/fferent stages of the instrument's history. Working in 1917, Stravinsky wrote his Étude at the tail end of the First World War and several years before the instrument's peak in the early 1920s. The general mechanization of labor and production influenced musical production after the war, especially regarding the recording and distribution of phonograph records and piano rolls. But the recorded object itself, as a kind of commodified perfect performance, presented editors and composers with a unique opportunity to bypass the performer as laborer and also to reproduce and distribute versions of a work that supposedly fit the composer's intent.

The  performing  machine  presented  two  unique  opportunities:  first,  to show o/ff the skills of a particular composer/  performer, or second to compose music that is unlimited by a performer's hands. The first opportunity is  demonstrated  through  novelty  rags  by  composers  such  as  Felix  Arndt and Zez Confrey, discussed in Chapter 1. Arndt and Confrey composed rags and then recorded rolls of (or editors hand-  punched transcriptions of) their own performances, marketing not only the work but their particular renditions.  The  second  opportunity is in examples by famous composers like  Claude  Debussy,  Sergei  Rachmanino/ff,  and  George  Gershwin  who recorded rolls of their own versions of their works. 5  This chapter focuses on the second opportunity, as evidenced first through a discussion and analysis of Stravinsky's Étude , which is rather conservative, only pushing the work slightly beyond the capabilities of a solo pianist despite the fact that piano rolls allowed for much greater access to the keyboard.

Stravinsky's fascination with the player piano led to a relatively highpaying  contract  with  the  Pleyel  Company  of  Paris,  a  contract  that  the Aeolian  Company  in  New  York  bought  out  in  1924. 6   His  contract stipulated  that  he  would  transcribe  his  complete  works  for  the  Pleyel mechanical piano, and he arranged The Firebird , Petrushka , The Rite of Spring , Pulcinella , Les Noces , and others. In addition to his transcriptions, Stravinsky only wrote one work specifically for player piano, his Étude . When he described why he was drawn to the instrument, Stravinsky wrote, 'Aeolian  wrote  me  (sic)  during  the  war  and  o/ffered  me  considerable 'payola' for an original piece for pianola. The idea of being performed by rolls of perforated paper amused me, and I was attracted by the mechanics of the instrument'(Stravinsky and Craft 1981, 70). His Étude serves as an early example of music written for player piano and it models what composers might have thought as pushing the boundaries of composition and mechanical performance in the 1910s.

In his book Stravinsky and the Piano , Charles M. Joseph writes that even though Stravinsky dedicated '  'hundreds of hours of work' in preparing as many as 77 'pleyelization rolls,' as he referred to them, [the rolls are] a part of the composer's productivity that continues to remain only on the periphery of his biography' (1983, 93). Beyond their apparently low biographical value, pianolist Rex Lawson speculates,

Pleyel cannot have made much money from the sale of Stravinsky's rolls, for they paid the composer on five counts for each and every roll of his that they manufactured, whether or not it was subsequently sold. The payments were for the mechanical copyright, for exclusivity (since the rolls represented the very first 'recordings' of the works concerned), for the arrangement of the work for music roll, for the performance of the work (even though Stravinsky did not actually record any of the rolls at a keyboard), and for the musical copyright of the original work. (Igor Stravinsky and the Pianola)

Needless to say, Stravinsky's contract with Pleyel did not last its expected length  even  after  the  Aeolian  Company  bought  it  in  1924;  in  1925  he went to America to record for the Duo-  Art system. Stravinsky's loyalties shifted from player piano to gramophone as he became disenchanted with the  instrument's  performance  both  musically  and  economically,  but  the rolls he left behind document a time when mechanical instruments o/ffered exciting new compositional and performance options to early 20th-  century composers. 7

Stravinsky was open in his desire to remove the human performer from the bench, but the player piano was not without its flaws, and he composed his Étude around  its  weaknesses. 8   The  Pianola  Piano,  the  most  popular player piano of the time, came from the American-  based Aeolian Company, known in Britain as the Orchestrelle Company until roughly 1920. 9  When Stravinsky visited London's Aeolian Hall in 1914, the Pianola (a push-  up device) and Pianola Piano (a piano with a built-  in roll-  playing mechanism) led Britain's player piano market (Lawson 1986, 286). And operating the device was not nearly as easy as people thought. In addition to foot pedals and hand controls for tempo and sustaining, each Pianola featured one of two  possible  systems:  the  Metrostyle  or  the  Themodist.  The  Metrostyle involved red wavy lines, many of which were inaccurate and poorly done, on  the  roll  that  the  pianolist  traced  to  phrase  a  particular  performance. The Themodist allowed for the accenting of important tones in the melody by  splitting  the  keyboard  into  treble  and  bass  (the  split  occurs  between E4 and F ). A skilled pianolist could control the amount of suction given 4 to treble or bass at a given point and thus cause certain notes to sing out above the accompaniment; a poor pianolist would likely create very uneven and oddly accented performances (Lawson 1986, 286-  7). In France, the

Aeolian Company operated from the Salle Pleyel in Paris and manufactured the Pleyela and Autopleyela . The Pleyela also split between E  and F  but 4 4 it included a device called the Chanteur , which was a less-  e/ffective version of  the  Themodist.  The  Autopleyela  was  a  kind  of  simple  reproducing piano, but research thus far has not uncovered any evidence of Stravinsky's works on the Autopleyela system (Lawson 1986, 287). According to Mark McFarland, most of Stravinsky's other rolls were hand-  punched by copy editors and were not played in by the artist himself (2011, 108). Lawson claims Stravinsky's Étude uses the Metrostyle method and was inspired by his recent trip to Spain (1986, 290).

While visiting Rome in 1917, Stravinsky received a postcard from Swiss conductor  Ernest  Ansermet.  The  postcard  shows  a  small  photograph  of the  Naples  shore  surrounded  by  segments  of  handwritten  Spanish  dance music. 10 Stravinsky wanted to capture the sounds of the busy streets and Mediterranean popular music of Madrid and Naples, and Lawson describes the work as 'deliberately mechanical in sound, full of fragmented Spanish dance  tunes,  overlapping  and  competing  with  each  other  as  Stravinsky sought  to  capture  the  atmosphere  of  the  Madrid  streets,  which  he  had experienced  firsthand  during  a  visit  in  1916'  (1986,  290).  In After  the Rite , Maureen Carr uses Stravinsky's Sketchbook V to trace these melodic patterns  through  the  piece,  calling  Ansermet's  postcard  a  '  'singing  telegram' [that] could have served as a 'musical conduit' for Stravinsky's sketch of a melodic line that appears in isolation on the earliest known sketch page for the Étude ' (2014, 124). She describes the piece as looking forward and as looking back; she connects it back to the blocks and layers of his primitive works and forward to his use of the rag (2014, 123-  4).

This piece comes together in block form, a structure Stravinsky scholar Jonathan Cross defines in the following: 'each block, once defined, remains unchanged; there is no sense of a directed (linear) motion through it' (1998, 10). The Étude 's block form highlights the player piano as a machine, as a performer that can easily switch between di/fferent rhythmic and melodic ideas. 11 Nonetheless, doubling the number of notes on the same keyboard and with the promise of steady, machine-  like rhythmic accuracy, Stravinsky's Étude is a clear result of the early 20th-  century's machine-  driven culture.

The Étude pastes  together  fragments  of  Spanish  dance  music  and, inspired by busy city streets, it exhibits Stravinsky's first flirtations with a more improvisatory style. More importantly for the context of this chapter, the elements that give the piece its 'mechanical' sound-  its odd rhythms and overlapping scalar passages-  highlight the strengths of the player piano as performer. The Étude opens with high-  registered bright chords spread over three voices, and the unison rhythm and high register (D  is the lowest 4 pitch) spotlight the sparkling harmonies. The only notes in mm. 1-  6, shown in Example 4.1, are D, E, F , G , and A, and the top voice holds steadily on /uni266F /uni266F G, E, and A while the lowest voice primarily moves in neighboring parallel /uni266F

Example 4.1 travinsky's S Étude pour Pianola ,  mm. 1-  6

<!-- image -->

fifths of D-  A and E-  B. The middle voice carries the melody, which Carr calls 'chant-  like,' moving in embellished neighboring octaves motion first creating a neighbor group around G  before stuttering on the upper and lower /uni266F neighbors in turn (2014, 124). Finally, in m. 4, the middle voice breaks away from G , F , and A after E in the middle voice line stalls on F . Overall, /uni266F /uni266F /uni266F then, even the 'melody' only ranges a perfect fourth from E-  A.

Carr's connection of Stravinsky's opening melody to chant supports her claim that the piece looks back to his primitive works but the turn figure in m. 6, while also based on a neighbor motion, sounds more like something from a rag tune. Voices one and three first carry the turn figure in m.  6.  It  quickly  becomes  a  recognizable  gesture  that  will  appear  several times  throughout  the  piece,  and  its  unison  occurrence  here  (spaced  over two octaves) marks its first instance as significant. As Carr points out in her analysis, the turn figure introduced here comes from Ansermet's 1917 postcard and later shows up in Stravinsky's Sketchbook V. The turn figure has a similar neighbor-  based shape to the chanting opening melody in voice two-  F -  G -  F  as an upper neighbor figure followed by E as an incomplete /uni266F /uni266F /uni266F lower neighbor to F -  but its triplet-  based syncopation aligns it with the /uni266F contemporary rag tunes Stravinsky would soon embrace.

After this six-  measure introduction, voices four-  six join the texture, and a tutti ascending scale section plays what will become transitional material

Example 4.2 Étude pour Pianola ,  mm. 7-  10

<!-- image -->

throughout  the Étude .  Di/fferent  voices  carry  di/fferent  scales-  F  major, D  major,  and  B  major,  accompanied  by  a  chromatic  scale  beginning  on G and a non-  scalar collection of arpeggiations in the final voice. The scales move between voices, as shown by the dotted lines in Example 4.2. Voice three carries an odd collection of pitches, and it is notably the only voice that is not moving through some kind of recognizable scale; Elliot KermitCanfield describes the pitches in this voice as moving through 'octatonic arpeggiations' (2014). But looking at voice three in more detail, it initially moves through an F major triad, and after falling back to the third of the chord it  ascends  a  perfect  fourth  to  arpeggiate  through  a  B  major  triad, which then also falls to its third. F and B are a tritone apart, and by juxtaposing them against one another Stravinsky arpeggiates his Petrushka chord (1911).  After  arpeggiating  the  Petrushka  chord,  the  line  briefly  ascends through F -  G  in brief parallel fourths with the B major scale in voice five. /uni266F /uni266F B  disrupts the parallel fourths, and as the line shifts into voice three it falls /uni266F to A . A -  C-  D-  F  leads to two perfect fifth dyads, which are reminiscent of ♮ ♮ /uni266F part three in the opening of the piece, and they then lead into the cadential Es, marked by what distinctly sounds like ♭ 3 2 1    --in the top line.

These scalar transitional passages occur at several points in the Étude , and if written for a solo human pianist they would probably prove the most technically challenging. Rhythmically, the live pianist would undoubtedly

Example 4.3 Étude pour Pianola, mm. 13-  15

<!-- image -->

struggle with the complex combinations of sections like mm. 13-  15, shown in Example 4.3, which only uses four of the six possible voices. The challenge comes in the layering of a sextuplet melody (voice two) over steady eighth notes (voices three and four) and the syncopated 16th notes of voice five throughout. In m. 14 it only gets more di/fficult as the sextuplet becomes a septuplet. This section repeats in an expanded form in mm. 19-  25 after another scalar transition. It gets even more complex in its repetition, tacking on triplet quarter notes and then eighth-  note triplets in m. 22 followed by 16th-  note septuplets with alternating octave doublings, all after the original sextuplet-  septuplet-  pentuplet pattern.

Something akin to a grotesque waltz begins in m. 26 of the Étude , shown in Example 4.4, with a distorted oom-  pah-  pah rhythm in the lowest voice. This section is the most tonal-  sounding, though it is a tonality that regularly  shifts  and  changes,  both  between  voices  and  within  the  same  line. Voice  six  carries  the  limping  waltz  rhythm,  occasionally  stuttering  and getting stuck on beat one. The turn figure from the piece's opening carries through, interjecting in various lines as the melody shifts between voices.

Example 4.4 Étude pour Pianola ,  Grotesque Waltz, mm. 26-  33

<!-- image -->

For example, the melody is initially in voice three where it moves between E and F, finally climbing to A  for the turn figure. Voice one enters as voice ♭ ♭ three turns in m. 32, and voice one walks down in ornamented thirds before echoing the turn, which triggers the melody to transfer back to voice three in m. 34. The melody politely transfers between voices like partners trading bows at a formal dance. After another turn, the melody shifts back into voice one and voice two chimes in with long trills on B . These add to the ♭ ironically sentimental tone of this section-  the limping waltz, the extreme range, the folk-  like pitches of the melody that always seem just a bit o/ff. The section sounds like it is trying to be tonal, but things always go somewhat awry, when 7  is lowered 4  or is raised. At times it seems to be in E  mixo-♭ lydian, not major, though it does not ever settle into an area.

Stravinsky was not able to hear his Étude for quite a long time after its composition because it took roughly two years to produce a finished roll (Lawson 1993, 5). During June of 1919, Ansermet listened to and corrected the piece in London, but it was not publicly performed until October 1921. After Ansermet heard the piece, he wrote a letter to Stravinsky reporting that the pianola rendition was not very good (McFarland 2011, 94). What Stravinsky did not know-  what Ansermet would find out for him in a few short years-  is that while recording on the player piano may lead to mechanical perfection, that perfection comes with its own e/ffects. The noise of the instrument itself-  the rhythm of its whooshing pedals, or the cracking of the paper as it rolls over the barrel-  along with the instrument's somewhat limited dynamic controls made for a less than desirable result. Ansermet's

letter includes criticisms of the mechanical strength of the instrument, its inability  to  accent  particular  notes,  and  that  the  instrument  requires  one half of the keyboard get more emphasis than the other (the choice is up to the player piano operator) (McFarland 2011, 94). Ansermet writes, 'one feels the intervention of the performer, hence the necessity of an intelligent intermediary.' This point by itself could have convinced Stravinsky that the player piano was not all he hoped; with this line, Ansermet calls for a performer. The player piano, as a model of Frederick Winslow Taylor's 'intelligent gorilla,' discussed in Chapter 1, falls short (Taylor 1911, 40).

Ansermet  essentially  tells  Stravinsky  that  his  hope  of  removing  any interpretation  has  failed,  as  an  aural  mark  of  the  mechanism  supplants the  performer's  interpretation  of  the  work.  And  as  a  final  strike  against Stravinsky's  dream  of  a  perfect  performance,  Ansermet  criticizes  the pianola's rhythm, saying it should be 'much more rhythmic and vigorous,' citing the one musical area for which Stravinsky was known to be very particular.  Stravinsky  hoped  for  mechanical precision regarding the rhythms of his piece, but the slower passages su/ffered due to the somewhat inexact mechanics of the instrument, creating 'swung eighths' (McFarland 2011, 101). Stravinsky's goal of a purely instrumental music-  absolute music in its most reified sense-  falls short in its mechanical realization.

After  hearing  from  Ansermet  on  the  status  of  his Étude ,  Stravinsky abandoned  parts  of  his  mechanical  plans  for Les  Noces ,  which  he  had started to score immediately after selling the Étude in 1917. He had planned to score Les Noces for four pianolas, two cimbaloms, electric harmonium, and assorted percussion, but he stopped working on this version of the score in 1919. 12  He claimed the reason for this was mechanical-  it would be too di/fficult  to  align  mechanical  instruments  with  one  another  and  also  with human performers (McFarland 2011, 93). While the mechanical alignment of  multiple  player  pianos  would  have  been  di/fficult,  it  was  certainly  not impossible with the available technologies of the time, but McFarland insists that this reasoning is false and the true reason that Stravinsky abandoned the  project  was  because  of  Ansermet's  report  upon  hearing  the Étude . Stravinsky's dissatisfaction with the mechanical rendition of the piece led to his orchestration of the Étude as Madrid in  1928 and then eventually to his son Soulima Stravinsky's two-  piano transcription of Madrid in 1951 (Lawson  1993,  6).  In  other  words,  Stravinsky  reworked  the  mechanical work for human performers, and ultimately his son transcribed the original version of the work for two live pianists to play-  they abandon the machine in favor of the flawed human performer.

With the promise of steady, machine-  like rhythmic accuracy, Stravinsky's Étude reflects  the  machine-  driven culture from which it emerged. Stravinsky's son's four-  hand arrangement of the work helps preserve it as a keyboard work, available to those without player pianos. In an odd reversal akin to what Richard Taruskin calls 'time-  travel nostalgia,' a creative reimagining

of the past wherein musicians recreate, play, and perform a work that was never intended for human performer, the Étude, which never belonged to the human performer, finds new worth through human performance (Taruskin 1982, 342).

## The Player Piano's Peak

By the time the player piano peaked in the 1920s, machines and their technologies fueled western societies in the public and private spheres. People operated machines at home and at work, and historians refer to this period of great technological and mechanical change (between 1918 and 1945) as the Machine Age (Dinerstein 2003, 5). Architecture historian Reiner Banham suggests that 'the true 'ghosts in the machine' of the Twentieth Century' are the 'echoes of a far from faint-  hearted epoch when men truly tried to come to terms with 'the Machine' as a power to liberate men from ancient servitudes  to  work  and  exploitation'  (1960,  12).  Adorno  writes  about coming to terms with the machine, claiming it 'is an end in itself only under given  social  conditions-  where  men  are  appendages  of  the  machines  on which they work' (2006b, 83).

Musically, most mechanical performances provided a kind of spectacle for audiences, and the public's interest was not lost on composers of the age. Rather than emphasizing the interpretive possibilities made available by hiding or getting rid of the performer, these pieces are meant to showcase the machine; the machine has become a performer, an end result in itself. Piano companies often commissioned works for player piano; for example, the Aeolian Company commissioned Italian composer Alfredo Casella to compose his Trois  Pièces  pour  Pianola .  Interest  was  so  great  among  the composing  community  that  in  July  1926  the  Donaueschingen  chamber music festival included a concert of Originalkompositionen für mechanische Instrumente (Scheinberg  2008,  45).  The  concert  featured  works  such  as Toch's Der Jongleur arranged for Welte-  Mignon and Hindemith's Toccata für das Mechanisches Klavier .  In what follows, I examine the mechanical features of these three works-  Casella's Trois Pièces , Toch's Der Jongleur , and Hindemith's Toccataas  examples of works from the period during which the player piano's popularity peaked.

Casella was an Italian pianist and composer who studied piano first with his mother, then at the Paris Conservatory where he studied composition with Gabriel Faure. He began teaching at the Paris Conservatory in 1912 before returning to Italy to teach at the Musical Academy of St. Cecilia. He had a reputation as a leader in the Italian school of modernism (Smith and Howe 1994, 348). His Trois Pièces pour Pianola , released on rolls by the Aeolian Company of London in 1921, received their first performances under  pianolist  Reginald  Reynold  at  Aeolian  Hall.  In  a  1918  edition  of Italy's Critica musicale , G.M. Gatti writes of Cinque pezzi per pianola: 'the

writing is so complicated it can only be performed by the mechanical piano; it utilizes the full sound of the instrument to the maximum degree' (1918, 143). Indeed, the work sounds dense and complicated from its start. The 'Prélude' begins with a cluster of notes that slides up and down the keyboard in three large waves followed by an ascending three-  voice line that crashes  into  a  five-  note  low-  register  ostinato.  A  heavily  voiced  melodic section  then  begins  over  the  ostinato,  before  the  wave  pattern  returns moving from top to bottom instead of bottom to top. After another melodic section  the  'Prélude'  ends  with  an  intense  flourish  that  utilizes  most  of the keyboard in a seemingly impossible way as nearly the entire keyboard dances in a display of the machine's virtuosity. Figure 4.1 shows the roll for the lead-  in to the extremely dense texture of the 'Prélude's' concluding flourish.

The second piece, 'Valse,' begins with a basic C  major waltz accompanimental pattern and then a jagged single-  voice melodic line enters, shown in Example 4.5. The melody serves as the first half of what turns into an antecedent phrase, part of a parallel period structure. The 'Valse' includes a B section in D  major over the C pedal and ostinato harmony. ♭ The waltz accompaniment continues as expected throughout most of the 'Valse,' oscillating between C major and G dominant-  seventh harmonies, only occasionally including pre-  dominant pitches. At the movement's end the roll stalls and restarts, shown in Example 4.6. The waltz accompaniment skips a few beats and enters again and the jagged melody comes in a bar too late and the accompaniment's dropped out. The music stutters and resets as if the roll were a practicing live pianist who has had a memory slip,

or a machine winding down. The melody gives up after the fermata-  the ostinato returns and the right hand ascends through a multi-  voiced chromatic line to end the piece unconventionally, as if with a question.

After the 'Valse' comes 'Ragtime,' which begins with a flurry of trills and polyphonic ascending and descending chromatic lines  that  sound  as if  they are imitating strong gusts of wind. Then the 'rag' starts-  several voices layer at once around the main syncopated melodic line, shown in Example  4.7.  The  rag  layers  the  melody's  syncopated  swing  against  an accompaniment  reminiscent  of  stride  piano,  emphasizing  beats  one  and

<!-- image -->

Example 4.7 Ragtime' melody (transcribed by author) '

three with bass notes while beats two and four carry the harmonic accompaniment. 14  Unlike the clear singing lines of pieces like Zez Confrey's novelty rags, discussed in Chapter 1, in Casella's 'Ragtime' it is di/fficult to tell exactly which is the accompaniment and which the melody; with so many notes at one time, only occasional melodic snippets pop out of the thick texture. The middle section is even more clearly written in the stride style, and one simple, descending melody in F major sings through in the upper voice over a relatively simple waltz accompaniment. The sparse passage does not last long, though, as soon more voices layer in until the texture is as thick as it was in the first section, which eventually returns after the F major melody repeats, gradually moving into the lower register of the piano. The opening wind gusts and melody return and the work ends with an ascending chromatic flurry and octave low-  register Cs.

Casella's Trois Pièces pour Pianola 's texture is much denser than that of a typical solo piano work, and the piece is as showy visually as it is aurally. The thick, clustered harmonies spread across the keyboard seem impossible to ears accustomed to traditional piano works, and the keyboard with so many notes pressed at once looks a bit like a magic trick. Casella's work is virtuosic throughout and would be highly demanding on the live pianist. Moreover, with so many notes happening simultaneously, the work would likely need to be arranged for at least two pianos to achieve the same e/ffect. Casella's Trois Pièces highlights the mechanism by taking advantage of the unlimited number of notes it can play and its mechanistic exactitude in executing complex rhythms. The work has a 'mechanical' sound insofar as the sheer volume of notes is impossible for a solo pianist. Beyond that, the work bears few markings of the 'machine' in the industrial sense, lacking any kind of whirring or clanking.

Ernst Toch was a Viennese composer and pianist who, throughout the 1920s, served as director for the Mannheim Conservatory (Pisk and Marble 1938, 439-  40). He composed for mechanical instruments as one would for any other instrument, explaining, 'the music that is in question here is not any music reproduced by a mechanical instrument, but it is music for a mechanical instrument, just as there is music for 'violin and piano' or music 'for orchestra'  ' (König 1977, 37). Toch, then, lacks the fervor of a composer such as George Antheil, who composed music specifically for machines and proclaimed to have discovered a 'new FOURTH DIMENSION of music' (Antheil 1925, 791).

Toch was not drawn to the player piano because of its unlimited technical  ability,  but  rather  as  its  own  instrument  that  happened,  also,  to play without need for a human performer. Indeed, Scheinberg writes that Toch 'maintained a less revolutionary stance, welcoming the innovations of mechanical music but defending the value of music composed for live instrumentalists' (2008, 45-  6). Toch's work premiered almost ten years after Stravinsky's composition of the Étude . His Welte-  Mignon (a player piano company) arrangement of Der Jongleur , the third of his three Burlesken für Klavier , was played at the Donaueschingen concert and in comparing the roll performance with the score for live pianists it is not overly di/fferent.

Writing  in  1929,  K.  Laux  describes  Toch's Der Jongleur as  a  'capital piece'  that  Toch  placed  'unaltered  on  the  roll  of  the  mechanical  piano thereby proving himself e/ffective both materially and motively' (1929, 27). While Laux claims that the roll follows the score, in looking at the score and listening to the roll and watching the piano keyboard move, this is in fact not the case. The roll includes octave doublings at times, and embellishes certain passages with ornamental chromaticism. Overall, though, the most mechanically impressive part of listening to the roll of Toch's Der Jongleur is the sheer rhythmic relentlessness of the machine. Indeed, the work is a barrage of almost constant eighth or 16th notes. While there is very little syncopation in Der Jongleur ,  compared with Casella's 'Ragtime' or Stravinsky's Étude , it sounds impressive because of its rhythmic invariance.

Hindemith was a German violinist, composer, and theorist who, during the First World War, played in a string quartet intended to provide relief for  o/fficers.  Following  the  war  Hindemith  resumed  his  position  as  concertmaster of the Frankfurt Opera until he resigned in 1923 after successfully  negotiating  a  monthly  salary  with  publisher  Schott  and  Sons  as  a composer. 15  Andrew Fraser writes of Hindemith leading a group of young polyphonists in Germany and claims Hindemith's turn toward the mechanical is unsurprising in light of the performance indications on his Suite for Piano, op. 26, entitled 1922 . Hindemith tells performers to 'play this piece wildly, but always in very strict time, like a machine. Consider the piano here as an interesting kind of instrument of percussion' (1929, 170). Fraser  then  concludes,  'Hindemith,  later,  carries  it  to  its  logical  conclusion by dispensing with the variable personal equation of the performer and composing directly for the mechanistic pianola' (1929, 171). Hindemith's Toccata für Mechanisches Klavier begins loudly-  in Lawson's 1996 transcription of the work, the descending lower two voices move in a wedge against the ascending upper voices, all carrying some combination of fully or half-  diminished seventh chords with minor ninths (Lawson 1996, 1928). The opening is dense, and at times the four voices play up to 12 pitches at once, as shown in Example 4.8. In addition, the voices take advantage of the keyboard's range-  for example, take note of the octave clef di/fferences between lines one and four. Although rhythmically challenging because of

Example 4.8 Dense  harmonies  in four-  voice texture of Lawson's transcription of Hindemith, mm. 1-  2

<!-- image -->

its  use  of  triplets,  septuplets,  and  meter  shifts  between  simple  quadruple and simple triple, the work is not overly complex rhythmically. Triplets and septuplets usually occur in all voices rather than creating any kind of syncopation or metric dissonance between the voices.

Each of these examples of music for player piano represents a di/fferent facet of the performing machine in the 1920s. Casella's Trois Pièces pour Pianola and Hindemith's Toccata für Mechanisches Klavier each take advantage  of  the  player  piano's  unlimited  access  to  the  keyboard-  unlike  the pianist's ten fingers, the player piano mechanism can hit dozens of keys at a time, providing composers with a dense harmonic palette. Toch was subtler in his arrangement of Der Jongleur for player piano-  through simple octave doublings and enhanced ornamental passages Toch embellishes his work to take better advantage of the mechanical player. In each example given in

this section, the machine itself is the performer; the machine is the technical novelty and the performer.

These examples from the peak of the player piano's popularity demonstrate a unique take on how composers can use the player piano. Through the player piano, Casella put on an aural and visual spectacle, with wave patterns built into the roll and into the shape of the line and impressively thick doublings and harmonic settings. Casella used the player piano as a technical marvel and he layered familiar musical tropes such as waltz or ragtime to create a musical hybrid, a mechanical depiction of traditional musical styles. Toch treated mechanical instruments as just another instrument, one without a live player. Toch's perspective on the mechanical instrument, then, is  perhaps  not  of  an  instrumental  performance  free  from  mediation,  but instead with a di/fferent kind of mediation. But for Hindemith, the player piano allowed a high degree of control that brings to mind the philosophy of absolute music; Mark Katz writes that for Hindemith 'the advantages of mechanical music included 'the possibility to define absolutely the will of the  composer'  and  the  'extension  of  technical  and  timbral  possibilities'  ' (Katz 2004, 121). 16  Hindemith's approach to the player piano realizes the ideal for absolute music set forth by Hanslick: for Hindemith, the player piano allowed for the transmission of his musical material as he intended it to be played.

## Outmoded Mechanics: The Player Piano After its Peak

By the 1940s the player piano had, for the most part, passed its prime, having been stifled by the Depression on the one hand and the growing popularity of radio, electrical recording, and the talkies on the other (Parakilas 1999, 74). Suisman writes that 'beyond the 1920s, the significance of the playerpiano  has  been  di/fficult  to  perceive,'  that  the  market  takeover  by  radio and phonograph coupled with the stock market crash and Great Depression essentially buried the player piano so well that its ending seems historically irrelevant (2010, 25). Thus, by the time Nancarrow was composing, the player piano's moment at the cutting edge of musical technology had passed. The instrument and its familiar mechanical ringing gained a sentimental patina. Yet the nostalgic appeal of the instrument was not its only appealing feature-  through Nancarrow's works the player piano continued as a compositional tool after the instrument's fall in the popular market.

Nancarrow turned to the player piano because he lived in Mexico City, a place of 'extreme musical isolation' (Carlson 1988, 2). Moreover, he needed a way to play his music and the player piano o/ffered a convenient means of bypassing performers, whom he dreamed to 'get rid of' (Amirkhanian 1977, 15). He punched his rolls by hand using a personalized roll-  punching machine he had made in New York, and he played his pieces on one of his  two  player  pianos  that  he  altered,  also  by  hand  (Carlson  1988,  4).

Nancarrow's  music  relies  heavily  on  complex  and  perfectly  measured rhythms, something well suited to a mechanical performer (when properly operated), and it reportedly took him several months to draw and punch a two- to three-  minute work (Commanday 1981, 41). Philip Carlson claims, 'no one before Nancarrow had systematically used the [player piano] to explore  rhythm' (1988, 3). And a reviewer for The Boston Globe went so  far  as  to  describe  Nancarrow's  music  as  'filled  with  the  exuberance and sheer relish of a sonic scientist running wild in his private laboratory' (Eichler 2007). His pieces were not popular at the time of their composition-  indeed, his works were not well known until the late 1960s when Columbia released  an  album  of  them.  Furthermore,  it  was  not  until  the 1970s and 1980s, relatively late in his life, that he gained any kind of real recognition in the classical music community.

Nancarrow was aware that he was composing for an outmoded technology. Indeed, in an interview he called the player piano an 'old-  fashioned, out-  of-  date  thing' that he 'just got hung up on' (Rockwell 1981, 3). In composing for player piano Nancarrow's work is philosophically similar to electronic music, such as Halim El-  Dabh's work for magnetic tape or Pierre Schae/ffer's musique concrète compositions, but rather than working with new technologies and their modern or even non-  musical sounds, Nancarrow worked with quaint but accessible technology. He said, 'Frankly, I think the future is electronic,' but that he used the player piano because it was available to him in Mexico City (Rockwell 1981, 3). And Nancarrow felt 'constrained by players' limitations' but 'with the player piano [he] just did what [he] wanted to do' (Rockwell 1981, 3). Thus, Nancarrow turned to the player piano because it was available, and because it allowed him to bypass the performer, who would struggle not only with the rhythmic demands of his music but also the technical ones.

Tempo was always of the utmost importance to Nancarrow. When interviewer Cole Gagne asked him to elaborate on this he said, 'A sort of subdivision of tempo is rhythm and combinations of rhythm; polyrhythms or whatever. The other things, harmony and melody, I use only as a crutch for tempo or rhythm, that's all' (Gagne and Caras 1982, 301). Nancarrow's Study No. 2 begins with ostinati, setting the background for the metric complexity that will drive the rest of the piece. The lower ostinato begins in 5/  8 and ascends through a pattern of F-  G-  B -  D adding one eighth rest after ♭ every three notes, essentially upsetting the four-  note pattern so that it does not fall the same way in each measure. This pattern is set against a second ostinato in 3/  4 that moves in an even pattern between A  and D  eighth notes ♭ ♭ each divided by an eighth rest. The pitches used in these two ostinati combine to form a blues scale, with a lowered seventh and major/  minor ambiguity around the third (D/D ) (Gann 1995, 73). The ostinato falls naturally ♭ into a 2/  4 pattern, but by shifting this pattern into 3/  4, Nancarrow adjusts where the downbeat falls and thus prevents any of the beats from being too

strong in this pattern. Nancarrow likes to be in control of where accents will occur, occasionally going to great lengths to avoid having any kind of convergence between lines. 17

As James Tenney, Margaret Elida Thomas, and Kyle Gann mention in their work, Nancarrow often used ratios to determine tempo and time signature for a given passage, and as shown in the previous example, he may overlap di/fferent time signatures at the same time in order to achieve a particular mathematical or rhythmic e/ffect. The mechanical piano allowed him to create these complex passages. While sometimes he explicitly indicates his ratios (for example, Study No. 24 , which is subtitled 'Canon 14/  15/  16'), he just as often does not. In Study No. 2 , scholars describe the tempo ratios di/fferently. For example, Thomas highlights the ratios between tempi that she works out into 3/  4/  5/  6, Tenney and Gann work out the tempo ratios as 10/  12/  15/  20 (which is a reduction of 57.5/  69/  86.25/  115), and Margaret Elida Thomas' ratios for the work are not as direct, as she derives them from individual comparisons at each occurrence. 18

Looking more closely at the entrance of the melody in m. 17, the ostinati shift in the accompanying voices. Tenney describes this shift as a move to IV, and both Tenney and Gann assert that the entire study follows a I-  IVI-  V-  I harmonic pattern that is typical of the blues (Tenney 1977, 47). It is not a coincidence that m. 17 is where the melody enters: roughly every 16 measures the two original ostinati align, and these moments of alignment also mark the harmonic shifts between I-  IV-  I-  V and I. The combination of di/fferent time signatures and tempo designations leads to the creation of what is called temporal dissonance . This is Nancarrow's term for the relationship between the lines-  the level of temporal dissonance is correlative to how often lines converge. Fewer convergences create a higher level of temporal  dissonance.  Eric  Drott  summarizes:  'Tempo  relations  that  feature a high number of such simultaneities are relatively dissonant. Or, the greater  the  duration  separating  one  such  simultaneity  from  the  next,  the greater the degree of temporal dissonance' (2004, 539). In Study No. 2 , these alignments always lead to some kind of change in the melody, whether it is the introduction of a new voice or a tempo change in an already-  present line. When the second melodic voice enters in m. 29 it centers the melody around E  while the original line shifts to B . The melody appears bitonally ♭ ♭ several times as the piece progresses, but it is notable here that the two areas the melody focuses on are tonic and subdominant, supporting the claim that this section is in IV.

Soon  after  the  canonic  entrance  of  the  second  melodic  voice,  the  two bass ostinati converge once again, and the harmony shifts back to I. This shift knocks the lower melodic voice into a statement on B  while the top ♭ voice enters with a hint of the melody on F, foreshadowing the next move to V. The voice shifts back to E  as the top moves to B , and at the end of m. 42 ♭ ♭ the two melodic voices switch lines. Both melodic voices come in with the

melody in F as the music adds a third melodic line and the ostinati switch to V. Once V is established, there is another instance of bitonality (roughly in m. 51) when the outer melodic voices (lines one and three) carry the melody in F while the inner voice (line two) sings through in B . The texture thins as ♭ the piece moves towards its close-  the lower two melodic voices drop out and the top voice carries the melody in B . Voice one hammers out the line in ♭ octaves, and when voice two enters a few measures later, it too is in B . Voice ♭ two briefly tonicizes V, echoed by voice one, before both return to tonic. Voice two drops out four measures from the end and voice one finishes the melody on a held B , bringing the piece to a close. ♭

Study No. 2 is a combination of two ostinati and up to three canonic layers in the melody. The ostinati establishes the I-  IV-  I-  V-  I harmonic motion in B, a key established by the pitch collection of the opening ostinati. Ratios ♭ come into play for the tempo relations, and the melody appears at various tempi: 57.25, 69, 86.25, and 115. The melody also tonicizes I, IV, and V depending on the location in the piece. Nancarrow employs bitonality when he layers the canonic occurrences of the melody in I and IV or I and V simultaneously. The ostinati control the content of the piece, and the melodic key areas come from the harmonic motion of the ostinati. The piece is a basic layering of ostinati and canonic melody, which is broken down into a  grouping  of  two  against  1,  2,  or  3,  creating  a  dissonance  even  on  the most background level. Tonally, Nancarrow's work is more easily organized than Stravinsky's block form. The opening ostinati can be grouped by pitch collection into the B  blues scale, the melody is easily hearable, and each ♭ occurrence falls clearly into I, IV , or V . There are very few melodic exceptions from these categories (for example, the melody does briefly highlight C, or V/  V), and even these are explainable in tonal terms.

Study No. 2 is an early work for Nancarrow, and his pieces only get more complex with time. After Study No. 20 , Nancarrow 'changed the punching machine.  It  wasn't  necessary  to  use  the  evenly  spaced  notches  anymore. You could adjust it to punch in any place. So the only limitation was on the spacing of repeated notes …' (Reynolds 1984, 20). The changes in his punching machine led to a change in the complexity of Nancarrow's work. As Drott writes, his earlier works are 'lacking in nuance at the most immediate rhythmic level … The presence of a relatively simple underlying grid in the early studies imposed a rigid, artificial order on the rhythmic flow' (2004, 558). After he had his punching device altered, however, it opened his music up to more rhythmic possibilities. The changes in the mechanics transformed  the  'player  piano's  distinctly  mechanical  rhythm'  that  was so  present  in  his  earlier  studies  'into  a  more  unpredictable,  irrational, and almost 'natural' rhythm' (2004, 559). Nancarrow was obsessed with rhythmic exactitude and was willing to sacrifice the performer's role to get it; he felt so strongly about how his music should sound that he controlled every nuance, down to the very instrument upon which his pieces were to

be played. His extreme control over the musical result supports the idea that what Nancarrow was working towards was absolute music-  an exact performance according to his specifications, the music as it is meant to be played according to the composer. His layering of complex rhythms and tempi along with ratio-  based metric shifts put the exact execution of the work above musical interpretation-  rhythm was the most important, and the performer's interpretational influence would only blemish the ultimate performance.

## Conclusion

As evidenced through Nancarrow's compositions, the player piano did not completely disappear after its sales declined in the 1920s; in fact, the player piano was rediscovered in 1950s American markets (Ord-  Hume 1970, 42). Arthur W.J.G. Ord-  Hume calls the renewed interest in the player piano 'an example of yet another demonstration of the latent rebelling by the ordinary person against  the  electronic  age'  (1970,  43).  But  upon  its  re-  entry,  the player piano was a niche instrument, of interest to only a select portion of the market. It never returned to its previous levels of popularity, and to this day remains on the sidelines of the market.

The  player  piano  promises  absolute  music  to  its  listener-  an  absolute music that despite its theoretical and philosophical definition by Hanslick, Dahlhaus,  and  Nattiez  remains  elusive  even  in  its  mechanical  execution. Taruskin, in an article responding to a critic telling him to 'let the music speak  for  itself,'  writes  that  this  is  a  curious  request  of  the  performer, claiming, 'if a performer did not have the urge to participate in it and, yes, to contribute to it, why then he wouldn't have become a performer in the first place' (1982, 339). He criticizes composers for their desire to eliminate the performer, and calls out Stravinsky in particular for his simply becoming a performer himself rather than trusting any interpretational decisions to another player (1982, 339). Taruskin claims 'music can never under any circumstances but electronic speak for itself … [it is] impossible to realize absolutely' (1982, 340). Yet absolute music was the goal for many piano roll performances, not just for Stravinsky with his Étude , and the struggle to capture, store, and recreate absolute music pulls in the tangled writings on musical authenticity, a subject for another project.

The modern or 'Stravinskian' aesthetic involves an erasure or the complete displacement of the performer in the playing of a work as if the performer's interpretation were automatically a culturally invalid, distracting intrusion into the work's aural space. The idea, then, is that a piano roll performance, even one that was first played onto the roll and then edited and perfected, stores the only performance of the work; no live pianist need play the Étude because the roll always already stores the work. By playing the roll listeners come to believe they have access to absolute music, to the work itself. But

this is complicated. The piano roll fails when the sounds of the mechanism interfere  with  a  performance.  Because  music  cannot  speak  for  itself,  i.e., without some kind of mediating performer whether human or mechanical. Taruskin  goes  on  to  challenge  performers  to  have  their  own  intentions, intentions that are valid and authentic to the performance and to the work (1982, 343). The player piano's stored performances-  perfect performances that never came to pass on the instrument itself-  were supposed to capture, store, and recreate more than music; the roll was to capture time so that each playing issued a performance complete in itself. But maybe the idea of the roll was so appealing because, in addition to time, they appeared to store a piece of the performer or composer. Player piano rolls o/ffered a kind of immortality, an immortality some would later hope to find in digitally recorded music. But the player piano was the earliest indication of this kind of  musical  preservation.  Through  piano  rolls  composers  and  performers immortalized a piece of their spirit through their work-  through a piano roll, a musician becomes the ghost in the machine.

## Notes

- 1  I  say  theoretically  because  a  mechanical  performance  contains  its  own  aural markings, such as the whirring of the mechanism or whooshing of the rolls.
- 2  Dahlhaus cites an 1895 essay by Jules Combarieu. Ironically, Wagner acted as one of the main challengers to the concept of absolute music (1995, 3).
- 3  Hanslick  inveighs  against  'feeling-  theory'  (what  theorist  Leonard  B.  Meyer [1956, 3] calls 'expressionist') in favor of a formalist model of musical meaning. Agreeing with Hanslick, Meyer writes 'the meaning of music lies in the perception and understanding of the musical relationships set forth in the work of art and that meaning in music is primarily intellectual.' Expressionists, on the other hand, 'would argue that these same relationships are in some sense capable of exciting feelings and emotions in the listener' (1986, 29).
- 4  Interpretant  is  a  Piercian  term  Nattiez  uses  to  describe  what  the  performer chooses to emphasize or de-  emphasize in a given performance. These choices then influence the listener's interpretation of the work.
- 5  Rex Lawson claims George Gershwin and Igor Stravinsky's music rolls were in fact handmade transcriptions of their performances, rather than rolls recorded while the artist played (Lawson 2006, 356).
- 6  Once he signed the contract with Pleyel, Stravinsky lived in the piano factory and was given his own workshop. This was a highly lucrative contract for the composer-  according to Robert Craft, Stravinsky's contract with Pleyel was probably worth between $2,000 and $4,000 annually at a time where the average worker's income was closer to $600 (Craft 2011).
- 7  With  the  stock  market  crash  of  1929,  many  of  the  Duo-  Art  arrangements were lost.
- 8  Stravinsky primarily interacted with player pianos in the British, French, and American tradition, rather than the German Welte-  Mignon. Though the WelteMignon operates by perforated music roll, it does not require the foot pedaling

- of early player pianos and is usually a keyboard-  less instrument more similar to a sideboard than silent piano (Lawson 1986, 284).
- 9  The Aeolian Company first marketed the Pianola in 1897, and it was a pushup device with felt-  covered wooden fingers that played the keys of an ordinary piano. It was not until roughly 1902 that pianos were manufactured with a builtin roll-  playing mechanism. The built-  in devices were known as player pianos, but the Aeolian Company called theirs pianola pianos (Lawson 1986, 284).

- 2  After  attending  a  performance  of  three  Stravinsky  Ballets,  Eric  Walter  White 1 recounts, 'I was particularly thrilled by The Wedding , although I had to admit that the e/ffect of the two Pleyel double-  pianos on the stage with their shabby cases like co/ffins, was not altogether satisfactory from the point of view of the stage spectacle' (1967, 33).

- 4  Stride as a piano style developed in Harlem in the 1910s and was known for its 1 virtuosic demands-  it took the syncopated rhythms of ragtime at much faster tempos. J. Bradford Robinson claims the style earned its name when pianists like Fats Waller and James P. Johnson included a 'stride bass' left-  hand pattern in their playing, often using intervals of a tenth or more instead of the normal octave doubling in the bassline (Berlin 2013; Robinson 2001).
- 5  Eventually, Hindemith emigrated to the United States and, after a time, became 1 professor of music theory at Yale University, before returning to Europe as professor of musicology at the University of Zurich (Kangas 2009, 625).
- 6  Katz  quotes  Hindemith  here,  citing  'Möglichkeit  der  absoluten  Festlegung 1 des Willens des Komponisten … Erweiterung der technischen und klanglichen Möglichkeiten'  (Paul  Hindemith,  'Zur  mechanischen  Musik,' Musikanten Gilde 5 [November 15, 1927]: 156) (2004, 121).
- 7  In her dissertation, Margaret Elida Thomas discusses this study and she creates 1 a figure that actually aligns these ostinati in 2/  4. She calls 2/  4 'the meter that the two components gesturally imply.' She includes examples to prove that 'two of the four simultaneous articulations of the excerpt that appear to be metrically significant in Example 4-  4(a) are perceptually not very significant after all, as represented by the thin vertical lines in 4-  4(b), since they do not coincide with mutual perceptual downbeats.' Ultimately, she concludes that the ostinato is much more dissonant than it appears (1996, 101-  02).
- 8  Regarding Gann and Tenney's ratios, the opening tempo indication is 69:115, 1 which works out to a ratio of 3:5. This ties into the time signature indications of 3/  4 and 5/  8. When the third voice enters in m. 17 (my measure numbers are based on the bar lines of the two already-  established ostinati), it enters in 2/  4 with the tempo indication of 86.25. The tempo ratios for 69/  86.25/  115 work out to 3/  4/  5. The fourth voice enters in m. 29 and it is in 6/  16 with the tempo of 115the same metronomic speed as the lowest voice, but with di/fferent subdivisions. 5/  8 is an odd meter, and here it follows the basic eighth-  note pulse for its beat

level,  while 6/  16  is  compound duple and divides each measure in half. When another new voice enters on page five of the score, it is in 6/  8 or simple duple with the tempo indication of 57.5. The comparison of 57.5/  69/  86.25/  115 works out to 10/  12/  15/  20,  which is how Gann and Tenney arrive at their analytical ratios. Regarding Margaret Elida Thomas' ratios, the opening ratio of 69:115 is 3:5.4 derives from comparing 69:86.25 resulting in the ratio 4:5 or from comparing 86.25:115 resulting in the ratio 3:4. To get 6, she compares 57.5:69 to get 5:6, and she stacks each of these individual results to conclude that the piece is based on the ratios 3/  4/  5/  6. Even though all four tempos occur together, she does not compare them with one another in order to arrive at 10/  12/  15/  20 as the ultimate compositional ratio. Instead, she compares them in smaller chunks, and thus deals with smaller ratios. The ratio 3/  4/  5/  6 can come out of a fractional comparison of the time signatures, which would perhaps lend some more support  to  Thomas'  ratio  conclusions.  The  opening  ratio  of  3:5  comes  from comparing the tempos, but if we look just at 3/  4 as compared with 5/  8, we get the common denominator of 8 and then land on the ratio of 6:5. The next tempo is 2/  4, and 2/  4:3/  4:5/  8 works out to 4/  5/  6. When 6/  16 enters, it reduces to 3/  8, and the ratio becomes 3/  4/  5/  6 (1996, 103-  04).

## The Machine Age in Ruins

## Introduction

This book only scratches the surface of the ways in which industrialized labor practices influenced music and sound during and after the Machine Age. The player piano both foreshadows and launches the turn toward the digital; the problems of the player piano are entrenched in western musical culture. Indeed, it is during the 1910s and 1920s that musical machinesbeyond acoustic instruments as machines-  became normalized in people's domestic  and  professional  lives.  This  normalization  has  continued  and expanded as machines and technology have become ubiquitous in modern life. The issues the instrument presents linger in our current preoccupations with technology. The Machine Age haunts us still.

As a means of conclusion, I will connect the player piano to the present day in several ways. First, I will return to George Antheil's Ballet Mécanique , discussed in Chapter 1, and Conlon Nancarrow's Study No. 2 , discussed in Chapter 4. Each of these pieces were restaged in a new way-  one through further mechanical mediation, the other through humanization. Antheil's reworking of Ballet Mécanique is his way of responding to the ruins of the Machine Age; Nancarrow, on the other hand, tinkers with the player piano as an obsolete technology. Second, I discuss examples of edited lyric rolls for player piano as a kind of early domestic entertainment, which I connect to the modern use of Auto-  Tune in popular music. In this section, I also discuss the Disklavier, sequencers, and MIDI as new forms of self-  playing machine. Third, I analyze three films: Hugo and Edward Scissorhands for their use of music that is meant to imitate or score the machine, and Touch of Evil for its presentation of the player piano as an obsolete technology.

## Out of the Ashes: Ballet Mécanique and Study No. 2

George Antheil's Ballet  Mécanique -  written  specifically  for  machines-  is unique in its  own  time.  The  piece  falls  into  a  category  with  later  player piano  works  by  Conlon  Nancarrow  and  works  of  electronic  music  that

can only be (or are intended to be) performed through modern mechanical means. Electronic music, including the mid-  century works for magnetic tape and later works for synthesizer and computer by composers such as Pierre Schae/ffer ( Étude aux chemins de fer , 1948), Karlheinz Stockhausen ( Gesang  der  Jünglinge ,  1955-  56),  and  Milton  Babbit  ( Philomel ,  1964), among others, falls into the same category of mechanical music as Antheil's Ballet  Mécanique and  Nancarrow's  works  for  player  piano  because  they forefront the machine; they are examples of music written for and played by machines. In each of these cases, the labor falls onto the composer, technology, and in some cases a group of performers. For example, Schae/ffer's Étude aux chemins de fer relies upon his tape-  looping of railway sounds, Stockhausen's Gesang der Jünglinge blends the human voice with electronically generated sounds he created, and Babbit's Philomel relies upon a singer interacting with her own recorded voice, projected from o/ff stage.

Antheil's Ballet Mécanique has an odd history of composition and recomposition, one that is worth revisiting more substantially. His 1926 Ballet 's original scoring calls for three xylophones, electric bells, three propellers, tam-  tam,  four  drums,  a  siren,  two  pianos,  and  16  pianolas  written  in four parts (Antheil 2003). When Antheil adapted his Ballet to the 1950s market he removed the player pianos completely, reorchestrating the work for four pianos, four xylophones, two electric bells, two propellers, timpani,  glockenspiel,  and  other  percussion  instruments,  and  he  shortened the work, cutting its runtime from roughly 23 minutes to 18 (Whitesitt 1983, 107). The score for Ballet Mécanique most commonly encountered today is the updated version, not the original score from 1926, and most scholarly articles refer to the 1952 score rather than the original. When Antheil  reworked  his Ballet  Mécanique he  divested  it  of  its  own  modernity, of its own time, in favor of using instruments that were familiar to the institutional tradition of the 18th- and 19th-  century concert hall. He disassembled his work only to put it together in such a way as to fit it into the classical institution, perhaps to immortalize himself in his more easily performable work.

Conlon Nancarrow's player piano compositions do the opposite, taking what  was  once  cutting-  edge  technology,  the  player  piano,  and  using  it as  a  simple  tool  to  aid  in  his  composition.  It  is  as  if  he  is  playing  amid the  ruins  of  the  Machine  Age.  But  perhaps  composing  for  player  piano in the 1940s was not as out of date as Nancarrow thought; Nancarrow's compositions for player piano prove equally modern as those written for electronic  instruments.  Thus,  it  was  somewhat  alarming,  pun  intended, when  the  modern  chamber  orchestra  Alarm  Will  Sound  included  a  live version of Nancarrow's Study No. 2 on  their  2005  album, Acoustica .  In reworking Nancarrow's Study for live musicians, Alarm Will Sound cancels the machine part of the equation; the compositional tool is left behind as part of the creative process rather than a part of the performing result.

On Acoustica ,  Alarm Will Sound recreates electronic works for an allacoustic ensemble. The album includes Nancarrow's Study No. 2 , a work for player piano, relying on click tracks in order to correctly play the piece's mathematically exact rhythms and metric ratios. While it is not unique in Alarm Will Sound's oeuvre, this is an odd circumstance in that the music exists first as mechanical and second as human. At a concert, one of the group's founders, Alan Pierson, told the audience, 'We're taking music that wasn't supposed to be played by humans. We've figured out the sounds and now we'll make them live' (quoted in Wilson 2007).

Alarm Will Sound's adaptation of mechanical works for live performers is  a  kind  of  'random  cannibalization'  of  the  work  (Jameson  2003,  18). The  group  de-  mechanizes  the  mechanical,  inserting  elements  of  human musical labor made irrelevant by musical machines. In so doing, Alarm Will Sound humanizes the musical topic of the mechanical, or perhaps creates its opposite in a musical topic of the a-  mechanical, of the human. The contemporary ensemble is like a human machine, interpreting the musical data and imitating the machines upon which the music was originally played in a postmodern sampling of the three kinds of mechanical music presented in Chapter 1. The constant driving rhythms, emphasis on woodwinds and percussion, and awkward or odd accentuations that come to mark the musical topic of the mechanical in the earlier examples have become the norm, and it is in adding human elements that the music becomes cutting edge once more. In taking mechanical music and humanizing it, Alarm Will Sound is a kind of performance-  generating machine, churning out humanized machine music.  Rather  than  flocking  to  see  a  machine  imitate  a  human  virtuoso, Alarm Will Sound presents humans imitating the mechanical virtuoso. The group's 20 players are the new novelty, the mechanical spectacle for a time in which machines are ubiquitous and highly skilled musical labor is unique. In a Boston Globe

review of one of Alarm Will Sound's performances of Nancarrow's Study No. 2 , the reviewer writes,

Nancarrow's Studies for Player Piano (recorded on the Wergo label) are commonly thought of as unfit for flesh-  and-  blood musicians, but this is not strictly true … In distributing the often bluesy pile-  ups of mechanical plinks to various combinations of woodwinds strings, percussion, and piano, these arrangements naturally lose something of the maniacal speed and precision of the originals-  though not as much as you might think with these players.

(Eichler 2007)

Gavin Chuck's arrangement of Nancarrow's Study No. 2 for the Alarm Will Sound 20-  piece chamber ensemble begins with a clear swing that contrasts with  the  opening  of  the  piano  roll  with  its  strict  timing  and  rhythmically exact entrances. Alarm Will Sound's string bass emphasizes the blues

influence on the work while in the player piano version the blues influence comes through in the melody with its blues-  scale pitches and syncopated rhythms. The snare drum hits on what sounds like the second beat of each measure along with the steady high-  hat, and later melodies on the trombone (including a slide e/ffect of which the player piano would be incapable), trumpet, and clarinet all give the work a sense of authenticity as a jazz work while the player piano version sounds more like a mechanized version of a jazz work. Indeed, in putting the two works next to one another, one might assume that the chamber ensemble version came first. That is not to say that the Alarm Will Sound version lacks the rhythmic and metrical complexity, or the extreme dissonances, of the original. But rather than an exercise in machine-  like precision and pushing the limits in metrical layerings, Chuck's  arrangement  sounds  more  like  someone  wrote  something  fairly simple and applied odd meter shifts to ensure the parts would only align at certain points. That makes the points when the ensemble does seem to come together-  such as roughly two-  thirds in when, after a period where it feels like all voices are slowing down at di/fferent speeds, the tempo picks up for a few seconds instead-  seem intentional rather than accidental. 1

Due  to  the  dissonances  and  meter  changes  the  work  sounds  like  the ensemble is failing to listen to one another or to follow the conductor, but the passages where all the parts align serve as a reminder that each voice is  indeed  where  it  needs  to  be.  With  so  many  voices  in  di/fferent  meters it would be interesting to learn exactly which part the conductor leads at various points throughout the performance. In Alarm Will Sound's 2009 performance at the Moscow Art Festival the conductor shifts meters regularly, sometimes leading the percussion, other times falling into the meter of the woodwinds or strings.

Alarm Will Sound's postmodern idea of taking a work and using it in a way it was never intended to be used, as a commodity to be consumed and altered at will,  contrasts with Nancarrow's modernist view that emphasized 2 the intellectual, through his mathematical ratios, complex meters, and faith in technology rather than human performers. 3  David Harvey describes modernist art as art for art's sake-  like music for music's sake in the Chapter 4 discussion of absolute music-  and he claimed that modernist art was often 'a  highly  individualistic,  aristocratic,  disdainful  (particularly  of  popular culture), and even arrogant perspective on the part of cultural producers' (Harvey 1990, 22). Nancarrow's use of the player piano as the ideal performer rather than the flawed human player, his musical isolation in Mexico City, and his assumption that live players would not be able to play his complex rhythms indicate a modernist mindset.

Alarm Will Sound's adaptation of Nancarrow's work for live performers indicates an indi/fference to the work's original meaning (Jameson 2003, 18). Unlike Stravinsky and Antheil, Nancarrow did not arrange his own player piano work for other instruments; the player piano was already obsolete

when he decided to compose for it. While Stravinsky and Antheil tried to stay on the cutting edge of musical technology with their player piano works, Nancarrow made a conscious choice to use the outmoded technology.

Alarm Will Sound's live version of Nancarrow's Study No. 2 does  not revive the work-  it never had a live player to begin with-  but rather it demechanizes the mechanical, reinserting elements of human labor previously made irrelevant by the player piano. Chuck's arrangement of Nancarrow's work does not revive the player piano. Instead, the arrangement extracts the musical data from the piano roll and feeds it into a human machine, the contemporary ensemble, and thereby creates an additional level of abstraction. Alarm Will Sound's human performance of Nancarrow's Study No. 2 , a work intended for the mechanical performer, transitions the work from music written specifically for mechanical performance to music that imitates the  machine, but instead of imitating the stomping pistons and cranking gears of the industrial machine Alarm Will Sound imitates the player piano. In taking mechanical music and humanizing it, Alarm Will Sound makes a  critical  statement  about  the  contemporary  performance  ensemble.  The ensemble is a kind of performance-  generating machine, impressing audiences with their machine-  like rhythmic exactitude and churning out humanized machine music. Eichler writes that 'Musicians do not typically strive to play like machines,' but that is just what Alarm Will Sound does in their performance of Nancarrow's Study (2007). Instead of mechanical instruments mimicking  the  human  performer-  as  in  the  piano  roll  performances  by Confrey, Rachmanino/ff, Debussy, and others-  human performers imitate the mechanical instrument. 20 players take on the task previously covered by one mechanical piano; humans imitate the machine. The obsolete player piano  meets  its  match  in  the  equally  obsolete  contemporary  performing ensemble that asserts its musical and artistic relevance above the technological noise of the 21st century.

## The Ghost in the Machine

In the early 20th century, the player piano presented a new opportunity for accompaniment for professional singers, films, and background music for public places, such as bars and roller rinks. One less-  discussed but novel feature of the instrument is that it created the possibility for piano accompaniment  for  amateur  music  making.  In  expanding  the  possibilities  for amateurs, the player piano triggers what will become a large future market. Present-  day access to low-  cost digital production tools leads to what James Buhler  terms  a  'hobbyist  production'  (2021).  Modern  hobbyists  and professionals use a digital audio workstation (DAW), which includes 'software such as Cubase, Logic, Digital Performer, Ableton Live, or ProTools. DAWs are essentially GUIs [graphical user interface] for accessing musical databases of MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) data such as notes

and  automation  files,  audio  samples,  and  settings  for  sound  generators and processors' (Buhler 2021). Much like these digital production tools, the  player  piano  gives  rise  to  a  sort  of  professional  amateur;  its  technically perfect accompaniment removes one barrier from skilled in-  home music production. Composer and MIDI expert Paul D. Lehrman writes, 'When did sequencing begin? Long before computers, long before the crude event generators of early Moogs and VCS3s, there were mechanical instruments that  played  musical  'programs'  '  (2000a).  He  continues,  'Mechanical musical  instruments  reached  their  zenith  at  the  end  of  the  19th  century with the invention of the player piano' (Lehrman 2000a). The player piano preceded, and indeed foreshadowed, the future of digital music.

Early 20th-  century player piano rolls made to provide accompaniment included printed lyrics on the roll, which would scroll by as the roll played and thus allow the singer to follow along in time. As Thomas W. Patteson writes,

the inclusion of song lyrics on piano rolls assumes that player know the tune but not the words of the music-  a distinctly oral (or aural), as opposed to literate, kind of knowledge. The player piano opened up a new field of music-  making activities in between the two poles of professional musicianship and passive listening. In this respect, the player piano could be seen as a precursor to later technologically mediated musical  practices  such  as  Karaoke  singing,  hi-  fi  culture,  and  remix/ mashup.

(2018)

The idea that the player piano was a kind of early 20th-  century karaoke is an interesting one. Not all rolls included lyrics, but often the lyrics appeared elsewhere so people could sing along without needing to learn how to play the accompaniment themselves. I begin this section with a discussion of two singable tunes that had player piano accompaniment rolls, and I connect these songs to popular music from the early 21st century. For each early song, the piano roll includes additional ornaments beyond the notes found in the score, such as octave doublings or echoing gestures, chromatic slides, and dense tremolos. I conclude the section with a brief discussion of the modern digital tools for amateur music making, which are foreshadowed by these player piano rolls.

With words by Otto Hauerbach and music by Rudolf Friml, 1913's The Bubble contains  several  gestures  in  the  accompaniment  that  feature  the mechanical  strengths  of  the  player  piano.  For  example,  the  introduction contains rolled chords that span a tenth in the left hand and an octave in the right, with 'bells' that echo 8va in  the right hand as well. Then, for the majority of the first verse, the right hand tremolos on harmonies that smoothly shift via passing chromaticism. The melody follows a D major

scale and each line ascends, reaching higher as the bubble rises and then slowly falls as the verse closes. Notably, The Bubble is from High Jinks , a musical farce about patients who drink an elixir that is a kind of love potion. In Friml's musical setting the slow ( Poco Lento ) tempo and compound triple meter lend the melody and accompaniment a kind of weightlessness, which adds to the overall e/ffect of a drug-  induced love stupor.

The Alcoholic Blues (Some Blues) ,  from 1919, with words by Edward Laska and music by Albert Vontilzer, tells of a particular type of wartime frustration. The first verse recounts a devotion to one's country and a willingness to do one's part-  'I never even hesitate, I never frown, I cut my sugar, I cut my coal.' But then the chorus comes in and the singer tells us, 'I've got the blues, I've got the blues, I've got the alcoholic blues,' missing beer,  whiskey, highball, and gin. Then, the song again connects with the war, singing, 'they amputated my booze.' The song critiques prohibition, calling it by name and complaining of thirst, and then again bringing up the war with, 'I wouldn't mind to live forever in a trench, just if my daily thirst they only let me quench.' The melody of The Alcoholic Blues (Some Blues) includes chromatic ornamentation around the dominant and supertonic. The melody begins with a descending arpeggiation of the tonic triad, ornamented with raised scale-  degree 4, and then this arpeggiation sequences up to ii, G minor, that functions as the pre-  dominant before a half cadence in m. 8 of the melody. The second half of the verse follows a similar pattern, beginning with a stepwise ascent from scale-  degree 1 to scale-  degree 5 in mm. 9-  12 and then a stepwise ascent from scale-  degree 2 to scale-  degree 5 for another half cadence at the end of the verse. The chorus contains similarly  predictable chromatic alterations of scale-  degree 4, but it also pulls in the lowered versions of scale-  degrees 6 and 7, most notably setting the 'blues' of 'alcoholic blues' on a whole-  note flat 7.

Each of these songs exemplify the unique opportunity the player piano had  to  serve  as  a  kind  of  in-  home  musical  accompaniment.  This  meant popular song could become a new party game, one potentially completely removed from the skilled musician. While a skilled pianolist would create a musical rendition of a given roll, even an unskilled operator could produce the correct notes given the piano roll, and thus for low-  stakes environments one could still enjoy singing along to popular music of the time. With or without the roll's ornamentation, the popular songs given in this section depict various aspects of early 20th-  century society-  war, sexism, prohibition, etc.-  in a way that is very similar to how late 20th and early 21st centuries' popular music reflects its own cultural milieu. Moreover, the editing practices used on these piano rolls to enhance the accompaniment they provide foreshadow the editing common to most popular music today.

In modern musical recording practices, editing is the norm; sound engineers and editors use technology to improve the quality of a performance. For the most part, mainstream recordings are often edited much more now

when compared with the quantization of celebrity piano rolls. The most obvious example of this is Auto-  Tune, which filters singers' voices to make sure the sounds that the audience hears are in tune. Sometimes creators try to hide the use of Auto-  Tune, but in some cases its sound is showcased, such as in Cher's Believe (1998), Britney Spears' Womanizer (2008), and Ke$ha's Tik Tok (2009). In terms of labor, a Cher, Spears, or Ke$ha recording is the product of a highly skilled team of editors and sound engineers; their labor is invisible, behind the curtain, and yet indispensable in the creation process. Before mechanical reproduction, musical labor was the product of the musician(s), but in the wake of mechanical reproduction musical labor becomes only one part of a vast system of interrelated labor, wherein the musical product is the result of a team e/ffort. Creating Believe , Womanizer , or Tik Tok involved a kind of assembly line of recording and editing, but rather than the low or moderate skill level of Taylor's factory workers, it instead requires highly skilled and specialized laborers.

The primary way in which many of us experience music is due to an assembly line of machines: a machine to Auto-  Tune the music, a machine to record the music, and, most importantly, a machine to play it back. The player piano as karaoke device foreshadows the modern technology behind Auto-  Tune, but it also leads to DAWs, which stem from the digital revolution that begins with the player piano. What is perhaps most notable in arguing for the connection of DAWs to piano rolls appears in the notational system: notes within the DAW typically appear on what is called the 'piano roll,' directly referencing the player piano's important role in the creation of this technology.

## Haunting the Screen

During the Machine Age, motion pictures reflected social, cultural, and industrial trends, leading to the Taylorized mechanical labor of the downtrodden prisoners in À nous la Liberté ,  the insight into the inner workings of the city in Metropolis , and to Chaplin's comical assembly-  line issues in Modern Times .  The  musical  topic  of  the  mechanical  reverberates  today  through film,  popular  music,  and  music  in  the  classical  tradition.  For  example, Tim Burton's dark fantasy film Edward Scissorhands (1990), and Martin Scorsese's fantasy film Hugo (2011) each depict the machine on screen with a mechanically influenced score that hearkens back to Metropolis ' horns or the busy assembly-  line sounds of Modern Times .

This level of influence carries through into modern films, with scores that may  be  completely  computer-  rendered.  Indeed,  composer  Hans  Zimmer said, '  'when you are writing at the computer the way I do, you perform every note, at one point or another every note that is in the score has been played by me'  ' (quoted in Buhler 2020  277). New technologies shape a , very di/fferent labor market for film composers and musicians than that of

the time of Metropolis , A nous la Liberté , or Modern Times . In the 1990s, as Buhler writes, there was a 'pronounced shift toward digital technologies in the production of music and sound in film, and in the years since 2000,  analog  techniques  have  largely  been  supplanted  by  digital  means. Contemporary soundtracks are thus rendered and built as much as they are composed and recorded' (2020, 273). As I argue throughout this book, this shift is foreshadowed by the player piano's digital technology.

The  digital  age  and  its  computer-  rendered  scores  complicate  work  for musicians and composers. Highly respected and sought-  after composers are not immune from this precarity; 'the digital era has made precarity increasingly acute so that its e/ffects are felt even among the top-  flight composers' (Buhler 2021). Moreover, the modern market's fast pace pushes demand, and this leads film music composers to 'grab for clichés' and 'recycle its products' (Buhler 2021). Thus, it is unsurprising that modern film scores often bring to mind scores from earlier periods of film history.

The  nostalgic  and  quaint  depiction  of  a  large-  geared  machine  and  its anthropomorphized parts in Edward Scissorhands is set to music that would not  be  out  of  place  in Metropolis .  Low  horns  bounce  through  a  steady pattern of eighth notes as the completely mechanized assembly line bakes sugar cookie cutouts. Edward's inventor (Vincent Price) happily wanders around, studying the machine as it labors (note that the human does not labor  at  this  point,  but  instead  watches  in  astonishment  as  the  machine churns out cookies). The machine depicts a surreal kind of cute; the oven that bakes the cookies has a face and arms, and a smiling red-  eyed metal body with whisks for legs beats the eggs for the cookie dough. The inventor grabs a heart-  shaped cookie and holds it up to the empty chest cavity of one of the faceless robots, and the music changes from brass, percussion, and woodwind-  heavy scoring to an ethereal choral 'ooh,' as if to project the human voice into the machine by giving the machine a heart.

Similarly, Scorsese's Hugo follows a young Parisian boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa  Butterfield),  on  his  search  for  the  heart-  shaped  key  to  his  father's automaton. He hopes to unlock a secret within the automaton, a message from his late father. At one point in the movie, Hugo has a nightmare scored by mechanical ticking that gradually crescendos as he realizes the ticking is coming from his chest. When he looks down and sees that he is turning into an automaton the orchestra gradually enters. Blaring horns take over as Hugo begins to panic, launching from bed as the orchestra gains steam and gears close in around him. The ticking of his heart, fully mechanized, continues throughout the scene.

The steampunk mechanical iconography in Edward Scissorhands stands stark against the surreal, pastel suburban setting. Hugo combines modern digital processes like that of Hugo's nightmare with the same visible gears and simple mechanics in order to reclaim the Machine Age, reclaim modernity, thus confronting the unfinished cultural business of the Machine Age.

Both Edward Scissorhands and Hugo depict the dark side of over-  mechanization, the former through Edward himself as a version of Frankenstein's monster with machines (scissors) for hands, and the latter through scenes like  Hugo's  nightmare  wherein  his  body  is  subsumed  by  the  machine, absorbing him into its mechanism. 4  But these films also demonstrate nostalgia  for  simpler  machines,  and  the  machines  and  labor  practices  that seemed so futuristic in Modern Times and Metropolis now seem charming, belonging instead to the genre of surrealistic fantasy. Mechanical sounds as represented in the musical score each contain elements of the musical topic of the mechanical, such as the regular eighth notes and blaring horns that  in Edward  Scissorhands directly  imitate  the  music  of Metropolis or  through  the  ticking  heart  and  relentless  orchestral  scoring  in Hugo. While these two examples demonstrate the machine on screen much like in the discussion of Modern Times and Metropolis earlier, the next section will discuss how a 1958 film illustrates the quaint obsolescence the player piano achieved by the 1950s.

In  Orson  Welles' Touch  of  Evil (1958),  scored  by  Henry  Mancini, corrupt American police captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) investigates a murder in a Mexican border town. Following an unfruitful interview he walks into the street and hears a waltz ( Tana's Theme ). 'Pianola. Tana's still open for business?' (16:22), he asks aloud. The scene then cuts to the pianola as it scrolls through the roll (16:32). The wall next to the instrument has large cracks and missing chunks of plaster and the wooden frame shows through, indicating that the room, much like the pianola, has seen better  days.  Quinlan  walks  toward  the  music,  limping  with  his  cane  as he chews a candy bar. He opens the door to Tana's brothel as the phrase closes on a perfect authentic cadence before entering the piece's B section. He wanders through the house until he finds Tana (Marlene Dietrich) who takes a drag of her cigarette before telling Quinlan 'we're closed' (17:18). 'Have you forgotten your old friend?' Quinlan asks. The two chat and he says, 'that pianola sure brings back memories.' Tana responds, 'the customers go for it. It's so old it's new. We've got the television, too. We run movies' (18:18).

Later,  Quinlan, a recovering alcoholic, sits at a bar and Tana's Theme enters, this time played by an accordion and woodwind ensemble (49:16). He absentmindedly takes a drink of bourbon only to realize he has just broken  his  sobriety.  The  music  drops  out  (50:54).  Quinlan  returns  to Tana's and sits listening to Blue Pianola on Tana's player piano, a bottle of liquor directly beside him (1:21:37). The screen shifts to Tana, smoking and working on her accounts, and her theme from earlier returns. Quinlan stumbles drunkenly toward her and asks her to tell his fortune (1:22:11). She looks sadly at him and says he has no future: 'Your future is all used up. Why don't you go home?' Her fortune telling proves accurate when Quinlan leaves the brothel and meets his demise. After he dies she appears

accompanied by her theme on pianola (1:35:18). She describes Quinlan, saying, 'he was some kind of a man. What does it matter what you say about people?' The film ends as she walks away.

In Welles' A Touch of Evil , the pianola functions as a nostalgic reminder of  Quinlan's  past.  The  piano's  just  slightly  out-  of-  tune  tinkling,  the  haphazard  way  the  rolls  are  thrown  onto  the  shelves,  and  the  chipped  and damaged plaster on the walls indicate that the house is past its prime. Pianist and  composer  Dick  Hyman  describes  the  pianola's  role  in  this  film  in  a 2006 interview, stating, 'what they used there was the very grave sound of a player-  piano playing a very jolly Mexican waltz. It was so opposed to the grim action that was taking place on the screen that it lent everything a very ironic  cast.  And  sometimes  composers  and  directors  will  spot  an  opportunity to do that' (Ford 2010, 68). Tana even says the pianola is 'so old it's new'-  the novelty of the pianola as a new technology had worn o/ff and been replaced by the novelty of a technology so out of date it was quaint. 5

The instrument's quaintness rests on the fact that it is a returning technology, one that has been out of the popular market for many years but not so long as to be forgotten. Tana keeps the television atop the instrument and it looks small and modern in direct contrast against the pianola's bulky frame. And Quinlan looks bulky and old next to Tana, who was initially unable to recognize Quinlan because he had gained so much weight since their  last  meeting.  After  chiding  Tana  for  not  recognizing  him  Quinlan tells  Tana she is 'sure lookin' good' (18:05). Welles created Tana's role for Dietrich, who maintains her German accent despite playing a Mexican prostitute (Stubbs 1998, 192). Naremore calls Dietrich a '  'cameo' player' and explains her role is meant to 'break the surface of illusion' because we  see  Dietrich  instead  of  her  character  (1989,  171).  The  combination of a German-  accented Mexican prostitute and the outdated pianola blur Quinlan  and  Tana's  scenes,  making  it  seem  as  if  the  pianola  conjures Quinlan's  flawed  memory  of  Tana,  resurrecting  her  from  his  past.  The waltz the pianola plays is outdated, but so is the pianola itself, along with its setting in a run-  down brothel. The pianola-  like Quinlan, like Tana-  is obsolete.

The  player  piano  carries  an  air  of  nostalgia  in Touch  of  Evil because by the 1950s it was well past its prime; sales of the player piano peaked in 1923, 35 years before the film's release (McElhone 2004, 26). Despite its status as an antiquated technology, the player piano's visible mechanics re-  entered the niche music market several times throughout the 1950s and 1960s, even finding a small measure of success with American and English consumers (Ord-  Hume 1970, 42-  3). Its nostalgic power comes from the player piano's importance in establishing music as a consumable object in early  20th-  century  culture,  an  importance  that  historian  Craig  H.  Roell argues carries more weight than that of the phonograph or motion picture. Roell writes of four factors that helped establish music as a commodity:

the contagion of ragtime music, and the invention of the mechanical player piano, the phonograph, and the motion picture. While each of these  inventions  in  time  e/ffected  change  (however  minimized  by  the invention  of  the  radio),  it  was  the  player  piano-  with  its  significant link to Victorian culture, its superior fidelity, and its mass-  production by an influential industry already entrenched in American musical and industrial life-  that was the most powerful force toward establishing a musical democracy in the Victorian twentieth century.

(1989, 32)

Touch of Evil does not reveal Quinlan's age but he looks middle aged, certainly old enough to remember the player piano when it was popular. He likely would have been young and healthy in the 1920s, and based on the way he reacts to Tana and to the pianola he remembers the pre-  Depression era  fondly.  That Touch of Evil chooses  to  use  the  player  piano,  not  the phonograph or radio, to convey a sense of nostalgia and longing is worth noting.

Unlike the phonograph or radio, the player piano is an obsolete technology. It did not improve with time, but rather it fell quite rapidly after its peak. With the rising success of the phonograph following its conversion to electrical recording equipment in 1924, the player piano started to succumb to  the  competition  (Roell  1989,  330-  1).  Additionally,  phonograph  companies allied themselves with radio companies, combining the two machines into a kind of 'radio-  phonograph.' Radio technology improved quite a bit in the 1920s including improvements in amplification that then carried over into  phonograph technology; the sale  of  radios  and  phonograph  records quickly crippled player piano sales. 6

Much  like  those  of  phonograph  records,  sales  of  player  pianos  and their rolls fell drastically after the 1929 stock market crash, and unlike the records, the player piano market never recovered. The Depression essentially eradicated player pianos from the musical marketplace, firmly turning consumers'  ears  toward  records  and  radios.  Despite  the  player  piano's ultimate  demise,  the  musical  topic  of  the  mechanical  continues.  In  addition, the sounds of earlier films endure in recycled scoring, which draws connections between films across decades and genres. Most importantly, the music of today-  and the technological labor behind that music-  was precipitated by the player piano.

## Reviving the Machine

The 1926 version of Ballet Mécanique was not published until 2003, when engraver and music editor George A. McGuire, expert pianolist Rex Lawson, and composer and music engineer Paul D. Lehrman collaborated to reproduce the score for G. Schirmer. In an interview about his reconstruction of

the original version of the Ballet , Lehrman describes why he thinks the piece fell to the wayside, stating,

there  was  no  real  reason  to  do  the  piece.  It  was  a  joke.  It  was  very hard to  play.  It  required  an  instrument  that  nobody  really  had  anymore. Antheil himself rewrote the piece in 1952 without a player piano. He wrote a completely di/fferent version for Ballet Mécanique using a lot of the same thematic material, but it's much shorter, much faster, much tighter, it doesn't have the siren, it doesn't have the electric bells. It does have two airplane propellers and has a lot more percussion in it. Actually, it's a very nice piece, it's a well-  constructed piece, which bears a  passing  resemblance to the original Ballet  Mécanique ,  but  is  really quite di/fferent. That piece does get done occasionally.

(Wright 2003)

According  to Lehrman,  Bill Holab,  Schirmer's publications director, 'recognized (sic) that the piece of the puzzle which Antheil didn't have was MIDI' (2000a). Lehrman sequenced Ballet  Mécanique on  his  Macintosh computer, and 'using the synths and samplers in my home-  studio, as well as a newly installed surround monitoring system, I could revel in an all-  MIDI performance of this piece-  a piece which no-  one, including the composer, had ever heard before' (2000b). What Lehrman did not realize is that his journey with Antheil's Ballet would not end there.

In  October  of  2005,  Stephen  Ackert,  head  of  Washington  D.C.'s National Gallery of Art music department, contacted Lehrman and asked, 'A concert of Ballet  Mécanique could  only  be  a  one-  time  event  …  but was there an alternative that would get the Ballet Mécanique to live in the  museum,  the  way  paintings  and  sculpture  do?'  Lehrman  'immediately came up with an answer: robots' (Lehrman 2007). Lehrman, along with musician and engineer Eric Singer, helped put together a fully automatic  27-  piece  orchestra  at  the  National  Gallery.  The  robot  ensemble was to play Lehrman's realization of the Ballet Mécanique over 100 times between March 12 and March 29, 2006, as part of a Dada art exhibition. QRS Music Technologies (a piano roll company originally a/ffiliated with Story &amp; Clark; QRS claims to be the only company to still produce piano rolls) provided the 16 MIDI-  compatible Gulbransen grand pianos, and most non-  player piano parts were played by MIDI-  controlled robots on  real  instruments  (Lehrman  and  Singer  2008,  14).  They  used  industrial fans to simulate airplane propellers, just as Antheil did (Lehrman and Singer 2008, 15). They planned for the entire orchestra to play without any human intervention (Lehrman and Singer 2008, 14). In other words, this performance happened because of the increased accessibility to and capabilities of improved musical technology; MIDI technology made this performance possible.

The Ballet installation was successful, receiving glowing reviews from the Washington  Post ,  the Associated  Press ,  ABC's Good Morning, America , and NPR's Fresh Air . Due to its success, the Washington gallery extended its initial 17-  day run for another eight weeks. Lehrman and Singer write, 'The Ballet Mécanique installation at the National Gallery of Art proved to be one of the most popular exhibits in that institution's history. Thousands of listeners gathered for the twice-  daily performances' (Lehrman and Singer 2008, 17). In an interesting reversal, Antheil's Ballet in  its  original  form drew  an  audience  nearly  80  years  after  its  original  premiere,  while  the revised concert-  hall version of 1952 seems outdated, stuck in the concert hall. McGuire, Lawson, Lehrman, and Singer mechanized Antheil's Ballet Mécanique , using the original scoring to realize Antheil's vision of a work he claimed to be 'like machines. All e/fficiency … Revolutionary as nothing has  been  revolutionary.' 7   As  the  Antheil  revival  shows,  interest  in  automatic, self-  playing instruments continues into the 21st century.

## Decay: A Conclusion

To  some  the  1920s  were  the  'decade  of  prosperity,'  but  while  other industries  thrived  the  piano  industry  dwindled  and  many  large  piano manufacturers shut their doors. Only brands that adapted to the changing times by making smaller models and promoting the piano's nostalgic place in the home-  played by members of that home-  survived the Depression (Roell 1989, 330-  1). The player piano-  the skilled, mechanical, and more expensive sister to the silent piano-  did not survive, or at least not in the mainstream market. Indeed, Roell goes so far as to claim that 'the piano industry in general has not recovered the production nor the market that it enjoyed from 1909 to 1923' (1989, 330-  1).

Nearly  a  century  has  passed  since  the  player  piano's  popularity peaked, and yet we still hear their mechanical reverberations today. The performer's role-  or lack thereof-  particularly demonstrates how shifting labor practices impacted the musical milieu. Traditionally, musical labor produces  musical  works.  Or,  rather,  musical  labor-  musicians'  laborreproduces musical  works. 8   But  mechanical  reproduction  and  sound recording complicate musical labor and performance by eliminating, changing,  or  supplementing  various  elements  of  the  performance  equation, an  equation  traditionally  based  on  the  economy  of  listener,  performer, and composer. 9  Reproductions and recordings then convert the resulting product into a musical commodity that both resembles and counters live performance.  Unlike  live  performance,  reproductions  and  recordings claim  to  o/ffer  perfection-  perfectly  executed,  perfectly  quantized  and humanized, perfectly impossible renditions of works. Reproductions and recordings o/ffer human performance concretized as musical and technical precision.

Editing early phonograph records was at best di/fficult and usually took place before or during the recording process. 10  The process often required numerous takes from the performer, hoping for a lucky 'perfect' performance from a single take. The record, once recorded, was no longer editable except through a rudimentary form of dubbing, so recordists and engineers put musicians through a kind of pre-  editing process, staging performers at certain distances from the horn and requiring all dynamics be mezzoforte or softer (Taylor 2012, 23-  5). One account from 1910 claims musicians were required to stand on stools or platforms, spread around the room ( The Violinist 1910, 7).

Player piano rolls, on the other hand, were relatively easy to edit and perfect-  the process involved measuring and punching or re-  punching the roll, depending on a given company's equipment and whether it required the music be played onto the roll or punched in manually ( Scientific American 1927, 422).  The  player  piano,  not  the  phonograph  record,  saw  greater  success earlier, while the record would not surpass the roll in popularity until the mid-  1920s when microphones and an electrical process greatly improved the recording quality and amplification improved the reproduced sound.

Industrialized labor practices and machines are a part of our lives in ways that seem unprecedented, and yet the ways in which we represent and use machines musically are clearly foreshadowed by the musical examples used throughout this book. As labor becomes more automatic and dependent upon digital technologies, current culture displays a kind of nostalgia for the simplistic machines of the early 20th century. Their gears evoke a supposedly simpler time when it was possible to visually trace how a given machine worked; their ticking, clicking, and squeaking all point to the kinds of mechanical motion we no longer see with the advanced technologies of today, encased within the plastic, metal, and glass frames of our laptops, iPads, and smartphones.

- 6  The reproducing piano system peaked slightly later, in 1925, but it saw the same rapid decline as the player piano, especially once the stock market crashed in 1929 (Peres da Costa 2012). See also: Adorno 2009; Lastra 2000.

- 8  The following works discuss the philosophy of performance and the work in performance: Cone 1968; Goehr 1992; and Kivy 1995.
- 9  Notable scholarly works on this subject include Meyer 1956; Sessions 1950; and Rink 1995.
