James Callaghan

The reorganisation now of society on classless lines by the proletariat will release immense energies in an uninhibited environment. It is a miserable, cringing mentality, confined to the 'higher standard of living of our people', striving to hold on to what it has and to keep people where they are, which does not understand that the only way out is to give people new visions of themselves, so that they will find new ways to express them and to create new ties, new bonds and a new understanding between those who are now so divided.

## Preface

This book is an attempt to put in historical perspective the Black presence in  Britain  as  it  relates  to  the  development  of  British  capitalism  and  its control and exploitation of black labour. The making of the black working class  in  twentieth-century  Britain  has  been  a  long  process,  reflecting essential  changes  in  Britain's  labour  needs  over  time,  both  at  home  and abroad.

As overseas trade expanded, the discipline and control of labour (both black and white) became imperative to Britain's economic well-being. To ensure the continued exploitation of colonial labour, an ideology based on racial differences, which bred an inferior/superior nexus both in interpersonal  relations  and  in  international  trade,  was  constructed  to  keep Blacks in subjection.

Thus,  plantocracy  racism  supported  by  British  capitalists,  politicians, historians  and  influential  people  of  letters,  engendered  dogmatic  belief  in white  supremacy  and  institutionalised  racism  in  Britain  and  her  colonial 'possessions'.  Consequently,  the  cultural  transmission  of  racist  ideas  was handed  down  over  generations.  Historically,  as  Blacks  in  the  colonies laboured under the inhuman and deplorable working conditions endemic in slavery,  indentureship  and  trade  union-regulated  working  conditions,  in response, they resorted either 'spontaneously' or in an 'organised' way to

various forms of resistance, creating in the process, their own ideologies of Indian  nationalism,  Pan  Africanism  and  Black  Power,  and  autonomous organisation. This tradition of struggle has, in turn, informed and strengthened the black working-class movements both in the colonies and Britain in recent years.

In order to avoid any confusion that might arise in the reader's mind, it is  perhaps  necessary  to  define  the  'black  working  class'  in  the  context  of this book. In general, 'black' refers to non-white persons, particularly those from  former  colonial  and  Commonwealth  countries.  Within  this  usage, there  are  sub-divisions  denoting  the  various  constituent  groups:  these  are Africans, Asians,  West  Indians, Afro-Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, AsianCaribbeans  and  Black  British.  'Working  class'  refers  essentially  to  those unskilled  and  semi-skilled  Blacks  who  came  to  Britain  throughout  the period, but particularly during the heavy post-war immigration in search of jobs.

The  task  of  writing  this  book  has  been  made  less  onerous  by  the encouragement  of  many  people,  particularly  Tim  O'Keeffe  and  Louise Floyd; Ziggi Alexander, Jane Anthony, Crispin Cross, Ghazala Faizi, Moira Ferguson, Peter Fraser, Peter Fryer, David Hill, Peter Hogg, David Paisey, Lina  Patel,  Brian  Rooney, Allen  Synge  and  Rosina  Visram.  I  would  also like  to  thank  many  of  my  colleagues  and  members  of  staff  in  the  British Library  (at  the  Reference  Division,  Bloomsbury,  the  Newspaper  Library, Colindale  and  the  India  Office  Library);  the  staffs  at  the  Public  Records Office  Library  (Chancery  Lane  and  Kew);  the  Library  of  Economics  and Political  Science;  the  Institute  of  Commonwealth  Studies  Library;  the Labour Party Library, and A.

## Introduction to the Second Edition

On 16 April 2016, a special event was held at Congress House in Central London to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the completed manuscript of The  Making  of  the  Black  Working  Class  in  Britain .  The  occasion  was filmed  and  a  clip  titled  'An Audience  with  Ron  Ramdin'  was  put  online. Prior to the event, I was approached by Verso Books about republishing the book. For both the book and myself to be so honoured made me pause for reflection.

On  its  first  publication  in  1987,  a  book  reviewer  in New  Society described  it as a 'pioneering  and  valuable  work  of  scholarship  and interpretation'. I was struck by 'valuable work of scholarship and interpretation'. Why?  Because  hitherto  I'd not read such a positive reference to any book on the history of Black people in Britain, especially one  featuring  Black  workers.  Even  more  encouraging  educationally,  the book was widely read and used by researchers, students, and writers. As one author  put  it,  he  had  'cannibalised'  the  book  for  his  own  work. As  time passed, in-depth academic book reviews appeared in the British Journal of Sociology ,  the American  Journal  of  Sociology and History  Today among others;  and  the Times newspaper  included  it  in  its  'Pick  of  Paperbacks'. Given that hitherto British historians had largely ignored the long-standing existence of Black and Asian people in Britain, from the outset, I'd intended

that The Making should take a long view of this hidden presence, certainly long enough to show continuity. In the context of an expansive history, this 'presence' and contribution, I felt, would make more sense than it would in any  short, largely general  account  and,  at the same  time,  correct  a widespread  misunderstanding  that  Black  people  began  coming  to  Britain only in the 1950s. Thus, given that there had been Black people in Britain since Roman times, I structured the book in three parts to cover the period from 1555 to 1986; a perspective which I thought was preferential if one was to better understand not only the pre-twentieth-century Black presence, but  also  the  interwar  period  and  the  turbulent  forty  years  prior  to  1986. Overall, such a long view of Black people in Britain would, I felt, not only incorporate their multifaceted contribution both in war and peacetime, but also  place The Making as  an  integral  study  relating  to  a  deeply  ingrained attitude and therefore to all aspects of British society.

After  I'd  published From  Chattel  Slave  to  Wage  Earner ,  a  work  on labour history in the Caribbean, I was surprised that there was no book on Black workers in Britain. Thereafter,  I  became  increasingly  fascinated  by the pre- and early-twentieth-century contribution of Black and Asian people to the British economy. As I stated in the preface to The Making ,

To ensure the continued exploitation of colonial labour, an ideology based on racial differences,  which  bred  an  inferior/superior  nexus, both  in interpersonal relations and  in international trade, was constructed to keep Blacks in subjection … Historically, as Blacks in the colonies laboured under the inhuman and deplorable working conditions endemic  in  slavery, indentureship and  trade unionregulated  working  conditions,  in  response,  they  resorted  either 'spontaneously'  or  in  an  'organised'  way  to  various  forms  of resistance,  creating  in  the  process,  their  own  ideologies  of  Indian Nationalism,  Pan  Africanism  and  Black  Power,  and  autonomous organisation.  This  tradition  of  struggle  has,  in  turn,  informed  and strengthened  Black  working-class  movements  both  in  the  colonies and Britain in recent years.

As  these  ideas  and  struggles  evolved,  I  continued  to  question  aspects  of social orthodoxy - namely race, tribe, caste, colour, class, gender, culture, religion  and  so  on  -  categorisations  reflecting  aspects  of  divisive  social

behaviour that were more often than not to be found in various academic journals and books. Indeed in relation to one of these forms of totalisation class - I was surprised to find that after years of research contrary to my understanding,  one  famous  textbook, The Making of the English Working Class , had  entirely  overlooked  the  presence  and  contribution  of  Black leaders who were prominent in English working-class struggles.

For the purposes of The Making of the Black Working Class in Britain , my definitions of 'Black' and 'working class' were clear. Thirty years on, those descriptions are still relevant and often used today by trade unionists, socialists, politicians and social commentators. In recent years, however, the influx of migrants (including those seeking asylum and refugees) from all over the world has added to an even more diverse working population; an extraordinary commingling of people speaking a large number of languages, especially in London and the larger British cities.

Soon after I'd completed the manuscript there was no doubt in my mind that The Making (for  so  long  a  hidden  story)  was  an  essential  and  timely text which not only broadens and gives depth to our understanding of the past, but also foregrounds an evolving multicultural Britain. It was also very rare that a book of this kind should become a bestseller and quickly go out of  print  at  a  time  when  academics  were  still  largely  disinterested  in  the growing  populations  of  Black  and  ethnic  minorities  as  integral  to  British history.  But  while The  Making has  been  informative  for  students  and general readers, for a new generation of those born and bred in Britain, as well as new immigrants from outside the Commonwealth, a great deal was (and  is)  taken  for  granted!  Some  fundamental  'rights'  (for  example,  the Race Relations Act, affecting people at the workplace and in communities) enjoyed  by  today's  citizens  were  not  achieved  overnight.  In  fact,  such 'rights' became law as a direct result of insistent, bitter campaigns against racism and sexism waged by Black and Asian workers in the 1960s, 1970s and  1980s.  But  while  there  has  been  change,  racism  and  sexism  have persisted.

This  year  marks  the  fortieth  anniversary  of  the  Grunwick  strike.  The 'Grunwick  40'  exhibition  currently  on  display  in  the  Brent  Museum  and Archives  at  the  Willesden  Library  retells  the  celebrated  story  of  the 'Strikers  in  Saris'.  Thus,  by  the  1980s,  the  heightened  consciousness  of Black  workers  had  generated  the  need  to  form  autonomous  organisations which  pointed  the  way  ahead.  For  me  as  a  writer, The  Making was  a

watershed,  the  beginning  of  a  new  phase  in  my  intellectual  development. My quest was for a deeper truth about people and society for, in spite of their  relevance,  I  felt  there  was  too  much  of  a  cosy  woolliness  about  the prevailing  ideas  such  as  race,  class,  colour,  gender,  culture  and  religion. Something  vital  was  missing.  Thus  I  committed  myself  to  an  intense exploration  of  these  ideas  while  I  continued  to  write  about  histories, cultures and identities. The result was that twelve years after The Making , I published Reimaging Britain ,  which helped to clarify in my mind the idea of difference, of celebrating 'the creative potential of human difference'. So far so good, I thought, but not good enough.

And so fifteen years after the publication of Reimaging Britain, I took a further step and confronted head on the totalising effect of social categorisations such as race, class, tribe, colour, gender, culture and religion which  stymies  individuals  ('Striker  in  Saris',  for  example)  instead  of freeing them. Thus since The Making of the Black Working Class in Britain , given  the  making  and  remaking  process,  my  ideas  continued  to  evolve crucially from autonomous organisation to respect for difference.

Today,  the  fundamental  question  that  confronts  us  is  this:  where  are Black and ethnic minority workers located in the employment structure? As if  to  confirm  the  persistent,  stark  daily  lived  reality  of  many  working people,  a  few  reports  on  pay  and  disadvantage  have  recently  appeared. 'Analysis of pay data by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggests that the difference in average pay rates amounts to a gap of 23 percent,' stated a BBC Education  and  Social Affairs  report  titled  'Black  Workers  'earning less than white colleagues' adding that Black graduates earn less than their white counterparts, the average pay gap between Black and white workers with A-levels being 14 percent; and at GCSE level, the gap is 11 percent. So many issues raised and dealt with in The Making , including the inequities in relation to race, education and pay, still confront us. A generation on, how should we address the problem?

Frances  O'Grady,  the  TUC  General  Secretary  identified  the  problem: 'Race  still  plays  a  huge  role  in  determining  pay.'  She  added  the  'harsh reality is that at any level of education, Black and Asian workers are getting paid LESS than their white counterparts. The Government cannot afford to ignore  these  figures  and  must  now  take  genuine  action  to  tackle  pay discrimination.' And what role could or should the government play? One way forward was urgently needed 'interventions'. When  dealing  with  the

deprived  and  disadvantaged,  the  last  Labour  Government  was  convinced throughout  its  long  reign  that  the  key  to  social  mobility  was  'education, education,  education'. Alas,  whatever  the  beneficial  effects  of  the  Labour Government's  policies,  though  masked  by  self-righteous  rhetoric  (and,  at times,  exaggerated  political  correctness),  deep-seated  problems  remain. While disproportionality in the number of disadvantaged Blacks and Asians attending universities was flagged up repeatedly as a major hurdle, beyond this, there were  other consequential  inequalities to confront. Various researchers, including those at the BBC and the race equality think tank the Runnymede  Trust  have  found  that  'pay  gaps  are  not  due  to  the  type  of university  attended,  they  even  extend  to  Black  workers  with  degrees'.  In fact,  the  TUC's  analysis,  based  on  the  Labour  Force  Survey  figures  from 2014 and 2015, shows the pay gaps were widest among the more qualified. And so education is not working for the benefit of the aspirant as it should. This  is  shocking.  Such  evidence  of  'pay  gaps'  is  confirmed  by  recent findings of the University of Essex and the Institute of Economic and Social Research. The  implications  of  these  workplace  inequalities  on  the  rest  of society  are  significant.  Furthermore,  the  British  Referendum  on  23  June 2016, which resulted in the British people's decision to leave the European Union,  will,  no  doubt,  have  unknown  consequences  for  migrant  workers, especially Blacks and Asians.

Given repeated demands for change, indeed the need for 'interventions', the Prime Minister, concerned with developing a race-equality educational strategy  said,  'Transparency  would  force  top  universities  like  Oxford  to work harder to broaden their intake.' Fine words from the leading politician, but in spite of his 'intervention' a few weeks later, on 14 September 2016, an Evening  Standard headline  read:  'POLICE  DO  TARGET  BLACK PEOPLE.' In the article Scotland Yard's new diversity chief, Victor Olisa, a Black man, admitted 'stop and search' on the streets targeted Black people. Thirty  years  earlier  in The  Making , I  had  written  at  length  about  'sus charges',  Black  youth  and  confrontations  between  Black  people  and  the police. Now, with great interest, I read that the police were still 'routinely discriminating  against  Black  people  in  stop  and  search  operations  in London  as  part  of  a  misguided  performance  culture'.  Furthermore,  the diversity  chief  attested  that  'it  was  accepted  practice  to  stop  young  black men to try to boost arrest rates for drugs such as cannabis'. To avoid the 'negative stereotyping of black people', he felt stop and search should not

only be based on intelligence, but most importantly officers should be able 'to  explain  as  an  individual  why  you  stopped  Joe  Bloggs'.  This  official statement points to the very essence of the evolving ideas contained in The Making that  culminated in the recent publication of my original essay On Respect  for  Difference . Given  that  'difference  is the DNA  of  social relations', crucially I concluded the essay in relation to migrations and the globalized  world  thus:  'Like  Britain,  few  countries  can  claim  to  have  an 'indigenous'  population.  But  wherever  human  beings  congregate  in  socalled civilized communities and societies, the insistent calls for 'freedom' and  'human  rights'  would  indeed  remain  elusive,  meaningless  slogans, unless people genuinely relate to each other with respect for difference .'

Against this background, in scope and depth, educationally the value of The Making of the Black Working Class in Britain is as timely now (if not more so) as it was when it first appeared: an instructive, informative text for readers  regardless  of  age,  race,  class,  colour,  gender,  culture  or  religion about  a  crucial  period  in  our  past.  It  is  at  once  of  major  historical  and contemporary  significance;  an  educational  resource  that  crucially  adds  to our  understanding  of  neglected  aspects  of  British  history.  The  oft-quoted historian  Peter  Fryer,  in  his  'Suggestion  for  Further  Reading'  on  Black history  stated,  'Some  gaps  in  this  cursory  reading  are  due  to  gaps  in  the literature  …  One  at  least  of  these  gaps  will  be  filled  by  Ron  Ramdin's forthcoming  history  of  the  black  working  class  in  Britain.'  In  fact The Making is about a great deal more. Significantly this new edition is the first book to incorporate a 'forgotten' and little known aspect of 'British' history which  hitherto  chroniclers  of  the  Black  presence  have  either  not  known about  or  had  overlooked:  for  many  people,  Dadabhai  Naoroji,  elected  in 1892 is known as the first Black MP. But new research refutes this. The first Black Member of Parliament was James Townsend, whose election to the House of Commons predates Naoroji by some 125 years. He was also the first  Black  Lord  Mayor  of  London.  (For  more  on  the  fascinating  story  of James  Townsend,  see  Appendix  VI.)  And  so The  Making  of  the  Black Working  Class  in  Britain ,  described  thirty  years  ago  by The  Times as  a 'pioneering' book continues to enlighten us. Its republication is a rare event which  gives  due  recognition  of  its  place  in  British  history,  culture  and society.

The 'Blackamoores' Presence (1555-1900)

## 1 Profits, Slavery and the Black Poor

The long standing presence of black people in Britain dates back to Roman times.  By  the  seventeenth  century  many  were  employed  as  servants, pageant performers, court jesters and musicians. Later, this black presence would  become  significant  as  trade  and  economic  expansion  forged  a fundamental  connection  between  the  demands  of  British  capitalism  and black labour. Indeed, it was argued that Negro slavery and the slave trade were  responsible  for  providing  the  capital  which  financed  the  Industrial Revolution in England and of 'mature' industrial capitalism which, in turn, destroyed the slave system. 1 Since this thesis was propounded, it has been hotly disputed and debated by historians. The purpose here is not to pursue this  argument,  directly.  Nevertheless,  a  significant  consequence  of  the commerce and trade in slaves, cotton and sugar was that black people began to appear in England in increasing numbers. And throughout the period of slavery,  and  thereafter,  black  labour  has  remained  a  crucial  factor  in  the development of the British economy.

The rise of African slavery

The  arrival  of  Christopher  Columbus  in  the  New  World  had  far-reaching consequences.  England  joined  Spain  and  Portugal  in  their  rivalry  over actual  and  potential  colonial  possessions  as  a  result  of  Cabot's  voyage  to North  America  in  1497.  By  1580  the  English  government  sought  to implement the principle of effective occupation in determining sovereignty. In  the  struggle  for  possession  in  the  West  Indies,  the  'Iberian  Axis'  was challenged by England, France and Holland. In this struggle for a 'place in the  sun',  as  Eric  Williams  put  it,  'The  negro,  too,  was  to  have  his  place, though he did not ask for it: it was the broiling sun of the sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations of the New World.' 2

In  the  ensuing  years,  the  English  claim  to  colonial  possessions  grew. The major economic determinant of prosperity in a new colony, according to  Adam  Smith,  the  English  economist,  was  'plenty  of  good  land'.  Not surprisingly, by 1776, British colonial possessions were already divided into two types, the self-sufficient and diversified economy of small farmers and the  colony  with  facilities  for  the  large-scale  production  of  staples  for  an export market. The northern colonies of the American mainland were in the first category, while the mainland tobacco colonies and the sugar islands of the  Caribbean  fell  in  the  second.  Given  that  both  land  and  capital  were useless unless labour could be controlled and disciplined, labour became of primary concern to the British colonial planter.

To  achieve  the  maximum  gains,  the  kind  of  labour  required  on  the plantations  had  to  be  constant  and  able  to  work  in  co-operation.  These demands resulted in a dispersal of the rugged individualist small farmers. The alternative for the Caribbean colonies was slavery. This system was an economic  institution  of  the  first  importance,  a  key  factor  in  large-scale plantation production. As one historian saw it:

In modern times it provided the sugar for the tea and coffee cups of the  Western  world.  It  produced  the  cotton  to  serve  as  a  base  for modern capitalism. It made the American South and the Caribbean islands. Seen in historical perspective, it forms a part of that general picture  of  the  harsh  treatment  of  the  underprivileged  classes,  the unsympathetic poor laws and severe feudal laws, and the indifference with which the rising capitalist class was 'beginning to reckon prosperity in terms of sacrificing human life to the deity of increased production'. 3

While slaves and land-hunger moved in tandem, the role of the African in slavery  became  crucial.  Although  slavery  in  the  Caribbean  has  been narrowly identified with the African, it is clear that a racial twist had been invented  and  superimposed  on  what  was  fundamentally  an  economic institution. For slavery was not the result of racism but rather, racism was the consequence of slavery. 4 Before the African, unfree labour in the New World  was  brown,  white,  black  and  yellow.  In  fact,  the  first  instance  of slave trading and slave labour developed in the New World involveds not the 'Negro' but the Indian. Indian slavery, never sufficiently extensive in the British  Dominions,  did  not  interfere  with  African  slavery.  The  planters demanded  sheer  physical  strength  for  the  future  production  of  the  New World staples, sugar and cotton. This, they felt, the Indians lacked. Indeed, the Spaniards had already sought in 1518 that 'permission be given to bring Negroes, a race robust for labour, instead of natives so weak that they can only be employed in tasks requiring little endurance, such as taking care of maize  fields  or  farms'. 5 The  epithets  'cotton  nigger'  and  'sugar  mules' became common usage. While the supply of Indians was limited, that of the African  was  plentiful.  Thus,  with  time,  the  system  of  slavery  forged  an inseparable link between West Africa and the West Indies.

It is important to point out, however, that the immediate successor of the Indian was the poor white, not the African. These white servants comprised indentured servants, 'redemptioners' and convicts. Between 1654 and 1685 a regular traffic developed in these indentured servants; ten thousand sailed from  Bristol  to  the  West  Indies  and  Virginia.   In  1683,  one-sixth  of 6 Virginia's  population  were  white  servants. As  the  trade  in  white  servants prospered, commercial  speculation  encouraged  abuses. Kidnapping  in London and Bristol became part of a regular business. Convicts provided another  source  of  steady  labour.  While  Benjamin  Franklin  opposed  this 'dumping upon the New World of the outcasts of the Old' the West Indies was  prepared  to  accept  'even  the  spawn  of  Newgate  and  Bridewell'.  In effect,  these  colonies  became  the  dumping  ground  for  the  'riff-raff'  of British society. 7

Moreover, the political and civil disturbances in England between 1640 and  1740  helped  to  supply  white  servants.  Transportation,  mostly  to  the sugar  islands,  was  the  penalty  imposed  on  political  and  religious  nonconformists, such as Cromwell's Irish prisoners who were sent to the West

Indies. Transportation was actively associated with the West Indies to the extent that to 'Barbadoes' a person became a verb in the English vernacular.

As  trading  links  grew  stronger,  the  transportation  of  servants  and convicts produced a powerful vested interest in England. Indeed, when the Colonial Board was set up in 1661 one of its more important duties was to control  the  trade  in  indentured  servants.  By  the  end  of  the  seventeenth century,  the  aim  of  economic  policy  in  England  was  the  development  of industry, the promotion of employment and the encouragement of exports. But,  the  question  of  emigration  from  the  home  country  to  the  colonies produced  a  serious  debate.  In  the  context  of  the  argument  that  'whatever tends to the depopulation of a Kingdom tends to the impoverishment of it', a British population drain was costly and had to be stemmed. A policy of drawing on cheap labour from elsewhere to people the colonial plantations was  under  serious  consideration.  By  then,  the  Royal  Family  had  already given patronage to the Royal African Company and the African slave trade. Thus, Africa aided British capitalism in launching its process of industrialisation.

By 1680 there was already evidence 8  (in Barbados) that the African was more  suited  to  the  demands  of  production  than  the  European.  It  seemed clear then that white servitude had no place in a system of chattel slavery. The  servant's  loss  of  liberty  was  for  a  short  period  of  time,  while  the African was a slave for life. Furthermore, the servants' status was passed on to their offspring, but African children assumed the status of their mother. The servants also had rights. In the final analysis, the fact that the Negro slave was cheaper proved to be decisive. The cost of securing a white man's services  for  ten  years  could  buy  an  African  for  life! 9 The  Governor  of Barbados stated that 'three blacks work better and cheaper than one white man'. 10

The experience of one trade served as a rough guide for another. Not surprisingly, therefore, Bristol, the hub of the white servants trade, played the role as one of the centres of the slave trade.

The  reason  for  the  origin  of  negro  slavery  then,  was  economic,  not racial;  it  was  the  cheapness  of  labour  rather  than  the  colour  of  the  labour which was decisive. Features such as hair and colour were the subsequent rationalisations to justify the simple economic fact that to fill the vacuum of colonial labour requirements, African labour was resorted to because it was

cheapest and best. Moreover, it is important to understand that where the whites disappeared, the cause was not the climate, but the replacement of the  small  farm  by  the  large  plantation  and  its  consequent  demand  for  a large,  cheap  and  steady  labour  supply.  African  slavery's  origin  can  be expressed in terms of three plantation products: sugar, tobacco and cotton. A change in the economic structure produced a corresponding change in the labour supply. In the Caribbean slave society King Sugar reigned supreme. This  was  a  society  in  which  there  were  only  two  necessary  classes  -  the wealthy (absentee) planters and the oppressed slaves, the exploiters and the exploited.

## Profits

In comparison with the wealthy planters of the sugar islands, the planters in the  tobacco  colonies  came  a  poor  second.  The  West  Indian  sugar  planter was among the biggest capitalists in the mercantilist era. Indeed, the West Indian (with wealth beyond dispute) was dramatised in a play at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London in 1771. 11 He became a familiar figure in the English social scene in the eighteenth century. But why was he lording it in England when he should have been attending to his fortune-making sugar plantations  in  the  West  Indies?  The  answer  must  be  sought  in  absentee landlordism; 12 the 'curse of the Caribbean'.

Absenteeism  affected  the  prosperity  of  the  islands.  One  of  the  more serious consequences  was  the  mismanagement  of  the  plantations by overseers. There was also the growing imbalance between the whites and the  black  slave  populations.  The  slave  population  increased  making  the prospect of rebellions real. Nevertheless, risk-taking was incidental to the fundamental fact that slavery meant wealth.

Among  the  absentee  landlords  of  the  sugar  plantations,  the  most prominent were the Beckfords, an old Gloucestershire family. Sir Thomas Beckford  was  among  the  first  absentee  proprietors,  getting  £2000  per annum net (of all charges) from his Jamaican holdings. 13  Another member of  the  family,  Peter  Beckford,  became  the  most  distinguished  of  the  new colonists, holding military and civil positions in Jamaica. When he died in 1710,  he  left  'the  largest  property  real  and  personal  of  any  subject  in

Europe'. 14 In 1737 William, his grandson, with the inheritance of the family wealth became 'the most powerful West Indian planter in England'.

Another  family  with  West  Indian  interests  were  the  Hibberts.  They operated as planters and merchants, supplying cotton and linen checks for the plantations and the African market. The income received from his West Indian property was enough to enable Robert Hibbert to live comfortably in Bedfordshire.  The  abolition  of  slavery  brought  its  compensation  to  the Hibberts. They received £31,120 for their 1618 slaves. 15

The  Long  family  were  also  connected  with  Jamaica.  When  Charles Long died he left property in Suffolk, a house in Bloomsbury and 14,000 acres of property in Jamaica. His income 'by far the largest enjoyed by any Jamaican proprietor of that period' 16 entitled him to live in splendour.

Planters  and  merchants  both  reaped  vast  profits  from  the  West  Indian trade. The merchants were particularly fortunate. Professor Namier argued that there were 'comparatively few big merchants in Great Britain in 1761 who, in one connection or another, did not trade with the West Indies, and a considerable number of gentry families had interests in the Sugar Islands, just as vast numbers of Englishmen now hold shares in Asiatic rubber or tea plantations or oil fields'. 17 Relations between the two groups however, were not without problems. Planters and merchants belonged to separate organisations. And  in  spite  of  their  common  bond  (credit),  their  interests were,  at  times,  opposed.  The  basic  area  of  conflict  was  the  planters' determination to maintain monopoly prices. In 1793 conflict between them increased considerably as the planters' struggled for a grant of direct trade to Europe.  Ultimately,  as  the  capitalist  class,  their common  interests outweighed their inter-group antagonisms.  About 1780, planters and merchants  combined  in  an  effort  to  defend  their  monopoly  against  the gathering forces of free trade.

In the eighteenth century planters and merchants, working with colonial agents,  became  the  powerful West  India  interest. Together,  they  exploited West  Indian  resources  to  the  hilt,  making  large  fortunes.  To  maintain  the level of profitability in the age of rotten boroughs, the wealth of those with West  Indian  interests  very  often  proved  decisive  during  Parliamentary debates. Votes and rotten boroughs were bought. Once in Parliament their competition (and who could successfully compete against them!) increased the  price  of  seats.  Elections  were  no  longer  foregone  conclusions  for  the

English landed aristocracy. In fact, they were indignant and baffled by the West  Indians  at  elections.  This  was  not  surprising  especially  when  one recalls that in the 1830 elections a West Indian planter was elected in Bristol having spent £18,000. 18 Money, however, could not buy every Parliamentary seat. Nevertheless, a large fortune more often than not was the barometer which measured political power and influence. The Beckford dynasty,  for  example,  was  well-represented  in  Parliament  in  accordance with their wealth. 19 In addition to the Beckfords, Richard Pennant represented  Liverpool,  one  of  the  Barbados  Codringtons  was  an  MP  in 1737,  Edward  Colston  held  the  Bristol  seat  from  1710  to  1713,  George Hibbert  represented  Seaford  from  1806  to  1812  and  John  Gladstone represented Woodstock and, later, Lancaster.

Because of the impulse given to trade and agriculture in England, Henry Goulburn in 1833 was still pleading with Parliament to look at the towns that had sprung up as a consequence of the connection with the colonies. 20 It was difficult to ignore the West Indians; their presence mattered. Ten out of fifteen members of an influential Committee of the Society of Planters and  Merchants  held  seats  in  Parliament. 21 In  effect,  the  slave  traders  and slave-owners were entrenched both in the Commons and in the House of Lords.  From  these  powerful  positions  they  were  able  to  repel  attacks  on their plantations and their social structure. In the balancing act of give and take,  peerages  were  conferred  in  return  for  political  support. There  was  a hard ring of truth in the statement that there were few, if any, noble houses in England without a West Indian.

The slave-owners not only dominated Parliament, but they had an allpervasive  effect  as  aldermen,  mayors  and  councillors.  William  Beckford was  not  only  an  Alderman  for  the  City  of  London,  but  also  twice  Lord Mayor. 22

Nevertheless,  the  West  Indian  interest  was  the 'enfant  terrible of English politics until American Independence struck the first great blow at mercantilism  and  monopoly'. 23   In  1764  there  were  fifty  or  sixty  West Indian  voters  who  held  the  balance  of  power. 24 The  West  Indian  sugar interest  was  enjoying  the  heyday  of  its  power.  But  although  sugar  (and monopoly) would be replaced by cotton (and laissez-faire ) in the eighteenth century,  sugar  remained  supreme  throughout  this  period.  The  vast  profits made  by  the  slave  traders,  slave-owners,  planters  and  merchants  were

openly displayed in England. Indeed, such West Indian wealth courted the displeasure of King George III who, on a visit with Pitt, having encountered a  wealthy  Jamaican  is  reported  to  have  said,  'Sugar,  sugar,  eh?  all that sugar!  How  are  the  duties,  eh,  Pitt,  how  are  the  duties?' 25 Duties  or  no duties, given absentee landlordism, the fact remains that West Indian profits were  spent  in  England.  In  short,  it  was  all  to  the  benefit  of  the  home country.

As the slave trade developed and sugar became King (later succeeded by  cotton  in  the  United  States)  many  Blacks  were  brought  to  the  mother country by their masters; a living reminder of the slavery-profits nexus. On the  question  of  this  fundamental  relationship  two  distinguished  black historians have reached significant conclusions: C. L. R. James suggested in his  history 26 of  the  Haitian  Slave  Revolution  and  the  rise  of  Toussaint L'Ouverture that Britain abolished the slave trade and slavery for economic reasons.  Six  years  later,  Eric  Williams  in Capitalism  and  Slavery 27 also showed how economic rather than humanitarian reasons led to the abolition of  the  slave  trade  and  slavery  in  Britain.  While  few  would  dispute  these conclusions,  logically,  one  might  well  ask:  how  did  the  black  slaves  in Britain live and how did they become 'free'?

## Pets and domestic servants

Before John Hawkins sold his first group of Africans into slavery in 1563, towards the end of 1555, John Lok had already returned from his second voyage bringing to England with him 'certaine black slaves, whereof some were  tall  and  strong  men,  and  could  wel  agree  with  our  meates  and drinkes'. 28 Naturally, the 'colde and moyst' air offended the Africans. This was  the inauspicious beginning  of the importation by  the Merchant Adventurers of Blacks from West Africa into England. Over the next two and  a  half  centuries  the  trade  between  West  Africa,  the  Caribbean,  the Americas  and  England  grew  enormously.  Consequently,  the  number  of Blacks in Britain increased.

The  commercial  probings  of  the  Merchant  Adventurers  opened  up  a new world, the world of the black peoples. Thus from the 1550s, the Blacks became a haunting and focal point of political debate among the ruling class in England. By the late sixteenth century, the Englishman no longer resorted

to reading exotic and fantastic tales about the African. Indeed, the African had become human, a real presence on the streets of English seaports, in London and more particularly, as 'pets' and domestic servants in wealthy English households. 29 Among some members of the English working class, the Black had become an object of envy who, it was argued, did not have to worry  about  the  next  meal. 30 By  the  end  of  the  century,  as  cheap  black labour was sought, there had been a considerable increase in the number of Blacks in England. 31 Initially, these Africans were brought to assist English traders who ventured to Africa. A rare sight, the English were curious about the  black  persons  they  saw.  Indeed,  in  social  circles  they  were  highly valued. Increasingly, black slave domestics became part of noble households. This early contact with West Africans was to have far-reaching consequences.  Queen  Elizabeth  I  gave  her  blessings  to  African  slavetrading,  bestowing  a  knighthood  on  the  slave-trader,  John  Hawkins,  who used  one  of  the  Queen's  ships,  the Jesus on  his  second  slave-trading voyage. 32 As the trade in human cargo between Africa and the New World developed,  more  Africans  arrived  in  England  as  the  property  of  whites, 'human ballast' for sale or to be used at will.

During the first two centuries of black settlement in England, the most common  form  of  work  for  black  workers  was  found  within  the  servant class. 33 As their numbers grew, their employers became less exclusive. By the late sixteenth century, for example, black servants were employed not only close to the Court, but by those of humbler status. 34 Many years later Samuel Johnson's black servant,  Francis  Barber,  was  fortunate  enough  to receive an annual income of £100 after his master's death. This, however, was an exceptional case of good fortune.

Among the Africans, most of whom lived in London (a reflection of the mercantile  importance  of  the  city),  a  few  became  'relatively  prosperous residents'. In fact, a group of Blacks were able to build their own house in London in 1597. 35  Although they did not conform to 'building regulations', they  nevertheless  showed  an  independence  quite  at  variance  with  the received attitude of contemporary Englishmen.

By  the  end  of  the  sixteenth  century,  the  black  presence  had  become noticeable  to  no  lesser  person  than  the  Queen.  The  growth  of  a  black minority in London was, to say the least, assuming the proportions of a real problem. The social problem which faced England, as poverty, famine and

hunger spread over the country, had adverse effects on the Blacks who were singled out for special treatment. Queen Elizabeth alerted the mayors of the major  cities  'that  there  are  of  late  divers  blackamoores  brought  into  this realm, of which  kind of people there are allready here too manie considerynge howe God hath blessed this land with great increase of people of  our  owne  nation  as  anie  countrie  in  the  world'. 36 Accordingly,  she ordered 'that those kinde of people should be sente forth of the land'. In her deportation  order,  she  identified  the  Africans  imported  by  Sir  Thomas Baskerville. 37 She  had  objected  to  black  settlement  in  July  1596  and repatriation was already becoming a preoccupation by the beginning of the seventeenth century. An order was issued to hand over all black servants to the Lubeck merchant, Van Senden, emphasising that Her Majesty's subjects should  'be  served  by  their  owne  countrymen  (rather)  than  those  kind  of people'. 38 The Blacks had become a 'problem' to the extent that in January 1601,  the  Queen  issued  a  proclamation  to  deport  'such  Negroes  and blackamoores which … are carried into this realm … who are fostered and powered here, to the great annoyance of her own liege people'. 39  Already Blacks were being set apart from the rest of the British people. As the slave trade entered into high-gear, in addition to direct importation from Africa, more and more Blacks entered Britain via slavery in the West Indies and in North America where, particularly after the War of Independence, the black slaves who had fought on the British side were promised their freedom.

## Liberty

The presence of black slaves in Britain introduced a new social 'problem'. The ownership of human beings as property was a challenge to the common law. This was reflected in a number of slave cases in which contradictory decisions  were  taken,  indicating  confusion  and  uncertainty  in  the  law.  In 1729, however, in an attempt to clarify any misunderstanding about slaves becoming  free  on  entry  to  England  or  Ireland,  or  as  a  result  of  being baptised,  the  Solicitor-General  and  the  Attorney  General  were  of  the opinion  that  a  slave  coming  from  the  West  Indies  to  Great  Britain  or Ireland,  with  or  without  a  master  was  not  free,  and  that  the  master's property or right in the slave was not thereby determined or varied; and that baptism  did  not  bestow  freedom  on  him  or  made  any  alteration  in  his

temporal  condition.  They  added,  'We  are  also  of  opinion  that  his  master may legally compel him to return again to the plantations.' 40

Known  as  the  Yorke-Talbot  opinion,  this  view  prevailed,  upholding slavery in England until 1772, when the case of the runaway slave Somerset was  heard  in  the  Court  of  King's  Bench  before  Lord  Chief  Justice Mansfield. The case is regarded as a 'watershed' in English legal history. In the case Lord Mansfield effectively decided that a slave could not forcibly be  taken  abroad  by  his  master  against  his  wishes.  The  case  also  had historical significance in showing the positions of contemporary schools of thought on the slave question.

The verdict on the Somerset case was indeed of great significance to the anti-slavery  movement.  In  spite  of  this  decision,  however,  the  practice  of taking slaves forcibly from  England  continued  after 1772.  The law remained  defective,  offering  no  protection  to  the  'free'  black  person  in England  from  unlawful  enslavement.  Slavery  in  the  colonies  then  was  a rude  reminder  to  the  Blacks  of  their  confused  status  in  Britain. As  F.  O. Shyllon  argued,  it  was  not  until  1834  that  it  can  truly  be  said  that  black slaves in Britain were emancipated, as were their fellow Blacks in the West Indies. 41

## Free black voices

Among the 'free' Blacks there were a few who spoke out on the intolerable conditions  of  slavery  and  the  plight  of  the  black  poor  in  Britain.  Having come  'Up  from  Slavery'  in  the  upsurge  of  abolitionist  sentiment  in  the 1780s outstanding contributions came from three Africans, Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano and Olaudah Equiano, amongst others. They were all men of  letters.  Cugoano  and  Equiano  both  wrote  essentially  for  publication, while Sancho was published posthumously. Indeed, Sancho became the best known African in London. He was the author of a book on the theory of music  and  appeared  on  the  stage.  These  talented  Blacks  appealed  to  the liberal instincts of a few distinguished Englishmen. In fact, at this time, the pro-abolition  campaign  to  arouse  British  public  opinion  against  slavery through  petitions  (given  missionary  zeal,  the  growth  of  non-conformism and  humanitarian  agitational  pressure)  had  begun  to  receive  widespread support from radicals and the British working class.

Such men as Garrick and Sterne were among Cugoano's friends, and his portrait was painted by Gainsborough. 42  He was best known, however, for the representations made on behalf of his unfortunate fellow Blacks. In his campaign, he solicited the help of Laurence Sterne by drawing attention to the acute distress of the black poor in London. They needed food, clothing and shelter, and many were desperate and dying he argued. In 1797, in his Thoughts  and  Sentiments Cugoano  denounced  the  evil  of  slavery  and pleaded  for  human  dignity;  for  kindness  and  mercy,  not  transportation  to Sierra  Leone. 43 Moreover,  he  cited  the  appalling  lack  of  consideration  of the British government by elaborating the real difficulties of the ill-advised plan of settlement in West Africa for London's black poor. 44

More  political  than  either  Sancho  or  Cugoano  was  Equiano.  His autobiography, published in 1789, made him famous. 45  He gives a detailed and moving account of how he and his sister were kidnapped in Africa and taken  aboard  a  slave  ship. After  years  in  slavery,  he  was  employed  as  a sailor and gained much experience on vessels plying the Caribbean waters and beyond. He travelled as far as the North Pole.

In  1774  he  set  out  with  Captain  John  Hughes  from  the Thames,  on  a ship  called Anglicania bound  for  Smyrna,  in  Turkey.  On  the  journey  he acted  as  steward  and  John  Annis,  a  'clever  black  man'  was  the  cook. Equiano told how Annis, after two months on board ship was hounded by a Mr.  William  Kirkpatrick,  a  'gentleman'  of  St.  Kitts,  from  whom  he  had parted  by  consent.  Kirkpatrick  nevertheless  sought  to  have Annis  back  in bondage. After several unsuccessful attempts to 'trepan him' (and when all attempts at kidnapping proved abortive) Kirkpatrick with six men and two boats boarded Equiano's ship, tied Annis and forcibly took him away as the crew and the chief mate looked on. This lack of response on the part of the ship's company to retrieve Annis, troubled Equiano. 'I believe', he wrote, 'that  this  was  a  combined  piece  of  business.' 46 And  any  vague  ideas  he might  have  had  about  the  goodness  of  the  Captain  were  now  clearly revealed. He added, 'but, at any rate, it certainly reflected great disgrace on the  mate  and  captain  also,  who,  although  they  had  desired  the  oppressed man to stay on board, yet he did not in the least assist or recover him, or pay me a farthing of his wages, which was about five pounds'. 47  Given his own suffering  and  experience  of  slavery,  and  having  borne  witness  to  the

suffering  of  others,  no  wonder  Equiano  was  moved  to  give  voice  to  the voiceless.

## Enemies and friends

## Enemies

While the black writers pleaded the cause of the slave and the black poor, between  1750  and  1838  the  anti-abolitionists'  arguments  centred  on  the personality traits and physical features of the African slave. Over generations, the prejudice of white racists against the African had imbued the popular consciousness with certain 'characteristic' traits peculiar to the African. A  desperate  anti-Black  campaign  was  mounted  on  behalf  of  the planters' interest to counteract the struggle for black freedom.

In their accounts of slave life and 'scientific observations' of the African in West Africa and the West Indies, bourgeois writers furthered the planters' propaganda. The literary talents of these propagandists were supported by West  Indian  properties  and  metropolitan  interests  that  were  interlocked. Indeed,  the  absentee  planters  offered  their  explanations  (or  prejudices) based on past experiences on the plantations.

Edward Long was one such planter. Born in 1734, he lived in Jamaica for  twelve  years.  His History  of  Jamaica ,  published  in  1774,  became  'a classic description of the machinery of colonial government on the eve of the  American  Revolution'.  Long  certainly  had  strong  views  about  the African. While he must be credited with being outspoken, his feelings about Africans were instructive and must not go unnoticed. In fact, as a respected author,  he  made  'scholarly'  references  to  support  his  arguments,  and  was widely  read  by  a  captive  audience.  In  a  burst  of  unscientific  nonsense, revealing  a  preoccupation  with  black  sexuality,  he  wrote:  'I  do  not  think that  an  orang-outang  husband  would  be  any  dishonour  to  an  Hottentot female for what are these Hottentots?' In describing the Hottentot Black as 'one of the meanest nations on the face of the earth', 48 Long, the successful exploiter of black slaves, betrayed much about himself and his society of British planters. Having  attempted  a  debasement  of  the  black  man's physique to a subhuman level, he went on to insult his intellectual faculties, his diet and eating habits, (and most interestingly) expressed his alarm over their  alleged  sexual  capacity.  'Their  hearing  is  remarkably  quick',  he

observed, adding 'their faculties of smell and taste are truly bestial, nor less so their commerce with the other sex; in these acts they are libidinous and shameless  as  monkies,  or  baboons. The  equally  hot  temperament  of  their women has given probability to the charge of their admitting these animals frequently  to  their  embrace.' 49 So  much  for  Long's  sexual  fantasies!  A pleasure rooted in racism; the oppressor justifying oppression and exploitation through his own weakness?

Another pro-slavery book, a History of the British Colonies in the West Indies ,  was  written  by  Bryan  Edwards in 1793. In recognising the simple fact that the degrading nature of slavery had the effect of conditioning the behaviour of the slaves, he made pronouncements on the morality of sex. Edwards denied that, in reality, the Negro had any 'visions of romance' or capacity for a caring relationship with the opposite sex. 50

Fifty-six years later, The Nigger Question ,  written by Thomas Carlyle, was published. He was particularly abusive and dismissive of Blacks. As far as he was concerned, from his comfortable bourgeois perch, Africans were 'all  very  happy  and  doing  very  well'.  West  Indian  Whites,  on  the  other hand, were unhappy. One might well ask how he arrived at this incredible conclusion. The clue to the answer, it would seem, is in the fact that this relative concern  over  the  slave/white  relationship  in  the  West  Indies afforded  him  the  opportunity  of  a  larger  bone  to  pick  nearer  home.  He contrasted the impoverished Whites with the Blacks thus:

But,  thank  Heaven,  our  interesting  Black  population  -  equalling almost in number of heads one of the Ridings of Yorkshire, and in worth (in quantity of intellect, faculty, docility, energy, and available human valor and value) perhaps one of the streets of Seven Dials are  all  doing  remarkably  well.  'Sweet  blighted  lillies'  -  as  the American epitaph on the Nigger child has it - Sweet blighted lillies, they are holding up their heads again! How pleasant, in the universal bankruptcy  abroad,  and  dim  dreary  stagnancy  at  home,  as  if  for England too there remained nothing but to suppress Chartist riots, banish  united  Irishmen,  vote  the  supplies,  and  wait  with  arms crossed till black Anarchy and Social Death devoured us also; as it has  done  the  others;  how  pleasant  to  have  always  this  fact  to  fall back upon: our beautiful Black darlings are at last happy; with little

labour  except  to  the  teeth,  which  surely,  in  those  excellent  horsejaws of theirs, will not fail! 51

He saw oppressed Blacks and Whites as being forced by hunger to labour for their living and feared that an emancipated West Indies would be turned into a 'Black Ireland'. Further, he likened such a reality to be stronger than a nightmare dream. 52 He refused to explore the question of African rights. And with a facile consideration, he excused himself from further discussion by saying what 'a complex' thing it was.

In 1859, Anthony Trollope joined the chorus of racist writers with the publication The  West  Indies  and  the  Spanish  Main . He,  too,  showed  a preoccupation with 'the black skin and thick lip' of the 'Negro', drawing a distinction between that strange race of creole 'Negroes' born out of Africa and those born within. He derided the black slave for having 'no language of  their  own'  and  for  speaking  'broken  English'  as  uneducated  foreigners always speak a foreign language. The lack of educational opportunities was the farthest thing from his mind. In fact, his view of the African was that he was capable of the hardest physical work which could be endured 'probably with  less  bodily  pain  than  men  of  any  other  race'.  Nonetheless,  he  was 'idle, unambitious as to worldly position, sensual, and content with little'. 53 This was his raison d'être for not educating the black man who was forced to eke out the barest existence, yet was seen as being 'content with little'! Trollope  bowed  to  the  deity  of  profits,  emphasising  his  concern  for competition and the labour market. One might well ask, what indeed did the rich planters and merchants (whom Trollope and others have so staunchly defended) give in return for the vast profits they reaped at the expense of the cheap, mercilessly exploited labour of generations of enslaved Blacks?

The  slave  trade  and  Negro  slavery  had  been  a  matter  of  conscience  for many English philanthropists who sought to educate public opinion about the  black  slave.  The  pro-planters  and  merchants  lobby  had  to  face  a countervailing  force  described  as  'The  Humanitarian  Impulse'.  Granville Sharp, one of the guiding lights among the philanthropists gave shape and direction to the humanitarian movement. He was in close contact with the slaves in London and became controversial in dealing with their problems. In  1765,  he  rescued  an  ill-used  slave  Jonathan  Strong,  who  in  1769  was

recaptured  and  jailed.  Sharp's  determination  in  rescuing  him  again  was followed by Strong's 'owner' David Lisle taking legal action against Sharp whose  lawyers  advised  him  that  because  of  the  Yorke-Talbot  opinion  of 1729,  Lisle  had  a  strong  legal  case.  Not  to  be  outdone,  Sharp  undertook research to prove that slavery in England was unlawful. In 1769 the result of  his  research, A  Representation  of  the  Injustice …  was  published.  His fight against English slavery was rewarded with the famous judgement on the  Somerset  case  in  1772.  Throughout  the  case,  Sharp  played  a  crucial role, directing popular attention to the illegality of slavery in England. This case was used as a platform for political organisation and propaganda in the campaign for abolition and emancipation.

John Wesley also rallied crucial support for the philanthropist cause. In Thoughts Upon Slavery , published in 1774, he attacked British involvement in slave trading. This publication had a huge circulation in the 1780s. It was influential  in  turning  the  growing  body  of  Methodists  against  the  slave trade. Moreover, it led to extensive missionary work in the West Indies. His description of the Negro helped to restore a 'human image' which played an important part in the campaign of the abolitionist cause.

Another influential campaigner against the evils of slavery was James Ramsay. His decision to do so was the result of a visit to a disease-ridden slave ship and the appalling treatment meted out to the slaves. He took Holy Orders and became a missionary in the West Indies. His involvement with the  slaves  brought  inevitable  displeasure  to  the  planters.  This  experience served him well. On his return to England, Ramsay wrote his Essay on the Treatment  and  Conversion  of  African  Slaves . He  worked  together  with William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson and the abolitionist Quakers.

Thomas  Clarkson,  regarded  as  the  greatest  of  all  the  abolitionists, undertook the demanding and dangerous task of gathering evidence (from the  slave  traders  themselves)  against  the  slave  trade.  As  a  student  at Cambridge, his prize-winning Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species was first published in 1785. This aroused a wave of public indignation  against  the  slave-traders.  Further,  it  evoked  sympathy  for  the slave  that  was  'never  to  be  surpassed'.  And  after  Henri  Christophe  (the King  of  Haiti)  died,  his  wife  and  daughter  stayed  with  the  Clarksons. Clarkson's friend, the poet William  Wordsworth  (who  also  went  to Cambridge), aware of Clarkson's essay on slavery, recognised both Toussaint L'Ouverture and Clarkson in the following sonnets:

Toussaint, the most unhappy man of men! Whether the Whistling Rustic tends his plough Within thy hearing, or thy head be now Pillowed in some deep dungeon's earless den; O miserable Chieftain! Where and when Wilt thou find patience! Yet die not; do thou Wear rather in thy bonds a cheerful brow: Though fallen thyself, never to rise again, Live and take comfort. Thou hast left behind Powers that will work for thee; air, earth, and skies; There's not a breathing of the common wind That will forget thee: thou has great allies; Thy friends are exultations, agonies, And love, and man's unconquerable mind. 54

On the final passing of the Bill  for  the  abolition  of  the  slave  trade  in March 1807, he wrote:

Clarkson! it was an obstinate hill to climb: How toilsome - nay, how dire - it was, by thee Is known; by none, perhaps, so feelingly: But thou, who starting in thy fervent prime, Didst first lead forth that enterprise sublime, Hast heard the constant voice its charge repeat, Which, out of thy young heart's oracular seat, First roused thee - O true yorke-fellow of Time, Duty's intrepid liegeman, see, the palm Is won, and by all Nations shall be worn! The blood-stained Writing is forever torn; And thou henceforth will have a good man's calm, A great man's happiness; thy zeal shall find Repose at length, firm friend of human kind! 55

In Letters  on  Slavery ,  published  in  1789, William Dickson challenged the widespread belief in the inferiority of black men. He too had first hand experience of the debilitating effects of life on the plantations in Barbados. He pointed out that planters failed to see that the qualities they complained of  in  the  slave  stemmed  directly  from  the  life  to  which  the  slaves  were subjected.

Finally, we turn to the activities of William Wilberforce. His struggle in the  cause  of  emancipation  was  spread  over  half  a  century.  Like  Granville Sharp,  Wilberforce  was  involved  at  every  level  in  the  campaign  for  the abolition  of  slavery,  from  the  late  1780s  to  the  time  of  his  death  before Emancipation.  Against  the  impression  created  by  the  planters  and  their influential  apologists,  'that  the  indolence  of  the  Negro  race  was  utterly

incurable,  and  that  without  the  driving  whip  they  never  would  willingly engage in agricultural labour', Wilberforce argued that it has been 'shown to  be  utterly  without  foundation'.  Among  others,  he  cited  a  'striking instance'  in  Trinidad  where  the  many  hundreds  of American  'Negroes'  at the  close  of  'the  late  unhappy  war  with  the  United  States,  were,  by  the humane policy of Sir Ralph Woodford, received into Trinidad, to no small alarm  to  the  planters'. 56 Wilber-force's  overall  contribution  to  end  the system  of  slavery  has  become  well-known.  What  is  less  well  known, however, is his highly questionable position as a 'humanitarian'.

Following Carlyle's 'Discourse', John Stuart Mill entered the debate on the 'Negro' question in 1850. Despite the collapse of the sugar producing colonies, his overall argument in support of black freedom is interesting. He wrote:

Were the whites born ever so superior in intelligence to the blacks, and competent by nature to instruct and advise them, it would not be the less monstrous to assert that they had therefore a right either to subdue  them  by  force,  or  circumvent  them  by  superior  skill;  to throw  upon  them  the  toils  and  hardships  of  life,  reserving  for themselves,  under  the  misapplied  name  of  work,  its  agreeable excitements. … That this country should turn back to the matter of Negro  slavery,  I  have  not  the  smallest  apprehension.  There  is, however, another place where that tyranny still flourishes, but now for  the  first  time  finds  itself  seriously  in  danger.  At  this  crisis  of American  slavery,  when  the  decisive  conflict  between  right  and iniquity  seems  about  to  commence,  your  contributor  steps  in,  and flings this missile, loaded with the weight of his reputation, into the abolitionist  camp.  The  words  of  English  writers  of  celebrity  are words of power on the other side of the ocean; and the owners of human flesh, who probably thought they had not an honest man on their  side  between the Atlantic and the Vistula, will welcome such an auxiliary. Circulated as his dissertation will probably be by those whose interests profit by it, from one end of the American Union to the other, I hardly know of an act by which one person could have done so much mischief as this may possibly do; and I hold that by thus  acting,  he  has  made  himself  an  instrument  of  what  an  able writer in the Inquirer justly calls 'a true work of the devil'. 57

In the long debate between the 'enemies' and 'friends' (whose arguments weighed in the balance the future of the slaves) the bedrock of the  slave  system  remained  its  economic  viability.  Taking  the  issue  from there,  the  struggle  was  strengthened  by  winning  public  opinion.  For  as Walvin  argued:  'What  ultimately  doomed  slavery  was  the  anti-slavery movement  and  the  irresistible  pressure  it  exercised  via  the  public,  over Parliament  and  Governments'. 58   Indeed,  it  was  clear  that  this  economic issue with all its political implications would  only be resolved by Parliament.

## The struggle of the black poor

The black people living in England during these years were engaged in a daily struggle  for survival.  Apart  from  being  'alien',  their blackness emphasised  their  conspicuousness.  The  grim  reality  of  poverty  pushed many  to  desperation.  They  fought  on  two  main  fronts;  some  became political activists and some pugilists.

The  fight  for  survival  was  the  essential  experience  of  the  black  poor. Street life bred the art of self-defence but most of the black poor were the victims of adverse circumstances. Blacks were abused indiscriminately.

Those  born  or  brought  to  Britain  were  treated,  to  say  the  least, indecently. In short, many in the 'circus' were displayed like animals.

Poverty  was,  in  general,  synonymous  with  being  black.  The  black  poor were  among  the  'poorest  of  the  poor' in London.  Not  surprisingly, therefore,  a  large  proportion  of  London's  black  poor  were  beggars  in  the mid-1780s  and  during  the  nineteenth  century.  It  seemed  wherever  there were beggars, black people were among them. According to the Society for the Suppression of Mendicity, there were approximately 400 black beggars between 1820 and 1826, a ratio of one in every 40 beggars. 59

Barely  eking  out  an  existence  (and  in  many  cases  close  to  death)  the gradual decline in black beggary reflected a decline in the black population as a whole due to a high death rate in London and the fact that there was little fresh immigration. 60

Given that remunerative employment was hard to come by, many blacks had  to  live  by  their  wits.  Necessity  being  the  mother  of  invention,  some

mendicant Blacks were able to elude the Society's strictures. One important reason  for  keeping  out  of  reach  of  the  Society  was  the  severe  treatment Blacks received. Inevitably, some Blacks were caught and punished as were a Jamaican and a Barbadian in 1819 and 1820 respectively. 61

Deportation of Blacks loomed large as the final answer. Financing such a remedy was clearly no problem. (This was attempted earlier in the 1780s when the black poor were deported to Sierra Leone.) But deportation to the West Indies meant slavery. Blacks were caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, hunger and poverty forced them to beg and steal, while on the other, they  were  faced  with  the  possibility  of  deportation  and  slavery.  By  all accounts  then,  the  position  of  the  black  poor  in  English  society  was  a desperate  one.  Cornered  like  animals,  they  had  to  fight  for  the  barest existence.

As  they  fought  in  the  boxing  ring,  or  on  the  streets,  or  against prosecutions,  at  various  times,  they  faced  the  real  possibility  of  being imprisoned, flogged or deported.

Given  the  difficulties,  not  many  Blacks  were  prepared  to  remain beggars. Many, however, seemed to have begged at one time or another. A few who 'turned professional' did well enough to become heroes. Tribute was paid to these outstanding beggars by their peers. The black one-legged fiddler,  Billy  Waters,  was  elected  'King  of  the  Beggars'. 62 Another  wellknown 'successful' black beggar 63  was Charles McGee. Born in Jamaica in 1744 he begged at Ludgate Hill.

In the fight for survival, another section of the black community - the Lascars - were faced also with extreme hardship. The Lascars in London were Indian seamen. These men, who found England cold and inhospitable, managed to join the professional beggars.

From 1814, about 1500 Lascars living in barracks received support from the East India Company. 64  In fact, the Company paid 1 . 6 s d . a day for their board and lodging. 65 In spite of this gesture, an estimated 130 Lascars died in Britain each year from 1790 to 1810. This death rate doubled in 1813. In the winter of 1813-14, the Company admitted that at least two Lascars died each week and, on one exceptionally cold day, five died. 66 Naturally, these men  complained  at  the  treatment  they  were  receiving.  The  Company responded  predictably.  The  grumblers  were  to  be  deported  on  the  first ship. 67 In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  Lascars'  grievances  were  many,  once

again repatriation was used as the ultimate threat. But such threats were no solutions  to  the  problems  of  the  black  poor.  A  Parliamentary  Committee found that men slept on bare planks on the floor and that the barracks were often overcrowded.

Moreover, the Company openly admitted that the men in their care were the victims of acts of violence by the administrators. 68 The missionaries and magistrates showed little sympathy or understanding for the Indian seamen or  their  religious  beliefs.  But  of  course,  tolerance  was  never  enough. Racism lurked everywhere. A dark complexion was clearly objectionable. And when members and friends of the African and Asiatic Society met for dinner at a Tavern in 1816 (even with the humanitarian and friend of the Blacks Wilberforce acting as Chairman) tokenism and discrimination was seen very clearly. 69 Alas, such gross prejudice did not prevent intermarriage. Of the estimated 10,000 black people living in Britain at the beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century,  many  black  males  had  taken  white wives.

According to Peter Fryer, while black immigration to Britain dwindled, intermarriage was widespread. Consequently, these two factors contributed to a decrease (how large would be pure guesswork) of the black community during the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, there was a continuous black presence. In Liverpool (the slave port and centre of the cotton trade) research has shown that there never was a time, throughout the century,  when  the  city  did  not  have  black  citizens  and  that  these  citizens were always united by common problems and interests. 70

Despite a decrease in the number of the black poor in Britain during the nineteenth century, their essential poverty remained unaffected. So much so, that  action  of  another  kind  became  necessary;  action  based  on  common causes shared to some extent by the wider British working class.

## 2 Black Radicals and Black Women in Service

Common  problems  and  common  interests  indeed.  Through  aiding  the common  causes,  by  the  turn  of  the  nineteenth  century  the  anti-slavery campaign, in church and chapel and especially among the British working class (although there is evidence during the early 1830s of radical working class hostility) won steadily growing support. In fact, the mass anti-slavery movement  emerged  at  the  end  of  the  1780s,  reaching  peaks  in  the campaigns  for  abolition  of  the  Slave  Trade  (1788,  1792  and  1814),  for Emancipation (1823, 1830 and 1833) and for the end of 'Negro' Apprenticeship in 1838. 1

Paradoxically, in spite of this shift in British public opinion, the black people in Britain were, in various ways, forced to submit to the prejudices inherent in English society, as their fellow Blacks endured the agonies of slavery  on  the  colonial  plantations.  Significantly,  the  black  struggle  had merged  into  a  larger  movement,  with  the  black  slave  being  used  as  an argument  against  white  slavery  in  Britain.  Not  surprisingly  then,  black working class leaders were acceptable and became an integral part of the vanguard of the radical working class movement between 1800 and 1850. During  this  period,  four  exceptional  Blacks  emerged  to  channel  their

particular grievances and arguments into the mainstream of British working class  agitation.  Two  of  them,  William  Davidson  and  Robert  Wedderburn, were revolutionary socialists. They were 'members of the far left of all the radical organisations of the time', and  followers of Thomas  Spence (Secretary  of  the  London  Corresponding  Society  (LCS)  and  editor  of radical papers), who was imprisoned for his radicalism.

It is more than likely that, apart from the fact that the Spenceans were the 'farthest left of the radicals', these black radicals were also attracted to their  group  which  was  the  'most  solidly  working  class  in  composition'. Most of its members were 'mechanics and manufacturers', factory workers and shoemakers and a few soldiers and sailors. The small numbers of its membership did not detract from the quality of their group which was the only radical organisation to maintain an unbroken continuity throughout the Napoleonic wars. 2

The Spenceans, the only socialist  organisation  in  the  country,  had  the reputation of being 'the most serious, and influential group of conspirators during the post-war radical agitation'.  Spencean activists were involved in 3 the Spa Fields riots in December 1816 and some of them had contacts in Manchester,  Stockport  and  Bolton.  In  terms  of  formal  organisation,  the Spenceans were divided into sections, structurally similar to that of the old LCS.  This  influence  on  the  Spenceans  was  not  surprising  since  the  last Secretary of the LCS was Thomas Evans* (a colourer of prints and later, patent  brace-maker) 4 who  became  leader  of  the  Spenceans  after  Spence's death  in  1814.   Inevitably,  the  splits 5 and  disharmony  led  to  various Spencean  groups  operating  along  independent  lines  during  1817-1820. Robert  Wedderburn  led  one  of  these  groups  while  William  Davidson  led another.  The  other  outstanding  black  radical  devoted  to  the  British  and colonial working class struggle was the deported London Chartist, William Cuffay.  Lesser  known  (and  understandably)  is  Matthew  Bogle  who  was involved in the Scottish Insurrection of 1820.

## Robert Wedderburn

The  English  working  class  had,  by  the  early  nineteenth  century,  become sufficiently aware that their freedom was crucially dependent on their own forms of agitational organisation. Like the slaves on the colonial

plantations, they could not wait for 'a dispensation from above'. Those who followed  the  radical  tradition  risked  everything;  ultimately,  their  lives. Prison sentences were served on those who challenged the ruling class on political, religious or trade union matters, for example. Although there were 26 prosecutions for seditious and blasphemous libel in 1817, radicals of all shades  of  opinion  were  united  in  one  aim:  to  bait  authority  until  certain freedoms were won. Among the black radicals was Robert Wedderburn. A tailor  by  trade  and  leader  of  a  London-based  Spencean  Group,  he  had printed The  Forlorn  Hope .  Seen  as  a  threat  to  the  ruling  class,  he  was imprisoned.

This black man had come a long way to join the working class struggle in  Britain.  Wedderburn's  mother  was  a  slave  in  Jamaica.  His  father  was James Wedderburn, a Scot who owned large sugar plantations in Jamaica. 6 What we know is that Robert was born in Jamaica in 1762  and brought up 7 by  his  grandmother.  As  a  child  he  bore  witness  to  both  his  mother  and grandmother being flogged. This had a profound effect upon Robert. 8

A  witness  to  many  atrocities,  Wedderburn,  a  lad  of  17,  arrived  in England  in  1778.  His  first  employment  was  at  sea,  before  becoming  a jobbing tailor. He was aware during his life, particularly in England, of the great divide between rich and poor, and the importance of social status in English society. He had begun to see much of his earlier life in historical perspective. Prejudice and social injustice in his workaday experiences had sharpened his perception and honed his intelligence to a militant edge. He felt  his  earlier  work  experience could have been better.  Indeed, he was a 9 social man. Having heard a Wesleyan preacher at Seven Dials, he sought to relate fringe groups like Armenians, unorthodox Christians, Calvinists and Unitarians  with  the  rest  of  the  Christian  flock.  Togetherness,  brotherhood and  unity  was  superficial.  He  wanted  to  get  to  the  heart  of  the  Christian religion.  He  became  a  Unitarian  preacher  which  acted  as  a  cover  for  his radical  activities.  Thus,  he  became  'Reverend'  Robert  Wedderburn.  His work  as  a  Unitarian  preacher  proved  fruitful.  His  findings  in  a  pamphlet Truth,  self-supported;  or  a  refutation  of  certain  doctrinal  errors,  generally adopted in the Christian church, led him on to unorthodox directions. A few months  before  Thomas  Spence  died,  Wedderburn  came  into  contact  with him. Wedderburn was then about 51 or 52 years old. In fact, Wedderburn became a member of the Society of Spencean Philanthropists.

Wedderburn's  activities  in  the  Spencean  group  became  prominent  in March  1817  with  Parliamentary  legislation  aimed  at  suppressing  the Spenceans. Following the Act, Thomas Evans, the Spencean leader, and his young son were imprisoned for high treason, for publishing anti-landowners views. Wedderburn was now in the front line. In an effort to arouse English workers  from  their  lethargy,  he  launched  in  1817 The  Forlorn  Hope ,  a periodical through which he hoped 'to establish something of a free Press'. He used the first issue to appeal for help on behalf of Evans and his son. This  was  a  clever  move  designed  not  only  to  draw  out  those  who  were supporters of Evans, but also an attempt to establish the principle of a free press.

Among the radicals leadership was a quarrelsome issue. On his release from  jail,  Evans  clashed  with  Wedderburn.  Young  people  approved  of Wedderburn's  teachings,  applauding  'anything  that  he  ridiculed  in  the Scriptures most violent'. 10 He was sensitive about his African ancestry and was pleased with the decision of a debate concerning the right of a slave to kill  his  master. This  outcome in favour of slaves freeing themselves from their  Christian  masters  was  widely  welcomed.  Wedderburn's  undoubted influence led to his prosecution for 'sedition and blasphemy'.

Soon  after  Wedderburn's  incarceration,  the  Peterloo  massacre  took place.  The  factory  owners,  merchants  and  shopkeepers  in  Manchester, amassed  their  strength  against  a  defenceless  working  class.  The  violence and enormity of events of Peterloo and its implications were the subject of political debates and discussions on 'class war' throughout the country. 11

In Wedderburn's view the revolution was imminent. The ministers and Prince  Regent,  he  said,  were  'bloody  tyrants'.  There  were  no  two  ways about it. His commitment to the revolution was clear. He was 60, and three years  earlier he  had  engaged  in  physical  training  in  readiness  for  a confrontation with and the eventual overthrow of 'those bloody murdering thieves'. 12 He had an abiding faith in 'the poor' emerging victorious.

Given  his  Jamaican  background,  Wedderburn  was  able  to  put  in perspective the English working class struggle in the context of the Empire. As  Fryer  correctly  states,  he  was  the  first  black  activist  to  disseminate revolutionary writings from Britain in the West Indies. While urging slaves to  acquire  lands,  Wedderburn  felt  the  plight  of  White  European  poor  and Black slaves integral to the revolutionary struggle.

By the 1820s, Spenceanism had given precedence to the National Union of Working Classes, and other organisations in the early 1830s. Indeed, the ideas of Spence, were highly influential on the Socialist theories of Robert Owen. Moreover, old Spenceans played an 'important and continuous' role in London Chartism. 13  How did Wedderburn figure in these movements?

Little is known about the rest of his life, and the date and circumstances of his death, but one thing shines through in his life: the son of a slave, he was  unwilling  to  accept  slavery  in  any  form,  either  among  the  English working class or the slaves on the plantations. The class struggle was his main concern; race and colour, it seemed, were secondary. His commitment to  the  class  war  was  uncompromising.  Though  incarcerated  twice  for  his beliefs, criticised by fellow working  class leaders and spied on by informers, this black radical's revolutionary fervour on behalf of the poor and oppressed remained uncompromised. This kind of commitment resulted in the role of the Spenceans being an important and continuous one. Indeed, Spenceanism survived as a revolutionary idea in radical politics long after it ceased to function as an organised party.

## William Davidson

Born  in  1786,  William  Davidson  came  to  England  from  Jamaica. 14 Like Wedderburn,  Davidson  was  the  offspring  of  a  black  woman  and  a  white man. His father was 'Mr Attorney General Davidson', a man of considerable legal knowledge and talent, who  had several children. William, his second son, was sent to England at an early age to be educated at  a  level  suited  to  the  rank  of  his  father  and  to  further  his  own  career prospects.  In  spite  of  his  mother's  opposition  to  her  son  being  sent  to England, his father's mind was made up: he should proceed to study law.

After study and a stint at sea, Davidson became a cabinet-maker. He had read  and  supported  the  ideas  of  Thomas  Paine 15 and  had  joined  the Marylebone  Union  Reading  Society,  formed  as  a  direct  result  of  the Peterloo massacre. Like Wedderburn in his Hopkins Street chapel, Davidson  called  meetings  which  were  held  in  his  house.  Davidson's associates  and  activities  (and  his  colour)  singled  him  out  for  special surveillance.  He  was  introduced  to  George  Edwards  by  the  radical  John Harrison. Edwards, (a 'modeller of statuettes' by trade) posed as a radical to

deflect attention from his double role of police spy and agent provocateur . 16

In the deliberations  over  an  uprising  or  attempts  to  dislodge  the government,  Edwards  was  not  short  of  plans  for  dealing  with  guilty government officials. He suggested that the House of Commons should be blown  up.  This,  among  other  plans,  was  rejected  by  the  radical  leader Arthur Thistlewood on the ground that the innocent should not 'suffer with the  guilty'. As  it  happened,  an  opportunity  approximating  something they were  waiting  for  presented  itself.  It  was  announced  that  the  Cabinet  as  a whole  would  be  dining  at  Lord  Harrowby's  house  in  Grosvenor  Square. Davidson had worked for a time for Lord Harrowby who described him as 'a damned seditious fellow'. 17

The  group's  plan  was  to  kill  all  the  ministers  as  they  dined  together. This, they hoped would initiate an insurrection and lead to the formation of a  provisional  government.  Edwards'  double-dealing  had  begun  to  affect Thistlewood and his supporters who agreed to 'every detail' of a plan he suggested.

Thistlewood's group delegated to Davidson the responsibility of raising money and buying weapons at a time when working men in various parts of the  country  were  arming  to  defend  themselves  against  further  attacks  on radical  demonstrations.  Moreover,  the  group  relied  on  Davidson  to  guard their  home-made  grenades,  muskets,  pistols,  etc.  which  were  kept  in  the Cato Street loft, near Edgeware Road. Uncannily, the loft was pounced on by  police  as  the  group  made  its  final  deliberations  before  setting  out  for Grosvenor Square. In the shouting and scuffling that ensued, Thistlewood stabbed  a  policeman  to  death  and  fled.  His  escape  was  however,  only temporary.  He  was  arrested  the  next  day  at  his  hiding  place  which  was known to the spy Edwards.

As it  was,  the  long-awaited  insurrection  in  London  did  not  eventuate. Elsewhere in Barnsley, Huddersfield and Sheffield insurrections failed. In Glasgow  and  Paisley  however,  about  60,000  weavers  went  on  'spyfomented'  strike. 18 And  in  the  Battle  of  Bonnymuir  during  the  Scottish Insurrection  the  radicals  were  defeated. 19 The  spy  Alexander  Richmond played  a  key  role  in  the  downfall  of  the  Scottish  Radical  Movement. Thereafter, the Movement collapsed.

In  the  aftermath  Thistlewood,  Davidson  and  their  three  companions were put on trial for high treason. Davidson pleaded not guilty and when he suggested his colour might lead to his conviction, one of the Judges said: 'God forbid that the complexion of the accused should enter, for a single moment, into  the  consideration  of  the  jury.' 20 In  his  defence,  he  told  the Court  that although  his  house  had  been  ransacked,  no  incriminating evidence  had  been  found.  This  was  supported  by  a  Bow  Street  constable who reported that Davidson's 'Hovel' was carefully searched. 21

The five men accused in the Cato Street conspiracy were all sentenced to be hanged early on the morning of 1 May 1820.

The dream of revolution harboured by these desperate men had failed miserably.  Indeed,  the  legend  on  the  banner  (a  black  flag  with  skull  and cross-bones)  which  Davidson  guarded  from  capture  by  the  police  was  a fitting epitaph, 'Let us die like men and not be sold like slaves.' 22

## William Cuffay

Like Wedderburn and Davidson, William Cuffay (called Cuffey, Cuffy and Coffey) stood out among his contemporaries in the English working class movement and was penalised for his activities and political beliefs.

His grandfather, like so many Africans, was a slave on the plantations in St  Kitts.  His  father,  apparently  a  free  man,  brought  the  family  to  Britain when Cuffay was a child. William grew up with his mother and sister.

There  is  uncertainty  as  to  when  Cuffay  first  became  active  in  the working class movement. He 'disapproved of the Trades Union Movement in  1834,  and  was  nearly  the  last  of  his  Society  in  joining  the  lodge'. 23 It must not be presumed however, that this reference to the Owenite Grand National Consolidated Trade Union and Cuffay's hostility to it, extended to trade  unionism  as  such.  In  fact,  Cuffay  went  on  strike  with  his  fellow members. As  a  result  of  this  involvement,  he  lost  a  shop  where  he  had worked for many years, thereafter finding it very difficult to get a job. With the  difficulties  of  unemployment,  the  die  was  cast;  the  direction  already charted.

Cuffay joined the Chartist Movement in 1839 and became prominent in the London leadership. In October 1839 he helped to form the Metropolitan Tailors'  Charter  Association,  which  recruited  80  members  on  the  first

night. 24 He supported the People's Charter, drawn up by the cabinet-maker, William  Lovett,  and  Francis  Place,  demanding  universal  male  suffrage, annual  parliaments,  vote  by  secret  ballot,  payment  of  MPs,  abolition  of property qualifications for MPs, and equal electoral districts.

Cuffay emerged as one of the dozen or so most prominent leaders of the Chartist  movement  in  London.  The  Chartists  in  London  were  essentially artisans.  In  fact,  Chartism  in  London  was,  'a  sustained  movement  which produced its own leaders, stuck to its traditional radicalism yet worked out its own class attitudes'. 25

Within this movement Cuffay's popularity grew. In 1841 he was elected delegate  for  Westminster  to  the  Metropolitan  Delegate  Council. 26 A  few months later, in 1842 when George Julian Harney and other national leaders were arrested, the Council appointed Cuffay, together with Morgan, Dron and Knight to form an 'interim executive.' 27

Cuffay, the tiny tailor, during his Chartist years was always among the most  militant  of  his  contemporaries.  In  the  mid-1840s  he  advocated  the interruption of the middle class Complete Suffrage Meetings and Anti-Corn Law  demonstrations.  As  expected,  the  press  singled  him  out  for  his militancy  and  his  intransigence.  There  was  no  doubt  about  Cuffay's influence  among  London  Chartists.  Indeed, The  Times had  referred  to London Chartists as 'the black man and his party'. 28 This bad press led to Cuffay's wife losing her job as a charwoman. 29 The ruling class had to have their  scapegoat,  but  their  sneering  attacks  could  not  deflect  the  onward march of this black radical leader, who went from strength to strength in his representation  of  an  important  section  of  the  English  working  class.  His stature  was  such  that  by  1844  he  was  a  member  of  the  Masters'  and Servants' Bill Demonstration Committee. 30  In this capacity he was opposed to the power vested in magistrates to imprison a neglectful worker for two months on his employer's oath. To the poor working man this was indeed adding salt to the wound. One of those who fought against the Bill was the radical MP Thomas Slings by Duncombe, who saw it as 'one of the most insidious, oppressive, arbitrary, iniquitous and tyrannical attempts to oppress the working classes. 31 Support of this kind (few and far between) was vital in the working class struggle and needed to be recognised. Cuffay, the  Tailors'  delegate,  was  among  those  who  met  to  arrange  a  soirée  for Duncombe in support of his fight against the Bill.

On other issues  such  as  the  Chartist  Land  Plan,  Cuffay  was  always  a vigorous supporter, representing London at the Manchester Conference in 1845. In essence the Plan was to 'take the unemployed out of the slums and allocate to each family two acres of good arable land'. His life as a Chartist leader was hectic. In 1846 he served as one of three London delegates to the Birmingham  Land  Conference,  and  was  an  auditor  to  the  National  Land Company. He held this position until his arrest. He was also one of the ten directors  of  the  National  Anti-Militia  Association  and  a  member  of  the Democratic Committee for Poland's Regeneration. In 1847, Cuffay was on the Central Registration and Election Committee, and in 1848 he sat on the management Committee for a Metropolitan Democratic Hall. 32

The  year  1848  was  significant  for  Cuffay.  He  was  a  London  Chartist delegate to the National Convention which opened at the Literary Institution  in  Fitzroy  Square,  on  the  morning  of  Tuesday  4  April  1848. Whatever  of  value  Cuffay  might  have  learned  from  past  experience,  he intended to adopt. From the outset he took a hard line. His militancy left no room for flexibility. He was suspicious of opportunists. He questioned G. W.  M.  Reynolds'  standing  as  a  Chartist,  and  totally  opposed  granting credentials to Charles  McCarthy  of  the  Irish  Democratic  Federation. Eventually, the McCarthy dispute was settled.

During  the  Convention,  Cuffay's  militancy  was  in  the  ascendant.  The Convention's  main  concern  was  to  call  a  mass  meeting  on  Kennington Common and a procession that would take the Chartist petition of almost two  million  signatures to the House  of  Commons.  Cuffay  seconded Reynolds' amendment 'That in the event of the rejection of the Petition the Convention  should  declare  its  sitting  permanent  and  should  declare  the Charter the law of the land', 33 and expressed opposition to a body declaring itself permanent that represented only a fraction of the people. However, he directed  the  Convention's  attention  to  presenting  the  petition,  and  that  a National Assembly be called instead. In due course the idea of a National Assembly was accepted.

Cuffay's  militant  stand  at  the  Convention  could  not  accommodate moderation. When the Committee for managing the procession was set up, Cuffay was appointed Chairman.

Significantly,  Cuffay,  the  militant  Chartist  organiser  was  no  hot-head. His  sense  of  responsibility  came  through.  In  the  'crisis',  he  expected

Chartists to act with cool determination. Cuffay was ahead of the Executive which  had  'shrunk  from  their  responsibility'.  Their  lack  of  spirit  did  not inspire confidence in those who would follow them.

The procession was declared illegal by the Commissioner of Police, and the Queen journeyed to the Isle of Wight in search of safety. In defence of their class interests, lawyers, shop-keepers and government clerks, volunteered  as  special  constables.  Seven  thousand  soldiers  were  detailed along the Embankment and 'heavy gun batteries' were deployed. Thousands of police were drafted in to guard the sealed-off bridges. 34 This impressive, intimidating show of force had the desired effect.

The  Commissioner  of  Police  who  interviewed  O'Connor,  the  Irish confederates' leader, said he had never seen a more frightened man. After this interview,  O'Connor  decided,  at  that  advanced  stage,  to  end  the procession.  When  this  decision  reached  the  large  crowd  assembled  at Kennington Common it was met with anger.

At the forefront of those who protested was Cuffay who was opposed to O'Connor and the platform's abandonment of the procession to Parliament. He  recognised  the  stupidity  of  congregating  south  of  the  river,  with  the bridges under complete control of the police and the military, and he spoke in  the  strongest  language  against  O'Connor. 35 He  regarded  the  whole Convention as a set of 'cowardly humbugs' with whom he did not ever wish to be associated. He then left the vehicle he was in and joined the crowd. He told the crowd that O'Connor must have known all this before and that he ought to have informed them of it so they could have taken the petition at once to  the  House  of  Commons,  without  crossing  the  bridges. As  it  was, they were completely trapped. 36

This  defeat  was  a  severe  blow  which  Cuffay  would  not  forgive  or forget. When he was elected as one of the Commissioners to promote the campaign for the Charter following its rejection by Parliament, he saw an uprising as the only way forward. Insurrection being preached by a black man in England was indeed anathema. But, the question arises, was Cuffay the instigator? According to one historian, although Cuffay was secretary of the 'Ulterior Committee' on 16 August, he had only occupied that post since the  13th  of  that  month.  Indeed,  the  'true  leaders'  and  originators  of  the revolutionary attempt were Payne, Mullins, John Rose, Brewster and James Bassett. 37 To the ruling class, Cuffay was clearly a dangerous man. Police

spies kept a close watch on his activities, as they did with the other black radicals Wedderburn and Davidson. Here again, spies found their way into the inner circles of working class organisations. A police spy was actually a member  of  the  seven-strong  'secret'  Committee  that  was  planning  an uprising. A group of 'luminaries' were arrested at the Orange Tree Tavern, Bloomsbury, on 15 August 1848 for allegedly plotting to set fire to 'certain buildings as a signal for the rising.' Seven Dials was to be one of the four stations  from  which  the  outbreak  on  16  August  was  to  be  attempted. 38 Cuffay  was  arrested  the  next  day.  He  refused  to  go  underground  'lest  it should be said that he abandoned his associates in the hour of peril'. 39

Evidence for Cuffay's conviction for waging war against the Queen was given by the police spies: Thomas Powell and George Davis. Cuffay had remained  intransigent  throughout  his  trial  and  made  a  powerful  speech before sentence was pronounced.

Found  guilty,  Cuffay  and  his  fellow  Chartists  were  sentenced  to transportation 'for the term of their natural lives'. The Times in its attempted balanced judgement commented, 'A severe sentence, but a most just one.' 40 The  radical  press,  however,  found  in  this  black  man  steadfastness  and courage.

Cuffay's transportation on the ship Adelaide ,  lasted 103 days. After he landed in Tasmania in November 1849, he was allowed to work as a tailor for wages. 41 Mindful of his earlier experiences of unemployment before he became a political activist, he practised his trade until the last year of his life. Cuffay's working class activities brought him into prominence and in the full public view. He was a larger than life character, who enjoyed great popularity.  So  much  so  that  social  commentators  found  him  interesting, even to the point of distorting his character and contribution to the Chartist movement.

While  the  black  radicals  Wedderburn,  Davidson  and  Cuffay,  among others, (i.e.  Matthew Bogle, Benjamin Prophitt and David Duffey) waged war against  the  English  ruling  class,  the  struggle  of  black  women,  in  the nineteenth century, to achieve self-respect from the degradation of slavery and in displaying unusual loyalty and devotion in the service of the British was exemplified in the lives of Mary Prince and Mary Seacole.

## Mary Prince: slave and 'servant'

Mary  Prince  was  born  a  slave  in  Bermuda  on  a  farm  owned  by  Charles Myners.  Her  mother  was  a  household  slave,  as  was  her  father,  a  sawyer, whose name was Prince.

In this household Mary's violent owner flogged her repeatedly for what he  considered  to  be  her  misdeeds.  Her  mistress  beat  her  too,  not  only instructing Mary in her household tasks, but also impressing upon her the difference between 'the smart of the rope, the cart-whip and the cow-skin'.

Later in her life Mary was sold into the service of Mr and Mrs Wood, where  among  other  tasks  she  had  to  nurse  their  child.  Years  of  work, washing clothes and standing in the water of the salt ponds took their toll and Mary developed rheumatism. By the time she arrived in England with Mr  Wood,  who  had  brought  his  son  to  attend  a  British  school,  her rheumatism had worsened and her body was 'dreadfully swelled'.

Unfortunately for Mary, her increasing disability was met with increasing anger and impatience from the Woods. She was ordered to leave and finally did so, seeking refuge with the Moravian missionaries in Hatton Garden. Given her destitution and her determination to obtain her freedom, Mary went first to the Anti-Slavery office in Aldermanbury towards the end of  November  1828  and  her  case  was  referred  to  George  Stephen  to  be investigated.

In  spite  of  the  Anti-Slavery  Society's  efforts,  Mr  Wood  stubbornly refused to let her go or to return to her husband in the West Indies. This was chattel slavery with a vengeance.  After working for a while as a charwoman,  Mary  finally  went  into  the  service  of  Mr  and  Mrs  Thomas Pringle, where she remained, at least until the time when she related her full story  in The  History  of  Mary  Prince:  A  West  Indian  Slave  Related  by Herself .

According to Pringle, the idea of writing her story was Mary Prince's own suggestion. Throughout her story, a unique view is presented of every facet of the life of a black woman in the service of her oppressors, first as a slave and then, more charitably, as a 'servant'. Indeed, black women were so used to being taken for granted that they were disgraced and, in Mary's words,  'thought  no  more  of  than  beasts'.  Mary's  service  in  England  was both tangible evidence and a reminder of that human debasement. Although

her  master  had  returned  to  the  West  Indies,  he  refused  to  set  Mary  free. Legally, she was still in his service; his property for the rest of her life.

Nothing  more  is  known  of  the  life  of  Mary  Prince.  The  unanswered questions  remain.  Did  she  get  her  freedom  and  return  to  her  husband  in Antigua?  Or  did  she  spend  the  rest  of  her  life  in  England?  Whatever  the answers,  Mary  Prince,  slave  and  'servant'  was  the  historical  precedent  of her sister in service, Mary Seacole.

## Mary Seacole: 'nurse and doctress'

Known as 'mother' to many white soldiers and civilians in many countries, Mary Seacole was born in Jamaica by the turn of the nineteenth century. Her  father  was  a  soldier  of  Scottish  background  and  her  mother,  a  black woman,  kept  a  boarding  house  in  Kingston.  In  her  role  as  'doctress'  her mother achieved high repute among the officers stationed in Kingston. 42

At  an  early  age,  Mary  showed  both  an  independence  of  mind  and  a desire  for  medical  knowledge  and  practice.  After  nursing  dogs  and  cats when she was about 12, she began assisting her mother who attended to the invalid officers and other sick persons who came to the boarding house. As she grew older, she developed a great desire to travel.

One  of  her  impressions  on  her  first  visit  to  England  was  the  vivid recollection  of  London  street-boys  poking  fun  at  her  complexion. After  a year in England, the enterprising Mary returned to Kingston. Soon she was back  again  in  England  for  another  two  years  with  a  large  stock  of  West Indian  preserves  and  pickles  for  sale.  Journeys  to  New  Providence,  Haiti and  Cuba  followed  before  she  was  again  at  her  mother's  side  learning creole medical art. 43

About  this  time,  she  married  a  Mr  Seacole  with  whom  she  had established  a  store.  This  enterprising  experience  would  serve  her  in  good stead later in life. She patiently nursed her husband who was dogged by illhealth. His death, a severe loss to Mary, was followed by the bitter blow of her mother's demise. After this, Mary resolved to take life as it came. When her house was burned down in the great fire of 1843 which swept through Kingston, she set about the practical task of rebuilding.

Like  her  mother,  she  had  gained  a  reputation  as  a  skilful  nurse  and doctress.  The  loneliness  which  might  have  ensued  was  preempted  by  the

continuous presence of invalid officers and their wives. Much knowledge was gained from naval and military surgeons who occasionally worked in her house.

When cholera  swept  Jamaica  in  1850,  Mary  Seacole  gave  invaluable service. Later travels took her to the Isthmus of Panama, Navy Bay, Gatun and up the river Chagres to Gorgona and Cruces. She confessed to having 'a little prejudice' against some Americans. Given that her complexion was a few  shades  of  deeper  brown  which  showed  she  was  related  to  the  black slaves  (a  relationship  she  was  proud  of)  she  asked,  'Is  it  surprising  that  I should  be  somewhat  impatient  of  the  airs  of  superiority  which  many Americans have endeavoured to assume over me?' 44

The  outbreak  of  cholera  at  Cruces  led  to  Mary  Seacole  attending successfully to the sick, thus earning herself the title the 'yellow doctress'. She  tirelessly  braved  the  primitive  conditions  under  which  she  worked. Unfortunately,  she  was  not  immune  and  cholera  attacked  her  overworked body.  Her  high  spirits  and  medical  knowledge  helped  towards  a  quick recovery.  While  at  Cruces,  she  also  had  the  invaluable  experience  of running  a  'hotel'  where  she  served  dinners,  but  had  no  lodgers.  This experience would also serve her well later.

After Cruces, she went to Gorgona before returning to Kingston where she stayed for eight months in 1853. According to Mrs Seacole, that year the ravages of yellow fever nearly exterminated the English in Jamaica. Yet again, she was on hand to administer and comfort the sick and dying. She turned down proposals of marriage from many men of high and low rank, because  her  lasting  love  seemed  to  be  a  yearning  to  travel  and  to  nurse. About that time, war was declared against Russia and in Jamaica news was expected  of  a  'descent  upon  the  Crimea'.  This  news  seemed  to  have affected her little at the time. She returned to Navy Bay, where she opened a store and got caught up in the 'gold fever'.

Each  new  trip  abroad  reinforced  Mary's  confidence  in  her  nursing ability.  In  the  face  of  sickness  and  death,  she  showed  initiative  and  great courage. Indeed, she met many challenges and was now preparing for the ultimate challenge: a longing to join the British Army at Sebastopol. After hearing  the  news  of  war  at  Sebastopol  she  wrote:  'Now,  no  sooner  had  I heard of war somewhere, than I longed to witness it; and when I was told

that many of the regiments I had known so well in Jamaica had left England for the scene of action, the desire to join them became stronger than ever.' 45

Preoccupied with Sebastopol and the Crimea, she arrived in London in the autumn of 1854, soon after the battle of Alma. In London, she devoted herself to a visionary 'new scheme'. With no friends and limited funds, she speculated  on  a  3000-mile  journey  that  would  take  her  to  Balaclava. The fundamental question remained: how would this unknown 'creole' woman persuade the British authorities that she would be useful to the British army in  Sebastopol?  Although  achieving  this  seemed  highly  improbable,  she persisted.

There  had  been  reports of mismanagement,  overcrowding  in  the hospitals, want and suffering in the Crimea. After the Russians had inflicted heavy  casualties,  the  hospitals  needed  disciplined  staff  to  attend  to  the hundreds  of  wounded  and  dying.  This  need  reinforced  Mary  Seacole's resolve to offer her services in the Crimea.

Indeed,  she  did  go  to  the  Crimea,  but  only  after  repeated  rebuffs  and disappointments which reflected her total commitment to the cause. A lesser person might not have made it. Her determination to serve her British 'sons' eventually  took  her  to  the  battlefront,  and  into  history  as  a  'Crimean heroine'.

Mary Seacole, the black nurse, felt she was well fitted for the tasks that awaited her. Indeed, she was 'the right woman in the right place'. Although she  was  well  qualified,  through  her  past  experience,  to  deal  with  the diseases  most  prevalent  in  the  Crimea  (cholera,  diarrhoea  and  dysentery) British officials at the  War  Office  referred  her  to  the  Quartermaster General's department, who in turn, referred her to the Medical Department. The  British  bureaucrats  were  not  convinced.  Colour  had  again  become  a factor.  She  complained that the authorities would not listen to a motherly 'yellow' woman, before changing her plans.

Her  next  scheme  was  to  offer  herself  for  recruitment  as  a  nurse, following Florence Nightingale's departure for the Crimea.  She  was convinced  that  she  was  'one  of  the  very  women  they  most  wanted', possessing the requisite experience and fondness of the work. Enrolment, she  reasoned,  would  be  no  problem.  Here  again,  during  this  period  of waiting,  her  colour  was  clearly  resented.  This  plan  of  going  through  the normal nursing channels also had to be abandoned when she was told that

the  full  complement  of  nurses  had  been  secured.  Following  an  interview with  one  of  Miss  Nightingale's  companions,  Mrs  Seacole  got  the  same negative reply. Disappointed, she wrote: 'I read in her face the fact, that had there been a vacancy, I should not have been chosen to fill it.' 46

In  desperation,  she  applied  to  the  managers  of  the  Crimea  Fund  for information as to whether they would help her to get to the camp, where she hoped something would turn up. Unfortunately, this attempt also failed. She felt  a  sense  of  cruel  disappointment  in  view  of  the  unselfish  motives  in going to the Crimea and the value of her service to the sick soldiers. Indeed, she found it most difficult to convince the authorities of these qualities. In that hopeless predicament she began to have doubts and suspicions as to the possibility  that American  prejudices  against  colour  might  have  had  some root in England. She asked, 'Did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs?'

Clearly,  there  was  no  way  of  making  the  trip  through  British  official agencies. Her only hope was to get to the Crimea at her own expense, on her own initiative. She took comfort in the fact that some of those she had cared for (and doctors she had worked with) in Jamaica, were there. They would vouch for her skill and experience, she reasoned. Rejected as a nurse by  British  officialdom  (at  a  time  when  the  nursing  profession  was  an occupation for the well-to-do classes) she entertained the idea of opening a hotel for invalids in the Crimea to be run in her own way. She acted upon her decision by printing cards which read:

## BRITISH HOTEL

Mrs Mary Seacole

( late of Kingston, Jamaica )

Respectfully announces to her former kind friends, and to the Officers of the Army and Navy generally

That  she  has  taken  her  passage  in  the  steamer Hollander ,  to  start from  London  on  the  25th  of  January,  intending  on  her  arrival  at Balaclava to establish a mess-table and comfortable quarters for the sick and convalescent officers. 47

While still preparing to leave England Mrs Seacole met again a Mr Day who  was  travelling  to  Balaclava  to  attend  to  some  shipping  business.

Together, they decided to open a store as well as a hotel near the camp. She emphasised,  however,  that  'These  new  arrangements  were  not  allowed  to interfere  in  any  way  with  the  main  object  of  my  journey.'  In  fact,  in anticipation,  most  of  her  limited  funds  were  invested  in  medicines  which she believed would be useful. How thoughtful. Still with the British soldier in mind, she used the remaining money to buy 'those home comforts' which would be difficult to get outside England.

Finally,  she  left  England  on  the Hollander , passing  through  Malta, Gibraltar and Constantinople, before visiting the Scutari hospital. On a tour of  the  wards,  she  was  greeted  with  shouts  of  'Mother  Seacole!  Mother Seacole!'  by  an  Irish  sergeant  she  had  known  in  Kingston.  She  sat  at  his bedside  and  tried  to  cheer  him  up  and,  at  the  risk  of  offending  hospital officials, she gave a helping hand. The suffering at the hospital was unlike anything she had ever seen. 'But if it is so here', she wrote, 'what must it not be at the scene of war … I must be useful three or four days nearer to their  pressing  wants  than  this.' 48 Thus,  she  was  ready  for  the  greatest challenge of her life.

On this journey she carried a letter of introduction from a doctor ('Dr F -')  to  Miss  Nightingale.  To  one  of  Miss  Nightingale's  assistants,  Mrs Seacole  was  more  of  an  object  of  'curiosity  and  surprise'  than  a  deeply committed  volunteer  for service.  Assuming  that Mrs  Seacole  sought employment at Scutari, this assistant kindly told her that Miss Nightingale already had the entire management of the hospital staff and that there was no  vacancy.  When  Mrs  Seacole  interrupted  her  by  saying  that  she  was bound  for  the  battlefront  in  a  few  days,  the  assistant  was  left  even  more surprised.

About half an hour later, Mary Seacole met Florence Nightingale. This is how she described the English nurse who would achieve world renown:

A slight figure, in nurses' dress, with a pale, gentle, and withal firm face, resting lightly in the palm of one white hand, while the other supports  the  elbow  -  a  position  which  gives  to  her  countenance  a keen inquiring expression which is rather marked. Standing thus in repose and yet keenly observant - the greatest sign of impatience at any  time  a  slight,  perhaps  unwitting  motion  of  the  firmly  planted right foot - was Florence Nightingale. 49

After reading Mrs Seacole's letter of introduction, Miss Nightingale in a gentle,  practical  and  businesslike  way  asked,  'What  do  you  want,  Mrs Seacole - anything that we can do for you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy.' 50

Although  overcrowding  in  the  Scutari  hospital  presented  a  problem, Mrs  Seacole  was  able  to find a bed  for the night in the hospital washerwoman's quarters, before resuming her journey on the Hollander to Balaclava. The six weeks she spent at Balaclava were 'rough'. Nevertheless, with permission from the authorities, she set up a store and gave  English  language  lessons  to  a  Turkish  Pasha.  Mrs  Seacole's  British Hotel,  never  fully  completed  (indeed  a  year  later,  it  still  needed  shutters) gained a great reputation.

The  written  records  of  many  testify  to  Mary  Seacole's  work  in  the Crimea. Given the comments of those well-placed to make a judgement, it is  clear  that  she  had  achieved the goal of serving as camp doctress, nurse and  'mother'.  Her  natural  concern,  which  seemed  boundless,  facilitated flexibility  in  activity  demanded  by  the  war.  Not  surprisingly,  her  many patients  turned  to  her  firstly,  because  these  men  had  serious  objection  to going into hospital (except in urgent cases) and secondly, because they were able  to  get  the  'sick-comforts'  and  nourishing  food  available  at  Mrs Seacole's  store.  An  additional  reason  why  many  came  to  Mrs  Seacole's British Hotel for medical treatment was, in her own words, because she was 'very  familiar  with  the  diseases  which  they  suffered  most  from  and successful in their treatment'.

After Sebastopol was taken, she wrote, 'the great work was accomplished'. Indeed, her great struggle to get there was also accomplished in the teeth of 'official indifference, hauteur and prejudice'. It was for her, a great triumph, a moment to savour.

Mrs Seacole returned to England and worked for a while in Aldershot. The acclaim she received subsequently was a well-deserved bonus. Financially,  however,  she  was  in  a  precarious  position,  for  some  time.  In fact,  she  was  ready  to  'journey  to  any  place'  in  search  of  employment. Although poor, she was proud of the service she had given for others.

In England, she reflected on the results of her Crimean campaign: she was in poor health, bankrupt and unemployed. What, in fact, Mary Seacole had gained was friendship, particularly from those she had met before and

after  Sebastopol.  In  London,  she  enjoyed  being  recognised.  She  derived great pleasure and satisfaction, having achieved her goal of getting to the Crimea and back, through her stubbornness to serve the cause of Britain, in keeping with the legacy of her Jamaican past.

Nevertheless,  the  'Crimean  heroine'  was  poor  and  unemployed.  In recompense  for  her  'charities  and  incessant  labours'  among  the Army,  as she  put  it,  a  number  of  'noblemen  and  gentlemen'  who  knew  her  in  the Crimea had set up a Committee to aid her. Yet in spite of the courage and the indomitable spirit displayed by this extraordinary woman in the service of  Britain,  sadly,  one  can't  help  recalling  the  problems  which  confronted British charities some seventy-five years earlier, in assisting the black poor in London.

Some,  however,  remembered  and  stood  by  her.  For  Mrs  Seacole's benefit,  a  friend,  Lord  Rokeby,  to  whom  her  book  was  dedicated,  among other well-to-do friends, organised a four-day musical festival at the Surrey Gardens,  with  one  thousand  performers,  nine  military  bands  and  an orchestra. At this event, Mary Seacole took 'pride of place', seated in the front  of  the  gallery  flanked  by  Lord  Rokeby  and  Lord  George  Paget. Unfortunately,  this  massive  effort  raised  only  £228  for  Mrs  Seacole. 51 Although she never realised a fortune, her fame was unquestioned. Cheers greeted her wherever she went and publication of her autobiography, The Wonderful Adventures of Mary Seacole in Many Lands , helped to maintain her popularity.

After  1857,  she  spent  most  of  the  rest  of  her  life  in  England  and continued  to  enjoy  the  friendship  of  members  of  the  English  aristocracy. Indeed, Queen Victoria's kinsman, Count Gleichen, the sculptor, did a small bust of her; and Lord Rokeby and his daughter were all remembered in her will.  When  the  firm  of  Day  and  Seacole  was  wound  up,  Mary  Seacole needed all the financial help she could get. While little is known of how she recouped her fortunes, she left over £2600 when she died on 14 May 1881.

After her death, she seemed to have been 'totally forgotten' in England. By  chance,  her  grave  was  recently  discovered  in  a  'complete  state  of disrepair, stones cracked and crumbling, headstone with mildew and dirt'. Efforts were undertaken to restore the headstone by the Lignum Vitae Club (an association of Jamaican women in London) and the British Commonwealth Nurses War Memorial Fund.

If the 'yellow doctress' was forgotten in England, she was remembered in Jamaica, where the Nurses Association of Jamaica Headquarters was renamed  'Mary  Seacole  House'.  For  the  Association,  Mrs  Seacole  has remained a source of great inspiration. Recently, a reconsecration ceremony was held at her graveside in London. In accordance with her wish, she was buried 'in the Catholic portion of the cemetery at Kensal Green, London'. The  restored  headstone  read:  'Here  lies  Mary  Seacole  (1805-1881)  of Kingston, Jamaica, a notable nurse who cared for the sick and wounded in the  West  Indies,  Panama  and  on  the  battlefields  of  the  Crimea,  18541856.' 52

Mary Seacole was an outstanding nineteenth-century example of a black woman  from  the  Caribbean  who,  through  service  in  the  imperial  cause, found her way from the colonial periphery to the metropolitan centre. While her struggle reflected the oppression of women generally in the nineteenth century,  she  was  the  precursor  of  an  exodus  of  Florence  Nightingaleoriented black nurses who came to serve Britain in the twentieth century, only to realise the harsh reality of race and colour prejudice.

## The Indian diaspora: 'a new system of slavery'

The abolition of the slave trade did not end slavery on the plantations. In the British sugar colonies, sugar and servitude remained tied together, dictating the economic, political and social structure.

In the aftermath of full Emancipation of the slaves in 1838, the labour vacuum on the plantations was filled by East Indian indentured labour. In Mauritius,  one  of  the  most  oppressive  territories  during  the  period  of Apprenticeship  (which  came  on  1  February  1835,  later than in the Caribbean) it was estimated that as many as one-seventh of the slaves were from South India. 1 Not surprisingly therefore, Mauritius planters turned to India for their  plantation  labour  force.  In  1840  Mauritius  received  18,000 Indian labourers.  The West Indian sugar islands, with no immediate supply 2 of labour, went through a period of decay. Pressure from the planters was

mounted to get the British government to induce East Indians to labour for deplorably  low  wages.  Thus,  'Negro'  slavery  in  the  Caribbean  and  the Mascarenes  was  replaced  by  a  'new  system  of  slavery'  -  East  Indian indentured labour.

The  actual  functioning  of  the  institution  of  slavery  and  of  indentured labour and other forms of bondage which followed can only be understood by reference to the plantation products, and by some account of how this form of production evolved. Given the opening up of the New World and the  acquisition  of  tropical  colonies  by  the  warring  European  powers,  and the  high  priority  given  to  the  cultivation  of  tropical  products  in  the metropolis, a new unit of production, the plantation, emerged.

During  the  eighteenth  century,  until  the  end  of  the  Napoleonic  wars, British West Indian sugar enjoyed a preference against the tariff on foreign sugar and sugar from elsewhere in the British Empire. With the capture and occupation  of  Trinidad  and  Demerara  (British  Guiana)  new  competitors within  the  British  monopoly  were  accepted.  By  1830,  there  had  been  a change  in  the  relative  importance  of  the  sugar  producing  colonies.  For example, that year, Jamaica exported only 68,962 tons (having exported a record  99,600  tons  in  1805),  Trinidad's  total  was  10,244  tons,  British Guiana produced 59,790 tons and Mauritius 32,750 tons. Further, the new undeveloped  colonies  surged  ahead.  In  1840,  Mauritius  exported  36,559 tons  with  British  Guiana  35,619  tons,  Jamaica  slipped  further  down  with 26,453 tons and Trinidad 12,258 tons. 3

During the 1840s, the free trade campaign led to a lowering of tariffs protecting  British  and  British  colonial  produce  in  line  with  the  duties  on foreign  imports.   Given  the  hard  times  which  hit  the  British  West  Indian 4 plantations between 1840 and 1950, the English capitalists were faced with the challenge of producing a larger volume of sugar at cheaper prices. To do this, given the state of technology, cheap labour was the only way possible. Thus, Mauritius, in close proximity to the Indian labour market was able to increase  its  exports.  In  1855  the  area  under  sugar  production  was  81,000 acres,  rising  to  122,000  acres  ten  years  later.  While  production  in  British Guiana and Jamaica had levelled out, Trinidad's output increased steadily. Mauritius, however, was the principal British sugar producer, dramatically increasing  its  exports  from  55,163  tons  in  1850  to  134,048  tons  in  1860. Five years later, a record crop of 165,000 tons was achieved. 5

Given the changes in the sugar industry in the various islands, in terms of the mode of production, little had changed in Mauritius since the days of slavery.  As the ruling power in the Empire, Britain owned and controlled 6 production in the tropical territories. And although free trade was substituted for mercantilist monopoly  between  the  1840s  and  1860s, colonial dependency on Britain was much the same. While some colonies experienced a degree of prosperity such as Burma (and to a lesser extent Ceylon  and  Malaya)  British  economic  policies  and  practices  had  adverse effects upon other colonies. Thus, India succeeded Africa in providing the insatiable capitalist demand  for  cheap  and  disposable  labour  on  the plantations and mines to maintain the British/colonial relationship.

Because  most  of  India's  population,  an  estimated  80  per  cent,  were engaged in agriculture and because of the instability of the rural economy, due  to  the  loss  of  land  of  peasant  farmers  falling  into  debt,  or  through illness, many found themselves landless labourers. Predictably, there was a desperate drift that took on added significance in times of famine, flood or invasion.  Consequently,  a  large  pool  of  floating,  casual  labour  was  to  be found in India's large cities.

Towards the end of the eighteenth century there were Indian labourers in the ports of south-east Asia. In fact, the East India Company's attempt to establish a trading station in lower Burma on Negrais Island in 1753-9 was dependent  on  Indian  labour.  When  the  settlement  was  withdrawn,  the families of the 'Coolies' sent to Negrais complained that the 'Head Cooly' was paid 'what money those who died there left behind them'. 7

Labouring far from home was an acceptable part of the reality of life for thousands  of  poor  Indian  families,  perhaps  because  such  employment, usually short-term, allowed a return to their homes. However, different and disturbing  patterns  began  to  emerge  with  the  export  of  Indians  further afield. Forced banishment killed hopes of a return home. In addition to the domestic slavery prevalent in India during the eighteenth century, there was a trade in slaves to supply the sugar plantations of the Mascarenes. South Indian  slaves  from  Kerala  were  taken  by  the  Dutch  to  Mauritius.  By  the latter part of the eighteenth century (in spite of the proclamation in 1789 by the Governor-General, Lord Cornwallis, prohibiting the export of people as slaves to different parts of India and beyond) slaves were regularly sold to French  planters  in  Mauritius  and  Reunion.  Kidnapping  men,  women  and

children was part of that trade. There were some 6000 Indian slaves in 1800 on  the  Mauritian  estates,  with  thousands  of  enslaved  Indians  in  Reunion where  slavery  was  not  abolished  until  1848.   Moreover,  convicts  were 8 transported to Mauritius in 1815 at the request of Governor Farquhar.

In spite of the Hindu  objection to crossing the 'Black Water', emigration  was  already  regarded  as  a  natural  progression  in  the  early nineteenth century. Among  those  lured to servile labour abroad (to Mauritius and British Guiana) were the Dhangars or Hill Coolies, who were regarded as good workmen and preferred by the planters. During the 1840s and 1850s they formed a substantial number of those taken abroad under the indentureship  system.  From  the  1850s,  however,  their  proportion dwindled. It was estimated that from two-fifths to one-half of the emigrants were Dhangars. 9

Travelling to Mauritius was in itself, a formidable proposition. But that long hazardous journey to the West Indies was another matter. During the 1850s,  the  mortality  rates  on  voyages  to  the  West  Indies  reached  an appalling  level.  Apart  from  the  incidental  humanitarian  concern,  at  this time, in the reckoning of the capitalist log-book, the loss of a quarter or a third of the cargo of coolies was 'a major commercial loss' on the voyage. And  interestingly,  the  'better  workmen',  the  Hill  Coolies,  were  at  the greatest  risk.  The  death  rate  among  them  was  considerably  higher  than among the plains people. Significantly during the long sea voyages, suicide was a common form of death.

Apart from the sugar colonies, from the 1860s, the tea industry began to make labour  demands. With  the  drying  up  of  the  supply  of  Hill  Coolies, demands were made on the 'flotsam of humanity' in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.  Most  of  these  simple  country  people  were  herded  towards  the Emigration Agent's  depot  where  their  muscles  and  hands  were  examined for  the  rigours  of  manual  labour.  Despite  these  checks  (were  they  mere formality?)  the  most  'outlandish'  emigrants  were  taken  aboard  to  fill  the ships, which was clearly the object of the exercise.

Calcutta was the main port of embarkation during the first 30-40 years of organised emigration until about 1870. Labourers were drawn particularly  from  Banaras  Province  and  Bihar  where,  as  the  people  at  the bottom end of society, they were economically and socially inferior. These low-caste people were at the mercy of the superior castes. In effect, many

were, as in Bihar, in a state of semi-slavery known as Kamiuti , by which the poor  people  sold  their  services,  and  sometimes  those  of  their  children  in years  to  come,  in  order  to  meet  their  pressing  needs.  These  people  were most vulnerable to the recruiters of indentured labour. 10

Among the early emigrants, many were from what was then known as the Western Districts of British India: those between Banaras and Allahabad. A  major  push  factor,  the  'awful  famine'  of  the  early  1840s  in Upper  India  resulted  in  a  mass  exodus,  first  to  Bihar,  where  they  were 'persuaded  to  embark'.  To  this  point,  people  came  from  as  far  as  Delhi. Also, during the 1840s, emigration built up at Madras and in Bombay.

Overall,  the  main  movement of indentured emigration occurred in the years  before  1880.  By  1871,  Mauritius  had  a  population  composed  of 216,258 Indians and 99,784 Creoles, mainly of African descent. Thereafter, as fewer went to Mauritius, the flow was deflected to fill a steady demand in the Caribbean,  with  growing  numbers  going  to  Natal  during  the remaining  years  of  the  nineteenth  century. 11 Emigration  from  Madras expanded  during  the  1870s  to  satisfy  the  growing  demands  of  Ceylon, Burma, Mauritius, the Straits Settlements, Natal and the Caribbean.

By 1900,  British  Guiana  had  a  larger  Indian  population  than  Malaya. The Malayan rubber boom, however, siphoned-off a considerable number of the labourers from Madras to the rubber estates. Moreover, Fiji became a significant importer of Indian labour. While Madras also supplied the heavy demand in Natal, emigration from Calcutta continued.

Towards  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the  Indian  diaspora  had stretched far and wide as the planters' demand for labour was satisfied. In the  West  Indies,  St  Lucia,  St  Kitts,  Grenada,  St  Vincent,  Martinique, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and British Guiana all called on Indian labour. Further, Fiji, the Straits Settlements, Burma,  Malaya, Mauritius,  Ceylon  and  Reunion  had  large  infusions  of  labourers.  And  in South Africa, they went to Natal and Durban. In East Africa, they went to Kenya and were called upon to build the Uganda Railway.

According to one estimate 525,482 Indians emigrated under indenture to  French  and  British  sugar  colonies  between  1842  and  1870.  Of  these, 351,401  went  to  Mauritius,  76,691  to  British  Guiana  and  42,519  to Trinidad,  with  15,169  to  Jamaica.  Natal  received  6,448  and  Reunion imported 15,005; both these importations were between 1860 and 1870. The

other  French  colonies  took  16,341  Indians  in  the  same  decade.  One calculation made in 1869 showed that immigration from India during 184367 amounted to 1,446,407 of whom 89,897 returned to India. An estimated 250,000  had  settled in Ceylon  (now  Sri  Lanka),  while  the  350,000 unaccounted  for  were  presumed  dead.  Overall  then,  between  one  to  two million  Indian  labourers  went  overseas  to  the  tropical  plantations  during 1830-70. 12

Although the Anti-Slavery Society had expressed its concern in 1872, there was general complacency in Britain, but eventually protest against the system,  undertaken  during  a  very  long  period  of  questioning,  was  to overcome  even  the  massive  inertia  of  the  Government  of  India.  Many aspects  of  the  system  aroused  concern,  but  always  much  too  slowly.  The deadly diseases (cholera, typhoid and dysentery, among others) plagued the indentured  labourers.  The  passage  over  the  menacing  oceans  on  sailing ships  was  a  difficult  ordeal  for  passengers  and  crew.  Those  who  arrived alive at the end of their journeys, were both shattered and strengthened.

Having  suffered  a  tortuous  passage  to  the  plantations,  for  various reasons,  only  between  one-third  and  one-quarter  of  the  emigrants  to  the distant  colonies  ever  returned.  Basically,  the  right  of  a  return  passage  to Indians  was  only  reluctantly  conceded  by  the  colonial  authorities.  In Mauritius, for example, this was granted only to the 'indigent, the sick and the misfits'. Underlying this return was the fact that those who did so were 'either the defeated, or the winners, either poor or rich'.

Apart from the rich and poor groupings among the returnees, there was another category of Indians from the diaspora who came back on holiday. The  children  of  indentured  Indians,  having  traced  their  ancestral  village, were shocked to find that their parents were only vaguely remembered or in some  cases  forgotten  in  caste-ridden  India.  The  effect  on  these  secondgeneration Indians during their genealogical visit to the Motherland was to lead  to  a  preferable,  hasty  retreat  back  to  the  familiar  colonies! Although some Indians returned to India with a spirit of independence, they were the exceptions. While generations of human beings had laboured and died, the old  slave  plantation  system  had  remained  largely  unchanged  since  the eighteenth century. Into the twentieth century, work on the sugar estates was still  a  gruelling experience as it was intended to be (closely monitored by the  watchful  eyes  of  the  Protectors  and  Magistrates  of  the  estates  who identified with the interests of the planters); the Indian indentured labourers

were monitored and exploited to the hilt. Under this extremely oppressive regime, they laboured throughout their terms of indenture for a pittance.

That  some  survived  this  ordeal  was  due  largely  to  their  resilience,  or closer to the truth was the fact that they had no alternative. They relied on a community  spirit:  organising  a  social  life  in  relation  to  the  'lost  India'. Thus, their festivals and feasts were crucial safety valves which aided their survival.  But  these  were  occasional  moments  of  cultural  release.  Their grinding  poverty  and  the  constant  demands  on  their  labour,  were  ever present. As sickness and premature death took their toll, many resorted to drunkenness to temper the boredom and emptiness of their lives. In effect, they  were  lost  and  a  long,  long  way  from  home.  The  feeling  of  betrayal among them was strong. According to descendants of indentured labourers in  Trinidad,  'They  had  spent  their  first  year  in  Trinidad  'crying'  as  they remembered their homes and realised how badly they had been 'tricked'.' 13 This story had echoes elsewhere, such as in the Straits Settlements.

On the estates, the 'task' was the assignment with which newcomers had to  come  to  terms.  Not  only  was  it  an  'un-Indian'  way  of  working,  it  was grossly unfair in that newcomers who failed to complete their assignments forfeited any payment for the day's work. Thus, the labourer was liable to the daily imposition of maximum hours of work. Moreover, the strong were played off against the weak. For example, a task might require a 15-hour working day for the weaker or less experienced coolies, while a stronger, more capable worker could do it in about half the time.

Like the slaves before them, the coolies ('a compulsory labour force') had to be kept by their employers. Thus, the indentured labourer in earning his keep became the 'all-purpose work animal' as the primitive system of manual labour took precedence over the more extended use of implements worked by steam machinery or by animal (mules and oxen) power. Given the wear and tear of the system, generally, the coolies were either at work, in  hospital  or,  more  often  than  not,  in  gaol.  Few  were  free  of  either  the threat, or the actual fact, of some form of punishment. This attitude towards them  as  convicts  was  a  mark  of  their  bondage  under  the  plantation indentured labour system.

To maintain obedience to the demands of the plantations, flogging was a common form of discipline. Planters were all powerful; some taking the law into their hands. As one of them put it, 'Every man is a magistrate on his own estate, you know, and therefore as long as the man is working for you,

you have a right to do what you like with him - that is, anything short of killing him.' 14 Indeed only just 'short of killing him' was a clear statement of the treatment meted out to the Indian coolies. According to the Mauritius Royal  Commission,  during  the  period  1867-72,  50  Indians  had  died  of rupture of the spleen as a result of severe beatings. There was no record of punishment of those responsible.

Given all the atrocities committed by planters and their managers, there were  few  official  comments  either  in  India,  in  Britain  or  in  the  colonies. Indeed,  it  was  the  Sanderson  Committee  which  drew  attention  to  the alarming  number  of  convictions  of  indentured  labourers  in  the  sugar colonies. Was this passive disobedience in the face of planters' oppression and exploitation? Or was it a wilful act on the part of the employer to instil obedience  through  fear  into  an  already  'docile'  and  'submissive'  labour force? Given the abuses of the system, the Sanderson Committee underlined the various labour codes applying to both indentured and 'free' Indians.

The stereotype image of the vagrant Indian labourer was reinforced in colonial reports. As it was, the system which brought them to the colonies as workers now condemned them as vagrants. In 1878, there were 20,000 vagrants in Mauritius, and predictably, a 'Vagrancy Committee' was set up. Most interestingly, however, if a time-expired indentured labourer refused employment (as a 'free' man) he was classed as a vagrant. And if he was still without registered employment after three months, he was regarded as an 'incorrigible vagrant'. Hemmed in from all sides, a considerable number of  Indians  who  should  have  been  hospitalised  or  receiving  medical  care were  woefully  neglected,  and  left  to  die  and  end  their  indentureship prematurely.

Taken together, disease, bad housing, lack of medical attention and care, and  malnutrition  contributed  to  suicide.  In  1871,  Sir  Arthur  Gordon,  the Governor  of  Mauritius,  commenting  on  the  'extraordinary  frequency  of suicides  among  Indian  immigrants'  in  the  colony,  attributed  this  partly  to the  shortage  of  women.  He  added  however  'I  myself  believe  that  a  very large proportion of the suicides are due to nostalgia or an intense desire to return to India which they have no means of gratifying.' 15 As a result of the agitation  of  Indian  Nationalist,  Dadabhai  Naoroji,  officials  began  to  take notice of the suicide statistics. In fact, the indentured labourers' lives were

monotonous and unattractive; indeed, many had quarrelled over the lack of women in their communities.

As in slavery, under indentureship, marriage or 'companionage' was an unstable relationship. Although a wife was a status symbol (of security and prosperity), the low-status poor man was liable to have his wife taken away by a man of superior status. This dearth of women aroused much concern and comment. In fact, disputes over women constituted the main cause of murders and suicides.

In addition to the hostility which surrounded them, Indian labourers also had to contend with the rising antagonism of the Creole Blacks, on and off the plantations.

The  ex-slaves  were  conscious  of  the  Indians  as  labour  which  was replacing them on the plantations. Indeed, Indians were used by planters as strike-breakers in Jamaica and other West Indian islands. Soon, both Indians and Creoles developed stereotyped views referring to each other as 'nigger' and 'coolie'. In colonies where the Indians were a small minority they were 'Creolised'. And where they complemented Creole Blacks economically, as in  Trinidad,  they  achieved  a  partnership.  A  major  point  of  contention between the two groups, however, was Indian immigration. In fact, as early as 1857, Blacks in Jamaica encouraged by Baptist missionaries, petitioned against Indian immigration. In 1866, there were strikes by native labourers for  higher  wages. It  was  argued that without the reserve supply of Indian labour,  employers  would  have  been  compelled  to  raise  wages  by  25  per cent. 16

In spite of the antagonism between Creole Blacks and the Indians, some integration  and  intermarriage  had  taken  place,  particularly  in  the  smaller islands.  In  general,  however,  the  Blacks  did  not  allow  them  into  their community. This was especially marked in the French colonies. 17 To Blacks in the West Indies, the Indians were 'Coolie Slaves'. 18 It seemed the Indians were  almost  always  stigmatised  as  the  dregs  of  their  country:  'low-born, even criminal'. 19

Through all this, they showed an almost limitless patience and capacity to suffer. Although it seemed the Indians were pacified by small concessions, this approach was balanced by the severe punishment meted out  to  'ringleaders'  by  the  Immigration  Department.  Moreover,  reflecting their total subservience, 'It was an absolute principle of the system that no

Indian  labourer  should  ever  acquire  a  recognised  position  as  a  leader  or even as a negotiator. Their only recognised role was that of petitioners: and humble petitioners too.' 20

But  such  revolts  as  there  were,  were  'sad  and  sordid'  as  in  1869  in British Guiana. In 1903 there was, in the always highly charged atmosphere of  British  Guiana,  a  wave  of  strikes,  and  in  Surinam  there  was  industrial unrest where an attempt by Dutch troops to arrest the Indians resulted in 13 dead and 40 wounded.

It has been argued that the rise of protest in the Caribbean reflected the fact that the Indians were becoming conscious of their rights. On the other hand, the absence of mass protest in Mauritius, Ceylon, Malaya and Natal (prior  to  Gandhi's  efforts)  is  evidence  of  successful  organisation  in  these territories. Together, these protests demonstrated the potential solidarity of the Indians. The one factor which gave the 'coolies' an advantage over the slaves  was  that  one  day  their  'slavery'  would  be  ended.  It  was  this expectation, not escape or revolt, which generated hope by the close of the nineteenth century.

Thus, in response to the global demands of British capitalism, an Indian diaspora  had  come  into  being  and  settled  (albeit  uneasily)  next  to  the African diaspora. Capital's advantage in creating and widening schisms and divisions between these two major colonial labour groups, would become a major manipulative weapon during the twentieth century. Already, however, the questions of race and colour, on which colonial exploitation was based, were uppermost in the minds of both African and Indian nationalists. The black  intelligentsia  from  both  the  African  and  Indian  diaspora  would continue  to  challenge  the  questions  of  race  and  colour,  and  demand  the fundamental right of self-government.

## Pan Africanism: origins and early development

Given the deep roots of the Pan African tradition, a pre-history which could be  dated  back  to  Cugoano  and  Equiano  in  the  eighteenth  century,  it  was only  in  the  nineteenth  century  that  the  Pan  African  idea  put  forward  by Delany  and  Edward  Blyden,  achieved  some  clarity  and  form  in  Britain when the African Association came into being on 24 September 1897 with Henry Sylvester Williams as honorary secretary. 21 This was merged into the

new  Pan African Association  following  the  first  Pan African  Conference called  in  London in 1900. Williams was the moving light behind the Pan African  Association  and  the  brain  behind  the  Pan  African  Conference. Preceding  him  were  Celestine  Edwards  and  J.  A.  Thorne.  Apart  from Blyden's pioneering work, the efforts of both men had an important bearing on these formations in support of the 'Black Race'.

## Celestine Edwards

Celestine Edwards was born in Dominica in 1857. Having there developed 'burning convictions', namely the truth of fundamentalist Christianity, the cause of temperance and a strong belief in human rights and brotherhood, 22 Edwards  came  to  live  in  Britain.  The  date  of  his  arrival  cannot  be ascertained.  It  is  clear,  however,  that  he  lived  with  his  cousin  William  in Edinburgh where he became active in the temperance movement. He then moved  to  Sunderland  before  settling  in  the  East  End  of  London  about 1880. 23

He was proud of his blackness and showed a dedication to the theme of Black self-betterment throughout his life. In fact, he distinguished himself by being the first Black man to become an editor in Britain, preceding such Pan Africanists as Sylvester Williams, Duse Mohamed Ali and John Eldred Taylor.  He  edited  the  magazines Lux and Fraternity ,  which  reflected  his political commitment to a Pan African press.

Edwards had heralded a long list of remarkable Blacks in Britain who contributed to the Pan African movement, but who are less well-known than their twentieth century successors, namely  C. L. R. James, George Padmore, Ras Makonnen, Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta and Wallace Johnson,  among  others.  One  such  Pan  Africanist  of  note,  during  the nineteenth century, was J. A. Thorne.

## J. A. Thorne: the 'preliminary stage' 1894-7

In  the  'preliminary  stage'  of  Pan  Africanism,  J.  Albert  Thorne  played  a central  role  in  Britain. As  a  'descendant  of Africa  and  Barbados'  he  had hoped eventually to establish a colony of one hundred West Indian families on the banks of the Zambezi. His African Colonial Enterprise provides an important  focus  in  the  development  of  Pan  African  nationalism.  Indeed, Thorne  is  (and  must  be)  regarded  as  a  precursor  of  Marcus  Garvey.  His repatriation  scheme  and  general  philosophy  in  relation  to  Africa  'would

have  been  most  likely  to  have  fertilised  the  embryo  of  Marcus  Garvey's racial nationalism'. 24

Thorne was born in Barbados on 2 May 1860, the last of 13 children born to George and Jane Thorne. Albert was one of the five children who survived smallpox and cholera. His father rose from labourer to become a highly  respected  small  landowner  and  also  a  devoted  member  of  the Anglican  Church.  Thus,  hard  work  and  a  religious  upbringing  had  a powerful influence on young Albert, who did exceptionally well at school and  served  as  a  pupil-teacher  from  November  1873  to  December  1876. Having made considerable progress he became disenchanted with his career as a teacher. If he had the choice, he would have preferred being a printer. It was clear, however, that he had a great respect for scholarship.

In  1879,  when  he  was  19,  he  arrived  in  British  Guiana  and  after enrolling for a course at the Colonial Hospital, he received a diploma as a principal  dispenser  and  dresser.  He  also  did  missionary  work  for  the Moravians  in  Demerara.  Soon  after  his  brother,  who  ran  a  respectable druggist establishment in Georgetown, had left for Scotland, Albert returned to Barbados. In 1884 he arrived in England.

After making 'a host of friends', some of whom were in high positions, Thorne was impressed by the force of commitment of 'these good people' to the moral advancement of their own race. Thus, he set out to work for 'the temporal and spiritual advancement of our race'. 25

He  registered  as  a  medical  student  at  the  University  of  Aberdeen  in Scotland on 31 October 1887 and graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery on 28 October 1893. Later, he recalled that it  was  about  two  or  three  years  before  his  graduation  that  the  plan  of African colonisation was conceived. According to Robert Hill, it was highly likely  that  Thorne  was  influenced  to  some  degree  by  Edward  Wilmot Blyden's  work, Christianity,  Islam  and  the  Negro  Race , a  fundamental theme of which was 'African colonisation'.

About this time, Thorne met Dr James Johnston (the Scottish missionary) who had arrived in England between February and April 1891, with  a  party  of  six  Jamaican  missionary  assistants  on  their  way  to  South Central Africa.  In  spite  of  Thorne's  argument  that  his  plan  was  'a  purely original  experiment',  Robert  Hill  stated  that  Thorne  could  probably  have

been influenced by the pioneering work of Dr Johnston between 1891 and 1892.

The  years  between  1891  and  1893  were  crucial  to  British  colonial consolidation in Central Africa. In the scramble for African territory, Thorne felt  West  Indians  should  stake  their  claim.  The  Rev  Fergus  Ferguson  of Glasgow wrote that Thorne might become 'the Moses of our day to lead his people back to the land of promise'. Unfortunately, Thorne's promising plan was beset by problems. For instance, the African Sub-Committee made it clear that 'he  would  be  shut  out  from  intervening  in  the  sphere  of missionary operations on the Zambesi'. His idea of an African fatherland and  of  'a  great  movement  of  enterprise'  was  what  ultimately  Marcus Garvey was to realise, but it should be clear that 'the seed was planted and watered quite some time before it came to fruition in the Universal Negro Improvement Association'. 26

Thorne's  scheme  to  take  West  Indian  settlers  to  his  African  Zion received  a  decisive  setback  from  which  it  did  not  recover.  Following  an editorial in the Jamaica Daily Gleaner on 13 March 1897 entitled 'The Fall of Dr Thorne', the members of Thorne's Preliminary Committee 'resolved to withdraw entirely from the scheme'. This action by the Committee dealt a  severe  blow  to  the  chances  of  success  of  Thorne's  scheme.  Further,  an attempt was made to discredit Thorne's personal character. In the muckraking  which  ensued  his  alleged  marriage  was  seen  as  a  means  to financial  gain,  and Truth , published  in  London,  stated  'Not  only  is  it extremely doubtful whether any nigger will be better off in the land of his ancestors than in the West Indies but the fitness of the Ethiopian Moses to lead this exodus  is open  to considerable question.' 27 Following  the acrimony,  the  only  support  Thorne  received  came  from  the Illustrated Missionary News .

Given these problems, Thorne's plan to select ten 'pioneer settlers' and gather whatever support he could obtain in the West Indies in order to take them  to the Zambezi  in British Central  Africa was  never realised. Nonetheless,  for  Thorne  this  experience  was  one  of  self-discovery  and racial  awakening.  Before  leaving  England,  he  wrote  to  Bishop  Henry McNeal  Turner  in  America,  whose Voice of Missions he had read. Moreover,  Thorne's  'Africa  for Africans'  letter  to  the African  Times was reprinted  in  full  in  November  1896  in  the Voice  of  Missions .  Given  the

problems of the Pan African Triangle (or quadrangle), his letter to Bishop Turner stated:

The first great lesson we have to learn, I think, is unity. It does not matter  whether  we  are  born  in  Africa,  in  the  United  States  of America,  in  the  West  Indian  Islands  or  in  any  other  part  of  the world.  It  is  enough  that  we  are  all  members  of  the  African  race, whose past history has been the same, whose future is also identical, and  whose  present,  though  it  may  differ  in  a  few  individual instances,  nevertheless  is,  in  the  main,  beset  by  the  same  racial disabilities. 28

This constituted  the  essence  of  the  ideology  of  Pan Africanism  as  the racial vanguard of the African diaspora. Three years after writing to Turner, the  first  Pan African  Conference was called in London with Turner being one of the leading participants. Had Thorne stayed in England, it is more than likely he would have attended the Pan African Conference, and thus, his work would have become better known. What is clear, however, is that his  work  and  idea  of  a  'Zion  on  the  Zambezi'  was  the  preliminary  phase which had laid some of the essential groundwork in the years 1894-97 in England  and  Scotland  for  the  emergence  and  later  development  of  Pan Africanism.

## The influence of Henry Sylvester Williams

Having  laid  the  groundwork  and  departed,  Thorne's  idea  of  an  African homeland remained to be acted upon. The black radicals in Britain during the nineteenth century had seen, as products of the colonial plantations, the relevance  and  importance  of  the  British  and  colonial  working  classes. Indeed,  exploitation  was  relative.  The  small  group  of  black  people  in Britain, because  they  were  easily  identified  and  alien,  suffered  from discrimination  as  no  other  group  before  them.  The  degradation  of  Blacks and  the  pseudo-scientific  arguments  constructed  to  cast  the  black  man  as sub-human, inevitably resulted in certain black responses. Pride in blackness was lacking, and among black men of achievement, it was vital that a sense of dignity, and pride in rate, in the face of degradation should be emphasised and organised.

Among those in the African diaspora, there had to be a 'son of Africa' committed to redeeming the good name and humanity of the African and his people as a whole. In response to James Anthony Froude's negrophobe travel  book The  English  in  the  West  Indies (1888),  J.  J.  Thomas,  a Trinidadian  schoolmaster  wrote Froudacity,  West  Indian  Fables  by  James Anthony  Froude  Explained .  This  well  stated  argument,  however,  was  not enough.  While  many  had  thought  of  the  idea,  few  or  none  had  acted  on behalf of the African peoples until Henry Sylvester Williams, a Trinidadian, became aware of this need while he was in London.

Williams  was  born  in  Arouca,  Trinidad,  in  1869  where  the  villagers were mainly of African descent. At that time, slavery had been abolished for some 30 years. In fact, there were people alive when he was growing up who had experienced the 'middle passage' and others who had been born in slavery in Trinidad. Moreover, there were those who had come to Trinidad as 'recaptives'. Many of these Africans were taken from slave ships by the Royal  Navy's  antislave  squadron  and  transported  to  Sierra  Leone  for settlement. In Williams's young mind, Africa and his Africanness were real. The African  form  of  worship, African  drums  and  dances  formed  part  of Trinidadian village life. All this, however, was being increasingly undermined.

British colonial rule had the effect of making Trinidad (and other West Indian colonies) less African, less French and more English. For some, like Williams,  Africa  was  indelibly  written  in  his  youth  and  early  manhood. Issues affecting Africa and Africans did not go unnoticed in Trinidad. The Rev Henry Doughlin told a meeting in San Fernando on 1 August 1888 that it was  the  duty  of  every  African  man  in  Trinidad  to  help  in  Africa's conversion. The fact that Williams knew there were African princes in the land of his ancestors raised many questions. He was particularly concerned with the fact that he had heard only the praises and rituals of white royalty. This troubled him even more because he lived under the British Crown and had received a British education. At the time, agitation for self-government was growing. There were riots and clashes in the early 1880s when James Anthony  Froude  (the  Oxford  University  Professor  of  Modern  History) derided  Trinidadians  and  their  aspirations  to  self-rule  in  his  book The English  in  the  West  Indies .  Among  other  things,  this  sneering  observer considered a constitution with a Black minister and a Black legislature as unthinkable.  What  the  ill-informed  Froude  did  not  know  at  the  time  was

that Trinidad was regarded as the land of chronic agitation for reform. 29 His view of self-government and Trinidadians (as a people) was a reflection of what English politicians and officials (who controlled the political destiny of the island) firmly believed. Williams came to realise this later when he tried to press upon the Colonial Office the case for reform of the Trinidad legislature. Following the 'great reform meeting' black consciousness was heightened during 1888 and 1889.

- J.  J.  Thomas's  book Froudacity was  a  clear  exposition,  which  left  no doubt  of  pride  in  his  blackness  and  concern  for  his  race,  wherever  its members lived. Williams, then only 20 years old, was one of many black readers  of Froudacity . During  this  period,  Thomas's  thoughts  had  an influence on Williams, then a young schoolteacher. Thomas was preoccupied with Africa, the birthplace of his parents and 'the cradle of our race'. He felt, as would others after him, that black people in the Western hemisphere would be better off in Africa. Thus, the back to Africa and Pan African thoughts of Thomas had a major influence on Williams who in turn developed and set the idea in motion, through practical organisation.

After some teaching experience in Trinidad, at the age of 22, Williams went to the United States. As a newcomer, he took a keen interest in the situation of Afro-Americans who were discriminated against, denied equal rights,  terrorised  and  lynched.  He  was  also  concerned  with  the  increasing disenfranchisement of Blacks in the South. In 1891, there were only three Blacks in Congress. But the independence of Blacks was evident in religion and in the formation of a black press. This impressed him. The New York Age , for  example,  focused  attention  on  black  church  activities,  black politics and significantly A. M. E. Bishop Henry McNeal Turner campaigned  for  black  emigration  to  Africa.  It  was  a  time  when  'Africa fever' was spreading among Blacks in the South. Among many there was a strong desire to emigrate to Liberia.

It is more than likely then, that given the wide publicity surrounding it, Williams  was  aware  of  Bishop  Turner's  back  to  Africa  plan  which  was criticised by the New York Age ,  although it was admitted that the idea had 'stirred up unusual interest'. Turner advocated the emigration of '100,000 to 150,000 of the coloured race'. 30

Such  factors  as  racial  barriers  and  the  lack  of  congenial  work  ended Williams's  study  in  the  United  States.  He  had  earned  enough  money  to

begin his studies when he moved to Canada, where he entered Dalhousie University  in  1893.  There  he  was  registered  as  a  general  student  in  the faculty  of  law  during  the  1893-4  session.  Unfortunately,  very  little  is known of his activities as a student at Dalhousie.

In 1896, however, he arrived in England and enrolled at King's College, London where (as at Dalhousie) there has been no trace of his enrolment from the college records. By all accounts Williams had to live frugally. It was not long before he immersed himself in events concerning Africa. His interest  was  encouraged  by  the  protests  of  the  humanitarian  and  liberal interests  with  which  he  was  to  identify.  As  it  was,  1896  was  especially notable in African affairs. 31

While atrocities were being committed in Africa, the English publicist, William  J.  Stead,  editor  of  the Review  of  Reviews ,  pleaded  for  'lenient judgement' for  his  fellow  Englishmen  who  were  'at  the  front  bearing  the heat and burden of the day'. Ironically, Stead also believed in the 'civilising mission' of his race. 32

Although Williams was active in public affairs, he pursued his ambition of reading for the Bar, enrolling at Gray's Inn on 10 December 1897. It was at Gray's Inn that he delivered his first address as Honorary Secretary of the African Association which he had formed. Having forged this link of black brotherhood, it seemed he felt free to enter the bond of inter-racial marriage. He considered no race to be superior to the 'Negro' race. In 1898, at the age of  29,  he  married  a  white  woman, Agnes  Powell,  in  spite  of  her  father's disapproval.

In order to fill the need for a 'body of Africans in England representing native opinion on national matters affecting the destiny of the African race', he founded the African Association on 24 September 1897. The purposes of the Association were:

to encourage a feeling of unity and to facilitate friendly intercourse among Africans in general; to promote and protect the interests of all  subjects  claiming African  descent,  wholly  or  in  part,  in  British colonies  and  other  places, especially in  Africa, by  circulating accurate  information  on  all subjects affecting their rights and privileges as subjects of the British Empire, by direct appeals to the imperial and local Governments. 33

Moreover, the Association's scope was restricted to British subjects and it proposed to protect their rights by appealing to both the British and colonial governments to redress their wrongs.

Predictably, good  wishes  for the future of the Association were counteracted by other comments. The detractors - 'certain English persons' - did not expect the Association to last more than three months, essentially because  they  could  not  see  black  people  uniting  for  such  a  purpose. However, Williams was confident, insisting that the Association would act on its own, draft its own rules, and not be led by Europeans. Although the Association was beset by difficulties, it managed to survive for four years.

Williams acted in keeping with the Association's pledge to protect the interests  of  his African  brethren  by  contacting  well  disposed  MPs  to  ask questions about colonial conditions, particularly in South Africa. He wrote to Chamberlain about the welfare of Africans in Rhodesia and to newspapers such as The Leader on behalf of the Association. He criticised the British government for condoning the introduction of slavery in South Africa  under  the  leadership  of  Cecil  Rhodes.  British  policy  was  clearly questionable  and  he  appealed  to  the  nation  on  behalf  of  the  African Association,  to  lobby  their  representatives  to  bring  about  fairness  and justice to Blacks. He carefully trod the racial path. He did not advocate a complete westernisation of Africa; he was prepared to adopt only what was of value in the European culture while retaining the best of his own. This balancing  of  the  modern  with  the  traditional  would  become  a  recurring theme in the development of Pan Africanism.

In  seeking  a  reversal  of  British  policies  in  the  colonies,  as  imperial power  expanded,  Williams's  task  seemed  hopeless.  Nevertheless,  he  was optimistic; indeed, he had bigger plans.

The African Association's activities spurred the call which was issued as early as 1898 for a Pan African Conference in 1900. Williams had, in fact, conceived of the idea of a world conference of black people in 1897, well before  the  formation  of  the African Association  which  gave  it  credibility. But  he  was  aware  that  his  plans  could  only  materialise  if  he  could  get people to come to London. He thought that the Conference could only get off the ground if he could induce 'representatives of the race' to make the trip.  Some  other  important  event  in  Europe  might  be  helpful.  The  great Exposition which the French were planning to open in Paris in April 1900 was an occasion which might attract Blacks. Williams reasoned that those

Blacks who were going to Paris might be induced to combine their trip with a visit to London for the Conference. This they did.

As preparations for the Conference got under way on 19 March 1898, the African Association issued a circular announcing the intention 'to hold a conference  in  the  month  of  May  (1900)  …  in  order  to  take  steps  to influence  public  opinion  on  existing  proceedings  and  conditions  affecting the welfare of the Natives of the various parts of the British Empire, viz. South  Africa,  West  Africa  and  the  British  West  Indies'. 34 Attention  was focused on conditions in those lands under British rule for which the British government was responsible and for which it was answerable to Parliament.

The  original  Conference  date,  set  for  May  1900  because  of  the  Paris Exposition, was changed on the advice of a number of 'leading men' of the race from Africa, the United States and the West Indies who, while visiting London  for  various  reasons,  attended  a  preparatory  meeting  of  the  Pan African Conference Committee on 12 June 1899. July was more suitable to them and the Committee agreed that the dates should be 23, 24 and 25 July, noting carefully the opening of the World's Christian Endeavour Convention  on  16  July.  Some  of  the  'leading  men'  who  advised  the Committee constitute 'a galaxy of remarkable men': Bishop James T. Holly, Bishop James Johnson, Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, the Rev Dr Majola Agbebi, the Rev C. W. Farquhar, Judge David Augustus Straker, Professor W.  S.  Scarborough,  Henry  Richard  Cargill,  J.  Tengo  Jabavu,  J.  Otonba Payne and Professor Booker T. Washington. 35

In naming  the  Conference,  it  would  seem  that  Williams  and  his associates  were  aware  of  the  Pan-Slav  movement,  the  oldest  of  the  'pan' movements which held a demonstration in Prague in 1898. Of course, there was  also the pan-German  movement  which  sought  to  stimulate  the patriotism  of  race,  to  emphasise  the  solidarity  of  all  German  speaking peoples and to prepare for their political union.

Africans  from  the  diaspora  had  increasingly  begun  to  question  the validity of European oppression. J. M. Bourne was perhaps the only English member of the African Association, and it is possible that sharp criticism of British imperial policy was not always well received by him. However, as the date of the Conference drew near, the task of organising it was entrusted to the Pan African Committee.

The lack of support from the Anti-Slavery Society did not discourage Williams and his supporters. Funds were coming in and the arrangements were going as planned. The Conference was well-timed for those who were also  attending  the  Universal  Paris  Exposition  and  the  World  Christian Endeavour Convention in London. These two events increased the credibility of actually holding the Pan African Conference. For example, W. E.  DuBois  who  prepared  part  of  the American  Negro  exhibit  at  the  Paris Exposition travelled to London. Similar coincidental factors were to recur at the historic 1945 Pan African Congress. Thus, the stage was set.

At a meeting held before the opening of the Conference Williams said that  the  Conference  would  be  'the  first  occasion  upon  which  black  men would  assemble  in  England  to  speak  for  themselves  and  endeavour  to influence  public  opinion  in  their  favour'.  He  specified  the  position  of Blacks in South Africa, warning that their interests must not be overlooked in any settlement reached after the South African war. 36

When the Pan African Conference finally met in 1900, imperialism had reached its zenith. By then Britain had added the following territories to its Empire: Nigeria, Asante, British East Africa (Kenya), Uganda, Nyasaland, Rhodesia and Bechuanaland in Africa; the Sudan, Somaliland and Zanzibar in the Islamic world; and North Borneo, Sarawak, Pahang, Kowloon, Weihai-wai  and  Burma  in  the  Far  East.  Further,  Britain  also  held  extraterritorial rights in thirty-five Chinese cities. Of these territories, none was self-governed. War was everywhere. 37

Bishop  Walters  opened  the  first  Pan  African  Conference  on  23  July 1900. His opening address dealt thoughtfully with 'The Trials and Tribulations of the Coloured Race in America', thus setting the tone of the Conference.  'For  the  first  time  in  history',  he  said,  'Blacks  had  gathered from all parts of the globe to discuss how to improve the condition of the race, to assert the rights of blacks and to organise them so that they might take an equal place among nations.' He argued that in the United States it had been their misfortune to live among a people whose laws, traditions and prejudices  had  always  been  against  Blacks.  It  had  taken  the  Black  two hundred  years  to  gain  personal  emancipation  and  one  hundred  years  to attain standing as a soldier. It would hardly be expected, therefore, that he would get  his  complete  social  and  political  rights  in  35  years.  The  black people in the United States had been able nevertheless to eliminate 45 per

cent of their illiteracy and they now owned $735 million in real estate and personal  property.  And  they  were  now  engaged  in  a  long  and  severe struggle for full social and political rights. 38

In opening the proceedings of the third and final day, Walters spoke in recognition  of  the  services  Whites  in  England  and  the  United  States rendered to the cause of black people. He closed the discussion by saying that  the  object  of  the  Conference  was  to  secure  moral,  political  and  civil rights for Blacks. The force of numbers, he argued, was on their side. The Conference was just the beginning of the work, and it meant that Blacks everywhere would organise for their betterment.

The  first Committee  report  (read  and  adopted)  recommended  the formation  of  a  permanent  Pan  African  Association  with  headquarters  in London  and  branches  overseas.  The  intention  was  that  the  Association would  convene  a  general  meeting  every  second  year  in  a  large  city  in Europe or America or in an independent black state. It was decided that the next meeting would be held in the United States in 1902, and in Haiti in 1904  'to  add  to  the  solemnity  of  the  centenary  celebration  of  Haitian freedom'. 39 Agreement  was  also  reached  to  the  effect  that  the  African Association  would  merge  into  the  new  Pan African Association  and  that other organisations, in existence, whose aims were similar to those of the Pan African Association  would  be  affiliated  on  formal  application  to  the Executive.

The aims and objects of the Pan African Association were:

- 1. To secure to Africans throughout the world true civil and political rights;
- 2. To ameliorate the condition of our brothers on the continent of Africa, America and other parts of the world;
- 3. To  promote  efforts  to  secure  effective  legislation  and  encourage  our  people  in  educational, industrial and commercial enterprise;
- 4. To foster the production of writing and statistics relating to our people everywhere; and
- 5. To raise funds for forwarding these purposes. 40

A matter of importance was the fact that the Conference unanimously adopted an 'Address to the Nations of the World'. The Address appealed to the great powers of the civilised world, expressed faith in 'the wide spirit of humanity and the deep sense of justice' and called for an end to colour and race  prejudice.  The  delegates  of  the  Conference  also  sent  a  separate memorial to Queen Victoria calling for an end to the discrimination against Blacks in South Africa. Moreover, the Address called on Britain to give 'as

soon  as  practicable  the  rights  of  responsible  government  to  the  black colonies of Africa and the West Indies'. The questions of race and colour weighed heavily on the mind of Joseph Chamberlain who regarded Blacks in the West Indies as 'totally unfit for representative institutions'.

The  Address  also  called  for  protection  of  the  American  Negro  from oppression and to grant him 'the right of franchise' and 'security of person and property'. It also called for the Congo Free State of King Leopold to 'become a great central Negro State of the World'.

Finally  the  Address  called  on  the  imperialist  nations  to  respect  the integrity and independence of the free 'Negro' States of Abyssinia, Liberia and Haiti. In addition the Conference sent a memorial on the ill-treatment of Africans and coloureds in South Africa, directly to Queen Victoria. It stated that  the  Pan  African  Conference  comprising  men  and  women  of African blood and descent, respectfully invited her 'august and sympathetic attention to the fact that the situation of the native races in South Africa is causing  us  and  our  friends  alarm'.  In  fact,  the  delegates  expressed  many concerns. 41

After the Conference, organisation of the new Pan African Association was Williams's main task. Among his immediate duties were arranging for the submission  of the memorial  to Queen  Victoria, despatching the 'Address  to  the  Nations',  the  memorials  to  Emperor  Menelik  and  the Presidents  of  Liberia  and  Haiti,  and  the  resolutions  passed  and  letters  of thanks  for  the  assistance  given.  Williams  found  time  to  attend  the  AntiSlavery Congress in Paris. In addition to completing the Conference report, he  was  engaged  in  completing  his  studies  for  the  Bar  final  examination. Between his finals and the Paris visit, the Association was able to establish a permanent headquarters with a bureau 'to disseminate facts and statistics relating to the circumstances and conditions of members of the African race wherever found'. 42

Financially the Conference was unsuccessful, although Williams solicited  and  received  contributions  from  many  sympathetic  persons.  In spite of the problem  of  the  lack  of  funds,  Williams  was  especially concerned about the 'acute ill-treatment of the natives of South Africa' and in  line  with  the  Pan African  Conference  decision,  he  sent  a  memorial  to Queen Victoria. The fact that there was no reply to this memorial disturbed the  Executive Committee. Consequently, Williams was instructed to write

to the  Queen  early  in  1901  enquiring  whether  she  had  received  the memorial. On  17  January, he received a letter from Chamberlain's Secretary, saying that Chamberlain had received 'the Queen's commands to inform you that the memorial of the Pan African Association regarding the situation  of  the  native  races  in  South  Africa  has  been  laid  before  her Majesty and that she was graciously pleased to command him to return an answer to it on behalf of her government'. Chamberlain asked Williams to assure the members of the Pan African Conference that 'in settling the lines on which the administration of conquered territories is to be conducted, Her Majesty's government will not overlook the interests of the native races'. The  letter  also  stated  that  a  copy  of  the  memorial  was  sent  to  the  High Commissioner in South Africa.

Satisfied with this reply that 'the interests of the native races' will not be overlooked,  Williams  sent  the  text  of  the  letter  to The  Times which published it the following day under the heading 'The South African Native Question'  with  an  introductory  paragraph  referring  to  the  Pan  African Conference  and  to  the  General  Secretary  as  'The  Rev  Henry  Sylvester Williams'. Unfortunately, while the memorial mentioned conditions among the  natives  of  South  Africa,  Chamberlain's  reply  referred  only  to  the settlement in the 'conquered territories' such as the Transvaal and Orange River. 43 The fact that this was not a direct reply to the memorial was not surprising since Chamberlain's  views  on  Blacks  generally  were  well known. Acknowledgement of the letter was clearly not enough. Soon after Williams received the reply, the Queen died. During her reign the British Empire expanded by robbery, violence, deceit and forced labour, taking the wealth from the less advanced lands. Yet Williams, the Anglophile, felt that black people should revere the memory of the Queen 'because her first act on ascending the throne was the absolute emancipation of their people and her  very  last  act  was  in  connection  with  them'. 44 Relying  on  favourable British public opinion, Williams was later to see that such an opinion was formed precisely by the promises and deceit of such men as Chamberlain.

Williams  continued  his  work  for  the  Association  by  travelling  to Jamaica,  Trinidad  and  the  United  States  in  an  effort  to  spread  the  word. Branches  were  formed  and,  at  meetings,  subscriptions  were  collected  to fund Pan African , the monthly magazine that Williams hoped to publish in London. While he was in Trinidad, a month after leaving the Association's headquarters in London, 'certain colleagues' had dissolved the Pan African

Association 'on the pretext of lack of funds' and announced it to the press. Although  this  'illegality'  affected  Williams  deeply,  he  made  no  public announcement in Trinidad.

Soon after Williams returned to London on 4 September a meeting was convened  with  members  of  the  Association  on  13  September,  and  they announced  that  the  Pan African Association  would  continue  and  that  the members  elected  to  the  Executive  Committee  would  replace  those  who were 'considered to have resigned'. 46 It was also announced that Williams would continue as General Secretary until 1902 when the next Conference was due in the United States.

Although  Williams  notified  overseas  members,  the  Association  never appeared to have functioned. And while little was known of the fate of the Anglo-Africa Association there is  no  evidence  that  it  functioned  either  in Jamaica  or  in  Trinidad.  The  Pan  African  Association  branches,  however, continued in operation until mid-1902.

In  an  effort  to  keep  the  Association  alive,  Williams  sought  publicity which  he  hoped  would  help  to  enlighten  the  Whites  and  expose  racial inequities.  There  was  no  black  press  through  which  grievances  could  be expressed. Since Blacks had no representation in Parliament, a black-owned newspaper  was  essential.  Conscious  of  these  failings,  Williams  published the  first  issue  of The Pan African in  October  1901. This  monthly  journal dealt  with  matters  'concerning  the  interests  of  the African  descendants  in the British Empire'. Although this approach was similar to the position of the 'Anglo-Africans', it was argued that 'this stance was probably adopted merely  for  convenience  and  was  not  an  abandonment  of  the  Pan African idea'. 47 Be that as it may, Williams was the editor.

Whatever lessons he may have learnt about an independent black press in  the  United  States  was  of  no  avail  in  England.  The  history  of  the Pan African was short and obscure. Ambitiously, the Pan African sought a wide public among Africans, Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. So much so that in February  1902,  a printer in Trinidad, Edgar  McCarthy,  was appointed  local  agent.  But,  by  mid-April  of  that  year,  Williams's  brother was the only person who had to hand 'the back numbers' of the six issues that were printed. No more was heard of the magazine.

While working on the Pan African Williams prepared for his call to the Bar. In the meantime he continued to give public lectures on the status of

the  African  in  the  British  Empire.  On  the  question  of  the  Boer  War, Williams, who felt that the treatment meted out to Blacks by the Boers was one of the principal causes of the war, expected the situation to be resolved following  a  British  victory.  Was  he  yet  again  being  naive  about  British imperialism?

Williams later became involved in municipal politics as a member of the Marylebone Borough Council. His mind was set on a political career. To further his ambition he became a member of the prestigious Liberal Club. While his  scope  in  Borough  Council  politics  was  limited  he  held  out  the brave  hope  of  parliamentary  representation  for  Blacks.  With  a  tiny  black electorate in London, Williams needed a white majority to be elected. He was  fortunate  in  that  his  links  with  the  trade  union  members  among  his colleagues  appeared  to  have  been  closer  than  his  fellow  Progressive candidates, and he had the backing of the General Secretary of the Workers' Union. Eventually, he won a seat, 'becoming probably the first Negro man to be elected to public office in Britain'. For the Progressives in Marylebone, however, and especially the Ward 3 area, the election was a disaster. The Conservatives were jubilant. The Pall Mall Gazette commented on the 'sharp reverses' of Keir Hardie's party whose policy was based on 'an arrogant and ambitious communism'. The Progressives were described as 'socialistic'. 48

As  a  municipal  councillor,  Williams  settled  down  to  work  serving  on two standing committees, legal and parliamentary and housing. Service as a councillor,  however,  did  not  deflect  his  interest  and  devotion  to  African affairs. After a spell of 'protecting Liberian interests' Williams left Africa. Moreover,  he  had  to  abandon  an  unfinished  project  for  a  black  students' club in Oxford - a kind of Pan African students' club - and discontinued his role  as  black  spokesman  in  England.  For  some  unexplained  reason,  he chose to return to his native Trinidad, a small white-dominated colony on the periphery of the British Empire. As it was, Trinidad and Africa were the focal points of interest during his organisational work and representations. To further the ambitious cause of Pan Africanism from this setting was most unlikely.  According  to  his  biographer,  Williams  'perhaps  prematurely, popularised  the  vocabulary  of  black  grievance,  coined  a  useful  phrase, challenged conventional notions regarding Africa and called for a new sort of  British  Empire.  Today's  Commonwealth  would  have  seemed  to  him  a logical outgrowth of his ideas. He was certain that black people were the

equals of any set of humans, and he could point to a large number including himself, who already had demonstrated the proposition. He sought justice and fair competition. He was, finally, a decent and generous man.' 49 Indeed, it can be asserted that he influenced W. E. B. DuBois.

His biographer concludes, 'One who writes about Pan Africanism must write  about  Williams,  but  none  of  the  literature  has.' 50 Like  Thorne  and others (until recently) his work in calling the crucial Pan  African Conference remained largely unknown. These early beginnings initiated in Britain, particularly by Thorne and Williams in the nineteenth century, led to  the  development  and  'dilemma'  of  Pan  Africanism  in  the  twentieth century.

PART TWO:

The 'Black Man's' Burden (1900-1962)

## 4 Britain, Empire and Labour

After the Second World War, one observer wrote that British imperialism, in extreme decay, was not yet finished but strove to adopt many new forms and techniques to meet new conditions, not in order to commit suicide or liquidate itself, but to continue to promote the age-old aims of extracting the super-profits of colonial exploitation. 1

While the British  colonial  system  is  older  than  British  capitalism,  the post-war  Empire,  essentially  a  modern  growth,  dates  back  to  the  late eighteenth century. Indeed, it was through the 'old colonial system' that the primary capital accumulated, making possible the Industrial Revolution. As Marx  put  it,  'The  colonial  system  ripened,  like  a  hothouse,  trade  and navigation  …  The  treasures  captured  outside  Europe  by  undisguised looting,  enslavement  and  murder,  floated  back  to  the  mother  country  and were  there  turned  into  capital.' 2 In  turn,  the  old  colonial  monopoly  was overtaken by world-industrial monopoly. Thus through manipulation of the means  of production and the improvements  in communications, the bourgeoisie of the 'uncivilised' nations (India, Africa and the East and West Indies)  were  drawn  into  'civilisation'.  The  exploitation  and  oppression endemic  in  this  binding  relationship  was  expressed  in  Marx  and  Engels' Communist Manifesto .

Through  these  developments  then,  Britain's  nineteenth  century  world industrial monopoly effected a new phase in the colonial system. This was also a dual system: on the one hand, there were the Dominions (Canada and Australia) where  British  settlers either exterminated  or  displaced  the original inhabitants to become the colonial wing of the British; on the other, there were the conquered and the enslaved colonial countries which served as sources of cheap raw materials extracted through the plantation system and by peasant labour under semi-starvation conditions. These colonies also served  as  markets  for  British  exports.  Flooding  the  local  markets  with British  goods  led,  in  large  measure,  to  the  ruin  of  the  native  handicraft industries.

Britain's  economic power seemed enviable until the Great Depression of the 1870s when, for the first time, the supremacy of British exports was weakened by powerful new industrial rivals - first the United States, then Germany. This competition resulted in an extension of the export of capital and the scramble for new colonial possessions. Thus, the way was prepared for the twentieth century era of imperialism.

In 1880 British steel output stood at 1.3 million tons, that of the USA at 1.2 million and Germany's at 700,000. By 1900 American steel output had reached 10.2 million tons, German 6.4 million and the British 4.9 million. By  1913 American  steel  output  reached  31.3  million  tons,  German  18.9 million and British 7.7 million. However, Britain still maintained the first position  in  the  export  of  manufactured  goods  although  with  a  lessening proportion. But, in the export of capital and colonial expansion, Britain was far ahead.

Between 1884 and 1900 Britain acquired 3,700,000 square miles of new colonial territories. By 1914 the British Empire covered 12.7 million square miles,  with  a  population  of  431  millions,  of  which  the  White  Dominions totalled  60  million.  A  further  one  and  a  half  million  square  miles  were acquired through the imperialist war of 1914-18. Thus, by the eve of the Second  World  War  the  British  Empire's  protectorates  and  dependencies, covered approximately one-quarter of the earth's surface and one-quarter of the world's population. 3 In effect, the era of industrial capital gave way to the era of finance capital. Britain still remained the great colonial exploiter.

This exploitation was vital to Britain. In the face of a rising challenge from  the  British  working  class,  Lenin  quoted  Cecil  Rhodes  as  saying  in 1895:

I was in the East End of London yesterday and I attended a meeting of the 'unemployed'. I listened to the wild speeches which were just a cry for 'bread', 'bread', 'bread', and on my way home I pondered over  the  scene  and  I  became  more  than  ever  convinced  of  the importance of imperialism … My cherished idea is a solution for the social  problem.  In  order  to  save  the  40,000,000  inhabitants  of  the UK from a bloody civil war, we, colonial statesmen, must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for  the  goods  produced  by  them  in  the  factories  and  mines.  The Empire, as I have always said, is a bread and butter question. If you want to avoid civil war, you must become an imperialist. 4

## East Indian labour: the abolition of indentureship

The  change  in  the  Indian  indentured  labourers'  circumstances  came  only with  the  change  in  sugar  production.  The  shift  towards  fewer  estates  and larger,  central  sugar  mills  resulted  in  a  movement  from  an  estate-based population into a rural small-holder or peasant population. This modification of the plantation system gave some freedom from its pervasive grip. The system came under increasing scrutiny and pressure. There was a 'long, long period' during which  it was  questioned  and  challenged. Mohandas  K.  Gandhi  was  right  in  identifying  Lord  Curzon  as  the  first Viceroy of India to see that the indentured Indians were mere helots of the Empire and the first to question the system. Gandhi's own attempts in South Africa  helped  to  highlight  some  of  the  problems  of  the  Indians  as  an important political issue. Thus, both Gandhi and Curzon called the system into question.

The movement to abolish Indian indentureship was gathering momentum. In South Africa, the Indians were on the march; in Mauritius, they were moved to periodic protest; but in the Caribbean the only political movement was that of the Creole Blacks. In Trinidad, the Working Men's Association was opposed to further Indian immigration as a threat to wages and  living  standards.  And  in  British  Guiana,  the  Peoples'  Association,  a black organisation, protested against taxation levied to promote immigration. 5 It was  against  this  background  of  colonial  resistance  to indentured labour that the Sanderson Committee began its work.

Gandhi's struggle against oppressive laws in South Africa had become a mass campaign of Satyagraha, in which the majority of participants were indentured and ex-indentured Indians. At last, through exceptional leadership, given the historical moment, the coolies were being mobilised. By 1913, the atmosphere was highly charged by the news that Gandhi had launched his most massive Satyagraha campaign. His main appeal was to the indentured coolies employed in the Dundee and Newcastle districts of Natal. The labourers abandoned their work and marched with Gandhi to the Transvaal  border.  Over  200  were  arrested,  including  Gandhi  who  was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. 6

This news  reached Whitehall and Delhi quickly. Lord Hardinge responded  in  an  extraordinary  speech  stating  that  the  Indians  in  South Africa  'have  violated,  as  they  intended  to  violate,  those  laws,  with  full knowledge of the penalties involved. … In all this they have the sympathies of India - deep and burning - and not only of India but of those who like myself  …  have  feelings  of  sympathy  for  the  people  of  this  country.' 7 Having  made  this  pronouncement  which,  understandably  was  'open  to criticism'  (because  it  came  'straight  from  the  heart'),  the  British  Cabinet considered his recall from India, but did not want to precipitate an Indian backlash. Against this background of events, the McNeill and Chimman Lal Report  on  the Condition  of  Indian  Immigrants  in  Four  British  Colonies: Trinidad,  British  Guiana,  Jamaica  and  Fiji and  in  the  Dutch  colony  of Surinam was considered.

While  Gandhi  (who  was  preparing  to  return  to  India)  recognised  the importance  of  the  Viceroy's  intervention,  with  Indian  independence  in mind,  he  attached  greater  importance  to  Satyagraha.  Subsequently,  the McNeill and Chimman Lal report was circulated and the First World War intervened.  By  1915,  Indian  feeling  about  emigration  was  only  partly aroused. In January, Gandhi had returned to India. There, several organisations  were  founded  especially  to  fight  coolie  emigration. Among them  were  the  Indian  Coolie  Protection  Society  and  the  Anti-Indentured Emigration  League  of  Bengal.  Later,  other  organisations  joined  in  the protest such as the Home Rule League, the Bengal Province Congress, the UP Congress, the League for the Abolition of Indentured Emigration, the Anti-Indenture  League  of  Madras  and  the  Punjab  Provincial  Moslem

League. 8

Moreover,  during  January  and  February  1917,  Gandhi  continued  to speak  out  against  indenture.  He  was  suspicious  that  the  Government  of India might keep the system going for another five years and pressed for a definite early date for complete abolition.

Finally,  in  1917,  Indian  indenture  had  officially  ended.  But,  Indians were still bound by indenture in the sugar colonies: a continuing servitude that was  unacceptable  to  the  Indian  public. In December,  1919,  all outstanding indentures were terminated in British Guiana. Still outstanding, however, was the fact that the indenture system as a working reality had to be cleared away, once and for all. In theory, at least, the labourers were free. Ironically, many  Indians  having  pined  for  their  homeland,  eventually returned to India to find that industrial conditions there, after the famine of 1920,  had  been  unfavourable.  The  returned  emigrants  experienced  great difficulty in obtaining suitable employment. Many of them were colonialborn  and  found  themselves  utter  strangers  in  the  country.  The  India-born found that their long residence in the colonies had rendered them unfit for the old social conditions. These repatriates, after spending all their savings drifted back to Calcutta in the hope of finding ships to take them back to their homes in the sugar colonies. 9

Thus,  the  indentured  coolies,  many  of  them  long  forgotten,  returned home to realise a state of hopelessness. Strangely, the familiar bounds of the plantations offered the only hope. And so the Indian diaspora, achieved a settled,  permanent  foothold,  existing  side  by  side  with Africans  in Africa and in the African diaspora.

Thereafter, Indians continued to emigrate. Their concern was not with the  colonies  where  the  Indians  remained  the  working  poor.  Instead,  they looked  towards  East  and  South  Africa  where  the  Indians  were  trying  to establish  themselves  as  urban  middle  class  communities.  Their  attention was directed especially to East Africa, to Kenya and Uganda.

The first major threat to reduce the status of overseas Indians emerged in  Kenya where the white settlers plotted to force the hand of the British government. The Indians were now mostly traders. Despite protest and nonco-operation,  the  East  African  Indians  were  forced  to  accept  an  uneasy middle position between the Europeans, at the top, and the Africans at the bottom; clearly an unsettled and unsettling buffer position.

In  South Africa  during  the  1920s,  the  Indian  community  came  under attack as legislation eroded their rights; those who left the country could not return,  and  dependants  were  denied  entry. They  were  profoundly  affected by  the  Class  Areas  Bill,  introduced  in  1925,  which  confined  Indians  to separate  residential  and  commercial  areas.  The  Indian  government  and politicians  protested  loudly.  Yet,  they  could  do  little  to  confront  South African racism effectively. Motilal Nehru told the Indian Congress in 1928 that the best way to help Indians overseas was to act 'to gain our freedom here'. Clearly then, colonial exploitation had to continue, though it would be tempered by grudging concessions to colonial labour.

Twentieth century politicians, certainly by the end of the Second World War, were unanimous that the Empire was the essential economic base on which the British working class would be saved from starvation. In 1929, Winston Churchill, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, was able to say that the social services in Britain was dependent on the income from imperialist exploitation. 10 Lord  Cranbourne,  the  Dominions  Secretary,  reminded  the British  people  that  their  employment  and  standard  of  living  depended mainly on the existence of the Empire. And in 1946, the Labour trade union leader, Ernest Bevin told the House of Commons that he was not prepared to sacrifice the British Empire for if it fell it would mean a considerable fall in the standard of living of 'our constituents'. 11

It  emerges very clearly from these statements that the exploitation and degradation of the colonial working class was an indispensable requirement in maintaining the standard of living of the British working class. Implicit in  this  argument  is  the  fact  that  the  British  economy  is  really  a  'parasitic economy' dependent on colonial revenues for its maintenance. The concentration on foreign investment, as opposed to industrial renewal, and neglect of home investment would have serious repercussions. For so long as  the  British  ruling  class  could  amass  huge  profits  (at  the  expense  of minimum and starvation level standards of living in the colonies) attention was  deflected  from  the  growing  neglect  of  industrial  and  agricultural investment in Britain. Indeed, there was every reason for optimism that the British working class would continue to benefit from colonial exploitation. Before  the  First  World  War  nearly  one-fifth  of  British  imports  were  no longer paid for by exports of goods. And on the eve of the Second World War nearly two-fifths of British imports were no longer paid for by exports of goods. The import surplus (or invisible balance of trade) rose from £30

million in 1855-59 to £134 million in 1913 to £302 million in 1938, and £438 million in 1947. Initially, this import surplus was covered by income from  overseas  investment  such  as  financial  commissions  and  shipping. Later,  however,  the  tide  had  turned  to  the  extent  that  even  the  overseas income could not cover the unpaid imports. Consequently, in the late 1930s, a  net  deficit  on  the  balance  of  payments  reached  £380  million  and  £630 million in 1947. 12

If  imperialism  means  violent  aggression,  then  the  imperialist  basis  of the  British  economy  was  clearly  founded  on  an  unstable  dependence  on colonial  exploitation.  Repressive  force  exerted  over  the  colonial  working classes was,  sooner  or  later, bound  to  lead  to  violent  reaction.  The disturbances  or  'riots',  as  they  were  called,  in  India,  Africa,  Trinidad, Jamaica  and  elsewhere  in  the  West  Indies,  during  the  decades  before  the Second World War, were symptomatic of the weakness of British imperialism. Increasingly, as cracks appeared in the system, costly military manoeuvres  were  required  to  maintain  law  and  order  in  the  colonies. Consequently,  there  was  neglect  and  decay  of  British  home  industries. Thus, the first industrial nation, once 'the workshop of the world', lagged behind the United States of America and Germany, with an accumulation of obsolete  machinery  and  equipment.  The  coal  industry,  for  example,  was 'worse than stagnant' before 1900, and textiles machinery was notoriously obsolete  in  the  majority  of  factories.  This  lag  was  both  absolute  and relative. 13

Between  the  wars  this  deterioriation  accelerated.  Coal  production  fell from 287 million tons in 1913 to 230 million in 1938. Between 1920 and 1935  fourteen  million  spindles  were  destroyed;  one-third  of  the  British shipyards  were  closed  down  and  British  shipping  capacity  was  reduced from three to two million tons annually. Moreover, in agriculture between 1918  and  1938,  over  two  million  acres  of  arable  land  went  out  of cultivation. 14

But in spite of the decay of the basic industries, secondary and luxury services expanded. As the proportion of the working population engaged in production in the basic industries fell from 23 per cent in 1851 to 13.6 per cent in 1929, the numbers employed in commercial and financial operations, distribution, office employment and a variety of 'services' rose continually.  Thus,  from  these  secondary  industries  a  'new  middle  class'

emerged.  By  1937  the  'foreign  investment'  which  made  this  prosperity possible  was  described  by  the Economist as  'the  nation's  greatest  single industry'. 15

The  consequence  of  this  'new  middle  class'  was  to  act  as  a  buffer between  the  decline  and  depression  of  the  productive  working  class  in industry. This transformation in the productive base of the British economy had  restructured  and  divided  the  British  working  class.  In  the  labour hierarchy,  based  on  imperialism,  British  working  class  solidarity  was difficult  to  achieve,  with  the  upper  section  opposing  the  lower.  Lenin's observation of this in the early twentieth century was revealing:

In Great Britain the tendency of imperialism to divide the toilers … to  encourage  opportunism  amongst  them  and  to  give  rise  to  a temporary organic decay in the working class movement, revealed itself much earlier than the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth  centuries.  For  two  big  distinctive  features  of imperialism applied to Britain from midway through the nineteenth century: vast colonial possessions and a monopolist position in the world markets. Marx and Engels systematically followed, over some decades  this  relation  between  working  class  opportunism  and  the imperialistic peculiarities of English capitalism. 16

## The British labour movement and imperialism

Thus, Labour imperialism brought workers of both factions of the working class  under  closer  control  of  capitalist  policies.  In  forming  this  alliance, those  in  the  labour  movement  who  fought  for  the  advance  of  socialism (with few exceptions) became converts who hammered out their own brand of  imperialist  labour  policy.  Both  the  MacDonald  Labour  governments between the wars, and the third Labour government's policies demonstrated this.

The  early  socialists, Keir  Hardie  and  Tom  Mann,  fought  against capitalist  policies  and  an  alliance  with  capitalists.  Both  men  had  travelled abroad and seen the effects of imperialism on the colonial working class. They, like Lenin and Stalin, had observed (under capitalism) the shift from old  Labour  reformism  to  Labour  imperialism.  In  effect,  this  meant  an 'open' alliance of Reformism with imperialism. Churchill's declaration that

the social services was dependent on overseas investment income received full  recognition  as  Labour  reformism  accepted  the  permanency  of  the 'income' as the basis for its social services, which they preferred to label the Welfare State.

To get a better understanding of Labour imperialism, let us take a brief look at official Labour policy in the Empire. In effect, the Labour leaders in government had become connected with the ruling class. Indeed, there was little  to  choose  between  the  arguments  of  Labour  imperialism  and  the Conservatives  on  the  colonial  question.  Whatever  charity  or  welfare  the Labour  government  would  dole  out  to  the  working  class  was  clearly calculated. Although the Labour Party had formed a government, they had not  seized  power.  In  effect,  they  had  become  the  protectors  of  the status quo ,  of British imperialist interests. Indeed, they did well to project a proworking class image.

Before  looking  at  the  main  themes  uttered  by  Labour  government ministers  and  official  Labour  Party  spokesmen  on  the  Empire,  let  us consider the general approach of the main sections of the Labour movement to imperial issues between 1899 and 1924.

During this period there were both objective changes taking place in the Labour movement and new and old influences which accompanied them. This was a time of rapid change within the Labour movement, from being industry-centred to being Parliament-centred. Whereas in 1899 the annual convention  of  the  movement  was  the  Trades  Union  Congress,  it  was emphatically the Labour Party Conference in 1924.

As a Parliamentary force, Labour was hard-pressed to play the role of a national  party.  This  meant  involvement  in  debates  on  the  major  issues  of economic  policy,  imperial  policy  and  labour  conditions.  Thus  began  the process of change from a party of protest to a party ready to participate in government. Moreover, this twenty-five year period saw the beginning of its involvement in the sphere of imperial policy.

Given this change in status, the Labour movement in Parliament meant that mere working class slogans could no longer be accepted as a substitute for  policy  in  Parliament.  The  Labour  movement  had  to  adjust  itself  to Parliamentary demands both for knowledge of the problems and the ability to  present  an  alternative  policy.  Overwhelmingly,  the  Labour  movement took the Parliamentary road to socialism. Thus constrained by the grip of

ruling  class  politics,  by  1924  they  were  still  casting  about  for  an  agreed method through which policy could be devised.

These objective changes in Labour's role and status in British society were  accompanied  by  old  and  new  influences.  Firstly,  when  the  'Little England radicalism' was put to the test before 1914 in the Boer War over South African  Union,  Labour  was  on  the  side  of  the  radicals  (within  the movement)  in  the  tone  of  their  arguments,  in  lobbying  and  voting.  The differences were in emphasis. 17

After 1914, the interaction between radicalism and the Labour movement  became  more  complicated.  The  clear  shift  of  the  Union  of Democratic Control, resulting  from  the  new  alignments  brought  about  by the war, was a rapid move to the left. By 1924, the UDC was absorbed by the  Labour  Party.  Radicalism  and  advanced  liberalism  after  1914  was  no longer just an influence on the Labour movement, but an integral part of it. This  reinforced  the  position  of  those  like  MacDonald  who  advocated  a reformed  Empire  and  Labour's  interest  in  imperial  problems.  The  new internationalism of 1918 afforded Labour a chance to argue that the world had changed, and that imperialism was a greater danger to world peace.

In  spite  of  the  diversity  of  views  within  the  Labour  movement  in general, it could be said that there was a minimum set of assumptions which all  Labour  men  could  have  applied  to  the  Empire.  Firstly,  the  Labour movement believed that the Empire should be reformed and not abandoned. This  immediately  put  Labour  into  the  category  of  a  bourgeois  reformist party; secondly, most Labour men, after 1914-18 believed that a reformed British  Empire  should  not  only  have  'Home  Rule  All  Round',  but  also economic  justice.  The  concept  of  trusteeship  for  native  races  in  the economic sphere was in line with the Labour movement's demand for social justice at home. This had been advocated by Hardie and MacDonald before the war. Indeed, Labour  and the New  Social  Order urged colonial development in the interests of the natives; and thirdly, with the exception of  South  Africa,  the  Labour  movement  adopted  a  position  of  'absentminded friendship' for the white settlers of the Empire. Australia, Canada and  New  Zealand  were  immigration  outlets  for  the  British  working  class who wished to 'escape' from economic depression and social oppression.

On the question of the Labour movement's attitude and policy towards the Empire  during  this  twenty-five  year  period, given  that 'Labour' describes  the  organisations  and  functions  of  a  group  of  people  and  not  a

doctrine,  Labour  parties  can  be  doctrinally  collectivist  like  the  British Labour  Party  after  1918,  or  individualist,  like  the  South  African  Labour Party.  When,  therefore,  we  look  for  something  'distinctively  labour'  in Labour's imperial policy, we can expect it to be doctrinally neutral. 18

According to one observer, 'this indeed is what we find'. Significantly (and paradoxically), British Labour  has  consistently backed, at least verbally, labour  movements  and  parties  in  the  Empire,  whether  they practised  racial  discrimination,  as  in  South  Africa,  or  civil  disobedience against Britain, as in India. This certainly is a distinctively 'labour' policy. During  this  period  there  was  very  little  criticism  of  the  Empire  from  the ranks of British Labour. As a corollary, British Labour opposed all attempts by governments or businessmen in the Empire to practise anti-trade union labour and strike-breaking. However, this doctrinal neutralism adapted itself poorly to Labour's status as a national party. Not surprisingly therefore, the distinctively 'socialist' element in Labour's imperial policy has been more lasting and has produced a more coherent set of attitudes.

After  1918,  the  socialism  professed  by  the  British  Labour  movement was  social  reformism:  in  other  words,  the  policy  of  greater  social  and economic  equality  through  redistributive  measures  aimed  at  the  wealthy, individuals or capitalist organisations. While the nature and timing of these measures was a matter for debate within the movement, the objectives were agreed.

On  the  basis  of  this  definition,  it  was  only  after  1918  that  Labour's policy  for  the  Empire  became  distinctively  non-socialist.  Before  this, Hardie's  views  on  India  were  readily  accepted.  But  few  Liberals  would have agreed to dispossess the white Kenyan settlers after 1918. Similarly they would have opposed Labour's policy of a rapid approach to manhood suffrage  in  India.  Such  policies,  aiming  at  rapid  and  fundamental  social change  and  attacking  the  possessors  of  wealth,  were  the  policies  of egalitarian socialism. But even so, post-1918 socialist policies were not so very different from radical policies. Indeed, the men who were advocating socialism in the Empire were ex-radicals disgusted with the Liberal Party. The Labour Party owed far more to British radicalism than to continental socialism. The Fabians, socialists with a strong tinge of British radicalism, reinforced the ex-Liberals in the conviction that the Empire should not be immediately  abandoned,  but  reformed.  Such  a  reformation,  they  argued, would  strengthen  rather  than  weaken  Britain.  In  this  traditionally  British

way the Labour Party reconciled equality with patriotism. It was an uneasy reconciliation,  open  to  attack  from  the  right  and  left,  but  it  is  only  by understanding this objective that we can begin to understand the hesitation and mistakes of Labour's policy after 1924.

One of the themes emphasised after the Second World War on the old Labour imperialist line was that the Empire was essential to the economic interests  of  British  workers.  Repeatedly,  contradictions  appeared  in  the speeches of Labour ministers, combining the philanthropic aims of Empire with the aims of economic exploitation. In this, the true relationship of the British  and  colonial  working  classes  are  revealed.  Justifying  this  Labour imperialism, one of the champions of the British Labour movement, Ernest Bevin  said  in  Parliament  on  21  February  1946:  'I  am  not  prepared  to sacrifice the British Empire [because] I know that if the British Empire fell … it  would  mean  that  the  standard  of  life  of  our  constituents  would  fall considerably.' 19 Thus, the exploitation of the British working class and the colonial  working  class  was  relative.  Indeed,  the  government's  Four  Year Economic Plan for 1949-53, submitted to the Marshall Plan organisation in December 1948, was aimed at achieving economic recovery and balancing Britain's trading deficit. In fact, they contemplated a large increase in the contribution  of  the  colonies  to  European  recovery. 20 That  same  year  Mr Bevin, as Foreign Secretary, told the National Union of Manufacturers on 14 October 1948: 'We have ceased to be an Imperialist race; we dominate nobody.' Yet he went on to state:

I believed and still believe that If  we  can  organise Western Europe with its direct connection with the Middle East, If we can use the great resources of our Colonial Empire in Africa, If  we  can  work  out  our  co-operation  with  our  great  Dominion  of South Africa, If we can arrange matters correctly with Pakistan and India, If we can maintain a correct position in South-East Asia, and

If  we  can  make  our  proper  contribution  to  the  revivification  of China, then with a little planning we somehow occupy the position of  a  general  balancing  factor  as  between  East  and  West,  and  may

provide  the  correct  equipoise  and  the  correct  equilibrium  for  the maintenance of peace and prosperity in the world. 21

This  fallacious  emphasis  on  peace  (and  prosperity,  for  whom?)  was contrary to the dynamic of imperialism which, in effect, means war! Thus, as the post-war Labour government moved to implement policies at home, to  appease working class tensions and demands through a British Welfare State,  abroad,  they  adopted  rapacious  plans  to  solve  Britain's  economic problems  by  assuming  a  'seven-fold'  increase  in  net  invisible  earnings between  1948/9  and  1952/3.  Of  course,  this  goal  was  to  be  achieved through  intensified  exploitation  of  the  working  classes  in  the  colonies.  It must  also  be  remembered  that  Britain  had  also  exploited  black  labour during  both  wars,  at  home  and  abroad.  Indeed,  the  year  before  Bevin delivered  his  'peace  and  prosperity'  speech,  there  were  racial  'riots'  in Liverpool, and a 'colour bar' had emerged as a 'problem' in Britain whether or not Bevin knew it.

Moreover, in 1948 the SS Empire Windrush had arrived in Britain with some  four  hundred  West  Indian  immigrants,  including  former  volunteer workers who had worked in British munitions factories during the war. This group  of  immigrants  added  to  the  earlier  black  settlements  of  Liverpool, Cardiff,  Hull  and  in  various  parts  of  London;  a  legacy  of  British  Labour imperialism.  It  is against  this background  that  we  must  look  at  the experience  of  black  workers  prior  to,  and  after  the  First  World  War, particularly in Cardiff and Liverpool.

## Cardiff: black seamen and soldiers

In  the  centuries  of  British  trade  with Asia, Africa, America  and  the  West Indies,  many  black  men  were  employed  on  British  ships.  Bristol  and Liverpool were two British ports where black seamen settled. By the turn of the century, the port of Cardiff had begun to join the ranks of British ports with a growing black community. In this maritime community, the Blacks in Cardiff inhabited the dockland  area, known  as  Bute  Town.  This population was highly concentrated in the neighbouring South Ward. On the whole, black people in Cardiff lived within the boundary of Bute Street and the Glamorgan Canal, and between Greek Church Street and Hodges Row.

Cardiff became a port of mercantile significance at the end of the First World  War  clearing  a  net  registered  tonnage  of  vessels  from  over  one million  in  1857  to  12.6  million  before  1914.  The  shipping  depression between the wars did not stop imports and exports which continued, albeit on a downward scale. Imports included iron ore, fruit, vegetables, pitwood and grain; and exports were coal, coke, patent fuel and flour. 22

In  addition  to  the  trading  activity  the  port  was  attractive  to  black seamen,  because  of  the  mildness  of  the  climate.  It  is  more  than  likely, however,  that  the  deciding  factor  was  the  employment  conditions  in  the shipping  industry.  Cardiff  offered  employment  to  both  white  and  black seamen. (Although tramp employment served a longer voyage than a liner, it  had  the  disadvantage  -  if  it  be  so  considered  -  of  no  job  permanence.) Liner  routes;  on  the  other  hand,  were  necessarily  less  casual  in  their demands.

Employment in the dock area for the black seaman was all-important, since  other  forms  of  employment  were  denied  him.  Historically,  the  first decade of  the  twentieth  century  is  important  for  the  black  community.  In 1911, Havelock Wilson led a national strike of seamen in order to form a national union. This strike was of major significance. The seamen demanded the right to industrial recognition and complained of low wages and deplorable working conditions. In his attack, Wilson and his colleagues in the union used the employment of foreign seamen on British ships as a major  grievance.  They  argued  that  employers  in  shipping  had  adopted  a policy  of  discrediting  white  seamen  abroad,  who  were  replaced  by  black seamen at lower wages. 23 Moreover, when the laid-off white British seamen returned home and signed-on, they had to accept the lower going rate for the job.

The unions had good reason for complaint. For one thing, labour in the shipping  industry  was  dependent  on  a  workforce  of  various  nationalities which was incapable of organisation. Captain Edward Tupper explained the difficulties:  'The  men  of  the  Tyne,  say,  had  in  many  respects  a  different sense of values from the men of the Mersey, or Southampton water. Even now  a  ship  owner  would  avoid  putting  a  mixed  crew  of  Liverpool  and Southampton on a big ship; a friction would set up. Just as a ship would not man with both Madras and Calcutta lascars.' 24

Indeed,  the  union's  objective  was  to  organise  all  seamen  serving  on British  ships.  In  this  it  was  successful.  Employment  on  British  ships between 1890 and 1903 of foreign seamen had been increased from 27,000 to 40,000 while the number of British seamen had decreased by 10,000. By 1912,  the  situation  had  changed  with  an  increase  of  about  30,000  British seamen and a reduction of 9000 foreign seamen. The decline in the casual employment of foreigners on British ships was even more drastic, falling from 40,000 in 1902 to 8000 in 1935. 25

During the First World War, the unions ensured that an alien employed on  a  British  ship  must  be  paid  at  the  going  British  rates.  This  ruling continued under the National Maritime Board. It applied however only to seamen  engaged  at  home  ports  or  on  European  articles.  There  were exceptions  to  this  rule.  Black  seamen,  for  example,  sailing  on  the  West African  liner  trade  from  Liverpool  could  be  engaged  at  lower  rates  than white seamen. The NMB acted as the Trades Council of the industry since its function was to negotiate with the employers. 26 It did not deal with ships which  sign  on  their  crews  at  a  non-British  port.  Consequently,  in Asiatic and Lascar articles there was a wide gap for wage manipulation. Later, this was to have extremely adverse effects on the black community in Cardiff.

Moreover,  merchant  seamen  employment  at  the  beginning  of  the century,  according  to  Tupper,  was  a  system  of  'slavery  and  starvation'. Wages,  he  argued,  'were  from  £2.15 .  to  £3.15 s s .  a  month;  £1.7 s .6 d .  to £1.10 . a week …; it was generally inadequate, often enough disgusting.' 27 s The  system  constituted  low  wages,  debt,  occasional  drunkenness,  fraud, graft and unemployment. In short, the full catastrophe of depression. Times were particularly hard for the black seaman  who  sought continued employment in a depressed industry in which there was little public interest during the inter-war period. The world economic slump had brought misery to  Tiger  Bay  and  elsewhere.  Blacks  in  Cardiff,  the  victims  of  social  and economic circumstances in which they lived and worked, were caught in a vicious circle of racial prejudice and discrimination in employment.

During the 1890s black people had settled in small numbers in Loudon Square. During 1914-18, the black community increased through waves of immigration. The demands of war brought to Britain those who in normal circumstances would have been repatriated by the government to 'their own country'.  The  abnormality  of  war-time  conditions  then  legitimised  their

entry and stay. During the war 200 men from black troops in Mesopotamia were transferred by the government to work in the merchant navy. A smaller number of black seamen arrived in England after 1914 as internees  from Germany. 28   British  ships  employing  black  seamen  operating  on  the  West African  and  other  routes were  'requisitioned by  the government  for transport service and their crews left behind'. Blacks went  also to Manchester and other cities to work in the munition and chemical factories, and in the ports of Liverpool and London, a similar situation obtained. As a consequence, large numbers of Blacks were domiciled in Britain.

With the closure of the war industries and other forms of employment, many black workers went to Cardiff where they were employed as seamen. The  laying-up  of  ships  in  Cardiff  contributed  to  the  increased  number  of West Africans and West Indians. Taken together, this influx of more Blacks had changed the character of the district to the extent that Loudon Square and the street surrounding it came to be known as the 'coloured quarter' of the city. Confined to this space, living accommodation for Blacks was poor and overcrowded. By the end of the First World War, single dwelling houses became  apartment  houses  with  two  or  three  persons  living  in  the  space hitherto occupied by one. During the war, and up to 1919, there was 'good money' to be earned as seamen. Through hard work and thrift, some black men prospered. Demobilisation resulted in large numbers of Navy seamen returning to their pre-war trade in the depressed shipping industry.

Given job scarcity, ship-owners and ship-masters took the provocative line of adopting  the  principle  of  'our  own  people  first'.  In  fact,  in September 1919, the Trades Union Congress passed a resolution condemning Asiatic  labour;  preference  to  be  given  first  to  British  white, then  British  black  labour. 29 This  divisive  action  caused  hostility  between Blacks and Whites. The British strategy of 'divide and rule' so successfully practised  overseas  was  now  being  implemented  to  separate  'colonised' Blacks from the rest of the British population. Consequently, 1200 unemployed Blacks faced severe economic hardship. They received unemployment pay of 29 . per week which contrasted sharply to earnings s of £15 per month during the war. 30 The prosperity which a few of the black seamen enjoyed provoked great resentment among white seamen who, on returning home to Cardiff, earned less for seamen's work than the better-off black man. This discrepancy, plus the fact that the soldiers were themselves

unable to find employment, contributed to rising tension between white and black  seamen  in  the  area.  Given  these  factors  and  undercurrents,  serious racial  riots  broke  out  in  Cardiff  in  June  1919,  with  wide  repercussions. There were disturbances in almost every port area of Britain where Blacks had settled or resided.

## The 1919 racial riots and after

Prior to the Cardiff riots there were disturbances in Liverpool and Newport in  February  and  March.  Earlier  in  1911,  there  were  race  riots  in  Cardiff involving  the  Chinese  community. 31 The  Cardiff  riots  of  1919  had  a profound  effect  on  the  black  community  for  whom  these  were  bitter experiences.

The trouble started on 10 June 1919 with a scuffle involving some white and black men. In the commotion a gun was fired. Soon a crowd of about 2000 people had gathered. A second shot was fired and several fights broke out (at the town end of Canal Parade) along Bute Street and its side streets. More gunshots followed. The mob was angry; they were out to get black men.  They  attacked  shops  in  Bute  Street,  completely  demolishing  one  where black men lived. 32

In  the  same  street  two  other  houses  were  badly  damaged  while  fire broke out in a black-owned boarding house. After an hour of violence and destruction,  the  fire  brigade  intervened.  In  the  aftermath,  one  person  was killed, while 14 others were injured. There was more savagery to come.

With time to plan, a better-organised attack was mounted on the evening of  11  June.  This  assault,  described  as  the  'Sidney  Street  Affair',  started early in the evening when a large crowd assembled near the Hayes Bridge. They proceeded to attack a house in Millicent Street where eight black men lived. Gunshots were fired at these men from nearby warehouses. Leading the charge were two uniformed soldiers. Confronted by 'armed' black men, they retreated and regrouped before advancing with a table for protection. In response to this attack, the besieged black men used razor blades and a revolver to defend themselves. While this battle raged in the house, a large crowd  which  had  gathered  outside,  ghoulishly,  'looked  on  admiringly'. Clearly, the racists had many supporters.

When the police and fire-brigade eventually intervened, they took the Blacks  into  protective  custody.  The  tension  and  excitement  generated  by these incidents showed no signs of abatement. For some days, outbreaks of

rioting  continued.  The  mob  were  confronted  with  a  large  police  presence and 'soldiers in full fighting order'. In spite of this show by the forces of law and order, the angry crowds pursued unlucky Blacks. Finally, the mob dispersed. Several black men who lived in Cardiff at this time said that for several  days  during  the  riots,  they  were  forced  to  remain  in  their  houses behind boarded windows and barred doors. 33

While  these  racist  attacks  on  the  black  community  might  have  been organised by a relatively small number of persons, there was no doubt that it  caused  the  maximum  physical  and  psychological  damage  to  the  black community. Black men were hunted and beaten by the mobs and yet one sociologist has suggested that 'Not one out of twenty members of the crowd could explain why the trouble arose.' This is particularly incredible when the chief comments heard were 'why should these coloured men be able to get work when it is refused to us?' Furthermore, sexual relations between black men and white women were also cited. 34 In  general,  the  mood  was kill  and/or  lynch  black  people.  The  bogey-man  was  always  black;  the scapegoat who was 'rooted out' and rushed upon by the mob.

In  counting  the  cost  (the  claims  for  damage,  mainly  to  property,  after the riots) the City of Cardiff Corporation paid out about £4000. But in terms of  damage done to race relations in the area, the effects of the riots were incalculable.

In  effect,  the  black  community  was  placed  in  a  precarious  position. Their  sense  of  oppression  was  compounded  by  the  fact  that  some  1500 Blacks were unemployed. With little or no income, in this maritime setting, they were caught, as it were, between destitution and the deep blue sea. In desperation, some applied to the government to be repatriated. Needless to say,  such  moves  by  Blacks  were  most  welcome  by  the  large  majority  of Whites  who  viewed  the  sensitive  question  of  racial  mixture  with  'an awakened conscience'.

While the idea of getting rid of Blacks was uppermost in the minds of the  townspeople,  there  were  serious  difficulties  in  the  way  of  effecting repatriation. For one thing, family ties among black people were particularly  strong  and  could  not  be  easily  disengaged  in  the  event  of separation. Then there were the strong protests of the keepers of boarding houses to whom  payments for rents already in arrears were not forthcoming. The black lodgers and tenants were in great debt. Since their

employment  ended  they  had  been  indebted  to  their  landlords  who  had virtually kept them since the Armistice. The real prospect of ejection by the boarding house keepers was not a welcome prospect for the Blacks or the local authorities. The situation was allowed to persist to this hopeless stage before  a  partial  settlement  was  revealed.  On  the  one  hand,  the  boarding house keepers were assisted by an official grant, while those Blacks who had not established an English domicile were repatriated. Thus, the black community, echoing a past experience, remained persecuted and depressed.

To a large extent, the misfortunes of the British shipping industry were reflected in the black communities  in  British  ports. Cardiff was  no exception during the period between 1921 and 1938. Foreign competition adversely  affected  British  shipping,  resulting  in  falling  profits  and  high unemployment. This economic depression brought human misery and social tension  between  black  and  white  seamen  who  competed  for  a  steadily diminishing number of jobs. But to compound the problem of unemployment,  the  shipping  industry  was  only  one  area  affected  by  a general  slump  in  world  trade.  As  it  was,  unemployment  among  seamen coincided with that of other occupations (particularly manual ones) which made industrial migration among seamen virtually impossible. For example, one possible outlet, the South Wales coalfields, in which a number of  black  men  had  previously  worked, was also suffering from an unusual state of inactivity.

Unemployment in the steam coal valleys was paralleled by depression in  Cardiff. 35 In  the  struggle  for  employment  in  these  circumstances,  the white majority possessed a clear advantage over the alien black minority. The black seaman's position in the port of Cardiff was worsened by the fact that 'The only course open to British shipowners remaining in the market was to keep down labour costs as low as possible, and coloured firemen and stokers,  provided  they  could  be  signed  on  abroad,  were  considerably cheaper than white seamen.' 36

Whether resident or domiciled in Britain, the black seaman was caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, he was not wanted by the shipowners and employers, while on the other, he was discriminated against by the white unions  who  viewed  him  conveniently  'not  as  a  section  of  the  same labouring class  striving  for  a  livelihood  on  exactly  the  same  basis  as  any other union member, but as the representative of an altogether different and

competitive  category,  which  directly  or  indirectly  was  responsible  for keeping  white  seamen  out  of  work,  and  forcing  down  their  standards  of living'. 37

This  was  the  union's  attitude  for  many  years  during  which  relations between white and black seamen became more embittered. The racial bias of the trade unions would become more starkly evident in later years with the growth of Britain's black working class.

There  were  political  repercussions  in  the  dispute.  The  struggle  by  the unions and their spokesmen was taken both inside and outside the House of Commons.  The  battle  which  began  in  February  1919  and  continued throughout the depression altered little from the original points. The basic argument took the form of a complaint from Neil Maclean MP to the effect that the British crew of the liner Malancha had been paid-off in favour of an Asiatic one. For example, in the old crew the British chief cook was paid £20 per month, the Asiatic one was taken on at £5 per month. This case, typical  of  many  others,  illustrated  one  of  the  gaps  left  by  the  National Maritime Board machinery.

The Labour or opposition representatives' role politically was to direct the  government's  attention  to  three  points.  Firstly,  the  number  of  alien workers  employed  in  the  industry;  secondly,  the  displacement  of  British seamen by black crews; and thirdly, to suggest various legislative measures of correction, through the employment of additional British seamen or by a rise in black seamen's wages. The government's response on these matters were firstly, that the amount of alien labour of the British Empire (though non-European)  was  very  small  indeed;  secondly  it  was  not  policy  to discriminate  between  British  subjects;  and  thirdly  that  as  an  industrial matter, it was best left for employers and unions to decide.

On  the  question  of  'British  subjects',  Dr  Burgin,  a  parliamentary secretary,  felt  that  a  large  percentage  of  black  men  were  British  subjects, and that it would be a long time before any attempt was made to examine British nationality and put it into grades and classifications. He added, 'It is no  good  talking  about  the  brotherhood  of  man  and  suggest  that  there  is some  difference  between  a  white  British  subject  and  a  coloured  British subject.' 38 To this, Mr Greenwood interjected, 'a difference in wages'.

In  their  attempts  to  discredit  black  labour,  the  pro-white  labour  lobby put forward additional reasons for the elimination of black labour such as

moral undesirability of its presence in Britain and its cost to the taxpayer. Given the dearth of statistics, government officials, in an effort to provide exact figures of the number of black seamen, laboured vainly. According to one source in 1919, there were about 5000 black seamen in Cardiff. It had already become clear that black labour had to be controlled, contained and disciplined,  if  not  removed  entirely  to  suit  the  changed  requirements  of British capital.

## Legislation and its application

It  is  within  the  context  of  the  many  complaints  and  popular  debates  that legislation  such  as  the Alien's  Order  of  1920  and  the  Special  Restriction (Coloured Alien Seamen) Order of 1925 should be seen. The SRCASO was, in  effect,  the  enforcement  of  the  earlier  Alien  Restriction  Act  of  1914, designed to keep aliens resident in Britain, under supervision. The object of the Aliens Order of 1920 was to restrict alien immigration, except in cases where they could support themselves and their families.

The main thrust of the Order lay in the power invested in the police to arrest  aliens  without  warrant,  and  to  close  certain  clubs  and  restaurants. Moreover, the Act was to place on the Alien an obligation to register with the  police  and  obtain  a  registration  certificate  which  the  police  could demand to be shown. Separate articles provided also that every alien should be in possession of a passport furnished with a photograph and duly issued not more than five years before the date of arrival or some other document establishing his identity and nationality.

The Order of 1925 was essentially concerned with checking the flow of alien  seamen  into  Britain.  In  certain  cases  its  effects  were  more  farreaching.  In  short,  black  seamen  were  categorised  with  other  aliens,  thus forcing  their  registration  in  accordance  with  provisions  in  the  Order  of 1920.  The  crucial  feature  of  the  Order  of  1925  was  its  application  to  all black  seamen  in  Cardiff  obliging  them,  irrespective  of  nationality  and domicile, to register with the police. In effect, this meant that alien seamen who wanted to be domiciled in Britain had to both prove their nationality and carry around a registration card. Further, the real intention behind the Order  lay  in  the  fact  that  in  Cardiff  the  onus  was  on  all  non-white individuals  to  do  the  same.  This  meant  that  an  alien  who  had  been  in Cardiff before 1925, and in possession of a registration certificate from the police, was in fact better-off than the black British subject who could not

prove  his  identity  by  documentary  proof.  Indeed  a  number  of  the  men involved  came  from  districts  or  tribes  in  colonial  countries  where  few,  if any, could write, and where there was no system of registration. Inability to prove one's identity led to a passport being almost invariably refused by a prejudiced  examiner.  (And  who  could  be  certain  it  was  not  policy  that colour  prejudice  should  lurk  among  officials  in  the  immigration  and passport offices?) In such cases, the black person was categorised an alien and could only be granted a certificate if he could prove residence in Britain before the Order was issued. Given his status as an alien then, he was liable to deportation at any time. Ironically, in this position he was able to make a small  gain  over  the  passport  holder  in  terms  of  employment.  And  what precious little employment!

The  position  of  passport-holding  British  subjects  left  much  to  be desired.  For  if  such  a  passport  expired  during  a  voyage,  it  could  be withdrawn,  and  the  person  not  allowed  to  land  in  Britain.  His  employer would then have to bear the expense of transporting him back to his own country or any other that would accept him or her. As it was, a large number of alien black seamen in Cardiff had evidence of nationality such as British passports, birth certificates, army and naval discharges from the First World War. Yet  they  were  harrassed  by  the  police  who  zealously  tried  to  make them register. If a man refused to produce a passport on demand, he was threatened with arrest and imprisonment. One cannot discount the pervasive effects of personal prejudices in these circumstances.

If there was confusion among some officials, it was clear that much of what was said and interpreted to Blacks was designed to mislead. The West Indian section of the community was told quite simply that the Act did not affect  them  at  all  but  was  aimed  at  the Arabs.  Under  this  falsehood,  the trusting West Indians willingly registered. Others were led to believe that registration was  no  more  than  a  mere  formality  which  automatically affected every seaman. With little to argue against (given these assurances) Blacks were victimised. So convinced were they that their status as British subjects would not be affected by the procedure that the few who had, until then,  managed  to  escape  detection,  voluntarily  registered  as  aliens,  to  be sure they were on the side of the law. In extreme cases, not surprisingly, the police  pushed  black  seamen  to  compulsory  registration.  And  very  often under threats to with-hold payment of wages, black men were compelled to accept Aliens  Cards  at  the  end  of  a  voyage. According  to  a  report  of  an

inquiry carried out by the League of Coloured Peoples, in the majority of cases,  the  shipowners  adopted  the  policy  of  acting  in  concert  with  the police,  using  refusal  to  pay  a  black  seaman  until  he  produced  an Alien's Certificate of Repatriation. 39

In the witch hunt, black men in Cardiff had no means of asserting their British nationality. Ignoring the malpractices contributing to the injustices perpetrated on the black community, the Home Secretary played it safe. He supported various kinds of police actions by taking a legal line. In instances where  passports  were  out  of  date  (or  otherwise  invalid)  the  holder  was advised  to  register,  if  he  had  no  satisfactory  proof  of  his  identity  or nationality. The Home Secretary felt the marking of registration certificates with the word 'seaman' would be enough to distinguish holders from those persons possessing certificates issued under the ordinary provisions of the Aliens Order.

Thus, the alienated Blacks became a moral problem. More pressure was exerted against the black community in Cardiff. One of the main sources of this pressure came from the trade unions, who were supposedly defenders of the poor and oppressed working man and the wider economic and social context within which they operated. Indeed the unions were the mainspring of  the  legislative  measures  designed  to  contain  and  harass  the  black community.

The League of Coloured Peoples maintained that the decision to employ white labour exclusively in the shipping industry of Great Britain was not arrived  at  suddenly  or  with  undue  haste.  It  was  the  outcome  of  a  mature consideration of the trend of certain  events  intimately  connected  with  the shipping industry. Clearly, the plan of having these men registered as aliens was devised and put into operation by legislative measures enacted through the influence of the trade unions and other labour organisations. 40

Given a crippled shipping industry and consequent rising unemployment  which  by  1931-3  was  one  out  of  every  three  registered seamen  in Britain, there was  little sympathy  for the isolated black community. So far as local conditions at Newport, Cardiff, Penarth, Barry and Swansea were concerned, in 1930, 41.4 per cent of the insured seamen were  unemployed,  and  in  December  1937  (two  years  after  the  Shipping Assistance Act) there were still 32.3 per cent unemployed. 41

Economic decline found its scapegoat in the depression of  the  1930s, and  the  replacement  of  white  seamen  by  Lascars  over  tropical  routes, helped little.

Anger over practices favouring Blacks awakened righteous indignation on 'moral' problems arising from the presence of black men in the ports. The muckraking that ensued invoked many distortions and prejudices. The Home Secretary's attention was drawn to the alleged dependence of black children on the Public Assistance Committee, not only in Cardiff but also in Swansea and Liverpool. Almost as if Blacks who constituted the 'Aliens' group were synonymous with sedition, he was asked to close loopholes in regard  to  aliens  (communists  and  anarchist  leaders  from  Spain)  from entering  Britain. 42 Indeed  the  wider  implications  of  the  'problem'  was  a source of great concern for the local councils. The 'fairly general consensus of  opinion'  was  that  the  increasing  size  of  the  problem  was  the  result  of 'certain laxities in the regulations governing supervision and control of the licensed  houses  and  cafes  in  the  dock  area'.  The  Report  of  the  Special Watch  Committee  records  the  following  resolution:  'That  in  view  of  the grave social evils resulting from the presence in the ports of this country of large  communities  of  coloured  seamen,  HM  Government  be  urged  to promote legislation to deal with the matter …' 43

Similarly, a few months later at a joint conference of the British social Hygiene Council and the British Council for the Welfare of the Merchant Marine, it was decided to draw the attention of the government to the fact that  in  view  of  the  increase  in  the  number  of  half-caste  children  in  the seaport towns, and of the future difficulty of finding employment for sons and  daughters  of  black  seamen  who  visit  these  shores,  the  government should  immediately  take  steps  to  enquire  into  the  problem  in  order  to mitigate  the  evil.  Furthermore,  the  Chief  Constable  of  Cardiff  urged  the government  to  support  the  recommendations  of  a  report  of  the  Watch Committee which he was convinced would 'have the effect of abolishing the undesirable cafes which form the cloak for the conduct which gives rise to the greater problem  of the half-caste children. Nothing  short of legislative  action  will  deal  with  this  part  of  the  problem,  and  it  is  a responsibility which the Legislature will sooner or later have to face.' 44

In the storm of protest, however, it became evident that the dependence of black children on public assistance was not only the result of the poverty

of the households to which they belonged, but also to a general prejudice against  employing  them  'in  virtually  any  sphere  but  seafaring'. 45 Things had  changed  little  since  the  first  black  seamen  settled  in  Cardiff.  Their children were regarded as social outcasts. As the Cardiff Juvenile Employment Committee emphasised: 'It is a very sad commentary on the Christian spirit shown, and indicates that the colour Bar is still very strong in this country.' 46

The  setting-up  of  special  sub-committees  had  no  real  effect  on  the gloomy  prospects.  Although  there  was  an  increase  in  existing  social activities, finding work for the children of both sexes, more particularly the half-caste girls, remained a difficult problem. A more extensive inquiry into 'the  colour  problem  in  the  ports'  of  Britain  produced  evidence  to  support the  above  finding  on  employment.  In  Liverpool  also  the  prospects  of employment for black juveniles were poor. Having written to 119 firms in that city, an inquirer received no reply from 63, and negative replies from 45. 47 In  addition,  similar  letters  were  sent  to  employers  of  domestic servants,  with  the  result  that  very  few  women  were  willing  to  make  the experiment  of  engaging  coloured  girls.  In  contrast  to  this  situation,  the Juvenile Employment Officer stated that about 50 per cent of the white boys applying from this area were eventually placed and openings for white girls from  the  district  where  most  of  the  black  people  lived  were  'distinctly good'.

But  what  were  the  possibilities  of  shore  labour  for  adult  black  men? Nineteen 'appropriate' firms were circularised. Out of the 17 which replied, 13 did not employ any black men and had never done so; two had done so during  the  war,  but  had  replaced  them  with  white  labour  when  this  was available.  Only  two  employed  'Negroes'  and  these  had  only  eleven  black employees  between  them. 48   Predictably,  the  report  was  met  with  a  good deal of hostility from the black community.

A further source of pressure on the black community was the effect of the Shipping Act. Through the British Shipping (Assistance) Act of 1935, the government provided a compromise by which shipowners and seamen were to be subsidised at the taxpayer's expense. The purpose of the Act was to enable the tramp owner to meet foreign competition, and by limitation of shipping  to  raise  freight  rates.  The  shipowners  were  to  scrap  'surplus tonnage'  and  in  return  the  government  would  grant  them  a  number  of

subsidies, amounting in all to £2 million. Trouble began when two ships of the Tatham Shipping Line (which had previously employed all black crews of  Malays  on  deck  and  West  Indians  and Africans  below)  changed  their policy. They refused to employ men who could not identify themselves, in spite of the fact that a Board of Trade official was willing to grant passes to anyone brought to him by the captain who had a continuous discharge book. The trade unions' position in the circumstances was most interesting. The local union officials felt that shipowners had a right to sign on whom they wished. Previously the 'donkeyman', a West Indian, had always picked the crew. This time, he did the same and took them to Barry to sign on. The Shipping Federation Officer (representing the owners) asked each man for his birth certificate or passport and if unable to show these the men were not signed on. The ship was delayed for a day in order to get in touch with the  superintendent  of  the  company,  whose  reply  was  that  these  were owners' orders  and  must  be  carried  out.  In  the  meantime,  a  sister  ship  at Cardiff  which  had  signed  on  two  Malay  sailors  brought  them  ashore  two days  later  and  paid  them  off  with  a  month's  wages.  They  were  told  they could  not  sail  without  passports.  The  matter  was  solved  that  afternoon, however, when the Company signed-on a black crew without passports, and the ship sailed. 49

These industrial developments on the docks led to more political debate. In  the  House  of  Commons,  Mr  Greenwood  rejoiced  to  hear  that  alien seamen would not be given places on British ships. Another Labour MP, Mr West, mounted a strong attack on Chinese, Lascars and black seamen, as a whole. In the mounting tension at the port, union officials intervened. By opposing  the  employment  of  black  seamen,  a  serious  disturbance  at  the docks  was  averted.  The  ship  involved  was  the SS  Ethel  Radcliffe which through the intervention of the League of Coloured Peoples, the Chairman of the Tramp  Shipping  Administrative Committee  and  the Shipping Company, eventually sailed with black seamen on board. In the daily press, under the headline 'Cardiff Colour Bar Causes Riot', the incident was seen as having 'averted serious rioting' between black and white seamen. 50

The  black  seamen  were  alarmed  and  with  good  reason.  The  events which  followed  had  drastic  effects.  Many  hundreds  of  families  lost  their only means of livelihood. One gets an idea of the enormity of the problem from the fact that by 11 June 1936, from a total of 690 unemployed firemen on the Cardiff Docks Register, 599 were black men. In the face of common

difficulties, to a large extent, religious and other differences were superseded  by  a feeling of solidarity among  the  various  groups.  A community was formed representing Africans, West Indians, Arabs, Somalis and  Malays.  This  organisation,  called  the  Coloured  Seamen's  Union, delegated one of its representatives, H. O. O'Connell to seek assistance for their cause in London. The assistance received was that of an inquiry into the vexed question of naturalisation. O'Connell also received the help of the League  of  Coloured  Peoples  and  members  of  the  House  of  Commons. Commenting  on  the  government's  rearmament  proposals  in  1935,  Mr Maxton pointed out that in the case of the black seamen, their rights and liberties  as  subjects  of  the  British  Empire  had  been  usurped  rather  than defended.

The inquiry studied 35 extreme cases in an attempt to prove misapplication of the Special Restriction Order. Of the 12 cases brought to the attention of the Secretary, seven men had their national status restored. At the time, the Order forced some 1500 men to carry the Aliens Card with them. In the subsequent readjustment between 1935 and 1937 approximately 1600 names were removed from the 'Live Register' (a term used  to  indicate  the  active  register  which  contained  the  names  of  black seamen  either  at  sea  or  ashore,  at  the  time  it  was  taken).  Of  these,  the majority had their national status restored to them. 51

## The role of the white unions

The trade union rhetoric of the 'brotherhood of man' had little bearing on the situation. Indeed, the role of the white unions was invidious as the black seamen  were  attacked  from  all quarters. The  Aliens' Order  and  its consequences  had  the  support  of  the  trade  unions.  Yet,  in  the  serious conflict of interests which arose the National Union of Seamen argued that far from wishing to dispose of the British-born black men (or at any rate the West  Indians  and  Africans)  they  were  actually  fighting  their  battles.  In support  of  this  argument,  they  cited  their  recommendation  drawn  up  in conjunction with the Transport and General Workers' Union (prepared for the  Trades  Union  Parliamentary  Committee)  on  the  question  of  shipping subsidies  and  the  conditions  of  seamen  against  domiciled  British  crews. This joint trade union memorandum stated:

No  government  assistance  of  any  kind  should  be  given  to  those shipowners  who  are  now  making  a  practice  of  employing  alien crews for their vessels, to the exclusion of domiciled British crews. It  should  therefore  be  a  condition  of  any  subsidy  or  other  form  of assistance that the crews of the vessels concerned should be entirely manned by domiciled British seamen.

If indeed, the word 'British' conveyed to the ordinary working man in Britain  only  white  citizens  of  the  British  Empire,  then  it  was  possible  to blame  this  interpretation  for  the  misunderstanding.  But,  if  this  was  a genuine  misunderstanding  the  union's  own  report  helped  to  foster  it.  The Seaman , the official journal of the National Union of Seamen, admitted that union officials and other white members of labour organisations had made too much of the employment of aliens. 52

Racial prejudice was the determining factor at the Cardiff Docks. For regardless of the views of the problem taken at union headquarters, a few of the local officials exploited to the full the opportunity to encourage black repatriation. They aroused public animosity by citing the argument of the black  community's  expense  to  the  public  rates.  In  this  connection,  the Western Mail and South Wales Echo reported that George Reed, secretary of the  local  branch  of  the  NUS,  said  thousands  of  imported  black  men  had unrestricted  entry  into  Cardiff.  He  had  no  doubt  that  if  these  men  were going to be displaced they should be repatriated.

## The black community: struggle for survival

Clearly,  the  depressed  community,  precariously  placed  on  the  Cardiff Docks,  was  being  pushed  further  to  the  edge.  As  the  Second  Industrial Report pointed out, the community had undergone severe hardship. In fact, the  history  of  Blacks  in  Cardiff  hitherto,  was  essentially  one  of  hardship. The  League  of  Coloured  Peoples  estimated  that  about  80  per  cent  of  the men had been on unemployment benefit during most of the year from April 1934 to April 1935. More strikingly, their home life had reached the level of bare subsistence.

While  social  development  and  cultural  advancement  were  almost  nil, even  church  attendance  was  denied  one  family,  whose  black  father  and brown  children  were  not  welcome.  Moreover,  secondary  education  and industrial employment were practically closed to them, essentially because

the sentiment of the city was to reject and restrict the 'half-castes'. In fact, a Cardiff public official was accused of calling for legislation to 'put a stop to the breeding of such children'.

In  effect  the  1935-6  trouble  aggravated  an  already  chronic  condition within the black community. How did black people manage to live? Seen in perspective, a large number  of  men  were  continuously  unemployed. Inevitably, their unemployment benefit, quickly spent, forced them to rely on the  Relieving  Officer  for  support.  In  1930,  relief  of  5 s per  person  per week was granted to about 250 Arabs and 300 Somali seamen and firemen, whose destitution during the shipping depression had brought their boarding house keepers to the end of their resources. The payments were made direct to the  boarding  house  masters,  to  cover  the  bare  cost  of  food.  The proprietors  were  willing  to  continue  to  provide  lodgings.  In  fact,  they approached the Public Assistance Committee and undertook to remove the Arab  seamen  from  chargeability,  if  the  Committee  would  take  no  further action to deport them. The Committee agreed and the relief was discontinued.

The impoverished position of the black community during this period was to  some  extent  reflected  in  these  out-relief  payments.  On  the  pretext that Blacks were accustomed to a lower standard of living than their white workmates in the trade, the grants were adjusted accordingly. Indeed, the same practice was adopted when the Unemployment Assistance Board was set up. This meant that instead of the basic allowance of 15 . per week for a s man living alone, a payment of 12 . per week was made to those judged to s be  living  'communally',  for  example,  those  sharing  a  'communal  pot'. 53 Differentiation  had  its  special  difficulties,  and  not  surprisingly,  became  a source  of  dissatisfaction  among  members  of  the  black  community.  They particularly  resented  the  implication  that  because  a  black  man  necessarily had to live more cheaply his needs were less great. It was pointed out that the benefit was barely sufficient.

Moreover, it was argued that in practice, a differential scale was adopted not  only  between  white  and  black,  but  also  between  the  various  black nationalities themselves. This was designed to set Blacks against each other and, of course, it was possible that differently scaled payments were made according to the circumstances of the case, but there was no evidence which indicated that the principle of adjustment  was  extended  in  the  way suggested.  Thus,  it  was  regarded  as  an  illustration  of  the  working  of  the

'racial myth'. Nevertheless, the policy of adjustment was approved by the Minister of Health. Justifying their relief programme, the Cardiff authorities claimed  that  'their  treatment  was  more  generous  than  that  of  most  other ports'. In fact, a large number of seaports refused to grant outdoor relief at all, and offered only institutional relief. Ravaged by poverty, many fought for  their  self-respect  and  dignity.  In  South  Shields,  for  example,  it  was claimed  that  after  a  few  days  in  the  Institution,  the  seamen  took  their discharge and did not seek further assistance there.

In  the  wake  of  the  'riots'  and  the  shipping  depression  then,  the  black community had become a 'problem', paradoxically arousing 'censure' and the 'curiosity of social investigations'. The weight of opinion was against Blacks. Social investigators and the media were uninhibited in displaying their  prejudices.  Black/white sexual relations and half-caste children were haunting  themes.  Immorality,  they  agreed,  was  endemic  in  the  black community. Richardson's report, for example, quoted in the Western Mail and the South Wales News , alerted the people of Cardiff:

Morality and cleanliness are as much matters of geography as they are dependent on circumstances. The coloured men who have come to  dwell  in  our  cities  are  being  made  to  adopt  a  standard  of civilisation  they  cannot  be  expected  to  understand.  They  are  not imbued  with  moral  codes  similar  to  our  own,  and  they  have  not assimilated our conventions of life. They come into intimate contact with white women, principally those who unfortunately are of loose moral  character  with  the  result  that  a  half-caste  population  is brought into the world. 54

Furthermore, he emphasised hybridisation and disease which helped matters little in a city which had openly showed its hatred for its alien guests. And according to the Western Mail , 'The problem of the coloured population in our seaport towns … demands immediate government action.' For not only the  social  amenities  of  the  white  man's  country,  but  the  best  interest  of black  people  themselves  were  at  issue.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  'many  of them are citizens  of  the  British  Empire;  many  did  fine  work  in  the  war', there was  no  room  for 'sentimentality' in the matter. For although 'Repatriation may involve hardships, and it is our obligation to make it easy for them to return to their homelands, where we will continue to carry the

'White man's burden'? The newspaper concluded emphatically, 'We can no longer tolerate that burden on our doorstep.' 55

This  attack  and  government  apathy  (although  a  few  white  residents wrote letters describing the report as misleading) led to a 'mild revulsion' in popular attitudes towards black people. The black community was not quick to  react  violently,  but  remained  spirited.  Visitors  to  the  community  found that black people were 'patient and peaceful in the face of their difficulties'. A Daily Express journalist on a tour of British cities commented on the lack of opportunity and the degree of colour prejudice in Cardiff. 56 In  spite  of the obvious problems confronting them, there was little public sympathy for black people in the distressed area.

Yet, given the experience of unemployment in their country of origin, and  in  spite  of  the  onslaught  against  them,  many  black  people  in  Cardiff still had an unshakeable belief in their rights as British nationals. Repatriation for the majority was impracticable. Indeed, some of the older men had 'grown into the place', having settled in Cardiff for 30 and in some cases  for  40  years.  Their  'determination  to  persist  was  generally  evident, and  the  sentiment  of  local  association  seems  to  be  amongst  the  strongest psychological characteristics which the younger generation have acquired'. 57

In sum this was the background of the black experience in Cardiff until the  Second World War. In historical  perspective,  the  experience  had  been shared (to a greater or lesser degree) by other black communities in Britain. Significantly,  in  economic  terms,  in  some  ways,  it  had  similarities  with white  workers  of  the  same  occupational  class. The  colour  bar  has  been  a general  feature  of  the  larger  ports. And  more  often  than  not,  Blacks  had been pushed and confined in the slums of the towns, as a direct result of the policies  and  practices  of  the  British  government,  and  the  racism  of  the employers and the trade unions. In Liverpool, as in London, there were race riots at the end of the First World War. Discrimination against black seamen had become widespread. What characterised Cardiff from other ports was that concentration of black families in one small area of the town resulted in 'the  creation  of  a  special  focus  of  prejudice,  broken  up  only  by  rather sporadic attempts at amelioration'.

If  peace  had  brought  unemployment,  poverty,  prejudice,  violence  and desperation to the black community, the prospects of the Second World War

offered the hope that at least things could not get much worse. Hitler could not be as menacing as the race-hate that Blacks were faced with in Cardiff.

## Liverpool: 'negro' workers and race relations

The  old  slave  port  of  Liverpool  has  had  a  continuous  black  presence; stretching  from  the  period  of  slavery  into  the  twentieth  century.  Between the World Wars, there was a small black population in Liverpool. This black presence  had  conditioned  the  attitude  of  white  people  in  the  city  who responded accordingly to the new arrivals. Liverpool had grown enormously  as  a  result  of  migration  from  other  ports  in  England,  from Wales, Ireland and from overseas. In spite of a diverse racial mix, the city had  acquired  a  distinctive  Merseyside  character  and  mode  of  speech. During  the  period  1941-51,  however,  there  had  been  clearly  marked  ingroup/  out-group  divisions.  Nationality  and  religion  divided  people  in Liverpool.  The  Irish  and  Welsh,  for  example,  displayed  a  high  degree  of national  consciousness.  In  fact,  there  had  been  outbreaks  of  antagonisms between such groups as Protestants and Catholics, and outbreaks of feelings of anti-semitism.

Given this complexity of inter-group relations in Liverpool, the arrival of  increasing  numbers  of  black  immigrants  to  join  the  indigenous  black settlement after 1918 added a new dimension. While the number of black people  was  not  large,  they  were  nonetheless,  highly  visible,  even  though one  estimate  before  the  Second  World  War  put  the  Chinese  and  'Negro' populations at just over one in a thousand of the total population. 58 In time, 'African'  immigrants  came  to  be  regarded  with  suspicion  and  hostility, particularly after being discharged from the armed forces and the Merchant Navy in  1919. Antagonism  between  Blacks  and  Whites  grew. And,  as  in Cardiff  about  this  time,  serious  disturbances  broke  out.  In  the  aftermath, public opinion was in favour of the repatriation of Blacks to the colonies. In fact, many (in the face of impoverishment and racial discrimination) were persuaded to return to their homelands. Others, however, adamant in spite of hardship, demanded their rights as British subjects to live in Britain. In spite  of  the  Blacks'  minority  status  in  Liverpool,  they  were  nevertheless seen as a threat by the white population, particularly in terms of competition for  employment.  This  threat  led  to  stereotyped  opinions  of  black  people. Not surprisingly,  then,  attempts  were  made  to  prevent  the  further  flow  of

'Negro'  immigrants  into  Liverpool  and  to  discourage  the  employment  of black  labour  on  British  ships. 59 Fortunately  for  racist  decision-makers,  it seemed essential economic factors were significant in preventing this policy from being implemented.

Nonetheless, 'Negroes' faced prejudice daily. With  these massive disadvantages,  the  'Negro's  difficulties  were  compounded  by  the  high unemployment  in  Liverpool  between  the  wars.  Unemployment  made  the absorption  process  of  the  newcomers  a  very  difficult  one  given  the economic insecurity on Merseyside.

Historically, Merseyside is characterised by its dependence upon overseas  trade.  The  predominant  industries  contributing  to  its  prosperity have been those connected with shipping, shipbuilding and transport. In the wake of the First World War, the area suffered from the severe effects of the depressions of the 1920s and 1930s. The casual labour system on the docks aggravated  local  unemployment  which  figured  among  the  largest  in  the country. The social tensions generated led to unrest. 60 The understandable widespread feelings of insecurity aroused by the unemployment  on Merseyside during the 1930s were related to the severe competition for a limited  number of jobs.  Nevertheless,  by  the  1930s  the  black  worker  had advanced marginally in that West Indians had become employed in English factories  doing  skilled  work  on  a  par  with  English  workers  in  a  working relationship  that  would  have  been  unthinkable  in  the  pre-war  period. Nonetheless, black workers were usually the last hired and the first fired.

The onset of the war, however, brought a change in their position. The existing unemployment was quickly eliminated in Merseyside, and in other areas of the country. The 'enemy' brought work for black seamen who were urgently required to man the Atlantic convoys, as workers for the Merchant Navy. Although  they  received  the  same  rates  of  pay,  black  workers  were still restricted to certain ranks in the merchant service.

Industry was also affected as workers of all grades, regardless of colour, were in demand. The war demand for munitions led not only to the building of  many  factories  (concentrating  on  war  production)  but  also  to  a  great demand  for  skilled  workers.  It  was  this  emergency  development  which influenced the Ministry of Labour  to direct skilled labour into the Merseyside area. Some of these workers were refugees from Europe, others were  the  West  Indian  volunteers.  Once  again,  in  wartime,  the  British

authorities had devised a plan through which they could exploit their labour needs.

## The wartime immigration scheme for West Indian workers

Against the backdrop of war, West Indians came to Britain under a scheme organised jointly by the Ministry of Labour and the Colonial Office, with the  object  of  increasing  war  production. And  to  legitimise  it,  the  scheme was  regarded as making  a small contribution towards relieving the unemployment in the colonies. 61

In the West Indies, men and women ravaged by poverty were eager to offer  their services  almost  at  any  price,  to  help  the  mother  country, regardless  of  the  fact  that  black  soldiers  had  bitter  experiences  of  racial prejudice in the British forces during the First World War. Although there were  few  openings  in  the  armed  forces,  at  the  time,  it  was  felt  that  the colonies could be called upon to help in filling the urgent need for skilled workers in the factories. The presence of black workers in Merseyside, over a long period of time, led to a policy of employing most West Indians in this area.

In Liverpool, these volunteer workers were selected by the authorities in the West Indies and provided with a passage to England and the guarantee of  free  passage  home  again  at  the  end  of  the  war.  From  this  statement,  it seemed quite clear that if these black workers were lucky enough to be alive after the war, they would be favoured with the 'guarantee of a free passage home'.

They arrived in England in 11 separate contingents: five from Jamaica, the rest from British Honduras, the Bahamas, Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands. The first three contingents from Jamaica  were  technicians  who  had  training  and  experience  on  the  island. The men from the other contingent, despite their 'experience' in the West Indies,  were  relatively  unskilled  on  arrival,  and  were  sent  to  one  of  the Government Training Centres where they received basic training in certain aspects of engineering before being placed in the factories as semi-skilled workers.  It  was  not  long  before  all  the  men  were  either  skilled  or  semiskilled. At the outset of the scheme, it was recognised that special welfare provision had to be made for these workers. 62

The Ministry of Labour did in fact make special arrangements and the men were put under the charge of a Welfare Officer and his assistant. The

man appointed to take charge of the scheme as a whole had previously been involved  in  an  inquiry  in  1940  into  alleged  discrimination  against  black British subjects in this department. Faced with racial prejudice, the Ministry of Labour had set the pace in pointing the way to the employers by refusing to  allow  prejudice  to  influence  the  appointment  of  the  best  qualified  men for the job, regardless of their colour. Officially, there was a strong desire to make  the  scheme  work.  Naturally,  black  workers  turned  to  the  Welfare Officer for advice and assistance whenever any difficulty occurred particularly on matters of colour prejudice and discrimination. Overseeing the  Scheme  were  officials  from  the  International  Labour  Office  and  the Colonial Office who paid periodic 'visits of inspection'.

Among the West Indian technicians and trainees, diversity was the most outstanding characteristic. Their backgrounds reflected varying educational qualifications  and  skill.  However,  determination  among  them  was  not lacking.  They  were  employed  primarily  under  six  headings:  engineering (skilled),  engineering  (semiskilled),  electrical  trades  (skilled),  electrical trades (semi-skilled), building, and civil engineering. Those who could not be so trained, were classified as clerical and miscellaneous grades.

## Discrimination in the employment of 'Negroes'

The  arrival  of  these  West  Indian  workers  must  be  seen  in  the  context  of discrimination against black people in British industry which was widespread before the Second World War. In spite of the fact that the state of full employment reached by 1940 had created an enormous demand for labour,  there  was  strong  resistance  to  the  employment  of  Blacks  among employers. Despite this resistance among several firms, demand for labour at that time far outweighed the supply. Consequently, in spite of prejudiced employers, black workers were able to find employment, primarily in the public sector. Indeed, in time, the mass of black workers were condemned to  these  low status jobs, essentially because black labour was regarded as cheap, disposable, and as such could not be unduly resisted.

Given  the  intransigence  of  employers,  some  form  of  labour  direction was  necessary.  In  Britain,  during  the  war,  the  Ministry  of  Labour  in directing  black  labour,  provided  one  measure  (the  Essential  Works  and Control of Engagements Orders) to be used if necessary against employers who discriminated against Blacks. Essentially, these Orders were introduced  to  deal  with  the  urgent  manpower  shortage  in  general  and,

according  to  one  observer,  'were  not  drafted  with  Negroes  or  any  other minority group in mind'. This may have been true, but difficult to believe particularly  in  view  of  the  fact  that  these  Orders  did  assist  Ministry  of Labour Officials in dealing with discriminating employers.

Armed with these powers for the duration of the war, West Indians were kept  fully  employed.  In  fact,  unemployment  and  discrimination  were  not serious problems between 1941 and 1945.

## Pay and conditions

In  the  employment of black workers in industry, the questions of rates of pay and working conditions were vital. Payment at less than the standard rates would have raised serious objections from the trade unions. The West Indian  technicians  and  trainees,  sensitive  to  the  demands  of  the  trade unions,  joined  the  following  unions:  the AEU,  UBISS,  ETU,  NUSMWB, ASW, NUPGDE, TGWU, and NUGMW. 63  As it was, no attempt was made to  undercut  wages.  Indeed,  it  was  the  cornerstone  of  the  official  Scheme that the black workers should receive no less than the standard rates paid to English workers. In fact,  this  was  agreed  by  the  men  before  they  left  the colonies. Subsequently, the disputes concerning wage rates were attributed to  'misunderstanding'  on  the  part  of  the  West  Indians  rather  than  any deviation from the principle of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.

Given the 'misunderstandings', wage rates remained a source of dispute from  the  outset,  and  throughout  the  operation  of  the  Scheme.  But,  what were these misunderstandings?  And why  the concern about wages? According  to  one  commentator,  the  reasons  were  firstly  that  the  West Indians, like the trade unions, did not wish to be used to undercut standard rates, and secondly, rates of pay were vital in determining satisfaction with working conditions. This was essentially the case when consideration was given to the question of a relative rather than absolute rates of pay. This was crucial  because  wages  were  closely  linked  with  status  in  industry.  This relationship,  underscored  by  the  desire  to  maintain  and  improve  status which  governed  much  of  the  behaviour  of  individuals  and  groups  in industry, was also a cause of much dissatisfaction and anxiety. 64

The outcome of 'hurried negotiations' established a special expatriation allowance of £1 per week per man which would be paid later directly into an account for them in the colony. This gesture was not enough. Bad feeling was aroused by the fact that the equivalent sum paid to an English worker

required to work 'away from home' was £1.4 .6 s d .  It  would  seem  that  the airing of these matters had a beneficial effect. In the months that followed, skilled West Indians were able to earn 'very large wage  packets', particularly  at  the  height  of  the  war  when  they  worked  many  hours  of overtime. Some technicians earned as much as £13 or £14 per week; others earned even more at the peak of the munitions drive. But these abnormal earnings were considerably reduced as the war neared its end. The disparity in earnings was a source of complaint. A more realistic standard of living without overtime was difficult to accept. One of the effects of the loss of overtime earnings was that the men who had saved large sums and made regular remittances to their families at home were unable to do so.

Furthermore,  wage  differentials  presented  a  severe  problem  among  a number  of  trainees  because  of  the  large  differentials  in  the  earnings  of different groups. The highest earnings in certain factories amounted to £10 per week or more for trainees, while for those denied the opportunities of bonuses and overtime, earnings amounted to no more than £5-6 per week. 65 The  arbitrary  allocation  of  the  men  meant  that  these  differences  did  not represent any distribution in merit or skill. Thus, the differentials justifiably aroused deep discontent.

One of the more serious effects of these arbitrary wage differentials was the way it affected morale in the hostels. These differences aggravated the other grievances West Indians had about life in the hostels and also in the way they were treated outside. One form of protest was refusal to pay the outstanding  debts  at  the  hostels.  Under  the  circumstances,  the  practice spread and became chronic.

In  a  foreign  land,  the  West  Indian  workers  (with  families  abroad)  felt alienated;  they  felt  no  sense  of  security  or  community  -  only  an  allpervasive sense of discrimination. However, one researcher has argued that 'The sense of discrimination under which some of the men laboured with regard to wage rates was completely unfounded, [and that] in no case was a West Indian paid less than the agreed trade union rate for the job.' But, he conceded that it was 'more difficult to assess the complaints with regard to aspects  of  working  conditions'. Allegations  from  black  workers  included the  tendency  to  be  selected  for  the  more  unpleasant  jobs,  the  lack  of promotion through seniority and merit, and the tendency to place men in a new shop to get it operative, but when the opportunity arose in their jobs to be upgraded to that of charge-hands or foremen, these men would be moved

to another new shop and the responsible posts would be filled by other men. Taken together, these complaints indicated that the West Indians (whatever the merits of the Scheme) did not always identify with the practices in the factories  where  they  worked,  and,  as  Richmond  admits  'did  sometimes labour under a sense of discrimination and deprivation'.

Before  the  end  of  the  Scheme  in  1946  many  changes  in  employment (the result of trial and error) were introduced. There was greater flexibility between contingents and among different firms. By the end of the Scheme some of the employers had employed one or more West Indians. While in some cases these changes suited individuals, more often than not they were in  accord  with  the  demands  of  the  labour  situation.  But  in  spite  of  the changes,  there  was  stability.  The  hard  facts  were  that  towards  the  end  of 1944,  some  55  out  of  77  technicians  originally  drafted  to  two  Royal Ordinance  Factories  were  still  working  there.  And  in  March  1951,  the remaining ROF (the others having been closed) had 12 of the original West Indian  contingent.  Clearly,  there  was  no  lack  of  commitment.  The  West Indians who arrived in 1941, when the factory was only just beginning to expand, had some of the longest service records in the factory. 66

## Post-war problems: redundancies and loss of earnings

The end of the war had a profound effect on the position of West Indian workers in Britain. They faced an uncertain future. In addition to the loss of overtime  earnings  and  bonus  payments,  redundancies  were  threatened  as white ex-servicemen returned to their homes. The prospects were very poor indeed. By November 1944 'an atmosphere of unsettlement was beginning to show itself amongst technicians and trainees, which was attributed to the termination of the war and repatriation'. 67 The increased war-time earnings meant  that  adjustment  to  basic  wages  created  difficulties,  particularly among those with family responsibilities, high rents and travelling expenses.  Most  of  the  men  knew  only  war-time  Britain  and  continued  to have high expectations. The Welfare Officer's repeated warnings failed to persuade the men to see the post-war situation realistically. Consequently, as their debts mounted, they blamed the authorities.

As expected early  in  1945,  redundancies  grew  and  jobs  for  the  semiskilled  West  Indian  became  a  serious  problem.  In  July,  there  was  further evidence  of  tension.  And  later  in  the  year,  the  WO  reported  that  the relaxation of the provisions of the Essential Works and Control

Engagements  Orders  made  it  difficult  to  get  employers  to  accept  West Indians,  when  vacancies  were  notified.  Relaxation  of  the  Orders  was controversial.  In  fact, the trade unions  had  pressed  strongly  for  this measure. They had accepted 'direction of labour' with the proviso that it be removed  as  soon  as  the  war  had  ended. 68 Moreover,  as  the  election approached, while the government felt it necessary to rescind these Orders, they subsequently reaffirmed them during the economic crisis of 1947.

It  was  clear  that  the  employment  of  black  workers  was  made  more difficult  during  this  period.  In  a  number  of  instances,  a  colour  bar  in employment  was  practised  early  in  1946.  In  the  aftermath  of  war  many employers were determined to keep black workers out.

Elsewhere, in the United States, for example, black workers were also beginning  to  lose  ground,  which  they  had  gained  during  the  war,  and discrimination  was  beginning  to  appear  on  a  larger  scale  again.  By  1946 then,  there  was  still  no  machinery  through  which  a  black  worker  could obtain redress as a victim of discrimination.

## Unemployment

From 1946, unemployment remained a central issue in Liverpool and the Northwest. Unemployment in Merseyside at the end of the war remained 'considerably above the average' for the country as a whole. The policy of setting up new industries in the area did not move at a pace fast enough to compensate for the decline in employment. This decline was stemmed when rearmament started again. Employment at the end of 1951 had reached the 'highest  in  the  post  war  period'.  A  special  count  in  January  1950  and February 1951 showed that there was some 'improvement in the employment  prospects'  of  black  colonials  in  Liverpool. 69 Although  there was  some  improvement  in  the  unemployment  among  semi-skilled  and skilled  West  Indians,  there  was  an  increase  in  unemployment  among  the unskilled.  Among  West  Indians  and  West  Africans,  unemployment  was about 17 per cent in January 1950. The figure in 1951 was approximately 12 per cent. By comparison, the figures for the total working population of Merseyside were 5 per cent declining to between 3 and 4 per cent in 1951. This was above the national average of approximately 1.5 per cent. 70

Discrimination

Overall, there was undeniable evidence that discrimination in employment against  'Negroes'  occurred,  although,  at  the  time,  it  was  not  possible  to quantify its extent and degree. Among the reasons given by employers for their refusal to employ Blacks were essentially a past unfortunate experience and fear of strikes by their present (white) workers as a result. The latter reason was a powerful determinant, for while there had been no instances officially recorded of an industrial dispute involving the employment of Blacks, there were instances of threatened strikes on these grounds.  Needless  to  say,  the  prejudiced  employer  found  this  useful. Unfortunately, it was argued that the irresponsible behaviour of a minority of Blacks tended to reinforce prejudices.

In  the  face  of  these  difficulties  in  employment,  it  was  not  surprising then to find a considerable number of West Indian technicians, trainees and unskilled  workers  leaving  Liverpool  for  other  towns,  particularly  in  the Midlands  and Southeast where  work  was  plentiful.  Accommodation, however, acted as a real deterrent to black workers on the move. Once one or two of them had established themselves in a new town, they searched for accommodation for their colleagues.

Unemployment in Manchester  after  the  war  was  not  as  serious  as  on Merseyside. In March 1949, there were 150 'Coloured Colonials' registered as  unemployed  at  the  Oldham  Street  Exchange.  Of  this  number,  only  26 were West Indian, and of these only seven appeared to have come to Britain under  the  original  Scheme.  The  others  were  discharged  ex-servicemen  or men who paid their way and arrived in Britain during 1948. In Manchester also  there  was  discrimination.  The  Employment  Exchange  confirmed  the unwillingness of employers to accept black workers because of the difficult behaviour of a few of them.

The closure of the colonial hostels at the end of the war resulted in the original  residents  moving  to  Liverpool,  Manchester  and  other  areas.  In Bolton, a new  group of West Indians emerged as private lodgers. Apparently  well-adjusted,  they  were  employed  in  the  cotton  industry  as motor mechanics, motor drivers and labourers. In spite of the fact that there had  been  no  disturbances  since  the  end  of  the  war  (and  given  the  Chief Constable's endorsement of the men's good behaviour) employers were still reluctant  to  employ  black  workers  on  any  large  scale.  This  attitude  was supported by the local trade union officials.

After 1946, the poor employment prospects of Blacks in the Northwestern areas led to a substantial migration to the Midland region. In Birmingham, a small black community amounting to 'a few hundreds' had grown. Here, in the post-war situation, the local authority took an interest in the  welfare  of  the  Blacks  and  set  up  an  Afro-Caribbean  Centre  which provided educational and recreational facilities.

In  the  pottery  districts,  some  Blacks  were  being  accepted  and  a  few found their way into the mining industry. It seemed, in these areas of full employment  and  labour  scarcity,  there  were  few  employment  problems. Accommodation,  however,  remained  a  serious  problem  and  acted  as  a strong deterrent to migration, particularly to those with families.

## West Indian workers, employers and managements

The  relations between  West  Indian  technicians  and  trainees and  the managements  of  the  various  firms  employing  them  varied  widely  from factory  to  factory.  The  personal  qualities  of  the  workers  and  the  attitudes and policies of managements were crucial determinants in these relationships.

For  both  the  government  and  private  employers,  black  labour  was worrisome, now that their colonial war contribution had been made. On the one  hand,  black  workers  had  certain  standards.  Many  of  them  were  very sensitive (by and large they were made to feel so) about work which was 'unpleasant or below their dignity'. They interpreted being given such work as  an  example  of  prejudice  and  discrimination  against  them.  They  also disliked 'outdoor work'. Their main grievance was that they were singled out for special treatment; a more equitable distribution of certain jobs would have  alleviated  the  problem.  Later,  this  discrimination  in  certain  kinds  of jobs,  against  black  workers,  would  become  a  continuing  theme  in  British industry.

On the other hand, those in management were prone to hold grudges. While there were many issues directly related to West Indian workers, there were  also  common  issues  affecting  both  black  and  white  workers.  For example, West Indians who interpreted disciplinary action or dismissals as based on colour prejudice also, in some cases, identified themselves closely with English workers against management if they felt strongly about some other  injustice.  Overall,  the  essential  effect  of  discrimination  practised  by

management against individual West Indians tended to engender strong ingroup solidarity among black workers. 71

Some incidents stirred deep feelings. On one occasion, white workers threatened to strike if the black workers were not suspended or punished in some way for their 'walk out'. Understandably, security of employment has always been a major preoccupation among West Indian workers in Britain. By 1951, in the last remaining government factory in Liverpool, nine out of twelve  West  Indians  were  established  civil  servants  who  enjoyed  the benefits of that status. As one worker put it: 'Establishment gives a man a feeling  of  security  and  you  get  certain  benefits  and  gratuities.  You  know that you will be the last to be sacked. On the other hand, it is a bit of a tie, because  you  cannot  leave  without  sacrificing  those  benefits  you  have accumulated and you have to be prepared to go anywhere or do any job the Ministry likes to send you on.' 72

In  some  factories  black  workers  were  compared  favourably  with  the members of other minority groups employed. One labour manager said, 'I would rather employ a coloured West Indian any day to an Irishman: they are much cleaner and more reliable altogether.' In justifying their prejudices, it seemed, employers resorted to exploiting any differences (real or imagined) between groups of workers.

## Relations between black and white workers and with the trade unions

The relations between the West Indians and white workers were dependent on conditions which varied from place to place, and upon the local situation at  the  time  and  the  personnel  concerned,  both  for West  Indians  and  other workers.  However,  three  main  stages  had  been  identified  in  the  relations between  employers  and  employed.  Firstly,  there  was  the  stage  of  initial surprise and shock to find a group of Blacks doing skilled work; secondly, there was the period when the West Indian group tended to be treated as a scapegoat for the things that went wrong in the factory and thirdly, a stage in which the West Indians gained acceptance as part of the natural order of things  (and  whilst  not  always  completely  integrated  into  the  life  of  the factory)  they  were,  at  any  rate,  tolerated  and  respected  as  individuals  on merit.  A  fourth  change  took  place  when  the  war  ended;  with  increasing redundancies, the West Indian worker tended to be rejected.

During  the  initial  stage  of  surprise  at  black  workmanship,  the  black stereotype as a person of primitive habits, little knowledge and completely uncivilised, was the norm. One West Indian was asked where he kept his tail! At  the  workplace,  there  was  astonishment  when  West  Indians  began work on the machines. One black worker recalled his first day: 'I remember the  first  day  I  started  at  the  factory.  I  was  put  on  a  machine  I  was  quite familiar with because we had used it a lot at home. I began work straight away, but before long I had a crowd of spectators around me all of them wide-eyed!' 73 The novelty did not last long. Soon there was animosity and a series of grievances. Among the West Indians there were excellent workers who received praise from management and in some cases, earned more than white workers. According to one worker this recognition inevitably aroused bad feelings. 74

West Indians had to be particularly careful in their relations with their white co-workers. The atmosphere was, more often than not, charged with tension.  There  was  considerable  ambivalence  in  the  attitudes  of  some whites  towards  the West  Indians. While  there  was  genuine  recognition  of skill, workmanship and other abilities, yet there was reluctance to give full credit. Indeed, the English worker could not accept the black worker as an equal;  he  was  bound,  gagged  and  tied  by  the  notion  of  the  black  man  as being inferior. A case in point was provided by a Jamaican technician who became a shop steward, and later, deputy convenor for the trade union in one factory. In this role he was called upon to represent white employees. When the Jamaican had succeeded in reversing a decision by management which involved a white employee, the employee concerned remarked: 'Well that  damn  nigger  certainly  spoke  up  well  for  me!' 75 Forthrightness  and honesty in West Indians was met with puzzlement and surprise.

Moreover, relations with the trade unions were revealing. Trade unionism, so integral a part of the industrial structure in Britain, was in its infancy  in  the  West  Indies  about  this  time.  Indeed,  the  West  India  Royal Commission of 1939, Major Orde Browne's and the Forster Commission Reports, 76 all emphasised trade union organisation in view of the deplorable labour conditions in the West Indies. Walter Citrine, General Secretary of the TUC (and a member of the Moyne Royal Commission) in spite of the difficulties, was the most insistent advocate of the formation of Trade Union Councils in the West Indies. 77

Given  this  background  then,  the  majority  of  West  Indians  coming  to Britain did not immediately see the significance of trade union membership and  its  value  to  them.  The  trade  unions  themselves  were  not  altogether welcoming. Their attitude was, take it as it is, or leave it. In fact, one union was  especially  slow  to  recognise  that  West  Indians  were  competent  and qualified for full membership. Further, a West Indian was removed from his employment in the shipyard because the shop steward had orders from the union  involved,  the  United  Society  of  Boiler  Makers  and  Iron  and  Steel Shipbuilders (UBISSS). Subsequently, a number of West Indians gained full membership  only  after  providing  credentials  from  their  employers  in Jamaica. Unfortunately, the situation affected some to such an extent that their experience of the union was difficult to eradicate.

The other two unions directly concerned, the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Electrical Trades Union, were much more welcoming. The Ministry  of  Labour  officials  received  the  co-operation  of  the  District Secretaries of these unions. Moreover, the West Indians themselves spoke highly of the way in which the unions tackled any sign of colour prejudice among their members. 'In the union I am a Brother', said one man, 'and there is no distinction of colour, class or creed.'

In  time,  a  number  of  West  Indians  became  actively  involved  in  the Amalgamated  Engineering  Union,  holding  several  offices  for  varying periods  of  time.  Significantly,  this  meant  acting  on  behalf  of  all  factory workers,  both  black  and  white.  Unfortunately,  these  black  trade  union activists were few; the majority of West Indians were apathetic and tended to  get  in  arrears  with  subscriptions. According  to  the  Ministry  of  Labour records  for  1944,  there  were  nine  unions  representing  the  West  Indian technicians. 78

## The end of the Scheme and after

At  the  end  of  the  war,  a  number  of  administrative  problems  arose  as  the Scheme  was  wound  up  and  many  of  the  workers  were  repatriated  to  the West Indies. One of the immediate effects as the Scheme was brought to an end in 1946 was that the West Indian technicians and trainees ceased to be a special group. In effect, they merged into the wider West Indian and black community in Britain, with all its attendant disabilities.

As early as 1944, a scheme of post-war training was envisaged. High expectations were not fulfilled. Indeed, the original proposals were

modified  and  the  final  version  of  the  Scheme  provided  for  'Further Education and Vocational Training'. In this context, further education meant education  beyond  secondary  school  (for  example  at  a  University  or  other establishment of higher education), undertaken on a part or full-time basis. On  the  other  hand,  vocational  training  was  intended  to  give  training essentially in technical work for those who were unable to undertake proper training.  The  precondition  for  receiving  either  an  education  or  vocational training grant was 'effective full-time service in work of national importance during the war'. On these grounds, the West Indian volunteers would qualify. Such training was also related to the benefit accruing to the worker on return to his colonial home. In fact, 'the colonial office wished to be satisfied that there would be employment available in the Colony.' But what  if  they  could  not  be  satisfied? Apart  from  these  crucial  background questions, a further stipulation made was that the West Indians 'must not be in debt to the hostel'. 79 As it was, this proved a troublesome issue.

To get the training plan off the ground, the West Indians received letters explaining the details, and applications were invited. At the outset, it was clear that most of the technicians would not qualify for grants, since they were already trained. Many  accepted repatriation. Others postponed repatriation by applying for training. The final tally showed that only about 12  men  who  were  under  the  Scheme  received  grants  provided  for  by  the Further Education and Vocational Training Scheme.

The percentage refusing repatriation was high for technicians, some 43 per cent. On the other hand, the number of trainees from British Honduras who accepted repatriation was also above average. 80 Those men who had arrived  earlier  were  more  anxious  to  return  home  than  those  who  arrived later.  On  their  return  home  to  the  colonies,  these  early  expatriates  found they had, in effect, jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. They found conditions in the West Indies very poor indeed, and urged their friends to remain  in  Britain.  Judging  from  the  experience  of  the  early  expatriates, repatriation had proved to be a bitter disappointment.

Yet,  by  the  end  of  1946  many  technicians  and  trainees  had  accepted repatriation. Those who refused repatriation were struck-off the Scheme and were  no  longer  qualified  for  an  expatriation  grant.  Further,  they  were  no longer  under  the  special  jurisdiction  of  the  Welfare  Officer.  By  October 1946, 94 men in the Merseyside area were still 'on the scheme', 32 of them

were unemployed. Morale among the men had deteriorated thereafter. 81  In discharging  them,  the  government  had  freed  itself  from  all  responsibility. Thus,  the  least  fit  to  survive  were  left  to  eke  out  an  existence  in  an economic system founded on the survival of the fittest.

## Conditions in the West Indies

Sir Frank Stockdale who said at the beginning of the Scheme that it would make  'a small contribution towards relieving unemployment  in the colonies', seemed  to  have  conveniently  forgotten  the  implications  of repatriation.  Unemployment  in  Liverpool  and  elsewhere  in  Britain  had alerted West Indians to the same problem in the West Indies.

All the official reports upon the social and economic conditions in the West  Indies  supported  the  men's  anxiety  over  employment  prospects  on their  return  there.  In  1943  and  1944,  Sir  Frank  Stockdale  reported  that unemployment problems had become more difficult to resolve year by year, particularly among town dwellers. The position in Jamaica had been quite acute for several years, and in Barbados there was a measure of underemployment at certain times of the year, while St Lucia usually had unemployment problems to face from time to time, especially in Castries and  elsewhere.  In  Belize,  British  Honduras,  there  were  unemployment problems. 82 Further, Sir John MacPherson confirmed the seriousness of the post-war  situation  in  his  report  for  1945  and  1946:  'Towards  the  end  of 1945 unemployment in Jamaica and Barbados threatened to become acute mainly  because  of  large-scale  repatriation  of  British  West  Indian  workers from employment in the United States of America and to a lesser degree the return of demobilised servicemen.' 83

The percentage of unemployment for Jamaica in 1943 was 25.6 per cent and was probably 'higher still' in the post-war years. According to the 1946 Census for the other colonies unemployment ranged from 2.5 per cent in British Guiana to nearly 10 per cent in St Lucia. In addition, all the colonies had a considerable measure of under-employment and seasonal unemployment.

Although it was not until the beginning of 1946 that the full details of the training scheme and the arrangements for repatriation were announced a few  technicians  and  trainees  were  repatriated  during  1945  on  health grounds or for unsatisfactory behaviour. Interestingly, those technicians and

trainees  who  readily  accepted  repatriation  did  not  hesitate  to  warn  their colleagues  still  in  Britain  of  the  poverty  at  home.  They  advised  that  they should prolong their stay in England.

Taken together,  the  facts  regarding  unemployment  in  the West  Indies, and the sentiments expressed in individual letters, showed that a resettlement of the men returning home posed a serious problem. In Britain the  authorities  provided  special  advice  and  assistance  in  adjusting  to civilian life and sought appropriate employment for the demobilised men. To  implement  this,  the  Ministry  of  Labour  set  up  a  Special  Resettlement Advice  Bureau.  Fortunately,  their  work  was  helped  by  full  employment conditions which existed in most parts of the country after the war. In fact, there  was  a  general  demand  for  labour.  This  contrasted  sharply  to  the depressed conditions in the West Indies. For one thing, there were few of the  official  arrangements  that  could  be  compared  with  the  Resettlement Advice Bureau service in Britain. Moreover, high unemployment compounded the difficulties in the way of returning colonial ex-servicemen and volunteer workers.

## The West Indians return to England

The  war  had  offered  opportunities  for  workers  from  the  West  Indies  to escape from unemployment, low wages and poverty to the relative security of  the  war  effort  in  England.  Repatriation  was  the  sad  realisation  of  the return to impoverishment. Adjustment in the colonies was a forlorn hope. Consequently, it was not long before West Indians, particularly Jamaicans, began to find their way back to Britain. By March 1947, the Welfare Officer stated: 'In the consequence of the conditions prevailing in the West Indies, several men previously repatriated by this department have returned to this country; and a few have already been in touch with this office with a view to being placed in employment.'

The arrival of the West Indians in peacetime Britain, not only exposed them to the difficulty of being placed in employment, but also of obtaining reinstatement  in their trade unions. Inevitably, disillusionment in the colonies led to a growing number of West Indians seeking employment in Britain during the post-war years. This number constituted those members of the Scheme who refused the offer of repatriation, and stayed in Britain. Among them were a few demobilised ex-servicemen, repatriated workers, ex-servicemen who decided to return to Britain once more, and finally there

was an influx of men and women who came after the war for the first time, essentially in search of work.

The majority of West Indians coming to Britain at this time, paid for a passage  on  a  ship.  This  flow  of  immigrants  reached  a  high-point  in  July 1948  when  approximately  400  West  Indians  disembarked  from  the SS Empire Windrush . Two hundred and two persons from this group found jobs immediately.  The  majority  of  them  were  skilled  or  semi-skilled  workers. The remaining 198 dispersed throughout the country, and to a few towns, Liverpool and Manchester in particular. In October 1948, 180 West Indians arrived in Liverpool on the SS Orbita including students and wives joining their husbands. Another 39 Jamaicans (including 15 women) arrived at the port in December 1948 on the SS Reine Del Pacifico . And in June 1949 the SS Georgie brought 253 West Indians, including 45 women. Thirty-four of the  men  in  this  party  were  unskilled,  but  the  remainder  were  skilled  or semi-skilled tradesmen in search of work. 84  The flow continued as several hundred West Indians arrived during 1950 and 1951. Given these waves of immigrants,  post-war  immigration  from  the West  Indies  was  estimated  to have reached as high as 1750 per annum. 85

The  inter-war and post-war years saw  an increase in the black population  in  Britain.  Constituting  a  small  but  important  minority,  as  a group, the Blacks were largely disorganised. Often they sought representation for their grievances from black organisations, few of which had  any  real credibility. The  middle  class  black intelligentsia, more concerned with the ideology of Pan Africanism, did not ignore the problems of racial discrimination against black workers. One organisation which did make an attempt at black working class representation during this crucial period was the League of Coloured Peoples.

## 5 The League of Coloured Peoples and Black Radical Groups

During  the  1920s  there  were  several  black  organisations  in  Britain.  The most  notable  were  the  African  Progress  Union  (which  later  had  close connections with the League of Coloured Peoples) led by John Alcindor of Trinidad, the West African Students' Union dominated by Ladipo Solanke, the  Union for  Students  of African  Descent,  and  the  Gold  Coast  Students' Association. 1

After the race riots in Cardiff in 1919, colour prejudice was to rear its ugly  head  time  and  again  in  that  port  as  in  Liverpool.  Discrimination against black seamen (as we have seen) was no secret; indeed it had almost become  a  way  of  life!  By  1925  feelings  against  black  workers  were  so strong that with the support of the National Union of Seamen, Blacks were denied  employment.  Given  the  battering  they  received,  black  workers mainly  in  the  dockland  areas  of  the  major  ports  were,  instead  of  being disorganised and demoralised, drawn together as a community. Beleaguered,  they  lacked  wider  support.  Racial  feeling  had  stirred  many,

and  not  least,  Dr  Harold  Moody,  a  Jamaican  doctor  who  founded  and became the first and only President of the League of Coloured Peoples. 2

Given that there were comparatively few black students in Britain at the time, Moody felt there was a great need for an organisation which would bring together not only students (as the West African Students' Union had done)  but  different  people  as  well  from  as  wide  a  range  as  possible. 3 According to Ras Makonnen (a radical Pan Africanist) the LCP group was an  extension  of  the  English  charitable  tradition,  inter-racial,  involved  in 'mild protest' and harassing the 'goody-goody' elements in Britain. 4

This  was  the  first  major  black  organisation  which  aimed  to  bring  the black races together. The League's original objects were:

To  promote  and  protect  the  Social,  Educational,  Economic  and Political interests of its members;

To interest members in the Welfare of Coloured Peoples in all parts of the world;

To improve relations between the races;

To co-operate and affiliate with organisations sympathetic to coloured people. 5

By the time of its Tenth Annual General Meeting, 'To render such financial assistance  to  coloured  people  in  distress  as  lies  within  its  capacity' 6 was added  to  the  list.  The  officers  were  Ansah  H.  Koi-Vice-President  (West Africa);  Stephen  Thomas  -  Secretary  (West Africa);  Miss  Una  Marson  Assistant  Secretary  (Jamaica);  David  Tucker  -  Publicity  Secretary  and Editor  (Bermuda);  K.  L.  Gordon  -  Treasurer  (Jamaica),  and  Miss  Stella Thomas (West Africa). 7  During the first two years, apart from Ms Marson and Ms Thomas, Christine Moody was also an officer of the League. Other women  involved  were  Mrs  Sylvia  Lowe,  Ms  Dorothy  Clarke,  Mrs Amy Barbour James and Ms Viola Thompson. By 1934-35, J. A. Barbour James (formerly of the African Progress Union) and K. A. Chunchie from Ceylon, were Vice-Presidents. C. L. R. James, Louis Mbanefo, Arthur Lewis, Learie Constantine and Peter Blackman, 8  among others, were also associated with the LCP.

This  nucleus  of  well-educated  black  people  was  confronted  with  the difficulties in bringing together disparate groups of black people in Britain.

In an effort to do this, the League issued a quarterly magazine, The Keys , which  was  sold  at  2/6  per  copy.  The  LCP's  essentially  middle-class leadership assumed that this literature would inform and mobilise the black population in the dockland areas. Through this organ, the League consistently appealed for funds. Financial troubles, more than anything, at least  initially,  hampered  it  from  being  a  more  vigorous  organisation.  The LCP's officers nevertheless gave willingly of their free time since initially there  was  no  prospect  of  employing  paid  officers. Their  commitment  and expertise  guided  their  readers,  pointing  to  cases  of  colour-prejudice  and discrimination wherever they existed. The League focused its attention on Cardiff's  (as  well  as  that  of  Liverpool,  London,  Newcastle,  Hull  and Glasgow) black population, highlighting some of the glaring inequities of the black communities.

What was beyond question was the fact that the colour bar in Britain was  all-pervasive,  reaching  every  level  of  British  society.  Those  who suffered  from  it  individually  had  no  recourse  but  to  seek  solidarity  on common issues. Organisations within the black population in Britain were few. Apart from the Coloured Colonial Seamen's Union, formed in Cardiff in 1935, the LCP was the only organisation able to bring any degree of coordination  to  the  black  worker's  experience  in  Britain  and  elsewhere. Indeed, the CCSU sought the help and advice of the League, the Executive Committee of which unhesitatingly voted the necessary money to enable an investigation  to  be  made  on  the  spot.  In  fact,  it  was  this  initiative  by  the CCSU which alerted Moody personally (and the League) of the deep-seated problems of the black working class in Britain. The League acted quickly. On 13 April 1935, George W. Brown and P. Cecil Lewis, members of the League,  arrived  in  Cardiff  and  the  same  day  began  their  investigation, returning to London with a full report on 19 April.

The report revealed a scandalous situation. The authorities were accused of  wilful  misapplication  of  the  Aliens  Order  of  1920  and  the  Special Restriction (Coloured  Alien Seamen)  Order  of 1925.  Apparently all coloured men were classified as aliens, in spite of indisputable evidence of their  British  nationality. 9 The  League  had  to  face  the  police  and  the shipowners who were supported by the trade unions. Once the facts were established, the League quickly got to work. Spearheading the attack was Moody. He contacted the Unemployment Branch of the Board of Trade and the  Unemployment Assistance  Board,  and  visited  Cardiff  where  he  made

strong representations to the authorities on the matter. In the fight against this injustice, Captain Arthur Evans, MP for Cardiff, forwarded details of 12 cases to the Home Secretary who cancelled their alien registrations.

Moody was thorough in his efforts to redress these gross grievances. He met W. R. Spence, officials of the National Seamen's Union, and Sir Vernon Thomson,  chief  of  the  shipping  subsidy.  Further,  a  memorandum  was presented  to  the  British  Shipping  Federation  and  G.  H.  Hall  MP.  These efforts brought the matter to the attention of the highest authorities and the British  public.  Consequently,  large  numbers  of  black  seamen  had  their British nationality rightly restored to them. 10 The leading light in this matter (as indeed in so many other issues involving the League) was Moody. To understand the true nature of the League of Coloured Peoples, why it came into existence and how it developed, it is necessary to understand the life of Harold Moody.

## Harold Moody: black moderate (founder and leader of the LCP)

Harold  Moody  arrived  at  Paddington  Station  as  a  22-year-old  student  in September  1904. 11   From  the  moment  he  said  goodbye  to  his  family  in Kingston, it seemed he became progressively aware of his colour. He did not, however, allow this to deter him. Although his natural merry humour helped  him,  it  was  not  long  before  he  had  his  first  brush  with  colour prejudice in London.

On arrival at the Young Men's Christian Association in London, he was given  several  addresses  where  he  might  obtain  lodging.  Significantly, everyone turned him away. He spent hours wearily wandering the streets of London  (as  so  many  immigrants  before  him  had  done)  before  he  found himself  in  the  top  garret  of  a  house  in  St  Paul's  Road,  Canonbury. As  a prospective student in the mother country, he naturally expected more from her, but she had given him anything but a warm welcome.

Moody was born in Kingston, Jamaica on 8 October 1882. His mother was  denied  the  privilege  of  scholastic  education  but  she  learned  quickly. During  his  school  days,  Mrs  Moody  insisted  that  young  Harold  should make friends 'with those fairer than himself and harbour no feelings of race distinction'. Mrs Moody was very religious and it was no surprise that her

son became a diligent student of the Bible, and a devout Christian. She tried to get the best education for her son. Fortunately, she succeeded and he was set to become a medical student in London, a rare achievement for a black man at that time. Before he left Jamaica, one of his friends asked what was his greatest ambition. Harold replied. 'To do something for the Race.' 12

In London Moody realised how little he knew of Jamaica. London gave him  the  right  perspective.  He  found  that  he  was  more  familiar  with  the names  and  places  in  Britain  than  those  of  Jamaica.  This  disturbed  him deeply, and was a factor in determining many aspects of his later advocacy and agitation. It was clear to him that he had been brought up in a British and not a West Indian tradition, as such. Indeed, he was almost completely ignorant of the culture and history of his own race. He had been educated away  from  his  native  heritage  and  towards  the  country  which  he  had learned to call home. In other words, the white bias was predominant. This revelation had serious repercussions on his attitude and personality. He was black, but refused 'to admit that he was an African or that he was in any way  related  to  Africa'. 13 For  him  and  his  race,  this  was  tragic.  He  was disturbed by the fact that he was English in education and upbringing, but in temperament he was not. The nagging question was: Where did he really belong?

Moody the activist was a popular speaker at students meetings and was honoured with election to the Presidency of the College Christian Union. When he left King's College, he moved to King's College Hospital, then situated in Lincoln's Inn Fields where he did his clinical training. There, he again confronted colour prejudice among his fellow students. He resolved to stand his ground (rather than bow to the pressure) particularly in view of the many black students who were given tickets of leave from the hospital so that they could pursue their studies elsewhere. His perseverence paid off. His academic  successes  during  training were  glittering; he won  the Warneford Prize and Medal and the Barry Prize in 1906, the Leathes Prize in  1907,  the Tanner  Prize  in  Obstetrics,  and  the Todd  Medal  and  Prize  in Clinical Medicine in 1910. During this year, he was a qualified MRCS and LRCP but could not, for financial reasons, obtain an actual Diploma until the  following  year.  He  completed  his  academic  qualifications  in  1912  by securing the degrees of MB and BS of the University of London. In 1919 he was awarded the 'coveted' degree of MD. Moreover, he was elected as a

member of the Fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine, and in 1925 contributed a paper on 'The Case for Diagnosis' for the Society's journal. 14

As a fully qualified doctor he made a trip back to Jamaica in 1912. On his return to London, he began his practice at Peckham, London. Later he married  a  white  nurse,  Olive  Tranter,  whom  he  had  worked  with  at  the Royal  Eye  Hospital.  This  marriage  of  black  and  white  caused  such  deep anxiety  in  the  families  on  both  sides  that  some  twenty-five  years  later Moody reflected:

I have  always  held  that  marriage  is  an  individual,  private  and personal  matter  concerning  only  the  two  contracting  parties  with which no one has the right to interfere as long as the parties are of age and independent. This does not seem to be the general point of view of the English people and at almost every meeting I am asked the  question  'What  about  intermarriage?'  as  if  a  girl  could  not  do anything worse than to marry a man of colour. Disparity of union be it racial, social, economic or educational, is to be deplored, but I see no reason why two persons, more or less equal in their educational and  social  opportunities,  who  believe  that  they  love  each  other sufficiently  to  overcome  any  differences  of  temperament  and  to contract  marriage,  should  be  prevented  from  entering  upon  such  a contract. 15

After nine years in England, Moody had an established practice, a home of his own and a wife and four children. Indeed, his family responsibilities were many. Christian service, however, had always been 'the breath of life' to him.  He  devoted  much  time  and  energy  to  the  work  of  Clifton Congregational  Church  on Asylum  Road.  It  was  here  that  he  first  made contact with the people of Peckham. Through his practice and ministerial duties he aroused a deep affection among the local people.

In  July  1919,  Moody  set  out  with  his  wife  and  four  children  for  a holiday  in  Jamaica.  Because  of  a  coalminers'  strike  in  Britain,  the  ship called at an American port to fill her bunkers. While this was being done, passengers  were  allowed  to  visit  the  beach  with  their  children.  When Moody attempted to do so, he was told that it was reserved for white people only. This colour bar stirred deep feelings within him. He wrote in his diary,

I pray that God will help me to do something to alter this awful state of things. It is a huge problem with many intricacies but I pray God to give me grace, strength, ability and tact to do something to show the  world  that  character  and  not  colour  is  the  thing  of  ultimate importance. I will not and shall not apologise for my birth . 16

In Jamaica, he took the opportunity of travelling beyond the geographical boundary of his youth in Kingston. The experience brought a clearer vision in his mind of his responsibility to his own kith and kin. He felt he was on the  threshold  of  a  great  undertaking.  He  returned  to  London  with  a  clear commitment to fight in the name of his Christian faith and his beloved race. Earlier, in the 1920s, his fellow Jamaican, Marcus Garvey, though in a quite different way, also taught the black man to see beauty in himself.

## The formation of the League

In putting his campaign into effect, Moody was mindful of the need to use every means at his disposal. His missionary work was important in tackling the  issue  of  race.  No  one  could  discredit  his  work  for  the  Colonial Missionary  Society.  In  1912,  he  was  elected  as  President  of  the  Young People's  Branch  of  the  Society  and  that  same  year  was  also  appointed  a member of the Board of Directors. This afforded him access to the inner councils of British Congregationalism in the Dominions and Colonies of the Empire. He was the first Black person to enter the inner sanctum.

Moody felt this  campaign  should  express  itself  through  the  CMS.  He began to put all his experiences of the problems of Blacks in perspective, drawing together his own experiences at college and hospital, the appeals made to him during the First World War by black men serving in the British armed forces and his growing knowledge of the practice of the colour bar at many levels of human society. On top of it all, he placed his concern for his people in Jamaica.

Soon  he  was  depressed  to  find  that  his  burning  passion  to  eradicate injustice was rebuffed and met with calmness and complacency in those to whom he had appealed. He could not come to grips with the fact that big organisations moved slowly and that often the watchword in the hierarchy was  careful  consideration  and  caution.  This  realisation  forced  him  to concede that the time was not right for the action which he desired. He felt

he could not rely on others; he would carry the message himself. In fact, there was no shortage of opportunity for him to do so. Invitations to preach and  speak  came  increasingly  from  all  parts  of  the  country.  He  was  well received wherever he went to speak. His natural eloquence held the close attention of audiences. And so willy-nilly, his one-man crusade pressed on and grew in popularity.

In 1921 he was highly honoured. As if to compensate for its failure to give full, unqualified commitment to Moody's racial equality crusade, the Society  elected  him  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  Thus,  he became the first black man to occupy that position. He did not see this as tokenism.  Through  this  act,  the  CMS  was  seen  to  free  itself  from  racial prejudice, to show its opposition to the colour bar, and display its Christian belief that there is 'neither bond nor free, black nor white and all men are brothers'. 16 Moody  used his new office to proclaim the Society's commitment. His reputation as a champion of the rights  of  black  people, and a fearless fighter against all race prejudice became firmly established. Word  of  his  campaign  reached  the  distant  colonies  of  the  Empire.  Many were  impressed  and  hopeful  that  he  would  gain  for  them  full  British citizenship which they regarded as their minimum right.

In  the  fight  for  such  rights,  his  home  became  the  hub  of  activity  and fellowship and often the place of call for many who came to Britain to gain further  education,  training  and  wider  experience  in  their  vocations  and professions. Moreover, black workers turned to Moody  in an ever increasing stream for help in the many difficulties they encountered due to their  colour.  Moody  offered  his  counsel  to  all,  particularly  on  jobs  and housing. His telephone rang frequently.

Prejudiced  employers  posed  enormous  problems  and  while  Blacks suffered  gross  indignities,  Moody  remained  receptive,  sympathetic  and helpful. He believed that reason rather than threats and bullying should be the approach in dealing with prejudiced employers.

In fighting his cause, Moody  was  always  Christianlike.  He  was supported  by  'white  Britishers'  who  were  disturbed  by  the  existence  of racial prejudice and were willing to join him in his fight against the colour bar and every manifestation of unjust discrimination. The majority of those who joined him were fellow Christians. He also sought the assistance and prestige of high officers of the church where he was 'accepted as an equal

amongst them and was conscious of no barrier in their company'. 17  Indeed, he had come a long way and made a full adjustment (unlike his unlettered black  brothers)  in  British  society.  He  used  the  respect  he  had  gained  to enlist, during the addresses at large assemblies, sympathetic forces for his campaign.  He  used  his  Chairmanship  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the Colonial Missionary Society to full effect. Meanwhile his personal reputation and prestige continued to grow.

In  1931,  he  was  elected  as  the  President  of  the  London  Christian Endeavour Federation. While  he  realised  he  could  not  put  any  narrow  or sectarian  construction  on  his  leadership,  he  was  able  to  preach  freedom from any attitude of racial distinction and belief in the brotherhood of man in a 'vivid and practical way'. He rose to the challenge of proclaiming his message of racial equality. But he did this tactfully, always in the context of the  Christian  gospel,  for  he  was  an  exponent  of  the  whole  of  'Christian truth'  and  an  advocate  of  the  'Christian  way  of  life'.  He  saw  his  special mission  not  as  a  restriction,  but  as  liberty.  With  this  deep  belief,  he committed himself with great enthusiasm to his work. News of the honour of  leadership,  conferred  on  Moody,  spread  throughout  the  'Negro  World' and  beyond.  With  time  his  influence  grew.  The  number  of  those  who expressed  support  for  his  racial  ideals  multiplied  amongst  Blacks  and Whites.  However,  while  audiences  caught  his  inspiring  message  and enthusiasm at meetings, at the end, they found there was nothing specific that  they  could  relate  to.  They  were  left  only  with  'the  right  attitude  of mind'. He called men and women to fight for the cause of racial justice, but could  not  mobilise  their  ready  response.  The  drawback  here  was  that  the Christian  church  had  more  urgent  business  to  perform  and  could  not concentrate on race. While the Missionary Society was concerned with this question (which had a real bearing on its work) it could not accept it as the reason  for  its  existence.  This  was  precisely  the  attitude  of  all  the  other sympathetic organisations and societies. The result was that Moody found himself heading considerable forces which lacked the direction and fighting power of an organised and disciplined group. Without the full and sincere cooperation of his compatriots, he realised that his objectives could not be achieved. At this stage in his campaign Moody's ambivalence was evident.

Of the racial groups being formed at the time, he wrote, 'They meet in the white man's premises, accept and enjoy his hospitality and at the same time breathe out wrath against him.' He was dissatisfied and distressed after

addressing one of these groups. 'How damaging is the result', he said, 'and how futile for a group of coloured people, a mere handful, to meet in this way. They cannot hope to achieve anything of value this way and they are damaging  their  own  souls.' 18 On  their  own,  these  disparate  bodies  could achieve little. Moody was acutely aware of the need for co-ordination.

He met with  officials  of  several  sections  to  explore  the  possibility  of uniting to form a big organisation which would bring together both black and white peoples. This unity was his great hope. One of the people Moody met  at  this  time  was  Dr  Charles  Wesley,  an Afro-American  Professor  of History at Howard University who was visiting England. After Dr Wesley had spoken to the Central Young Men's Christian Association, Moody put forward to the meeting (an unusually large congregation of his own people) the idea of one united organisation in the interests of the welfare of all black people.  Although  nothing  positive  resulted  (apart  from  Wesley's  keen interest in the scheme) Moody's proposals received a general welcome. He was encouraged. Later, a mass meeting was arranged at which Dr Wesley spoke  on  the  question  of  a  united  organisation  of  black  peoples,  with Moody presiding. A 'full  and  keen'  discussion  followed  and  a  committee was  set up  to examine  the  possibilities of establishing the kind of organisation  advocated  by  Moody.  This  committee  met  at  164  Queens Road, and again on Friday 13 March 1931 at the Central YMCA, Tottenham Court Road, London, where it was decided to form the League of Coloured Peoples.  This  positive  move  was  a  step  forward  of  great  significance. Personally  Moody  had  won  an  important  victory  in  the  campaign  he  had been  conducting  virtually  single-handedly,  with  occasional  confrontations on  specific  issues,  for  a  number  of  years.  With  rank  and  file  support,  he could  hope  for  the  solid  support  and  co-operation  which  he  desperately needed to effect a successful campaign. Through the LCP he was now able to  channel  the  interest,  sympathy  and  zeal  aroused  in  members  of  the congregations and audiences which he addressed.

In effect, the LCP was the focal point, providing the necessary thrust in his campaign. Thus fortified he could make representations to government authorities, hospital managements, medical faculties, commercial concerns, factory  proprietors,  hotel  and  boarding  house  keepers,  among  others,  not only  in  his  own  name,  status  and  reputation,  but  also  in  the  name  of  the black community in Britain and throughout the Empire. Thus, he became the  recognised  leader  of  his  people  in  Britain,  being  elected  the  first

President of the League of Coloured Peoples. With devotion and sacrifice he  served  the  League's  cause,  holding  the  post  of  President  continuously until  his  death  in  1947.  In  many  senses,  'the  League  was  his  life  and  it would not be untrue to say that he was the life of the League'. 19

## The LCP: development and issues

The first two years of the League's existence involved strenuous efforts but meagre results.  Many  of  its  activities  centred  on  the  needs  of  students  in London; for example, in arranging social functions, meetings and conferences on their behalf. Achievement of the League's objects seemed remote then. It was hampered by a lack of publicity without which it was difficult to maintain the interest of its members and attract the attention of others. The League's only means of exposure was through occasional short reports in the press of its main activities and publication of some letters to newspaper  editors.  This was  a  major  obstacle to growth.  A  regular periodical of its own was indispensable. But finance was the problem since its members  were  largely  students  with  limited  resources;  those  few working  class  members  of  its  essentially  middle-class  membership  were even less well-off. Moreover, large donations could not be expected, though many appeals were made. Finally, in spite of the financial risks involved in undertaking  such  a  project,  the  League  had  to  be  positive.  Eventually,  a decision was taken.

And  so  in  July  1933,  the  first  number  of The  Keys appeared  as  the official organ of the League of Coloured Peoples. This quarterly publication received  its  name  from  the  inspiration  of  the  African  Dr  Aggrey  who asserted  that  the  fullest  musical  harmony  could  be  expressed  only  by  the use of black and white keys on the piano. Indeed, the League explained in the  first  issue  that  the  name  was  symbolic  of  what  it  was  striving  for, namely, the opening of the doors now closed to coloured peoples and the harmonious cooperation of the races.

Earlier that year, the League held its first weekend conference at High Leigh,  Hoddesdon.  This  was  attended  by  representatives  from  Bermuda, Great  Britain,  Kamboli,  Ceylon,  Barbados,  the  Gold  Coast,  East  Africa, India, Jamaica, Australia, St Lucia, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and the USA. 20 The issues discussed at the Conference covered a wide range, such as 'The

American  Negro',  'The  West  African',  'The  West  Indian',  'The  Indian Student', 'The East African' and 'Co-operatives in Africa'. Moody glowed with satisfaction over the fellowship displayed and the serious application of alert minds to the problems of his own race by his own people. 21

After  the  Conference,  the  League's  future  seemed  assured.  While  the publication and launching of The Keys and  the  Conference at High Leigh were high spots, most of the League's work, though monotonous, comprised the day-to-day work of assisting individuals in their difficulties and  with  their  problems.  Occasionally,  people  from  the  colonies  found themselves in difficulties in Britain through no fault of their own, and by means of cablegram, letters, interviews (and in other ways) the League was able to help them. Moody's personal influence played a large part.

The League's work could not be restricted because of the wide range of issues brought before it. For the many less fortunate members of the black working class in London, the League cared. The social value of the League was, at least, increasingly being recognised. Many important contacts were made. Indeed, it was at one of these parties of the LCP that Kenyatta first met Gandhi, who was visiting England. 22

Three years after the League's formation, Moody's responsibilities had grown  heavier.  He  attended  numerous  meetings  and  made  numerous representations  on  behalf  of  black  workers.  But  there  was  a  limit  to  his work rate.  In The  Keys of  October  1934  he  informed  readers  that  after  a very stormy three and a half years,

I  have  been  compelled  to  inform  my  Executive  that  owing  to  the great demand  made  upon my  time and my  finances I feel constrained to ask them to accept my  resignation from the Presidency as from March next.

He was nevertheless confident of the League's future adding:

I  now  appeal  to  the  African  and  West  Indian  to  cease  bickering among themselves about things which do not matter, to put aside all petty jealousies and childish petulances and seek to co-operate one with the other for the good of the race. The Englishman may have certain views about us which I have not been slow to state on many platforms up and down the country, but I am more than convinced

that  a  great  many of these views are fostered by ourselves. By far too many of us are lacking in pride of race and are quite-content to be thought English. How can the Englishman respect us if we do not respect ourselves? Also by far too few of us are prepared to put in any solid work for racial development …

There  can  be  no  self-enrichment  without  self-sacrifice.  If  you really are anxious to serve your race, come in and get your training in the League and if you will give unselfishly of your best then I can assure you that you will get such self-improvement as will almost surprise yourself. 23

On the face of it, if the League seemed to have been running smoothly, this  statement  by  Moody  was  a  revelation.  There  were  many  violent disagreements among members of the Executive Committee. Even during the period 1945-53, the LCP's 'inner circle' represented a wide divergence of  political  views.  For  example,  according  to  one  of  the  League's  last secretaries, two of the founder members on the Executive were Dr Belfield Clarke  of  Barbados  (his  name  was  not  listed  in  the  1933-34  Executive printed in The Keys) and Sergeant Roberts of Trinidad who were both rightwingers. George Padmore and Ras Makonnen were Marxists, Sam Morris, General Secretary, a committed anti-colonialist ('always have been, always will  be'),  Desmond  Buckle,  an  active  Communist,  and  Robert Adams,  'a combination  of  the  lot'.  No  wonder  then,  that  Executive  meetings  were 'rough  and  hectic'. 24 This  mixture  was  formidable  opposition  indeed  for Moody, who coped by adopting a reasonably flexible approach if he felt it would help to achieve his objectives.

Commenting on the efforts of white liberals to improve 'race relations', one observer felt that they worked from a middle-class perspective. Thus to them, 'racial equality' implied equality essentially for 'cultured Europeanised'  Blacks  such  as  Paul  Robeson  and  Moody.  Indeed,  many black members of the LCP who mixed in white circles were 'too elitist' to identify with the problems of the black working class. Thus, for the more radical Blacks, such as Padmore and Makonnen, multi-racial organisations such as the LCP only deflected Blacks from a more radical line. 25

Moody, then, was hitting out at some of the radical young students in the Executive who had revolutionary ideas but lacked the experience which

brought as he saw it, wisdom. Cocooned within their schools and colleges, Moody felt they needed to be exposed to the realities of ordinary life. In this conflict  between  Moody  and  his  detractors  on  the  Executive,  the  radical faction  were  convinced  that  a  more  militant  approach  could  become operational were it not for the intransigence of vested interests, power and authority.  Moody  had  no  confidence  in  revolutionary  methods  which  he regarded as more destructive than creative. But, was not destruction also a creative force?

It was clear that Moody loved Britain and the British, although he often expressed anger over British policy. He firmly believed that only by mutual understanding and trust could they see their responsibilities to the 'coloured peoples'.  Given  these  opposed  views  of  the  contending  parties  in  the Executive, they were bound to quarrel.

There  was  also  disagreement  over  the  phrase  in  the  League's  title: 'Coloured  Peoples'.  What  exactly  did  it  mean?  To  Moody  it  meant members  of  the  'Negro  race',  particularly  those  in  Africa  and  the  West Indies who were under British rule, though there were cordial relations with the  National  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Coloured  Peoples  in America. Some members of the Executive, on the other hand, held that the title  should  include  Chinese  and  other  Orientals.  Moreover,  they  claimed that the League should accept Indians in Africa and British Guiana where 43  per  cent  of  the  population  were  Indians.  In  spite  of  these  arguments, Moody won the day, carrying the Committee with him. But the disenchanted  faction  remained  unconvinced.  In  effect,  as  Moody  saw  it, they hampered the unity, purpose and action on which the League's future depended.

Divisions and differences of opinion, though necessary, were blamed on external factors. For Moody the divisive issue was the fact that many of his young Committee members had been conditioned by the environment and the philosophy of pragmatism and materialism. They were attracted to the experiments of Russian Communism and its Marxian economic doctrines. This  was  anathema  to  Moody  who  believed  that  the  'foundation  of  all things was the Christian religion and the true realities were spiritual and not material'. 26 It was abundantly clear then, given Moody's leadership, that the aims of the League could and would be attained only through the Christian way.

Nevertheless,  the  sharp  criticisms  of  Moody's  opponents  hurt  him deeply. While he cared about 'the absence of unity' he was not willing to compromise. Although this dichotomy discouraged and depressed him, 'he maintained his outward geniality and carried his sorrows in the secret of his own heart'.

Admirable as his bearing was, he made no peace with his critics. At the expense of disunity, he was content to wallow in self-righteousness, though aware of the damage he could do. The months between October 1934 and January 1935 were painful for Moody. Eventually, he made his decision 'to part company with the child of his dreams'. While the split in the Executive remained, the final separation did not actually take place. In April 1935 The Keys proclaimed that it was happy to announce that 'Dr Harold Moody has reconsidered  his  decision  to  relinquish  the  Presidency  this  year  and  was unanimously  re-elected  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting.'  The  journal reminded readers that Moody had been President of the League throughout most of its critical years and had gained an insight into its problems which would prove invaluable in the task ahead: 'A man of courage and ability', it added,  'he  will  be  able  to  impart  the  touch  of  leadership  which  is  the strength of every organisation.' 27

Given this confidence in him, Moody responded:

The overwhelming expression of opinion opposing my decision to resign and other happenings have compelled me to alter my decision and  to  accept  the  unqualified  mandate  of  the  League  of  Coloured Peoples and to continue in office a while longer … The objective of the League is, as it has been since its inception, to unite the various elements of our race and kind for the teaching of Jesus Christ and I willingly lend a part of my life and work to the League in this fight to serve in accordance with his standards of goodwill and morality. Present happenings in neurotic Europe point to the re-disturbance of peace on earth by another war. What is to be the attitude of negroes throughout the world to this new conflict? 28

These last words were indeed vital as Blacks faced an uncertain future.

The  League's  work  continued  under  Moody's  'wise  and  vigorous' leadership.  Christian  people  were  generous  subscribers  to  the  League's funds.  Members  of  the  League  were  welcome  at  all  kinds  of  church

functions and many black (middle class?) people were received in Christian homes 'as guests without suspicion or prejudice'.

The wider interests of Africans, however, were always in the mind of Moody and the League. Moody led a deputation to see J. H. Thomas, the Colonial Secretary in London, following the Governor's suspension of the Tshekedi from his position as Paramount Chief of the Bamangwato Tribe in Bechuanaland.  Moody  also  sent  a  strongly  worded  letter  to  Thomas concerning  the  proposal  to  incorporate  Bechuanaland,  Basutoland  and Swaziland in the Union of South Africa, and pointed out the unsatisfactory nature of the policy of the Union government in matters of native affairs. In Britain,  at  Moody's  instigation,  questions  were  asked  in  the  House  of Commons and all decisions and actions were monitored.

Sixteen  years  after  the  Cardiff  race  riots  in  1919,  there  were  an estimated 3000 black seamen, most of whom were in distress. 29  In 1935, British merchant shipping in this Welsh port, among others, was depressed.

Among  the  working  class  issues  on  which  the  League  intervened following  the  Cardiff  racial  'riots'  and  the  subsequent  depression  in  the shipping industry were the call for repatriation of the black community and the unemployment and distress of black seamen as it related to pressure and deliberate trickery by the police, employers and trade unions to get all black seamen to submit to compulsory registration as 'Seamen' aliens. Furthermore, the LCP published a report of its findings after investigation of  the  inadequate  Unemployment Assistance  and  depressed  conditions  of the black community, particularly in areas of serious and urgent need such as the social, cultural and educational underdevelopment.

So devastating was the destitution and oppression of the Blacks that the representations of the League were questioned. Clearly, The Keys was then, and remained throughout its existence, the organ of a well-intentioned but distant black elite. The black seamen, aware of this, and having themselves formed  the  Coloured  Colonial  Seamen's  Union,  would  have  preferred  to participate fully in the representations made by Moody on their behalf. It is therefore  not  surprising  that  black  workers  in  Cardiff  resisted  being  led from  above  by  'superior'  outsiders. 30 More  particularly,  they  may  have resented The Keys '  appeal  to  readers  to  help  by  employing  black  girls  as domestics .

Opposition from black workers to this form of employment is understandable when one considers that the very people who were baying for  repatriation  of  the  Blacks  from  Cardiff  (some  of  them  liberal  social investigators)  were  the  very  people  who  regarded  this  occupation  as  the upper  limit  of  black  womanhood,  decency  and  capability.  Why  not  more education, social facilities and better opportunities?

Interestingly, and  regrettably,  although  the  League  recruited  many members, it tried unsuccessfully to establish a permanent branch in Cardiff. This  was  partly  due  to  the  fact  that  seamen  were  continuously  toing  and froing, and also because there was deep suspicion among black workers of the  LCP's  middle-class  leadership.  The  local  black  leaders  'were  not prepared … to have a middle class London organisation control the Cardiff race relations situation'.

For  the  black  population  comprising  Africans,  West  Indians,  Malays, Somalis,  Indians  and  others,  discrimination  meant  they  were  precluded from employment on subsidised ships. 31  In effect, by the stroke of a pen, hundreds of these men were denied their only means of livelihood. Their common  grievances  led  to  organisation  in  the  form  of  the  Coloured Colonial Seamen's Union.

Naturally, this union turned to the LCP for help on such matters as the Alien  Order  (1920)  and  the  Special  Restriction  (Colonial  Alien  Seamen) Order (1925). The League, at least, was determined to establish the facts. Moody thoroughly involved himself on behalf of the black seamen in an effort  to  rectify  the  gross  injustices  of  these  Orders.  Moreover,  when  the officers of SS Eskdalegate refused to sign on five Jamaicans, though they had  been  regularly  employed  on  that  ship,  Moody  immediately  contacted Messrs Turnbull, Scott and Company, the London owners of the ship, and Sir Vernon Thomson of the Tramp Shipping Subsidy Committee. While the shipowners simply confirmed the facts, Thomson assured Moody that if the men  were  Jamaicans  they  would  be  allowed  to  sail.  The  men  were  reengaged and sailed. This was one of many cases on which Moody had been successful on behalf of members of his race in the manual trades and 'could no  longer  be  accused  of  interest  only  in  the  student  and  professional classes'. 32 It is surprising that he took so long to come to their aid. In fact, the  conditions  of  black  seamen  in  Cardiff  and  Liverpool  docks  were eyesores  which  could  not  have  failed  notice.  Nevertheless,  the  League's

investigation brought to light startling facts about the social and economic condition of the black community in Cardiff and elsewhere in Britain. Put simply,  these  people  were  left  to  languish.  Practically  no  provision  was made for the social and cultural life of black people and many of them were on or below 'a very low poverty line'. 33

Moody's  spiritual  beliefs  were  now  assuming  a  more  material  form. Mindful  of  his  own  children,  he  was  disturbed  and  anxious  about  the welfare of the children of mixed marriages. On the prospects for jobs for 'coloured' children between 14 and 18 years of age, he felt it was a wellknown fact that no black boy or girl could procure a job in any office no matter how qualified. No engineering works was willing to employ them, and apart from shipping, they had no outlet. He asked, 'Is there no Christian man big enough to tackle this task and blaze a trail for the kingdom of God? Surely  there  is?'  Unfortunately,  Moody's  attention  was  on  the  individual rather than the system which produced and showed  every sign of prolonging this tragedy.

In  the  interests  of  these  adolescents,  he  wrote  to  the  authorities  in Swansea,  Hull,  South  Shields,  Glasgow,  Liverpool,  London  and  Cardiff, and held discussions with the officers of the Juvenile Employment Bureaux. Moreover, the  British  Social  Hygiene  Council  made  an  investigation  into the wider aspects of the problem. A tireless worker, with missionary zeal, Moody visited Cardiff several times to assess the situation. Increasingly, the black populations of the British seaports became the centre of his concern. (We shall return later to Moody's relations with local black groups during the 'Cardiff Crisis'.)

But, in spite of the gravity of these problems, Moody was not parochial in his concerns. His Pan Africanist approach took precedence. At the time, African affairs were of central international interest because of the Italian attack on Abyssinia. A mass meeting of the LCP, held on 4 September 1935, unanimously adopted a resolution which reflected not merely an expression of opinion on the invasion, but a statement of policy on the future of Africa. In  it  the  League  expressed  its  utmost  co-operation  with  the  Emperor  of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian people 'in the deep shadow of war', which hung over their beloved country and felt that this attitude of a European country towards an African people was a reflection of a deep-seated conviction in the minds of most European peoples that African peoples were ordained to be serfs. The League hoped that this idea would be dispelled once and for

all,  and  that  Europe  would  begin  to  recognise  Africa  and  the  African peoples as equal partners with her in the great task of human development, and  that  the  European  would  no  longer  exploit  the  African  but  would concede his demands of directing his own affairs. Moreover, he urged the European countries which wielded authority in Africa that 'the time is now ripe  for  them  to  consider  a  plan  for  the  future  of Africa  which  should  be nothing  less  than  the  ultimate  and  complete  freedom  of Africa  from  any domination whatsoever'. 34

While the League was struggling against the colour bar and race, world events  reflected  these  issues.  Hitler  was  implementing  a  policy  of  racial superiority against the Jews in Germany. And in the United States, the case of the Scottsboro boys was another aspect of racial discrimination. With the start of the blitz, many members of the International African Service Bureau refused to be recruited in the war effort. According to Ras Makonnen, the radical Pan Africanist, 'There is only one war we will fight. It is the war against Britain. So don't tell us about Hitler. We are not interested. We are only concerned about the man who is on our shoulders now.' 35

Authoritative measures taken by the colonial governments in St Vincent and the Gold Coast introduced powers of censorship. Whatever the merits of  these  imperial  directives  elsewhere  in  the  Empire,  matters  had  already gone  beyond  recall.  A  series  of  disturbances  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago,  St Kitts, British Guiana and St Lucia resulted in many civilians being killed, wounded and arrested by the repressive imperial and colonial forces.

To say the least, labour conditions in these colonies were deplorable. 36 The  low  price  of  sugar  led  to  the  collapse  of  the  sugar  monoculture;  an industry  on  which  so  much  was  dependent.  Several  hundred  thousand labourers and their families faced starvation. After a long gestation period in ferment, they rebelled. Then there was the special case of South Africa where  the  Union  had  introduced  a  new  native  franchise  policy  which  in effect denied Africans the right of a direct vote. They were to be represented by four white men in the Senate, 'an effective chamber'. Moreover, a new body, a 'Native Advisory Council' was to be established with, predictably, no executive or legislative powers.

There were also serious risings among workers in the copper mines of Northern  Rhodesia  against  a  poll-tax  equal  to  a  month's  wages.  In  the

confrontation, government forces were reinforced by support from Southern Rhodesia. Tear gas was used to control the workers. 37

Given  black  rebellion  in  the  colonies,  Moody  used  his  undoubted influence in Britain by sending letters and cables and making speeches and giving  interviews  on  these  international  matters. As  a  colonial  himself  he was particularly concerned.

When  the representatives of the Dominions, colonies and other territories  came  to  Britain  in  1937  for  the  Coronation  of  King  George VI and  Queen  Elizabeth,  Moody,  the  opportunist,  played  an  active  part  in cementing the bonds of fellowship between the peoples (white and black) of the British Commonwealth.

Among the English upper classes, Moody was well-received. But this did not actively help him to reach the objectives he sought. In the midst of many  pleasantries,  he  was  patient.  But  all  this  was  marred  by  events  in Jamaica  and  other  parts  of  the  West  Indies,  where  the  deplorable  living conditions of the working  class provoked  unprecedented  riots. High unemployment and low or nonexistent poor relief were indefensible.

Furthermore,  the  education  system  was  in  need  of  reforms,  and  bad housing was prevalent. Following major strikes in Trinidad and Barbados, Moody contacted a 'sympathetic' Secretary of State, Malcolm MacDonald and  led  a  deputation  of  representatives  of  the  League,  the  Union  of Democratic  Control,  the  National  Council  of  Civil  Liberties,  and  the Colonial Information Bureau. He seemed to be the spokesman for the black population in Britain. The position of black people in Britain was reflected by  that of their fellow  Blacks  in  the  colonies.  Moody  seized  every opportunity  to  develop  this  relationship.  In  doing  so  he  had  willing accomplices. The Times published three of his letters and at a meeting held (in June) at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, a resolution was sent to the  press  and  colonial  office,  which  expressed  horror  at  the  bloodshed  in Jamaica, where since 3 May 1938, no fewer than 11 persons had been killed and a large number wounded in the disturbances which arose from the effort of the Jamaican workers to improve their intolerable conditions. It called on the  British  government,  on  the  basis  of  an  economic  survey  and  a  full enquiry  into  the  political  and  economic  structure  of  the  islands,  to  take immediate active steps to improve the economic condition of the population;  in  particular,  to  ensure  and  protect  a  market  for  West  Indian products  at  reasonable  prices  and  by  redistributing  the  land  so  as  to

establish a large and prosperous peasantry. Moreover, the resolution called upon  the  British  government  to  give  universal  free  education  up  to university  standard  and  to  establish  a  University  of  the  West  Indies;  to ensure that these measures were not thwarted by local vested interests; to grant the people of Jamaica and of all the British West Indian islands the same constitutional rights and the same civil liberties as those enjoyed by the people of Britain, including universal adult suffrage and the removal of the  property  qualification  for  members  of  the  Legislature;  to  form  a Federation of the West Indies with complete self-government, with the hope that on the Commission to be appointed by His Majesty's Government there would be at least two representatives of West Indian labour. 38

When the Royal Commission was appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Moyne,  it contained two representatives of the British labour movement, Walter Citrine and Morgan Jones MP, but no representative for West Indian labour. The Commission's terms of reference were to investigate social and economic conditions in the British West Indies 'and matters connected therewith and to make recommendations'. It was found, however, that political questions were not included nor was the constitutional  issue.  Moody  pointed  this  out  to  Malcolm  Macdonald  who said  that  the  words  'and  matters  connected  therewith',  were  deliberately included  so  that  consideration  of  the  constitutional  or  any  other  aspect should not be excluded.

The League took every opportunity provided by the appointment of this important  Commission  to  further  its  cause.  It  drew  up  and  gave  wide publicity  to  a  document  which  set  out  a  minimum  programme  of  change and development in the West Indies. This attributed the discontent there to the widespread poverty of the people, the failure of the government to take appropriate  steps  to  improve  conditions  and  the  absence  of  machinery through  which  the  people  could  press  their  claim  and  express  their grievances  -  in  other  words,  the  lack  of  constitutional  liberty.  Further,  it stated,  'For  one  people  to  dominate  another  is  unchristian  and  cannot  but have evil results. The time has now come to put an end to this domination, to  remove  the  distinction  between  a  commonwealth  of  free,  prosperous, self-governing peoples and an empire of poverty-stricken vassals.' 39

The League was using strong language and becoming more insistent in its  demands.  In  support  of  these  demands  Moody  received  the  sympathy

and  backing  of  the  Congregational  Union  of  England  and  Wales,  the National Free Church Council and the Fellowship of Reconciliation, among other  bodies.  Moody  himself  travelled  to  all  parts  of  Britain  to  address meetings.

While  Moody  and  the  League  awaited  'radical'  recommendations arising from the Commission's investigation into all aspects of West Indian life, events  in  Europe  took  a  gloomy  turn.  As  Hitler  and  Mussolini dominated  the  political  scene,  Moody  and  the  LCP  monitored  the  antisemitic policy in Germany. Racial persecution disturbed Moody for he well understood that persecution of the Jew and persecution of the African were inseparable matters. Both were wrong for the same reason, namely that they violated and denied the basic natural rights of the human personality.

World-wide  colour  conflict  and  racial  prejudice  kept  Moody  and  the LCP  busy.  In  the  process  of  making  representations,  they  received  wide publicity. Due to the cancellation of the League's Annual Christmas Sale in 1939, its finances were depleted. The League was forced to cut back on its expenditure. Consequently, its work was put on a voluntary basis and the offices were now the home of Moody. In the circumstances, The Keys was suspended and News  Notes , a monthly duplicated 'Newsletter' first appeared in October 1939. In that issue Moody wrote:

In common with other organisations, the League has been badly hit as  a  result  of  the  sudden  and  unfortunate  onset  of  War.  It  is  our fervent hope that it will be of short duration, and that from it will emerge freedom for all people, not only in Europe but also in Africa and Asia. True peace cannot reign over the world until the liberty and freedom of the individual is fully recognised and respected and men  and  nations  acknowledge  God  as  their  supreme  and  only Dictator. In the meanwhile the LCP propose to carry on. 40

Given Marx's view that religion was the opium of the masses, Moody was interestingly prepared to trade in one kind of bondage for another! It is therefore not surprising that the Executive Committee was split between the Moody faction and the radicals who wanted a more materialistic approach in tackling the problems confronting Blacks.

The League's work continued nevertheless, and it was soon evident that the need for such work had not diminished, but increased as the 'colour bar'

was  being  practised  at  the  highest  levels.  The  League  chided  the  British government  for  stipulating  in  its  advertisements  for  all  responsible  and executive  posts  in  the  colonies  that  applicants  must  be  of  European parentage. As  the  Second  World  War  loomed  large,  this  question  was  of central importance in granting commissions in the British Armed Forces. It was felt that a full memorandum on the subject of the 'colour bar' in the forces  and  in  the  civil  administration  should  be  prepared  and  copies circulated to all MPs.

In  spite  of  such  devotion,  changes  in  the  colonies  came  slowly  and grudgingly.  When  the  Colonial  Office  stated  on  19  October  1939  that 'British  subjects  from  the  colonies  and  British  protected  persons  in  this country, including those who are not of European descent, are now eligible for  emergency  commissions  in  His  Majesty's  Forces'  Moody,  although thankful, was not satisfied. He said, 'We do not want it only for the duration of the war we want it for all time. If the principle is accepted now surely it must be accepted for all time.' 41 But clearly, this was only the first step on a long journey.

The new policy was tested and Moody's son, Arundel, was one of the first  to  be  accepted  as  an  Officer-Cadet  in  the  British  Army.  Later,  he became a major in the Royal West Kent Regiment, and Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. He concluded his war service as a major in the Caribbean Regiment, commanding it on the return to Jamaica for demobilisation.

During  the  war  (a  time  of  great  hardship)  Moody  felt  the  League's grievances should be muted. Nonetheless, branches of the League were set up in Jamaica, Sierra Leone and British Guiana. Moody was now seeking the help of everyone. He sought to balance independence with co-operation. Thus white people were admitted as members of the League, but could not serve  in  any  of  its  offices  on  the  Executive  Committee.  At  the  Annual Meeting that year he pointed out that the League's publications were quoted extensively in the overseas press, and that no other 'coloured' organisation in Britain had such wide acceptance. He claimed that the British goverment recognised  it  as  the  main  body  representing  the  needs  of  the  coloured peoples.

Moody  was  right  about  the  League's  prestige.  At  the  request  of  the Secretary of State for the colonies it was given the important responsibility of preparing a memorandum setting out its views of the Recommendations of  the  West  India  Royal  Commission.  While  the  League  commented  on

'certain  aspects  of  social  welfare'  and  was  in  'substantial  agreement'  on education,  public  health,  housing,  industrial  legislation  and  transport,  its emphasis was mainly on economic and political questions. 42

When publication of the Report was withheld on the grounds that the conditions in the West Indies revealed in the Report were such as to have been useful to Germany and her propagandists in her anti-British publicity, the  League  protested  against  this  secrecy,  alleging  that  it  hindered  West Indian progress. Although at the time it was difficult to judge the influence of the League's comments and suggestions on the final recommendations, subsequent events have proved their wisdom.

The use and abuse of black people in Britain and abroad was the focal point of the League's concern. During the war, Moody questioned the use of the  word  'nigger'.  He  wrote  to  the  BBC  in  1940,  after  one  of  their announcers when interpreting some records made use of the offensive term 'nigger'.  'There  is  no  need  for  me  to  remind  you  that  this  is  one  of  the unfortunate  relics  of  the  days  of  slavery,  vexatious  to  the  present  day Africans and West Indians and an evidence of incivility on the part of its user. I hope you will take some steps to repair the damage done.' 43

The  fault  was  acknowledged.  Moody  received  an  apology  and  was assured that everything was being done to prevent a repetition. This incident was particularly relevant since an increasing number of West Indians and Africans were arriving in Britain to render their services in all spheres of the war effort. Yet, a colour bar existed, rearing its ugly head in an incident involving  Learie  Constantine,  the  well-known  West  Indian  cricketer  who was also a welfare officer in the Ministry of Labour. Constantine, his wife and daughter and three friends had booked accommodation at a hotel for four nights. When they arrived they were told bluntly that because of their colour  and  the  fact  that Americans  were  staying  there,  they  could  remain only one night. Needless to say, this infuriated Moody who described the incident  as  a  'gross  insult'. Moody's  calmness  and  moderation  were beginning to run out. He wrote, 'Surely the time has now arrived when we should  ask  our  Government  to  bring  in  suitable  legislation  in  order  to prevent  such  unfortunate  occurrences.  We  have  been  against  legislative action  in  the  past  and  have  relied  on  education,  but  this  process  seems tragically slow in its progress towards the goal if indeed it will ever arrive there.' 44

For  this  comment,  Moody  was  compensated  with  British  press  front page  publicity,  even  in  the  midst  of  the  war.  Indeed,  the  war  was  being fought on two fronts. With black and white troops fighting on the same side against Nazi Germany,  influential British officials were sensitive to Moody's comments, particularly on the colour bar and racial prejudice, both in Britain and abroad. His prominence  among  British  Liberals was undisputed.  One  of  the  many  honours  he  received  was  his  election  as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the London Missionary Society in 1943,  after  being  elected  a  year  earlier  as  Deputy  Chairman.  He  was  the first  black  man  to  hold  this  position.  As  head  of  the  British  Missionary Society  he  was  concerned  with  matters  relating  to  Africa,  India,  China, Madagascar, New Guinea and the islands of the South Pacific Ocean, apart from  the  West  Indies.  In  these  lands,  Moody's  Presidency  brought  great hope. The world's press noted the great satisfaction it gave to Africans and their descendants everywhere.

Following his induction, Moody suggested that the religious bodies of Britain and America should immediately meet to consider in detail a speedy plan  for  the  complete  emancipation  of  Africa,  which  should  include  the educational,  social,  economic  and  political  liberation  of  the  continent  and the rapid emergence of Africa as an equal partner in the family of nations. He appreciated that  such  a  plan  would  demand  nothing  less  than  full  cooperation  from  all  the  governments  concerned.  He  urged  that  immediate steps  should  be  taken  to  form  a  competent  and  responsible  council  of Africans which should act in concert with a similar body of Europeans and Americans  to  define  the  future  of  the  African  peoples.  In  this  grandiose plan,  Moody  aimed  to  achieve  the  unity  of  all  Africans  and  the  fullest development of their country's resources, materially, intellectually, morally and  spiritually.  Since  the  end  of  the  war  in  1945,  events  and  needs  of Britain and Europe had made Africa, in many new ways, the centre of their interest.

Political power had become increasingly a central part of his vision. He was invited  to  serve  as  a  member  of  the  Colonial  Office  Committee,  'To examine the question of training at home and overseas, for nurses who are to serve in Colonial territories and to make recommendations for increased public health activities and for the fostering and development of community welfare'. 45

He  sat  on  many  other  bodies,  making  his  presence  felt.  In  February 1947, he became (at the request of the Colonial Secretary) a member of the Colonial Social Welfare Advisory Committee to consider problems affecting urban and rural communities in the colonies, the training of social welfare  workers  and  related  questions.  (Sadly  he  did  not  live  to  attend  a meeting.) He was also Vice-Chairman of the Child Protection Committee of the Save the Children Fund, bringing to bear his abilities and influence on the cause of unfortunate children in Africa, the West Indies and Britain. He was now in a position to influence policies on colonial matters. But was this to  deflect  his  attention  away  from  a  deeper  commitment  to  the  black community in Britain?

Moody's grasp of world events was quick. Indeed, it had to be for this was a major part of his strategy as leader of the League. Important decisions were being made at a high level. Following the promulgation of the Atlantic Charter, by statesmen at the United Nations, which was intended to outline the form and character of the post-war world, Moody arranged a conference in  London  in  July  1944  to  draft  a  'Charter  for  Coloured  Peoples'.  The Charter called upon the governments of the UN to adopt the following:

- 1. The same economic, educational, legal and political rights should be enjoyed by all persons, male and female, whatever their colour. All discrimination in employment, in places of public entertainment and refreshment, or in other public places shall be illegal and shall be punished.
- 2. Governments  administering  dependent  territories  shall  proclaim  this  acceptance  of  and  give effect to the following:
- (a) that comprehensive plans be made  and put into effect in accordance  with  a  definite  time  schedule  for  the  economic, educational,  social  and  political  development  of  the  dependent regions and their peoples and adequate funds provided;
- (b) that all such development shall be in the interests of the regions concerned;
- (c) that  the  educational  plans  shall  in  the  shortest  possible  time enable the peoples of such territories to play their full part in all spheres and at all levels of activities in their own countries;
- (d) that  the  indigenous  peoples  of  all  independent  territories  shall have immediately a majority on all law-making bodies, and shall be granted full self-government at the earliest possible opportunity;
- (e) that imperial  powers  shall  be  required  to  account  for  their administration  of  dependent  territories  to  an  international  body

with powers of investigation, and to make regular reports on the steps taken towards self-government. 46

This  'revolutionary'  document  was  sent  to  every  government  of  the United  Nations  and  to  almost  every  responsible  leader and  national organisation in church and state in many countries. It was widely publicised in  the  British  press  and  especially  in Africa  and  the West  Indies  where  it was enthusiastically received.

While  the  Charter  achieved  no  immediate  results,  it  kept  attention focused  on  the  needs  and  rights  of  the  coloured  peoples.  In  subsequent years, however, many steps were taken in the direction which the Charter pointed.  A  committee  of  the  League  was  appointed  to  investigate  the influence of school textbooks and teaching on the formation of the attitude of British people to race questions. On his last visit to Jamaica Moody had left a manuscript with the intention that it should be printed and circulated so that the work he had begun would continue. Unfortunately, this pamphlet never  appeared.  On  his  return  voyage,  Moody  wrote  a  full  report  of  his experiences and his observations of the problems in the West Indies for the Colonial  Secretary  and  the  Conference  of  British  Missionary  Societies. Sadly, he could not present or expand on them. In fact, Moody was ill when he arrived in Liverpool. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died on 24 April 1947. 47

Although he had little time for extensive writing, he wrote many letters to The Times and other leading British newspapers, occasional articles for various periodicals and many of his sermons were published. He edited, for extended periods, the League's journal, contributing a lengthy Presidential letter  regularly.  He  was  also  the  author  of  four  booklets, Youth and Race, Christianity  and  Race  Relations,  Freedom  for  All  Men ,  and The  Colour Bar . 48

Moody was a man of thought and deed. He directed the League on the stand  taken  on  various  issues.  As  the  leader  of  the  LCP,  he  was  not accountable to a rank and file, since the League could not be said to have had  such  an  organisation.  In  effect,  he  was  the  League's  motivator  and activist. Through sheer force of personality (his undoubted gifts of oratory and  intellect)  and  religious  conviction,  he  became  'acceptable'  and  from this  pulpit,  he  announced  his  plans  for  'coloured  peoples'  and  the  issues

affecting  them,  on  a  grand  scale,  starting  at  Cardiff.  To  this  extent  he succeeded.  Organisationally,  however,  his  greatest  test  as  a  leader  of  the black  community  was  with  black  leaders  and  groups  in  Cardiff  and elsewhere.

## The Cardiff crisis: local organisations and the LCP

In 1935, following the black seaman's forced registration, during a period of 'extreme depression' in the shipping industry, the union was at it again forcing a bill through Parliament which provided quotas on the number of black seamen who could sail on British ships. In effect, virtually all black seamen  became  unemployed.  So  serious  were  the  effects  of  the  Cardiff Crisis  of  1935  that  it  became  'one  of  the  most  important  events  in  the history of race relations in the British Isles'. 49

In this depression the black community had to rely on its resourcefulness.  The  'Crisis'  itself  attracted  strong  views  from  various interested bodies.  While  the  'Liberal-humanitarians'  and  white  labour leaders called for a check on black immigration and voluntary repatriation of black seamen, the Communists insisted on the right of black seamen to stay in Britain and took the opportunity to argue that race prejudice would not  disappear  from  Britain  until  the  colonies  were  freed.  One  of  the staunchest proponents of this Communist challenge was the Indian activist and  Communist  for  Battersea,  Saklatvala. 50 In the  circumstances,  the question of colour could not be avoided. For the Communists. imperialism was  the  cause  of  the  'colour  bar'.  In  post-war  Britain,  the  CommunistSocialist utopia, in its most extreme form, was represented by members of the Comintern, an organisation devoted to bringing about world revolution. Through  its front organisation, the Seamen's  Minority  Movement,  it championed the cause of the black seamen. Another front organisation in Cardiff at the time was the Colonial Defence Association, formed in 1927. Moreover,  the  League  Against  Imperialism  also  occasionally  fought  the black seamen's cause. 51

Given their strong arguments, the Communists aroused much sympathy and a small following. The spectre of black labour in the port of Cardiff had its 'red' implications. For although difficult to prove, as one observer put it,

'it  is  likely  that  concern  over  the  growth  of  the  Communist  movement among coloured people was one factor in stimulating humanitarian circles to begin action on the colour question in the early 1930s'. 52

While  the  above-mentioned  humanitarian  and  communist  associations interested in race relations were white-controlled, between 1931 and 1937, the LCP became an accepted part of the structure of British race relations. The League advocated a Pan African brand of humanitarianism in carrying out its functions as a social club, housing bureau, pressure group, investigative  agency  and  employment  agency.  Moreover,  it  served  as  a 'middle-class validator' and attempted (without success) to play the role of co-ordinator of all race relations agencies.

Harold Moody, ever vigilant to exploit a situation to the advantage of the  LCP,  became  an  adept  manipulator. As  we  saw,  he  not  only  stressed international co-operation but also called for the unity of the black race. He used Pan African sentiments to engender solidarity in order to achieve LCP objectives.  He  felt  that  black  people  'will  never  be  free  until  they  unite among themselves'. 53 Moody, the 'Race Man', constantly pleaded for the unity of people of African descent everywhere. He saw race pride and race loyalty  as  crucial  to  achieving  racial  solidarity.  Although  Whites  were allowed to become League members, Moody considered the League to be an  essentially  black  organisation  with  'white  allies'.  He  asked,  if  black people who sought the uplift of the race could not reach agreement among themselves, and with 'those English folks who are working on our behalf, how then can we ever hope to obtain our objectives?' 54  And in accordance with  his  objectives,  he  was  able  to  maintain  an  Executive  Board  which always constituted representatives from the United States, the West Indies and occasionally, an Asian. 55

With  the  publication  of The  Keys in  January  1933,  the  Pan  African orientation of the LCP reflected Negro news and personalities; injustices as well as achievements were reported. 56 Through The Keys ,  the  LCP  spoke for  the  race  everywhere.  Moody's  attempt  to  get  unity  was  frustrated  by other  Pan African  organisations  because  of  cultural  differences,  not  only national, tribal  and  ethnic,  but  also  in  economic  and  social  class.  For  one thing, Moody's LCP was essentially a middle-class organisation. Moreover, Africans were suspicious of West Indians, among whom there were interisland rivalries. And within the African group there were further groupings,

such as the West African Students' Union, and the Gold Coast Students. To compound the difficulties of effecting unity, the British-born Blacks were essentially working-class and of lower standing in terms of the social status of the students and professional classes.

Recognising these difficulties, the left-wing black intellectual elite tried to  bring Blacks together in the various Labour and Marxist groups. 57  The 'dictatorial'  Moody  was  saddened  by  the  dissension  in  the  small  black community. 58 The  criticisms  levelled  against  Moody's  leadership  moved him  to  respond  in  various  ways  to  ameliorate  and  threaten  to  resign  or dissolve the League. All these tactical moves helped. Both the League and Moody survived; indeed, he remained President until 1947.

Ladipo  Solanke,  leader  of  the  West  African  Students'  Union,  also wanted to unite Blacks everywhere. Clearly, at least for the first seven years of  the  League's  existence,  WASU  (given  its  radical  student  membership) was  one  of  the  League's  most  serious  rivals.  In  fact,  there  was  much hostility from nationalist organisations in West Africa to the League and its branches. WASU's credibility  was  reflected  in  the  fact  that,  for  a  time,  a fairly successful branch was set up in Sierra Leone.

Moody and Solanke,  unwilling  to  give  ground,  fought  for  the  'moral and financial' support of Blacks in Britain and the colonies. Their differences had become so entrenched that in May 1934, two representatives from the LCP and four from WASU met but failed to reach any agreement. 59 A major bone of contention between the two organisations was Aggrey House, a student hostel, set up by the Colonial Office and the missionary society. WASU proposed that the League should join its boycott of the hostel, stating that failure to agree on this point meant other matters would not be discussed.

In true accommodative fashion, the LCP was prepared 'to go more than half way to meet our sister organisation', but it could not accept the terms of the report. 60 While many  students opposed  Aggrey House  as a paternalistic  gesture  designed  to  monitor  and  control  their  movements, Moody  defended  it.  His  dream,  however,  was  the  establishment  of  a Cultural Centre run by the LCP. 61

The  dispute  over  Aggrey  House  was  a  turning  point  in  the  League's relationship  with  other  groups,  particularly  WASU.  Moody's  religious fervour and success in influencing those in high places, served to alienate

Blacks  who  distrusted  missionaries  and  officials.  In  the  face  of  the  real divide which separated him from so many Blacks, Moody, the 'Accommodative Leader' could do little to effect unity, precisely because he  was  'a  firm  believer  in  the  aristocratic  virtues  and  in  the  essential fairness  of  Britishers  with  breeding'.  Moreover,  he  had  great  faith  in Christianity.  In  the  mid-1930s,  he  tended  occasionally  to  mix  'absolute pacifism' with 'racial messianism'.

For his 'racialism', he received criticism not only from white Christians, but also from the Communists. The Negro Worker , an international monthly magazine,  attacked  the  League.  The  magazine  appealed  to  working  class Blacks  in  Britain  and  was  sold  in  left-wing  bookshops.  In  1931,  the Communist-affiliated, Negro Welfare Association was formed, establishing its headquarters in London. This 'specialised' organisation never acquired a 'mass base'. Indeed, it remained a small group of intellectuals and militant workers  before  it  petered  out  on  the  eve  of  the  Second  World  War.  The continuous propaganda churned out by the NWA and its affiliation with the international Communist  Movement,  brought  pressure  to  bear  on  the accommodative 'race leaders'. The NWA played an active part in organising many large 'Scottsboro' demonstrations in England. 62

Aware  of  the  differences  and  dissension  among  the  black  community leaders, one of the Association's goals was that all organisations should cooperate. Moreover, it attacked the Joint Council to Promote Understanding between  White  and  Coloured  People  in  Britain because  it  failed  to  view race relations in Britain within the imperialist context. The LCP was also taken  to  task  for  not  agitating  for  an  end  to  British  rule.  On  the Aggrey House issue, the NWA joined WASU in denouncing the 'Jim Crow' hostel. On the question of race prejudice in democratic England, The Negro Worker mounted  a  strong  attack  on  Quakers  and  other  pacifists  for  their  lack  of organisation  (among  rank  and  file  workers),  traditionalism  and  lack  of militancy.  Furthermore,  Moody  who  was  always  under  a  strong  Quaker influence,  although  a  Congregationalist,  was  referred  to  as  'Uncle  Tom Moody'. Stung by this jibe, he replied that communism was not the answer. 'We don't want to fight, we are pacifists - but we know what we want.' 63

Between 1929 and 1935 'opposing the colour bar' emerged as the major preoccupation of the various black associations and interested individuals.' 64

## The Cardiff Crisis of 1935 and its consequences

The Cardiff Crisis of 1935 was of major importance. In the face of racial discrimination on the part of the NUS and employers who refused to signon  black  seamen,  an ad  hoc committee  was  formed.  Consequently,  the Communist leader of the Colonial Defence Association was sent to London to seek the support of the LCP for their cause. 65

Already the LCP (under pressure from Communists and Marxists within its own ranks) had been, for two years, discussing the question of aid for the Cardiff  seamen  and  the  overall  condition  of  the  5000  black  people  there. The time had come for the League to act, and it did so with vigour. Apart from its investigative and lobby efforts, as an integral part of their activities, Moody tried to organise a branch in Cardiff, although he and his middleclass  organisation  were  far  removed  (geographically,  economically  and socially) from  the  local Blacks  in Cardiff. Nevertheless,  he  felt his leadership was necessary. Before the 'crisis' he stated that plans were being prepared  by  the  League  to  help  'our  coloured'  working  population,  in Cardiff and throughout the British Isles and would go a long way toward helping to solve the problem of the race. 66

Unfortunately  for  Moody  and  the  LCP,  the  local  leaders  were  not prepared  to  have  a  middle-class  London  organisation  in  control  of  'race relations' in Cardiff. More  emphasis  will  be placed on this crucial relationship between the rank and file workers and the LCP leadership later.

During  and  following  the  Cardiff  Crisis  of  1935  competition  and  cooperation involved individuals representing four main types of organisations: firstly, those with a Christian-humanitarian orientation, composed  mainly  of  white  leaders;  secondly,  those  with  a  Christianhumanitarian  orientation  controlled  by  black  leaders;  thirdly,  Communistinfluenced groups; and fourthly, Pan African groups.

Underlying  these  relationships  however,  even  when  they  were  cooperating, there was 'diffuse tension and latent antagonism'. 67

## Pan Africanism and the Marxists

Pan African sentiments were ever present within the various working class groups  in  Cardiff,  at  this  time.  Such  sentiments  appeared  in  their  most 'extreme'  form  in  the  United  States  in  the  1920s,  with  Marcus  Garvey's 'Back to Africa'  movement,  the  UNIA. 68   Following  the  UNIA's  collapse,

Garvey  was  jailed  in  1925  and  deported  back  to  Jamaica.  Interestingly, Garvey was anti-socialist. In fact, he emphasised the development of black capitalist enterprises. After entering politics in Jamaica, he came to England in  1934.  In  the  hope  of  re-establishing  the  movement,  he  published  a magazine  called The  Black  Man .  In  spite  of  Garvey's  efforts  his  London UNIA had little appeal for black seamen or students. When he died in 1940, there was no branch in existence.

Although Garvey's brand of Pan Africanism declined during the 1930s, Pan African sentiments had become an integral part of black organisations in Britain. One of the most important was a Marxist group led by George Padmore, then a young West Indian intellectual, who edited the Communist journal The Negro Worker . Padmore became disillusioned with the subordination of colonial revolutionary movements to the demands of the Soviet  Union.  Refusal  to  toe  this  line  led  to  his  expulsion  from  the Communist Party in 1935. That same year, when he arrived in London, he joined  forces  with  C.  L.  R.  James,  Ras  Makonnen  and  Jomo  Kenyatta, among  others. Later, they founded the IASB  and  the Pan  African Federation.  And  in  1938,  they  began  to  publish International  African Opinion .

Both  these  organisations  differed  from  the  Liberal-humanitarians  and the Communists. Their goal was the united action of all the organisations in the 'Pan African aggregate'. This meant Pan African solidarity to reinforce the nationalist movements in Africa and the West Indies. These radical Pan Africanists  attacked  the  LCP  'on  principle'.  Moody,  in  true  paternalist fashion, considered them to be 'young and misguided'. As it was, they were anything but misguided. He said, however, they served a useful purpose in raising black consciousness, and thus black protest.

Not surprisingly,  the  attackers  had  themselves  to  face  strong  criticism from the Communists who regarded them as 'renegades and Trotskyists'. 69 In  spite  of  attack  and  counter-attacks,  this  small  group  of  radical  Pan Africanists was in tune with the impatient colonial masses. In effect, they gave voice to Blacks in the Metropole and elsewhere in the Empire.

## The impact of the Second World War

Between the Cardiff Crisis of 1935 and the outbreak of the war, there was closer  co-operation  between  the  League,  a  'wide  segment'  of  the  British Labour  Movement,  and  the  Communist  Party  on  such  issues  as  Spain,

protest against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and racial discrimination in Britain. Significantly, also during this period, the LCP's Cardiff Branch was 'killed off by the opposition, on the one hand, of the Liberal-humanitarian forces and the Communists there, and on the other, by the 'apathy' of the people in the area. Given this position of stalemate there seemed little that anyone (certainly from outside, short of government intervention) could do to  improve  the  black  seamen's  status.  The  prospects  for  their  children seemed graver.

The  depression  of  the  1930s  had  the  effect  of  aggravating  an  already serious  problem  of  colonial  poverty,  disease  and  unemployment.  Not surprisingly, the cumulative effect of these tragedies accelerated the sense of  desperation  among  colonial  peoples.  By  1938,  the  acute  problems  of colonial  workers  led  to  serious  riots  in  the West  Indies, Africa  and  India. Indeed, many of the indigenous labour leaders were also nationalists. Their agitation for self-government (so that the dispossessed masses could at least have  control  of  their  problems)  reflected  the  essential  sentiments  of  Pan African  groups  in  Britain.  Thus,  the  colonial  'disturbances'  became  a rallying point from which the radical Pan Africanists could hammer home their primary demand of black nationalism.

The  League,  through  Moody,  seized  this  opportunity.  Through  its representations a Royal Commission was appointed, and Moody played a part in helping to set the Commission's terms of reference. 70  This was an important step towards achieving other Pan African objectives.

Gradually, the League grew in stature and influence. During the war, it emerged as the most important organisation in British race relations. During the  early  stages  of  the  war,  however,  there  were  important  differences between the LCP and the radical Pan Africanists and the Communists. The advice  given  to  Blacks  by  Pan  Africanists  and  Communists  was  not  to support  the  war  effort  because  they  did  not  have  full  democracy.  More precisely,  when  the  Soviets  were  attacked,  the  Communists  called  upon Blacks  and  colonials  everywhere  to  fight  against  Fascism.  On  the  other hand,  while  the  Pan African  group  gave  'half-hearted'  support  to  the  war effort, the LCP's support was 'whole-hearted'.

In 1943, the LCP had reached the peak of its influence and popularity. The League had also moved to new offices in central London. With its hardwon credibility, Moody the vigilant opportunist, was poised to exploit the war for the benefit of the League. He used a dual strategy, firstly employing

the  soft-soap  technique  of  appealing  to  the  Liberal-humanitarian  'sacred sanctions'; and secondly, by projecting Communism  as  the  dreaded alternative if reforms were not introduced. Moody used the circumstances of the war, for example, the fight against Hitler and Fascism, to highlight his fight against the colour bar. The good behaviour of the black American troops reinforced his arguments.

The war then, brought Pan African activity to a peak. The League had worked closely with a number of black leaders and organisations in spite of their ideological differences.

As the war drew to a close, the LCP concentrated on the problem of the illegitimate  children  of  black  American  soldiers.  When  Moody  died  in 1947, there was a struggle for control between the 'Christian-humanitarian' group  and  a  'more  aggressive'  group.  After  its  successful  Congress,  the radical Pan Africanists had a major influence over the controlling group for about  three  years,  before  the  League  disintegrated.  When  it  was  revived again in 1951, it functioned as a 'very feeble organisation'.

The Pan African Federation also declined. But, it  had  sowed  well  the seeds  of  black  nationalism  in  the  colonies.  During  1947  and  1948,  there were only about 12 organised associations among people of African descent in the London area. One of these groups, a pressure group representing the interests  of  the  black  working  class  (with  a  membership  of  less  than  100 members) was the ambitious Coloured Workers Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Among the other organisations were students' groups (WASU and the East African Students' Association) and a 'rather weak' Caribbean Club, The West African National Secretariat; and of course, the oldest and most influential was the LCP.

On reflection, then, between 1935 and the close of the war, all the major ideological and utopian organisations were concerned with race relations in Britain.  Indeed,  during  the  period  significant  changes  took  place  at  the demographic level. The presence of over 200,000 black American soldiers, and several thousand Africans and West Indians who had come to Britain, meant that more black people than ever before were brought into contact with the British public. 71 This was a rude awakening; a preamble of things to come, as Black and White in a 'world crisis' fought for democracy.

Cardiff's black leaders (1947-48)

During 1947 and 1948, there were three major black leaders in the Cardiff community.  They  were  'Larry'  (also  known  as  'left-wing  leader'),  a Guianese  over  60  years  old.  He  was  Chairman  of  the  Colonial  Defence Association. Jack (also known as Pan African leader), head of the Coloured International Athletic  Club,  was  also  over  60  years  old  and  from  Guiana. The third leader, 'Old Man Jacob' (alias 'Elder Statesman') was president of the United Committee of Coloured and Colonial Peoples Organisations, which was active in 1945 and 1946. A fourth leader, who had suffered a loss of influence was 'Nelson' (the 'Accommodative leader') from Sierra Leone. He  was  president  of  the  Sons  of  Africa. 72 Almost  'hounded  out'  of  the community  (he  lived  outside  Bute  Town),  he  regained  some  of  his  lost influence (though nowhere near enough) by running the Bute Town Social Welfare  Club  in  the  centre  of  the  black  community.  None  of  the  other leaders spoke to him. Each of these men's characters gave an insight as to their role, not as leaders, but as personalities.

Larry came to Cardiff in 1914. He did a 'shore job' during the war, but was basically a seaman who was proud of his affiliation to the Communist Party.  He  seemed obsessed with the 'corruption' of capitalists, the police, public officials, trade union bureaucrats, missionaries, social workers and a few  local  Arab  businessmen.  The  butt  of  many  of  his  jokes  was  the 'corruptness'  of  Islamic  religious  leaders.  A  fierce  protector  of  the  black working class, he was (as were most West Indians) suspicious of Arabs and their collusion with the Colonial Office. For his rivals, the Pan Africanists and  Trotskyites,  his  hatred  was  'uncompromising'.  He  was  particularly critical of Padmore, James and Makonnen. He tagged Padmore a 'Trotskyite', Makonnen, 'a plain racketeer' and James as one of that 'set of renegade Communists'.

Larry founded the Colonial Defence Association in 1927, and during the Crisis between 1927 and 1939, he had become the most popular, aggressive and  vocal  leader  in  the  community.  Later,  in  1947  and  1948,  the  CDA declined. Unfortunately, Larry never gave a full account of the number of dues-paying members in the CDA. Asked what he considered to be the most important  events  during  the  CDA's  existence,  Larry  noted:  the  fight  to restore the nationality of seamen in 1935 and 1936, deputations received by the  Lord  Mayor  protesting  against  differential  relief  allotments  in August 1937, and publicity by the BBC in a broadcast publicising the problems of the people of the Bay in March 1939. 73 According to Larry, the CDA had

never had any salaried officials and its membership fees were one shilling to join and four pence a week dues. He was proud of the several successful compensation claims that the Association made on behalf of its members. At the height of the Crisis, during the 1930s, Larry claimed that the CDA had  a  thousand  cases  on  file.  He  took  the  view  (and  given  the  trend  he seems to be correct) that people respond only when there is an issue that touches them such as the fight for benefits.

Larry's past leadership had brought him respect and admiration from his followers, even among those who resented his 'dogmatic air' and 'tendency to  lay  down  the  line  on  all  issues'.  His  commitment  on  behalf  of  the community was reflected in the number of times he had been arrested. This suffering for the cause elevated him to the status of 'Hero'. His prestige was such  that  although  the  CDA  was  inactive  in  1947  and  1948,  Larry  had around him about five or six men who remained loyal to the Party line.

The other  black  leader  from  Guiana,  Jack,  'The  Pan African  Leader', regarded himself essentially as a race-leader in the Marxist-socialist tradition.  Interestingly,  he  also  held  office  in  the  CDA  and  the  United Committee  of  Coloured  and  Colonial  People's  Organisations.  Formerly  a Communist,  but  still  a  Marxist,  as  one  of  the  officials  of  the  Coloured International Athletic Club (CIAC), he had achieved leadership status.

Occupationally,  Jack  was  involved  in  two  lines  of  business:  as  a salesman of newspapers and running an illegal 'bookie business'. Interestingly, while his illegal business devalued his leadership among some Blacks and all of the white middle-class leaders, it clearly did not weaken his standing among the rank and file in Bute Town. As far as the police was concerned,  Jack  was  cast  again  in  a  dual  role:  that  of  'agitator'  and  'law breaker'. Over the years he had been arrested on several occasions on both counts. Not surprisingly, therefore, he harboured a hatred and suspicion of the police. Few Blacks, certainly among the older men in 'The Bay', would disagree with Jack's hostility towards the police.

Jack's commitment as a Pan Africanist was clear. His intellectual hero was  George  Padmore. And  interestingly  (given  Larry's  antipathy  towards Padmore) Larry labelled Jack a 'Trotskyist'.

Then, there was, in the early 1940s, the Sons of Africa, an association of the Mutual Aid type, which had more than 400 dues-paying members. By 1947 the organisation had disintegrated. Nelson, the founder and president was  blamed. According  to  Nelson  the  club's  decline  began  in  1945.  The

demise of the Sons of Africa led Nelson to found the Bute Town Social and Welfare  Club  which  was  still  functioning  in  1948.  The  social  and  sports activity orientation proved attractive as the Pan African leader, Jack, found after the war when he based his CIAC on members interested in athletics. Nelson placed the emphasis on black youth, particularly the British-born. Music and dancing constituted an integral part of the club's activities.

Unlike  Larry  and  Jack,  Nelson  was  a  conservative,  accommodative leader. While Larry and Jack consistently opposed the colour bar in Britain, Nelson  felt,  'There  is  no  colour  bar  here.  There  is  colour  prejudice  in individuals, but there isn't any colour bar.' He added that although the other black leaders tended to blame the middle and upper classes for prejudice, 'It's only the ordinary people we see in the every day life that don't want us.' 74 Moreover,  Larry  and  Jack  favoured  government  action  to  fight  the colour bar. Nelson disagreed. He felt that the main trouble in The Bay was irresponsible leaders - the 'fools' as he called them.

The last  of  the  notable  community  leaders  during  the  period  was  Old Man  Jacob,  known  as  the  Elder  Statesman.  Unlike  the other black community leaders mentioned Old Man Jacob was a college graduate. In 1945, he had been the head of the United Committee of Coloured Peoples Organisations in Tiger Bay. But hope gave way to disillusionment. He said: 'This is a white man's country, and he may be ever so polite about it, but he lets you know it. No one wanted black engineers in the Valley. There was no colour bar in social intercourse - only some curiosity about the 'blackie' - but to handle important affairs that was different.' 75 To educated Blacks, this  expression  of  race  and  colour  prejudice  would  in  time  become  a recurring and major theme at the workplace.

From the vantage point of holding a number of official posts in every African and West Indian organisation in the community, he summed up the rise and fall of organisations in the Bay thus, 'It's mighty hard to get a host behind you in a place like this.' In 1945, he was the only leader to unite the community. He was chosen Chairman of the United Committee of Coloured and Colonial Peoples Organisations. Unfortunately, the UCCCPO declined. Commenting on this, the Elder Statesman echoed a well-known fact among the black leaders, 'when the pressure is off, we fall apart.'

In effect, the situation during 'normal' times in Tiger Bay was that most people were not members of any associations or in cliques. And leaders had

frequent interaction with each other. On the other hand, during 'crises' in Tiger  Bay,  people  came  together  'around  their  leaders'  and  were  more closely integrated with each other. 76

## The LCP's Cardiff branch

The  Cardiff  Crisis  of  1935  had  brought  together  a  number  of  interested groups, both black and white. Indeed, the local black seamen formed an ad hoc organisation, and the LCP activity supported the seamen. The intention was  that  the  League  should  exploit  the  crisis  by  organising  a  branch  in Cardiff; a deliberate ploy to use the Cardiff Crisis to begin a national fundraising campaign to help the League out of its financial difficulties. Caught in the middle, the black seamen were flanked on the other hand by another organisation  representing  the  local  white  Christian-humanitarian  group. Whatever  the  League's  motivation,  it  was  clear  that  none  of  the  local leaders, black or white, cared for LCP control of race relations in Cardiff. Thus,  the  local  groups  combined  to  get  rid  of  the  London-based  League. Both Larry and Jack took a strong line against the League's opportunism. Moreover, they were keen in competition with the London Square Mission for Coloureds.  This  was  an  on-going  struggle  and  when  the  League intervened Larry gave Moody his support. This gesture of black solidarity was  attacked  by  the  Mission  which  tried  to  weaken  the  newly-organised LCP  branch's  influence.  In  turn,  Larry's  supporters  attempted  to  get  the LCP  branch  leaders  against  the  Mission  and  the  meddling,  troublesome parson.

Moody was in an awkward position. In spite of his need to protect the new branch, as a prominent church leader, he could not pick a fight with the denomination  that  had  financed  the  Nancy  Sharpe  Report  on  the  black community. Surrounded by hostile forces, the new LCP branch leadership turned to the left-wing black leaders for advice.

Public officials were becoming increasingly active. Captain Evans, MP for Cardiff South wrote to the LCP Branch Secretary informing him that Sir John  Harris  of  the  Christian-humanitarian  Anti-Slavery  and  Aborigines Protection  Society  and  the  Africans  in  Europe  Welfare  Fund  was  due  to speak  on  behalf  of  the  seamen  at  the  local  Methodist  Church.  In  the  full knowledge that the black organisations were in need of funds, Evans stated that Sir John's intervention meant that money would be doled out to assist in any ameliorative work connected with the welfare of Blacks in England.

Why England when the Cardiff crisis had become a crying need? It seemed there  was  something  in  the  'Crisis'  for  everyone,  including  several  'very important Englishmen from London' who would 'share the platform'.

Eventually,  the  meeting  did  take  place  and  the  President  reported  to Moody that both Jack and the  Secretary  of  the  Cardiff  LCP  branch  were annoyed  over  the  meeting.  The  President  felt  it  was  a  generally  good meeting in spite of the fact that references made to the LCP were ignored. Non-committal  throughout,  he  ended  feebly,  'The  only  fault  with  the meeting  seems  to  be  the  ignoring  of  the  LCP.  Well,  I  don't  think  I  have more  to  say  except  that  instead  of  expressing  the  opinion  of  various members I have invited them to do so to you themselves, so expect to hear some  more.' 77 Thus,  the  President  had  done  his  bit  following  a  meeting which presented perhaps the greatest threat to the survival of the local LCP Branch.

The  two  black  leaders,  Larry  and  Jack,  participated  in  the  meeting. Generally,  they  were  concerned  with  asking  embarrassing  questions  and they  had  no  intention  of  defending  the  LCP.  More  precisely,  they  were interested  in  exposing  the  link  between  the  church  and  the  shipping interests.

Meanwhile,  a  Cardiff  case  that  was  being  fought  in  London  by  the Communist-affiliated League Against Imperialism moved Moody to get in touch again with the local LCP branch a week later. Following the inquiry as to why the local League branch had not fought the case, he appealed for information.  'I  have  heard  nothing  from  you  recently,'  he  wrote.  On  10 April  1936,  the  branch's  silence  was  broken  when  the  Secretary  wrote  to Moody: 'I am more than sorry that it (the LCP branch) should have gone phut because coloured folks in this town is (sic) in need of organisation and qualified  representation  badly.  But  you  know  better  than  I  do  that  you cannot help a man more than he is willing …' 78

The  inability  of  the  League  to  espouse  causes  that  the  local  black communities  (not  only  in  Cardiff,  but  also  in  London  and  Liverpool) considered  to  be  important  was  a  major  factor  in  the  League's  failure  to mobilise mass support. Here the class aspect of the organisation is clearly reflected. Moreover, the League's financial problems prevented the pursuit of  individual  cases  which,  if  won,  could  well  have  engendered  greater interest. Taken together, these factors, and the combined effect of

competition from the Mission and such leaders as Larry and Jack, put paid to  any  hopes  of  survival  for  the  Cardiff  LCP  branch.  Moreover,  in  time, Moody's 'moderate' approach would be tested as other more radical black groups came into being.

## The League and other black groups

Although during its earlier phase, ideological and philosophical differences separated  the  LCP  from  the  Negro  Workers' Association,  WASU  and  the IASB, on the  issue  of  the  working  class  disturbances  in  the  West  Indies, both Moody and Arthur Lewis showed a willingness to find common cause with other black groups in Britain. Indeed, a number of issues during the 1930s and 1940s led to agitation either jointly or in parallel action.

The  International  African  Service  Bureau  was  organised  in  the  mid1930s by George Padmore, C. L. R. James, Ras Makonnen, Jomo Kenyatta and I. T. A. Wallace. The relationship between the LCP and the IASB was regarded as one of convenience. 79 Although the LCP was recognised as a powerful organisation among Liberals, it had little effect on the IASB since the Bureau had already taken an independent course. The India League ran parallel  with  the  LCP  in  terms  of  its  influential  expatriate  Indian  nucleus which worked closely with Labour Party intellectuals.

The  IASB  emphasised  service  to  the  people  of  African  descent  on educational,  economic,  co-operative  and  political  matters.  Indeed,  the movement towards the founding of the Bureau was the direct result of the Ethiopian crisis. As the movement grew, a rota of Hyde Park Speakers was organised and experts were called in to give an address at one of the many meetings held by the Left. The IASB also published a journal, International African Opinion .

Both  Padmore  and  James  wrote  for  the  journal,  while  Makonnen concentrated on raising money for it. Makonnen was particularly resourceful selling the paper at Halls where leftist and peace meetings were held.  If  his  presence  and  activity  at  these  meetings  meant  embarrassment for the organisers, to him it meant pounds sterling.

Given  the  'convenience'  of  the  relationship,  the  radical  IASB,  led  an attack  on  the  LCP  obstructionists,  who  used  the  balm  of  aid,  and  garden parties  to  seduce  young  men.  WASU  was  also  more  outspoken  than  the

LCP,  providing  a  social  outlet  in  the  form  of  WASU  House,  'a  homely place'  where  one  could  always  get  a  groundnut  chop,  and  where  dances were  held  on  Saturday  nights.  By  comparison,  the  LCP  (now  financially better off) was much more of an administrative centre with two offices on St Andrews  Street,  near  Buckingham  Palace;  a  long  way  from  the  black communities!

An  important  issue  between  the  LCP  and  WASU  was  the  projected Aggrey House which reflected the more suspicious attitudes of WASU to the Colonial Office. About this time, Marcus Garvey was trying to make a come-back  on  the  English  scene,  having  been  expelled  from  the  United States  of  America.  WASU,  particularly  concerned  about  the  need  for  a hostel,  fortunately  received  the  assistance  they  needed.  Indeed  it  was Marcus Garvey 'who made the really generous gift to WASU. He gave that house of theirs  in  Camden Town, and of course this put a number of the more  conservative  members  in  a  difficult  position;  they  were  not  sure whether this rabble-rouser Garvey was an even more dangerous person to associate with than the Colonial Office.' 80 Ladipo Solanke and other more political members  of  the  WASU  Committee  recognised  this  debt  to Garvey. 81

Another black group which related to the LCP was the working class Colonial Seamen's Union. The Union's leader, Chris Jones worked closely with the militant IASB to persuade black seamen to join the union. There was  at  the  time  a  real  fear  among  white  trade  unionists  that  the  Blacks would  act  as  scabs.  This  was  understandable  since  the  victimised  Blacks received no support from the white unions.

The  black  seaman's  position  was  particularly  precarious  in  that  the Union was 'not really a union in the strict sense'. According to Makonnen, the IASB did not want a separate black union. Thus, the CSU functioned more on the lines of a welfare and propaganda grouping in order to bring the  colonial  seamen  together  so  that  they  would  be  persuaded  to  join  the white unions. The intention was to show the weaknesses of remaining ununionised. The  argument  was  that  by  not  joining  the  union  bosses  would always pay lower wages 'and this will separate you from your comrades'.

As leader of the 'Union' Chris Jones was the mouthpiece, representing any  grievances. Apart  from  connections  in  the  LCP  and  the  IASB,  Jones also  had  contacts  in  the  Labour  Party.  Clearly,  his  grass-roots  leadership

was crucial in engendering a sense of confidence among black seamen. On the  question  of  delayed  payment  of  black  seamen's  wages  from  Greek shippers, Jones played the important role of go-between. So impressed was Makonnen by his leadership that he wrote: 'he was looked on as a leader in the same way as some of the outstanding Irish dock leaders in New York.'

Political agitation and economic discontent in the West Indies provided common ground for inter-group co-operation. In particular, the widespread disturbances  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago  (beginning  earlier  with  the  1919 strikes and later with the oilfield 'riots' in 1937, and a series of strikes in Jamaica in 1938) led to united condemnation.

In addition to the LCP's statements, the IASB and the NWA also sent highly  critical  memoranda  to  the  Colonial  Office. 82 They  condemned  the conclusions of the Forster Report. Moreover, both the League and the IASB responded quickly to the strikes in Jamaica and the violence which involved the police and the military.

A further shift in the League's position brought it closer to militancy, as reflected in the radical content of a resolution passed at a meeting held at Memorial  Hall  in  London. 83 Moody  was  particularly  active  at  this  time lobbying  the  Colonial  Office  and  joining  a  deputation  to  see  Sir  Henry Moore.  In  response  to  the  combined  pressure  of  the  LCP,  IASB  and  the NWA,  the  government  appointed  the  Lord  Moyne  Royal  West  India Commission.  This  pressure  was  reinforced  by  the  influential  political, religious and humanitarian contacts of Moody and members of the IASB.

Once  the  Commission  was  set  up,  the  League  concentrated  on  its membership and noted that there was no announcement of any representative of labour on the Commission. One further observation was the 'very serious and significant omission from the terms of reference … of any  provision  for  enquiry  into  the  political  aspect  of  the  life  of  these territories'. 84 Moreover,  the  League's  militancy  was  seen  in  the  firm statement  that  only  when  economic  improvement  is  accompanied  by political freedom 'will the West Indies be freed from the stultification of all progress by those who at present controlling the political machinery prevent even the most elementary change in the lot of the West Indian people'. 85

Further,  the  League  in  conjunction  with  the  IASB  and  the  NWA submitted a joint memorandum to the Moyne Commission. The people on whose behalf these representations were made declared their appreciation,

when Alexander Bustamante (the Labour leader) telegraphed that 'tens of thousands organised Jamaican workers are standing firm behind you'. 86

This  shift  towards  militancy  in  the  League  continued.  When  the  war started,  the  League,  IASB  and  WASU  came  together  on  the  colour  bar issue,  especially  within  the  British Armed  Forces.  They  were  particularly concerned  that  black  citizens of the British Empire  were  not  given commissions as officers.

Significantly, the League had indicated that it could coexist with other groups, in spite of differences in philosophies and ideologies. So much so that  when  Marcus  Garvey  died,  the  LCP Newsletter paid  tribute  to  him, stating 'His work has not been in vain.' 87

During  the  war,  the  League  ceased  to  concern  itself  with  social activities.  From  the  publicity  it  had  received,  increased  support  for  the League came from the West Indian technicians and trainees who came to Britain, and from 'substantial numbers' of Blacks generally who enlisted in the  armed  forces.  Additionally,  there  was  a  massive  presence  of  black American troops.

The  League's next major concern was  discrimination within the Colonial Service. Arthur Lewis noted that 'the League of Coloured Peoples will not rest until this iniquitous system is ended.' 88 Agitation continued. In 1943,  the  League  had  reached  its  'high  water'  mark  of  influence  and effectiveness. As St Clair Drake put it, the League 'was the most important institutional increment in the action-structure oriented toward race relations on the eve of the Second World War', influencing public policy on a wide range of issues involving the West Indies and Africa. 89

Moreover,  by  1943  Moody's  personal  influence  had  grown.  He  was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the London Missionary Society. The League  had  grown  much  stronger  and  had  John  Carter  as  its  full-time Secretary;  and  in  1944,  instead  of  Moody's  home,  new  offices  were established  at  21  Old  Queen  Street  near  St  James's  Park  Underground Station. Most gratifying to Moody was the setting up of two Commissions namely, the Asquith, concerning the development of higher education in the colonies, and the Elliot, to consider the development of Universities in West Africa which included three West Africans in its membership of twelve.

In July 1944 the League convened a conference to draw up a 'charter for  the  League  of  Coloured  Peoples'. Among  its  participants  were Arthur

Creech-Jones. A  year  later,  the  radical  Pan  Africanists  (Padmore,  James, Makonnen and Kenyatta among others) called the historic Fifth Pan African Congress in Manchester. The wide publicity given to the 'Charter' 90 and the arrival of substantial numbers of Africans and West Indians in London, as a direct consequence of the war, moved Moody to find a way of establishing a Colonial Cultural Centre. In spite of his best efforts to raise £50,000, this ambition was never realised.

When  Moody  died  'a  struggle  for  control  broke  out  between  the Christian  humanitarian  group  and  a  more  aggressive  group.  The  Pan African  radicals  exerted  great  influence  on  the  group  for  three  years  and then  the  League  disintegrated,  to  be  revived  in  1951  as  a  very  feeble organisation.' 91 In retrospect this was inevitable for the radical Pan African Federation (incorporating the leaders of the IASB) had grasped the nettle of the post-war colonial situation.

With  Moody's  death  in  1947,  a  'unique'  organisation  and  personality were lost. In one fundamental respect, Moody and Garvey (both Jamaicans) shared a firm belief in the upliftment of the black race. Although Garvey was  a  charismatic  leader,  Moody  was  not.  As  Sam  Morris,  General Secretary  of  the  LCP  from  1945  to  1953  (with  a  short  break),  put  it,  'If Marcus Garvey could be called a visionary, which he was, the name could no  less  be  applied  to  Dr  Moody.'  Indeed,  both  men  possessed  magnetic qualities.  Following  Moody's  death,  many  League  members  continued  to pay  their  subscription,  'not  because  they  were  all  that  interested  in  the League, but because they liked and respected Dr Moody'. In time, this was proven:  the  membership  fell,  enthusiasm  flagged,  and  eventually  the organisation petered out about 1954-55. 92

## Pan Africanists in the twentieth century

Following Celestine Edwards, J. A. Thorne and H. Silvester Williams were the Pan Africanists Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Duse Mohammed Ali and J. R. Archer. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was the son of a medical student from Sierra  Leone  and  a  white  woman.  He  was  taken  care  of  and  raised  by  a white family in Croydon, when his father returned to Africa.

His exceptional gifts as a musician and composer made him famous. By 1900, he was brought into contact with not only cultured but also politically

conscious Blacks. Indeed, he participated in the Pan African Conference in 1900, and was also a member of the Pan African Association. J. R. Archer was also a member of this body.

On his concert  tours  of  the  USA  in  1904,  1906  and  1910,  ColeridgeTaylor  became  more  acquainted  with  the  persecution  and  oppression  of Blacks.  He  valued  highly  the  achievements  of  Blacks.  Moreover,  he  was politically  committed  to  black  self-determination  and  freedom.  He  sided with DuBois's more militant Niagara Movement 93  as opposed to Booker T. Washington's willingness to accept the American racial bias.

Duse  Mohammed Ali,  like  Sylvester  Williams,  also  met  (and  at  least initially)  was  impressed  by  the  Indian  Member  of  Parliament,  Dadabhai Naoroji. Apart from his work on Pan Africanism, he also knew Garvey and worked for the Universal Negro Improvement Association.

Ali was born in Alexandra in 1866 and lived in England between 1883 and 1921. Between 1882 and 1909, he worked as an actor and journalist, and  travelled  widely  to  the  USA,  the  Caribbean,  South  America,  West Africa and, of course, to his native Egypt. 94

While working as a journalist, he became aware of the Indian nationalist Naoroji. In fact, he was glad to meet the first 'coloured' man to be elected to the British House of Commons. As it was, when Naoroji first contested a Parliamentary seat in Holborn in 1886, colour consciousness was evident.

During a period of growing curiosity and questioning of the position of Blacks  in  Britain  and  elsewhere,  Ali,  on  his  doctor's  advice,  sought  to regain  good  health  in  a  warmer  climate.  He  travelled  to  South  America, visiting  Port-of-Spain, Trinidad,  where  he  met  members  of  the  'coloured' middle class, among whom was a group of lawyers. Given that Sylvester Williams was in Trinidad at the time, one might well speculate on a meeting between the man who organised the first Pan African Conference and the African who would later make an important contribution to the development of Pan Africanism.

When the multi-talented Ali returned to Britain, he showed a determination to settle down. He set up in business as a literary agent off Shaftesbury Avenue, London. Gradually, his work as a Pan Africanist took precedence over his theatrical interests. His journalism brought him to the attention of men of influence such as A. R. Orage, editor of the prestigious New Age .  By  then, Ali's  writings  had  already  appeared  alongside  famous

men, and those who were to become so, namely G. B. Shaw, H. G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc and Ezra Pound.

His interest in launching the African Times and Orient Review led him to appeal not only to successful black businessmen, but also to G. B. Shaw, a 'patron of the New Age'. Increasingly, Ali's articles were concerned with the questions of race and colour. He attacked Edwardian racism. Moreover, he sharply criticised British political, religious and social life. 95

An important event in Ali's life was the Universal Races Congress held in London (1911) which symbolised and instilled in him a firm belief that something could and must be done for the black masses. It is this vision that spurred him on to launch his greatest achievements, the African Times and Orient Review and the African and Orient Review published between 1912 and 1920. These reviews, printed in the heart of the Empire, and circulated internationally, had a major influence on the black intelligentsia in Africa, North America and the Caribbean. In spite of financial troubles, the quality of  these  publications  was  'persistently  extremely  high'.  Their  columns supported colonial nationalism and attacked imperialism and racism. Underpinning these themes was the significant call for Afro-Asian solidarity, and more precisely, black economic solidarity or 'economic Pan Africanism'. 96

Moreover,  these  magazines  drew  attention  to Ali's  Fleet  Street  office where many Blacks met in London. It was here in 1912-16 that the young Marcus Garvey had met Duse Mohammed Ali and became conversant with black  politics. 97 The  major  achievement  of  Ali  was  that  in  the  face  of difficulties he had over many years, consistently, through his African Times and Orient Review and African and Orient Review , brought black men and ideas together with far-reaching consequences in developing Pan Africanism and an international black consciousness.

- J. R. Archer was Ali's contemporary, although there is no record of any contact  between  the  two  men. Archer  had  attended  the  1900  Pan African Conference  and,  having  served  as  a  Labour  councillor,  was  elected  as  a London borough mayor in 1913. Archer's career reached its apogee when he  became  first  President  of  the  London-based  Pan  African  Group,  the African Progress Union, in December 1918.

Archer attended both the 1919 and 1921 Pan African Congresses. At the second Congress, he introduced the radical Indian, Shapurji Saklatvala, who

later became the Communist MP for North Battersea. Clearly, Archer who chaired a session of the Congress was involved at a high level in the formal Pan  African movement.  Following  his resignation as Chairman  and President of the APU, Archer was succeeded by Dr Alcindor. 98 Significantly,  thereafter,  Ali  became  one  of  the  members  of  the  new Committee. It is no wonder that Archer and Ali did not get on together, for with Archer's departure, the APU's policy had changed and Ali's economic Pan  Africanism  took  precedence  over  the  Archer-DuBois  emphasis  on political Pan Africanism, 99 at least, in the British context.

By the early 1920s, however, Pan Africanism seemed to have declined and so too did the APU. Up to this point, with few exceptions (if any) it seemed that the Pan Africanists were prepared to work within the imperial framework. Inevitably, as depression set in and the Abyssinian War stirred black militancy, the later 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were to witness a radical change in thinking among Pan Africanists in Britain. This shift in thinking from  the  late  nineteenth  to  the  early  twentieth  century  was  decisive, particularly after the Second World War.

In Britain, while the League of Coloured Peoples had made representations on behalf of black seamen in Cardiff and Liverpool, through the persistent efforts of DuBois, the first Pan African Congress was held in Paris in 1919. 100 Indeed, DuBois was instrumental in planning the first four Congresses,  and  had  a  profound  influence  (through  his  writings)  on  the black movements in Africa, the USA and the West Indies.

Before the fourth PAC was held in 1927, Garvey's Black Zionism had collapsed.  Ideologically,  DuBois  and  Garvey  were  diametrically  opposed. Pan  Africanism,  DuBois  style,  differed  from  Garveyism  in  that  'it  was never  conceived  as  a  Back  to Africa  Movement,  but  rather  as  a  dynamic political  philosophy  and  guide  to  action  for Africans  in Africa  who  were laying  the  foundations  of  national  liberation  organisations'. 101 Another source  of  conflict  between  the  two  men  was  the  concept  each  had  of political philosophies and economic systems. DuBois was against Garvey's Back to Africa movement. Indeed, he opposed transportation of American Blacks  back  to  Africa,  but  was  strongly  in  favour  of  complete  selfgovernment  for  Africans  in  Africa  organised  on  the  basis  of  socialism. Thus, national self-determination, individual liberty and democratic socialism  were  the  essential  elements  of  the  Pan  Africanism  of  DuBois,

while  his  influence  was  exercised  largely  through  his  writings  and  in  the classroom, as a teacher of economics and social history. On the other hand, Garvey, the agitator and organiser had generated mass appeal as an orator. In  spite  of  these  differences,  both  Garvey's  and  DuBois's  Pan Africanism had  become  well-known  in  Africa  and  among  Blacks  in  the  diaspora. However, while Garvey's Back to Africa movement had a meteoric rise and decline,  DuBois  was  at  the  centre  of  the  planning  of  the  first  four Congresses. Garvey had appealed to the black man's emotions, DuBois to his  intellect.  Indeed,  at  this  time,  many  British  intellectuals  sympathised with Pan Africanism. When the Third PAC met in London in 1923, Lord Olivier,  Professor  Harold  Laski  and  H.  G. Wells,  were  among  the  British Socialists  to  address  the  Congress. 102 Moreover,  J.  Ramsay  MacDonald, Chairman of the Labour Party sent his greetings to the Congress. 'Anything I can do to advance the cause of your people on your recommendations', he wrote to DuBois. 'I shall always do gladly.' 103 Unfortunately, the Africans' great  expectations  of  MacDonald  and  of  impending  improvements,  were not fulfilled. It was  clear, however,  that these gestures of goodwill symbolised recognition of the black man's cause.

What was restated at the  fourth  PAC  was  the  right  of Africans  in  the diaspora  to  be  governed  under  the  elective  principle,  thus  giving  them  a voice in government. Indeed, this had been one of the basic demands of the PAC. Significantly, at this Congress representatives of women's organisations constituted the majority of the American delegates. Thereafter, as economic depression engulfed the United States of America, with  devastating  effects  throughout  the  West  Indies,  Africa  and  Asia, Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia engendered greater interest among Africans  in  international  affairs.  Following  Mussolini's  act  of  aggression against  Abyssinia,  the  International  African  Friends  of  Abyssinia  (IAFA) came into being with the central purpose of arousing sympathy and support for the victims of fascism.

Predictably, the Ethiopian war rankled deeply among Africans. Cynicism  towards  the  great  powers  was  aroused  among  black  peoples everywhere. Africans felt they could not rely on Europeans for protection; they had to protect themselves from further aggression.

The  failure  of  the  League  of  Nations  to  respond  to  the  Ethiopian Emperor's appeal for help put the onus on Pan Africanists to renew their

efforts at Pan African organisation. Consequently, the International African Friends of Abyssinia Society joined forces in 1937 with others such as T. R. Makonnen  to  form  the  International  African  Service  Bureau.  The  chief officers of the Bureau were George Padmore, Chairman; Wallace Johnson, General Secretary (also a major West African trade unionist); Chris Jones, Organising  Secretary; C. L. R. James,  Editorial Director; and  Jomo Kenyatta,  Assistant  Secretary.  Makonnen  who  was  Honorary  Treasurer helped to launch the International African Opinion and was also responsible (through  his  business  dealings  as  a  restauranteur)  for  raising  most  of  the funds  in  making  possible  the  Fifth  Pan  African  Congress.  Moreover, Makonnen  established the journal Pan  Africa which constituted the 'principal  medium'  in  furtherance  of  the  ideology  of  Pan  Africanism throughout the black world.

The  years  before  the  outbreak  of  the  Second  World  War  were  most stimulating and constructive in the history of Pan Africanism. In fact, there was  a  growing  tide  of  anti-fascist  feeling.  This  posed  an  ideological challenge  to  the  Pan  African  Congress  of  1945.  It  had  to  meet  the communist  opportunists,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  racist  doctrines  and fascists,  on  the  other.  Moreover,  it  had  to  defend  the  principles  of  Pan Africanism, encapsulated in the fundamental right of black men to be free and independent of those who supported acceptance of the status quo in the interest of power politics.

Coincident with this period, was the emergence of African personalities in colonial nationalist movements. These intellectuals studied and evaluated the  prevailing  doctrines  (liberalism,  socialism,  communism,  anarchism, imperialism,  fascism)  as  they  related  to  the  cause  of  Pan  Africanism. Through  this process, upon  the foundation laid by DuBois  and  his predecessors,  these  leaders  forged  a  programme  of  dynamic  nationalism, constituting 'African traditional forms of organisation with Western political party methods'. 104

By the time of  the  Fifth  Pan African  Congress  held  in  Manchester  in 1945, although DuBois (the 'father' of Pan Africanism) was in the Chair, it was  the  radicals  (Padmore,  James,  Makonnen,  Nkrumah,  Kenyatta,  and Wallace  Johnson,  among  others)  of  the  Pan African  Federation  who  took charge  of  the  Congress.  By  then,  it  had  become  clear  that  a  new  path  to black nationalism was the adoption of an anti-imperialist line. We turn now

to the men and ideas that came together, after the First World War, to assist the development of a black radical ideology.

## 6 The Development of a Black Radical Ideology

## The black intelligentsia in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s

Socialist movements  and  socialist  thought  in  Britain  during  the  late eighteenth and throughout the nineteenth centuries have helped to consolidate  the  English  working  class  and  prepare  them  for  electoral politics in the twentieth century. Increasingly, the British working class had, during the 1920s and 1930s developed strong trade union links.

Marxism,  having  found  expression  in  the  1917  Revolution  in  Russia through Marxist-Leninism, found more ready acceptance among  the English middle-class and upper class liberals and socialists than among the English  working  class.  Class  cleavages  (and  a  native  distrust  of  foreign ideas  and  workers),  deeply  ingrained  in  English  social  values,  prevented widespread working class acceptance of the British Communist movement.

By about 1930, however, British Marxism and British socialism became strong influences in Labour Party and Independent Labour Party politics. In spite  of  these  seemingly  liberal  influences,  entry  of  black Africans,  West Indians  and  Asians  into  Britain  was  difficult.  Indeed,  more  so  than  the

access afforded by France to black French subjects. Thus, many of the black 'ideologues, theorists and activists' who arrived in Britain did so indirectly. For  example,  George  Padmore, Azikiwe,  Nkrumah  and  P.  K.  I.  Seme  of South Africa came to Britain from the United States of America, and Ras Makonnen came via Denmark. 1

If 'reds' were  feared, Blacks who  ventured  outside the colonial elementary school-based education system for higher education and training in  the  Metropole  were  particularly  marked. As  it  was,  most  of  those  who found their way to Britain during this period were from the colonial middle classes. This  included  many  of  the  Pan  Africanists  such  as  Thorne, Sylvester Williams, Duse Ali, Moody, Padmore, Makonnen and James who were among those committed to black politics in Britain.

By  1931,  this  black  intelligentsia  had  achieved  much.  Duse  Ali  had established  his  influential African  Times  and  Orient  Review (with  which Garvey was connected before setting-up his UNIA) and Makonnen had set up  the  Pan  African  Publishing  Company.  Moreover,  between  1900  and 1931,  five  social  and  political  organisations  were  formed:  the  Afro-West Indian Literary Society, the Ethiopian Progressive Association, the Union of Students of African Descent, WASU and the League of Coloured Peoples. Taken together, this initiative prepared them for the events of the 1930s. 2

Of this group, Padmore was involved with the Third International, until 1933; James was 'the most active' black Trotskyist; R. Palme Dutt was the leading  theorist  in  the  Communist  Party  of  Great  Britain  (CPGB).  This black  nucleus  had  left-wing  support  from William  Gallagher  (Communist MP), Fenner Brockway, Reginald Reynolds and Reginald Sorensen of the ILP.

Although  these  Blacks  were  committed  to  the  broad  Left,  the  Third International's disbanding  of  the  International  Trade  Union  of  Negro Workers in 1933 and the Soviet Union's trade in war materials with Italy during the Italian-Ethiopian War brought about serious questioning of their alignment with European Communists. Thus, the black ideologues accepted Pan  Africanism  while  retaining  a  Marxist  approach  in  their  critique  of capitalism and imperialism.

For most of these two decades, the black intelligentsia (who viewed the problem in global terms) intervened on behalf of black workers in Britain and in the colonies. For example, the doctors, barristers and one restaurant

and club-owner, among  them,  provided essential social welfare and professional  services  for  the  black  and  white  working  classes  in  the 'industrial ghettoes'. The intellectuals were aware that these services were being rendered at 'the centre of gravity'. Within the Empire, as this black middle-class  elite  saw  it,  there  were  'two  Englands  -  the  England  of  the colonies and that of the Metropolis'. 3

It was clear that among this black intelligentsia only a few had come for 'larger  political  purposes',  such  as  Makonnen  and  Padmore.  Earlier,  H. Sylvester  Williams  and  later,  C.  L.  R.  James  both  acquired  their  politics while in Britain. These men formed the nucleus 'of that generation of black intellectuals'  who  had  focused  attention  on  Britain.  Their  goals  were decolonisation and black liberation.

Makonnen, with Padmore, was one of the central organisers of the Fifth Pan African Congress held in Manchester in 1945, which brought together DuBois,  Padmore  and  Nkrumah,  the  last  time  they  met  as  'ideologues without power'. Having set up a publishing house which he registered as the Pan African Publishing Company Limited, Makonnen first published a pamphlet by Jomo Kenyatta and later one by Eric Williams, The Negro in the  Caribbean .  He  also  started  a  bookshop  called  the  'Economist'  which catered  for  Manchester  University  students.  While  this  was  not  a  'race bookshop'  Makonnen  sent  many  Oxford  University  Press  publications  to African  countries.  Books  about  Blacks  were  given  a  'big  push'.  For instance,  Kenneth  Little's Negroes  in  Britain , George  Padmore's How Britain Rules Africa and Eric Williams's Capitalism and Slavery . 4

Makonnen  who  came  to  Britain  in  1935  was  aware  of  the  debt  that colonial radicals owed to the radical traditions of the English working class, namely  free  speech  and  a  free  press.  Whether  or  not  he  understood  that these traditions were established by artisans and working classes during the late  eighteenth  and  early  nineteenth  centuries,  he  was  clear  about  the benefits accruing to black radicals such as himself.

James's  English  public-school  upbringing  in  Trinidad  led  to  his  two obsessions of cricket and English literature which, as he later discovered, were  expressions  of  the  same  social  order. As  a  developing  Marxist,  the conjunction (and relationship) of culture, class power  and  economic dominance, as he put it, 'hit me as it would have hit few of the students of society and culture in the international organisation to which I belonged'. 5

Put simply, James understood the relationship between politics and organised games. 6

Whatever were James's preconceptions of English society, his arrival in the  early  1930s  brought  him  face  to  face  with  reality.  For  one  thing,  the English working classes 'had become detached from identifications with the ruling class. English workers were militantly unpersuaded that their future and that of the ruling classes were identical'. Indeed, they would no longer fight imperialist wars. According to Cedric Robinson:

And despite the repeated betrayals of the leaderships of the Labour Party  and  the  trade  union  movement,  the  material  crises  of  world capital and the political incompetence of the ruling classes provided a  basis  for  a  certain  integrity  in  the  working  class  movement. The Labour  Party  in  disgrace  in  1931,  once  again  received  massive support (8½ million votes) from the labouring classes in 1935. The organised  Left,  however,  was  not  to  be  a  beneficiary.  The  CPGB, never  a  mass  party  in  any  sense,  was  further  weakened  by  the Comintern, directly and indirectly. 7

Given  a  left  wing  in  disarray,  according  to  James,  the  radical  black intelligentsia was forced to liberate itself by its own means. Padmore and Makonnen disagreed with  this  view. This  difference  of  opinion  provoked new ideas and new writings. Padmore wrote How Russia Transformed Her Colonial  Empire ,  Eric  Williams, The  Negro  in  the  Caribbean ,  Kenyatta, Kenya -  Land of Conflict ,  and  James, The Black Jacobins .  The first three were  Pan  Africanist  proposals  for  national  independence,  while  James's book,  'a  declaration  of  war  for  liberation',  also  dismissed  'the  need  for trusteeship of either the left or the right'.

Before the 1945 Pan  African Congress, Padmore  had made  an ideological  shift  from  Communism  and  the  'Negro'  to  Pan  Africanism. 8 Garvey's Back to Africa movement in the 1920s received enough support in the  United  States  to  be  able  to  resist  Communist  infiltration.  In  their frustration,  the  Communists  conceived  the  idea  of  a  'Black  Republic'. Padmore saw this 'fantastic scheme' as a cohesive force which could bring together disparate elements within Garvey's movement. 9

By  1930,  Padmore  was  at  the  forefront  of  international  Communist activity. His role was the supervision of the black diaspora. More precisely, he  was  not  only  responsible  for  the  recruitment  of  young  colonials  to Moscow,  but  also  gained  election  to  the  Moscow  Soviet,  participated  in party  work  in  Africa  and  had  been  on  the  reviewing  stand  with  Stalin. Given  this  commitment,  he  was  opposed  to  Garveyism,  Pan Africanism, national  reformism  and  trade  union  reformism. 10 In  effect,  this  meant opposition to DuBois and Garvey, among others.

Padmore was now faced with the major dilemma in the political thought of the colonial intelligentsia. As one commentator observed, 'Padmore had thus begun to rethink the classical theories of Marxism on the problem of working  class  solidarity. He  had  already  begun  to  rebuke  Profintern supporters  and  sections  of  the  'white'  working  class  for  their  failure  to recognise the specificity of the negro problem.' Garveyism, he felt, was the major battle facing Negro workers in America and in the African and West Indian  colonies.  Moreover,  DuBois  and  his  followers  were  dismissed  as 'office-seekers'  and  demagogues'.  In  sum,  Padmore  saw  the  African  as suffering from a major disability in terms of class and race. 11

Given that the failure of the black intelligentsia was, in part, the failure of  Marxism to accommodate the problem of minorities, it is clear that in Marx's writings, 'a separate theory on minorities would have constituted a serious breach with the basic postulate of the primacy of economic factors on the consciousness of man and its concomitant of the 'class' struggle as the motivating factor in history'. 12

Since Marx stated, 'White labour can never be free while black labour is enslaved', Marxists have been unable successfully to integrate 'race' with 'class'. Eventually, the competing issues of 'nationalism' and 'class' led to Padmore's break with the Soviet Union in June 1934, and the beginning of his career as a Pan Africanist. He chose this course rather than accept the call 'to endorse the new diplomatic policy of the Soviet Government, but to put  a  break  upon  the  anti-imperialist  work  of  its  affiliate  sections  and thereby  sacrifice  the  young  national  liberation  movements  in  Asia  and Africa'. 13

The years immediately preceding the outbreak of the Second World War coincided  with  what  was  known  on  the  Left  as  the  'anti-Fascist  Popular Front Period'. According to Padmore,

This period was one of the most stimulating and constructive in the history  of  Pan Africanism.  It  was  then  that  Pan Africanism  had  to meet the ideological challenge from the Communist opportunists on the  one  hand and the racist doctrines of the Fascists, on the other, and  to  defend  the  programme  of  Pan  Africanism  -  namely,  the fundamental right of black men to be free and independent and not be humbugged by those who preached acceptance of the status quo in the interest of power politics.

By the end of the 1930s, after two decades of thought and activity in Britain, the black intelligentsia was poised to take their slowly crystallising ideas of education, organisation and involvement of the masses back to the colonies.  But,  in  order  to  do  this  they  had  to  raise  the  level  of  black consciousness. This  they  attempted  to  do  during  the  1930s  and  1940s.  In fact,  these  decades  constituted  an  important  transitional  period  when  the mood  of  the  small  black  community  moved  from  a  large  measure  of grudging  acceptance  to  rising  consciousness  and  radicalism.  An  integral part  of  this  process  of  a  heightened  awareness  was  the  role  of  London's black press. Among the more important publications were WASU, the Negro Worker, The Keys, The Black Man, The African Sentinel and International African Opinion ,  the LCP's Newsletter, The New Times &amp; Ethiopian News (edited by the Pankhursts) and Pan Africa . 14

This  body  of  writing,  broadly  circulated  during  this  20-year  period, helped to create new attitudes and approaches in the postwar world. Black radicalism  was  in  the  ascendant.  Moreover,  heightened  awareness  of national  identity  clarified  the  fact  that  political  freedom  was  not  enough; economic self-sufficiency was also of primary concern. Furthermore, from this composite  of  approaches  (reflecting  a  multiplicity  of  views)  was crystallised the urgent need to 'educate, organise and involve the masses' towards  achieving  the  ultimate  goal  of self-government  and  national independence.  Freedom  from  colonial  domination  was  the  major  theme. Two of the chief advocates of achieving this goal were Shapurji Saklatvala (the  Indian  nationalist  and  Communist)  and  the  black  radical  George Padmore. First we turn to Indian nationalism and the Home Rule League advocates, particularly Joseph Baptista.

## Indian nationalism

Joseph Baptista: 'father' of the home rule movement in India

Since Raja Rammohun Roy's representations in the nineteenth century there has  been  a  list  of  outstanding  Indians  who  helped  to  engender  a  growing nationalism  among  the  Indian  people.  Among  them  were  Phirozeshah Mehta,  Dadabhai  Naoroji,  Gokhale,  Tilak,  Lala  Lajpatrai,  Surendranath Mbanerji and Shrinivas Shastri Jayakar, who preceded the later champions (Gandhi and Nehru) of Indian nationalism.

Among the  outstanding  men  who  worked  towards  self-government  is the  comparatively  less  well-known  Joseph  Baptista  now  recognised  by some as the 'Father' of the Home Rule Movement in India. Baptista was the link  both  between  different  levels  of  leadership  and  between  India  and England.

The  educated  Indian  elite  which  had  remained  aloof  during  the  1857 mutiny  had  ambiguous  feelings  about  British  rule  in  India.  By  1870, however,  the year of 'famines and  agrarian unrest, trouble between landlords and tenants, between workers and moneylenders', 15 the nationalists criticised the government's failure to reduce wasteful expenditure  and  for  not  acting  to  restore  the  equilibrium  of  the  rural population of India. By contrast, this was a time of literary and intellectual activity  which  helped  to  engender  higher  aspirations  in  the  succeeding generation.

In  the  1870s,  Baptista  belonged  to  a  group  of  people  known  as  the 'angry  young  men'. Among this group of middle-class agitators  were  the 'Moderates'  and  the  'Extremists'.  Their  differences  were  fundamental  in aim and methods. 16 The 'Moderates' claimed social equality and participation  in  the  British  government  in  India,  placing  their  reliance  on English history and English political ideas. They emphasised the need for political apprenticeship under British rule. On the other hand, the 'Extremists'  demanded  social  equality  and  political  emancipation  as  a fundamental  right.  They  rejected  England's  mission  in  India,  and  the constitutional  agitation  of  the  Moderates,  and  stressed  apprenticeship  as being an acceptance of the end of political servitude. Indeed, they called for self-reliance and self-apprenticeship through Swadeshi , boycott and passive resistance. 17

In  1914,  the  Indian  National  Congress  passed  a  resolution  calling  for 'measures as may be necessary for the recognition of India as a component part  of  the  Federated  Empire  in  the  full  and  free  enjoyment  of  the  rights belonging to that status'. Further, speakers and writers helped to spread the message of the liberation movements in the West, for example, the Home Rule  Movement  of  Ireland  and  the  movement  of  Italian  unification  and freedom.  In  June  of  that  same  year,  Tilak  was  released  (after  being incarcerated by the British authorities) and with Baptista's help made efforts to start a mass Home Rule agitation. Tilak's three-point programme was (i) the  Congress compromise; (ii) the reorganisation of the Nationalist Party; and (iii)  the  setting  afoot  of  a  strong  agitation  for  Home  Rule. 18 Baptista proved  to  be  an  able  co-ordinator.  Under  his  presidentship,  nationalists attended a conference in Poona which demanded Home Rule. Consequently,  the  Home  Rule  League  Headquarters  was  established  at Poona.

Both Tilak  (at  that  time  60  years  old)  and  Baptista  started  the  Home Rule League on 23 April 1916, six months before Mrs Annie Besant started hers. Mrs Besant was a tireless worker in support of Indian nationalism. At the  Indian  National  Congress  session  in  1915,  she  had  tried  to  get  the support of the Congress to form her own Home Rule League. In this, she met resistance from Bannerjea who argued that formation of a Home Rule League would 'overlap and weaken the Congress'. A year later, militancy for  Home  Rule  had  increased. At  the  Lucknow  Congress  the  Extremists, Tilak,  Gandhiji,  Mrs  Besant  and  Bipin  Chandra  Pal  won  control  of  the Congress from the Moderates. Tilak voiced the Congress demand 'for India to be a self-governing Dominion in which Indians would have control over the Central Legislative Council and complete Indian control over all matters in the provincial governments'. 19

Significantly,  while  Baptista  and  Besant  were  engaged  in  setting  up their Home Rule Leagues, Gandhi hoped to establish a new socio-economic order in India based on truth and love; a saint-like approach envisaging 'the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth'. In fact, as far as the Home Rulers  were  concerned,  the  atmosphere,  generated  in  the  country  by  the non-violent  movement  launched  by  Gandhi  was  most  unfavourable  to them. 20

Against this background then, Joseph Baptista, (later known as 'Kaka' uncle)  became  one  of  the  foremost  advocates  of  the  Indian  Home  Rule Movement.  He  was  born  on  17  March  1864  in  Bombay's  East  Indian community. He was educated at Bombay and Cambridge Universities, and had taken part in politics in England since 1895. After being called to the bar at Gray's Inn and enrolling as an advocate of the High Court at Bombay in 1899, he became Professor at the Government Law School in Bombay.

On  his  return  to  India  in  1899,  he  quickly  realised  the  political stagnation  in  Bombay  and  gravitated  towards  Sir  Phirozeshah  Mehta  and Tilak.  He  was  particularly  drawn  to  Tilak.  According  to  his  biographer, Baptista  may  be  claimed  to  have  been  the  first  Home  Rule  advocate  in India. In 1900, he suggested to Tilak that a Home Rule League should be formed. Tilak felt the idea was too premature. Both men met again in 1906 at  the  Congress  in  Calcutta.  In  1908, Tilak  was  imprisoned  for  six  years, and  in 1909,  the Morley-Minto  Reforms  were  introduced.  After  the outbreak  of  war  in  1914,  a  series  of  events  stimulated  the  dormant  and latent nationalism of India. Immediately Tilak was released from prison in 1915, he called a Provincial conference at Poona. Baptista was invited to preside  and  took  this  opportunity  to  suggest  again  the  establishment  of  a Home Rule League. This time Tilak agreed, but added, 'Yes, but would it be right to raise the issue of Home Rule now while the war is raging?' Finally, in 1916, the Home  Rule  League  was  inaugurated at the Belgaum Conference, and became the first such body to be established. Baptista was elected President of the League which he led for several years. Indeed, he was the first to see the possibilities of British Labour Party connections in helping to further the cause of Indian nationalist aspirations. Thus, in 1917, he  arrived  in  England,  'as  the  vanguard  of  the  Indian  delegation'.  His appeals  to  the  Labour  Party  were  successful  to  the  extent  that  the  party pledged  itself  to  support  the  principle  of  self-determination. 21 Baptista's confidence in the Labour Party was based on his belief that the party was democratic in principle and in practice.

Moreover, he was encouraged when Annie Besant followed his lead by forming her own Home Rule League. The agitations of both organisations helped to disseminate the idea of Home Rule which spread like wildfire. In 1916  the  Home  Rulers  were  able  to  capture  the  Indian  Congress  at Lucknow. Although Baptista recognised the national status and leadership of Gokhale, his political hero and guru was B. G. Tilak. It is fitting that both

Baptista and Tilak should come to Britain to work as ambassadors of the Indian Home Rule Movement.

In  spite  of  the  growing  awareness  of  nationalist  feeling  in  India, Baptista never lost sight of the importance of support from British Labour. Thus,  at  the  Annual  Conference  of  the  Home  Rule  League  in  1917,  a resolution was passed urging the necessity and urgency of sending a strong deputation of representatives and influential men to England. Tilak's choice was Baptista. 22 About the same time, Annie Besant announced the need for support  for  her  own  Movement  in  England.  Consequently,  Ramswamy Aiyar came to Britain.

Baptista,  the  first  man  to  go  to  England  for  the  noble  cause  of  Home Rule agitation, had the task of making propaganda for Home Rule in India among  the  British  people.  Both  Aiyar  and  Baptista  had  to  explain  the Congress-Home  Rule  Scheme  to  the  English. Among  the  London  Home Rule  League's  prominent  members  who  held  meetings  and  interviewed newspaper editors  were  George  Lansbury,  Lady  Emily  and  Graham  Pole. One  of  Lansbury's  meetings  was  with  Montagu,  Secretary  of  State  for India. He suggested Annie Besant's release from internment. Moreover, the London  branch  of  the  League  also  arranged  meetings  for  Baptista  who spoke for Besant's release.

Soon after arriving in London in September 1917, Baptista made close contacts  with  the  Labour  Party  and  British  working  class  leaders.  He  not only addressed meetings, but also wrote articles for the Herald .  He  wrote regularly to Tilak, informing him in October 1917 that he had accompanied Lansbury to six important centres and had spoken on Home Rule and that he was attending the Annual Conference of the Labour Party as the Indian Home Rule League's representative.

Baptista continued to make good progress. There was a great demand from labour leaders for him to speak. He was aware of 'a splendid feeling in favour of the union of India and the British people', and that there was an inquisitiveness  among  the  English  about  India's  political  problems.  Thus, he again underlined the need for 'half a dozen influential Indian volunteers for propagating the Home Rule movement in England'. 23

With  these despatches, Tilak had grown  even  more  enthusiastic. Simultaneously,  he  placed  much  importance  in  educating  English  voters and on the creation of favourable public opinion for the Indian Home Rule

Movement.  For  this,  the  time  was  right  in  that  the  English  were  already discussing  India's  needs  and  rights.  Having  declared  his  position  as  a foreign  agitator,  it  would  have  been  incredible  if  Baptista's  movements were not monitored by the forces of law and order. He reported to Tilak that the  police  attended  all  his  lectures  and  passed  on  their  reports  to  the government.

Outside London, his lecture tour took him to Glasgow, Dundee, parts of Lancashire  and  Hull,  where  Labour  Party  leaders  passed  a  resolution  in favour  of  Indian  Home  Rule. Although  he  was  confident  that  'when  the Labour Party is on our side …we shall get complete Home Rule', even then he felt that this agitation for Home Rule must continue in England.

Finally, in accordance with Baptista's wishes, it was decided to send a large  deputation  to  England  including Tilak,  Khaparde,  Karandikar,  Bipin Chandra Pal and Kelkar. Much was expected of this deputation. When they arrived in Madras (on their way to England) Annie Besant received them, accompanied by prominent Congressmen and Home Rulers. Tilak addressed the 20,000 people who showed their support. He told them that the deputation was not going to England to appeal to the generosity of the British people, but rather to tell the British to save the Empire by trusting India  instead  of  Japan,  and  granting  her  Home  Rule. When,  however,  the deputation reached Colombo, Tilak was informed that their passports were cancelled. This evoked protests from all parts of India. Tilak, in particular, was black-listed. He was not invited to the War Conference called by the Viceroy at Delhi. The victimisation of the Home Rule Movement leaders, Tilak  and  Besant,  who  were  excluded  from  the  Conference,  resulted  in numerous public meetings throughout India in protest. In response, on 22 April 1918, Tilak, Besant and their followers signed a manifesto which was sent  to  the  British  government,  stating  that  'if  India  is  to  make  great sacrifices for the Empire, it must be as a partner in the Empire and not a Dependency'. 24

Baptista felt  it  was  fortunate  that  he  was  in  England,  'otherwise  there would have been nobody to take India's side'. Later on, however, Tilak was permitted to visit England in connection with the Valentine Chirol case, on the condition that he would not engage in political agitation in England. He arrived in London on 19 October 1918. While in England, Tilak was elected President  of  the  Indian  National  Congress.  He  could  not  accept  this,  but

when  the  delegations  of  the  Home  Rule  League  and  the  Indian  National Congress went to England, Tilak became a member of both.

With Tilak in  England,  Baptista  felt  great  confidence  that  their  Home Rule  mission  could  be  achieved.  Tilak  met  the  British  Prime  Minister, Lloyd George, and got the ban on his political work removed. Moreover, before the elections, he ensured that the British electorate was adequately supplied with important pamphlets on Indian politics. During the election campaign, the Labour Party repeatedly pledged its support for Indian Home Rule. They suffered a landslide defeat, to Baptista and Tilak's disappointment.

Later, when the Montagu-Chelmsford Reform Scheme was announced, Tilak was disappointed. It was not even a close approximation to Swaraj . He  regarded  the  proposals  as  'only  one  more  hesitant  step  in  the  long process toward self-determination'.

What irritated Baptista was the progress by stages approach adopted by the  British  government.  He  reminded British readers that their parliament did not apply it in the case of the abolition of slavery.

Tilak sent Baptista and Karandikar (who had accompanied him) back to India.  Tilak  took  Baptista's  advice  that  closer  friendly  contacts  with  the Labour Party should be developed. For the rest of his stay in England, his concentration on political work, 'one mad rush', was spent largely attending social  functions  and  holding  political  discussions  with  Indian  and  British friends. He returned to India in 1919.

Thus, after doing more substantial work in England (during a period of 20  months)  than  any  of  his  predecessors,  Baptista,  the  President  of  the Home Rule League was back in India. His work with the Labour Party was 'so successful' that the Party was 'now irrevocably committed' to the cause of winning Home Rule for India. His achievement was one of the greatest landmarks in the history of India, and one cannot be too grateful to him for that. The Indians were unanimous in their praise for his work in England.

After Tilak's death, Mahatma Gandhi joined the All India Home Rule League  and  became  President.  Thus  his  splendid  isolation  ended.  He explained that the causes which he wanted to promote through the Home Rule League were Swadeshi , Hindu-Muslim unity with special reference to the Khilafat and linguistic redistribution of the Provinces. He was particularly careful that he should not be misunderstood. Since he belonged to no party, he promised that he would not treat the All India Home Rule

League as a party organisation. Indeed, he was also aware of the League's constitution  but  never  argued  that  he  would  try  to  mould  the  League's policy  to  make  the  Congress  retain  its  national  character.  He  was  most concerned about winning the confidence of League members. But, changes were inevitable. Gandhi felt that the Home Rule League had to match the changed political situation in India. Consequently, a sub-committee, appointed  in  early  September  1920,  to  revise  the  League's  constitution, recommended certain changes which were made on 3 October 1920. The Home  Rule  League  was  re-named Swarajya  Sabha .  Among  those  who opposed this  move  was  M. A.  Jinnah. With  time,  as  the Swarajya Sabha (Home  Rule  League)  lost  its  identity,  it  merged  into  the  Indian  National Congress.  As  the  movement  for  Home  Rule  became  a  spent  force,  the prestige of Baptista also declined. 25

Tilak's  death,  then,  was  an  irreparable  loss  to  Baptista.  The  new leadership  of  Gandhi,  opposed  to  some  aspects  of  the  political  ideal  of Baptista,  led  to  the  rise  of  Gandhi  and  the  eclipse  of  Baptista  in  Indian politics. This was the turning point in Baptista's political career. In the 1924 elections  he  was  elected  for  North  Bombay,  to  the  Bombay  Legislative Council, and in 1926 was elected (uncontested) to the Bombay Legislative Assembly. 26 He remained an advocate of Dominion status and the British connection.  He  dissociated  himself  from  unconstitutional  methods  which were employed in the cause of political progress.

Moreover, Baptista had devoted much time in the service of the Indian trade unions. He was not only President of several unions, but also one of the founders of the All India Trade Union Congress in 1921. Furthermore, in  1924  he  was  the  Labour  delegate  to  the  Geneva  Labour  Conference, under  the  League  of  Nations  constitution.  After  1926,  his  failing  health forced  his  retirement  from  active  politics.  Whatever  influence  he  had  in both  politics  and  civic  affairs  was,  in  the  face  of  rising  militancy  and unconstitutional  methods  in  achieving  the  goal  of Swaraj ,  greatly  at  risk. Nonetheless, as a Home Ruler - indeed, the 'father' of the movement - he had made a major contribution in helping to stir the Indian masses. He died on 18 September 1930, leaving the struggle to others.

One  of  the  most  devoted  and  militant  Indian  nationalists  to  visit England was Shapurji Saklatvala. He was also a tireless worker in the cause of workers everywhere, immersing himself in both trade union and political

struggles, particularly in Britain and India. On both counts, Saklatvala was more  radical  than  either  Baptista  or  Gandhi.  Indeed,  his  work  in  Britain both  as  a  Communist  Member  of  Parliament  and  at  grass-roots  level  far exceeded that of Joseph Baptista or any other Asian, at least before him.

## Shapurji Saklatvala: from capitalism to communism

Saklatvala played a glorious role as one of the pioneers of the international working  class  movement.  If,  as  Lenin  said,  'Capital  is  an  international force.  Its  defeat  requires  an  international  brotherhood', 27 then  Saklatvala symbolised  such  an  international  brotherhood  of  workers.  R.  Palme  Dutt recognised  him  as  a  heroic  figure who  fought  on  many  fronts:  for international communism, for Indian national liberation and for the causes of the British working class movement. 28 Indeed, he became the first Indian to be accepted and loved by British workers.

His  development  from  capitalism  to  Communism  reflects  a  spiritual odyssey.  From  a  wealthy  family  background,  he  was  able  to  make  a passionate  commitment  towards  finding  a  means  to  end  the  poverty  and misery of the masses in India. As he told Palme Dutt, there were four stages in  this  spiritual  odyssey.  First  he  sought  in  religion  the  key  that  would unlock the door to a new awakening and advance of the nation. He realised, however, that instead of providing a solution, religion led only to passivity and a sanctifying of the existing unacceptable order of society. Second, he turned to science as a means of helping the Indian people. After years of scientific studies (and having been an active welfare worker in the plague hospitals  and  slums  of  Bombay)  he  found  that  science  alone  offered  no solution unless it was applied in practice to the economy. Third, he felt that in order to end Indian poverty, industrial development was necessary. This led to the establishment of the Tata iron and steel industry in India. Soon, however, his open advocacy of Indian national liberation ran afoul of the authorities. Consequently,  the  Tata  firm  sent  him  to  Britain  as  their departmental  manager.  Finally,  to  climax  his  spiritual pilgrimage,  he entered the world of the National Liberal Club, but quickly found among its members  a  narrow  outlook  and  snobbish  h
