## The Regulation Approach: Theory and History

In  the  past  two  decades  the  French  (or  Paris)  School  of  Economic  Regulation has  developed  an  ambitious  historical-economic  theory  which  has  already  had a  major  impact  on  efforts  to  understand  the  current  malaise  of  the  capitalist system  and  the  accompanying  economic  transformations. 1 On  the  face  of  it, the  School's  favourable  reception  is  not  difficult  to  explain.  The  Theory  of Regulation  responds  to  the  belief,  widespread  today,  that  orthodox  economics  has  failed  to  interpret  satisfactorily  actual  patterns  of  development,  past  or contemporary,  and  that,  in  particular,  its  tendency  to  economic  determinism prevents  it from  taking  into  account  in  systematic  fashion  the  powerful ways  in  which  historically  developed  class  relations,  institutional  forms  and, more  generally,  political  action  have  shaped  the  evolution  of  capitalist economies.  For  their  part, then, the Regulationists  explicitly seek to go beyond  the  ahistorical  verities  of  neoclassical  economics.  Their  relationship to  Marxist  approaches  is  less  clear.  Yet  it  would  seem  that  their  original intention  was  to  grasp  how  networks  of  institutional  forms,  during  the

successive epochs in which they held sway, have affected the expression of-or actually modified-the underlying tendencies or laws of capital accumulation as these have been analysed in the Marxist tradition. 2

The  Regulationists  begin,  methodologically,  from  the  idea  that  the overly  abstract  and  ineffectual  character  of  much  existing  economic theory,  as  well  as  the  undertheorized  nature  of  much  existing  economic  history,  derive  from  'insufficient  links  between  theory  and empirical  analysis  on  the  one  hand  and  from  purely  deductive  and inductive methods on the other'. Their fundamental goal is to provide those  links  through  'build[ing]  a  series  of  intermediate  models'  to make  theory  more  historically  concrete  and  empirically  testable,  as well as more useful for historical interpretation. 3

The Regulationists thus deny that the capitalist mode of production is comprehensible in terms of a single set of laws that remain unchanged from its inception until its eventual supersession. They see the history of  capitalism,  rather,  as  a  succession  of  phases,  each  distinguished  by certain  historically  developed,  socio-institutionally  defined  structural forms  that  give  rise,  so  long  as  they  are  maintained,  to  distinctive economic  trends  and  patterns.  There  is  an  obvious  similarity  to  the Marxist project of grasping history more generally in terms of a series of  historically  developed  modes  of  production,  each  marked  by  a structure  of  social-property  relations  that  give  rise,  so  long  as  it  is

Mark Glick wishes to acknowledge  that  his  contribution  to  this  project  relies  strongly  on  earlier  research  with Dumenil  and  Levy.

2 Aglietta's  founding  statement  of  the  theory  of  regulation  attempts  to  present  it  on systematically Marxist foundations. Lipietz has more or less followed in this tradition. Boyer, on the other hand, in his very useful summary of the Regulationists' main theses -'Technical Change and the Theory of 'Regulation' ', in G. Dosi et al., eds., Technical Change and Economic Theory , London 1988 -aims for 'a new theoretical framework which would  combine  a  critique  of  Marxian  orthodoxy  and  an  extension  of  Kaleckian  and Keynesian macroeconomic ideas, in order to rejuvenate a variant of early institutional or  historical  theory'  (p. 70 ).  Still,  Boyer  elsewhere  says:  'Making  use  of  long-term  or medium-term history  to  enrich  and  elaborate  Marxian  intuitions:  such  is  the  goal  of Regulationist approaches.'

maintained, to distinctive  forms  of  economic  behaviour  and  systemic laws  of  motion.  Indeed,  the  Regulationists'  key  concepts  of mode  of regulation and regime  of  accumulation can  be  seen  to  function  with respect to the Regulationists' phases within capitalist history-called modes of developmentrather analogously to the way in which the Marxist  concepts social  relations  of  production and forces  of  production function with respect to the modes of production. Moreover, just as a number of recent  Marxist  theorists  refuse  to  see the  fundamental  socialproperty  structures  that  constitute  a  mode  of  production  as  either technologically or economically determined or as following a unilineal pattern of evolution, the Regulationists similarly insist that the structural  forms  that  constitute  their  modes  (or  phases)  of  development within the history of capitalism must be understood as the outcome, to a significant degree, of class and political struggles.

It is the purpose of this essay to analyse and evaluate the Regulationists' theory in terms of their own distinctive aspirations by examining, theoretically  and  historically,  the  conceptual  links  that  they  have actually  constructed  between  high  theory  and  economic  history,  and specifically  the  series  of  'intermediate  models'  through  which  they have  sought  to  understand  capitalist  development.  Let  us  therefore begin  by  surveying  the  basic  concepts  and  the  main  theoreticalhistorical results of the School.

## I Basic Concepts and Fundamental Results

Each regime  of  accumulation represents  a  distinct  pattern  of  economic evolution which, though limited in historical time, is relatively stable. The  immediate  source  of  the  dynamic  specific  to  each  regime  of accumulation  is  a  particular  series  of  regularities  which  include:  (i) the pattern of productive organization within firms which defines the wage-earners' work with the means of production; (ii) the time horizon  for  decisions  about  capital  formation;  (iii)  the  distribution  of income among wages, profits and taxes; (iv) the volume and composition  of  effective  demand;  and  (v)  the  connection  between  capitalism and  non-capitalist  modes  of  production. 4 What  is  distinctive  about the  Regulationists'  standpoint  is  that  the  content  of  the  regularities defining the pattern of economic growth that constitutes a regime of accumulation is viewed largely as an expression of institutional structures  governing  intra-  and  inter-firm  relations,  the  relations  among capitals  and  the  relationship  between  capital  and  labour-namely, the mode  of  regulation. (Regularity  (v)  seems  to  sit  somewhat  uneasily with  the  others,  since  it  obviously  cannot  be  grasped  simply  as  a function of capitalist institutions, and this is a point to which we shall have to return.)

Each mode  of  regulation is constituted  by  a  historically  developed,

relatively  integrated  network  of  institutions  that  reproduces  the  fundamental  capitalist  property  relationships,  guides  the  prevailing regime  of  accumulation,  and  helps  make  compatible  the  myriad decentralized  decisions,  potentially  contradictory  and  conflictual, taken by the economy's individual units. It functions, in particular, so as to achieve 'a certain match between the transformation of the conditions of production  (volume  of  capital  employed,  distribution between  branches,  and  norms  of  production)  and  transformation  in the  conditions  of  final  consumption  (norms  of  consumption  of  wage workers  and  other  social  classes,  collective  expenditures).'  The  network of institutions that compose the mode of regulation governs the accumulation  process  by  establishing:  (i)  the  nature  of  the  capitalwage labour nexus and (ii) the type of inter-capitalist competition, as well as (iii) the character of monetary and credit relationships, (iv) the manner of adhesion of the firms of the national economy to the international  economy,  and  (v)  the  forms  of  the  state's  intervention  into the  economy. 5 In  fact,  in  the  actual  working  out  of  their  theory,  the Regulationists  have  focused  primarily  on  the  first  two  of  these  institutional  nexuses.  Indeed:  'one  of  the  many  structural  forms  emerges as  being  especially  important: wage/labour  relations . . . the  process  of socialization of productive activity under capitalism', that is, 'the network  of  legal  and  institutional  conditions  governing  the  use  and reproduction  of  the  workforce'.  As  Boyer  sums  up,  'this  concept  is sufficiently broad for us to be able to anticipate a priori close linkages between the form of wage/labour relations and the method of regulation'  and  the  great  'extent  to  which  economic  crisis  and  change  in wage/labour relations determine one another'. 6

The combination of mode of regulation with regime of accumulation gives  rise,  from  the  Regulationist  standpoint,  to  a  distinctive mode of development , with  a  distinctive  type  of  cyclical,  non-threatening  and self-regulating crisis. The extension in time of each mode of development  ultimately  issues  in  a  series  of  ever  more  crippling  contradictions,  which  result  from  the  fetters  imposed  by  the  already-existing mode of regulation upon the regime of accumulation. As the mode of development reproduces itself, hitherto virtuous circles thus give way to increasingly vicious circles. The outcome is a structural crisis , which -precisely because the old mode of regulation has broken down-is accompanied  by  the  necessarily unregulated and conflictual action  of classes,  firms,  political  groups  and  governments.  Out  of  these  historically indeterminate  processes  of  competitive  economic  war  and socioeconomic and political struggle, one out of a range of alternative resolutions  of  the  crisis  is  eventually  hit  upon.  A  new,  historically given mode of regulation-which, by governing the historically developed regime of accumulation, makes possible a new mode of development-is the result.

The Regulation School developed the foregoing battery of concepts in

close  connection with its ongoing investigation of the various historical  phases  of  capitalist  development.  Essentially,  it  has  come  to  specify  two  regimes  of  accumulation-the  extensive  and  the  intensiveand  two  modes  of  regulation-the  competitive  and  the  monopoly. Under the extensive regime of accumulation, growth takes place predominantly  on  the  basis  of  artisanal  productive  techniques  via  the application  of  methods  of  lengthening  the  working  day  and  intensifying labour, as well as expanding the size of the labour force. Productivity  growth  is  therefore  limited,  as  is  the  potential  for  mass consumption.  Under  the  intensive  regime,  growth  takes  place  predominantly  via  investment  in  fixed  capital  embodying  technical advance-which  creates  the  potential  for  regular  increases  both  in productivity  and  in  mass  consumption.  The  competitive  mode  of regulation is distinguished from the monopoly mode, most crudely, as follows: in the former, there is craft control and the competitive determination of prices and especially of wages; in the latter, there is scientific management,  an  oligopolistic  system  of  pricing,  and,  most characteristically,  the  determination  of  wages  through  a  complex  system of capital-labour and governmental institutions-the social regulation of the mode of consumption.

On the basis of this typology, the Regulationists have come to identify  three  successive  modes  of  development  in  the  economic  history of  Western  capitalism  over  the  last  century  and  a  half,  each  representing  a  distinctive  combination  of  one  of  the  foregoing  modes of regulation and one of the foregoing regimes of accumulation. First, through  most  of  the  nineteenth  century,  a  competitive  mode  of regulation  prevailed  and  imposed  an  extensive  regime  of  accumulation.  Second,  under  the  pressure  of  class  struggle  and  technical change,  there  arose  at  various  historical  junctures-from  the  first decades  of  the  twentieth  century  in  the  United  States-a  new  mode of  development.  Here,  craft  control  was  sufficiently  weakened  and inter-firm competition  sufficiently controlled to allow for the emergence  of  intensive  accumulation.  However,  this  new  mode  of development  turned  out  to  be  unstable  because  the  mode  of regulation, still essentially competitive, was unable to institutionalize the  expanding  mass  consumption  that  was  required  to  underpin  the expanding  mass  production  made  possible  by  intensive  accumulation. The result was the severe structural crisis-conceived as a crisis of  overinvestment  and  underconsumption-of  the  interwar  period, leading  to  the  depression  of  the 1930 s. Thirdly,  especially  in consequence  of  the  class  struggles  of  the 1930 s, there  emerged  a new mode of regulation  which  finally  made  possible  the  full  flowering  of intensive accumulation  and  an  unprecedentedly  successful period  of  capitalist  development.  This  monopoly  mode  of  regulation resolved  the  contradictions  of  the  previous  mode  of  development by  providing  for  the  rise  of  mass  consumption  and  thereby  constituted the foundations for a new mode of development called 'Fordist'.  However,  the  historical  repetition  of  the  very  processes  that  had underwritten  prosperity eventually proved  problematic, as the progressive  perfection  of  the  Fordist  labour  process  resulted  in  the exhaustion  of  the  system's  capacity  for  developing  the  productive forces  and  for  underwriting  the  steady  growth  of  productivity.  The

upshot was the structural crisis of the Fordist mode of developmentconceived above all as a crisis of productivity-that we are experiencing today. 7

In the remainder of this article, we shall consider, one by one, each of the aforementioned modes of development, their structural crises and the transitions between them. In each case we shall proceed by: ( 1 ) clarifying each mode's developmental logic and empirical basis from the Regulationists'  standpoint;  ( 2 )  critically  interrogating  its  conceptual  status; and ( 3 )  investigating its empirical warrant, especially with respect to what Aglietta terms the exemplary case, that of the United States.

## II Mode of Development One: Competitive Regulation and Extensive Accumulation

The  mode  of  development  characteristic  of  the  United  States  and parts of Europe until at least the early decades of the twentieth century expressed  the  predominance  of  a competitive  mode  of  regulation , which governed a regime of extensive accumulation.

## 1 . The Economic Consequences of Extensive Accumulation Governed by Competitive Regulation

Under  extensive  accumulation,  production  was  characteristically based  on  artisanal  labour.  Management,  for  its  part,  operated  in terms of short time-horizons and limited its placements of fixed capital. As a result, new capital investment tended to embody extant productive  techniques,  rather  than  transformed  ones.  There  was,  of course,  'significant  use  of  science  in  production  processes,  but  firms mainly tr[ied] to apply existing knowledge to their business and d[id] not  strive  to  improve  them  continuously.' 8 The  overall  outcome,  in Aglietta's  words,  was  that  'under  the  regime  of  extensive  accumulation . . . absolute surplus-value predominates ' and 'the length of the working day is the principal means of extracting surplus labour'. 9 Growth was  therefore  made  possible  predominantly  by  means  of  extending and  intensifying  labour,  a  spectacular  increase  in  the  labour  force, and a dramatic expansion of the system in geographical space.

Extensive  accumulation  is  explicable,  from  the  Regulationist  standpoint, in terms of the overarching competitive mode of regulation that maintained  and  governed  it.  It  was  the  institutionalized  forms  of capital-capital  and  capital-labour  relationships  constituted  by  competitive  regulation  that  were  responsible  for  restricted  capital  investment and limited growth of the productive forces. These fetters upon capital  accumulation  came  in  part  from  the  supply  side.  Within firms,  craft  workers  were  able  to  exert  considerable  control  over  the labour  process,  thereby  limiting  management's  freedom  to  introduce

innovations  in  production.  Capital-capital  or  inter-firm  relations were characterized by cutthroat competition among many uncoordinated  units,  so  that  the  investment  environment  displayed  a  high degree  of  risk  and  uncontrollability.  Forced  to  prioritize  short-term returns,  management  shied  away  from  technical  changes  requiring large-scale  placements  of  fixed  capital  and  from  extensive  expenditures on research and development. 10

Nevertheless, from the standpoint of the Regulationists, the key fetter was  to  be  found  on  the  side  of  demand.  Competitive  regulation allowed levels of direct exploitation in the labour process sufficient to support ongoing capital accumulation. At the same time, it imposed strict  limits  on  the  growth  of  mass  consumption,  which  decisively cramped  the  trajectory  of  capital  accumulation.  These  demand-side constraints  derived,  on  the  one  hand,  from  the  relationship  of  early capital  accumulation  to  its  non-capitalist  environment,  and,  on  the other  hand,  from  the  institutions  governing  the  capital-labour  relationship within capitalism itself.

In this view of things, the working class, until at least the beginning of the  twentieth  century,  secured  much  of  its  means  of  reproduction from  outside  the  sphere  of  commodity  production,  apparently  from its relationship to still-largely non-capitalist rural households and villages.  The  workers'  'environment  [was]  characterized  by  close  relationships between town and country, by a rhythm of work punctuated by  season  and  stabilized  by  custom,  by  an  incomplete  separation between productive and domestic activities, and by a domination of noncommodity  relations  over  commodity  relations  in  the  mode  of  consumptionnon-commodity  relations  finding  the  conditions  for  their  existence within  the  extended  family  and  neighbourhood  community.'  This 'reconstitution  of  labour-power  by  a  non-capitalist  environment  in which  it  [was]  still  inserted . . . ma[de]  it  possible  to  pay  very  low wages and impose very long working hours.' 11 For  these  reasons,  the workers could constitute only a strictly  limited  market  for  consumer goods.

Moreover, the very processes by which precapitalist societies were dissolved themselves exerted a downward pressure on wages. Direct producers  were  rendered  dependent  upon  the  purchase  of  commodities for  their  reproduction,  and  their  separation en  masse from direct nonmarket  access  to  their  means  of  subsistence  had  the  effect  of depressing  working-class  incomes  and  consuming  power.  Workers from  rural  villages  and  small  towns  flooded  the  great  US industrial cities, where they were joined by wave after wave of immigrants from Europe  and  Asia. 12 When  workers  finally  entered  the  overstocked capitalist labour market, they found the institutional forms governing capital-labour  relations stacked  against  them.  Under  competitive regulation, an  essentially unregulated  labour  market,  marked  by

limited  unionization  and  little  intervention  of  the  state  to  maintain labour-power,  prevailed.  The  result  was,  again,  powerful  downward pressure on wages, limiting consumer demand.

For  the  Regulationists,  restricted  consumer  demand,  resulting  from competitive regulation, provides the key not only to the first mode of development,  but  to  their  entire  historical  conception  of  capitalist evolution. On the one hand, a necessary precondition for the full flowering  of  mass  production  is  the  rise  of  mass  consumption;  but  on  the other  hand,  the  rise  of  mass  consumption  cannot  be  brought  about merely  by  transforming  production,  the  labour  process. 13 In  consequence,  the  establishment  of  mass  production  of  the  means  of working-class consumption depends upon the success of sociopolitical struggles  in  setting  up  institutions  to  guarantee  the  working-class norm  of  consumption.  It  was  thus  'the  transformation  of  the  conditions of existence of the working class which enabled methods of relative surplus-value  production  to  be  generalized  throughout  Department II.' 14 Capitalists  would  not  make  the  investments  to  transform  the labour  process  and  develop  the  forces  of  production  in  the  department  producing  consumption  goods  unless  and  until  there  had emerged a mass market for its products;  this  required  'the  establishment  of  social  controls  to  guarantee  the  formation  of  the  workingclass  norm  of  consumption'. 15 Aglietta  thus  emphasizes  time  and again the 'need for a comprehensive linkage between the two departments of production, and the absence of any automatic mechanism to balance  their  development'. 16 In  the  absence  of  such  a  linkage,  the effect of technical change originating in Department I on Department II will  be  doubly  limited:  Department  II will  fail  to  adopt  the  new methods;  goods  produced  in  Department  II will  fail  to  decrease  in price,  cutting  off  a  corresponding  increase  in  real  wages.  Aglietta's logical conclusion  is  that the historical appearance  of  sufficient effective  demand to underwrite the mass production of working-class consumption goods is ultimately 'linked to the way in which the class struggle  either  succeeds  or  does  not  succeed  in  revolutionizing  the conditions  of  production  and  exchange,  and  consequently  in  calling forth an expansion in the mass of commodities produced.' 17

So  long,  then,  as  competitive  regulation  prevailed,  its  capital-labour relationship  prevented  any  definitive  break  beyond  the  regime  of extensive  accumulation  and  made  possible,  at  best,  a  highly  punctuated  growth  of  Department  I.  As  Aglietta  spells  out  the  macroeconomics of the Regulationists' first mode of development: 'As long as capitalism transforms the labour process by the creation of collective  means  of  production,  but  without  reshaping  the  mode  of  consumption,  accumulation  still  progresses  only  in  fits  and  starts.  The

regime  of  accumulation  is  principally  an extensive one,  based  on  the build up of heavy industry section by section. The resultant jerkiness is a function of the uneven development of Department 1 .' 18

## The us as Exemplary Case

The fact remains that, in the Regulationist schema, growth could and did proceed relatively successfully under the mode of development in which  competitive  regulation  governed  extensive accumulation because  capital  had  access  to  enormous  regions  with  inexhaustible supplies  of  raw  materials  and  cheap  labour  power.  According  to Aglietta,  the  'exemplary  nation'  of  this  mode  of  economic  development  was  the  United  States,  from  the  late  eighteenth  century  right through  World  War  I  and  beyond.  Here  growth  took  place  largely according  to  the  'frontier principle', focused  on  the  securing  of valuable  minerals  and  cheap  agricultural  products.  It  based  itself most especially on the technical and commercial dynamism of farmer (owner-operator)  capitalism.  The  rise  of  this  system  of  property  relations was conditioned by relatively easy access to land, insured in the initial  class  and  anti-colonial  struggles  of  the  new  republic,  and  consolidated  through  the  efforts  of  powerful  speculators  and  railroad developers.  Agricultural  output  thus  grew  by  leaps  and  bounds throughout  the  final  two  thirds  of  the  nineteenth  century,  as  the economy  expanded  in  space  and  registered  spectacular  increases  in agricultural productivity. Meanwhile,  mining  developed  apace  to exploit  the  mineral  deposits  that  were  discovered  in  one  frontier region  after  another.  Both  agriculture  and  mining  stimulated,  and were stimulated by, the dynamic growth of railroads, perhaps the key Department 1 industry in Aglietta's account of the nineteenth century and itself a powerful stimulus to iron, steel and coal production.

The continuity of this process was made possible by wave after wave of  cheap,  unorganized  labourers,  recruited  from  the  farms  and  from abroad.  Labouring  under  terrible  conditions,  these  workers  were compelled to cede most of an output that was made to grow largely through the intensification of labour and the extension of the working day, and not primarily through productivity increases and the growth of  the  organic  composition  of  capital. 19 In  the  end,  therefore,  the long-term  tendency  of  the  mode  of  development  based  on  extensive accumulation  and  competitive  regulation  was,  in  Boyer's  words,  that 'productivity is quasi-stagnating, so are real wages, while . . . growth is only obtained by a lengthening of the working hours or by the hiring of more workers.' 20 But the consummation of that tendency could, in the US at least, be put off for a lengthy period through the exploitation of the extraordinary opportunities offered by the frontier.

## 2 . Competitive Regulation and Extensive Accumulation: A Mode of Development under Capitalism?

The  initial  mode  of  development  in  the  Regulationists'  schema  of

phases  of  capitalist  evolution  is  thus  constituted  by  a  regime  of accumulation  based  primarily  upon  the  extraction  of  absolute surplus-value  that  results  from  the  mode  of  competitive  regulation. Such a model, however, with its characteristic fetters on technological change and mass consumption, appears puzzling in the light of what we know, or thought we knew, about the basic traits of the capitalist mode  of  production-specifically,  our  view  of  the  normal  forms  of individual  economic  behaviour  and  of  the  aggregate  patterns  of  economic  growth  that  result  from  the  prevalence  of  capitalist  socialproperty relations per se. First, what sort of capitalism is it in which the extraction of absolute surplus-value is predominant? Second, what sort of historically extended process of capital accumulation is it that takes  place  without  significant  increases  in  both  the  real  wage  and aggregate consumption? Thirdly, why should the scope and intensity of capital accumulation in this phase be limited by the lack of institutionally insured levels of consumption? The point is not that it is conceptually  impossible  to  specify  specific  socioeconomic  environments or  institutional  conditions  in  which  capitalist  development  might take  place  predominantly  on  the  basis  of  absolute  surplus-value,  or where  accumulation  might  occur  without  a  corresponding  growth  of consumption,  or  where  restricted  consumption  might  hinder  further investment. The question that needs to be asked is, on what basis can the Regulationists posit an entire, normal, initial phase of institutionally  determined  development-an  entire  epoch-in  which  capitalist social-property  relations  have  been  fully  established,  yet  which  operates predominantly by intensifying labour and lengthening the working  day,  keeps  working-class  wages  and  aggegrate  consumption  from rising,  and  finds  the  road  to  mass  production  blocked  by  restricted mass consumption?

The  Regulationists'  answer,  as  already  implied,  would  appear  to  rest simply  upon:  one,  the  modifying  effects  of  the  broader  pre-capitalist socioeconomic environment within which their first mode of development historically emerged; and two, the structuring effects of the network of capitalist institutions constituted by the competitive mode of regulation  itself.  Still,  given  that  both  sets  of  effects  are  supposed  to have  actually  reversed  or  cancelled  out  fundamental  developmental tendencies widely understood to be built into capitalist social-property relations  per  se,  the  Regulationists  should-one  would  think-have felt obliged not only to treat more explicitly the paradoxical character of their result, but also to make much more clear the manner by which they  arrived  at  it.  For,  where  capitalist  social-property  relations  are fully established, we can, all else being equal, expect to find: development on the basis of relative surplus-value; long-term capital accumulation bringing about rises in wages and aggregate consumption; and investment  and  cost-cutting  technical  change  leading  to,  but  not necessarily conditioned by, growth of the mass market. It will be our argument, in fact,  that  the  Regulationists  have  reached  their  conclusions in essentially two ways: by focusing on some, but ignoring other, economic  effects  of  the  institutions  of  extensive  accumulation  and competitive regulation; and by assuming, without sufficient justification, that certain tendencies arising from the environment constituted by the competitive mode of regulation-either its broader historically

determined  precapitalist  socioeconomic  setting  or  the  historically specific structure of capitalist institutions-will have sufficient quantitative weight to set their mark on the overall path of development, the regime of accumulation.

## Competition, Risk and Investment

Let  us  consider  first  the  Regulationists'  contention  that  the  capitalcapital  institutional  structure  characterized  by  a  multitude  of  decentralized,  competitive  firms  tended  to  stifle  the  investment  in  fixed capital  required  for  technical  change  and  that,  for  this  reason,  it tended  to  bias  individual  enterprises  toward  profit-making  through the methods of increasing absolute surplus-value and the system as a whole  toward  extensive  accumulation.  It  is  undoubtedly  true,  as  the Regulationists argue, that capitalists have found the risk of investing in  fixed  capital  under  fiercely  competitive  conditions  to  pose  significant  problems  for  capital  accumulation  and  thus  technical  change. Yet  most  previous  interpreters  of  capitalist  development,  whether Marxist  or  non-Marxist,  implicitly  or  explicitly,  have  assumed  that, since  the  origins  of  capitalism  itself,  the  same  competitive  environment  has  tended  to  make  such  investment  unavoidable.  They  have done  so  for  the  obvious  reason  that  inter-capitalist  competition  is thought  to  impose,  in  tendency  if  not  in  every  individual  case,  an inexorable pressure on firms to maximize cost-cutting so as to realize temporary surplus profits or technological rents, thereby maintaining themselves against  competitors,  and  to  accrue  sufficient  surpluses  for adequate  further  investment.  Those  firms  that  do  not  sufficiently reduce costs are forced out of business. The constraint imposed upon investment  by  risk  has  thus  appeared  to  be  a  strictly  relative  one, incapable  in  itself  of  constituting  any  long-term  barrier  to  development by the methods of increasing relative surplus-value.

It should perhaps be noted in passing that, although the level of fixed capital  commitment  required  for  increasingly  advanced  production, for  technical  change,  has  unquestionably  risen  over  time,  it  has  done so  unevenly,  and  hardly  universally.  The  classic  counter-example  is the revolution in agricultural production of the sixteenth through the eighteenth century in England. This brought about major reductions in food costs, with epoch-making repercussions for economic development,  largely  by  way  of  increased  specialization  and  the  reorganization  of  farms  requiring  significant  but,  in  absolute  terms,  not  very large  capital  investments.  In  manufacturing  itself,  moreover,  the  history of technical change has by no means been confined to the growth of  machinofacture  requiring  greater  capital  investment,  but  has  also, to  a  significant  degree,  been  constituted  by  processes  of  productivity advance carried out through the extension of the division of labour in manufacture (the break-up of tasks into ever simpler components/the growth of  detail  labour),  the  perfection  of  cooperation,  and  the  reorganization  of  production  so  as  to  make  more  efficient  use  of  raw materials,  tools  and  labour-power.  (See,  in  the  recent  period,  just-intime production.) Throughout the history of capitalism, then, growth has  tended,  to  an  important  (if  limited)  extent,  to  take  place  on  the basis  of  extending  relative  surplus-value  even  without  major  investments in fixed capital.

The really fundamental point, however, is that while the initial investment  required  for  successful  innovative  accumulation  has  tended  to rise  throughout  the  history  of  capitalism,  entrepreneurs  and  their financiers have found it sensible to assume the risk. For the disincentive  resulting  from  the  need  to  put  out,  over  time,  ever  greater amounts  of  fixed  capital  has  been  more  than  compensated  by  the profit incentives of technical innovation (as well as potential negative sanctions that could result from failure to stay ahead of one's competitors).  Simply  put:  the  increased  potential  rate  of  return  from  investments in innovations has, sooner or later, more than counterbalanced the increased degree of risk.

The  classic  case  is,  of  course,  the  industrial  revolution  itself,  which amounted to the transition from domestic putting-out manufacture to the  factory  system.  This  required  entrepreneurs  to  move  from  a system  based  almost  entirely  on  circulating  capital-where  the capitalist  supplied  raw  materials  and  wages  (or  credit)  to  workers who  possessed  the  means  of  production-to  a  system  based  heavily on  fixed  capital  in  which  the  capitalist  owned  increasingly  substantial  assets  in  plant  and  equipment  (buildings  and  machinery).  The need  for  a  radically  increased  commitment  to  fixed  capital  assets did  unquestionably  constitute  a  significant  initial  disincentive  to eighteenth-century British entrepreneurs, accustomed as they were to short-term investments in production where the direct producers bore most of the risk (and particularly of the losses from cyclical downturns in  the  market).  Nevertheless,  it  took  place,  for  example,  in  cotton manufacturing,  with  the  rise  of  the  factory.  Nor  did  the  increased risks  bound  up  with  fixed-capital  requirements  prove  more  than  a relative  barrier  to  investment  during  the  subsequent  epoch  of  the power loom, the steam engine, the railroad, and so on. From the very first  stages  of  industrialization,  capitalism  showed  itself  capable  of overcoming barriers to investment in fixed capital to the extent that such investment could yield greater profits, and thus of developing on the basis of relative surplus-value. Indeed, the common-sense assumption  of  the  most  diverse  currents  of  economic  theory  is  that inter-firm competition requiring cost-cutting and profit maximization has  been the central  mechanism  behind  capitalist  innovation  and  the key  to  capitalism's  unique  capacity  systematically  to  develop  the productive forces.

It  needs  finally  to  be  emphasized  that  capitalist  entrepreneurs  have constantly  transformed  capitalist  institutions  precisely  in  order  to cope with the growing requirements of fixed capital investment. This is, in a very general sense, what the Regulationists are arguing. However, they see such institutional innovation as associated with, indeed dependent upon, a qualitative  economy-wide  institutional  transformation that made for a qualitative break in capitalist evolution beyond the  initial  phase  of  merely  extensive  accumulation  governed  by  competitive  regulation  to  a  new  mode  of  development,  rather  than  as inherent  in  the  system  of  capitalist  social-property  relations  itself. Institutional  transformation  to  facilitate  technical  change  should  be seen  as  an  evolutionary  feature  of  capitalist  manufacturing  per  se, rather analogous to, and running parallel with, the process of technical

change  itself-and,  like  technical  change,  arising  from  a  field  of natural  selection  characterized  by  cost-cutting  competition  between firms.  As  a  result  of  such  innovation,  capitalist  economic  history  has witnessed one institutional advance after another-joint  stock companies,  limited  partnerships,  corporations,  regulated  banks, bankruptcy  laws,  vertical  integration,  horizontal  integration  in  conglomerates-as  requirements  have  increased  for  the  mobilization  of capital,  the  time  horizon  for  investment,  the  control  over  the  investment environment, and so forth.

It  is  true  that  institutions  have  hardly  evolved  continuously  or  automatically,  but  neither  has  productive  technique.  The  point  is  simply that institutional changes needed, at successive points, to facilitate the fixed  capital  investment  for  technical  change  can  and  have  taken place,  throughout  the  history  of  capitalism,  as  has  technical  change itself,  in  a  piecemeal  and  local  fashion-expressing  the  initiative  of individual capitalists, or groups of capitalists, sometimes aided by the state.  In  order  to  show  why  such  institutional  innovations  should  be excluded from their putative long phase of extensive accumulation, or why  they  should  have  had  to  await  some  all-at-once  transition  from extensive  to  intensive  accumulation,  the  Regulationists  would  have had to demonstrate that the institutions constituting the competitive mode  of  regulation  somehow  had  the  effect  of  putting  a  damper  on institutional changes. And this they have not been able to do. In the end, the Regulationists have not only failed adequately to demonstrate why intense  competition  between  decentralized  firms  would  actually have  restricted  fixed  capital  investment  for  technical  change;  they have similarly failed  to  show  that  the  system  did  not,  from  the  start and more or less regularly (though, again, not continuously), actually improve  its  institutions  for  making  such  investments  within  the broader competitive environment.

## Craft Control, Fixed Capital Investment and Technical Change

There  is  no  reason  to  deny  that  workers'  resistance  has  constituted  a fetter on the placement of fixed capital embodying technical advances, more or less  powerful  according  to  historical  circumstances;  nor  that skilled workers have sought to make use of their relative scarcity and their relative indispensability for management  within  the  labour process  to  organize  their  self-defence  against  capital,  and  specifically against the introduction of machinery requiring labour of lower specific weight. Yet, it is very difficult to understand how the Regulationists  can  move  from  propositions  of  this  general  sort  to  the  assertion that  control  over  the  labour  process  exerted  by  craft  workers  constituted  an  institutionally  founded  barrier  of  sufficient  solidity  and breadth to structure an extensive regime of capital accumulation, one which,  in  their  account,  was  mostly  restricted  to  the  extraction  of absolute surplus-value, over an entire historical epoch.

At the heart of the Regulationist argument is the view that the rise of scientific management  or  Taylorism-Fordism-in  association  with the  rise  of  the  corporation  and  oligopoly-constituted  a  moment  of discontinuity  in  the  development  of  mechanization,  deskilling  and

capitalist control over the labour process that was sufficiently sharp to mark-indeed  partially  to  bring  about-the  transition  from  one regime of accumulation to the next. In Lipietz's words,

The 1848-1914 period is mainly characterized . . . by a simple extension of productive capacity without a dramatic change in the organic composition or in productivity . . . In the twenties a revolution in the mode of organization of work was generalized in the United States and partially in Europe: Taylorism. It  consisted  of  an  expropriation,  by  a  gigantic  and  capillary deepening of the capitalist control of the labour process, of the know-how of the collective workers, a know-how which was henceforth systematized by  engineers  and  technicians  according  to  the  methods  of  the  'scientific management of work'. A further step was the incorporation of this knowhow into the automatic system of machines, which dictated the method of work to the workers who had thus been robbed of initiative: such was the productive watershed of 'Fordism'. 21

It  is  difficult  to  know  just  what  to  make  of  this  argument,  which  is essential to the Regulationists' attempt to specify institutional foundations for distinctive regimes of accumulation, but which seems to fly in  the  face  of  the  ABC of  capitalist  development.  The  Regulationists seem to be attributing to class conflict over control of the labour process a radical autonomy from, and a determinative role in, the process of  capital  accumulation.  On  that  basis,  a  qualitative,  once-and-for-all transformation  in  the  balance  of  class  forces  and  the  nature  of  technical  change is  supposed to have occurred at the time of the TaylorFord revolution, enabling an epochal break to accumulation predominantly  on  the  basis  of  relative  surplus-value.  It  is  as  if  craft  control -or,  more  broadly,  control  exerted  by  skilled  workers-was,  with respect to the accumulation of capital, all-powerful before, and obliterated after, the advent of Taylor and Ford. But such an extreme and discontinuous  account  of  the  development  of  control  over  the  labour process would appear impossible to sustain.

The Regulationists appear largely to ignore the general fact that ever since  the  Industrial  Revolution,  if  not  before,  the  capitalist  labour process  has  been  transformed  and  re-transformed  through  new  techniques  that  have  brought  greater  profitability  to  individual  firms  by providing  greater  efficiency  (greater  outputs  for  given  inputs),  not merely by-and often irrespective of-eliciting more intense or more protracted  labour  inputs.  Capitalist  entrepreneurs,  seeking  to  stay  in business, were driven to adopt these techniques because they cut unit costs (without requiring greater exploitation, although they of course often facilitated it). 22 Workers might, on occasion, succeed in limiting

the  introduction  of  such  techniques,  in  a  given  industry  in  a  given locale, sometimes for a significant period; but they could not in principle-and certainly not indefinitely-do so over the entire breadth of a  manufacturing  economy.  Once  one  or  a  few  firms  in  an  industry adopted  the  more  efficient  technique,  others  would  have  to  follow or  go  out  of  business,  and  there  was  little  workers  could  do.  From this  vantage  point,  although  the  process  of  technological  change  is incomprehensible  in  abstraction  from  class  struggle  over  the  labour process,  it  is  quite  wrong  to  believe  that  workers'  shopfloor  control, expressing  workers'  class  power,  could  come  close  to  limiting  fixed capital investment and technical change over the sort of major epoch defined  by  the  Regulationists  as  characterized  by  predominantly extensive accumulation.

Long  before  the era of Taylorist-Fordist transformations, new machines,  representing  enormous  advances  in  productive  efficiency, had been more or less regularly-though certainly not continuallycoming into use. For the reasons we have seen, skilled workers could not systematically, or over any length of time, prevent the accompanying  series  of  gigantic  transformations  of  the  labour  process-changes that  resulted  in  massive  devaluations  of  handicraft  skill,  significant intensification  of  labour,  and  major  reductions  of  workers'  job  control.  In  one  famous  formulation,  'As  long  as  machine  production expands in a given branch of industry at the expense of the old handicrafts  or  of  manufacture,  the  result  is  as  certain  as  is  the  result  of  an encounter  between  an  army  with  breach-loading  rifles  and  one  with bows and arrows.' What else are we to make of the initial industrial revolution  in  cotton,  with  its  world-historical  cutting  of  production costs and its devastating destruction of artisanal labour? How else are we  to  understand  Marx's  analysis  of  'Machinofacture'  in Capital (published  in 1867 ),  which  theorizes  already-accomplished  (though necessarily  incomplete)  processes  of  destruction  of  handicraft  labour, subordination of workers to machines, and intensification of labour  that  were  the  consequence  of  the  introduction  of  cost-cutting machinery and were every bit as spectacular as-and in many respects quite analogous to-the processes that occurred under the impetus of Taylorism-Fordism? The upshot is that  the  major  transformations  of the  labour  process  that  took  place  in  United  States  manufacturing from  the  late  nineteenth  century  are  incomprehensible  if  they  are conceived  as  a  transition  from  one  to  another  regime  of  capital accumulation. On the contrary, they represented a further phase of an ongoing,  though  hardly  continuous,  evolution.  And,  as  with  earlier phases,  they  in  part  reflected  an  independent  technological  dynamic whose  results  were,  in  many  cases,  in  no  significant  way  conditional upon  capital's  previous  success  in  assaulting  the  bastions  of  skilled

workers'  control,  but  which  nonetheless  had  the  effect  of  radically undermining those bastions. 23

Furthermore,  precisely  because  the  introduction  of  machinery  is  not merely about the eliciting of increased worker inputs, but quite often centrally  about  increases  in  efficiency,  whatever  their  consequence  for labour  inputs,  mechanization  often  brings  with  it  a  requirement  for new skills  and  thereby  even  the  potential  for  a  certain  weakening  of managerial control.  The  capitalist  mode  of  production  does  possess  a systematic  tendency  or  bias  toward  embodying  increases  in  productive  power,  technical  advances,  in  machinery  rather  than  in  human beings, all else being equal. This is because, given free labour, capitalists find it hard to insure that they will secure the gains from investments  in  'human  capital':  workers  may  move  to  another  firm.  It  is also  because  skilled  workers  are,  as  a  rule,  more  difficult  to  exploit. But the fact that machine-using technical changes are much to be preferred  to  skill-using  technical  changes  of  the  same  level  of  efficiency will  not  prevent  capitalists  from  bringing  in  inventions  which  may even  increase  the  use  of  skilled  labour  (especially  at  the  start),  if  so doing will yield a higher rate of profit. In any case, the mechanization processes  of  the  Taylor/Ford  era,  with  their  accompanying  transformations  in  the  labour  process,  both  destroyed  skills  born  out  of  earlier

The  Regulationists  seem  to  draw  directly  on  Braverman,  who  precedes  them  in focusing  almost  exclusively  on  the  Taylorist-Fordist  initiatives  of 1890 to 1930 ,  in attributing  these  (in  a  manner  that  is  not  entirely  clear)  to  the  rise  of  'monopoly capital', in neglecting the previous, extensive revolutions in the labour process, and in offering little analysis of the relationship of the development of science and technology to the transformation of production and productiveness. See H. Braverman, Labor and Monopoly Capital , New York 1974 . We have been much helped by, and wish to express our  indebtedness  to,  T.  Elger,  'Valorisation  and  'Deskilling':  A  Critique  of  Braverman', Capital and Class , Spring 1979 . For the destruction of skills that had given craft workers  extensive  control  over  the  labour  process,  and  the  subsequent  emergence  of skills  of  a  rather  different  sort  during  the  nineteenth  century,  see  G.  Stedman-Jones, 'Class Struggle and the Industrial Revolution', NLR 90 , March-April 1975 , p. 37 .

Finally,  to  avoid  misunderstanding,  we  should  state,  very  explicitly,  that  we  in  no way  wish  to  substitute  a  misleading-and  unduly  pessimistic-notion  of  infinite  or perfect capitalist flexibility for the Regulationists' misleading notion of craft control as capable of constituting a qualitative barrier to technical advance sufficient to establish (in  connection  with  a  few  other  institutional  forms)  a  distinct  phase  of  (extensive) accumulation. Obviously, in many cases, the geographical scope for successful investment  in  given  technical  changes  is  significantly  restricted,  for  technical,  social  and other  reasons.  As  a  result,  groups  of  workers  can,  of  course,  for  greater  or  lesser periods, prevent the introduction of new techniques (as well as defend other aspects of their  position).  Much  clearly  depends  on  the  specific  potentials  for  competition  from other regions or nations.

mechanization  and  themselves  called  into  being  new  skills.  'Skilled workers'-a term of such elasticity as to stretch from handicraftsmen to the semi-skilled operatives of some modern factories-were neither so  central  to  the  labour  process  before  the  Taylorist-Fordist  revolution, nor so totally peripheral after it, to have constituted the focus for the  transition  to  intensive  accumulation.  As  a  central  institution  of the competitive mode of regulation, the pre-Taylorist 'craft-controlled' labour process cannot do the work of structuring 'extensive accumulation' that is required of it by the Theory of Regulation.

## From Competitive Regulation to Restricted Consumption?

Let us now move from the Regulationists' account of the supply side to their more central theses about the two ways in which competitive regulation fettered the growth of consumer demand: first, the depressing effect of the precapitalist environment and of unregulated capitallabour  relations  on  the  potential  growth  of  wages  and  aggregate consumption;  second,  the  restrictive  effect  of  the  limited  growth  of mass consumption on the growth of mass production.

The  Regulationists  advance  the  notion  of  an  epoch  of  accumulation where workers' real wages were prevented from rising and mass consumption  stagnated.  They  ascribe  these  effects  to:  (i)  workers'  access to the means of subsistence through direct links to households and villages  of  the  precapitalist  countryside;  (ii)  the  oversupply  of  labour resulting  from  wave  upon  wave  of  immigration  from  largely  noncapitalist  rural  areas,  both  at  home  and  from  abroad;  and  (iii)  the highly competitive, unregulated character of the labour market. Let us consider these factors in turn.

## (i) Workers with Non-Market Access to the Means of Consumption

The Regulationists' paradoxical notion of a phase of fully established capitalism  in  which  labour-power  still  retains  possession  of,  or  nonmarket  access  to,  the  means  of  subsistence  is,  it  must  be  said,  especially puzzling, and, at the very least, needs much further elaboration. First, from a purely empirical point of view, there is no evidence that a  significant  proportion  of  farmers,  let  alone  industrial  workers,  had direct non-market access to the means of subsistence in the capitalist United States, outside the South, during the second half of the nineteenth century. 24 We shall return to this point below. Moreover, even if  this  idea  had  greater  purchase  historically,  its  theoretical  justification,  and  status  within  Regulation  Theory,  would  remain  extremely unclear. Aglietta rightly argues that the creation and expansion of the wage-earning class takes place through 'a double structural change: [ 1 ] a  separation  between  labour-power  and  means  of  production,  which are combined solely in the labour process under the authority off capital,  and . . . [ 2 ]  the  separation of labour-power from all its conditions

of  existence'  (subsistence/consumption).  Yet,  from  this  premiss  he concludes  that  'there  is  no  reason  why  the  two  components  of  this dual structural change should occur together', and that there are good grounds for expecting capitalist development initially to take place by way of [ 1 ]  without the occurrence of [ 2 ],  so  that  labour  retains  nonmarket access to its means of subsistence. 25 This is mystifying indeed.

Most  obviously,  the  very  fact  of  proletarianization  would  seem  to imply  a  process  by  which  the  direct  producers  have  been,  or  are being, separated from the means of subsistence. If [ 2 ],  the  process  of depriving the direct producers of their subsistence land and tools, has not taken place, how can [ 1 ], the process of their subjection as wagelabour  to  the  domination  of  capital  within  the  labour  process,  be made  to  occur?  It  is  only  workers'  lack  of  means  of  subsistence, and  their  consequent  need  to  buy  on  the  market,  which  compels them  to  sell  their  labour-power  and  submit  to  the  exploitation  of capital.  On  the  other  hand,  if  workers  have  been  made  subject  to the  authority  of  capital  in  the  labour  process,  it  would,  under  normal  conditions,  seem  difficult  for  them  just  in  practical  terms  to secure  their  means  of  consumption  from  agricultural  households  and plots in rural communities.

Suppose one admits, for the sake of argument, a workforce which subjects  itself  to  the  capitalist  manufacturing  labour  process  yet  cannot constitute  a  mass  market  because  of  its  direct  non-market  access  to the  means  of  subsistence.  How,  under  these  conditions,  could  there exist an adequate basis for ongoing capital accumulation? One would have the very odd economy in which capitalists produce machines for other capitalists with little or no final outlet in consumer goods-an economy composed entirely of Department I, in which capitalists are figuratively  eating  one  another's  machines.  This  seems  to  be  something  like  the  economy  that  Aglietta  and  the  Regulationists  posit within  the  historical-institutional  framework  of  competitive  regulation. But it seems at best a logically conceivable construct with little practical applicability to cases where capitalism has established itself.

Aglietta and the Regulationists may have in mind neither fully capitalist  cases,  nor  situations  in  which  producers  retain  full  possession  of the means of subsistence. They may rather be referring to situations in which  peasants  have  partially  lost  their  land  and  tools  and  are  thus obliged  to  do  some  work  for  a  wage,  but  have  not  yet  become  fully dependent  upon  capital.  (It  must  be  said  that  it  is  far  from  certain that this is what they have in mind, for they refer to a situation where labour is subject to the authority of capital in the labour process, and in Aglietta's exemplary case of the United States the countryside was primarily  composed  of  neither  peasants  nor  wage-labourers,  but owner-operator  farmer  capitalists.)  One  can  thus  conceptualize  and refer  to  a  multitude  of  cases,  historically  and  in  the  present,  where producers,  namely  peasants-in  consequence  of  population  growth and the subdivision of holdings, the growth of taxation, or other such processes-found  themselves  with  insufficient  land  and  tools  for

subsistence  and  were  thus  obliged  to  sell  some  of  their  labour-power on the market to merchant manufacturers to make ends meet.

In such cases, it is quite reasonable to expect that the path of capital accumulation  might  be  constricted  indeed.  Capitalists  would  normally  find  it  extremely  difficult  to  organize  labour  under  their  own rule  within  the  factory-to  bring  about  the  real  as  opposed  to  the merely  formal  subjection  of  labour  to  capital.  They  would  likely  be obliged to organize production on the basis of the household, that is, putting out. Indeed, capitalists would prefer this form, if the relatively low  wages  for  peasant  manufacturing  workers  in  comparison  with urban  proletarians  offset  the  losses  that  would  accrue  from  the  relatively  low  industrial  productivity  of  peasant  households  in  comparison with factory production. The upshot would certainly be a strong tendency  to  merely  extensive  accumulation. 26 At  the  same  time,  in line  with  the  Regulationist  emphasis,  one  could  surely  expect  severe restrictions  on  the  home  market  where  manufacturing  was  organized on the basis of semi-proletarianized peasants: with producers directly producing  a  significant  part  of  their  subsistence  bundle,  they  would offer only limited demand.

Nevertheless, it is not easy to see how reference to mechanisms of this sort fits in with, or supports, the Regulationist project of showing that emergent  networks  of  capitalist  institutions  (modes  of  regulation) were  responsible  for  historically  varying  modes  of  capitalist  development.  For  the  sources  of  the  posited  restriction  on  accumulation  are not  historically  specific capitalist  institutions , representing  a  variation upon capitalist social-property relations; they are instead precapitalist social-property  relations  and  the  possibilities  and  limits  that  these impose  upon  the  direct  peasant  producers.  By  the  same  token,  since such  precapitalist  social-property  systems  cannot  simply  be  assumed to frame early capitalist development-they may or may not exist-in what  meaningful  sense  can  they  be  thought  to  make  for  an  integral phase or mode of development in the evolution of capitalism?

## (ii) An Oversupply of Labour from the Precapitalist Countryside

The Regulationists point to immigration from non-capitalist regions, both  internal  and  external,  as  a  further  element  of  the  competitive mode of regulation  that  gave  rise  to  limited  mass  consumption.  But this would appear to raise problems similar to those we have just been discussing.  No  doubt,  manufacturing  capitalism  has  often  initially developed  within,  and  secured  its  labour  force  from,  precapitalist agrarian  societies  or  such  societies  in  transition  to  capitalism.  No doubt, in so far as the rise of manufacturing capitalism is accompanied by processes of so-called primitive accumulation leading to the expulsion of agriculturalists from the land, or takes place within an environment  in  which  widespread  rural  impoverishment  allows  for  the

easy  attraction  of  agricultural  labour  to  industry,  the  growth  of  the supply  of  labour  will  exert  a  downward  pressure  on  wages.  But  on what basis can the Regulationists simply take it for granted that such conditions  centrally  define  and  determine  a  first  capitalist  mode  of development  marked  by  extensive  accumulation,  with  its  restricted wages  and  mass  consumption,  when  these  conditions  are  both  external to the institutions of capitalism itself (though not of course to the process  of  development)  and  historically  contingent  upon  socioeconomic arrangements in the countryside at the time of industrialization?

It  remains,  further,  an  open  question,  even  where  processes  of  socalled  primitive  accumulation  are  separating  an  agrarian  population from  the  means  of  production  and  subsistence,  whether  and  to  what degree  it  will  actually  be  available  for  manufacturing.  Agricultural sectors  based  on  intensive  forms  of  husbandry  have,  in  some  cases, proved  a  potent  competitor  for  labour.  And  agrarian  capitalism  has, in certain critical instances, developed without-or with only the very slow-separation  of  the  agrarian  producers  from  the  means  of  production,  that  is,  on  the  basis  of  owner-operator  commercial  farmers. In  such  instances,  the  rise  of  capitalist  agriculture  may  bring  about not  a  plethora  but  a  paucity  of  labour,  pressure  for  high  rather  than low  wages  in  manufacturing.  That  this  is  not  merely  a  conceptual possibility is, of course, evident from Aglietta's exemplary case of the United States.

Precapitalist  agrarian  structures  and  their  dissolution  can,  of  course, in certain circumstances, supply vast pools of labour that exert downward pressure on wages. But to assert this, it would seem, is to do no more than identify one historical possibility, rather than to supply the premiss for the initial phase, or mode of development, posited in the Regulationist schema. Equally to the point, the mechanism that is here invoked to account for the restriction of capitalist growth to extensive accumulation  is  located,  in  decisive  respects,  outside  the  confines  of the capitalist mode of production per se. It is thus not at all clear how it meshes with-or exemplifies-the Regulationist project of demonstrating  the  way  in  which  historically  specific  regimes  of  capital accumulation  need  to  be  understood  in  terms  of  historically  specific networks of properly capitalist institutions.

## (iii) An Unregulated Labour Market

While the unorganized, unregulated labour market of the competitive mode of regulation-made that much less controllable by the working class  in  consequence  of  massive  immigration-will  tend  greatly  to facilitate  capitalist  exploitation  of  wage  labour,  it  cannot  simply  be assumed  to  cancel  out-any  more  than  can  the  existence  of  a  large supply of labour-the powerful mechanisms for pushing up workingclass consumption that are built into the normal processes of competition and capitalist accumulation over the medium term. Indeed, it has seemed a commonplace that relatively extended or long waves of capital accumulation-such  as  were  encompassed  by  the  Regulationists'  first  mode  of  development-create  inexorable  upward  pressures on  both  aggregate  consumption  and  the  real  wage,  pressures  which, for  some  reason,  the  Regulationists,  in  their  discussion  of  extensive

accumulation,  basically  ignore.  Aggregate  consumption  increases simply because the investment of surpluses entails the employment of additional waged workers. 27 The level of wages tends to rise in consequence of rising demand for labour. Moreover, more efficient capitalist  producers  are  obliged  to  bid  up  wages  in  order  to  compete  with other firms for the additional workers they need to expand their share of  the  market. 28 It  was  precisely  the  pressures  of  attracting,  keeping and  disciplining  a  fast-growing  labour  force  for  his  low-cost  automobiles that led Henry Ford to offer his famous $ 5per-day wage.

Since  these  mechanisms  could  be  just  as  powerful  in  the  earliest phases of capital  accumulation as later on-and tend to operate even in highly repressive political environments-there seems little justification for positing, without much further argument, that their effects were  offset by  intra-working-class  competition  and  immigration throughout  the  first  mode  of  development.  What  appears  to  be  at issue is the Regulationists' elevation of a counter-tendency to an absolute, determining feature of a whole epoch of economic history.

## From  Restricted  Mass  Consumption  to  Limited  Mass  Production?

Finally, even if it were granted that the institutions defining competitive regulation  and  extensive  accumulation  depressed  aggregate working-class demand, it would still be necessary to challenge the further  notion-perhaps  the  conceptual  linchpin  of  the  Regulationists' general  schema  of  stages  in  which  historically  specific  modes  of  consumption  play  a  defining  role-that  the  rise  of  mass  production required,  or  was  prevented  in  the  absence  of,  the  autonomous  rise  of mass consumption. This proposition seems to depend on the assumption that accumulation  was  taking  place  primarily  through  the methods  of  extending  absolute  surplus-value,  and  that  workers  were deriving  their  subsistence  outside  the  sphere  of  commodity  production. More directly, however, it appears to derive from Aglietta's conception of capital  accumulation as tending to take place through the 'uneven development of Department I'. In his view, technical change generally  arises  in  Department  I producing means of production and calls  forth  increased  investment  in  that  Department  by  capitalists anxious  to  profit from  technological  rents.  Nevertheless,  because workers'  consumption  is  restricted  under  competitive  regulation  and extensive accumulation, and because few links of exchange tie Department  I to  Department  II producing  the  means  of  consumption,  the increase  and  cheapening  of  the  output  of  Department  I that  results from added investment in the new technique are prevented from calling forth a compensatory expansion of Department II. The outcome is a  tendency  to  overproduction  leading  to  a  sharp  fall  in  prices  and  a disruption of accumulation in Department I.

There  are  a  number  of  problems  with  this  argument.  Leaving  aside

the  limiting,  and  historically  almost  inconceivable,  case  of  a  capitalism  in  which  consumer  goods  are  not  at  all  commoditized-so  that Department  II does  not  effectively  exist-it  is  difficult  to  see  why  a significant part of the innovative activity taking place in Department I will  not  result,  almost  inevitably,  in  capital  goods  aimed  for  use  in Department  II.  That  is,  the  mere  fact  that  a  technical  change  may formally originate in Department I-say, with a new tool produced in a  machine  shop-does  not  at  all  mean  that  its  motivation  did  not come from, or that its effects were not most profoundly felt in, Department II. Capitalists are, as a rule, obliged to adopt any technique that will reduce the cost of production for a commodity; this is no less true of  capitalists  in  Department  II than in  Department  I;  cheaper  capital goods that originate in Department I will thus be broadly adopted by Department  II for  the  production  of  consumer  goods;  the  reduced price will increase the size of the population able to buy the commodity, so that unless employment and/or nominal wages actually fall, the market for this good will inevitably grow as a result of its cheapness. The Regulationists go to rather extreme lengths to ignore (or even to deny) this fundamental tendency. 29 Yet it  appears  obvious  that,  since the  origins  of  capitalism,  the  fundamental  way  in  which  products have  become  mass-consumption  commodities  has  been  as  a  result of  changed  conditions  of  supply  leading  to  a  reduction  in  price; 30 and  that  changes  in  the  conditions  of  consumer-goods  supply  have regularly  originated  with  new  machines  produced  in  Department I. 31 It  has  therefore  seemed  an  elementary  empirical  generalization that,  for  the  history  of  capitalism,  the  rise  of  mass  production  does not  require,  but  rather  issues  in,  mass  consumption-that  the  latter has depended upon the former, even though, in some important ways, facilitating it.

## 3. Extensive Accumulation, Competitive Regulation and US Economic History

The  criticisms  in  the  previous  sections,  if  sustainable,  would  appear to cast grave doubt upon the whole Regulationist account of the first 'mode  of  development'.  To  the  extent  that  the  Regulationists  have adduced  mechanisms  that  could,  in  theory,  constitute  fetters  on

production that might yield a pattern of extensive accumulation, these rely  on  the  effects  of  peasant-dominated  precapitalist  social-property relations. To the extent that they have referred to mechanisms arising from  properly  capitalist  institutional  forms  to  account  for  extensive accumulation,  they  have  failed  to  explain  why  these  should  be expected to outweigh the effects of processes built into the functioning of  capitalist  social  property  relations  per  se.  The  upshot  is  that  the Regulationists have given us no reason why the capitalist institutions they define as constituting the competitive mode of regulation should actually issue in anything but intensive accumulation.

We now need to look more closely at the historical case which Aglietta and other  Regulationists  take  to  be  emblematic  of  a  regime  of  extensive accumulation governed by the competitive mode of regulation: namely, the US economy in the second half of the nineteenth century. For ultimately it is upon its capacity to grasp the actual economic history of capitalism  that  the  usefulness  of  their  conceptualization  will  depend.

## Relative Surplus Value and the Growth of Working-Class Demand

The  first  question  to  be  asked  is  whether  the  US economy  that  the Regulationists  portray-one  structured  by  craft  control,  a  multitude of  competing  firms  and  a  competitive  labour  market-discouraged the  allocation  of  funds  to  the  high-risk  investments  in  fixed  capital required  for  innovation  and  the  lowest-cost  production.  There  seems little evidence that such investment was discouraged or that productivity growth was thus restricted.

According to Maddison, gross fixed non-residential investment as a proportion of GNP in the US fluctuated between 12 per cent and 15 per cent in the years from 1871 to 1914 , while the average annual rate of growth of non-residential fixed capital stock in the same period was 4 1 . per cent. These are impressive figures by any standard, and should be compared, respectively, with the 6 per cent and 1 4 . per cent achieved in the same period by the United Kingdom, an economy that must certainly have been experiencing intensive and not extensive accumulation. 32

Kendrick provides the following tabulation  for  the  growth  of  manufacturing productivity in the US between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of World War I:

The rate of growth of labour productivity in the period before World War I seems to have been somewhat lower than that achieved in the post-World War II boom. (See Table V below, p. 95 .) Nevertheless, it can  hardly  be  said  that  productivity  stagnated;  nor  can  one  possibly account  for  the  steady  growth  of  productivity  over  such  an  extended period in terms of the intensification of labour. Equally important, we can find no long-term trend toward the slowing down of productivity growth at any point in the period between 1850 and the First World War, such as one would expect if development had been taking place, after a certain point, on the basis of an effectively given, or only very slowly growing, level of development of the productive forces. Such a trend is implied by Boyer's idea, noted above, of a 'semi-stagnation of productivity'  at  the  end  of  the  phase  of  extended  accumulation,  but this  idea  has  no  empirical  counterpart  in  US economic  development before World War I.

Thus,  the  actual  pattern  of  long-term  productivity  growth  in  this period clearly contradicts the Regulationist contention that the foundations  of  economic  growth  were  largely  confined  to  the  methods  of increasing  absolute  surplus-value.  In  reality,  the  increase  of  relative surplus-value  leading  to  intensive  accumulation  was  a  central  and defining  aspect  of  the  development  process  in  this  epoch,  as  should not be surprising given the predominance in the post-bellum United States of a rather pure form of capitalist social-property relations.

The  fact  that  the  growth  of  labour  productivity  was  a  characteristic feature  of  economic  development  is  itself  evidence  that  the  economy offered ample potential for the growth of real wages. Indeed, productivity growth created a tendency toward-although it could not completely  determine-rising  real  wages,  for  the  obvious  reason  that  it meant  lower-cost  production  and,  under  competitive  conditions,  all else  equal,  downward  pressures  on  the  prices  of  commodities  that entered into workers' subsistence bundle. Between 1864 and 1880 , the

consumer price index fell  from 180 to 110 ,  although  in  so  doing,  it reached  levels  no  lower  than  had  obtained  in  the  mid 1850 s.  From 1880 to 1900 , the price level fell significantly further, from 110 to 95 33 . Thus, in order to secure quite significant increases in their real wages, workers had only to prevent their nominal wages from falling as fast as commodity prices.

In fact, after stagnating during the depression of the 1870 s, real wages grew by about 75 per cent between 1880 and 1914 34 . It is true that, in the period immediately prior to World War I, the flood tide of immigration  did  result  in  keeping  the  growth  of  real  wages  somewhat below the growth of labour productivity, but even that is hardly the same  as  saying  that  real  wages  stagnated.  As  Rees  concludes,  hourly wages  in  manufacturing  grew  by  an  annual  average  of 1 3 . per  cent between 1889 and 1913 ,  as compared with an average increase of 2 1 . per  cent  in  output  per  'production-worker  manhour  in  the  same period. (It should be recalled in passing that 1 3 . per cent p.a. was also the  average  increase  in  this  period  for  output  per  weighted  unit  of labour  and  capital  input  combined. 35 )  Moreover,  during  the  period from 1880 to 1914 as a whole, while the real wage was growing by 75 per cent, the labour productivity index in manufacturing was growing only slightly faster, by 83 per cent. 36 If we begin the period at the end of  the  Civil  War,  then  wages  probably  actually  rose  as  a  share  of  the

total  product. 37 Reliable  data  on  the  share  of  consumption  (versus investment)  in  GNP are  available  only  from 1890 ,  but  between  then and  the  outbreak  of  World  War  I  it  maintained  a  level  equal  to  or higher than at any date after 1950 . (See Figure VI below, p. 95 .)

## US Economic Growth, 1850 -1914 : Classical Capitalist Development

The fact is, then, that the pattern of US economic growth in the period from roughly 1850 to 1914 could hardly have diverged more decisively from the Regulationists' first mode of development, in which growth primarily rests upon  increased exploitation of labour, sharply restricted  productivity  increases,  and  geographical  expansion  of  the system. No doubt the US capitalist economy, after the Civil War, did very significantly intensify the exploitation of labour and did dramatically extend  its  geographical  reach.  Nevertheless,  economic  development followed what might be termed a classically capitalist path of development, conforming to what the Regulationists misleadingly call intensive accumulation, not extensive accumulation. Powered by competition among  many  firms,  it  achieved  dramatic  increases  in  mechanization leading  to  rising  productivity,  rising  real  wages,  and  the  explosive expansion  of  the  most  dynamic  home  market  in  the  world  at  that time. This is evident not only in the aggregate figures for manufacturing  productivity  and  wages  already  noted,  but  also  in  a  more  disaggregated view of the basic contours and trends in the US economy.

At the core of growth was an agricultural revolution. Starting in the middle  of  the  century,  and  aided  by  the  completion  in 1869 of  the transcontinental  railroad,  agriculture  underwent  a  spectacular  process  of  modernization.  The  social  basis,  as  Aglietta  emphasizes,  was provided  by  owner-operator  family  farmers,  not  of  course  peasants. Their economic  activities, so pivotal for capital accumulation throughout  the  nineteenth  century,  explode  almost  every  one  of  the Regulationists'  attempts  to  define  competitive  regulation  and  extensive  accumulation.  Far  from  being  subject  to  the  capitalist  labour process in their production but independent from the market in their consumption-the  labour  force  envisioned  in  the  Regulationists' ideal-typical first mode of development-these agricultural producers still retained  significant  means  of  production  and  control  of  the labour process but were, from the 1820 s  or  so,  by  and  large  marketdependent  for  their  means  of  subsistence.  The  fact  that  even  most farmers,  not  to  mention  manufacturing  workers,  bought  their  means of consumption on the market makes a mockery of the Regulationists' idea  that  in  their  first  period  of  development  in  the  United  States workers derived their subsistence from outside the sphere of capitalist commodity  production.  Precisely  because  of  their  market  dependence, US farmers as individuals had little choice but to purchase more advanced  machinery  from  the  capital-goods  sector,  so  as  to  cut  costs and compete on their output markets. This in itself calls sharply into question the Regulationist view of an economy unable to accumulate by the methods of increasing relative surplus-value or to develop mass

production  through  capital  investment  in  Department  II,  for  food production is of course the consumer-goods sector par excellence .

Furthermore,  the  central  role  of  owner-operator  family  farmers,  who largely  held  their  place  in  the  economy  by  producing  at  the  socially necessary  rate, meant  that  agriculture  could  only  with  difficulty supply a sufficient labour force for the rise of manufacture. The result was  a  long-term  tendency  not  to  depress  wages  but,  in  connection with other factors, to support wages at the world's highest levels. The growth of agricultural productivity thus combined with the growth of wages  to  boost  the  working  class's  discretionary  purchasing  power and  thereby  working-class  demand  for  a  whole  range  of  non-food consumer  goods.  At  the  same  time,  demand  from  the  agricultural sector  stoked  the  machine-tool  branch  directly  and  the  capital-goods sector more generally, while farmers' growing income helped buttress the  demand  for  household  implements  and  the  market  in  consumer goods as a whole. Finally, high wages stimulated cost-cutting technical change-and  hence  the  demand  for  capital  goods-by  encouraging the  substitution  of  relatively  cheap  capital  for  relatively  expensive labour in production. 38

The  dynamic  growth  of  agricultural  production  and  agricultural productivity  stimulated,  and  was  made  possible  by,  the  growth  of mechanization,  which  was  itself  dependent  upon  the  expansion  and transformation,  upstream,  of  the  machine-tool  industry.  Output  per worker in agriculture tripled between 1840 and 1911 , with 60 per cent of the increase due to mechanization and 70 per cent of that attributable  to  two  epoch-making  inventions-the  reaper  and  the  thresher. Demand for agricultural implements was, in turn, heavily responsible for  the  impressive  growth  and  transformation  of  the  iron  and  steel industry. 39 On  the  other  hand,  the  growth  of  agricultural  output provided  the  materials,  downstream,  for  a  whole  series  of  modern mechanized  industries  in  food  processing-milling  of  flour,  meatpacking,  distilling,  and  the  like.  Aglietta  notes  the  significance  of these  industries,  but  quite  wrongly  postdates  their  appearance  to  the 1890 s. In fact, they had begun to work their powerful transformative effects by the Civil War, if not earlier. 40

The  spectacular  expansion  and  transformation  of  the  US productive economy  ultimately  rested  upon  a  distinctive  capital-goods  sector, with a modern core producing highly specialized dedicated machines. Perhaps the characteristic feature of the new technology was the introduction  of  interchangeable  parts,  which  were  themselves  dependent upon  a  new  capacity  for  precision  and  standardized  production. Essential to the process was of course the substitution of machines for labour.  Machines  made  possible  more  effective  production  and higher-quality  output.  They  also  allowed  for  the  replacement  of expensive craft labour with much cheaper semi-skilled labour at each of the multiple stages through which a good was manufactured-and most  especially  in what  had  been  the  highly  skilled  and  timeconsuming task of fitting together all of the component parts into the finished product. The new machinofacture thus centrally involved the replacement of 'fitting' (and fitters) with 'assembly' (and assemblers). 41

What enabled the new machine-tool sector to impart such a powerful stimulus to the development of US industry was its capacity to solve a series of roughly similar technical problems that had arisen in a wide range  of  consumer-goods  and  other  manufacturing  industries.  Techniques initially devised to solve production problems in such industries as textiles and gun-making were thus applied, over time, in clocks and watches, sewing-machines, agricultural implements, locomotives, locks, hardware, typewriters, bicycles and, ultimately, automobiles. Even by 1851 ,  foreign  observers  had  become  aware  of  the  rise  toward  world leadership of US industry and clearly saw that the key to its immanent superiority  was  the  use  of  machines  dedicated  to  extremely  specific tasks and constructed in highly specialized firms. By the 1860 s, manufacturers  had  already  begun  to  organize  their  factories  so  as  to  make possible the rational progression  of  semi-finished  products  from station to station throughout the shop and, in meatpacking and grain elevators,  to  devise  mechanisms  for  continuously  moving  these  commodities between work stations-the earliest assembly lines. 42

It  is  hard  to  overemphasize  the  centrality  of  the  autonomous  growth of  machine-based  mass  production  for  the  growth  of  mass  consumption,  or  the  centrality  of  the  growth  of  mass  consumption  for  US economic development, in the nineteenth century. In 1860 the top ten sectors of the US economy, listed in order of size, were as follows:

By Value Added :  ( 1 )  cotton  goods;  ( 2 )  lumber;  ( 3 )  boots  and  shoes;  ( 4 )  flour  and meal;  ( 5 )  men's  clothing;  ( 6 )  iron;  ( 7 )  machinery;  ( 8 )  woollen  goods;  ( 9 )  leather; ( 10 ) liquor.

By Number Employed : ( 1 ) boots and shoes; ( 2 ) cotton; ( 3 ) men's clothing; ( 4 ) lumber; ( 5 ) iron; ( 6 ) machinery; ( 7 ) woollens; ( 8 ) flour and meal; ( 9 ) leather; ( 10 ) liquor.

( Source :  D.C. North, Growth and Welfare in the American Past , 2 nd edition, Englewood Cliffs 1974 , p. 80 .)

It  may  thus  be  seen  that  the  greatest  part  of  US manufacturing-by value added and by employment-was devoted to production directly for  popular  consumption.  Since  so  much  of  iron  and  machinery  production was to meet the demand of the agricultural sector, as well as the mechanized consumer-goods industries, for tools, it seems reasonable to conclude-as  many  commentators  have  done-that  US development  even  by  the  time  of  the  Civil  War  was  being  heavily underwritten by the domestic market, by mass consumption . 43

It  is  easy  to  demonstrate  the  manner  and  degree  in  which  mass  consumption was predicated on mass production . Of the above ten leading industries,  at  least  eight-boots  and  shoes,  cottons  and  woollens, men's clothing, machinery, iron and steel, flour and meal, and distilling-had already experienced, or  were  fully  in  the  process  of  experiencing,  factory  mechanization  by  the  time  of  the  Civil  War  or immediately  after. 44 As  Carroll  D.  Wright  pointed  out  in  the  introduction to the census of manufactures for 1880 45 :

Of the nearly three millions of people employed in the mechanical industries of this country at least four fifths are working under the factory system. Some of the other remarkable instances of the applications of the system [besides those in textiles] are to be found in the manufacture of boots and shoes, of watches, musical instruments, clothing, agricultural instruments,  metal  goods  generally,  fire  arms,  carriages  and  wagons, wooden goods, rubber goods, and even the slaughtering of hogs. Most of these industries have been brought under the factory system in the past thirty years.

And  Chandler  adds:  'In  the  refinery  and  distilling  and  furnace  and foundry  industries  the  proportion  of  workers  employed  in  comparable  industrial  establishments  was  probably  even  higher.' 46 In  sum: the  capital-goods  sector  grew  up  in  large  part  to  serve,  and  to  make technically  possible,  mass  production  in  consumer-goods  industries. Once again, this seems flatly to contradict the contention of Aglietta and  the  Regulationists  that  the  paucity  of  links-technical  and exchange-between  Department  I and  Department  II was  a  defining characteristic of the  economy  that  directly  restricted  its  path  of accumulation.  On  the  contrary,  the  particular  genius  of  the US economy of the second half of the nineteenth century was the capacity of its capital-goods (mainly machine-tool) makers to invent and bring into play more effective means of production in direct response to the technical  needs  of  firms,  in  particular  consumer-goods  industries. Driven  by  competition,  capitalist  producers  dramatically  increased fixed capital investments, thereby making possible major increases in aggregate productivity-in other words, accumulation via the methods

of  extending  relative  surplus-value.  At  the  same  time,  lower  prices resulting  from  productivity  increases  combined  with  workers'  bargaining  power  to  allow  significant  increases  in  real  wages  and workers' consumption and an impressively growing home market.

This general picture is confirmed by indices of comparative performance,  which  show  that  between  the  Civil  War  and  World  War  I, us manufacturing  challenged  and  even  surpassed  the  British  industrial hegemon. Indeed, well before the end of this era, the US manufacturing economy secured a tremendous new source of dynamism through the application of science to technology. This 'second industrial revolution' was not just a question of the rise of the automobile, itself the culmination  of  the  growth  of  machinofacture  based  on  the  powerful machine-tool sector. It also brought entirely new or vastly transformed industries,  in  which  continuous-process  production  drew  upon  scientific  advances-namely,  chemicals,  petroleum,  petrochemicals,  steel, aluminium, cement, and so forth. 47

Comparative  economic  data  presented  by  Aglietta  himself  further undermine  the  idea  that  the  pattern  of  development  theoretically structured by competitive regulation and extensive accumulation held for the US in the latter part of the nineteenth century, or that the rise of mass consumption had to await the institutional transformations of the 'Fordist' epoch.

By  the  end  of  the  century,  then,  the  US economy  had  succeeded  in raising  its  labour  productivity  to  a  level  more  than  one-and-a-half times  that  of England  (and  some  two-and-a-half  times  that  of Germany),  and  on  that  basis  had  secured  unit  labour  costs  sharply lower  than  those  of  its  major  competitors  despite  paying  measurably higher  wages. 48 As we shall  see,  in  most  of  the  main  indices  of  economic  development-rate  of  growth  of  GDP per  capita,  proportion of  GNP devoted  to  fixed  (non-residential)  investment,  rate  of  growth

of investment in fixed capital per man-hour, and the like-the dynamism of the US economy between 1870 and 1914 was quite comparable to what it would be during the great boom of 1950 to 1973 49 .

We can therefore conclude that the Regulation School's notion of extensive  accumulation  governed  by  competitive  regulation  entirely  misconceptualizes a historical process of development, and that the period in question actually seems to have been distinguished by a rather spectacular degree of dependence on accumulation by way of the methods of relative surplus-value and the growth of mass consumption-to have amounted, in fact, to intensive accumulation. More to the point, because intensive accumulation  was  already  taking  place  on  institutional foundations that the Regulationists call the competitive mode of regulation, their overarching  interpretative  schema  of  institutionally founded  historical  phases  of  capital  accumulation  is  called  fundamentally into question. In this schema, a transition from extensive to intensive accumulation is supposed to constitute a pivotal moment: the rise  of  intensive  accumulation  is  prevented,  contradicted  and  undermined  by  the  competitive  mode  of  regulation;  the  establishment  of intensive  accumulation  is  predicated  upon  an  at  least  partial  transformation of competitive regulation; the contradiction between intensive accumulation and still partially competitive regulation lies behind the interwar crisis; and the emergence of a new mode of development-in which intensive accumulation is governed by a newly installed monopolistic or Fordist mode of regulation-is explained in large part as a resolution  of  that  contradiction.  If,  however,  the  initial  phase  of extensive  accumulation  never  existed  in  the  relevant  time  period, what  is  left  of  the  supposed  transition  to  intensive  accumulation?  If intensive accumulation grew up precisely on the basis of the institutions of  competitive  regulation,  what  remains  of  the  supposed  contradiction  between  competitive  regulation  and  intensive  accumulation,  of the fettering of the latter by the former? If there was no real contradiction  between  intensive  accumulation  and  still  partially  competitive regulation-since  competitive  relations  among  capitalists  and  on  the labour market could actually promote the dual growth of production and  consumption  and  of  output  and  demand  that  made  possible successful  intensive  accumulation-how  can  that  contradiction  lie behind the interwar crisis? If the interwar crisis was not the result of the  aforementioned  contradiction,  how  can  the  rise  of  institutions guaranteeing the Fordist consumption norm be said to have accounted for the transcendence of the interwar crisis in the postwar boom?

## III Mode of Development Two: Intensive Accumulation But Still Competitive Regulation

The  mode  of  development  defined  by  competitive  regulation  and extensive  accumulation  gave  way,  in  the  Regulationist  schema,  to  a new  mode  of  development  defined  by  a  still  essentially  competitive mode of regulation guiding a regime of intensive accumulation. The

changed  regime  of  accumulation  expressed  the  supersession  of  craft production  by  mass  production,  the  turn  to  massive  investment  in fixed  capital  embodying  major  advances  in  technique  with  returns expected over the long term, and a qualitative break to a new level of productivity  growth-most  generally,  a  process  of  capital  accumulation  founded  predominantly  on  the  extraction  of  relative  surplusvalue. The emergence of these new economic regularities, it is argued, was made possible by significant institutional changes. New forms of regulation  of  the  market  expressed  a  higher  degree  of  inter-capitalist organization,  and  within  the  manufacturing  enterprise  an  extended process of class struggle led to a break beyond craft control. Nevertheless, the mode of regulation remained in the last analysis competitive because the fundamental capital-labour wage relation was still essentially unregulated and marked by untrammelled competition, with the consequence that there was no transformation in the mode of workingclass  consumption  or  the  economy's  capacity  to  provide  demand  for the output of Department I.

## 1 . Mass Production without Mass Consumption

The  regime  of  intensive  accumulation  was,  most  immediately  and directly,  a  function  of  the  rise  of  Scientific  Management,  through which capitalist corporations succeeded, in the face of workers' resistance, in exerting  increasingly  systematic  control  over  the  labour process  so  as  to  achieve  technical  innovation.  Most  generally,  this involved  so-called  Taylorist  methods  of  rationalization:  an  acceleration of the mechanical processes of task completion (that is, an intensification of labour facilitated by time-and-motion studies); the filling up of gaps in the working day that resulted either from lack of coordination among machine functions or from work breaks; and, especially, the integration of mechanized segments of the labour process that had previously been separated (and often subject to significant control by the  workers  themselves).  Taylorism  culminated  in  and  was  transcended by the Fordist integration of the labour process, involving the introduction  of  conveyors  and  handling  devices  that  assured  the movement  of  materials  and  their  arrival  at  the  appropriate  machine tools. The coup de grâce was the automatic assembly line, which rigorously  fixed  workers  to  jobs  determined  by  the  configuration  of  the machine  system  and  deprived  them  of  all  control  over  their  work rhythm  and  job  autonomy.  The  labour  process  was  thus  'converted from  a  dense  network  of  relationships  between  jobs,  with  intermediate  products  passing  back  and  forth  [. . .]  into  a  straightforward linear flow of material under transformation.' 50

The establishment of the Taylorist-Fordist labour process was assisted by  a  transition  in  the  mode  of  regulation  of  capital-capital  relations away from full competition in the direction of oligopoly. A qualitative increase in the concentration of capital, the rise of finance-dominated trusts,  and  the  emergence  of  the  modern  corporation  allowed  for greater  inter-capitalist control  of competition,  markets  and  the

investment  environment  more  generally.  The  resulting  reduction  in the level of risk, combined with the destruction of craft control of the labour  process,  facilitated  a  qualitative  leap  in  fixed  capital  investment embodying technical advance, especially from the end of World War I. 51

Taken  together,  the  foregoing  processes  brought  about  the  rise  of a  new  mode  of  development  in  which  accumulation  by  the  methods of increasing  relative  surplus-value  came  to  predominate  and  the potential first emerged  for  regularized  mass  consumption.  Aglietta dates  the  beginnings  of  this  breakthrough  in  the  United  States  from the end of the nineteenth century and its decisive establishment from the 1920 s.

It  is  a  central  thesis  of  the  Regulation  School,  however,  that  because the new regime of intensive accumulation was still guided by a competitive mode of regulation in terms of the capital-labour wage relationship,  the  newly-emergent  mode  of  development  was  inherently unstable.  The  spectacular  growth  of  mass  production  thus  brought new  problems  because  it  continued  to  be  associated  with  restricted mass  consumption.  As  Aglietta  explains,  under  extensive  accumulation  capitalism  had  'implant[ed]  itself  for  a  long  historical  period without  destroying  traditional  ways  of  life,  indeed  even  benefiting from  the  reconstitution  of  labour-power  by  a  non-capitalist  environment in which it [was] still inserted.' Then came the rise of intensive accumulation.

The destruction of the traditional social environment is only accomplished by the development of heavy industry, which enforces the total uprooting that is characteristic of the wage relation: the separation of labour-power from all its conditions of existence. The mode of life of the wage-earning class then suffers a deep degradation. This degradation is the basis of the gigantic structural transformation that all the capitalist countries experienced from the end of the nineteenth century . . . 52

The  tendency  to  hold  down  workers'  wages  grew  more  acute,  then, around the turn of the century in the United States. This was due not only  to  the  producers'  loss  of  access  to  non-commodity  sources  of reproduction  and  their  (resultant)  flooding  onto  the  labour  market, but also to the massive downward pressure on wages from the rising wave of immigration. Then, in the wake of World War I, in a series of great  confrontations  with  capital,  workers  suffered  a  series  of  devastating defeats that opened the way for cuts in their living and working standards during the 1920 s. Finally, especially during the 1920 s, technical change further eroded their bargaining position by undermining the  old  craft-union  structures. 53 As  a  result:  '[T]he  disproportion between  expansion  in  Department  II and  accumulation  in  Department  I rapidly  increased,  since  the  forces  that  were  revolutionizing the  labour  process  were  also  those  reducing  effective  demand  for

commodities  from  Department  II.' 54 The  general  underlying  structural  contradiction  of  the  mode  of  development  based  on  intensive accumulation but governed by competitive regulation thus began suddenly to manifest itself during the late 1920 s, and issued in the great crisis of the 1930 s. Boyer sums up the problem as follows: '[M]ass production is technically possible, but cannot be sustained since the prevailing  'regulation'  strongly  moderates  real  wage  increases;  at  the same  time  as  wage-earners  become  a  dominant  fraction  of  the  total labour force. It turns out that such an intensive accumulation is highly contradictory (the profit rate is too high adequately to permit an adequate  effective  demand)  and  unstable.[. . .]  Therefore  this  is  not  a viable mode of development in the long run.' 55

What apparently allowed this mode of development to flower to the limited  extent  that  it  did  was  the  continuing  opportunities  for  the growth of Department I provided by the opening of the frontier. But as  the  possibilities  for  accumulation  on  the  frontier  were  exhausted, and  especially  as  the  pace  of  technical  change  suddenly  accelerated during the 1920 s, economic growth took place on increasingly fragile foundations.  For  a  brief  period,  growing  consumer  demand  from  the rising  middle  layer  of  managerial,  sales  and  technical  personnelpaid for out of the social surplus itself-endowed the economy with a new source of dynamism; but the underlying tendencies to the uneven development  of  Department  I and  underconsumption  could  not  forever be postponed.

## 2 . Was There a Structural Problem of Underconsumption?

At the core of the Theory of Regulation is the idea that the level and character  of  working-class  consumption  are:  (a)  in  crucial  respects institutionally  conditioned;  (b)  untransformable  through  changes  in technology and the labour process alone; and (c) critically determinative  for  the  path  of  capital  accumulation.  The  establishment  of  intensive  accumulation  on  a  stable  basis  therefore  required  institutions that  would  assure  the  Fordist  norm  of  working-class  consumption. Even so, it is possible that the Regulationists would deny that capitalism  in  general  is  subject  to  crises  of  underconsumption,  arguing merely that the crisis of the 1920 s needs to be understood in terms of historically developed tendencies associated with a quite specific path of  development-the  rise  of  intensive  accumulation  in  association with  a  still  competitive  mode  of  regulation.  The  fact  remains,  however,  that  an  underconsumptionist theory provides the basis for-and is indispensable to-not only their account of this crisis but also their institutional-historical theory of capitalist development in general.

This is evident, first of all, from the Theory of Capitalist Regulation , the founding text of the Regulation School, which is centred upon a very

explicit-if  not  fully  worked-out-traditional  underconsumptionist thesis.  More  generally,  underconsumptionism  is  the  dominant  theme within  a  Regulationist  approach  to  crisis  that  views  capitalism  as developing along a sort of tightrope, with the Scylla of a rising organic composition/falling rate of profit crisis on one side and the Charybdis of  a  rising  rate  of  profit/underconsumption  crisis  on  the  other.  From this  standpoint,  technical  mutations  originating  in  Department  I are at  the  core  of  capital  accumulation.  Thus,  'a  deepening  of  the  principle  of  mechanization  [. . .]  induces  a  rise  in  the  organic  composition  of  capital  as  the  counterpart  of  the  saving  on  labour-power. Relative  surplus-value  increases  thanks  to  an  ever  more  intensive renewal  of  the  means  of  production.  Department I consequently grows at an ever more rapid rate.' But this process involves a double danger.

On the one hand, if 'the transformation of the conditions of production takes place by a [. . .] rise in the organic composition of capital', unless  'wage  costs  fall  more  quickly  than  the  proportion  of  constant capital in total exchange-value rises [. . .] then the total costs of production increase [profitability falls] and the rate of accumulation slows down.' This is, of course, the classical falling-rate-of-profit motif.

On the other hand, while  it  is  true  that  'if  total  costs  of  production [do] fall, the result is an increase in the general rate of profit and an acceleration  of  the  rate  of  accumulation';  nonetheless,  'this  process can  be  impaired  by  diverging  forces'-notably,  forces  making  for insufficient  consuming power in society. Specifically:  '[i]  the  internal development  of  Department  I runs  too  far  ahead,  since  the  social demand  for  means  of  production  must  be  ever  greater  to  sustain  a sufficient saving of labour-power to permit the fall in the costs of production  to  continue;  [ii]  the  exchange-value  of  wages  distributed undergoes  a  relative  decline,  whilst  profits  build  up  more  and  more, particularly in Department I.' The result is a crisis of underconsumption leading to a crisis of realization.

A moment is necessarily reached when the rate of profit in Department I increases  relative  to  the  capital  advanced,  by  virtue  of  the  accelerated development of this department, whereas accumulation in Department II is restrained by the restriction of the social demand for means of consumption. The proportion of income assigned to purchase the exchange-value of Department  II grows  far  less  quickly  than  the  proportion  of  income assigned to purchase means of production [. . .] There is then an inevitable difference between the rate of profit in Department 1 and that in Department II. The result is that Department II becomes unable to purchase  sufficient  means  of  production  to  match  the  rate  of  growth  in Department I, since the distribution of income develops in a way that does not enable the formation of sufficient social demand for means of consumption. In these conditions, the constraint of full realization of exchangevalue is transgressed. [. . .] an overproduction of means of production. 56

In  Aglietta's  view,  the  underconsumptionist  dynamic  is  an  abiding problem of the capitalist mode of production, at the root not only of

the interwar crisis but also of the crisis of Fordism that began in the mid-to-late  sixties,  although  he  also  recognizes  that  the  underlying historical  conditions  were  very  different.  But  even  if  their  works  had failed to contain so clear a statement, the underconsumptionist thesis would  still  form  the  theoretical  foundation  of  the  Regulationists' entire edifice. This is because the direct logical outcome of their argument is that a capitalism developing on the basis of relative surplusvalue  will  experience  crises  of  underconsumption  in  the  absence  of historically  contingent  counteracting  tendencies-and,  more  specifically,  in  the  absence  of  special  institutional  forms  to  maintain  an  adequate  growth  of  workers'  consumption.  In  other  words,  capitalism without the Fordist  norm  of  working-class  consumption  suffers  from underconsumption.  As  Boyer  succinctly  puts  it,  'when  wage  formation is mainly competitive, a new industrial revolution leads to such a high profit rate that it cannot be sustained in the long run because of a lack of appropriate total demand.' 57

The two main factors which the Regulation School sees at work here -( ) inadequate growth of Department II, leading to a disproportion1 ality  between  Department  I and  Department  II,  and  ( 2 ) pressures against  the  growth  of  wages,  leading  to  inadequate  incomes  to  purchase  the  growing  output  from  ever  rising  capital  investment-are precisely  the  ones  which  advocates  of  the  underconsumptionist  position,  from  Malthus  to  Sweezy,  have  seen  as  the  source  of  capitalist crisis. 58 Yet no mechanism has yet been provided to show why these factors-both  tending  to  issue  in  inadequate  consumer  demandshould  generate  serious  problems.  If  profit  rates  rise  in  the  capitalgoods sector owing to increased investment opportunities, why should further investment not flow into capital goods until profit rates equalize? In parallel manner, why is it that supposedly insufficient demand for  consumer  goods-and  therefore  for  capital  goods  in  Department II-will not be more than offset by demand for capital goods by firms seeking  to  remain  competitive  through  investment  and  technical change (which itself will lead to increased consumer demand by bringing about increased employment)? 59

It  is  somewhat  curious,  in  this  respect,  that  the  Regulationists  make no  reference  to  the  one  serious  attempt  in  the  past  half-century  to

demonstrate  the  logical  necessity  of  crises  of  underconsumptionan  effort  that  actually  has  the  same  point  of  departure  as  theirs. Paul  Sweezy,  like  Aglietta  et  al.,  thus  begins  from  the  premiss  that Department 1 grows  faster  than  Department  II in  consequence  of the  competitive  pressure  to  accumulate  and  innovate.  (Another  way of stating  this  would  be  that  investment  grows  faster  than  consumption  as  a  portion  of  national  income.)  His  second  premiss, viewed as technologically determined, is that the result of increases in investment  will  be  increases  in  output  proportional  to  the  increase in  means  of  production;  that  is,  that  with  increased  investment,  the incremental  capital/output  ratio  will  remain  constant.  He  concludes that because  necessarily  proportionally  increased  investment  will lead  to  proportionally  ever  greater  output,  while  consumption  takes an ever decreasing proportion of national income, output will outrun consumption. 60

But  there  are  two  errors  in  Sweezy's  argument.  The  first,  already mentioned,  is  the  unwarranted  assumption  that  rising  investment necessarily entails a roughly  proportionate  increase  in  consumergoods  output.  The  second  is  the  assumption  that  increased  investment,  taking  up  a  greater  share  of  national  output,  will  not  only produce  a  larger  quantity  of  goods  (use-values),  but  also  produce goods  of  greater  value,  which  cannot  by  hypothesis  be  bought.  In fact, increased  investment,  while  bringing  about  an  increase  in physical units of output, will, in consequence of the technical change embodied,  produce  units  of  less  value  than  before-that  is,  an aggregate output in value terms that may still be able to be consumed. The upshot is that there is no problem in specifying a path of stable capital  accumulation,  in  accord  with  Sweezy's  two  premisses,  that avoids underconsumption. 61

To sum up: none of the many different theorists of the inevitability of realization/underconsumption  crises  has  yet  put  forward  a  systematic and general argument to show that realization will not take place by way  of  the  increased  aggregate  demand  that  stems  from:  (i)  further expansion of capital investment (demand for capital goods), under the pressure  of  competition  requiring  technical  change  and  through  use of the new labour forces that are almost always available; (ii) new consumer spending by the labour forces employed to make the additional capital  goods;  (iii)  the  rising  wages  that  can  usually  be  expected  to accompany technical change over any temporally extended process of capital accumulation;  (iv)  unproductive  expenditures.  The  point obviously  is  not  that  serious  problems  of  effective  demand  cannot arise;  it  is  merely  that  accumulation  through  the  relative  growth  of Department 1 vis-à-vis Department II leading to an increase in relative surplus  value,  in  the  absence  of  institutions  assuring  a  workers'  consumption norm, does not, in itself, constitute an adequate mechanism for determining the appearance of such problems.

It needs to be emphasized that, in the course of capital accumulation, the  growth  of  demand  and  consumption  will  in  fact  generally  take place  much  more  quickly  and  efficaciously  through  a  rise  in  investment leading to the hiring of more workers than through an increase in  wages  per  worker.  For  example,  in  the  postwar us , changes  in employment account for some 80 per cent of the changes in aggregate demand. 62 Especially for this reason, theories that seek to understand crisis as the result of a lack of effective demand would seem obliged to provide  some  other  mechanism-not  just  insufficient  working-class consumption-that leads to insufficient investment.

## 3 . Did the Development of an Intensive Regime of Accumulation under the Competitive Mode of Regulation Bring About a Structural Crisis of Underconsumption in the 1920 s?

In the  Regulationists'  model,  the  problem  of  mass  consumption emerged in potential as soon as the regime of intensive accumulation had  been  established.  Indeed,  following  the  argument  initially advanced  by  Alvin  Hansen  and  other  Keynesian  interpreters  of  the Great  Depression,  the  Regulationists  believe  that  the  crisis  of  the 1930 s  was  delayed  as  long  as  it  was  only  because  certain  historically contingent  factors-above  all,  the  continuing  possibilities  of 'the frontier'-tended  to  counteract  the  uneven  development  of Department 1 and  underconsumption. 63 What  is  the  evidence  for this? Did the rise of intensive accumulation within the context of the competitive  mode  of  regulation  create  the  structural  problems  of uneven  development  of  Department 1 and  underconsumption  that resulted in the interwar crisis? Was that the reason why special institutions  had  to  be  created  to  ensure  workers'  consumption,  thereby avoiding  or  transcending  crisis  and  achieving  successful  development in the long run?

First, we need to insist again that there is no evidence-quite the contrary-to  support  the  Regulationists'  basic  thesis  that  intensive accumulation  was  fundamentally  incompatible  with  competitive regulation,  requiring  an  institutionally  insured  workers  consumption norm  to  achieve  stability.  Despite  a  secular  trend  to  significantly rising  productivity,  wages  were  able  to  maintain,  and  perhaps  even increase, their share in national income over the period 1850-1914 , as follows:

But what of the crisis of the 1920 s? The Regulationists argue that capitalists were then installing the new technologies of Fordist mass production  at  an  unprecedentedly  rapid  rate.  This  increased  the  proportion of investment funds going to Department I vis-à-vis Department II and  radically  increased  productivity  growth.  But  because  wages were held down in favour of profits, a crisis resulted from disproportionality between the two departments and lack of sufficient workingclass  consumption.  We  should  therefore  expect  to  find,  during,  the twenties, a trend for the profit rate and the profit share to rise at the expense  of  wage  growth  and  the  wage  share  and  for  consumption  to lose out to investment. What is the evidence?

First of all, far from being held down, real wages in the manufacturing sector  rose  dramatically  in  the  period  from  the  end  of  World  War  I. By 1924 they were about 33 per cent higher than they had been in 1914 and about 44 per cent higher than in 1917 . After that, they remained roughly at the level of 1924 until the end of the decade.

Similarly,  partly  as  a  result  of  this  rise  in  real  wages,  the  share  of profits  (vis-à-vis  wages)  in  national  income  fell  precipitately  during the 1920 s. Whereas in the period 1900-1919 the profit share had fluctuated  between 41 per  cent  and 48 per  cent  of  the  national  income, during the period from 1922 to 1929 it fluctuated at levels between 28 per cent and 32 per cent of national income. 64

At the same time, as Dumenil, Glick and Levy have shown, far from rising disproportionately between 1917 and 1929 , the rate of return on investment (that is, the profit rate) remained on average significantly below  the  prewar  and  wartime  years  of 1900-1917 and,  though  it recovered somewhat from the immediate postwar collapse, at no time did  it  reach  even  the  average  rate  recorded  between 1900 and 1917 . If  the  depression  had  found  its  cause  in  a  squeeze  by  profits  upon wages, it should have come before, not after, World War I. 65

Given that the wage share rose, it is perhaps not surprising that, over the period 1919-29 , there was no decline in the rate of growth of total consumption. Indeed, the proportion of consumption in total income reached levels significantly higher than it had attained in any previous decade (relevant data are available from 1890 ) or would reach again in any decade up to the present. 66 (See Figure VI, below, p. 95 .)

In  order  to  buttress  the  hypothesis  that  demand  was  insufficient in  the 1920 s,  Aglietta  argues  that  the  growth  in  consumer-durables industries  fell after 1926 , and  that  residential  housing  construction  also  declined  in  the  same  year . 67 Let  us  consider  each  of  these points.

Aglietta  maintains  that  the  rate  of  profit  in  the  consumer-durables sector  was  lower  than  average  throughout  the 1920 s  and  that  this manifested  chronically  low  consumer  demand.  Nevertheless,  he  gives no  evidence  that  there  were  serious  problems  in  this  sector  before 1926 . According to the standard work on profitability in the consumer and  producer-goods  industries  in  this  period,  the  consumer-goods industries actually enjoyed a much higher rate of return than did the producer-goods  industries:  '[t]he 18 industries  manufacturing  producers'  goods  show  an  aggregate  earnings  rate  that  runs  from 6 per cent in 1922 to 10 per cent in both 1923 and 1925 and stands at 8 per cent  in 1928 .  The  group  making  consumers'  goods ( 26 industries) enjoys  much higher and much steadier earnings-from 12 to 16 per cent in all years of the same period.' 68

The high rate of profit in consumer goods in the 1920 s was a result of the  fact  that  'sales  in  consumers'  goods  groups  grew  somewhat  more rapidly  than  did  capital  investment'.  Although  Aglietta  is  right  to claim that the growth in sales of consumer durables slowed after 1926 , investment  continued  to  move  into  this  sector-that  is,  its  rate  of investment  relative  to  the  rate  of  investment  in  producer  goods  did not  fall-because  its  rate  of  profit  remained  absolutely  higher  than

that  of  every  other  sector  up  to  the  crash  of 1929 .  Slowing  sales  but high rates of return are far more suggestive of an adjustment process than of a descent into crisis. 69

Aglietta  further  maintains  that  the  downturn  in  the  growth  of  residential  housing  construction  was  a  sign  of  underconsumption.  But although it is true that the value of residential construction declined from $ 5 7 . billion in 1925 to $ 3 2 . billion in 1929 , this sector represented only 4 per cent of GNP, so a decline in its growth can hardly, in itself, constitute  evidence  of  economy-wide  problems  in  consumption. Moreover,  as  has  often  been  argued,  residential  construction  appears to follow its own long-term trend and the drop from 1926 seems best understood as a turning point in this cycle. In any case, any reduction in  consumption that occurred as a result of the decline of residential construction was at least compensated by the growth in other sectors, for,  as  we  have  already  noted,  there  was  no  longer  term  problem  of consumption during the 1920 s. 70

Finally, increasingly  insufficient  demand  should-by  hypothesishave been reflected in declining use of existing plant and equipment. The  fact  is,  however,  that  there  is  no  good  evidence  of  a  significant decline in capacity utilization in the 1920 s, right up to the moment of the crash. 71

This is not the place to offer an alternative account of the crisis of the interwar period. Nevertheless, one can at least suggest that the point of departure should be less changes occurring during the decade of the 1920 s itself than the contrast between the economy of the 1920 s and the  interwar  period  as  a  whole  and  that  of  the  epoch  before  World War I. Thus, it may be thought that the major fall in the rate of return on  investment  introduced  into  the  economy  of  the 1920 s a  new fragility that made it fatally vulnerable to the various shocks that triggered  the  crisis-the  farm  crisis,  international  imbalances,  monetary problems,  and  so  forth.  From  this  standpoint,  the  central  focus  for investigation  into  what  caused  the  Great  Depression  should  be  the problem of what caused the drop in profitability in the period following World War I.

## IV Mode of Development Three: Intensive Accumulation and Monopoly Regulation

In  the  view  of  the  Regulation  School,  the  crisis  of  the 1930 s  was resolved  through  the  establishment  of  a  new  mode  of monopoly  regulation . This  served  to  supersede  the  basic  contradiction  between intensive  accumulation  and  competitive  regulation  by  constituting  a complex  set  of  institutions  that  not  only  regularized  inter-capitalist

competition  but  also,  for  the  first  time,  made  for  significant  regulation  of  the  capital-labour  wage  relation  and  thereby  allowed  the growth  of  workers'  consumption  to  meet  the  requirements  of intensive  capital  accumulation.  According  to  the  Regulationists,  the monopoly mode of regulation was not installed easily or directly, but only  as  a  result  of  the  massive  crisis  and,  especially,  the  great  class conflicts  of  the 1930 s.  The  success  of  workers'  struggles  in  founding the  CIO and  winning  the  Wagner  Act  was  thus  indispensable  in setting off the chain of events 'whose outcome was the establishment of social controls to guarantee the formation of the working-class norm of  consumption  and  to  regularize  its  evolution'. 72 More  generally,  in Boyer's words:

In monopolist  regulation ( régulation  monopoliste ), the  distribution  of  income  is significantly  socialized  through  a  series  of  compromises  between  capital and labour (Fordist wage formation along with inflation and productivity), between firms (mark-up pricing), and between the state, citizens and capital (welfare state, pattern of public spending and tax system). Therefore the pure price adjustment mechanism bears only a minor part of the burden in adjusting social  demand and production. To a large extent, a complex set of institutions, conventions and rules constantly aims at developing effective  demand  at  the  same  rate  as  production  capacity,  which  in  turn  is partially  linked  to  the  intensity  and  direction  of  technical  change  via  the accumulation process. 73

## 1 . The Dynamics of Fordism and the Post-World War II Boom

Even under the unstable mode of development of the interwar period, structured by intensive accumulation and still-competitive regulation, corporations  had,  in  the  Regulationists'  view,  gone  some  distance toward  stable  growth  by  regulating  inter-capitalist  competition  and achieving a degree of control over markets. As it matured after World War  II,  ' Oligopolistic  competition [ . . . ] moderate[d]  possible  struggles between firms by eliminating price cuts as the usual tool for obtaining market  shares.'  Instead,  'firms  compete[d]  through  advertising,  and more  generally  through  product  differentiation,  while  prices  [we]re derived from a mark-up applied to average costs.' 74

But the fundamental distinguishing feature of the new Fordist mode of regulation was to be found, again, on the side of demand: the 'capitalist class [now] seeks overall management of the production of wagelabour  by  the  close  articulation  of  relations  of  production  with  the commodity relations in which the wage-earners purchase their means of  production  [. . .]  between  process  of  production  and  mode  of  consumption.' 75 Most  pivotal  in  this  respect  was  a  particular  form  of collective bargaining in which labour ceded to management full sovereignty over the labour process in exchange for wage increases in line

with  productivity  growth  and  inflation. 76 This  allowed  capital  to accelerate innovation  without  fear  of  workers'  opposition  and  to make major placements of fixed capital without fear that these would fail to be realized as a consequence of sudden drops in wages and thus demand.  'Now  that  they  could  incorporate  into  capital  advanced  a future wage movement known with a high degree of probability, the corporations  systematically introduced  and  extended  the  semiautomatic  labour  process  applied  to  long  and  standardized  production runs.' 77

Collective  bargaining  was  buttressed  by  the  state's  adoption  of Keynesian fiscal  and  monetary  policies,  which  made  up  for  shortfalls of demand and so smoothed out the business cycle and prevented high levels of unemployment. Meanwhile, the welfare state, broadly speaking, constituted a safety-net for the structurally or temporarily unemployed and, in so doing, both redistributed income toward the working class  and  functioned  in  counter-cyclical  fashion  to  keep  the  economy turning  over.  Finally,  new  institutions  were  fashioned  to  facilitate long-term consumer credit. The ultimate outcome was to allow for the regular matching of production with consumption, thus transcending the  tendency  toward  underconsumption  and  providing  the  basis  for the great postwar boom. 78

## 2 . Does Stable Intensive Accumulation Require Monopoly Regulation?

The Regulationists seem largely to take it for granted that, for most of the  twentieth  century,  monopolies  or  oligopolies  dominated  markets in  the  United  States  and  other  advanced  capitalist  economies.  Monopolistic control, by eliminating the likelihood of radical devalorization of capital consequent upon the invasion of markets by lower-cost producers,  made  possible  the  ongoing  investment  in  fixed  capital  that was  crucial  to  intensive  accumulation.  Which  economic-institutional arrangements, however, allowed for monopoly in the first place? This issue  immediately poses itself because the existence of monopoly signifies that some firms are securing over time higher-than-average rates of profit , in  the  face  of  the  general  drive  of  capitalist  firms  to  invest wherever  there  are  higher-than-average  profit  rates  and,  in  so  doing, to bring them down to the average.

In the standard view, partially rehearsed by Aglietta, the evolution of capitalism, by bringing about the growth of market concentration and a  massive  centralization  of  capital,  eventuates  more  or  less  directly in the  transition of capital-capital  relations from  competitive  to

monopolistic regulation. Giant corporations are thus able to establish monopolistic positions by virtue of the decreasingly small numbers of firms  in  each  industry  and  especially  the  growth  of  discouragingly large  fixed-capital  requirements  to  enter  each  field.  It  is  sometimes additionally argued that small numbers of producers in a given industry pave the way for collusive price-fixing and control over output. As Marx put it: 'Competition rages in direct proportion to the numbers, and inverse proportion to the magnitudes of, antagonistic capitals.' 79

But the problem with this view is that capitalist development has not only  tended  to  increase  concentration  and  the  size  of  capital  investment  required  for  entry.  It  has  also  tended  to  create  the institutional forms through  which  capitalists  can  mobilize  enough  abstract  capital for  entry  into  any  field  where  producers  are  achieving  a  higher-thanaverage rate of profit. First, the modern corporation itself, by increasing  the  financial,  or  free,  capital  at  the  disposal  of  management  for reallocation  to  the  point  of  highest  return,  and  by  increasing  the rapidity and geographical reach of such capital transfers, has forged a powerful instrument for the undermining of monopoly. This is above all true of the highly evolved corporate forms to be found in East Asia ( keiretsu and chaebol of  Japan  and  Korea,  respectively),  which  instantiate a hitherto unprecedented degree of merger between financial and manufacturing  capital  and  allow  a  hitherto  unattainable  degree  of diversification.  Secondly,  the  giant  banks,  mobilizing  much  of  the world's  capital,  are  in  a  position  to  offer  sufficient  finance  for  entry into  any  line  where  the  rate  of  profit  is  significantly  higher  than average.  Thirdly,  capitalist  states  themselves,  especially  in  the  developing  countries,  have  made  possible  hitherto  unrealizable  allocations of capital to national industries, even in lines where the potential rate of  profit  was  not  necessarily-or  even  potentially-higher  than  average.  Given,  moreover,  modern  developments  in  transportation  and communication,  firms  are  in  a  position  to  materialize  their  financial resources  in  the  form  of  real  productive  capacity  with  the  greatest speed in history. That competition can now emerge from such a multitude of points throughout the international system obviously makes stable monopoly massively more difficult to establish.

In  response  to  competition,  firms  can  of  course  achieve  temporary monopolies  (above-average  rates  of  return)  through  the  barrier  of cost-cutting  inventions;  this  is  what  drives  capital  accumulation  and the  development  of  the  productive  forces.  But  the  barrier  will  eventually  be  dissolved  by  imitative  competitors,  who  can  be  counted  on to  secure  whatever  means  are  required  to  enter  the  field  and  restore the rate of profit to average in that particular line.

It  needs  to  be  emphasized  that  the  tendency  to  bring  about  average rates  of  return  in  the  different  lines  of  capitalist  production  cannot work  itself  out  immediately;  there  is  no  smooth  and  instantaneous

process  of  adjustment.  As  a  result,  firms  may,  for  reasons  other  than sole  possession  of  an  advanced  productive  technique,  secure  monopoly  profits  temporarily,  especially  in  local  markets.  But  the  point  is that  those  industries  in  which  prices  compared  to  costs  yield  higher than average profit rates will attract, over  time , additional investment; supply will then go up until prices have fallen sufficiently to restore the rate of return to the average of the economy as a whole. To achieve long-run  monopoly  profit  rates,  industries  must  secure political barriers to entry via support from the state; but regulated industries are, of  course,  (at  least  in  the  United  States)  relatively  few  and  becoming even  fewer.  Contrary  to  the  theory  of  the  monopoly  stage  of  capital, which the Regulationists have more or less uncritically appropriated, the  ability  of  corporations  to  erect  protective  barriers  to  competition actually  decreases  with  the  evolution  of  capitalism,  for  as  the  social and physical barriers of the past are overcome, the conditions for the existence  of  capital  in  the  abstract  are  ever  more  fully  established. 80 Since  monopoly  would  seem,  in  historical  terms,  to  be  increasingly difficult,  while  capital  accumulation would seem, over time, to have, if anything,  become  more  effective  in  almost  every  respect,  it  is difficult to see the securing of monopoly as a central precondition for the  dynamic  investment  path  associated  with  intensive  accumulation in general and the postwar economy in particular.

Above  all,  the  Regulationist  thesis  that  the  dynamism  of  the  postWorld War II economy was predicated upon monopoly regulation is prima facie dubious for the simple reason that a very extended, historically  spectacular  process  of  long-term intensive capital  accumulation on the basis of relative surplus-value was obviously quite possible and actually took place on the basis of the competitive mode of regulation. As we have seen, moreover, the crisis of the 1920 s did not result from some  'unviability'  of  intensive  accumulation  based  on  competitive regulation;  nor  was  the  constitution  of  a  Fordist  norm  of  workingclass  consumption  required  to  establish  intensive  accumulation  on  a viable basis. There thus seems little warrant for interpreting the transcendence of the crisis or the ensuing prosperity in terms of the growth of mass consumption.

## 3. The Role of Monopoly Regulation in the Postwar Boom

What, then, was the place of the institutions of monopoly regulation in  underpinning  the  postwar  boom  and  determining  the  pattern  of capital accumulation throughout the period?

## Monopoly

It is not possible within this compass to offer a detailed empirical discussion  of  the  nature  of  inter-capitalist  competition  in  the  postwar United States. It should be mentioned in passing that the idea of an empirical  link  between  concentration  and  profit  rates  in  an  industry was popularized by three influential studies carried out in the 1950 s and 1960 s by Bain, Stigler and Mann. 81 Yet, as was argued at the time, all three of these studies were biased by the fact that they were confined to the short term. 82 Since the mechanism tending to undercut a higherthan-average rate of profit in an industry is the redirection of investment, and since the redirection of investment requires time, any study that wishes to establish the existence of barriers to entry must take in the long run. Recent studies, using newly available data on industrial profitability over the period 1948 to 1979 , have concluded that when the  focus  is  actually  on  the  long  run,  apparent  industrial  profit-rate differentials do indeed tend to lessen significantly. 83

## The Institutions of Mass Consumption

When we turn to the role of mass consumption in the postwar boom, two observations appear especially relevant. First, the crisis was transcended well before the essential structures of monopoly regulation had been  put  into  place.  Second,  the  Regulationists  have  yet  to  show  in just  what  way  a  new  pattern  of  mass  consumption  per  se-let  alone the  Fordist  institutions  ostensibly  accounting  for  it-actually  determined  the  characteristic  trajectory  of  the  US economy  after  World War II.

The Regulationists see the New Deal as the turning point in the establishment  of  Fordist  institutions.  This  may,  in  retrospect,  have  been the case. Yet it is crucial to note that, whatever their long-term significance, the developments of the 1930 s had failed to establish the foundations for mass consumption by the end of the decade. At no point during  the  thirties  did  the  government  adopt  Keynesian  methods  of stoking  demand  through  deficit  spending.  Government  expenditures did grow, but the budget was generally kept in balance by means of tax  increases. 84 Equally  important,  although  the  UAW's  historic  victory over General Motors in the winter of 1936-37 may perhaps have marked the breakthrough for the establishment of industrial unions in

the  US,  the  success  of  their  drive  for  recognition  was  by  no  means assured  at  that  point.  The  CIO absorbed  a  decisive  defeat  at  Little Steel  in 1937 and  could  organize  no  further  in  either  auto  or  steel during the remainder of the decade. Until it could resume its forward march,  the  union  movement  was  unable  significantly  to  affect  the course  of  wage  growth,  and  further  victories  were  not  achieved  until European  militarization  set  off  the  new  boom.  The  upshot  was  that neither  the  Roosevelt  administration's  policies  nor  the  CIO's  organizing could prevent the economy from collapsing once again in 1937-38 ; the  unemployment  rate  soon  soared  to 20 per  cent  and  depression continued until the run-up to war. The New Deal, in itself, had little or nothing to do with the end of the depression.

In so far as a rise in demand helped pull the economy from depression -and that was  far  from  the  full  story-the  impetus  came  not  from the institutionalization of a higher level of working-class consumption but from massive deficit-spending on armaments. Following the war, of  course,  this  continued  at  a  spectacular  level,  amounting  to 80 per cent of federal government purchases of goods and services and 9 per cent of GNP through 1960 85 .

Still,  the  questions  that  must  be  raised  are:  ( 1 )  What  made artificial injections  of  demand  such  powerful  stimuli?  ( 2 )  Why  did  the  boom continue  for  a  quarter  of  a  century?  Here  two  facts  immediately impose themselves. First, the initial exit from crisis at the end of the 1930 s was marked by a vertiginous rise in the rate of profit. Equally to the  point,  during  the  quarter-century  of  boom  from  the  start  of  the war until the middle 1960 s, the rate of profit, adjusted for capacity utilization , averaged  more  than  twice  the  rate  at  which  it  had  maintained itself, on average, during the two interwar decades of crisis. 86 That is, the profit rate was very low during the 1920 s and 1930 s and very high during the 1940 s, 1950 s  and first  half  of  the 1960 s.  Growth in consumption, in demand, is incapable in itself of explaining such dramatic movements in this fundamental economic variable.

If Fordist institutions cannot directly account for the transcendence of the Depression, what evidence is there of a connection between institutionally  assured  mass  consumption  and  the  specific  mode  of  development of the postwar economy, particularly the great boom? It must be  doubted,  in  the  first  place,  whether  the  so-called  capital-labour accord-in which the unions ceded control over the labour process in exchange for productivity deals and cost-of-living clauses-could have played the decisive role assigned to it by the Regulationists in ensuring that  consumption  kept  up  with  investment  and  wages  kept  up  with profits. Following the United Auto Workers' historic settlement with GM in 1950 ,  contractual  provisions  to  vary  wages  with  productivity

and with the cost of living did become more common. But this is in no way to say that capital ever resigned itself to the principle of maintaining  labour's  share  or  failed  to  fight  tooth  and  nail  to  limit  the degree to which wages kept up with the cost of living or with productivity.  There  was  never  anything  resembling  a  generalized  'social  contract'  (à  la  Social  Democratic  Sweden)  on  how  revenue  was  to  be divided between investment and consumption or between profits and wages. To the degree that consumption and wages did keep up with investment and profits in consequence of developments in the private sector, it was only as an unplanned outcome of myriad uncoordinated private  decisions  by  firms  about  prices  and  myriad  employer-labour conflicts over the terms of employment.

Moreover,  as  Aglietta  himself  explains,  the  misnamed  capital-labour 'accord'  represented  the  outcome  of  management's  victory  and  the unions' defeat in an extended and very bitter process of class struggle that had begun on the morrow of World War II. By the late 1950 s, the employers had largely succeeded in reappropriating the rather significant  degree  of  shopfloor  control  that  the  unions  had  temporarily secured in the great struggles of the 1930 s and early 1940 s. In Aglietta's words, 'the entire drift of the class struggle in the United States since the  war  has  been  to  transform  collective  bargaining  into  a  battering ram of  the  employers.' 87 In  light  of  this  shift  in  the  balance  of  class forces in favour of capital , it would have been surprising indeed to find employers voluntarily allowing contractual provisions that guaranteed the workers' share as the boom reached its apex.

But  did  real  wages  actually  keep  up  with  productivity?  In  fact,  the ratio  of  the  wage  index  to  the  labour  productivity  index  for  the private  nonfarm  economy falls fairly  steadily  for  the  entire  period from 1948 to 1970 . In  other  words,  wage  growth  lagged  behind productivity growth through almost the whole of the postwar boom. As  Aglietta  himself  notes:  'The  watershed  years  of 1958-61 saw  an acceleration  in  the  fall  in  social  wage  costs  [that  is,  in  unit  labour costs] proceeding from a sudden change in the forms of class struggle to  the  detriment  of  the  wage-earners';  and  the  period  from 1958 to 1966 ,  the  height  of  the  boom,  witnessed  the  'spectacular  growth  of relative surplus-value',  as rising labour  productivity  outran  the growth of real wages, with the result that profitability in the corporate sector grew by some 33 per cent or more over the period 1958-66 88 . The epoch of 'Fordist  collective  bargaining',  if  it  existed,  thus  lasted for a few years in the 1950 s.

What about aggregate consumption? Were the other Fordist institutions,  including  Keynesian  counter-cyclical  policies  and  the  welfare state,  more  effective  than  the  capital-labour  'accord'  in  maintaining the level of consumption as against investment? In reality, the share of

consumption  in  GNP throughout  the  postwar  boom  was  not  only 20 per cent lower than it had been during the ostensibly underconsumptionist  twenties,  but  perceptibly  lower  than  at  any  other  time  since 1890 (outside of brief periods during the two World Wars).

It should  be  emphasized  in  passing  that  the  Japanese  economy, undoubtedly the most dynamic since World War II, exhibited none of the  consumption/investment  or  wages/productivity  patterns  that  the Regulationists  view  as  central  to  stable  intensive  accumulation.  As Itoh  has  shown,  the  average  annual  rate  of  growth  of  labour productivity  in  Japan  was  between 50 per  cent  and 100 per  cent higher  than  the  rate  of  growth  of  real  wages  throughout  the  period from 1955 to 1970 (and the disparity became far greater over the fifteen years that followed). What allowed effective aggregate demand to soar was not so much rising consumption as investment in new plant and equipment, which grew at an annual pace of 22 per cent over the years 1956-73 ,  more  than  twice  as  fast  as  GDP.  Clearly,  there  was nothing  inherently  contradictory  in  a  long-term  growth  trajectory driven by what Aglietta calls 'the uneven development of Department I'. 89

Finally,  it  turns  out  that  serious  problems  are  posed  for  Regulation

Theory  even  in  specifying  what  was  distinctive  about  the  US growth pattern  during  the  'Fordist'  epoch  following  World  War  II.  For  the powerful  wave  of  growth  was  not  of  a  different  order  of  magnitude from that achieved in the era between the Civil War and World War I-the epoch characterized by the Regulationists in terms of extensive accumulation  and  competitive  regulation.  This  can  be  seen  by  comparing a series of fundamental variables:

In only one significant variable-the average annual rate of growth of productivity-are  the  results  in  the  later  period  appreciably  better. But, even here, they are no greater on average than in the 'pre-Fordist'

period  from 1913 to 1950 ( 2 6 . per  cent  per  annum  in  both  cases). Besides, the discrepancy with the epoch before World War I does not confirm the Regulationists' argument; for what, in their view, endows Fordist economy with its superior capacity for rapid technical change is its facilitation of fixed capital investment by overcoming the institutional  barriers  supposedly  built  into  the  competitive  mode  of  regulation-specifically, craft control, inter-capitalist competition,  and restricted  consumer  demand.  And  it  was  precisely  in  the  rate  of growth  of  fixed  capital  that  the  pre-World  War  I  economy  was  the equal of the period after World War II. 90

## V Towards a New (Fourth) Mode of Development?

## 1 . The Crisis of Fordism

According to the Regulationists, the Fordist settlement of the postwar era brought stability and growth by virtue of its success in solving the problem  of  realization  and  underconsumption,  which  had  been rooted  in  the  tendency  for  Department 1 to  grow  disproportionately vis-à-vis  Department  II and  the  inability  of  the  interwar  economy  to redistribute  income  toward  labour  and  away  from  capital.  At  the same time, precisely by allowing the intensive regime of accumulation to  reach  fruition,  the  new  mode  of  monopoly  regulation  made  possible  the  inexorable  maturation of certain fundamental contradictions that  were  built  into  the  Fordist  mode  of  development.  Nevertheless, the  Regulation  School  is  not  entirely  clear,  or  at  one,  as  to  precisely what these contradictions were.

Aglietta  argues  that  the  origins  of  the  crisis  beginning  in  the  mid 1960 s, as of the interwar crisis, are to be found in the uneven development of Department 1 .

The watershed years of 1958-61 saw an acceleration in the fall in social wage costs [. . .] This inaugurated the most intense wave of accumulation in  the  whole  history  of  American  capitalism,  which  rapidly  broke  the dynamic equilibrium of expansion of the two departments. Department 1 expanded more rapidly than Department II and became more differentiated, the sub-department producing actual means of production experiencing particularly fast growth sustained by the general transformation of production processes. [. . .] The result was deeply unbalanced accumulation which was only maintained in so far as the relative surplus-value produced could be accumulated at an accelerated pace. This tempo could itself be maintained only if manufacturing processes were altered more and more  quickly  to  supply  the  growing  demand  addressed  to  the  subdepartment producing means of production. 1966 saw the impending blockage of this mode of accumulation.

There  can  be  no  doubt  as  to  the  permanence  and  centrality  that Aglietta  thus  attaches  to  the  problems  of  uneven  development  of Department 1 and  insufficient  working-class  consumption.  As  he explains: whereas in the crisis of the 1920 s, 'the real issue was the allaround  establishment  of  the  regime  of  intensive  accumulation',  the crisis  beginning  in  the  mid 1960 s,  'pose[s]  a  deeper  question:  are there limits to the transformation of the conditions of existence of the wage-earning  class  in  the  form  of  an  extension  of  commodity  relations?'  It  is in  relationship  to  this  underlying  contradiction  that Aglietta  proffers  a  series  of  possible  solutions  to  the  crisis  through further  'post-Fordist'  restructuring  of  working-class  consumptionmost notably, the rise of a health complex. 91

There  is,  however,  a  second  account  of  the  crisis  to  be  found  in Aglietta's  work,  ostensibly  linked  to  the  first,  which  has  received much  greater  emphasis  in  the  studies  of  the  leading  continuators of  the  Paris  version  of  Regulation  Theory,  most  prominently  Boyer and  Lipietz.  From  this  standpoint,  the  crisis  originates  when  capital accumulation slips off on 'the other side' of its tightrope: it now falls prey  not  to  the  unevenness  between  Departments  I and  II but to  the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as a result of labour-productivity growth insufficient to raise the rate of surplus-value to a degree that can counteract the rising organic composition of capital. The current crisis  is  thus  'first  of  all  a  crisis  of  the  mode  of  labour  organization', expressing 'the limits to the increase in the rate of surplus-value that were inherent in the relations of production organized in this type of labour  process'. 92 Fordism  as  a  paradigm  for  organizing  the  labour process  could  henceforth  deliver  only  declining  productivity  growth because,  over  the  long  term,  management  exhausted  the  gains  that could  be  secured  from  an  intensification  of  labour  through  Taylorist time-and-motion studies,  job  fragmentation,  shopfloor  reorganization and  the  introduction  of  new  machinery  on  the  basis  of  existing technology.  Meanwhile,  workers  found  themselves  deskilled  and alienated  to  the  point  that  they  no  longer  delivered  the  on-the-line technical  innovations  crucial  to  the  growth  of  productiveness.  As  a result: 'The  development  of  the  department  producing  means  of production  encounters  a  constraint,  since  it  no  longer  gives  rise  to technical  mutations  leading  to  a  further  mechanization  of  labour, capable  of  generating  a  sufficient  saving  in  direct  labour  time  to compensate  for  the  increase  in  the  organic  composition  of  capital.' 94 For the Regulationists, then, the crisis of the Fordist mode of development manifested itself in a crisis of productivity, built into the sociotechnical  character  of  the  Fordist  labour  process  itself.  This  led  to economic  crisis  by  bringing  about  a  sharp  fall  in  the  rate  of  profit from 1966 onwards.

## 2 . From an 'Exhaustion of Fordism' to Capitalist Crisis?

The  relationship,  in  the  Regulationists'  framework,  between  their crisis  originating in the uneven development of Departments I and II from 1958 and their crisis originating in productivity-growth decline from 1966 is  not  entirely  clear.  Aglietta  argues  that  accumulation became unbalanced in the 1958-66 period  because  unit  labour  costs decreased too rapidly, bringing about increases in the rate of surplusvalue and the rate of profit that were too large because they involved a rate of growth of Department I vis-à-vis Department II that required unsustainable increases in the demand for capital goods. Yet, Aglietta also  argues  that  the  decline  in  the  rate  of  productivity  growth  from 1966 ,  which reflected the failure of technical change to keep up with the growth of capital (organic composition) and brought a slowdown in the rate of decrease of unit labour costs, was problematic because it resulted  in  a  decline  in  the  rate  of  profit.  The  immediate  question, therefore, is why the slower increase in labour productivity should not have ultimately benefited capital accumulation by reducing the rate of surplus-value  and  the  rate  of  profit,  thereby  decreasing  the  rate  of capital  accumulation  and  thus  the  level  of  demand  for  capital  goods required to maintain balanced growth of Departments I and II, in this way  resolving  the  problem  set  off  by  the  uneven  development  of Department I. Aglietta, in other words, makes a decline in the rate of profit,  resulting  from  lower  productivity  growth,  problematic  from 1966 ,  when he has made an increase in the rate of profit problematic in the period immediately before. Aglietta may be having too much of a good thing, playing both sides of his tightrope against the middle.

The tendency of recent  Regulationist  writing  has  been  to  ignore  the issue  of  unbalanced accumulation in the years 1958-66 and to interpret  the  current  crisis  in  terms  of  declining  marginal  productivity  of capital  within  the  Fordist  labour  process  beginning  in 1966 .  Nevertheless, the idea that the current crisis of profitability is derived from a decline in productivity growth resulting from the exhaustion of the Fordist technological paradigm is highly paradoxical-in view of the Regulationists'  own  characterization  of  the  [Taylorist]-Fordist  labour process,  in  view  of  what  we  thought  we  knew  about  technological change  under  capitalism,  and  in  view  of  the  actual  contours  of  the crisis itself, its timing, scope and intensity.

As  has  been  seen,  Aglietta  and  the  Regulationists  characterize  the Fordist  labour  process  as  a  development  on  machine  manufacturing (or  machinofacture).  As  Leborgne  and  Lipietz  put  it:  'As  a  general principle of organization of labour or 'technological paradigm', Fordism  is  nothing  more  than  Taylorism  plus  mechanization .' Thus  FordistTaylorist principles involve:

- a  rigorous  standardization  of  operating  practices  and  a  corresponding separation between [. . .] conception (design, engineering) on the one hand and manual manufacturing on the other hand. [. . .] This rationalization through separation has two objectives. The first is to implement [. . .] the most efficient method (the 'one best way') and to eliminate both experimentation  [. . .]  and  malfunctioning  along  the  workbenches  [. . .]  to obtain gains in productivity and its strict meaning (the physical efficiency of

each operation) by the organized socialization of collective learning by doing. The second objective [. . .] is to obtain, through knowledge of the time needed to carry out each operation, rigorous control of the intensity of  the  operative's  work  [. . .] True  Fordism can  be  distinguished  from Taylorism in the fact that these norms themselves are incorporated in the automatic apparatus of the machine. 95

But  if  Fordism  is  nothing  more  than  mechanization  plus  Taylorism plus the assembly-line-for the purposes specified by the Regulationists-it  is  difficult  to  see  why  it  should  be  viewed  as  more  than  an extension  of  the  processes  of  transforming  technology  and  the  labour process that have characterized capitalist production for at least a century (or perhaps two). In that case, why should machine manufacturing suddenly, in the mid 1960 s, have reached a limit and ceased to be able  to  yield  former  levels  of  productivity  growth,  precipitating  a crisis of the whole capitalist system.

Machinofacture,  it  should  be  remembered,  is  itself,  conceptually  and historically,  the  culmination  of  manufacture  per  se,  the  breaking  up of  complex,  skilled  tasks  into  their  simplified,  deskilled  component parts  (detailed  labour).  The  application  of  manufacturing  methods, according  to  Adam  Smith  and  Karl  Marx,  was  designed  to  bring about  cost  savings  by  rendering  learning-by-doing  easier,  by  making labour  more  continuous,  by  reducing  expenditures  on  the  imparting of  skills,  and  by  facilitating  the  introduction  of  machines  in  consequence of the simplification  of  tasks.  Mechanization  yielded  gains  in output/head  not  only  by  embodying  new  techniques  that  directly increased  the  efficiency  of  production,  but  also  by  increasing  the intensity  and  continuousness  of  labour  (filling  up  the  pores  of  the working  day).  The  increased  separation  of  conception  and  execution would afford a higher level of capitalist domination of the labour process. Mechanization  was,  moreover,  itself  subject  to  improvement according  to  the  principles  of  manufacturing  in  general-that  is, decomposition and simplification-which made it possible to use less skilled labour, to train labour more easily, and to intensify the actual performance  of  labour.  The  innovations  attributed  to  Taylorization by  the  Regulationists  would  seem,  rather  clearly,  then,  to  represent merely  variations  on  a  long-established  and  very  difficult-to-exhaust 'technological paradigm'.

In  this  context,  it  is  rather  difficult  to  know  what  to  make  of  the

Regulationist idea of an exhaustion of the gains to be had from Fordism. That one should expect diminishing returns from the adoption of any given machine-manufacturing  technique  makes  a  certain  amount of sense. The gains to be had by breaking down a production process into its simplified component parts/tasks may thus tend to be diminishing for any particular technique: there is perhaps only so much one can get from simplifying and deskilling a given labour process so as to reduce the requisite investment in 'human capital'; there are perhaps only  finite  gains  possible  from  the  further  mechanization  that  can result  from  such  simplification  and  deskilling.  However,  a  great  deal of  further  argumentation  and  evidence  would  be  required  to  show that,  after  some  given  point  in  history,  machinofacture in  generalin contrast  to  particular  mechanized  manufacturing  processes-should yield diminishing returns. It is in the essence of a capitalist economy that, under the pressure of competition, entirely new tools, embodying new techniques, will be brought in to carry out old processes.  It  is  also  in  the  essence  of  a  capitalist  economy  that  entirely new products will regularly be introduced to fulfil old or new needs, probably involving at least some degree of innovation in production. These new techniques will, in their turn, eventually be subject to simplification  and  deskilling,  to  Taylorization  broadly  conceived,  but also to replacement by new products and processes, and so on ad infinitum . It is interesting to note that F.W . Taylor himself was obsessively concerned with the improvements that could be had through reorganization of the labour process, rather than through the introduction of new  technology. 96 But  since  new  technologies  are  central  to  the ongoing  transformation  of  production,  there  seems  no  reason  to expect that an 'exhaustion of the Fordist labour process' would lead to a  generalized  crisis  bound  up  with  declining  rates  of  productivity growth.

If  the  Regulationists  continue  to  advance  this  thesis,  then,  it  would appear  to  be  because  they  tend  to  interpret  technological  change  in general,  and  mechanization  in  particular,  as  if  they  were  simply  processes by which the workers' knowledge and energy in production are appropriated  by  capital  under  the  pressure  of  class  struggle.  According to Aglietta:

[T]he capitalist mode of production has systematically brought into being systems of productive forces able to link absolute and relative surplusvalue closely together. Their basis is the principle of mechanization [Aglietta's emphasis], which incorporates in its mode of operation the qualitative characteristics of those concrete labours previously performed by the dexterity of workers . The machine system is a complex of productive forces in which a series of tools is set in motion by a mechanical source of energy, the motor. [. . .] By

96 Montgomery, Fall of the House of Labor , p. 233 . 'Taylor and his disciples had virtually nothing t 0 say [at this point] about what different machinery might do for efficiency. Their  thinking  was  riveted  on  commandeering  the  craftsman's  knowledge.'  In contrast,  '[T]he  Chicago-based  journal Factory . . . abounded  with  'trips  through  the world's  great  factories'  and  articles  on  electric  motors,  new  milling  machines,  hoists, cranes,  fire  prevention,  cost  analysis,  time  card  belting,  and  plant  layouts-but  not pay  systems  or  functional  foremanship.'  (Of  course,  as  Montgomery  explains,  Taylor had  himself  earlier  made  spectacularly  important  technical  contributions.  See  above, footnote 23 .)

transferring the qualitative characteristics of labour to the machine , mechanization reduces labour to a cycle of repetitive movements that is characterized solely by its duration, the output norm. This is the foundation of the homogenization of labour in production. All modifications in the organization of work represent a further expression of this principle .

More  baldly  put,  ' 'technology'  is  nothing  but  the  embodiment  of skilled  activity  into  machinery.' 97 These  formulations  tend  to  reduce technological  change  in  general,  and  mechanization  in  particular,  to an aspect of the class struggle, carried out by capital for the purpose of  reducing  workers'  control  so  as  to  increase  workers'  exploitability, especially  through  the  intensification  of  labour  (but  also  presumably the limitation of wage increases). 98 Such a vision helps make sense of the  Regulationists'  argument,  noted  earlier,  that  the  craft-controlled labour  process  could  so  fetter  capitalist  manufacturing  as  to  prevent significant  increases  in  the  organic  composition  of  capital  and  productiveness  for  three-quarters  of  a  century,  and  correlatively,  that, following  capital's epoch-making  victory  over  skilled  labour,  the introduction of the Taylorist labour process could facilitate revolutionary gains for capital. The same conception also informs the thesis that concerns us now: namely, that the gains from Taylorizing/ Fordizing  the  labour  process-secured  largely  through  deskilling, mechanization,  and  speedup  (though  also  learning-by-doing)-are exhausted. But it is, to say the least, extremely one-sided.

Mechanization  has,  of  course,  as  the  Regulationists  emphasize,  very much  facilitated  increased  surplus  extraction  through  weakening skilled  workers'  power  on  the  shop  floor  (and  beyond),  thus  making possible  the  intensification  of  labour  and,  more  generally,  capitalists' ability  to  secure  increased  worker  inputs,  and  thus  outputs,  for  the same wage. Yet, it has also introduced incalculable-and accelerating -increases  in  productiveness  (and  thereby  increases  in  relative surplus-value)  by  incorporating  advances  in  scientific  and  technical understanding,  achieved  to  some  extent  by  skilled  operatives,  but, increasingly  in  recent  times,  by  applied  scientists  and  engineers-an aspect of mechanization that the Regulationists very much play down in  framing  their  view  of  the  current  crisis  as  a  crisis  of  productivity. Since  just  after  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century,  an  increasing

proportion  of  technological  change  has  been  dependent  upon  prior advances  in  systematized  knowledge,  based  on  the  improved  understanding of the forces of nature achieved beyond the production process itself. Today, some of the most spectacular sources of productivity increase  within  Fordist  manufacturing  itself  are  obviously  sciencebased-cads,  cams,  robotics,  and  so  on.  Moreover,  beyond  manufacturing narrowly conceived, there have emerged a whole series of new industries-the computer revolution, biotechnology, materials, etc.which can in no obvious way be seen to represent the mechanization of  production  formerly  done  by  hand.  In  view  of  the  quite  massive extent  to  which  technical  change  in  production  can  be  seen  to  be independent not merely of the Taylorist-Fordist assembly line but of machinofacture itself, it is hard to understand on what basis the Regulationists could look to explain a productivity crisis in manufacturing in terms of a crisis of the Fordist labour process. 99

## 3. To What Extent Can a Crisis of Productivity, Derived from a Crisis of the Fordist Labour Process, Account for the Current Capitalist Crisis?

Even  if we  were  to  believe  that  a long-term  trend  toward  the exhaustion  of  the  Fordist  technological  paradigm  caused  a  decline  in productivity growth, it would still not satisfactorily explain the onset of the profitability crisis that the Regulationists rightly see as the root of the current situation. More specifically, it could not account for the simultaneous and general character of the crisis on an international scale, the suddenness of  its  onset,  and  the  extreme sharpness and depth of  the fall, marking a clear discontinuity with previous trends.

All of the advanced capitalist economies began to experience the crisis of profitability at virtually the same time, in the years between 1966 and 1970 ,  and  since  then  all  have  experienced  its  various  stages  in virtual lockstep. The profit rate began to fall in 1966-67 in the United States, 100 and  only  a  year  or  two  later  in  both  Japan  and  Germany. Up to 1974-75 profits  plummeted  everywhere,  with  the  drop-off  in Japan at least equalling that of the United States. Henceforward, the successive booms and busts were likewise marked by their synchrony. The  question  which  must  be  asked  of  the  Regulationists,  then,  is whether it is at all likely that such a generalized crisis could actually express separate but essentially identical trends of productivity, based on  essentially  parallel  evolutions  of  technology  in  relationship  to socioeconomic institutions in every advanced capitalist nation. 101

It  is  not  at  all  easy  to  see  why  different  industries-Fordist  or  nonFordist-built at different  times,  with  different  machinery,  and  with

different  growth  paths  reflecting  divergent  trends  in  demand  and capital  spending,  should  have  experienced  sharply  declining  productivity at  the  same  time ; nor  why  this  should  have  been  true  of  whole manufacturing  economies  with  such  distinct  postwar  experiences, structured by such specific institutional frameworks. The US economy was essentially  rebuilt  during  World  War  II  and  in  its  aftermath.  In contrast, the Japanese manufacturing economy did not really begin to be reconstructed until the mid 1950 s or so and was thus able to start from  significantly  more  modern  techniques  than  were  in  place  in the  US,  not  to  mention  its  more  powerful  institutions  supporting capital  investment  and  technical  advance.  Moreover,  the  Japanese economy, over the quarter-century from 1950 ,  and  beyond,  increased its  fixed  capital  at  more  than  twice  the  US rate  and  its  productivity  three  times  faster.  If  the  two  economies  nevertheless  underwent major declines in profitability at more or less the same time, is it at all  likely  that  these  were  both  caused  by  simultaneous  large-scale drops in efficiency?

Not only was the fall in the rate of profit synchronized internationally, it  also  involved  a  sharp  discontinuity.  Between 1950 and 1966 ,  the manufacturing profit rate adjusted for capacity utilization was stable; but from 1966 to 1974 it fell precipitately. By what possible mechanism  could  a  decline  in  productivity  increase  that  was  ostensibly  the result  of  the  declining  capacity  of  a  technological  paradigm  to  produce productivity growth take place so as to produce that profitability pattern? Even if one could somehow expect similar patterns of Fordist industrial development to lead to relatively synchronized productivity falls  across  industries  and  across  nations,  it  would  seem reasonable to expect that such declines would occur gradually and be spread over a significant time period. 102

Finally,  manufacturing  profitability  in  the  United  States  was  cut  in half between 1966 and 1974 : that is, investments in labour plus machinery plus circulating capital became fifty-per-cent less profitable than they had been just a few years before. It is very difficult to understand how the growth of economic efficiency could have declined so abruptly as to cause such a huge drop in the rate of return, let alone to see it as the result of a long-term exhaustion of the Fordist labour process.

## Was There a Crisis of Productivity Growth?

In  order  to  substantiate  their  case,  the  Regulationists  would  at  the very least have to show that there actually was a decline in the rate of

productivity increase behind the decline in the rate of profit. But this is  hardly  borne  out  by  an  examination  of  the  historical  record  in manufacturing,  necessarily  the  locus  of  any  exhaustion  of  Fordism. This sector suffered a decline in profitability in the first phase of the crisis  significantly  greater  than  that  for  the  economy  as  a  whole:  its rate of profit fell from a peak of 12 per cent in 1965 to around 10 per cent in 1966 and around 4 per cent in 1970 , with a rise to 6 per cent in 1973 and then a further fall to under 3 per cent in 1974 ; in the same period, the average rate of return on assets in the non-financial business sector fell from around 12 5 . per cent in 1966 to around 6 75 . per cent  in 1974 103 . Nevertheless,  figures  provided  by  Bowles,  Gordon and  Weisskopf  show  that,  over  the  years 1966-73 ,  labour  productivity actually rose by an annual average of 3 3 . per cent in the manufacturing sector as compared to 2 9 . per cent over the years 1948-66 104 . Moreover,  if  one  makes  use  of  what  appear  to  be  the  best  available productivity  indices-the  direct-quantity  indices  compiled  by  the Federal  Reserve  Board  only  for  the  manufacturing  sector,  rather  than the deflated value indices produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics -the  increase  in  the  productivity  growth-rate  in  manufacturing during  the  first  phase  of  the  profitability  crisis  appears  to  be  even greater. The  Federal  Reserve  Board's  figures  show  manufacturing productivity rising at an annual rate of 4 24 . per cent for the years of rapidly  falling  manufacturing  profitability 1966-73 ,  in  comparison with an annual rate of 2 65 . per cent over the boom period 1948-66 105 .

In  response  to  the  figures  showing  an  increase  in  the  growth-rate  of manufacturing labour productivity for the period of falling profitability, Regulation  School  theorists  have  pointed  out  that  the  capital/labour ratio grew even faster. Whereas the growth of manufacturing productivity was about 1 6 . times faster over the period 1966-73 than over the period 1948-66 ,  the  growth  of  the  capital/labour  ratio  was  twice  as fast. These data could be interpreted as expressing a fall in overall productivity  growth,  such  that  workers  achieved  less  increase  in  output than before from a similar increase of capital at their disposal. 106

What,  then, were the  productivity  trends,  taking  capital,  not  just labour, inputs into account? Kendrick and Grossman and Gollop and Jorgenson  provide  figures  indicating  that  the  rate  of  growth  of total factor productivity did fall significantly in the period of falling profit rate  after  the  mid 1960 s,  in  comparison  with  the  period  of  rising profitability from the late 1950 s to the mid 1960 s. 107 Nevertheless, this

First of all, while it is true that growth in total factor productivity was lower in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s than in the immediately preceding period of high boom, the fact is that its growth over the whole period from 1960 to 1973 was significantly higher than in any other period since World War II. This would seem directly to contradict the Regulationist  hypothesis  that  productivity  decline  resulted  from  the growing  failure  of  the  Fordist  technological  paradigm.  Furthermore, the lack of correlation during the postwar period between profitability -which was high until the mid sixties and thenceforth in decline-and total factor productivity-which, as here measured, was low until the early  sixties  and  high  thereafter-casts  serious  doubt  on  the  whole idea that a fall in productivity for the period immediately after 1966 was responsible for the profitability decline. In fact, when the figures on total factor productivity are adjusted for capacity utilization-that is,  to  take  account  of  the  capital  actually  used  in  production,  rather than  that  merely  in  place-there  simply  is  no  decline  in  total  factor productivity growth in the period of falling and low profitability from 1966 to 1974 in  comparison  to  that  in  the  period  of  increasing  and high profitability from 1948 to 1966 .  As  Kendrick's and Grossman's conclusion is that 'the farm and manufacturing sectors showed no statistically significant decline in their productivity trends since 1966 '. 108

## VI Conclusion

The  general  weakness  of  Regulation  Theory,  paradoxical  though  this may  seem,  is  its  failure  to  take  adequately  into  account  the  broader system  of  capitalist  social-property  relations  that  forms  the  backdrop to  their  succession  of  institutionally  defined  phases.  The  Regulationists want to develop a set of historically founded concepts as intermediate links between high theory and economic history and, in particular, to demonstrate that the institutional evolution of capitalism is the key to  its  history.  Their  key  intermediate  notion  is  the  mode  of  development, constituted by a mode of regulation and a regime of accumulation.

But since each mode of development must represent a phase within the evolution of, and thus a variation upon, the capitalist mode of production per se, 109 it would appear necessary to understand the emergence, the reproduction, and the effects of the modes of regulation that guide each regime of accumulation at least partly in terms of the general constraints constituted by capitalist social-property relations. This is, first of  all,  because  capitalist  social-property  relations,  once  established, impose  on  the  individual  economic  units  or  actors  certain  necessary forms of economic behaviour-maximization of the price/cost ratio for the sale of their goods by appropriately specializing, by accumulating surpluses,  and  by  bringing  in  the  latest  technique,  on  pain  of  going out  of  business  under  the  pressure  of  competition.  The  aggregate developmental  tendencies  that  result-tendencies  for  medium-run prices  to  reflect  costs  of  production,  for  rates  of  profit  in  different lines  of  production  to  equalize,  for  obsessive  capital  accumulation, and  for  the  unprecedented  development  of  the  productive  forcesdistinguish  capitalism  from  all  other  types  of  economy.  Secondly, capitalist  social-property  relations,  once  established,  form  a  sort  of field  of  natural  selection  for  the  emergence  and  reproduction  of  historically  specific  economic  institutions  themselves.  The  failure  of  the Regulationists,  in  practice,  to  take  adequate  account  of  these  general and  distinctive  features  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production,  lies behind very many of the central conceptual and empirical weaknesses in the theory that we have tried to bring out in the course of this essay.

## Social-Property Relations or Institutions?

The insensitivity of the Regulationists to the distinction between the effects  on  the  pattern  of  capital  accumulation  that  they  attribute  to different institutions within capitalism and the effects attributable to the  broader  framework  of  social-property  relations,  capitalist  or  precapitalist  (or  non-capitalist),  is  manifest  in  the  very  modes  of  regulation  and  development  that  the  Regulationists  identify.  Although they do not make much of it, they identify an 'ancient' or 'traditional' mode  of  regulation,  supposedly  preceding  the  competitive  mode  of regulation,  in  which  'the  agricultural  sector  plays  a  dominant  role, since  modern  capitalist  industry  is  only  emerging.  This  produces  a unique  cyclical  pattern:  every  bad  harvest  leads  to  soaring  prices  of corn  and  more  generally  agricultural  prices;  hence  peasants  cannot buy  industrial  goods  and  the  industrial  sector  is  hit  by  the  second round  of  crisis;  then  workers  are  fired  and  the  nominal  wage  is lowered even if the general price level is climbing. The 'regulation' is by  nature stagflationist , since  it  associates  unemployment  with  inflation.' 110 But the obvious problem here is that the developmental pattern  to  which  the  Regulationists  refer-originally  identified  by  the French  economic  historian  C.-E.  Labrousse-is  inexplicable  in  terms of a properly capitalist network of institutions that could constitute a mode of regulation.

Prevailing not only in France before the Revolution, but also throughout  much  of  Europe  during  the  medieval  and  early-modern  period and beyond, the social-structural roots of the (mis-termed) ancient or traditional  mode of development were to be found in the precapitalist social  formations  of  that  epoch,  specifically  in  the  dominance  of  a structure  in  which  peasant  property  was  a  central  element.  Because peasants possessed their means of subsistence, they were not dependent upon  the  market,  so  were  not  required  to  maximize  their  price/cost ratio  by  specializing,  by  innovating,  by  improving,  or  by  moving  to the line with the best rate of return. They tended instead to adopt as their rule for reproduction  'production  for  subsistence'-that  is, diversifying production to cover necessities and marketing only physical  surpluses.  The  agricultural  productive  forces  therefore  tended  to stagnate and productivity to decline over the long run with the growth of  population.  The  outcome  was  a  built-in  vulnerability  to  harvest failures, which tended to occur in bunches, bringing on 'crises of subsistence'  characterized  by  the  sudden,  extreme  increase  in  prices  that are a distinctive feature of the Regulationists 'ancient' or 'traditional' mode of development. The key to the ensuing pattern of crisis was to be found in the peasants' response to high prices.

Since  peasants  were  not  required  to  increase  productiveness  to  maximize returns, and were anyway not very capable of doing so, they did not much raise output in response to high prices (as capitalist farmers would have done). Producing only limited output for the market, and purchasing  only  limited  inputs  from  it,  the  peasants  were,  correlatively, unable to gain much in income and purchasing power in consequence of the high prices (as again market-dependent capitalist farmers  would have been able to do). High grain prices therefore reduced the  discretionary  purchasing  power  of  workers  while  failing  to increase  the  discretionary  purchasing  power  of  peasants;  total  industrial  demand and industrial wages fell, unemployment rose, yet agricultural prices remained high over a period of several years (the Regulationists' 'stagflation'). 111 It should thus be evident how misleading it is to refer to an ancient or traditional 'mode of regulation' as conceptually  equivalent  to  the  'competitive'  and  'monopoly'  modes; 112 or  to imply that the aforementioned pattern of development is explained in terms of a historically  specific  network  of  capitalist  institutions  (that could  constitute  a  mode  of  regulation).  The  ancient  or  traditional pattern of development is incomprehensible as a function of capitalist institutional  forms  of  any  sort,  but  must,  on  the  contrary,  be  understood  as  the  effect  of  a  system  of  social-property  relations  quite  distinct from those of capitalism.

It  may  seem  pedantic  to  tax  the  Regulationists  for  this  misleading

conceptualization  of  historically  rather  distant  patterns  of  development.  Their  project  is,  after  all,  to  demonstrate  the  significance  of varying networks of institutional forms for variations in the pattern of capital accumulation within capitalism . 113 The point we wish to stress, however,  is  that  their  failure  adequately  to  distinguish  between  the economic effects of a broad framework of pre-capitalist social-property relations  and  those  of  properly  capitalist  institutions  undermines  the Regulationists' entire theoretical edifice, for it leads them to propose an untenable theorization of the history of capitalism per se from the mid-nineteenth century to the late 1960 s.

On  the  one  hand,  as  we  have  tried  to  demonstrate,  in  so  far  as  the Regulationists  identify  historical  cases  of  the  regime  of  intensive accumulation, and supply a convincing theoretical account-and they barely begin to do so-their explanation must rely on the effects not of properly capitalist institutions, as is called for by their theory, but on the  broader  framework  of  pre-capitalist  social-property  relations  that shaped  manufacturing  development.  What,  specifically,  appears responsible for the pattern of accumulation identified by the Regulationists  as  characterized  predominantly by absolute surplus value and restricted  mass  consumption  is  a  socioeconomic  environment  composed of only partially proletarianized peasant agricultural producers, available for industrial employment on the basis of cheap wages. This offered  only  restricted  potential  for  the  growth  of  collective  labour, thus  of  consistent  productivity  advance  and  accumulation  on  the basis of relative surplus-value,  and  very  limited  possibilities for growth of the home market. 114

On the other hand, in so far as the Regulationists refer to the effects of a  specific  set  of  specifically  capitalist  institutions  to  explain  how  the competitive mode of regulation could so fetter the growth of the productive  forces  as  to  structure  a  pattern  of  predominantly  extensive accumulation-and  why  a  breakthrough  to  monopolistic  regulation was  necessary  to  make  possible  stable  intensive  accumulation-their arguments  are  vitiated  precisely  by  their  systematic  neglect  of  the overriding effects of the broader structure of capitalist social-property relations, especially the built-in competitive constraint. The economic tendencies or pressures they attribute to the presence of given institutions  are  thus  either  overridden  by  counter-tendencies  inherent  in capitalist  social-property  relations  per  se  or,  in  consequence  of  those relations,  have  insufficiently  broad  and  long-lasting  effects  to  determine a whole distinctive regime of capital accumulation.

The Regulationists make the justifiable point that the risk associated

113 Although it must be added that their positing of a 'scarcity' mode of regulation (to comprehend Eastern Europe and the USSR) that possesses the same conceptual status as the  competitive  and  the  monopoly-as  well  as  the  traditional/ancient-modes  of regulation  hardly  inspires  confidence.  See  Boyer,  'Wage/Labour  Relations,  Growth and Crisis',  p. 9 .  It  should  be  evident  that  what  has  obtained  in  Eastern  Europe  and the USSR is not an institutionally specific variant of capitalism (capitalism here defined in terms of commodity production and wage labour, with labour-power as a commodity), but quite another type of system of social-property relations, which itself displays institutional variations according to time and place.

with a highly competitive environment tends to discourage innovations that depend on increasingly large-scale placements of fixed capital. But they seem to ignore the equally obvious point that a highly competitive environment will make those same investments unavoidable for firms wishing to survive and, in the medium run, will stimulate institutional innovations  that  enhance  the  capacity  of  firms  to  cope  with  risk. 115 Similarly, the Regulationists not unreasonably propose that, so long as it is  maintained , the  craft-controlled  labour  process  can  limit  mechanization  and  productivity  growth.  The  problem  is  that  the  productive relations of the labour process to which they here refer are constituted within the firm , subject to competition from other cost-cutting firms. It is theoretically conceivable that trade unions, organizing (part of ) the working  class  beyond  the  individual  units,  could  have  secured  the reproduction of craft control within the individual units precisely by exercising their collective power through-out the whole of an industry and  so  countering  the  competitive  pressure  on  firms  to  pursue  technological  rents  (temporary  superprofits)  via  innovation  and  to  copy innovating competitors. In practice, however, unions would have faced insurmountable  difficulties  in  exerting  such  wide-reaching  and  durable  power  as  to  dictate  predominantly  extensive  accumulation  for  a whole  economy  over  a  whole  epoch. 116 Finally,  and  analogously,  the Regulationists emphasize that a highly competitive labour market will tend to limit aggregate consumption by restricting wage gains, and that restricted  growth  of  aggregate  consumption  will  tend  to  discourage productivity-enhancing capital investments in Department II. But they seem to neglect the equally obvious counter-tendencies for competition among  accumulating,  cost-cutting  firms  on  the  product  and  labour markets  to  stimulate  the  growth  of  mass  consumption,  not  only  by bringing about the increased employment of wage workers and growing wages, but also by stimulating cost-cutting technical changes that themselves widen the market by making for reduced prices. 117

## France and the United States

That the Regulationists' preoccupation with middle-range theory and the  primacy  of  institutions  actually  does  lead  them  to  neglect  the historically  specific  framework  of  social-property  relations  in  which manufacturing develops and to misapprehend the effects of the capitalist institutions constituting their modes of regulation is evident in their practical application  of their own  concepts-specifically,  in their  rather  astonishing  notion  that  the  economic  histories  of  both France  and  the  United  States  since  roughly  the  second  third  of  the nineteenth  century  can  be  grasped  by  the  same  schema  of  phases. 118 The  economic  trajectories  of  these  two  nations  differed  so  dramatically during the specified period as to demand, on even the most superficial  viewing,  far  more  a  theorization  of  their  systematic  divergence than  a  conceptualization  of  an  imagined  commonality.  Shaped  by radically different frameworks  of  social-property  relations,  not  to mention  divergent  responses  to  the  same  international  competitive

environment, they can be interpreted as manifesting the same dynamics only in consequence of prior theoretical commitments.

In France, something resembling what the Regulationists refer to as a regime of extensive accumulation does seem to have prevailed through most of the nineteenth century. But there is little reason to believe that this had anything to do with the predominance of the capitalist institutions  of  the  competitive  mode  of  regulation.  To  an  important degree,  the  framework  for  the  development  of  French  manufacturing was  a  system  of  social-property  relations  in  much  of  agriculture  that was  still  characterized  by  the  preponderance  of  small  peasant  ownerproducers significantly oriented to subsistence and semi-proletarianized peasants. This tended to limit the growth of agricultural productivity, to restrict  the  increase  of  the  home  market,  and  to  bias  manufacturing investment  toward  domestic  industry  based  on  semi-proletarianized peasants.  Correlatively,  for  much  of  industry  until  fairly  late  in  the nineteenth  century,  the  manufacturing  sector  was  only  to  a  small degree  penetrated  by  mechanized  factories  and  heavily  controlled  by petty  producers  and  small  artisanal  shops.  The  development  of  the French  economy  was,  finally,  further  crucially  cramped  throughout the period by its inability to compete with the British hegemon on the world market. 119

In  the  United  States,  in  contrast,  a  spectacular  process  of  intensive accumulation  involved  the  rapid  growth  of  fixed  capital,  labour  productivity and a mass market for Department II consumption goods, at least from the time of the Civil War. This took place despite the predominance of what the Regulationists term the institutions of competitive regulation-in the absence, that is, of the institutions establishing the  (Fordist)  norm  of  working-class  consumption,  supposedly  indispensable  for  viable  intensive  accumulation,  and  in  the  presence  of  a high  level  of  inter-capitalist  competition.  The  socioeconomic  framework for manufacturing development was a fully capitalist system of social-property  relations,  above  all  in  agriculture,  which  experienced especially dynamic growth and played an especially critical role. By the end  of  the  century,  it  was  the  manufacturing  sector  located  in  Great Britain, much more than that in the United States, that had to be concerned about the distribution of international competitiveness. 120

Paths of capital accumulation, it may be concluded, are simply incomprehensible apart from a specification of the broader system of socialproperty  relations  in  which  they  are  embedded.  This  is  not  only because those systems will define the range of economic strategies that individual  economic  actors  can  find  it  sensible  to  adopt;  it  is  also because  those  systems  constitute  a  field  of  natural  selection  for  the adoption  of  institutions  and  heavily  determine  the  effect  of  given institutions,  once  adopted,  on  capital  accumulation.  What  this  turns out to mean, in practice, is that paths of industrial development can

be  expected  to  vary  fundamentally  according  to  whether  they  are framed  by  fully  capitalist  or  non-capitalist  agrarian  social-property relations (and, if the latter, according to what type), even in the presence of roughly similar capitalist institutions . The  contrasting  evolutions, between 1850 and 1920 , of manufacturing in Russia and Japan or the US South  and  the  US North-or  France  and  the  United  Statesprovide striking illustration of this point.

## Phases of National Capitalist Development? The World Economy

If  one  takes  seriously  the  manner  and  degree  to  which,  not  only  the broader framework of social-property relations, but also the nature of the  world  economy,  shapes  local  processes  of  capital  accumulation, the  project  of  conceptualizing  the  history  of  capitalism  as  a  progression of institutionally determined, nationally situated modes of development  appears  even  more  problematic.  This  is  because  the  given international distribution of productive power will have a central role in  determining  what  institutions  are  even  viable  within  national economies at a given historical juncture, as well as what will be their effect on capital accumulation, since, unless they are shielded in some way,  these  institutions  must  directly  respond  to  international  competition. Focusing as they do on the regulation of national economies as a whole, Regulation theorists have not devoted a great deal of attention to institutional innovations that take place in a partial way, at the level of individual units of capital-the corporate form, vertical integration,  horizontal  integration,  forms  of  merger  of  bank  and  manufacturing  capital,  and  the  like.  But  it  does  not  seem  controversial  to say  that  such  institutions  have,  in  an  important  sense,  succeeded  in establishing  themselves  because,  and  worked  their  positive  economic effects on the development of the productive forces to the degree that, they  have  made  for  increased  competitiveness  of  the  associated  productive units-in competitive war with other productive units shaped by  other  institutional  forms  elsewhere.  In  practice,  institutions emerge  and  reproduce  themselves  within  local-regional  or  national -settings  as  a  function,  in  important  respects,  of  the  institutions already extant on a world scale: they are constructed so as to emulate or  surpass  institutions  in  place  elsewhere  in  promoting  competitiveness in production. The same local institutional forms will constitute either  stimuli  or  fetters  for  the  development  of  the  productive  forces depending on the state of the distribution of productive power in the world  economy  as  a  whole-by  which  is  simply  meant  the  distribution among nations or regions of technological capacity embedded in fixed capital and the skilled labour and institutional ability to use it. The reason  for  this  is  that  the  capacity  of  institutions  to  further  the development of the productive forces is strictly relative to their competitiveness, which obviously depends not only on their own absolute effectiveness  but  on  institutionally  based  productive  power  elsewhere -witness the small, specialized firms and craft-controlled labour process emerging in Britain in the first half of the nineteenth century; the modern  vertically  integrated  corporation  directly  managing  the labour  process  in  relationship  to  industrial  unions  that  developed  in the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the United States; and the state-aided keiretsu and single-firm unions of postwar Japan.

The upshot should be clear: the economic viability and effects of networks  of  local  institutional  forms  (modes  of  regulation)  will  heavily depend on the stage of development of the world economy in its multiple relationships to the non-capitalist world. No doubt, defined within that  context , institutions  have  proved,  and  will  continue  to  prove, extremely important in affecting regional or national paths of growth of the productive forces, especially through their impact on manufacturing  competitiveness:  variations  in  institutional  forms  across nations  and  regions  will,  in  other  words,  have  a  major  part  in  determining  the  hierarchies  of  productivity  and  competitiveness  among regions  and  nations.  Yet,  the  implications  of  that  conclusion  are  not entirely favourable to the Regulationists' project.

The point is  that,  while,  from  this  vantage  point,  it  is  reasonable  to expect  that  variations  in  the  institutional  framework,  properly defined,  will  lead  to  measurable  variations  in  rates  of  growth  of  the productive forces and relative competitiveness, it is also reasonable to expect that, within any given historical epoch in the history of capitalism,  local,  regional  and  national  economies  will  differ  very  greatly from  one  another  with  respect  to  their  institutional  frameworks  precisely  because,  as  the  Regulationists  emphasize,  these  frameworks  are the  outcome  of  quite  specific  processes  of  historical  evolution.  But how, in that case, can what the Regulationists term modes of development-that  is,  epochal  patterns  of  capital  accumulation  and  structural crisis-be  understood  primarily  in  institutional  terms?  For, what  is  striking  about  the  evolution  of  the  world  economy,  at  least since 1900 , is that its constituent local, regional and national elements have, for the most part, simultaneously gone through the same grand economic  phases.  Despite  the  great  differences  in  historically  given systems  of  social-property  relations,  forms  of  government,  economic institutions, and levels of technological development, essentially every part  of  the  capitalist  world  took  part,  though  not  to  the  very  same degree, in the unprecedented economic expansion of the epoch before World War I, was struck by the devastating interwar depression, partook  of  the  great  post-World  War  II  boom,  and  has  been  weighed down by the structural crisis that began in the late 1960 s. Despite the heterogeneous modes of regulation of its constituent parts, the world economy  as  a  whole  has  possessed  a  certain  homogeneity,  indeed unity, in terms of its succession of phases of development. The world economy has, it seems, been able to impose its quite general logic, if not  to  precisely  the  same  extent,  on  all  of  its  component  elements, despite their very particular modes of regulation. If we are to understand the complex operation of its parts, it is thus perhaps still indispensable to understand the functioning of the system as a whole, and this goes above all for the modes of development issuing in structural crisis that are at the core of the Regulationists' concern.

## The Wage-Labour Relation and Structural Crises

What gives the Regulationists' conceptualization of capitalist history its  apparent  comprehensiveness  and  powerful  internal  logic  is  their focus on  the  wage-labour  relationship,  specifically  the  capitalist labour  process  and  the  system  of  wage  determination  (or,  more

broadly, income distribution). 121 In  this  regard,  the  notion  of  Taylorism-Fordism functions as the conceptual linchpin of the Regulationists' entire succession of phases: for in each mode of development, the institutional forms of the labour process-pre-Taylorist, then TayloristFordist-and/or  the  wage  relation-pre-Fordist,  then  Fordist-first facilitate  then  fetter  the  accumulation  process,  leading  to  structural crisis and class conflict. It was thus the establishment of the TayloristFordist  labour  process  during  the  first  two  decades  of  the  twentieth century-itself an outcome of class conflict that reversed a balance of forces previously favourable to labour-which made possible a breakthrough beyond the regime of extensive accumulation of the Regulationists' first mode of development to intensive accumulation. But the persistence  of  the  institutions  of  competitive  wage  determination under  the  Regulationists'  second  mode  of  development,  expressing the too great power of capital over labour, fettered intensive accumulation  rooted  in  the  Taylorist-Fordist  labour  process  and  led  to  the structural crisis of underconsumption and the political conflicts of the interwar period. It was then the establishment of the Fordist mode of consumption, manifesting a class compromise that emerged from the sociopolitical conflicts of the thirties and forties, that allowed for the full  flowering  of  the  Taylorist-Fordist  labour  process  and  intensive accumulation  during  the  postwar  boom,  the  Regulationists'  third mode  of  development.  However,  the  Taylorist-Fordist  labour  process,  expressing  the  strength  of  labour  vis-à-vis  capital, 122 ultimately came to fetter the growth of the productive forces and issued in a new structural crisis of productivity growth from the late sixties onwards. It will, finally, be  a newly  constructed  labour  process,  beyond Taylorism-Fordism,  built  upon  a  new  class  compromise,  that  will make  possible  an  exit  from  the  current  economic  impasse,  presumably a new, post-Fordist fourth mode of development.

It has been the burden of our essay that each of the foregoing propositions-deriving  from  the  Regulationists'  one-sided  concentration upon  the  historically  specific  institutions  of  wage-labour  and  associated  balances  of  class power,  to  the  neglect  of  the  constraints imposed  by  capitalist  social-property  relations  in  general,  especially inter-capitalist competition-flies in the face of the fundamental realities  of  capitalist  development.  As  a  result,  the  whole  notion  of  Fordism, in both its supply-side and its demand-side aspects, is theoretically  incoherent  and  empirically  irrelevant,  and  provides  misleading perspectives on the nature of capitalist crises, past and present, on the historical  role  of  class  power  and  politics  in  precipitating  and  resolving  capitalist  crises,  and  on  contemporary  policy  options.  To  begin with: if the Regulationists are correct, the supply-side breakthrough to Taylorism-Fordism  on  the  shopfloor  (itself  perhaps  dependent  on  an accompanying  move  to  intra-capitalist  organization  on  the  basis  of oligopoly) was the sine qua non for the breakthrough beyond the Regulationists'  first  mode  of  development  to  accumulation  predominantly on the basis of relative surplus-value, that is, intensive accumulation. But, if this were so, we would have to accept the paradoxical conclusion

that  fully  developed  capitalism-before  the  Taylorist-Fordist  revolution at the level of the labour process (and the transcendence of fully fledged  inter-capitalist  competition)-was  incapable  of  developing, did  not  in  fact  historically  develop,  by  way  of  capital  accumulation based  on  relative  surplus-value.  We  would  also  have  to  believe  that, for a whole long epoch, the sheer class power of labour was sufficient to  insure  such  a  degree  of  craft  control  over  the  labour  process  as  to fetter  technical  change.  In  reality,  however,  the  capitalist  labour  process  cannot function as an economy-wide institutional constraint dictating a whole regime of accumulation and mode of development; on the  contrary,  the  labour  process  is  itself  regularly  (though  not  continuously)  transformed  in  consequence  of  capital  accumulation,  as technical change takes place under the impact of inter-capitalist competition,  making for  the  revolutionizing  of  the  productive  forces  and the growth of relative surplus-value.

In the Regulationists' second mode of development, competitive wage regulation is supposed to have fettered intensive accumulation by making  for  insufficient  demand  and  the  uneven  development  of  Department I, thereby precipitating structural crisis. Were this so, we would have  to  reach  the  conclusion  that  capitalism,  inherently  and  through most  of  its  history,  confronts  a  structural  crisis  of  underconsumption.  But  we  have  tried  to  show  that  the  Regulationists'  underlying underconsumptionist theory is flawed, as is clear from the long history of  capitalist  development on the basis of relative surplus-value in the absence  of  Fordist  institutions  of  mass  consumption,  notably  in  the United States, as well as from statistical material on the interwar crisis.

As  to  the  Regulationists'  third  mode  of  development:  the  establishment of Fordist institutions of mass consumption, especially collective bargaining, was supposed to have made for the great post-World War II boom. But if the source of the crisis of the 1930 s was not underconsumption, why should Fordist consumption have constituted its cure? Empirically, it is by no means clear that institutions were ever established in the United States that ensured, via collective bargaining, an economy-wide 'sharing out' of productivity gains to labour, and it is certain that in Japan, the nation which experienced the most successful  postwar  growth,  there  were  neither  such  institutions,  nor  such redistribution. 123 In fact the Regulationists, in all their writings, offer no other systemic  contradiction,  or  source  of  capitalist  crisis,  except 'the  uneven  development  of  Department  I'  and  underconsumption. The  Fordist/Keynesian  class-compromise  might  even  be  thought  to have  solved  capitalism's  problems . . . were  it  not  for  the  remaining difficulty in developing the productive forces that showed up with the current crisis. 124

Turning now to the Regulationists' analysis of the roots of the current economic crisis, these are supposed to be found in the 'exhaustion of

the  Taylorist-Fordist  labour  process'.  But  this  proposition  suffers from  the  same  fundamental  defect  that  we  saw  in  the  Regulationist account of earlier structural crises: namely, that the form of labour process-functioning  in  analogy  with  the  social-relations-of-production concept  in  the  Marxian  theory  of  modes  of  production-acts  (along with institutions distributing income) as the chief facilitator and, ultimately,  the  primary  fetter  on  the  growth  of  the  productive  forces. Thus, from a theoretical standpoint, we have asserted that the Regulationists' conception  tends:  (i)  misleadingly  to  reduce  technical advance  to  the  appropriation  by  capital  of  workers'  shopfloor  knowledge, control and energy; (ii) to mislocate the primary source, indeed meaning, of technical change in the struggle for class power, especially at  the  point  of  production;  and  (iii)  implicitly  to  misattribute  to capitalist-imposed technical change a unilateral or universal tendency to  deskilling,  playing  down  the  requirement  of  new  skills  that  often come with technical change. As a result, it vastly understates the central role played by the growth of technical and scientific understanding beyond the labour process, neglects the generalized, if not continuous, tendency  to  the  introduction  of  more  efficient  (increased  output  per given  input)  techniques  under  the  pressure  of  competition,  and  fails adequately to acknowledge the countertendency to reskilling resulting from technical change that is the consequence of capitalists' desire to adopt the most profitable technique, virtually irrespective of skill content. 125 In  particular,  although  we  would  not  deny  that  workers' separation from control over and knowledge of production, with their consequent  alienation  and  resistance,  is a factor that affects the growth of the productive forces, we would certainly dispute the Regulationist contention that this separation constituted a barrier to technical advance  sufficient  to precipitate a decline  in productivity growth capable of bringing on the current crisis of capitalism. Indeed, at  least  in  the  case  of  the  United  States,  which  experienced  the  economic  downturn  earliest  and  perhaps  most  profoundly  among  the OECD nations,  there  was  no  crisis  of  manufacturing  productivity  at the time of the initial decline in the rate of profit.

## Politics

Since the Regulationists find the ultimate source of the current crisis in  'the  crisis  of  'informal  involvement' '  of  workers  in  productionthe failure to secure their conscious, 'formal' commitment-it follows that  Lipietz  should  propose  an  'anti-Taylorian  revolution'  as  the  way out. This would bring into being a new class compromise that would secure, simultaneously, the socio-technical requirements for transcending the productivity crisis and the economic and political requirements for  society-wide  consent  and  stability.  Workers  would  offer  increased involvement in, and commitment to, improving production on the basis of the introduction of work teams; capitalists would provide guarantees of  employment, enriched jobs, and the further share-out of the gains from  increased  productivity  growth.  Such  an  agreement  would,  the Regulationists  believe,  constitute  a  positive-sum  solution,  in  which both labour and capital would benefit from a faster growing pie.

This  proposal  instantiates  the  Regulationists'  more  general  idea  that the resolution of secular capitalist crises requires a 'great compromise' among  the  different  social  classes,  by  which  a  'pattern  of  development'  is  broadly  accepted  as  the  'economic  basis  for  what  could  be considered  the  best  thing  humankind  may  expect  from  economic activity [at that historical juncture] and defended from the right and the  left.'  It  is  analogous  to  the  Regulationists'  understanding  of  the foundations for the postwar boom as constituted by a Rooseveltian or social-democratic compromise, in which capitalists acceded to the distribution to workers of wage gains in line with productivity increase, as  well  as  the  consolidation  of  the  welfare  state,  and  secured,  as  a result,  the  stable  demand  required  to  ward  off  crisis  and  to  create  a favourable  environment  for  massive  capital  investment. 126 Nevertheless, in light especially of our argument that the crisis of the 1930 s was not a crisis of underconsumption, it would seem to us to make better sense  to  say  the  converse:  namely,  that  the  onset  and  perpetuation  of the  boom  provided  the  indispensable  condition  for  the  Rooseveltian or social-democratic compromise, which could not be forged or stabilized  until  after  the  crisis  had  been  transcended.  By  the  same  token, because  the  Regulationists'  diagnosis  of  the  current  crisis  is  faulty, Lipietz's prescription  will not  work,  and  the  proposed  political bargain is therefore unviable.

The fundamental point, as we have tried to show, is that the source of the current crisis is not a problem of productivity growth: a decline in productivity increase did not bring on the crisis, so an improved rate of productivity  increase  cannot  restore  aggregate  profitability  and prosperity.  Even  if  workers'  involvement  were  increased  throughout the capitalist economy leading to increased productivity growth, capitalists,  facing  continuing  pressure  on  their  profits,  could  not,  even  if they wished to, viably promise workers, in exchange for involvement, secure  employment  and  enriched  jobs,  or  even  a  share  of  the  returns from  productivity  growth.  This  is  not  to  deny,  of  course,  that  firms that become relatively more productive than the average in their line (however  they  do  so)  will  be  relatively  better  able  to  insure  their workers' jobs. So will firms or units at the 'core' of an industry, where work has been increasingly contracted out, or in other ways peripheralized,  to  firms  with  increasingly  insecure  (and  otherwise  worse-off) workers. But in such cases, one group of workers is simply benefiting at the expense of another, within the context-so long as the crisis of profitability continues-of generalized, on average, deterioration. 127

In passing, it should be noted that Lipietz believes that there is a further, derivative

Perhaps  equally  to  the  point,  it  is  far  from  clear  that  capital  today requires  a  class  compromise  of  the  sort  mooted  by  the  Regulation School  to  continue  to  secure  sufficient, or even  significantly to increase,  productivity  growth.  The  Regulationists  believe  that  securing  consciously  organized  workers'  commitment  (as  opposed  to  the 'informed  involvement'  of  the  past)  is  the  key  to  transcending  the productivity  impasse.  But  they  also  contend  that  'an  involved  working  class  is  a  working  class  whose  know-how  is  accumulated  for  the benefit  both  of  firms  and  of  workers',  and  that  this  is  impossible  if there  is  no  'community  of  destiny  between  firms  and  their  workers,' for '[n]o worker would exercise his or her cooperative spirit in search of  gains  in  productivity  entailing  his  or  her  own  redundancy.' 128 In this  context,  the  Regulationists  describe  the  United  States  as  having adopted  a  'flexible  liberal',  as  opposed  to  a  'negotiated  involvement' response  to  the  productivity  crisis,  seeking  radically  to  cut  labour costs by eliminating job security, 'by out-sourcing, by transferring production  to  the  Third  World  and  increasing  the  level  of  automation', rather than pursuing 'a new 'social contract' ', in which wage-earners were  called  upon  to  join  'the  battle  for  quality  and  productivity'. 129 The  fact  remains,  however,  that,  despite  their  apparent  disdain  for creating  a 'community  of  destiny'  between  themselves  and  their employees, US manufacturing firms have during the period of secular crisis  been  able  to  increase  productivity  at  a  higher  rate  than  at  any other  time  during  the  postwar  period.  Over  the  period 1979-89 ,  US firms  in  the  manufacturing  sector  were  able  to  raise labour productivity an average of 3 6 . per cent per annum (compared to 2 9 . per cent per  annum  between 1948 and 1973 )  and total  factor productivity  an average  of 2 9 . per  cent  per  annum  (compared  to 2 1 . per  cent  per annum between 1948 and 1973 ). This has not prevented their taking advantage of  relatively  high  levels  of  unemployment  and  a  declining number of decent-paying jobs,  so  as  to  secure  the reduction of  hourly real wages by about 15 per cent between 1973 and the present. 130 The point  is  that  the  dichotomy  between  'flexible  liberal'  and  team/ cooperative  as  distinct  and  competing  socio-technical  forms  is,  to  a great  degree,  a  false  one.  The  sort  of  cooperation  and  teamwork needed successfully to implement new technologies today can, at least to an important extent, be secured through the incentives provided by workers' belief that they must make their firms competitive in order to keep them in business (or they will lose their jobs), as well as the sanctions of a loose and deteriorating labour market.

The Regulationists may overestimate the degree to which capital must

enter  into  genuinely  cooperative  arrangements  with  labour  in  part because  they  perhaps  overrate  the  degree  to  which  the  new,  teamcentered,  Japanese-style  production  techniques  actually  raise  skills and thereby bring about increased dependence of employers on workers  in  the  productive  process.  Whatever  else  it  offers,  team  or  'lean' production does little or nothing to increase the level of workers' skill, let  alone  make  them  into  craftspeople.  Indeed,  far  from  the  antiTaylorian  revolution  that  Lipietz  envisions,  the  foundation  for  the productivity  gains  secured  on  the  shop  floor  through  team  or  lean production  is  hyperTaylorization-the  super-deskilling  of  jobs  by means  of  their  breakdown  into  their  simplest  possible  components (fittingly  called  'details'  by  the  Japanese).  This  is  achieved  through what has been illuminatingly termed 'management by stress', in which the  goal  is  to  remove,  to  the  greatest  extent  possible,  not  only  all 'indirect'  and  'specialist'  labour  coming  from  off  the  line  (maintenance, repair, housekeeping, quality checking, and the like), as well as all excess materials at work stations, but also to make sure all workers are labouring throughout the entire time the work is at their station. Initially,  teams  of  managers  and  group  leaders  actually  work  on  each job and provide, from above, a highly detailed specification of its content,  the  details  composing  it.  The  workers  themselves  then  carry through their tasks under conditions in which, to the greatest extent possible, all 'safety nets' in the form of surplus materials and adjunct workers have been removed. Workers and their teams are not allowed to  let  defects  pass,  to  be  dealt  with  at  the  end  of  the  line,  but  are required  to  take  responsibility  for  quality  control  by  fixing  each  one at the time it is discovered and, in particular, by tracing the problem back to its source. In this situation, workers, as well as managers, are able to discover which tasks need more (or less) time and which jobs need to be redesigned, so that the labour force can be allocated in the most efficient possible manner. 131

It  is  because  workers  themselves  in  this  way  make  an  independent contribution  to  the  rationalization  of  work  that  they  can  rightly  be said to be using their talents for increasing productivity. It is because jobs  have  been  so  highly  simplified  that  workers  can  be  asked  to master all, or almost all, of the jobs done by the members of the team. This does make for greater flexibility and higher quality, as well as for the 'filling of the pores' of the working day, bringing about increased output both by raising efficiency and intensifying effort per unit time. But,  the  so-called  polyvalence  that  is  achieved  does  not  bring  much increase  of  workers'  skill,  except  in  a  highly  attenuated  sense  of  the

term. Nor do workers secure increased control: as time goes on, their jobs are ever more fully defined from above to the smallest detail by engineers  and  managers,  and  they  retain  the  initiative  primarily  in helping the company further identify slack and waste in the system. At the  same  time,  precisely  because  team  or  lean  production  does  make for  the  hyper-simplification  of  tasks,  it  is  no  way  instantiates  an ostensible choice of technique embodying higher skill (human capital) but  lower  fixed  capital,  as  Lipietz  suggests.  On  the  contrary,  as  has been very well evidenced, the implementation of 'team' or 'lean' production,  like  analogous  processes  of  breakup  and  simplification  of tasks historically,  provides highly favourable conditions for the introduction  of  the  highest  levels  of  automation  and  new  technology.  It should not be surprising that, given the recent economy-wide stagnation,  to  the  extent  that  this  has  issued  in  increased  productivity,  the outcome  has  been  a  massive  reduction  in  jobs  and  thus  even  greater insecurity for US automobile workers. 132

In  this  situation  of  ongoing  economic  crisis,  for  workers  further  to involve themselves in 'the team concept' is merely to tie their fortunes ever more closely to 'their own' firms, to set themselves ever more directly against their fellow workers across the industry, and to undermine what is left of their collective union power. If the crisis deepens, no amount of goodwill on the part of their employers will save their jobs. And to the extent they have 'involved' themselves with their own companies, to that extent they will destroy their own ability to defend their condition.
