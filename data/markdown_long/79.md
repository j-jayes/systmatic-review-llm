#### INTRODUCTION

In the eighteenth century there was no Machinery Question. The
machine was then simply a material contrivance which demonstrated
the culmination and success of the division of labour. It was but one
of the many novel indications of industry in a largely rural landscape.
The technical innovation of the eighteenth century certainly evoked
a sense of excitement among contemporaries, and contributed to their
belief in economic progress. The intellectuals of the Enlightenment
welcomed it as an indicator of economic expansion which they believed
would contribute to the general 'improvement' of society. But in.the
early nineteenth century this prospect of a harmonious integration of
economic and social improvement was thrown into question. The face
of industrialisation now appeared concentrated in the machine. It
was the machine which seemed to be responsible for the disharmony
of rapidly expanding cotton towns, unprecedented population growth
and the economic crisis of the post-Napoleonic years. The eighteenth-
century vision of improvement had become the machinery question
of the early nineteenth century.
For contemporaries the Industrial Revolution meant steam power
and rapid mechanisation in the cotton textile industry. Yet in reality
such mechanisation directly affected only a small number of industries
and regions, and even in these its permanence might be questioned.
For rapid technical change was not the universal experience of the
Industrial Revolution; elsewhere it appeared rather as an expansion
on the basis of traditionally organised trades and manual labour. But
if the economy of early- to mid-nineteenth-century Britain continued


-----

to display many traditional features, the discontinuity with the
eighteenth century was none the less fundamental. The traditional
crafts and manual labour might continue, but they now did so within
the circuit of industrial capital. The economic cycle of a cotton industry
rapidly becoming mechanised - waves of industrial credit creation
culminating in periodic financial panics and overcapacity in the
Lancashire factories - rippled outwards to affect the old artisan trades.
The trades, too, were now pursued by the rationalisation of production
and the standardisation of the product. An ever expanding supply of
labour made its contribution, making possible the intensification of the
division of labour and the reduction of skill. But already manifest, and
dwarfing in potential significance these other forms which technical
change in an industry might take, was the ultimate, the most exciting
and the most threatening development of all - the replacement of man
by machine.
The economic uncertainty of the period meant that mechanisation
presented a distinctly ambiguous face to contemporaries. It was far
from clear whether it was a portent of inevitable economic revolution,
or but one course of development among several, which might be
adopted or rejected, in whole or in part, depending on the nation's
goals and priorities. Its consequences were equally hard to determine.
Would it bring wealth only to those who owned it, or to society as a
whole ? Would it make work or create unemployment ? Would it unite
society or foment class conflict? Such uncertainties about both the
direction and the effects of mechanisation naturally yielded a wide
variety of responses. The machine was to evoke both eulogy and
resistance, and above all ambivalence.
The machinery question became in fact the hinge which connected
the new economic relations of production with the wider culture and
consciousness of the new bourgeoisie and working classes. With perhaps
greater clarity than any other contemporary issue the machinery
question defined the lines of division between these classes. Among
almost all the working classes, many of the middle classes and many
landowners the reception of the machine was decidedly equivocal.
Faced with their resistance, however, the industrial bourgeoisie and
their associates adopted an attitude of increasingly aggressive deter-
minism and optimism. For them it became axiomatic that mechanical
change was natural and evolutionary, the very motor of progress itself.
At the centre of this struggle over the interpretation of the future
effects of the new technology was political economy. The period of


-----

intense debate on the machinery issue coincided with the making of
this new discipline. Both internal intellectual and external social
developments contributed to establishing its status. Internally, a unique
object of inquiry and a specific intellectual framework of analysis were
established. At the centre of this inquiry was the phenomenon of
technical change, and it was one of the first concerns of economic
analysis to provide an adequate theoretical explanation of this.
Simultaneously, machinery helped to establish the social standing of
the discipline. In defence of the machine, middle-class popularisers
and politicians elevated the ideas and mode of analysis of political
economy into unquestioned doctrine, and economic theorists came to
be closely associated with the formulation of economic policy. The
intellectual and social prestige of political economy was only reinforced
when those opposed to machinery began also to criticise the theory
which defended it: working-class radicals and even Tories were not
slow to discover that the best critical tools were provided by political
economy itself.
It was thus that the great debate over machinery simultaneously
shaped the features of political economy while both stood at the centre
of the stage of social, political and intellectual conflict in the early
nineteenth century. Yet the significance of this relation between the
machinery question and the making of political economy in the upheaval
of the period has passed almost unnoticed by historians. The reason for
this remarkable indifference lies, I believe, in the previous splintering
of many fields of history - the history of economic thought, the history
of science and social science, the history of social and economic policy,
economic history, and political and social history.
Political and social historians, for their part, have repeatedly re-
turned to the 'condition of England' debate. But their attention has
been concentrated either on the standard of living, wages and prices,
or on the impact of industrialisation on working-class culture and
political consciousness. They have only begun to explore in detail the
impact of rapid mechanisation on the actual organisation of production,
the definition of skill and the structure of employment and unemploy-
ment, let alone the intense contemporary debate over the issue. Still
less have they investigated the significance of political economy in either
its popularised classical form or its radical alternatives. The ascendancy
and success of Ricardian economics have not been explained, nor do we
yet have a satisfactory explanation of the way in which political
economy was woven into the rising careers of William Huskisson,


-----

Joseph Hume and Francis Place. We have still to learn the extent to
which political economy formed a dimension of middle-class provincial
culture, and its relationship to the contemporary scientific movement.
Social and political historians have also, for the most part, consigned
the consideration of political economy to a separate domain : the history
of political economy has been left to economists and specialist historians
of economic thought. These specialists have indeed produced a major
literature, but they have cut themselves off from and made little impact
on the mainstream of economic, political and social history. Most
histories of economic thought have, in fact, been written within an
identifiable and deliberately restrictive framework. It was Joseph
Schumpeter's History of Economic Analysis which did most to define
the limits of the specialist histories of political economy. Although he
conceded that economic thought must ultimately be ideological,
Schumpeter believed that economic analysis proper could be treated
as independent and objective. He regarded it as a hard core of formal
techniques and instruments governed by supra-historical standards and
rules. For this economic analysis he accordingly proclaimed a separate
history which would ascertain the course of its scientific progress.[1] On
the basis of this view of the history of economic thought Schumpeter
himself proceeded through his book to apportion praise and blame to
each economic thinker he came to according to how well they measured
up to his own (heterodox) opinions. Schumpeter's approach was to be
adopted by the great majority of writers on the classical economists.
Mark Blaug's Economic Theory in Retrospect, D. P. O'Brien's The
_Classical Economists, and Marian Bowley's Studies in the History of_
_Economic Theory before i8jo[2] were representative of the received_
methods. Only a few have resisted the trend. In 1946, Hla Myint
warned against 'theoretical anthropomorphism', and advocated an
approach to the classical economists in the 'context of their own intel-
lectual climate'.[8] But his was a lone voice.
An historical approach was, to be sure, also advocated by a number
of Marxist and Sraffian economists claiming to use the method of

historical materialism. But their practice was actually little different
from that of their neo-classical opponents. They interpreted their claim
as historical, to mean the search for the origins of Marxism and latterly
for the origins of the Sraffian interpretation of Marx. Maurice Dobb
expressed the perspective succinctly in his Theories of Value and
_Distribution since Adam Smith'. 'Apart from its special corollaries,_
what is particularly striking . . . about the Sraffa-system viewed as a
whole is its rehabilitation of the Ricardo-Marx approach to problems
of value and distribution from the side of production.'[4] Otherwise,
the method of historical materialism appeared to involve little more
than the simple ascription of bourgeois class interests and motivation
to the concepts and theories of classical economics, examples of which
were often taken directly from Marx's own denunciations of classical
political economy.
The practical similarities in the methodology of both neo-classical
and neo-Marxist approaches ended, in fact, in a common pessimistic
interpretation of Ricardo and the classical economists. Schumpeter and
Blaug from the neo-classical standpoint and Pasinetti from the Sraffian
presented the classicals as dominated by Malthusian fears of over-
population, Ricardian predictions of the advent of the stationary state,
and an apparent indifference to the impact of technological change.[5]

These conventional conclusions are still to be found in Keith Tribe's
_Land, Labour and Economic Discourse, despite a considerable effort_
to elaborate a more substantial alternative to the Schumpeterian frame-
work.[6] Tribe's avowed approach is structural - a study not of the text
and the author, but of the discourse. Following broadly the methods
of the French structuralist philosophers and historians of ideas,
Althusser and Foucault, Tribe seeks to provide an anatomy of economic
argument from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. What this
method appears to involve is abandoning the attempt to read texts as
self-contained entities and to investigate the intentions of specific
authors in favour of establishing a general, impersonal pattern of

concepts and arguments. By these means Tribe would escape both from
teleological interpretations of the evolution of ideas and from crude
ascriptions of ideology. Nevertheless, the interpretation of Ricardo in
particular and the developments of early nineteenth-century political
economy in general does not substantially differ from the received
views of neo-classicals and Sraffians.
My book is also an attempt to escape the presentation of historical
arguments as anticipations of more recent theories. However, I believe
that, while it is important to establish the internal structure of ideas,
this alone is not sufficient for a history of political economy. In addition,
the context provided by evidence of authors' intentions, by the social
concerns and connections of the period, and by contemporary issues of
economic policy, must also be considered in an historical approach to
the classical economists. The contextual framework can contribute as
much as the intellectual structure of the theory to an understanding
of the making of political economy as a discipline.
This book is such an attempt to integrate economic thought into
economic and social change. In doing so I have reached some different
conclusions on the internal evolution of political economy, and have
made some new connections between social and intellectual develop-
ments. I have been led to emphasise a profound interest in technical
change pervading political economy in the early nineteenth century,
an interest associated with a decidedly optimistic view of future
economic growth. There was, furthermore, a noticeable shift of
emphasis in these theories of technical change from concern with the
division of labour and labour productivity to fixed capital formation,
a shift which may be connected directly with new levels of social
conflict from the early 1830s and indirectly with changes in real
economic structure. This external context for theories of technical
change can be established at a variety of levels from the mundane,
practical world of factory organisation and control, through the popular
cultural institutions of the Mechanics Institutes and the scientific and
statistical societies, up to the political worlds of radicals, Tories and
social reformers. At the same time, it can be seen that machinery was a
major problem of economic policy, drawing the political economists
into the political arena. Over the period, in fact, a marked improve-
ment in their political standing can be seen: where Ricardo was but
a respected independent commentator, Nassau Senior was a fully-
fledged government expert. I conclude that the machinery question
was never resolved, but that in the 1840s it lay at the heart of an


-----

irreconciliable schism in economics and politics. On the one hand, J. S.
Mill's sceptical restatement of Ricardianism opened up a newly
questioning and progressive path for liberalism, but failed to resolve
now well-established differences among economists. On the other,
radical and working-class resistance to industrialisation found an
unprecedented revolutionary expression in Engels's Condition of the
_Working Class in England which analysed the capitalist basis of recent_
technical change, and predicted its eventual destruction at the hands
of the class conflict it generated.
My emphasis on the centrality of machinery and industrialisation
to the making of political economy is not in itself original. It does no
more than recall the judgements of the first histories of economic
thought. Perhaps the earliest of these was J. R. McCulloch's Discourse
_on the Rise, Progress, Peculiar Objects and Importance of Political_
_Economy, published in 1824.[7] There, McCulloch insisted that the_
emergence of political economy must be explained in material terms.
McCulloch himself produced only the very general argument that the
science could only arise in a commercial, capitalist society. But his
injunction was followed by Travers Twiss, whose View of the Progress
_of Political Economy in Europe of 1847 developed an interpretation_
tied explicitly to the rise of industrial capitalism. According to Twiss,

The great motive power which the genius of Watt had first
disciplined ... was applied, about the year 1785 in furtherance
of the discoveries of Arkwright, and the combination of the
steam engine with the spinning frame, [not only] changed an
aspect of production [but also] gave rise to a new class of
problems, bearing upon the distribution of the produce.

Twiss proceeded to distinguish Adam Smith's economics from that of
the later classicals by reference to industrialisation. In Smith's period,
'the operation of industry, properly so called in distinction from labour,
had not assumed that importance which entitled [it] to a special
analysis'.[8]

Twiss drew material for his history from an earlier French work,
Jerome Blanqui's Political Economy in Europe, first published in 1837.
Blanqui explicitly argued that the English classicals had given political

economy a 'physiognomy and tendency exclusively industrial'. He
believed that this had led them to consider manufactures and machines
as 'too separate from the welfare of the labourers'; with the consequence
that they 'manifested an insensibility to the sufferings of the working
classes'.[9]

This book is not conceived as a simple return to these early histories
of political economy, for they were often highly simplified or sectarian.
However, it does aspire to follow a similar course to those early
historians in connecting the origins of the discipline to a specific eco-
nomic context. My starting point like theirs was the coincidence of
industrialisation with the beginnings of political economy. But I have
tried to go further in offering an analysis of the many different levels -
political, social, intellectual - at which political economy was made and
articulated. For this is the only way, I believe, that we can hope to arrive
at some understanding of the complex connections between context
and theory, and thus write neither a hagiography nor a teleology, but
a history of political economy. This book will prove, I hope, a step in
that direction.

###### PART ONE THE MACHINERY QUESTION

##### The age of machinery

In the popular mind the Industrial Revolution has always been asso-
ciated with the steam engine and the cotton mill. For a long time
this was also the characteristic view of the economic historian:
traditionally, the story of the Industrial Revolution was written as the
triumph of new techniques, and the inevitable march of invention.
In recent years economic historians have indeed attempted to displace
this technological bias in their predecessors, offering broader accounts
of the economics of 'take-off' or balanced growth, of capital accumu-
lation or gains in labour productivity. Important though these new
interpretations are, however, they can never entirely supplant the
popular, traditional conception of the Industrial Revolution. For the
traditional has the justification of being the contemporary view: to
those who lived through it, the Industrial Revolution was not take-off,
but, more equivocally, the machinery question.
The machine was not an impersonal achievement to those living
through the Industrial Revolution; it was an issue. The machinery
question in early nineteenth-century Britain was the question of the
sources of technical progress and the impact of the introduction of the
new technology of the period on the total economy and society. The
question was central to everyday relations between master and work-
man, but it was also of major theoretical and ideological interest. The
very technology at the basis of economy and society was a platform of
challenge and struggle.
The machinery question was, furthermore, an issue which stimulated
analysis in political economy during the key years of the formation of


-----

this new intellectual discipline. Political economists took up the
theoretical debate on the introduction, diffusion and social impact of
the radically new techniques of production associated with the era.
Recognising that the machine formed the basis for an unprecedented
economic transformation, political economists created new concepts
and made the growth potential and technological advances of the
British economy the new focus of their analysis. Breaking from the
wider political and social concerns of their forebears, political econo-
mists of the early nineteenth century forged a new and distinct science
of political economy. It was economic growth and its now limitless
prospects created by technological advance which became the new
centre, not just of the analysis of the economy, but of the analysis of
politics and society as well. The economy was no longer conceived as
subordinate to broader social and political ideals. It now played a
distinct and a dominant role. The analysis of the machinery question
was formative in the creation of a political economy which became
the 'natural science' of economy and society in the second quarter of
the nineteenth century.
The machine awakened the interest of early political economists,
not just for the departure it evidently meant for the significance and
speed of economic expansion, but for the pervasiveness of its social
impact. For, as a subject which evoked an equivocal response, the
machine was debated at length in all sectors of society. It provoked the
village cleric as much as it did the cosmopolitan intellectual; it con-
cerned the politician as much as the workman and employer; the social
reformer as much as scientist and inventor. These groups contended
over the costs and benefits of the new technology. They hailed the
release it provided from limits to growth, but disagreed over the impact
it would have on wages, employment, and skill. They speculated on,
and then either welcomed or dreaded, the changes the machine would
bring to social relations. The origins and the ownership of machinery
even came up for question. There was excitement and fear at this
unknown force which swept relentlessly onward, casting the old society
in its wake.
The great range of contemporary writing on economic, social and
intellectual aspects of the rapid industrialisation of early nineteenth-
century Britain made the machinery question a national controversy.
It claimed the status of an intellectual debate. It was formulated as a
policy question and was an important element in the strategic thinking
among the various social and political interest groups of the period.


-----

Actual occurrences of anti-machinery activity or of eulogies to the new
technology are only meaningful in the broader context. They were part
of a wider issue in the early nineteenth century, unlike the individual
and specific reactions characteristic of the years both before and after
the period.
The machinery question was unique, for the British experience of
industrialisation was the first. Never again and in no other country's
industrial revolution would there be quite the same sense of struggle,
apprehension, excitement and unpredictability. Though technology
would continue to be an issue in later phases of Britain's industrial-
isation, the experience of the early years of the nineteenth century
would always stand as an example, if not as a model. For some who
contemplated the prospects of wealth and power the machine might
bring, the experience of technical change was a novelty and an excite-
ment. But alongside an emergent industrial landscape large sectors of
the economy remained traditional. And, to many, the implications
of the new machines were not at all welcome. The first generation of
factory labour and cast-off artisans were among those who regarded
the new machinery as unnatural. In the uncertainty of the times it still
seemed possible to halt the process of rapid technical change.
Depression scarred the economy for well over a decade after the
Napoleonic Wars. Against this dispiriting background, the machine
appeared to some to be a simple and obvious symbol of progress.
Inculcating its message wordlessly, its meaning was inherent in its
physical attributes. As John Stuart Mill expressed it, 'The more visible
fruits of scientific progress . . . the mechanical improvements, the steam
engine, the railroads, carry the feeling of admiration for the modern,
and disrespect for ancient times, down even to the wholly uneducated
classes.'[1] But this reaction to the machine was by no means typical, for
the response to reconstruction after long years of war was an indecisive
one. It was difficult to predict the outcome of such artificial times, and
the ultimate direction of the fragile society of these years was a great
unknown. The machine was a symbol of progress, but it could also
evoke feelings of powerlessness and fear. Even Charles Babbage recalled
such feelings when he visited an iron works with a hundred horsepower
engine: 'The intensity of that fire was peculiarly impressive. It
recalled the past, disturbed the present, and suggested the future . . .

candour obliges me to admit that my speculations on the future were
not entirely devoid of anxiety.'[2]

And equally a disconsolate radical could comment, 'One rarely finds
anyone who ventures to deal frankly with the problem of machinery
. . . it appears to infuse a certain fear. Everybody sees that machinery
is producing the greatest of all revolutions between classes, but somehow
nobody dares to interfere.[53] The machine might overturn the old
society, but some dreaded the prospects of clanking steam engines, 'the
Scottish Brass-smith's IDEA',[4] as Thomas Carlyle characterised it.

The huge demon of Mechanism smokes and thunders, panting
at his great task, in all sections of English land; changing his
_shape like a very Proteus; and infallibly at every change of_
shape, oversetting whole multitudes of workmen, as if with the
waving of his shadow from afar, hurling them asunder, this
way and that, in their crowded march and curse of work or
traffic.[5]

The cultural critique of the machine is indeed best expressed by
Carlyle, who dubbed this period as the 'Age of Machinery'. He con-
nected the machine as technical fact with the machine as metaphor,
representing the overvaluation of all aspects of life that were calculable
and open to manipulation. The machine was material and incorporeal.
With its onset 'the living artisan' was replaced by an 'inanimate one'.
The 'shuttle dropped from the fingers of the weaver and fell into iron
fingers that ply it faster'.[6] But the 'machine of society'[7] was also 'despair
and death of spirit', 'a huge, dead, immeasurable steam engine, rolling
on, in its dead indifference'.[8] The cultural critics blamed the machine
for bringing to England's new industrial towns a bleak, quantitative,
utilitarian society. Charles Dickens, for example, portrayed life in a
town of machinery as dictated by the piston of a steam engine which
worked monotonously up and down, 'like the head of an elephant in a

state of melancholy madness'.[9] It was a society where everything was
quantified, mechanised, calculated as 'so many hundred hands in this
Mill; so many hundred horse steampower' - everything except the soul
of man.[10]

Carlyle's criticisms of the cultural implications of the machine also
extended to the social dislocation and economic precedents created
by the new technology. The 'Inventive Genius of England' would have
to create more than the 'whirr of bobbins and billy-rollers'. It would
have to find the means for a fairer distribution of the products of
machinery. The introduction of steam power 'into the social system'
was productive, not just of greater total wealth, but of greater distance
between the rich and the poor, and 'would be a question for political
economists and a much more complex and important one than they
have yet engaged with'.
This emphasis on the social disruption caused by the machine was
to be the main factor making the machinery question an economic
issue of widespread public concern. Carlyle's opinion that disparities in
wealth had been revealed and even widened by mechanisation and
industrialisation was echoed in the writings of playwrights and novelists
throughout the first half of the nineteenth century. They epitomised
the social disruption caused by the machine in their dramatic depiction
of resistance to machinery among the poor. John Walker, an early
nineteenth-century London playwright, was one of the first to do this.
His play, The Factory Lad, produced at the Surrey in 1832, centred
on an incident of industrial strife and machine breaking which had
ensued on the decision of a factory owner to introduce new machinery
and to make many of his workers redundant.[11] Disraeli's working
people in Sybil blamed their troubles on machinery: 'As for rights of
labour,' said Harriet, 'the people goes for nothing with this machinery
. . . Fancy preferring a piece of iron or wood to your own flesh and
blood. And they call that Christian like.'[12] Disraeli identified machine
breaking among the poor, not with mindless mob violence, but with
physical force Chartism. Reading about an attack on a local mill,
Field, the character chosen to represent the physical force Chartist,
suggests, 'perhaps we may contrive to gain admission, and then we can

sack the whole affair, and let the people burn the machinery. It will
be a great moral lesson.[513]

Elizabeth Gaskell, George Eliot and Charlotte Bronte all portrayed
the poor and the working people of their novels as anti-machinery
advocates, though for different reasons. Gaskell and Eliot depicted a
stereotyped resistance to machinery among the poor. In GaskelPs Mary
_Barton, John Barton, elected Chartist delegate to London, garnered_
the grievances of his poor neighbours: 'Bless thee, lad, do ask 'un to
make tha' masters break th' machines. There's never been good times
sin' spinning jennies came up . . . "Machines is the ruin of poor folk"
chimed in several voices.'[14] Eliot had Brooke, her reforming landlord,
speak to the people: 'I've gone a good deal into public questions -
machinery, now, and machine breaking - you're many of you concerned
with machinery, and I've been going into that lately. It won't do, you
know, breaking machines.'[15]

Bronte, in contrast, went deeper, and depicted the machine as an
alien force. It was, like the millowner Moore, foreign to the region:
'Not being a native, nor for any length of time a resident of this
neighbourhood, he did not sufficiently care when the new invention
threw the old workpeople out of employment.'[16] And the 'starving poor
of Yorkshire' released their pent-up frustrations: 'Misery generates
hate : these sufferers hated the machines which they believed took their
bread from them: they hated the buildings which contained those
machines; they hated the manufacturers who owned those buildings.'[17]

Whereas Bronte sympathised with her poor, Gaskell ignored their
attitudes as the product of ignorance. Gaskell, therefore, introduced
into her story the character Job Leigh, a self-educated worker-
intellectual with more 'progressive' opinions: 'It's true it was a sore
time for handloom weavers when power looms came in: these new
fangled things make a man's life like a lottery; and yet I'll never mis-
doubt that power looms, and railways, and all such like inventions, are
the gifts of God. I have lived long enough, too, to see that it is part of
his plan to send suffering to bring out a higher good.'[18]

The novelist and later their literary critics, such as Raymond
Williams, knew that the issue was important to the early Victorian

society they sought to probe. Raymond Williams has described this
centrality of technology for the contemporary mind : 'Again and again,
even by the critics of society, the excitement of this extraordinary
release of man's powers was acknowledged and shared. The society
could not have been acceptable to anybody without that. "These are
our poems," Carlyle said in 1842, looking at one of the new locomotives,
and this element, now so easily overlooked, is central to the whole
culture.'[19] But historians have thus far told us little about the machinery
question as an integrated intellectual, political and social issue. Dis-
putes over the impact of the machine have been mentioned by historians
only obliquely as an aspect of the 'condition of England' question.
Many historians have dealt with merely the cultural dimensions of the
debate, stopping short at any serious discussion of economic, social
and political aspects of the machine. We know a great deal, therefore,
about the struggle between the mechanistic Benthamite philosophy and
the romantic reaction in the formation of the general culture. The
machine has also figured in histories of working-class revolt. Machine
breaking among the Luddites, the agricultural labourers 'led by'
Captain Swing, and the weavers has fascinated social historians inter-
ested in the origins of the British labour movement, in the collective
violence of the crowd, and in the politically conscious activity of the
poor. But machine breaking has been written of mainly in terms of
generalisation about these areas of interest. Social historians have shown
less interest in making connections between such resistance to the
machine and the political and intellectual disputes over technological
improvement taking place in the wider society. They have been
reluctant to regard individual occurrences of resistance to the machine
as a part of a more general phenomenon — a national debate on the
machinery question.
The political positions adopted in this period were stamped with
economic choices, and a major issue on which a distinctive stand was
necessary to each social group was the debate on industrialisation.
Perspectives on the new technology infused both Tory-landed ideas
about the new society and radical working-class alternatives. Middle-
class ideologues grasped at the progressive implications of the machine
in their attempt to loose the bondage of landed and pre-industrial
attitudes. But they had also to face the challenge created by conservative
and working-class alternatives to an industrial capitalist society.

Conservative or Tory opinion was distinguished by protest against
the very existence of industrial society, and at the foundation of this
there was a deep-seated prejudice against the machine. The Tory
choice was not simply one of rural versus urban life; its dilemma was
not just the fate of the agricultural sector in the face of industry. For
methods and relations of production on the land were changing as
fundamentally as were those in industry. The image of the threshing
machine in Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles as 'the red tyrant that
the women had come to serve . . . which . . . kept up a despotic demand
on the endurance of their muscles and nerves' is aptly perceived by
Raymond Williams as a part of a deeper change going beyond the
abstraction of industry against rural life.[20] Williams argues that the
vision of the country must include the 'action of the real threshing
machine. It stands in that field and works those hours because it has
been hired, not by industrialism, but by a farmer.'[21] The issue of in-
dustry and the land was just one part of a more general discussion of
the whole process of industrialisation.
However, Toryism was not by any means a single set of doctrines.
The novelty of industrial society was, in fact, one of the factors which
contributed to a split in the early nineteenth-century Tory party,
between the progressive liberal Toryism of Lord Liverpool's admini-
stration from 1815 to 1830 and the Tory country party. The liberal
Tories did not welcome the machine, but they did believe it was here
to stay. Country Toryism, on the other hand, was a continued protest
against the suppression of a rural England it knew by an industrialised
England it knew not.[22]

The working class challenged the beneficence of the machine first
by its own distress then by its relentless protest. This protest did not
just flare up in sporadic occurrences of Luddism or Swing Riots. Such
incidents only highlighted a day by day resistance to the machine evi-
dent in many workplace settings. Workers criticised the rapid and
unplanned introduction of new techniques in situations where the
immediate result would be technological unemployment. But they also
went beyond this to challenge the uses and property relations of
technology. They demanded an equitable distribution of the gains
from technical progress. Rather than raising the profits of the few,

the machine, they argued, might lighten the labour and increase the
leisure of the many. They also demanded greater control over the
direction of technological change. Mechanisation was unnecessary in
industries where there was an abundance of labour, for it only further
dragged down wages and led to greater overcrowding of labour markets
in other industries. The machine and what went with it, the technical
division of labour, should not be allowed to degrade and alienate
labour. Rather it should allow man the possibility of developing his
potentials in many fields. Technological progress should also be directed
to changing the role of women in society, dispensing with the heavy
manual labour and the household chores which prevented many
women from claiming an equal position with men.
But, like the Tories, working-class leaders took up many contradictory
positions on the machinery issue. Some embraced the machine as
fundamental to their Utopian dreams, but many more saw it as a cause
of economic distress. More immediate than the Utopian dreaming was
the bitter experience of technological unemployment, long hours of
alienated factory labour, and the smoking blight of rapidly expanding
industrial towns.
Middle-class economic and political perspectives actively eulogised
the progress of science and technology. But, challenged on both sides
by Tory and radical working-class opinion, the middle class had to find
an explanation for the economic and social impact of the machine.
Expressions of wonder at the technical perfection of the machine were
not adequate. It was thus that the middle class took to itself a 'scientific'
theory, political economy. This theory was expected to provide answers
by employers, politicians, and middle-class ideologists. It was no mere
coincidence that industrialisation and the emergence of political
economy occurred at virtually the same time. Political economy became
a distinct discipline from the 1790s, breaking free from the place
allotted it by previous writers, including Adam Smith, as a branch of
legislation or statesmanship. The Industrial Revolution in cotton and
iron concurred with this intellectual break. Since the very inception of
political economy as an intellectual discipline, the conscious reflection
on the processes of economic development could not be separated from
the emerging class forces and social interests at stake in the changes.
Political economy was expected to explain the effects of the new
industrialism. It was to these intellectuals that the middle class looked
**for the affirmation of their attitudes. It was these expositors of the new**
science of wealth who provided the authority and guidance needed by


-----

the new industrial elites. Tory and radical leaders came to identify the
mechanical age or the new industrialism with the doctrine of political
economy and the interests of the middle class. The machinery question,
therefore, became entwined with political economy. In the process,
the terms of debate on the machinery issue were set by political economy.
But the analysis offered by political economy was also a complicated
one. Political economy, though regarded by many as an arm of middle-
class opinion, escaped the boundaries of mere opinion. For, as an
intellectual discipline, it was expected to go beyond the attempts of
factions and social groups to stabilise the transitory order in some way
best suited to their own special interests. The projections made by
individuals and political economists on the economy, and their opinions
on the social impact of mechanisation, ranged widely. Where they
attempted to offer a fundamentally optimistic prospect, they were also
forced to admit some naggingly obvious disadvantages. This, in turn,
reflected the ambivalences of middle-class opinion. The disruptions
caused by mechanisation brought in train a legacy of fear, and led to
the expression of doubts coupled with a polemical optimism. Such an
optimism was, however, also based partly on ignorance. This is clearly
demonstrated in the general incomprehension of poverty during the
period, in the response to critiques of machinery, and in the cult of
comparative growth studies of England, Europe, and America. It is
notable too that by the 1830s this optimism was joining a new
Victorian middle-class conscience for the amelioration of poverty.
Optimism and conscience complemented each other in those projects
characteristic of the early Victorian middle classes: philanthropy, urban
reform, education and moral virtue.
This book will chart the issues which made machinery a question
of national significance. As a preliminary, it will describe the actual
diffusion of the machine in the early nineteenth-century economy. But
its purpose is to go beyond this, to demonstrate that the political and
intellectual circumstances culminating in the emergence of political
economy as a new discipline were also the ones which made the
machinery question such a vital issue to contemporaries. The book
will describe the range of opinions and many ambivalences in the
positions of Tory, working-class and middle-class groups. It will demon-
strate just how the machinery question became an issue around which
the early discipline of political economy was formulated. It will also
show just how central the machinery question was to the Tory and
working-class critiques of political economy. It will relate the develop-


-----

ment of this political economy to the immediate social and political
context of the machinery issue in popular scientific and social reform
movements, and in policy debates in Parliament over the machine.
Finally it will demonstrate the intellectual legacy of the machinery
question in nineteenth-century Britain in the work of two contrasting
and idiosyncratic, but subsequently highly influential, theorists, John
Stuart Mill and Frederick Engels. Their works, the Principles of
_Political Economy, and The Condition of the Working Class in England,_
both first published in the 1840s, represent the summing up and the
reformulation of the machinery question in such a way as to create
two new and contrasted roads for political economy which were to
dominate the rest of the nineteenth century and beyond.
This book will maintain throughout that the machinery question
existed as a truly national issue of debate only in the early nineteenth
century. A special economic and social context and a particular
intellectual basis gave it a very distinctive historical character. The
challenge of the first experience of industrialisation and mechanisation,
and the sharply focussed controversy over the impact of mechani-
sation made this an issue that was unprecedented both in its scale and
in its social repercussions. A distinct intellectual context set the terms
for the manner in which the issue was debated, for discussion of the
introduction of the new technology was never very far from discussion
of the new political economy. The intellectual context of the machinery
question in the early nineteenth century was the development of the
new discipline of political economy.

##### The progress of the machine

The phenomenon of the machine was vividly apparent. It is the purpose
of this chapter to chart the spread of the machine in a variety of
important industries in early nineteenth-century Britain, as a knowledge
of the actual extent of mechanisation is a prerequisite to any critical
analysis of the ideas and assumptions of the time. Whether the period
between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the 1840s was one which
saw only the inception of an industrialised economic structure, whether
it was a period of flux, or whether it was a society already mechanised
on a wide scale, has important implications for the way in which con-
temporary attitudes are interpreted. On the one hand, ideas might
have been related to warnings and hopes, to possibilities for manipu-
lation and to the impossibilities of prediction. On the other hand,
such ideas could be interpreted as feelings of despair and regret for
lost opportunities of turning back, or at least of changing direction.
Even if the latter formulation is the more correct, it is still important to
ask in turn whether the apparently irrevocable process of industrial-
isation was marked by a mechanical revolution, or whether it took
other forms, and whether it was a rapid or a long-drawn-out process.
For some time it has been fashionable to see the Industrial Revo-
lution as a lengthy process reaching back to the early eighteenth
century and continuing into the mid nineteenth century. It has also
been fashionable to stress the labour-intensive bias of the Industrial
Revolution in Britain. The continued use of traditional methods and
hand techniques was caused, it is argued, by the abundance of British

labour. The assessment of British industrialisation by strict quantitative
estimates over the economy as a whole has yielded widely differing
suggestions of the amount of capital tied up in machinery in the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Phyllis Deane and W. A.
Cole calculated that machinery accounted for as little as 2^ per cent
of national capital in 1800 and 4 per cent in 1832, and this confirmed
the views of a generation of historians. These estimates have, however,
been challenged recently by C. H. Feinstein's new figures on capital
formation[1] which indicate, not only that capital formation overall
was much greater in this period than was previously imagined, but
that the amount of capital tied up in machinery was much closer to
5 per cent of domestic fixed capital in 1750 and 17 per cent in 1850.
We may not perhaps choose to accept aggregative valuations that give
rise to such wide differences on both basic data and on its implications.
But, even so, it must be admitted that the shocks of a rapid process of
mechanisation were there, albeit confined to particular sectors and
regions, and these pointed the way of future developments. It was
also evident that the economic and technical transformations of the
1820s and 1830s happened at a much faster pace than any previous
change.
The evidence of the 1851 census shows that agriculture and domestic
service were still by far the most important occupations, and that most
labour was engaged in industries of the old type, that is, the building
trades, tailoring, shoemaking, and unskilled labour of all sorts.[2] But
behind this still traditional face of the economy, there were many
striking advances.
The most obvious mark of the age of machinery was the steam
engine. G. N. von Tunzelman's recent book on the diffusion of the
steam engine[3] gathers together available contemporary figures on the
numbers of engines and the quantity of horsepower in the country in
the eighteenth and the early nineteenth centuries. Von Tunzelman
emphasises that evidence for the growth and diffusion of the steam
engine is scrappy and often inaccurate. We can glean at most an
approximate picture of the amount of steam power in early industrial
Britain. The imprecision of evidence also vitiates other estimates of

mechanisation, both over the economy as a whole and within specific
industries. The estimates gathered by von Tunzelman for the steam
engine can only be complemented by the guesses and approximations
made by several historians for a wide range of other industries.
Our picture of the progress of steam power by 1800 is an imprecise
one. Von Tunzelman guesses that there were probably somewhat fewer
than 490 Watt engines erected by 1800, with a total of 12,750 horse-
power. J. R. Harris estimated that the number of engines of all types
built at some stage in the eighteenth century was between 985 and
_1><5<$Q> with a total horsepower of 25,000 to 30,000. These figures,_
however, do not tell us how many of these steam engines had survived
and were actually at work in 1800.
Estimates for the nineteenth century are probably even less reliable.
Mulhall guessed there were 350,000 horsepower in stationary engines
in 1840 and 500,000 in 1850. His guess for the earlier part of the
century was certainly too high.
More precise nineteenth-century data exist for specific towns and
areas. Farey estimates that there were 112 steam engines in London
in 1805 with a total of 1,355 horsepower. By 1825 there were 290
steam engines for waterworks, small manufactures and steamboats
with 5,460 horsepower. Manchester had 32 engines with 430 horse-
power by 1800, and by 1825[ trie] town claimed 240 engines and 4,760
horsepower, or nearly one fifth the steam horsepower of the county.
Baines estimated that Bolton and the vicinity had 83 engines and 1,604
horsepower by 1825, and Ashworth counted 308 steam engines in the
whole district of Bolton in 1836-7, but the factory returns for the parish
of Bolton itself gave only 39 engines and 1,082 horsepower in July
1835. Leeds had 20 engines with a force of 270 horsepower in 1800,
and by 1825 F&[r]ey was able to count 120 engines with 2,330 horse-
power. R. J. Forbes claimed 60 engines for Birmingham with 1,000
horsepower in 1820, and only fifteen years later the Birmingham
Philosophical Society estimated 160 engines and 2,700 horsepower.
Glasgow had also made its mark by the early nineteenth century when
Cleland counted 45 steam engines with 720 horsepower in 1817, and
found a jump to 242 engines with 4,480 horsepower by 1825, but von
Tunzelman also cites the figure for the 1831 census - 250 engines with
4,400 horsepower - and finds Cleland's estimate for 1817 to be very
unlikely. Nor was this steam power concentrated in selected urban
centres, for country areas, particularly mining districts, had their fair
share of stationary engines. Even in 1800 the total horsepower in

**If the rapid diffusion of the steam engine meant that there was**

**textile industry certainly ranks as the most rapid and productive tech-**

**industry underwent a rapid and extraordinary expansion - the number**
**of spindles in cotton mills rose from 1.7 million in the 1780s to between**
**4 and 5 million in 1812 - and by the first decade of the nineteenth**
**century it was the most important British manufacturing industry. Mills**
**reached their peak sizes in the last decades of the eighteenth century**
**and during the Napoleonic Wars, and by 1811 there were over 100,000**
**operatives in factories. But the growth of the industry was even more**
**rapid in the decades after the Napoleonic Wars. The number of**
**spindles doubled in the fifteen years spanning the 1830s and 1840s.**
**There was even more striking change in the weaving branch: while in**
**1812 there were 2,400 powerlooms, but 200,000 handloom weavers,**
**by the late 1830s and early 1840s the number of handloom weavers**
**had fallen to about 50,000. By the 1820s, 1830s and 1840s the net out-**
**put of the industry was over five per cent that of total national output.[5]**

**In a town like Oldham the whole scale of the cotton industry was**
**completely transformed between the 1820s and 1830s. While handloom**

**now employed the majority of the labour force and three-quarters of**

even Rothesay in Bute had 94. In areas of Lancashire superintended
by J. Heathcote, James Bates, and Charles Trimmer there were 295
mills containing 62,663 power looms. In Cheshire there were 80 mills
with 22,915 looms, and in Yorkshire there were 96 mills with 7,809
looms in the areas surveyed. Other parts of Britain had also witnessed
the spread of the power loom, though to a much smaller degree. Factory
inspectors found 2,403 power looms in Derbyshire. In Devon, Essex,
Kent, Norfolk and Somerset there were 725 power looms dispersed
widely through silk, flax and woollen mills. In Warwickshire, Wor-
cestershire and Gloucestershire there were only 36 power looms in
districts canvassed by the inspectors.[8] In textiles, at least, large parts of
the country had countenanced the machine.
There was also very significant change taking place in processes of
other branches of industry, though less drastic than the change from
hand domestic work to the mechanised factory in cotton. The iron
industry rose to prominence and became highly mechanised at the end
of the eighteenth century and in the early years of the nineteenth
century. The major process innovation in iron-puddling had largely
superseded all other processes by the end of the Napoleonic Wars.
The mechanised iron works of the early nineteenth century contrasted
sharply with the old charcoal furnace. It employed steam engines as
a source of power for increasing the blast of air needed in coke furnaces,
and to drive the increasingly complex blowing mechanisms that began
to replace simple bellows in the 1760s and 1770s. In addition, the
industry boasted pressure regulators, mechanised feeding operations,
vertical and inclined hoists powered by steam, and mechanical aids for
transporting coal and ore from the mines. The refining process had
undergone an even more striking change by the early nineteenth
century. By this time a forge included two or three small 'refining'
furnaces, a dozen puddling furnaces, and several large shingling and
stamping hammers driven by a steam engine. Steam also powered the
rolling and slitting mills preparing iron for the market.[9] The industry
grew very slowly during the later part of the Napoleonic Wars and
experienced a heavy slump in the immediate postwar period, but by
the 1820s it was making new gains, and there were further substantial

advances after the introduction of the Neilson hot blast process between
1829[ a n] d 1833. This bolstered the Scottish iron industry and led to
a sharp increase in investment and output.[10] Other innovations of the
early nineteenth century were mainly of scale. The enlargement of
blast furnaces to raise the productivity of labour led to an increase in
the number of puddling furnaces. The production of large pieces of
metal led to innovations for lifting and transporting, including elevated
platforms, rails, overhead chain pulleys and cranes. Much later in the
period the innovation and diffusion of Nasmyth's steam hammer and
large boring machines gave both great strength and precise control.[11]

There is little way of measuring the changes of technique taking place
in the engineering industry. The last years of the eighteenth century
and first years of the nineteenth century saw the first emergence of
large-scale engineering works. The Soho, Maudslay, and Murray works
were renowned manifestations of the industrialisation process. The
major changes later took place in the range of hand tools which became
characterised by greater speed, accuracy, and conformity.[12] Tools
became heavier and more rigid, like Maudslay's all-metal lathe. They
became adaptable to a wider range of tasks with the addition of the
planing and shaping machines, and more powerful automatic and yet
precise with the introduction of Nasmyth's steam hammer.[18] Certainly
the industry had grown up rapidly, primarily to service the cotton
industry. McCulloch commented on the excellence of the machines
and steam engines made in Manchester and Glasgow, 'the preparation
and repair of which employs a great number of hands and a large
amount of capital'.[14]

The advances of the iron and engineering industries left their legacy
in the railroad, one of the greatest symbols of the 'Mechanical Age'.
Great fanfare accompanied the opening of the Manchester and Liver-
pool Railway in 1831, although there were then but 139.7 miles of rail
open. It was only in 1838 that the railway extended for more than 600
miles.[15]

The mechanical advances of these great industries were comple-
mented in turn by technical feats in lesser-known industries and on the
land. The remarkable advances of the papermaking and printing
trades astounded all who noticed them. Manchester was the principal
seat of the papermaking industry where,[ c]By the agency of a great deal
of complicated machinery so admirably contrived as to produce the
intended effect with unerring precision, and in the very best manner,
a process, which in the old system of papermaking occupied about
three weeks, is performed in as many minutes.[518] In the printing trade
the editor of The Times informed readers on 28 November 1814 that
they were reading for the first time a newspaper printed by steam-
impelled machinery. After this, innovations proceeded apace to in-
crease the production of copies per hour.[17]

Even the land saw the face of the machine. Though hand technolo-
gies continued to be far more significant than mechanical ones, landed
society also tasted the bitter-sweet fruits of mechanisation in the form
of the threshing machine. In 1800 these were confined to the North
of England. The southern counties were slower to adopt them, but
by 1819 there is evidence of their widespread use in East Kent, Wilt-
shire, Huntingdonshire and Berkshire.[18] It was of course this machine
which was one of Swing's major victims in some of the most extensive
machine-breaking episodes of the period.
If, however, mechanisation was rapid and widely diffused in the
cases of the steam engine, cotton spinning and weaving, iron making,
printing, and threshing, there were also many processes which remained
traditional both within these industries and in other sectors. For
example, though techniques in the cotton industry appeared to be
transformed suddenly and radically, parts of the industry's visage
seemed unchanging. Although during the last years of the eighteenth
century and the first years of the nineteenth century there had been
such important innovations as fireproof buildings, gas lighting, and
steam and warm^air heating, these had only been adopted by the same
few giant firms, which were uncharacteristic of the industry as a whole.[19]

The average primary process firm in Manchester as late as 1841
employed only 260 hands, and one quarter of all firms employed less

than ioo.[20] Even by 1851, in Great Britain as a whole, although three-
fifths of the 500,000 member workforce were in mills, more than two-
thirds of those mills employed less than 50. The average mill in the
country employed less than 200, and there were tens of thousands of
handloom weavers at work in rural cottages.[21]

The continuation of older methods of production was even more
marked in other branches of the textile trades, though by the mid
nineteenth century 2,750,000 (or 10 per cent of the total population)
and 21.4 per cent of the occupied population were in textiles and
clothing.[22] This indicates little about the impact of industrialisation
on the trades, for most of them remained traditional. The most advanced
of other textile groups before 1850 was the worsted industry. Whereas
in both cotton and worsted manufacture 71 per cent of spinning engines
were mechanised by 1839, only 36 per cent of those in the woollen indus-
try were. While there were 109,626 power looms in the cotton industry
in 1835, there were only 5,127 in woollen and worsted factories.[23] Even
as late as 1850 more than one third of the power available to woollen
manufacture came from water.[24] The silk and linen industries remained
largely unmechanised throughout the period. The silk industry
expanded in the second decade of the nineteenth century due to tech-
nical improvements in the throwing section, but did not lend itself
easily to mechanisation. At its peak in the 1860s only one third of its
employees worked in factories, and there were seven people employed
for every unit of steam horsepower available.[25]

This continuing juxtaposition of large and small firms, of mechanised
and hand processes, was repeated in other industries. In the engineering
industry, the division and subdivision of processes and the great changes
in tools did not alter the personal nature of the work. The millwright
still stood at the pinnacle of the hierarchy of industrial labour by
virtue of his flexibility and his role as a jack-of-all-trades.[26]

Fairbairn commented that despite sill the advances of the division of

labour it was still impossible to tell where a millwright enaed and an
engineer and machinist began: 'it is a curious fact that the industrial
mechanical progress of the last half century has not from that period
marked any reliable principle of organisation by which one mechanical
operation is distinguished from another. They seem to run into one
another without any definite outline of distinction.'[27]

The metal trades were much less mechanised than the engineering
industry by the early nineteenth century, and change was more gradual.
The nail trade was still largely a hand process, though some not wholly
effective nail-making machinery had been introduced by the 1830s.[28]

The Sheffield metal trades continued as hand trades into the 1860s.[29]

Porter reports that most small wares were still made by individual
workmen undertaking orders from merchants and agents, though there
had been some change in the organisation of production by the 1830s
and 1840s. The need for cheap sources of power had led to the con-
centration of workmen in large premises, yet these still continued to
work as individuals.

A building containing a great number of rooms of various sizes
is furnished with a steam engine, working shafts from which
are placed in each apartment or workshop, which is likewise
furnished with a lathe, benches and such other conveniences
as are suited to the various branches of manufacture for which
the rooms are likely to be needed. When a workman has
received an order for the supply of such a quantity of goods as
will occupy him a week, or a month, or any other given time
for their completion, he hires one or more of these rooms, of
sizes and with conveniences suited to his particular wants,
stipulating for the use of a certain amount of steam power.
He thus realizes all the advantages that would accompany the
possession of a steam engine; and as the buildings there fitted
up are numerous, competition on the part of their owners has
brought down the charge for the accommodation they offer
to the lowest rates that will ensure to them the ordinary rate of
profit on the capital employed.[30]

Hand techniques continued to dominate many other industries for
most of the nineteenth century. Leather manufacture, shoemaking,
glove- and hatmaking, and rein making were among the many industries
which in mid-Victorian times still depended on skill and labour. The
boot and shoe trade was changed not by mechanisation, but by the sub-
division of labour. People were measured for boots made by hand. The
few 'factories' which existed in Staffordshire and Northamptonshire
were really shops, where the leather was cut up by hand and given out
to bootmakers working in their own houses.[31] In pinmaking, although
Wright's pinworking machine was introduced in 1824, there were so
many technical difficulties that forty years later the 'nobbing' or head-
ing of the pin was still often done by hand.[32] Mining, quarrying, market
gardening and the food industries, building and construction, glass,
pottery, woodworking, and aspects of metallurgy were expanded and
transformed through the use of more labour and more skill, and not
through mechanisation.[33]

In sum, mechanisation in early nineteenth-century Britain was a
complex and uneven process; large parts of the country and many
sectors of the economy were changing very slowly, and even in the
most rapidly transforming areas there were many surviving legacies.
The amount of craft and small-scale industry was high and expanding
rapidly. Yet in many ways this was merely another aspect of industrial-
isation. As David Landes has emphasised, the whole tendency of
industrialisation and urbanisation was to specialise labour even fur-
ther and to break down the versatility of the household. This in itself
led to the expansion of a whole range of occupations and a general
rise in consumption, and the greater portion of consumption devoted
to manufacturing and services had the impact of stimulating tradition-
ally organised trades as well as newly mechanised ones. Furthermore,
certain kinds of technological advance created craft and domestic
industry where these had not existed before, or at least extended them
beyond their traditional boundaries. A type of symbiotic relationship
developed between the mechanised and hand sectors in many branches
of industry. The impact of the railway, for instance, was quite unex-
pected. For, where the advances of the railway had generated pre-

dictions that the use of 1,000,000 horses would be superseded allowing
for the subsistence of 8,000,000 human beings, the railway instead had
the effect of increasing the demand on the horse.[34] However, as Landes
also says, factory industry was the trend. From 1834 to 1850 the number
of cotton-mill operatives rose from 220,825 to 330,924 despite gains
in productivity.[35] Factory employment rose rapidly in the paper, leather
and metal industries, and the main industries in metals and engineer-
ing were gaining in size, precision and regularity. The steam engine
had come to stay, and the public recognised this. Phenomena such as
the public inquiry in 1819 and 1820 into the impact of steam engines
and furnaces on public health, and the government promotion of
investigation into designs for reducing the amount of smoke created
by furnaces, indicated a recognition of the machine,[86] and simply an
attempt to deal with some of its more obviously harmful effects. The
machine and the factory marked out the future of the age. As Landes
has put it:

The census returns and other numbers to be found between
the covers of the dusty parliamentary papers are the economic
historians' butterfly under glass or frog in formaldehyde -
without the virtue of wholeness to compensate for their lifeless-
ness. As described by occupational data, the British economy
of 1851 may not seem very different from that of 1800. But
these numbers merely describe the surface of the society - and
even then in terms that define away change by using categories
of unchanging nomenclature. Beneath this surface, the vital
organs were transformed; and though they weighed but a
fraction of the total - whether measured by people or wealth
— it was they that determined the metabolism of the entire
system.[87]

In the fragile and uncertain society of the 1820s and 1830s the
machine had thus implanted itself on the landscape as well as on the
imagination. The question to raise was, therefore, not whether it would

come or go, but what type of impact it would have. For some it still
seemed possible to stop the 'unnatural' progress of the machine, but
this was only in order to start afresh - to direct from a new beginning
the speed and form of its advance. Rather than considering simply the
existence of the machine, the debate on the machinery question in the
early nineteenth century involved assessing the impact it would have
on economy and society, and the possibility of modifying and re-
directing this impact.

##### The advent of political economy

As industrialisation began several decades before 1800, so the Machinery
Question had antecedents in eighteenth-century economic debate. I
will now turn to these antecedents, and will then go on to examine
the parallel emergence of the machinery question and the discipline of
political economy in the early nineteenth century. This chapter will
suggest that it was not just the economic context of rapid mechan-
isation, but also the intellectual context of the early years of political
economy, which helped to bring the machinery question to the fore.
Conversely, I shall argue that it was the problem presented to writers
on economic affairs of explaining and justifying the rapid technological
transformation which was formative in the development of political
economy as a discipline in the early nineteenth century.
Even in the early stages of industrialisation in the eighteenth century,
observers recognised the social implications of the machine. The early
literary and philosophical societies in the late eighteenth century ex-
tolled the 'improvement' made manifest in the machine. They began to
explore the connections between scientific discovery and the remark-
able advances in technology they were beginning to witness. There was
also a pamphlet literature on machinery riots. Fairly typical pamphlets
were Thomas Barnes's Thoughts on the Use of Machines in the Cotton
_Manufacture Addressed to the Working People in that Manufacture_
_by a Friend of the Poor, Manchester, 1780,[1] and the anonymous Letters_

_on the Utility of Employing Machines to Shorten Labour, 1780.[2]_

At a more theoretical level, Adam Smith and Lord Lauderdale dis-
cussed central issues in the development of technology and its relation-
ship to the dynamic transformation of the economy. Smith's theory of
the division of labour was basic to his analysis of rising labour
productivity, and formed the cornerstone of his theory of economic
growth. Lauderdale was more interested in capital formation, and
came by this route to examine the economic impact of the machine.
Smith connected the division of labour with several factors contri-
buting to greater productivity of labour. These factors were greater
dexterity, economy of time, and the introduction of machinery. Perhaps
the most far-reaching step Smith took in establishing these connections
was to show that the division of labour was self-reinforcing. It gave
rise to vital dynamic links between an expanding market, the regener-
ation of skills and the emergence of a class of machine makers.[3] The
definition of such connections between the market and the differen-
tiation of technique brought with it a change in the meaning of the
word skill. Skill, once identified with an[ c]art[5] or craft, became in Smith's
hands a 'peculiar dexterity' which resulted from the breakdown of a
craft.[4] The division of labour now became the material basis for a
separation between mental and manual labour. The leisure it allowed
the members of some classes gave them the time and cultural scope
necessary to scientific discovery. This division between the labourer
and the natural philosopher justified further social hierarchies, and
Smith was, therefore, able to account for the separation between the
machine maker and the machine minder.[5]

Smith established the equally important dynamic interaction of the
accumulation of capital and technical progress: 'As the division of
labour advances, therefore, in order to give constant employment to
an equal number of workmen, an equal stock of provisions, and a
greater stock of materials and tools than what would have been neces-
sary in a ruder state of things, must be accumulated beforehand.'[6] The
connection Smith established between capital accumulation and
technical change allowed him to ignore labour displacement:[ c]But the

number of workmen in every branch of business generally increases with
the division of labour in that branch; or rather it is the increase of their
number which enables them to class and subdivide themselves in this
manner.[57] Machinery did not displace labour. Rather, it differentiated
this labour by dismembering the old craft.
Lauderdale presented the process of technical change somewhat
differently. Where Smith envisaged the expansion of employment in
the process of capital formation and the division of labour, Lauderdale
argued that the introduction of machinery was purely a labour-saving
device. He referred to the stocking knitters and the new machine looms:
'The profit of stock employed in machinery is paid out of a fund that
would otherwise be destined to pay the wages of the labour it supplants.'[8]

Furthermore, Lauderdale related the impact of labour-saving machinery
to the social conflict of his own time : 'It derives ample testimony of its
truth from the conduct of the unlettered manufacturers themselves, as
is sufficiently evinced by the riots that have taken place on the intro-
duction of various pieces of machinery, and particularly at the time
when the ingenious machines for carding and spinning were first set
a-going.'[9] Smith did not refer to such social conflict, but he did show
concern for the mental and cultural degeneration produced among the
lower classes by the division of labour.
Moreover, both Smith and Lauderdale were worried about the con-
nections between this degeneration and the inventive capacity of a
nation. Both argued that the division of labour could have a stultifying
effect on ingenuity. Smith identified barbarous societies with varied
occupation : 'Invention is kept alive, and the mind is not suffered to
fall into that drowsy stupidity, which, in civilized society, seems to
benumb the understanding of almost all the inferior ranks of people.'[10]

Lauderdale, too, believed that there was a logical gap between the
division of labour and the type of conceptualisation necessary to the
invention of machinery. The principle behind the invention of
machinery was to combine and embrace within one machine the exe-
cution of the greatest possible variety of operations in the formation of
a commodity. But the division of labour was destructive of the chain of
reasoning necessary to the perfection of machinery.[11]

Smith and Lauderdale thus demonstrated an awareness of the social

and economic dimensions of the new techniques of production. But,
although we find in their writing both an impressive depth of analysis
of technology and an ambivalence towards this technology which pro-
vided many nineteenth-century economic writers with their starting-
points, the context was not one to make the machinery question a vital
issue. In the first place the economic context was different. In part, the
significance of the machinery question was defined by the economic and
technological transformation which is described in the last chapter. The
early nineteenth-century British economy was one where mechanisation
was strikingly evident, but where large sectors of the economy still
remained untouched by it. This technological setting was comple-
mented by an economy recovering from war. Crisis, depression, and
unemployment appeared to contemporaries to owe their causes as much
to the new technology as to post-war economic adjustment. A second
and equally important context for the emergence of the machinery
question as a national issue was an intellectual one. Machinery became
an issue at virtually the same time as the formation of a new intellectual
discipline : political economy. It was no mere coincidence that political
economy established itself as an academic discipline and popular
doctrine at the same time as the industrial revolution in cotton and iron.
For it was only from the 1790s that political economy broke free
from the place allotted to it by previous writers, including Adam Smith,
as a branch of legislation or statesmanship. The theories and opinions
to be found in earlier economic writings were not systematically set out,
as were those in nineteenth-century political economy, as an accepted
set of concepts and problems whose central purpose was to analyse the
present position and future prospects of the economy. Significantly,
Adam Smith's first intellectual biographer and re-interpreter, Dugald
Stewart, was one of those who led the way in the 1790s in assigning the
theory of government and political economy to two separate branches
of political science. Political economy he defined as 'that which is most
immediately connected with human happiness and improvement[5]: it
could be 'studied without reference to constitutional forms - not only
because the tendency of laws may be investigated abstractly from all
considerations of their origin but because there are many principles of
political economy which may be sanctioned by governments very dif-
ferent in their constitutions.'[12]

**_Works of Dugald Stewart ed. by Sir William Hamilton, Edinburgh,_**
**1855, vol. vra, p. 24.**


-----

This appointment of political economy to a separate branch of in-
quiry was followed some years later by J. R. McCulloch's attempt to
explain its emergence on materialist grounds. The science could only
arise, he argued, in a commercial capitalist society. Slave societies had
no knowledge of the categories political economy dealt in, for they had
no experience of relations between landlords and tenants, and between
masters and servants. They could therefore take 'no interest in questions
rising out of the rise and fall of rents and wages'. A further reason for
the science emerging as late as it did was social climate 'prejudicial' in
ancient and medieval economies to the accumulation of wealth and to
commerce and manufacture.[13] The writer who reviewed McCulloch's
tract for the Edinburgh Review tied the discipline more explicitly to
recent improvements in industry. He claimed that political economy
was the science which could teach us how to make industry more pro-
ductive, and was therefore 'the science to which we are indebted for
all the higher refinements'. It was in countries 'where circumstances
were favourable or where political economy was well understood' that
an intelligent artisan could 'enjoy a multiplicity of comforts and
luxuries' which were 'utterly unattainable in a rude state of society'.[14]

Halevy, a subsequent observer, also made some connection between
economic change and the emergence of political economy. Singling out
the period between Smith and Ricardo as one in which not one single
complete treatise on political economy had appeared in England,
Halevy argued that, without the assistance or knowledge of the
legislature, or even of the intellectuals, a new industrial world had
arisen. This transformation brought with it, he argued, a whole series
of problems leading on the one hand to the great series of parliamentary
inquiries, and on the other, in the theoretical sphere, to the theory of
rent.[15]

Developing the implications of this remark, I would argue that
Dugald Stewart's definition of the economy as an object of inquiry
separate from the state or polity was in fact the first stage in the
formation of the discipline of political economy as a response to the
need to understand the economy. He not only defined political economy

as a separate discipline; he regarded it as the most important discipline
to the happiness of mankind. He argued that 'mistaken notions
concerning political liberty so widely disseminated in Europe by the
writings of Locke have contributed greatly to divert the studies of
speculative politicians from the proper objects of their attention'.[16]

Happiness was the only object of legislation which was of intrinsic
value, and 'of the two branches of political science - the theory of
government and political economy - the latter is that which is most
immediately connected with human happiness and improvement[5].[17]

Such statements account in intellectual terms for the beginnings of
a separate existence for political economy and of claims for its signifi-
cance in providing fundamental directions and principles for govern-
ment policy. But behind such reasons were to be found other deeper
motivations, as hinted at by McCulloch, to understand the economy
and a specific desire, perceived by Halevy, to understand an economy
cast in the turbulence of rapid technological change.
Few historians, however, have given much attention to possible con-
nections between the parallel development of industry and political
economy, and there are clear historiographical reasons for this.
Orthodox historians, fearing that they lacked expertise, have only paid
lip-service to the significance of political economy, and have deferred
to the judgements of economists who specialise in the history of economic
thought. But these have not filled the gap, for they have their own
concerns and orientations. Since the foundations of their discipline
economists have been interested in the antecedents of their own theories.
But the uncovering of antecedents is rarely a problem for the historian.
However much we may know of the 'precursors' of a wide range of
concepts and theories currently in vogue among economists, we actually
know very little about the more fundamental problem of the origin of
the discipline. This is because the question has just not been asked. It
is, nevertheless, the most important historical question in any study
of political economy or economic policy which requires an answer. In
contrast with the economist, the historian wants to know what hap-
pened and why, and to explain change and development. The
historian's history of economic thought should seek to explain what
economists were doing in the past and the reasons for their work.
Furthermore, it should seek to inscribe in the history of ideas the
personal and social contexts of the theorists.

The historian thus aspiring to understand the nature of the con-
nection between industrialisation and political economy must obviously
inquire into the intellectual developments which gave rise to a new
discipline. But he must also understand the political dimensions of
economic debate at the time, and the social nexus and institutional
organisation of political economy during the years of its formation.
Dugald Stewart's long and influential tenure in the Chair of Moral
Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh spanned the period of
transition between the end of the Scottish Enlightenment and the
emergence of the philosophic radicalism and whig liberalism which
was to set the intellectual tone for the first part of the nineteenth century.
The radical intellectual attitudes and innovative social theories which
had characterised the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century were
displaced in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the onset of
the political reaction of the 1790s. The French Revolution which
marked the culmination of the European Enlightenment led in Britain
to political retrenchment, and to the exile, both voluntary and en-
forced, of intellectuals from cultural centres in Scotland and the North
of England.
Political economy was to emerge in a new intellectual and political
setting. Tied neither to a wider social theory nor to a political vision,
it was to become a discipline apart - a set of principles to guide
economic policy. This is not to say that the new discipline was apolitical.
Rather, it developed against the background of the Whig and Tory
struggles over how to solve the immediate problems of economic crisis
and depression and the longer-term problems of how to adjust to rapid
industrialisation.
At a general level, it is probably correct to depict the struggle in
economics in the period between Adam Smith and the ascendancy of
Ricardo as representative of that between land and industry. Ricardo,
in fact, formulated his ideas in confrontation with the legacy of
physiocracy and agricultural expansion. His own perspectives trans-
mitted an older ideology which had selected passages out of Smithian
economics and interpreted them as justifying the new industrial
capitalism. And the ideologues of landed society continued to uphold
the under-consumptionist theories of a gentry economics averse to
industrialisation.[18]

This bold demarcation between the economics of land and industry
must, however, be subject to many qualifications. Among those ranked
on either side of this theoretical divide there were great differences in
assumptions and allegiances. Furthermore, broad political divisions
between types of economic theory in ascendancy were complemented
by more specific divisions over policy, and these policy stands can be
identified over the series of crises which punctuated the period between
1815 and the 1840s. For such crises commentators could offer a wide
choice of diagnoses, between blaming trade restrictions or over-
production, taxation or the paper currency, over-population or
machinery. But each economic diagnosis was also a political choice,
as differing schools of economic thought in these years also reflected
differences in politics. G. S. L. Tucker has aptly formulated the
connections of nineteenth-century theories of profit with practical
questions of economic policy. The intellectual interest in explaining a
secular decline in the earnings of capital was a feeble incentive beside
the desire to account for the facts of contemporary experience and to
give some guidance to economic policy in wartime and post-war
Britain. The Corn Laws, the national debt, taxation, foreign investment
and colonial development, the introduction of machinery, financial
crises and trade fluctuations, were all problems requiring some analysis
of the direction of profits.[19]

Thus theoretical controversy often involved political controversy,
particularly between the Whigs and the Tories. The period 1815 to 1832
was dominated by the Tory ministries, all of which took on the policy
prescriptions of the classical economists. As A. J. B. Hilton has put it,
these governments 'broke with physiocracy, autarchy and agricultural
expansion'.[20] They dismissed the benefit of public works and denied
the permanent effects of a post-war glut. The alliance of Toryism and
classical economics was, however, countered by a definite political
economy of opposition. The Whigs were left to maintain a radical
under-consumptionist theory. Policy prescriptions involved public

spending and tax reduction. This was an activist policy founded on the
basic fear of Malthus that demand might not keep up with production.
The machinery question arose on the basis of these two overlapping
problems of economic policy - the long-term problem of adjustment
to an industrialising economy and the short-term problem of explaining
and solving a long series of economic crises. Machinery was considered
to be a major component of both these issues of economic policy. The
solutions put forward for these problems, though politically motivated,
required the emergence of recognisable sets of economic principles.
For a set of principles which could account for long-term and short-
term economic phenomena would provide the basis for more effective
and politically convincing economic policy. The intellectual interest
which writers on economic issues may have had in the machinery
question was thus complemented by a political interest in explanation
and policy. Together, these brought political economy to the fore as
the rising academic discipline in vogue in the early nineteenth century,
both intellectually and politically.
The popularity of the discipline was not just founded on intellectual
and political events. It also had a social base. In the last part of the
eighteenth century and very early nineteenth century the economic
writings of Adam Smith were taken up in radical intellectual circles
and adopted by those interested in political reform. It was the pro-
gressive social philosophy that attracted the luminaries of the eighteenth-
century literary and philosophical societies and the Jacobin activists.
The economy stimulated the imaginations of those such as Thomas
Barnes and Thomas Henry who lectured the Manchester Literary and
Philosophical Society in the 1780s on the connections between the
sciences, the arts, and manufacture.[21] The formulation of economic
principles also attracted the interest of the Jacobin sons of the first
generation of Lancashire cotton masters. Thomas Walker, Thomas
Cooper, James Watt Jr. and Samuel Jackson introduced other young
industrialists in Manchester to principles of liberal economic and politi-
cal reform through reading Adam Smith, Priestley and Bentham in
such societies as the Junior Literary and Philosophical Society, the
Sciolous Society, and the Weekly Literary and Scientific Society.[22]

This young radical liberal following gave to the origins of political

economy a social base that was liberal, middle-class, provincial and
industrial. Though this base changed after the first years of the century
to encompass the followers of a much more establishment form of
liberalism and even of progressive Toryism, political economy never lost
its cultural stamp throughout the first half of the nineteenth century.
The first social following of this new discipline was one involved even
to the grassroots levels in those economic and technological trans-
formations which made the machinery question an issue of such social
relevance.
Another slightly later social basis for political economy was provided
by the metropolitan radicalism of the Benthamite cause, but this was
never to be as extensive as the philosophic radicals hoped. A narrow
sectarian group, they aspired to attach Ricardian political economy to
their own political doctrines. They attempted this unsuccessfully in the
Political Economy Club, and nurtured liberal debating teams for the
London Debating Society and the London Co-operative Society. In
addition, James Mill took on the role of shaping Ricardo into a
parliamentary spokesman for the Benthamite cause.
Ricardo's rise to popularity was helped by an institutional frame-
work. Just as significantly, however, his great prestige changed the
character of these institutions. Political economy had many voices
during this period, and its institutions - the clubs, journals, and news-
papers which helped give definition to the discipline - were not simply
avenues for dogma. The Political Economy Club was the most prestig-
ious of these forums. Mallet's diary of the Club's proceedings during
this period bears eloquent testimony to the great diversity of interests
within the Club.[23] Founded by Tooke and the originators of the
Merchant's Petition of 1820, the Club had a practical and not a sec-
tarian character.
A plethora of literary reviews also encompassed political economy
in their subject matter. Political economy was popular in both the
_Edinburgh Review and the Westminster Review. Both, however,_
practised exclusion of heretical views on political economy at some
time.[24] Wide ranging criticism of Ricardian views was kept up by the
_Quarterly Review, the British Critic, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine_

and the Monthly Review. Theoretical debate was even conducted in
the newspapers - particularly in the Morning Chronicle, and Torrens's
papers, the Globe and Traveller and The Champion™
Beyond this institutional framework, the popular and political
impact of Ricardo's work was to extend the identity between political
economy and capitalism. But such an identity was by no means easily
accepted. Alternative principles and methods were constantly put for-
ward even during the time when Ricardo's views had their greatest
influence. Spokesmen for the landed and the working classes both
subjected Ricardian political economy to intensive criticism, and
attempted to formulate a substitute set of doctrines more in tune with
their own political perspectives. The result was a great deal of contro-
versy, both methodological and theoretical, in the emerging discipline.
J. R. McCulloch, Ricardo's vociferous populariser, was very worried
about 'recent great differences among its most eminent professors'.[26]

And even Malthus, Ricardo's eminent critic and leading advocate of
the under-consumptionist theories which appealed to landed society,
felt, 'An agreement among the principal writers in Political Economy
is very desirable with a view to the authority of the science in its
practical application.'[27] During these very early stages of the shaping
of political economy as a discipline, controversy among its advocates
was rife and ranged from political principles and policy to the smallest
details of economic theory. The occasion for such extensive controversy
was not just capitalism, but industrial capitalism. Ricardo's own
intervention was impelled by the vital issues of the contemporary
economy, but his unconventional concepts and assumptions did not
dissipate debate: they intensified it. It was, however, to be Ricardo's
contribution which would be decisive, for all other economists of the
day would answer to his work.

###### PART TWO THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF MACHINERY

##### Ricardo's chapter

Ricardo created a new conception of political economy. Against a
background of institutional and theoretical diversity in the discipline
he moulded an original and unified body of theory. To contemporaries
this appeared as a consolidated set of principles so systematic in nature
as to be called a science. But it also appeared as a corpus of doctrine so
strictly applied and so closely connected to politics and personalities
that it became a creed termed Ricardianism.
Ricardo's originality lay partly in his methodology, for his system-
atic approach to political economy involved the explicit use of models
as a basis for explanation. But it also lay in the combination of prob-
lems, judgements and conclusions he so effectively combined to provide
the authority needed by contemporaries seeking a policy in a very con-
fused economic setting. Ricardo's intervention both in politics and
theory provided the connection between appraisal and policy required
at the time for the strains of an unprecedented and complicated
economic transformation.
The received view of classical political economy in this period
emphasises its pessimism. Adam Smith's sanguine affirmation of the
implications of the division of labour is contrasted with 'Malthusian*
fears of overpopulation, 'Ricardian' predictions of the advent of the
stationary state, and the classicals' apparent indifference to the impact
of technological change. Schumpeter's criticism and explanation of
the 'pessimistic' perspective supposedly to be found in the works of
Ricardo, Malthus and Mill are exemplary of many.


-----

Those writers lived at the threshold of the most spectacular
economic development ever witnessed. Vast possibilities
matured into realities under their very eyes. Nevertheless they
saw nothing but cramped economies, struggling with ever
decreasing success for their daily bread. They were convinced
that technological progress and the increase in capital would
in the end fail to counteract the fateful law of decreasing
returns.[1]

In this chapter I shall seek to refute the standard view of Ricardo's
pessimism by a close textual analysis of his writing on technical change,
interpreted in the context of his works as a whole. Such an analysis will
involve not only the reconstitution of his basic theory, but also the
examination of his commentary on contemporary developments. In
doing this I follow the essential structure of his Principles, where
theoretical chapters on political economy were followed first by those
on taxation and policy and then by those making a polemical inter-
vention in contemporary debates. I shall give close attention to
Ricardo's specific remarks on the impact of technical change, and also
on its sources and mechanisms. At the same time, reference to the
context provided by Rieardo's work as a whole should make it possible
to identify the place of such remarks in his general theory. The task of
this chapter will thus be to identify these remarks, to locate their
theoretical context, and to assess their significance therein. The result will
show just how extreme are interpretations, such as Schumpeter's, which
criticise Ricardo for 'pessimism' and for ignoring technological change.
This approach to Ricardo's work as a whole should then allow an
understanding and interpretation of the chapter on machinery which
Ricardo added to the third edition of his Principles in 1821. In this
very short but provocative piece Ricardo found some reason to support
workers who resisted the introduction of new technology. His chapter
created a furore of debate among contemporary political economists,
and historians of economic thought have equally always found it
puzzling. But if it is examined in the context of Ricardo's work as a
whole and in the wider context of the debate on machinery, neither
the issues it raises nor its analysis and conclusions would appear to
contradict the rest of Ricardo's work as much as some historians have
argued.
Formally, my analysis of Ricardian economics will be divided into

separate sections discussing Ricardo's ideas on the distribution of income
and technical change, his view of the process of mechanisation, and
his opinions and predictions on the condition and future of machinery
and labour.

_The distribution of income and technical change_
The distribution of income was central to Ricardo's theories of economic
growth. Since Ricardo assumed that all accumulation was derived
from profits, the rate of accumulation was determined by the distri-
bution of income between profits and other relative income shares.
Technical change was relevant to the distribution of income in so far
as Ricardo believed it would offset the effects of diminishing returns,
raise profit shares, and thus increase the rate of accumulation.
Some commentators, such as G. S. L. Tucker and Luigi Pasinetti,[2]

have interpreted Ricardo's theory of income distribution to mean that
he did not consider technical change to be an important factor in his
economic system. Tucker maintains that Ricardo assumed an economy
with no capital-saving innovations and no improvements in technical
knowledge. In his view Ricardo only admitted the effects of improve-
ments as modifications at the end of his analysis.[3] Pasinetti has gone
even further to argue that the law of diminishing returns (that is, the
view that, with all other things equal, after a certain point there would
be diminishing marginal returns for every increment of investment) was
unnecessary. Unnecessary both to the theory of population and to
Ricardian rent theory it functions only, he argues, as an analytical tool,
making Malthus's principle of population and Ricardo's gloomy view
of capitalist development impregnable to criticism.[4]

I will argue in this section that such interpretations are not adequate,
since they do not explain what purposes and explanatory uses Ricardo
envisaged for his model of income distribution. The case I will present
can be outlined as follows: Ricardo formulated a strict model of in-
come distribution — a model of what he called 'natural tendencies'. He
then took up the greater part of his Principles specifying the conditions
under which such 'natural tendencies' came into play and the factors
which would limit and prevent such prospects. Ricardo's model was
constructed for particular analytical purposes. These purposes were not,

however, the straightforward ones of proving predictive accuracy and
explanatory powers.
The Ricardian economic model assumed that land was limited, that
there was no technological improvement, and no international trade.
In this closed economy model he made rates of capital accumulation
and population growth comparable, so that with the expansion of this
'natural economy' real wages would remain the same. The point of
Ricardo's exercise in constructing such a model was to allow him to
separate the effects respectively of the growth of capital, the rise of
population, and the extension of this population to less fertile lands.[5]

He wished to analyse just what effect each of these would have in an
economy which could expand neither through technological improve-
ment nor international trade.
Under Ricardo's model of the natural economy, the increase of
capital and population would have to involve resort to the cultivation
of less fertile land. This would lead to a decline in the rate of profit,
determined as it was by costs of production on marginal land. Thus
economic growth in a closed economy with no opportunities for tech-
nological progress would lead to successive reductions in the rate of
profit until the point was reached at which there would be no further
incentive for investment: in other words, the stationary state. These
were, indeed, gloomy prospects. But the question is, how real were
Ricardo's fears?
It is interesting to note that throughout his explication of this model,
Ricardo wrote of all its components and movements in terms of what
was 'natural[5]. He refers to the 'nature of man' and the 'natural limits
to population growth'.[8] There was a 'natural price of labour' and a
'natural price of commodities'.[7] The 'natural operation of the propor-
tion of supply and demand' went with the 'natural advance of society'
and the 'natural tendency of profits to fall'.[8] The dynamic of the
economy would gravitate to the operations of the 'laws of nature'.[9]

I will argue that Ricardo, in fact, drew a sharp distinction between
this 'natural world[5] and the socio-economic world he was attempting
to analyse. This model of 'natural tendencies' had a negative purpose.
It was a counterfactual, set up precisely in order to emphasise the sig-
nificance of the factors from which Ricardo abstracted - free trade
and technological improvement. The model thus drew attention to
these two vital means of escaping the restraints imposed on the rate
of capital accumulation by limited land and excessive population
growth. Trade and technical progress both produced social and econo-
mic changes which considerably modified the 'natural state[5] of limited
land.
Ricardo made his views on the role of both factors quite clear even
in his first outline of the strict model in his Essay on Profits of 1815.
For he concluded this Essay with the comment: 'I shall greatly regret
that considerations for any particular class, are allowed to check the
progress of the wealth and population of the country.' If the interests
of the landlord against the free importation of corn were to be allowed,
'let us by the same act arrest improvement, and prohibit importation[5].[10]

The model of 'natural tendencies[5] made the effects of carrying out such
acts crystal clear.
Ricardo[5]s purpose in using such a model to demonstrate certain
practical and empirical points must, however, be distinguished from his
longer run vision of economic growth. For Ricardo did believe that
the expansion of an economy faced ultimate limits in the effects of two
tendencies: excessive population growth and diminishing returns. He
did not, however, attach very much empirical significance to these
tendencies, and regarded the limits they imposed on economic expan-
sion in purely analytical terms. In using these tendency statements and
seeking the limits of his analysis Ricardo was simply stating some basic
axioms on which to base a contingency prediction : this was a method
familiar to strict logical argument. He also maintained these assump-
tions in order to bring them into play to explain the inducements to
technological change and the drive to expand markets. I will discuss
this in more detail in the third section of this chapter, 'Technical
change: mechanisms and processes.'
A number of historians have begun to emphasise the particular pur-
pose of Ricardo[5]s model of distribution in relation to contemporary
policy concern with international trade. Both Mark Blaug and Maurice
Dobb have argued that its significance is only to be understood in the

context of the Corn Laws. Blaug has pointed out that hindrances to
foreign trade were major conditions prompting a tendency for the rate
of profit to fall. The stationary state was therefore, he argues, Ricardo's
'methodological fiction': 'The alleged "pessimism" of Ricardo was
entirely contingent upon the maintenance of the tariff on raw produce
. . . the notion of an impending stationary state was at most a useful
devise for frightening the friends of protection.'[11] Dobb gives additional
emphasis to the importance Ricardo attached to foreign trade. He cites
Ricardo's argument in his article in the Encyclopaedia Britannica that,
if food and raw materials were supplied from abroad in exchange for
manufactured goods, 'it is difficult to see where the limit is at which
you cease to accumulate wealth and to derive profit from its employ-
ment'.[12] He uses an even more forceful statement in a letter by Ricardo
to Trower in 1820 : 'I contend for free trade in corn on the ground that
while trade is free, and corn cheap, profits will not fall however great
be the accumulation of capital.'[13] Such evidence vindicated Edwin
Cannan's judgement that 'as a basis for an argument against the Corn
Laws it would have been difficult to find anything more effective than
the Ricardian theory of distribution'.[14]

In fact these were not only Ricardo's programmatic and personal
opinions, they were equally to be found in the argument of the Principles.
In the chapter on profits he distinguished the future of an 'extensive
country with land of poor quality and where the import of food is
prohibited', from that of 'small fertile countries' with free import of
food. In the first, even a very small accumulation of capital would
result in a fall in the rate of profit and a greater rise in rents.[15]

More recently, Samuel Hollander has sought to restrict the signifi-
cance of Ricardo's distribution model still further by arguing that even
in the absence of Corn Law repeal Ricardo was optimistic about
Britain's growth prospects. He was sufficiently confident of the dyn-
amic growth of the economy and continued capital formation to play
down the adverse effects of the Corn Laws and the Poor Law. Hollander
draws attention to the dispute between McCulloch and Ricardo over

the latter's speech to the House of Gommons in March 1821. Ricardo's
speech minimised the negative effects of agricultural protection upon
the rate of domestic accumulation. McCulloch, by contrast, regarding
himself as a carrier of Ricardian orthodoxy, insisted that the great
source of Britain's difficulty lay in a low rate of return due mainly to
the Corn Laws. Hollander notes the significance Ricardo attached to
the allocation of capital and influences on accumulation, and argues
that part of the explanation for his optimism is to be found in his
recognition of agricultural innovation and the effects of technological
progress in manufacturing.[18] Hollander points out that technical change
may have mattered to him as much as did foreign trade. I will now
make the case that Ricardo did indeed attach a significance to technical
change at least equal to that he gave to foreign trade.
The interpretations of Blaug, Dobb, and Hollander of the contextual
framework of Ricardo's theory significantly modify the import of the
Ricardian models of distribution and accumulation. If, as I have argued
above, the theoretical implications of Ricardo's restrictive models were
meant to be negative, precisely in order to emphasise the practical
significance of those factors from which he abstracted, then technical
change as well as free trade would be prominent features in his dynamic
forecasts.
In several places Ricardo clearly emphasised that the effect of
machinery was similar to that of foreign trade. If the introduction of
cheap foreign goods reduced costs of production and therefore lowered
value, then technical change had an analogous effect. If cheap foreign
goods lowered the costs of labourers' subsistence, thus reducing the
wage share and bringing about a rise in profits, then so also did the
extension of machinery.[17] Blaug and Dobb have shown that Ricardo's
well-known intervention in the debates on the Corn Laws may reason-
ably influence the interpretation of his model of distribution because of
the intimate connection between this policy context and his theoretical
analysis of foreign trade. Hollander, though sceptical of the importance
Ricardo attached to the repeal of the Cbrn Laws, likewise argues that
Ricardo did not draw conclusions pessimistic of Britain's growth
prospects from his theoretical growth model, and that he was well
aware of the real 'dynamism of the British economy', despite protection.
I would now add to these studies the suggestion that there was an

_The_

equally important connection between Ricardian theory and its public
context in the case of technical change and the machinery debates.
We must first consider the explicit examination made by Ricardo of
the impact of technical change, both in agriculture and industry, on
distributive shares.
Even in his earliest writings Ricardo drew attention to improvement:
'If by foreign commerce, or the discovery of machinery, the commodities
consumed by the labourer should become much cheaper, wages would
fall; and this, as we have before observed, would raise the profits of
the farmer, and therefore, all other profits.[518] In addition, such improve-
ments would 'lower for a time rents[3].[19] Wage and rent shares would
also fall and the profit share would rise if capitalists simply reduced
their levels of investment. For in the economy with no technological
improvements, high levels of investment placed strains on the market
for land and labour, forcing the extension of cultivation to less
productive land and raising the costs of workers' subsistence. The
remaining profit share would therefore be correspondingly reduced. In
such circumstances the only means of maintaining a share of profits
sufficient to prevent the onset of the stationery state was to introduce
measures preventing high rates of accumulation. Retrogression of this
kind was not, however, necessary to maintain the rate of profit, and
Ricardo emphasised this in the first edition of the Principles: 'The same
effects may, however, be produced, when the wealth and population
of a country are increased, if that increase is accompanied by such
marked improvements in agriculture, as shall have the same effects
of diminishing the necessity of cultivating the poorer lands, or of
expanding the same amount of capital on the cultivation of the more
fertile portions.'[20]

Ricardo thus envisaged two types of capital accumulation. The first
took place in a situation of no technical change. When capital was
accumulated without technical change, its labour cost of production,
that is, its value, also rose. Such accumulation demanded a widening
of the margins of cultivation and with it a rise in costs of production
overall, since costs were determined at the margin. Relative wage shares
thus rose and profit shares fell. Ricardo's second type of capital
accumulation can be described as capital-embodied technical change.
In this situation a capital stock could rise, while its value could simul-

**19 Ibid. p. 19.**
**20 Ricardo, Principles, p. 79.**


-----

taneously fall. Additions to capital need not entail the extension of the
margin of cultivation, for they could be made by the aid of machinery.
This would prevent any rise in necessary proportions of labour, and the
wage share could stay the same or fall.[21] In order to understand more
precisely the complexities of the impact of technical change on
distributive shares, it will be necessary to examine in turn wages, profits,
and rent.
The critical variable in the whole process of accumulation was the
share of wages. What did Ricardo mean by the share of wages, and
why did a high share of wages seem to be an indication of retro-
gression in the economy? The wage share was an aggregate of what
Ricardo termed the natural wage, as distinct from the' market wage'.
The natural wage was the cost of workers' subsistence. Ricardo's de-
finition of subsistence was not simply literal. It had a' social' element,
being dependent on the 'habits and customs of the people'.[22] Never-
theless, whatever the level of'social' subsistence, the natural wage
still had to be considered first in relation to the cost of food. For it
tended to rise with diminishing returns in agriculture, and the con-
sequent increase in food prices. If capital accumulation should occur
unaccompanied by technical change, and hence without offsetting
diminishing returns in agriculture, then the natural wage share would
rise. But, in fact, most capital accumulation was accompanied by
some improvements in technique which would prevent that eventu-
ality.

The natural price of all commodities, excepting raw produce
and labour, has a tendency to fall, in the progress of wealth
and population; for though, on the one hand, they axe enhanced
in real value, from the rise in the natural price of the raw
material of which they are made, this is more than counter-
balanced by the improvements in machinery, by the better
division and distribution of labour, and by the increasing skill,
both in science and art, of the producers.[23]

The wage share, of course, was also important to the condition of
the working classes. However, their actual condition was dependent,
not on the natural wage, but on the differential between this and the
market wage. In the process of capital accumulation and economic

**23 Ibid. pp. 93-4.**


-----

growth the latter would rise relative to the former, but the permanence
of any increased differential between them was of course also dependent
upon the movements of the natural wage. Where capital accumulation
took place without technical change, marginal costs of production
would ultimately rise. Any such rise in costs would also increase the
share of national income required by natural wages. And high wage
shares caused by a rise in the cost of subsistence would nullify the earlier
gains made by increasing the differential between natural and market
wages through gains in the latter. Ricardo could therefore derive from
his model the conclusion that technical change could improve the con-
dition of the working classes, by preventing a rise in the share of natural
wages.
However, Ricardo still held strong doubts about the permanence of
any gains to the wage-earning classes. Though technical change could
prevent a rise in the costs of the subsistence wage, high market wages
and a wide differential between market and natural wages would
provide an incentive for population growth. Ricardo endorsed Mat-
thusian population assumptions, and accordingly believed that any
differentials that arose between market and natural wages would soon
be liable to elimination by the effects of population growth.
On the other hand, Ricardo recognised that higher natural wages
need not carry a negative connotation. For such gains in the natural
wage could arise, not only from a higher population or higher cost of
production, but from gains in the levels of social subsistence.

The friends of humanity cannot but wish that in all countries
the labouring classes should have a taste for comforts and
enjoyments, and that they should be stimulated by all legal
means in their exertions to procure them. There cannot be a
better security against a superabundant population. In those
countries, where the labouring classes have the fewest wants,
and are contented with the cheapest food, the people are
exposed to the greatest vicissitudes and miseries.[24]

Ricardo not only believed that a high natural wage could have this
positive implication, but he thought that there was no practical necessity
for a convergence between market and natural wages. In an 'improving
society' market wages could stay indefinitely above natural wages, 'for
no sooner may the impulse, which an increased capital gives to a new

**24 Ibid. pp. 1 oo~ 1.**


-----

demand for labour be obeyed, than another increase of capital may
produce the same effect'.[25]

If this differential between market and natural wages could be
maintained for any length of time, either through the effects of an
increase in capital acting on the market wage, or through the effects of
technical progress on the natural wage, then it would create incentives
for a change in the levels of necessary social subsistence. Goods which
were formerly luxuries could become new needs, and, by this means,
social subsistence wage levels could rise. A rise in the social subsistence
or natural wage need not, therefore, reflect an increase in population.
It could in fact, by reducing the differential between market and
natural wages, have the effect of reducing population growth. This
type of increase in natural wages brought great gains to the condition
of the working classes. It was therefore in sharp contrast to the increase
in the natural wage share brought about by rising population and
rising marginal costs.
Ricardo noticed, moreover, that technical change not only affected
the level of social subsistence, but also affected the composition of that
subsistence. The extent to which technical change brought about a
substitution of manufactured for agricultural goods in the wage basket
had very real significance for the impact of the law of diminishing
returns. Ricardo explicitly dissociated himself from the view he attri-
buted to both Smith and Malthus, that the wage basket consisted en-
tirely of corn, so that population and profits could be tied entirely to
the provision of food.[26] That the wage basket might tend increasingly
to consist of more than food followed from the very logic of Ricardo's
model of accumulation: 'From manufactured commodities always
falling, and raw produce always rising, with the progress of society, such
a disproportion in their relative value is at length created, that in rich
countries a labourer, by the sacrifice of a very small quantity only of his
food, is able to provide liberally for all his other wants.[527] The fact that
workers could and did buy manufactured goods limited the impact

-----

over the whole economy of diminishing returns in the agricultural
sector. Ricardo, as Samuel Hollander has shown, recognised this even
before his Essay on Profits.[28] Ultimately the wage was the crucial
variable, not the price of corn. It is this attention which Ricardo gave
to the composition of the wage basket that led him to a very ambivalent
position on the Malthusian population theory. Ricardo's Notes on
_Malthus show that he found the Malthusian principle too crude_
theoretically,[29] but he endorsed the general dogma.[30] His ambivalence
shows even more clearly in the Principles where he argued that high
wages need not necessarily lead to population increase.

The amended condition of the labourer, in consequence of the
increased value which is paid him, does not necessarily oblige
him to marry and take upon himself the charge of a family -
he will, in all probability, employ a portion of his increased
wages in furnishing himself abundantly with food and
necessaries, - but with the remainder he may, if it please him,
purchase any commodities that may contribute to his enjoy-
ments - chairs, tables, and hardware; or better clothes, sugar,
and tobacco.[81]

Ricardo, however, stopped at this point and conceded the argument to
Malthus. In the same paragraph he concluded:

But although this might be the consequence of high wages, yet
so great are the delights of domestic society, that in practice it
is invariably found that an increase of population follows the
amended condition of the labourer; and it is only because it
does so, that, with the trifling exception already mentioned, a
new and increased demand arises for food. This demand then
is the effect of an increase of capital and population, but not
the cause - it is only because the expenditure of the people takes
this direction, that the market price of necessaries exceeds the
natural price, and that the quantity of food required is pro-
duced.[82]

Still, though Ricardo endorsed Malthusian assumptions on the induce-
ments to population growth, it is doubtful if he was as apprehensive of
overpopulation as were many of his contemporaries. Hollander goes so
far as to argue that Ricardo regarded the rapid contemporary growth
rate of population as necessary to meet the even greater rate of increase
of capital. Hollander cites Ricardo's comment that the pernicious effects
of the Poor Laws had, for this reason, not been felt in the context of
a rapidly expanding capital and growing economy. He argued, 'Happily
these laws have been in operation during a period of progressive pros-
perity, when the funds for the maintenance of labour have regularly
increased, and when an increase of population would be naturally
called for.[333] The[ c]pernicious nature of these laws' would only become
clear with the approach of the stationary state.
Ricardo's discussion of profits and technological improvement was
based almost entirely on what he had to say about wages. Technical
change did not have a direct impact on the rate of profit. Indeed,
profits changed, in any circumstances, only in response to developments
in the sector producing goods for the consumption of wage earners.
Technical change could thus be said to raise the rate of profit only to
the extent that it reduced the costs of 'wage goods'. Any change in
techniques which affected only luxury goods consumed by capitalists
and landlords could induce no change at all in the rate of profit. In an
extreme situation, where wage earners consumed only corn, technical
change in the industrial sector could affect prices, but not the rate of
profit.

The rate of profit is never increased by a better distribution of
labour, by the invention of machinery, by the establishment
of roads and canals, or by any means of abridging labour either
in the manufacture or in the conveyance of goods. These are
causes which operate on price and never fail to be beneficial
to the consumers,... but they have no effect whatever on
profit. On the other hand, every diminution in the wages of
labour raises profits, but produces no effect on the prices of
commodities.[84]

Perhaps one of the most longstanding and polemical concerns of the
issues arising from Ricardo's work on technology and distribution was

**38 Ibid. pp. 108-9, cited in Hollander, 'Ricardo and the Corn Laws',**
**p. 12.**
**54 Ricardo, Principles, p. 33.**


-----

that of the impact of improvements on rents. From his early corn model
through to the propositions of his Principles, Ricardo argued that the
necessary effect of both improvements and free trade in corn was the
reduction of rents. The proof took on the political form that the interest
of the landlord was opposed to that of every other class of the com-
munity.[35]

The level of rent on any one piece of land was established by the
differential productivities of successive capital inputs. Because Ricardo
assumed diminishing returns, there was a point beyond which each
successive capital input generated a lower return than the previous one.
Rent was determined by the difference between the return on the most
recent and least productive capital input and the previous and mar-
ginally more productive capital input. Rent was therefore established
at the margin of cultivation, and was high or low according to the
levels of capital accumulation required. When some event occurred
which had the effect of reducing the level of required capital accumu-
lation, this would allow for a retreat in the margin of cultivation, and
therefore in a reduction in the differentials or inequalities in the products
obtained from each successive capital input on the land. Because the
margin of cultivation had moved inwards and the capital costs of
cultivation had fallen, rents too would fall.[36] Agricultural improvements
and free trade in corn were major rent-reducing factors. Both allowed
for either the cultivation of more land and the production of a greater
output with the same capital, or for an actual reduction of land in culti-
vation and therefore capital accumulation in order to produce the same
output. The logical conclusion of any association between agricultural
improvements or freer trade and lower rents was that landlords would be
against all such changes. The polemical implications Ricardo drew from
this finding were, however, unacceptable to many of his contemporaries.
Malthus, in particular, continually disputed Ricardo's enmity to land-
lords. However, Ricardo never looked on the inverse relation between
rents and agricultural improvements as anything but a short-term
interim effect. Sraffa has argued that Ricardo merely added a footnote
in the third edition of his Principles conceding some ultimate benefit to
the landlord.[87] But even in his polemical chapters against Malthus and
the Corn Laws Ricardo had conceded that the landlord did have a
long-term interest in agricultural improvements : The machine which

produced the most important article of consumption would be improved,
and would be well paid for according as its services were demanded. All
the advantages would, in the first instance, be enjoyed by labourers,
capitalists, and consumers; but with the progress of population, they
would be gradually transferred to the proprietors of the soil.[338]

Ricardo most emphatically denied the charge of dissociating land-
lords from the gains of economic growth in his Notes on Malthus:

Perhaps in no part of his book has Mr. Malthus so much
mistaken me as on this subject - he represents me as supporting
the doctrine that the interests of landlords are constantly
opposed to those of every other class of the community, and one
would suppose from his language that I considered them as
enemies to the State.... All I meant to say of the landlord's
interest, was, that it would be for his advantage that the
machine which he had for producing corn should be in demand

            - that in fact his rent depended on it; - that on the contrary
it was the interest of the consumer to use the foreign machine,
if that would do the work cheaper. It is only in this case, that
the interests of the landlord and consumer really, if well under-
stood, come in contact. ... I have indeed observed that
improvements in agriculture were in their immediate effects
injurious to the landlord,... Great improvements in any
branch of production are in their first effects injurious to the
class who are engaged in that branch, but this is the statement
of a fact or an opinion, and cannot be supposed to cast any
injurious reflections.[89]

Ricardo, therefore, associated rising rents with the general tendency
of capital accumulation, but with the proviso that this abstracted from
technical change. The initial impact of technical change in agriculture,
ceteris paribus, was to reduce rents. However, Ricardo went on to
suggest that in a prosperous improving economy the advantages of
technical progress might be enjoyed first by labourers, capitalists, and
consumers, but they would soon also be enjoyed by landlords. Here he
brought the population principle to bear, for an economy would only
continue to improve because of constantly increasing demands created
either by an expanding population or by new needs. Where cultivation
was extended in spite of improvements, which was a likely situation in

-----

a growing economy, then rents too might rise.[40] Ricardo drew a
distinction in this, as in other cases, between the results of his restrictive
model, and his conception of the overall growth process.

_Technical change: mechanisms and processes_
I have shown that Ricardo's model of distribution gave remarkable
illumination to the significance he attached to technical change. His
model, which demonstrated the eventuality of the stationary state but
for the social and economic effects of technical improvement and free
trade, was by no means a pessimistic one. On the contrary, it was a
highly systematic and very optimistic presentation of the extent of the
gains to be had through technological improvement and freer trade.
In addition to this, Ricardo also had a number of ideas about the
processes of technical change. Not formally integrated with a model of
economic growth, these have often been missed by commentators
sceptical of Ricardo's recognition of the importance of technical
improvement to the economy of his day.
The sceptics have generally pointed to several gaps in Ricardo's
perceptions of technical change. They claim that Ricardo did not take
up Smith's discussion of the division of labour, and that he did not make
clear the distinction between capital-saving and labour-saving tech-
niques. They further believe that his model did not have built into it
a concept of self-generating technical change as did Smith's, where the
division of labour was embodied in new techniques, or Marx's, where
the drive to technical change was incorporated in the tendency to the
rising organic composition of capital. However, these and other factors
were discussed by Ricardo, though not in any strictly systematic
fashion. He adapted the concept of the division of labour to his own
purposes. He drew attention to the structure of capital, and understood
the implications of the capital or labour intensities of various technolo-
gies. He investigated the ways in which the introduction of machinery
saved on capital, and explored the extent of choice available in the
introduction of new techniques. He examined the progressive potentials
in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, and assessed the types
and relative merits of technological improvement in both. Finally, he
looked at inducements to gains in labour productivity and also gave a
place to the role of good government in promoting improvements.
Ricardo did not attempt to develop in more detail Smith's concept

**40 Ibid. p. 159.**


-----

of the technical division of labour and it is likely that he simply took it
for granted. What he did do, however, was to adapt the concept to his
own purposes, to help to explain the gains from international special-
isation in production. He gave much more detailed attention to the
structure of capital and extended this to the relative capital- and
labour-intensities of various techniques. He defined quite early on in his
work his notion of capital, and the criteria for its separation into its
fixed and circulating elements. Capital was generally defined as time
and was fixed or circulating according to its durability or the time it took
to consume. But, as Ricardo noted, the division was one 'not essential,
and in which the line of demarcation cannot be accurately drawn'.[41]

As he was to point out later, however, the division was actually very
important. The employment impact of capital accumulation was a
function of the proportions embodied in fixed and circulating elements.
I will discuss this in greater detail in the final section of this chapter on
machinery and labour.
Ricardo went on from this analysis of the structure of capital to
argue that the introduction of machinery could in part be explained
by the existing composition of capital. To explain this he deployed his
limiting assumptions of rising rates of population growth and diminish-
ing returns to explain a tendency towards rising proportions of
machinery to labour over time. Rising rates of population growth and
diminishing returns, even if seen as limits on economic expansion in
only the last analysis, might still seem to threaten the unimpeded course
of future economic growth. As threats they made the drive to overcome
economic necessity one of the major inducements to technical change.
Technical change was thus seen as a response to the pressure of a distant
tendency to rising rates of wages in old and wealthy nations. Using
these assumptions, Ricardo first analysed the inducements to and effects
of capital saving techniques. The introduction of machinery or the
increase in fixed capital could save on total capital, for he regarded
machinery as the product of less labour than that which it displaced.
A rise in wages would also have a greater effect on the value of com-
modities produced by circulating capital than on those produced by
fixed capital: 'Through their [machines'] influence an increase in the
price of provisions which raises wages, will affect fewer persons . . .
and the saving which is the consequence shows itself in the reduced
price of the commodities manufactured.' The introduction of this fixed
capital saved on total capital. Thus, 'neither machines, nor the com-

modities made by them rise in real value, but all commodities made by
machines fall, and fall in proportion to their durability'.[42]

Second, this peculiar effect of the introduction of machinery, as
well as the influence of differing comparative capital structures, were
issues which led Ricardo to take up discussion of the choice of techni-
ques. He pointed out the impact of factor prices such as the rates of
wages and interest on the introduction of new technologies.[43] Ricardo
connected the tendency of wages to rise relative to interest rates to a
tendency to rising capital intensity in industry. Thus he argued:

In the distribution of employments amongst all countries, the
capital of poorer nations will be naturally employed in those
pursuits, wherein a great quantity of labour is supported at
home, because in such countries the food and necessaries for
an increasing population can be most easily procured. In rich
countries, on the contrary, where food is dear, capital will
naturally flow, when trade is free, into those occupations
wherein the least quantity of labour is required to be main-
tained at home.[44]

Moreover, in the process of economic growth without substantial
innovation there was an increasing tendency for wage shares to rise and
'with every rise in the price of labour, new temptations are offered to
the use of machines'.[45] It was with this in mind that Ricardo came to
find acceptable John Barton's argument that 'as arts are cultivated, and
civilization is extended, fixed capital bears a larger and larger proportion
to circulating capital'.[46] Ricardian theory contained the embryonic
prediction of the fully mechanised economy.
Yet, factor prices were also the major determinants of the slow
diffusion of technical innovation. Ricardo explained the slow diffusion
of new techniques by low relative wages. It is thus that we understand
his image of the American economy as a relatively labour-intensive
economy. The choice of techniques was, in Ricardo's words, 'the

42 Ibid. p. 42.

separate this term, which was Hayek's conception from Ricardo's view
of the problem. T h e two have been distinguished by G. E. Ferguson,

constant competition' of 'machinery and labour[5].[47 c]We here see why it
is that old countries are constantly impelled to employ machinery, and
new countries to employ labour. With every difficulty of providing for
the maintenance of men, labour necessarily rises, and with every rise
in the price of labour, new temptations are offered to the use of
machinery.[348] In such old countries, among which he included Britain,
Ricardo recognised that technical change rather than simple capital
accumulation was the faster and more painless road to economic
growth.[49]

Ricardo's analysis of the choice of techniques became more refined
as he pushed on to examine the differing potentials for technological
improvement in agriculture and manufacturing. He generalised that in
the course of economic growth manufacturing would come to assume
larger proportions of the national economy. In a speech in 1822 he
declared:

The hon. gentleman might, perhaps, think that a manufactur-
ing country could not be so happy as an agricultural country.
But he might as well complain of a man's growing old as of
such a change in our national condition. Nations grow old as
well as individuals; and in proportion as they grow old,
populous and wealthy must they become manuf acturers. If
things were allowed to take their own course, we should un-
doubtedly become a great manufacturing country, but we
should remain a great agricultural country also.[50]

He was also sensitive to the fine divisions and types of change in
techniques which were particular to each sector. He did not regard
agricultural improvements as just another variation on improvements
in the manufacturing sector, for he identified two types of improvement
in the agricultural sector each of which had very different implications.
One type of improvement added to soil fertility by better crop rotation
or the use of fertilisers; this land-saving innovation reduced real rents.
The second type of improvement raised capital and labour productivity,
but the effectiveness of this capital-saving improvement was limited by
physical diminishing returns.
The analysis of improvement in the agricultural sector clarified

_The_

Ricardo's choice of the key dynamic factors in growth. It was, further-
more, the style of improvement in this key sector which was funda-
mental to the rate of capital accumulation. This rate depended in the
first instance on labour productivity and the fertility of the soil. Ricardo
agreed with Smith that in new settlements 'where the arts and
knowledge of countries far advanced in refinements are introduced[5],
the rate of capital accumulation exceeded the rate of population
growth.[51] Labour productivity, however, was equally dependent on
capital formation, and Ricardo therefore reproved Malthus for com-
paring the labour productivity of various nations on the basis of the
inclination to work. Such criteria completely neglected relative levels
of capital formation.[52]

Labour productivity, as I noted earlier, was central to Smith's
conception of the growth process. It is popularly believed that, in
contrast with Smith, Ricardo was so entrenched in a model based on the
accumulation of capital that he ignored the significance of labour
productivity. Here one can see, however, that Ricardo carried over the
spirit of Smith's ideas by seeing labour productivity along with the
fertility of the soil as factors affecting the rate of capital accumulation.
Ricardo not only sought to explain national differences in labour
productivity, but also to dissect this productivity by inquiring into skill.
Labour productivity depended on comparative levels of skill, which in
turn were related to comparative levels of capital formation. Ricardo,
unlike Smith, did not regard skill as an attribute given by the division
of labour. Skill was instead a capital good, provided by the labourer.
Skill was 'dependent on the interests fathers may feel to give their
children this dexterity and ingenuity', and the supply of such labour
depended on the costs of conferring this dexterity.[53] The subsistence of
labour now was regarded as providing not only for the continuity of
the day-to-day labour of a worker and his descendants, but for the
production of more and more complex and skilled labour.
Finally, Ricardo also conceived a definite role for good government
in the direction of capital accumulation and growth. Again, like Smith,
he distinguished badly governed from well-governed nations.

In those countries where there is abundance of fertile land,
but where, from the ignorance, indolence, and barbarism of
the inhabitants, they are exposed to all the evils of want and

**68 Ibid. p. 226.**


-----

famine, and where it has been said that population presses
against the means of subsistence, a very different remedy should
be applied from that which is necessary in long settled countries,
where, from the diminishing rate of the supply of raw produce,
all the evils of a crowded population are experienced. In the
one case, the evil proceeds from bad government, from the
insecurity of property, and from a want of education in all
ranks of the people. To be made happier they require only to
be better governed and instructed, as the augmentation of
capital, beyond the augmentation of people, would be the
inevitable result. No increase in the population can be too great,
as the powers of production are still greater.[54]

The transfer to good government in such a country would involve
higher rates of capital accumulation benefiting all.[55]

Ricardo's comments on the government of nations did not stop with
this judgement on the problems of young nations. For he also believed
that government had a great deal to do with the difficulties of old
nations, notably England. In arguing that older nations would tend
to become manufacturing nations, he had taken care to add, 'If things
were allowed to take their course, we should undoubtedly become a
great manufacturing country, but we should remain a great agricultural
country too.' In this speech Ricardo was not only making the point that
the rising dominance of the manufacturing sector was inevitable for
the British economy - he was arguing that it was desirable. The impli-
cation was that things were not being 'allowed to take their course'
because they were being held back by government. Ricardo was issuing
his warning to policy makers that a nation which expanded its capital
and its population without the benefit of international trade and techni-
cal improvement would soon find itself on the road to falling rates of
profit and an imminent stationary state.
Furthermore, Ricardo was not just preaching to a society still domin-
ated by the landed interests; he was preaching to a government which
was equivocal if not hostile to the current rapid progress of industriali-
sation. I would argue that Ricardo was deploying his economic analysis
not to represent the manufacturing as opposed to the landed classes but
to replace a dominant ideology of economic policy. His analysis of a
progressive continuously transforming economy was in stark contrast

to the assumptions of a static self-regulating economy then underlying
government policy.
Boyd Hilton in Corn, Cash, Commerce has demonstrated that the
so-called liberal Tory governments of 1815 to 1830 dominated by Lord
Liverpool and Huskisson were not particularly concerned for the
expansion of industry and commerce. They sought to feed and to
employ a rapidly expanding population, but saw themslves doing so
within a finite international economy currently under the strain not of
industrialisation but of the consequences of war and monetary
depreciation.
Industrialisation could not be accommodated within the terms of
debate known by these policy makers. When they decided on the return
to the gold standard in 1819 it was interpreted as a restoration of the
currency to its pre-war or 'natural' state. The policies of the liberal
Tories were inspired, as Boyd Hilton has expressed it, not by a belief in
utilitarianism but in 'naturalness'. Though they recognised that the
economy must not be allowed to retrogress, they also maintained that
growth must be confined to 'legitimate bounds'. For 'overstepping the
natural level of economic activity would cause overproduction and
gluts'.[56]

Ricardo's model of 'natural tendencies' which so incisively traced out
the connections between natural prices, laws of nature and natural
tendencies of rates of profit to fall, seemed eminently suited to analysing
an economic policy which assumed legitimate levels of economic activity
and natural states for the economy. Ricardo's strict model of income
distribution was a negative model in the sense that its purpose was to
demonstrate the importance of trade and technical progress by analysing
an economy which lacked these. However, it was also a model which can
be seen as effectively encapsulating the basic assumptions of the current
economic policy, and proceeding to analyse the dire and gloomy
prospects of continuing on the basis of a belief in legitimate and natural
paths to stability.
These governments did introduce a number of free trade reforms and
often justified these by referring to political economy. But such
justifications were in the main opportunistic. Boyd Hilton shows how in
agricultural trade policy their main interest was in the best guarantee of
subsistence, and they endorsed protection, then free trade accordingly.
I will outline in Chapter 9, 'The Export of Machinery', the extent to

-----

which their industrial trade policy was also based on expediency and
not theory. Ricardo cannot be neatly summed up as one who provided
a theory which was obviously influential to a willing government
carrying forward the interests of the rising manufacturing classes.
Ricardo's Principles put forward a new ideology of economic and tech-
nological improvement - if not of limitless growth, then of growth to
which an empirical limit could not yet be set. But he was a missionary
in a land of pagan naturalists.

_Machinery and labour_
Ricardo's interest in the connections between a country's capital
structure and its technology did not at first go any further than a few
remarks on inter-country comparisons of economic development and
explanations for existing techniques and trade patterns. However, he
soon came to realise that the composition of capital in a country, and
through this its choice of a suitable technology, could have important
implications for employment. His chapter on machinery, the only
significant change in the third edition of his Principles, detailed his
recognition of the employment impact of a change in techniques.
Ricardo's change of view did not have purely theoretical implications,
for the problem could not be separated from the contemporary debate
on machinery and labour.
This chapter represented a fascinating and provocative development
in Ricardo's economic theory, and the findings he described there
seemed to be at variance with the optimistic perspectives he offered on
technology throughout the rest of the book. Furthermore, its claims
appeared to be so directly addressed to a central issue of public debate,
that theory and politics must have been closely entwined. In this one
small section of the Principles Ricardo presented his readers with the
political economy of radicalism, reaction, and liberalism of his own time.
It is a chapter which can only be understood through a historical
interpretation, for it touched on a contemporary issue which was far-
reaching in its social significance.
When Ricardo publicly announced the change he had made in his
opinions on machinery he said that though he had not published any-
thing on the subject, 'yet I have in other ways given my support to
doctrines which I now think erroneous'.[57] This probably referred to the
part he took in the anti-Owenite campaign about which I will say more
below. However, Ricardo had also referred to labour-saving machinery
**" ibid. p. 386.**


-----

explicity in his Essay on Profits where he argued that the impact of
a low price of corn on the working classes 'would be nearly the same as
the effects of improved machinery, which it is now no longer questioned,
has a decided tendency to raise the real wages of labour'.[58] In the first
edition of the Principles Ricardo had taken this for granted, and only
recognised capital transfer costs. It is also true that even when something
other than an Owenite argument for technological unemployment was
put to him, Ricardo was similarly unimpressed. Ricardo's early reaction
to John Barton, whose work he came later to endorse, bears this out. In
answer to Barton, Ricardo simply asserted that the accumulation of
fixed capital would not have any adverse impact on employment. The
quantity produced over and above necessary consumption would be
the same in both cases. Moreover, he regarded the possibility of techno-
logical unemployment as highly unlikely: 'The case is evidently put
for the sake of argument, and could not really take place, for there is no
new creation of machinery which entirely supersedes the use of the
labour of man. A steam engine requires the constant labour of man -
he must regulate its motion and velocity - he must procure coals for the
fire necessary to work it - he must attend to its annual repairs.'[59]

Ricardo repeated his general reaction when he commented on
McCulloch's partial endorsement of Barton's theory of technical
change.[80]

Ricardo's change of mind, as embodied in the third edition of his
_Principles, took place when he came to consider not simply the effect_
of technical change in a situation of gradual and balanced growth but
also the case where a change in techniques involved a strong switch to
fixed capital. He discovered that where the introduction of such new
technology took place in a situation of capital scarcity there would
probably have to be a change in the composition of a country's capital
stock. A country's stock of circulating capital would have to be reduced
in order to raise a stock of fixed capital sufficient to introduce the new
technique. But its level of employment was dependent upon its circulat-
ing capital, that is its wage goods and materials. If capital was shifted
from the production of wage goods to the construction of machinery,
then employment over the whole economy would have to fall. There
were several implications of such a change in the composition of capital
during the construction period of new machinery. The first was that

final output could actually fall during this period, as wage goods were
definitely a part of the final output. The second was that the whole
stock of capital could actually rise at the same time that circulating
capital and final output were falling. For, though circulating capital
was being transferred to the construction of fixed capital, the new
machines could add to the capital stock by more than the reduction in
circulating capital. Finally, inventions could be labour saving, not for
any one industry or sector, but for the economy as a whole. During a
construction phase total employment could actually fall because of the
decline of circulating capital and final output both of which would
reduce the demand for labour. However, as Ricardo emphasised just
as strongly, these eventualities were only possible during a time of
construction and rapid accumulation of fixed capital. As soon as the new
machine came into operation such high costs of accumulation would
be compensated by the lower labour or 'circulating capital' input
required in running the new machines. This would seem at first sight
only to add to the level of unemployment. But it was not so. For the
fact that labour was displaced from the sector using the new machines
would lead to lower costs of production, and therefore create a surplus
which would in turn create the means for re-employing labour in other
sectors.
Ricardo did not believe that technological unemployment must be
the necessary result of any change in techniques in a particular industry.
It did not occur because a machine replaced a labourer, but rather,
because investment in machinery had to claim priority over the pro-
duction of final output. Technological unemployment would therefore
only take place in those extreme situations where a country's capital
was very scarce and where the construction of the new machines
demanded a strong switch to fixed capital. Ricardo's analysis was an
original one, distinct from the case made by many of his contempor-
aries. Where others maintained merely that machines displaced labour
in any industry where they were introduced, Ricardo claimed that the
replacement of men by machines in particular industries need not
extend any further. In fact, the displacement of labour in one industry,
by increasing productivity, might compensate for a form of techno-
logical unemployment which arose from the quite different causes of
capital scarcity and sudden changes in the composition of capital. The
lower labour or circulating capital input required in the operation of
the new machines in any one sector would generate a surplus to re-
employ labour in other sectors. The new machines or fixed capital


-----

stock, once accumulated, would generate gains in productivity and
therefore increase the surplus. Rising rates of growth would release
the strains on saving in the original capital scarce economy, and would
ultimately result in higher levels of capital and a rising demand for
labour. Ricardo confined the time of difficulty to the period of
accumulation prior to the full operation of the new machines. The
crucial problem lay in the possibilities of labour-saving effect which
extended over the economy as a whole - that is, an interim period when
capitalists expected to invest in machinery, and to gain themselves the
same return, yet to produce for a time a smaller final output. After this
interim period there ought to be no further restriction of this nature on
the demand for labour.[61]

Ricardo himself emphasised that he was analysing a relatively
restricted case, and warned his readers not to make the inference that
machinery should be discouraged. These results applied only to the
situation where machinery was suddenly discovered and extensively
introduced. Generally, discoveries were more gradual, and, rather than
diverting capital from another sector, they encouraged a higher rate of
saving.[62]

Ricardo's discovery that technical change could result simultaneously
in a rise in net income or total surplus, and in a decline in gross income
or total output, did not, however, disturb his general theory of capital
accumulation. Prior to this discovery he had analysed the sources of
capital accumulation in terms of the distinction between gross and net
revenue. He had disputed Smith's view that the power of any country
was to be assessed in proportion to the value of its annual product,
because this was the fund from which taxes were ultimately paid.
Ricardo separated himself from this view and argued that taxes and
savings could only be derived from rent and profits, that is, from net
revenue and not from gross revenue. He saw no reason for supporting
Smith's preference for agricultural investment. This preference was

based on what Ricardo regarded as the misguided view that agricultural
investment created the greatest annual product because it gave motion
to the greatest amount of 'industry', that is, productive labour. Ricardo
added a footnote in the third edition of his Principles denying Say's
charge that he 'considered as nothing, the happiness of so many human
beings',[63] in other words, that he ignored the employment-generating
characteristics of particular industries.
Ricardo's discovery was completely compatible with his previous
analysis of the mechanisms of accumulation. The rate of accumulation
was dependent on net revenue. The capitalist only had an interest in
maintaining his rate of profit, and therefore this net revenue. His total
product had no bearing on this. However, as Ricardo pointed out, the
'power of supporting a population' and the 'situation of the labouring
classes' depended on total product and not on the surplus,[64] and he
showed that the condition of the working classes was also dependent on
unproductive employment.

Independently of the consideration of the discovery and use
of machinery, to which our attention has been just directed,
the labouring classes have no small interest in the manner in
which the net income of the country is expended... As the
labourers, then, are interested in the demand for labour, they
must naturally desire that as much of the revenue as possible
should be diverted from expenditure on luxuries, to be
expended in the support of menial servants.[65]

The chapter on machinery has created major difficulties for historians
of economic thought who have wondered about Ricardo's own assess-
ment of its significance. They have been even more puzzled by its
apparent contradiction with the rest of Ricardo's model. Most historians
of thought have seen it as something of a quirk. Pasinetti has argued that
the introduction of machinery violated the assumptions of Ricardo's
model: the chapter may perhaps not have been a contradiction but
was 'an honest acknowledgement' by Ricardo 'of the limits of his own
theory'.[66] Blaug argues that Ricardo had hidden motives for not carry-
ing through with the analysis of labour-saving technical change, 'to
have done so would have vitiated the simple model which he had con-

strutted to convey the undesirable consequences of the corn laws'.[87] Fin-
ally Hollander argues that Ricardo's failure to examine his model in the
light of his new chapter simply reflected his adherence to the methodo-
logical position that the realism of the assumptions was of less signifi-
cance than the predictions derived from them.[68] Hollander has argued
more recently that Ricardo's change of position was not really as
significant as he had imagined - that the raw materials for the new
theory were implicit in the first edition of his work.[69]

All these views of Ricardo simply deny his own perception of the
chapter. An analysis of ideas which dismisses the very point a thinker
insists he is making is very unsatisfactory history. We can learn more
about the significance and implications which Ricardo attached to this
chapter if we look at contemporary reactions and his own defences.
The chapter was of obvious importance to the current machinery
debates, the debates on technical change and unemployment which
pervaded most of this period of the Industrial Revolution. Ricardo him-
self participated in discussions of Owenism, spade husbandry and the
plight of the handloom weavers. I will say more about this below, as
the whole issue became very important to subsequent debate. Ricardo's
early attitude both to Owen and schemes for the re-employment of the
weavers was quite disparaging. He regarded Owen as a visionary as
little deserving of attention as Tory fanatics such as Southey.[70] He was
scornful of Owen's hopes that community feeling would overcome self-
interest.
Ricardo's mind on this issue was not closed, however. He did become
involved in a committee of Owenite sympathisers to examine Owen's
plans, but Ricardo explicitly separated himself from any commitment
to the cause.[71] The most he would concede was what he stated in the
House of Commons: 'In a limited degree he thought the scheme likely
to succeed, and to produce, where it did succeed, considerable happi-
ness, comfort, and morality, by giving employment and instruction to
the lower classes . . . He could not, however, go along with him [Owen]

in the hope of ameliorating the condition of the lower classes to such a
degree as he seemed to expect.'[72] He saw himself purely as an economic
consultant on the committee. The committee, however, concluded in
generally favourable terms to Owen's views, and several critics soon
accused Ricardo of complicity in the heresy of Owenism. Trower
reported his own amazement at Ricardo's action.[78] Ricardo attempted
to exonerate himself by claiming he was not bound to approve the plans,
only to question them: 'Can any reasonable person believe, with Owen,
that a society, such as he projects, will flourish and produce more than
has ever yet been produced by an equal number of men, if they are to
be stimulated to exertion by a regard to the community, instead of by
a regard to their private interests? Is not the experience of ages against
him?'[74]

Similarly, Ricardo was not at all convinced by the early strategy of the
handloom weavers' lobby. John Maxwell presented the motion, which
was to recur throughout the 1820s and 1830s, that there be a tax on
the power loom to compensate for the tax on workers' consumption
goods. Ricardo regarded this as yet another restriction on trade, and
argued that it was, rather, the duty of government to provide incentives
for the development and not the restriction of industry.[75]

However, Ricardo seems to have expressed less opposition to the
Owenite schemes for spade husbandry. He consistently disclaimed any
knowledge of agricultural techniques, but saw no reason why the scheme
would not work. As he stated in the House of Commons, Tor what did
the country want at the present moment? A demand for labour. If
the facts stated of spade husbandry were true, it was a beneficial course,
as affording that demand,' He separated this scheme from other aspects
of Owenism: 'a division of the country into parallelograms, or an
establishment of a community of goods, and similar visionary schemes'.
Ricardo went so far as to urge that the government circulate 'useful
information', and supported the appointment of a committee to look
into the matter.[76]

Just as Ricardo, prior to his rethinking of the machinery and labour
question, played an active part in contemporary discussions, so he con-
tinued to do so after publication of his chapter, and even there he
recognised the political implications of his logic and wrote, 'That the
opinion entertained by the labouring class, that the employment of
machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on
prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of
political economy.[577] Ricardo, moreover, reaffirmed these views in a
speech in the House of Commons by criticising a potentially 'useful'
popular pamphlet against machine breaking by Gobbett. Here and in his
correspondence, Ricardo now dissociated himself from the popular
middle-class dogma on machinery. He stood up to McCulloch's wrath
that he had given authority to 'all those who raise a yell against the
extension of machinery', and that by his word, 'the laws against the
Luddites are a disgrace to the Statute Book[5].[78] Malthus also objected
to the implications of what Ricardo had to say - that his views were
'Liable to be taken fast hold of by the labouring classes[5].[79] Ricardo,
undaunted, pressed consideration of the question through the Political
Economy Club. After two delays it was finally discussed in February
1822. But Ricardo was left disappointed in the reception of his views,
'I could hardly satisfy myself of the general opinion on that disputed
point.[580] Ricardo also continued to stress the importance of his new

position, particularly by criticising the popular political economy of
his supporters. He drew repeated attention to this in his notes on
McCulloch's lecture. At three different points in his criticisms he
objected to McCulloch's persistently stated views that the demand for
labour was a function of the accumulation of capital and that the
interests of masters and workmen were always harmonious.[81] Ricardo
placed similar weight on the point in his criticism of James Mill's
popular work, Elements of Political Economy.
Ricardo's unequivocal faith in his stand did not, however, encourage
him to change his practice and to recommend any change in policy
towards machinery. He concluded his chapter by arguing that nothing
should be done to discourage technical innovation for fear of capital
export. If the use of machinery led to higher returns, capital would
flow to the country which encouraged technical change : 'By investing
part of a capital in improved machinery, there will be a diminution in
the progressive demand for labour; by exporting it to another country,
the demand will be wholly annihilated.'[82]

The critical reaction to Ricardo's chapter was primarily a doctrinal
and empirical one. Most complained that the case he had set up was
a very peculiar one. Few inquired into the analytical implications of the
chapter. Malthus was one of these few who complained that he had
not 'considered all the bearings of your concession on the other parts
of your work'.[83] Ricardo did not take up this challenge. The reasons for
this were most likely not those given by Hollander, Blaug and Pasinetti.
Rather, it would simply not have worried Ricardo that the assumptions
of the new chapter did not fit his model, for, as I have shown, this was
a highly specific tool set up to show the consequences of hindrances to
technical change and foreign trade. The difficulty posed by his new
discovery was that it tempered only the positive force of his policy
proposals on technical change.
Ricardo's faith in the gains from trade, science, and technology was
not left completely unassailed. His chapter on machinery was testimony
to that. But few historians have drawn attention to his general optimism
otherwise. Even the threat of the stationary state was an unreal one.
Not only did the stationary state have no bearing on the immediate
future, but the tendency of profits to fall in Ricardo's counterfactual
model would be constantly checked in the real world by improvements in

science and technology. 'Man from youth grows to manhood, then
decays and dies; but this is not the progress of nations', for they could
'continue for ages, to sustain undiminished their wealth, and their
population'.[84]

The historian need no longer contrast the rapid technical change
of the Industrial Revolution with the pessimism and gloom of classical
economics. Ricardo's model of distribution and accumulation was an
analytical tool moulded to clarify the primary importance of technical
change and foreign trade. This purpose becomes obvious once we go
beyond the confines of Ricardo's analytical model to what he actually
said about the processes and impact of technical change. His purpose
was misunderstood by most of his contemporary critics and supporters.
But Ricardo none the less dominated early nineteenth-century dis-
cussion of the machinery question. His critics based their own contri-
butions on an analysis of technology. They began from a criticism of
Ricardo's strict model, yet in so far as they had neglected his wider
discussion, they often returned in the end to Ricardo.

##### Political economy and the division of labour

Ricardo's novel analysis of the machinery issue provoked not only his
critics but his closest followers. The latter were often more interested
in the practical implications of the conclusion of his chapter on machin-
ery than they were in the novelty of the theoretical analysis. The
chapter on machinery obviously opened deep social concerns among
Ricardo's contemporaries. His new ideas rankled, for they sharpened a
source of contention already apparent in working-class dissent from
industrialisation. Owenism and anti-machinery riots had by now become
very real bogies for the optimists of early nineteenth-century industrial
capitalism. In the years following Ricardo's death much of the new
work in political economy which addressed itself to the future economic
prospects of Britain projected a certain polemical tone. It was a
polemic incorporated in a purposive inquiry into the universal benefits
of industrialisation. Political economists conducted their inquiries into
the benefits of industrialisation against the background of both the
theoretical heritage of Smith and Ricardo and the practical issues of
crisis and depression, Owenite radicalism, and resistance to machinery
that flared up in the anti-machinery riots of 1826. It was the response to
Ricardo's legacy plus such pressing issues of economic policy which
made political economy a discordant though exploratory discipline in
the 1820s.
Economists after Ricardo faced many difficulties in coming to terms
with his Principles which even in his own time was an intellectual tour
dc force. Not least among these difficulties was the problem of under-
standing the status of and the relationship between his twin interests in


-----

the analysis of the falling rate of profit and the optimistic growth
prospects of Western economies. Equally, problems of crises, gluts and
machinery were constantly in the air on the level both of practical
politics and of general theory. The recovery from the post-Napoleonic
depression, the confrontation with Owenite socialism, and the 1826
anti-machinery riots only pinpointed more general phenomena, pressed
political economy into local and political life, and redirected and
influenced future developments in theory.
This was a period when class connotations were not the clear ones
of master versus workman. Radical and reactionary visions were often
similar, and 'honourable' masters often joined forces with insurrection-
ary artisans. The optimism behind the advance of the Industrial
Revolution was not complacent. It was established in struggle against
both those who looked to some alternative pattern of development and
those who sought control over the directions of technology. The heroic
dream of technological inevitability met 'with a formidable opposition
which deployed Malthus and some gentry followers with Sismondi,
Owen, the radical weavers, and the small masters. This was, further-
more, only the most articulate form of dissent. Technological innova-
tion was challenged in everyday struggle in the workplaces of most
industries throughout this period. Workers and their trade unions were
not ashamed to denounce the type of progress which brought
redundancy and few aids to mobility, and which enforced higher labour
productivity with inadequate compensation. Such central difficulties
of policy and social conflict moulded political economy in the 1820s
into a practical science in as important a sense as Ricardo's legacy had
stamped it as a theoretical discipline. Both the institutional context of
the discipline of political economy and these practical and theoretical
issues characterised this period as one of a wealth of dissident literature.
This was not, as has often been believed, a period of the unequivocal
ascendance of classical or Ricardian economics. Pressing practical
problems and a real intellectual struggle with Ricardo's ideas prevented
this.
Several of the economists of the period were genuinely involved in
the development and diffusion of Ricardo's ideas, in particular
McCulloch, Ellis, and James and John Stuart Mill. Ricardo's allies
gave great publicity to the significance of the Ricardian achievement.
James Mill and J. R. McCulloch both dwelt on the scientific character
of Ricardian economics, and attempted to turn political economy into
a fixed body of doctrine. McGulloch's Principles combined outright


-----

plagiarism of his master with an evangelism on the behalf of industry.[1]

James Mill's Elements of Political Economy presented economics as a
dogma - a theory with no qualifications.[2] The early writings of John
Stuart Mill in these years were also notably polemical, and he later
referred to them as 'mere reproductions'.[3] Another of the Ricardians,
William Ellis, was also a man of practical and doctrinal concerns. He
was a member of Mill's Utilitarian Society, and, though described as
'an original thinker in the field of political economy',[4] he himself
recognised his real interests:

In those discussions which we used to hold, the difference
between John Mill and me was brought out very often. He was
for enquiring into everything, and going to the bottom of
everybody's theories and ideas; I cared only for the practical
value of political economy and did not want to think deeply on
points which could have no bearing on social affairs and human
conduct.[5]

Ellis expressed these practical concerns in the main pieces he wrote
for the Westminster Review: 'Charitable Institutions' (1824),
'Exportation of Machinery' (1825)[ an<]^ 'Effect of the Employment of
Machinery on the Happiness of the Working Classes' (182 6).
These followers of Ricardo were challenged by a series of critics.
Dissent, with intent to develop new theories, characterised the work of
Robert Torrens on value and technical progress, of Thomas Hopkins
on rent, and of a range of anonymous writers on the impact of increases
in labour productivity.[6] These critics were complemented by the under-

consumptionists Thomas Chalmers, T. R. Malthus, and Simon Gray.[7]

British economists of the period also paid significant attention to the
work of two foreign critics: J. C. L. Simonde de Sismondi and J. B.
Say. Sismondi and Malthus were frequent correspondents, and Ricardo,
though not impressed with Sismondi's political economy, did hold him
in generally high regard.[8] J. B. Say was an honorary member of the
Political Economy Club, and was also known for his notes on the French
translation of Ricardo. He corresponded frequently with Ricardo and
was one of his most consistent critics on value. Say had also worked in
England for a time as the manager of an insurance firm, followed by a
period as one of Napoleon's industrial informants, reporting on English
factories and techniques.[9]

The political economy of the 1820s, in confronting the economic and
social issues of rapid industrialisation, took on a form distinct from that
of later decades. As far as generalisation is possible, it does seem that
certain assumptions and concepts influenced the way in which particular

problems such as the machinery issue were discussed. Investigation of
ideas on technology among the political economists of the 1820s seems
to indicate a frame of reference dominated by the division of labour.
But economists of the time were also coming to give greater consider-
ation to the predominance of the machine and the form taken on by
capital.
These followers and critics of Ricardo, however great may have been
their differences on theories of value, economic fluctuations and
distribution,[10] maintained an underlying consensus on the role of labour
and its technical attributes. This interest formed the background for
debate on productive and unproductive labour, and on the determinants
and effects of population growth. Most economists of the 1820s
subscribed to the broad categories of productive labour described in
Patrick Golquhoun's Wealth, Power and Resources of the British
_Empire (1814). Colquhoun described as productive all labourers in_
trade, manufacturing and agriculture who in some way added to wealth.
Unproductive labourers added to the value of nothing, though many
of them might be useful.[11] Economists assumed that growth was
generated by shifting resources from unproductive to productive sectors.
Growth was founded not just on the optimal allocation of capital,
however, but on the level of productivity within the 'productive[5] sectors.
It was here that economists concentrated their interests in the technical
attributes of labour. They argued that higher productivity was related
to the incentives of high wages and the intensification of labour. The
pace, discipline and skill with which work was done were the keys to
higher productivity and a nationally superior technology. The evidence
for these ideas grew out of the sensitive work done by several political
economists of the time on the determination of wages and labour supply,
in other words, the population question.
The following section of this chapter will set out the manner in which
labour, the division of labour, and wages and population were discussed

in order to set out the theoretical framework into which the analysis
of machinery was integrated. The final two sections of the chapter will
then analyse the role given to industry, machinery and economic crises
in a set of theories in which the division of labour was chosen as the
primary dynamic factor of industrialisation.

_Wages and population_
The attention given to the role of labour and the possibilities of increas-
ing productivity through the better organisation and intensification of
work, and through the incentives of higher wages, made it natural for
economists to dissent from the Malthusian population doctrine. There
was a wave of revulsion against the doctrine, not only among radical
and tory romantic critics, but among established political economists.
Malthus's own adamant defence of his doctrine was probably reinforced
by his fears of the urban horde: 'Late events must make us contemplate
with no small alarm a great increase in the proportion of our manu-
facturing population, both with reference to the happiness, and to the
liberty of our country.'[12]

But although such fears were certainly widespread, they were not
considered acceptable as reasons for a blind faith in Malthusianism.
Writers of the period showed more interest in the actual material
constitution of labour as distinct from its purely abstract conception as
a perfectly mobile factor of production. Thus Sismondi, a constant
critic of 'crude Malthusian tendencies', hailed the empirical work of
John Barton on population movements. Barton's close statistical work
showed that there was no clear evidence that wage rates had any direct
influence on birth and death rates or labour supply. Those who refused
to promote higher wages on the grounds of fears of population increase
and excess labour supplies argued on false premises. For, as Barton had
argued, the motivation of the labourer was determined by 'custom'
rather than by abstract reasoning about quantitative estimates of wage
movements. If any factor was important to the timing of marriage aside
from custom, it was not wage levels but employment prospects. Barton,
moreover, accounted for the recent rise in population, not by factors
influencing the birth rate, but by reductions in the death rate brought
about by the completely exogenous factor of better health and medicine.
The idea that lower death rates and not higher birth rates were at the
basis of the contemporary population boom complemented Barton's
views on the supply of labour. For he had shattered the accepted identity

between population and labour supply. He made the obvious point,
but one that needed to be made in criticism of Malthus, that an increase
in the birth rate did not automatically mean an increase in labour
supply. An increase in wages would have no immediate impact on
labour supply because the creation of an adult labourer was a long-
term process. Between an increase in population and an increase in the
active labour force lay long years of maturing, socialising, skill acquire-
ment, and apprenticeship.[18]

Several main-line theorists such as Ricardo, Torrens and Senior were
already sensitive to the role of custom and the social determinants of
subsistence levels.[14] Soon even McCulloch, after reading Barton, was
moved to reject Malthusianism, and went so far as to argue that
population pressure was necessary to growth.[15]

Though Malthus believed there would be a tendency to low real
wages because of population growth, his attitudes to policies for low
wages were, however, quite different. Both Ricardo and Malthus, along
with most contemporary writers on political economy, condemned the
cry of manufacturers and merchants for low wages.[18] Most agreed that
high wages were conducive to high productivity. McCulloch in his
earlier writing, before he had come to accept Barton's criticisms,
depicted very well the character of this dual belief in high wages and in
the Malthusian population theory:

No country can flourish, if the necessary rate of wages be low;
nor can it long be depressed, if the rate of wages be high.
Labourers are the sinews of agriculture, of manufactures, of
commerce; it is by their labour that our machines are
constructed and set in motion; it is by their ingenuity, frugality,
and perseverance, that we have become what we are... so
long as the standard of REAL WAGES is high, and it is in
their power to keep it so, so long will the social fabric be stable.

But if the standard of REAL WAGES be permanently reduced,
and it must be their own fault if it be reduced, if by an
improvident increase of their number they be once brought to
place their dependence on... the mere necessaries of life,...
The spirit of industry by which they are so eminently
distinguished will be destroyed, and with it the morals, the
prosperity and the tranquillity of Britain.[17]

The apparently religious enthusiasm for high wages, and the crucial
role of labour depicted in the first part of this passage, were typical of
the style of mystical exultation of the role of labour in growth and
technological transformation : 'The world is the theatre of labour, and
labour is the origin of wealth, and the most certain and salutary
preventive of poverty, wretchedness and disaffection.[518] High wages
could produce a capital-intensive bias, or, as McCulloch put it, a
country with high wages and low profits would produce machine-made
goods much cheaper.[19] Such an analysis was indeed topical. It 'sets the
impolicy of the restrictions on the exportation of machinery used in
cotton-mills in a very striking point of view[5].[20]

The productivity of labour was increased by technical skill, 'the useful
arts[5], 'the faculty of labour'.[21] Indeed, wage levels reflected skill require-
ments. Theorists made the connection between the dilution of skill and
the new employment possibilities for women and children. One of these,
Thomas Hopkins, devised a scale of wage differentials ranging from
weaver to machine maker. Wages in weaving were low because of a
widening labour market. The trade demanded little skill as apprentice-
ship regulations broke down, and it offered remunerative employment

to women and children. Highest wages went to the fully-qualified
machine maker, because the trade restricted its labour market by offer-
ing little for the labour of learners during the long years of apprentice-
ship. Few could afford to put their children in such occupations with
only the expectation of eventual high returns.[22]

_The division of labour_
Associated with this search for the sources of higher labour productivity
went an interest in wider aspects of the division of labour. Smith
provided the point of reference. Torrens, first in The Economists Refuted
and again in his later work, reminded his readers of the dialectic worked
out by Smith between technique and market. The 'expectation of
exchanging gives rise to the division of labour'.[23] McCulIoch expressed
the same ideas in term of the 'facility of exchange' which acted as the
'vivifying principle of industry'. 'Like the different parts of a well
constructed machine, the inhabitants of a civilized country are all
mutually dependent on and connected with each other.'[24] Free trade
was a source of invention. It extended business, and it would 'diffuse a
greater, a more extensive, a more emulous, and a more successful spirit
of active industry'.[25]

Again, Smith's remarkable theories of the relationship between town
and country in Book III of the Wealth of Nations found their way into
Torrens's theories of inter-dependent growth in agriculture and in-
dustry.[26] The novel feature which Torrens did add was a distinction
between the mechanical and the territorial divisions of labour. To the
original mechanical division corresponded a vast regional and global
differentiation. The real measure of the gains from trade was the degree
to which territorial specialisation increased productivity.
McCulloch's national perspectives complemented Torrens's inter-
national ones, for he believed that Britain's future lay with the division
of labour, the invention of machinery and the development of manu-
facturing industry. Agriculture and industry might complement each

other in the international sphere, but in the national context he believed
it was only industrial progress which mattered. He dismissed all
compromises between industry and agriculture, and freely expressed how
much he detested the domestic system of industry: 'I consider the
combination of manufacturing and agricultural pursuits, to be proof of
the barbarism of every country in which it exists; and so far from its
being advantageous to the country, I think it decidedly the reverse.[527]

He was completely derisive of schemes to introduce a 'cottage economy'.
The great cause of the improvement of society was the division of
labour and this could not be properly introduced in such systems be-
cause few surplus goods were produced for exchange. In such systems
it would be impossible to 'realize capital'.[28] McCulloch looked to the
machine-making sector as well as the manufacturing sector as funda-
mental, even to the development of agriculture. He emphasised the
labour of the ploughwright, millwright, smith, and other artisans
preparing the tools of the farmer as manufacturing labour which was
crucial to agriculture.[29] The indefinite extension and improvement of
machinery were the companions of the continued and indefinite
improvement of the skill and industry of labour.[30]

Despite the great enthusiasm of theorists in this period for the
Mechanics Institutes, McCulloch was one of the few who explicitly
connected education with his theory of invention. He proposed that
there be a cordial reception for foreigners who brought technical im-
provements or skills with them,[31] and he saw the acquisition of talent
and skill as an actual capital investment. The entire success of the
cotton industry was to be attributed to the discoveries and inventions
of Hargreaves, Arkwright and Watt. McCulloch, however, added
another meaning to skill, and defined it as Smith had, as 'expertness in
manipulation and in the details of various processes [which] can only
be attained by slow degrees'. Skill was also defined, however, as
'industrious habits'.[32] This very significant addition to its meaning, as
the latter part of this book will demonstrate, also pervaded the

Mechanics Institutes Movement, for which McCulloch had great
hopes.[38]

Political economists drew immediate practical conclusions from their
ideas on the role of labour. Their assessments of the prospects of the
agricultural and manufacturing sectors were grounded on the optimistic
implications they drew from the division of labour.

_Land and agricultural improvement_
Britain's economic transformation did not raise questions simply about
industry and the towns. It created great concern over the prospects of
agriculture and the future of rural society. The landed classes sought
to protect themselves and to maintain a place for the country against
the encroachment of the city and the industrial middle class. They did
this by creating artificial barriers to the untrammelled aggrandisement
of industry — the Corn Laws — and Ricardo's persistent attack on these
laws led many to identify in his theories negative attitudes to the land.
In their attempts to discredit these theories, most of them, as I have
shown, simply misunderstood the logical framework of Ricardo's theory
of diminishing returns, and adopted an extreme interpretation of his
attitude to landlords.
Malthus and Chalmers may have had a gloomy vision of the tendency
to overpopulation and the general glut, but it was they, significantly,
who gave the greatest coverage to technical progress in agriculture.
Chalmers argued that agricultural labour became more efficient with
the intervention of tools of husbandry. It was 'not a matter of hunger
and necessity enforcing the cultivation of new regions, but of the
triumph of new energies and acquisitions seeking to subdue new territory
and get equal subsistence from it'.[34] Malthus believed that rising rents
required agricultural improvement, and conversely that improvements
would bring advantages to landlords on the renewal of leases. 'To the
honour of the Scotch cultivators it should be observed, that they have
applied their capitals so very skillfully and economically, that at the

**83 McCulloch, Principles, pp. 117, 118. Cf. Torrens, An Essay on the**

**_Economy of Nations : if a 'considerable industry' was 'superseded', the_**
**'faculty of labour remains to the workpeople, but their skill is eclipsed',**

-----

same time that they have prodigiously increased the produce, they have
increased the landlord's proportion of it.[535] Malthus also impressed
Ricardo with a perceptive comparison between the land and machinery.
He clearly distinguished the mechanisms of technical progress in
agriculture from those of industry : 'The great inequality in the powers
of the machinery employed in producing raw produce, forms one of the
most remarkable features which distinguishes the machinery of the land
from the machinery employed in manufactures . . . Every extensive
country may thus be considered as possessing a gradation of machines
for the production of corn and raw materials.'[36]

Malthus and Chalmers defended the prospect of a protected agri-
culture. Torrens did not. His optimism was based on the prospects of
agriculture in an open economy. Throughout the whole period he
defended the most forward-looking ideas on agricultural change. In the
second edition of his Essay an the External Corn Trade, he conceded
that agricultural protection would increase rents, but only temporarily.
Any cutback on profits caused by rising food prices would lead to the
export of capital and therefore limit expansion of the manufacturing
sector. This would stop local accumulation and progress, and would
ultimately have adverse repercussions on landowning interests. Torrens
also made the very 'adventurous' proposal that the import of foreign
corn, by making marginal corn production unprofitable, would raise
the profitability of producing luxury food products. Thus free trade and
economic progress could not but raise the landlord's income.[87]

At a surprisingly early period, Torrens also introduced the conception
of high farming. In disputing with Owen he argued :

If our improved machinery did not tend to reduce the expense
of producing manufactured goods, we could neither sell our
fabrics in the foreign market, nor keep our inferior lands under
cultivation... A reduction in the value of manufactured goods,
which allows lands of an inferior quality to be taken in, also

admits of the additional application of capital to our better
soil, and promotes that system of high farming for which
England is so conspicuous. Were it not for the application of
that scientific power and improved machinery, to which Mr.
Owen erroneously attributes our distress, the whole of our
foreign trade would be annihilated, and our tillage reduced one
half.[38] [my italics]

A few years later, Torrens spoke of high farming as synonymous with
heavy capital investment in the soil. If such farming was undertaken,
the cultivator had to be left with a reasonable return, so that during the
period of such investment the landlord would have to be satisfied with
lower rents.[39] Torrens also went as far as identifying farm size as a
possible source of technical innovation. Larger farms allowed for the
use of better agricultural machinery, such as threshing machines, and
for a larger marketed surplus, and could therefore pay a proportionately
higher rent. Landlords would be prompted to let their whole estate to
fewer farmers, which meant smaller farmers would sink to being
agricultural labourers: 'the employment of more efficacious machinery,
and the more economical application of labour, which are found ad-
missable into large concerns, and which enable the great farmer to tempt
the proprietor with the offer of a higher rent, would also enable him,
. . . to raise a greater produce than before.' Small farmers, though
reduced to farm labourers, would probably gain a greater subsistence
than previously.[40]

This fascination with the potentiality of technical progress in agri-
culture did not, however, convince the theorist who was later to become
the most influential. John Stuart Mill continued to believe, as an
empirical fact, that agricultural improvements could have no permanent
impact:

The improvements which have been introduced into agriculture
are so extremely limited, when compared with those of which
some branches of manufactures have been found susceptible;
and they are, besides, so very slow in making their way against
those old habits and prejudices, which are perhaps more deeply
rooted among the farmers than among any other class of

producers, that the progress of population seems in most
instances to have kept pace with the improvement of cultivation
... It has not, hitherto, indeed been at any time the effect of
an improvement to drive capital from the land, nor consequently
to lower rent.[41]

_Industry, entrepreneurs, and science_
If agriculture was believed by most political economists to respond so
readily to technological innovation, the prospects for industry seemed
even more inspiring. Political economists chose from the industrial
sector their endless examples of the extension of the division of labour,
the origins of capital and machinery, and the contribution of entre-
preneurial skill and scientific knowledge. Skill and the division of
labour were widely celebrated as causes of industrial growth, but so
also were capital accumulation and the introduction of machinery. A
novel perception making its first appearance in writing on the industrial
sector was an idea of the importance of capital and machinery. Political
economists wondered at the possible connections between capital
accumulation, the progress of civilisation, and the division of labour. It
was argued that industrial growth brought greater security, and created
the stable foundations for the emergence of a capital market.[42] It was
widely assumed, though only occasionally made explicit, that private
property, especially in human industry and capital, was sacred to the
creation of wealth.[48]

When political economists such as Say or McCulloch referred to
capital formation, they included the development of labour productivity.
They regarded education and other institutions for the training and
socialisation of labour as aspects of capital formation. The sums spent
on rearing a worker were consumed in a reproductive way, and educa-
tion yielded an interest payment independent of the ordinary profits of

-----

industry.[44] Though great attention was given to such factors which
tended to increase the productivity of labour, it was also recognised that
capital formation included the introduction of machinery. The intro-
duction of machinery into industry seemed to constitute a sharp break
from the general division of labour. McCulloch in fact chastised Smith
for giving all his attention to the division of labour and neglecting the
breakthrough constituted by machinery.[45] Mechanisation was not simply
another stage of or implication of the division of labour, for there were
many structural limitations on any easy transition from the latter to the
former. Mechanisation, he argued, had to meet with the limitations
imposed by high capital investment requirements, by immobile labour,
and by patents or other forms of restriction.[46] It was, therefore, seldom
sudden, particularly because entrepreneurs were themselves slow to move
from industries where they had gained their habits, experience and
talent.[47]

The manufacturing sector was endowed, it was argtied, with special
attributes for the extension of capital and machinery. Torrens argued
that the existence of manufacturing capital could be traced back to the
very earliest of times. He did not believe that the existence of manu-
facturing was based on surpluses generated in agriculture, as in the
pattern of the stages theory of economic development popular in
eighteenth-century social analysis. This theory, simply put, concluded
that economic development ought to occur via an advance from hunt-
ing and gathering stages to an agricultural stage, and thence from
agriculture to manufacturing and commerce. Torrens, disregarding
such an idea, claimed that manufacturing industry actually succeeded
the phase of appropriative industry (or hunting and gathering). The
power of manufacturing would be unlimited so long as capital continued
to accumulate and population to increase.[48] The employment of
machinery, if only in manufacturing industry, would also have great
repercussions on the agricultural sector by lowering the costs of the
farmer's outlays on industrial goods. Torrens's farseeing technological
imagination was also manifest in his later work where he envisaged
steam replacing horses on 'all the great lines of traffic', and thought it

not improbable that 'plough and harrow would be moved by steam as
well as carriage and wagon'.[49]

This perception of technological advance within and from the
industrial sector was embellished by the attention given by political
economists to entrepreneurial skill and scientific knowledge. There was
actually little overt discussion among British political economists of
the 'labour' or skill of the capitalist. It was, rather, the French theorist
J. B. Say who claimed the entrepreneur as his own concept. Say defined
the entrepreneur as someone who was master of all that was known in
a particular branch of industry, and who had collected the requisite
capital and labourers. And he attributed commercial success in Great
Britain to the 'wonderful practical skill of her adventurers' in the
application of knowledge.[50]

Prinsep, the translator of Say's Trcrite, in fact found it difficult to
translate the word entrepreneur. He decided on the word 'adventurer'
to describe the person who took on himself the immediate responsibility,
risk and conduct of a concern.[61] Say argued that the technical skill
necessary to the entrepreneur could only be gained in the practical
pursuit of the occupation concerned. In most industries there was a
need for repeated experiment attended by more or less risk. This risk
had to be borne by the entrepreneur.[52] He justified entrepreneurial
income as a return for the moral qualities required, for the necessity of
ensuring an enterprise had capital, and for undertaking the risks and
hazards associated with enterprise. The entrepreneur was, therefore,
drawing in three incomes: a wage payment, interest on capital, and a
premium for risk.[58] Say criticised Smith for neglecting the difference
between gains of superintendence and the return on capital. The profits
of the labour of superintendence were dependent on skill, activity and
judgement, while those on capital were dependent on scarcity of capital
and security of investments. Since the manager of a firm rarely bor-
rowed all his capital, he was entitled to one portion of his revenue as
manager and to another as capitalist.[54] Most of the English writers took
the entrepreneurial function for granted as an initial condition for the
accumulation of fixed and circulating capital. A few commented on the

role of 'supervision' and were only keen on patent regulations to ensure
that sufficient time and energy be devoted to the discovery of new
techniques.[55]

Say's attention to the entrepreneur probably also influenced his
singular interest in the practical uses of scientific advance. Though
English economists showed interest in the inducements to invention, and
recommended patent regulation to promote advances in technology,
none of them showed any interest in advances in scientific knowledge.
Say had enlightened ideas of the direct and indirect influences of science.
He perceived the direct impact of the utility of many sciences which,
until recently, had only been seen as 'objects of curiosity and speculation'.
What most impressed him, however, was the powerful indirect influence
of science. Science dispelled prejudice. It taught man to rely on his own
exertions rather than on supernatural powers. 'Ignorance' was the
'inseparable concomitant of practical habits' and of 'that slavery of
custom'.[56] If workmen understood the nature of the things they worked
with, they would be more productive. Furthermore, science could
'increase social happiness' by acting as an antidote to alienation.[57]

This is not to suggest, however, that Say regarded science as the key
to industrial advance. Scientific knowledge was indispensable, but it
was not a major bottleneck. Men of science were interested in the
diffusion of their ideas, so that scientific knowledge circulated rapidly
and the nation without scientists need be at no disadvantage. Say
identified the crucial bottlenecks as the 'application of knowledge' and
the 'skill of execution'. These attributes were extremely difficult to
transmit to others.[58]

Say, however, kept his analysis of the role of entrepreneurship and
science within the confines of the division of labour, for he associated
both with the social division of labour. Sismondi, his contemporary,
made the connection explicit by arguing that the specialisation gave
rise to a group in society that abandoned manual labour to study the
means of controlling the forces of nature.[59] Say gave practical effect to
such ideas by suggesting the employment of surpluses via government
expenditure on the promotion of science. Science could only be applied
to practical purposes if it was discovered and preserved by the theorist.

Thus, the government should find some means of paying theoretical
scientists: 'A government that knows and practises its duties and has
large resources at its disposal should not abandon to individuals the
whole glory and merit of invention.'[60] Government support for scientific
research was not to be deducted from national capital, but from national
revenue. If the burden was paid by all, then all would benefit.[61]

Further, government support by honours and rewards to 'artists' and
mechanics was also to be encouraged : 'They excite emulation and en-
large the general stock of knowledge without diverting industry and
capital from its own most profitable channels.'[62] Finally, Say argued
that another form of encouragement, patents, acted as a premium from
the government chargeable on the consumers of the new article. They
were harmless, since they offered no interference with other branches
of industry.[63]

The great enthusiasm for the extension of science, capital and
machinery felt by many of the economists of the time even found its
way into political thought. The growth of capital was the fulfilment
of the public interest.[64] The rise of the middle classes derived from the
expansion of fixed capital. As W. A. MacKinnon put it, the middle
class was created on the basis of the social mobility brought about by
the extension of machinery :

in all establishments where machinery is used, a great expansion
takes place amongst the leading men of every branch of the
department, amongst the engine makers, etc., men who by their
industry, knowledge and attention to business have attained
such situations; or by others who, from their probity, good
conduct and fair dealing, have the loan of some capital,
which enables them in time, to create some for themselves.
All these descriptions of persons originating in the lower class,
rise by degrees into the middle.[65]

The social division of labour also accounted for the distinctive positions
of capitalist and worker, for these were related to the emergence of
particular divisions of income. Sismondi distinguished the revenue of
capitalists from fixed and circulating capital. It was only the capitalist
who possessed consumer goods, primary materials, and machinery. He
put these out to work for him and as compensation received the greater
part of the fruits of labour - the profits of capital. The poor had only
their labour and were dependent on a superior class to make that
labour effective.[66] This social division of labour was further reinforced,
argued Say, by the technical one. The worker's incapacity for anything
but one occupation rendered him less powerful to enforce his right to
an equitable portion of the gross value of production.

The workman, that carries about with him the whole imple-
ments of his trade, can change his locality at pleasure, and even
his subsistence wherever he pleases: in the other case he is a
mere adjective, without individual capacity, independence or
substantive importance, when separated from his fellow
labourers; and obliged to accept whatever terms his employer
thinks fit to impose.[67]

Smith's analysis of the division of labour was in effect revitalised during
these years and extended to its limits in the consideration of machinery.
Though the framework of analysis adopted by political economists
in the 1820s centred on the division of labour, the way the concept was
used thus underwent many changes. A recognition of the significance
of labour to the new industrial processes, as well as a perception of the
characteristics of the many varieties and levels of skill, gave political
economists a critical approach to theories of wages and population.
Debate over the future of the agricultural sector also generated new
theories of agricultural improvement. But in turning to the analysis of
industry it was also apparent that political economists had come to use
the concept of the division of labour in a sense increasingly associated
with labour discipline, industrial concentration, and the subordination
of the labourer to the subjective framework of the entrepreneur and
the capitalist. This orientation became even clearer when political
economists were presented with practical problems of economic crisis
and technological unemployment.

_Crisis, machinery and politics_
The theoretical interests economists of the period had in analysing and
explaining industrialisation were compounded by practical concerns.
Economists in the decade of the 1820s were capable of showing great
interest in the processes of scientific and technical change, and indeed
great enthusiasm for it. However, this was not a blind optimism, for the
outcome of all the great advances in technology over the period extend-
ing back to the late eighteenth century was still too uncertain to predict.
Alongside the hopefulness for economic growth, there was an atmosphere
of ambivalence in many economic tracts of the period, and even some
attempts to look critically at the costs and benefits of the industrialising
process. The age of mid-Victorian self-satisfaction was yet to come.
Major areas where some estimate of gains and losses became an issue
were the fears of overproduction, gluts and underconsumption left by
the post-Napoleonic depression, the challenge of Owenite and other
radical alternative production arrangements, and the confrontation
between the advocates of machinery and labour.
In many ways the debate on public works and other social schemes
was part of the wider debate on the crisis. Most politicians recognised
the existence of an economic depression from 1816 to the mid 1820s,
but they differed on policy proposals to bring the crisis to an end. Boyd
Hilton has recently defined a bold demarcation between Tory and Whig
policies as a contrast between passive and active philosophies. Tory
policies could be justified by Ricardian theories which condoned
inaction, and Whig policies were backed by Malthusian underconsump-
tionist demands for radical intervention.[68] Those hoping for novel
policies to revive the economy felt great frustration with the current
policy or rather[ c] non-policy[5] of allowing the crisis to work its own way
out. As one malcontent put it:

Nothing can be more annoying than the levity with which
some persons... treat the present state of the country, fancying
that its distress will correct the mischief, and that things will
find their proper level. Perhaps some of these wise people might
as well talk of the advantage of re-organizing by returning to
a state of nature. But we are in a very artificial state.[69]

The machinery question added to the complexities of the debate on
the crisis. A letter from Lord Kenyon to Liverpool in December 1819
highlights the predicament. Kenyon accepted that there should be no
government interference. He acknowledged, however, that such non-
intervention would not mitigate the crisis, since he believed that there
was little prospect of any return to affluence. This was because rising
rates of mechanisation had 'rendered the present crisis much more
serious and less self correcting than previous depressions'. 'I should
concur with you in thinking that any interference on the part of
Government was altogether undesirable (except in a trifling degree on
acct. of local distress) but I much fear we cannot hope for any return of
such sort of prosperity on account of the extensive use of machinery
and the contemplated increased use of it.'[70]

The promotion of employment schemes did, however, continue
throughout this period. But now it was increasingly identified with
underconsumptionist economics. Malthus's interest in public works
derived from his underconsumptionist ideas. Thus he argued that any
transfer of funds from productive to unproductive expenditure increased
the level of effective demand and the profit rate.[71] Malthus's under-
consumptionist fears were refuelled by the prospect of machinery leading
to general overproduction. Such fears rested on his assumption that a
leisured unproductive class was necessary to soak up the surplus. For he
believed that neither capitalists nor workers had very expansive
consumption patterns.[72] In contrast, Sismondi, who also believed that
the widespread use of machinery would lead to overproduction, ex-
plained this by the unequal distribution of income. He believed that the
working classes had a very high elasticity of demand, and a shift in the
distribution of income from the rich to the poor would open an in-
finitely extendible market. Hence there would be no need to worry
about the prospects of a general glut.[78]

The underconsumptionist idea also informed much of the basis of
Robert Owen's schemes. Owenite Utopian schemes found their roots in

the disputes over gluts and crises, in the schemes for the employment
of the poor, and in the public works projects which had been in great
vogue in the period just prior to the 1820s.[74] The government, in 1817,
had granted funds for public works schemes, and in fact Owen had
been put on the committee of the Association for the Relief of the
Manufacturing Poor in the same year. His plans were very much in
the tradition of the comprehensive blueprints drawn up to solve a whole
range of social evils, and usually involved varying themes on resettle-
ment and cottage industry for the poor.[75] However, by the time of
Liverpool's ministry and the adoption by the government of its economic
policy of inaction, schemes such as Owen's were no longer regarded
seriously by those in power. Liverpool claimed that short-term aid to
workers in redundant occupations would only impede beneficial
redeployment.
Owen was not perturbed by such dismissive attitudes on the part of
the state, and like Malthus continued to develop his own approach to
economics, an approach which absorbed underconsumptionist assump-
tions but gave these a radical twist. He argued, for instance, that it was
the lack of a profitable market that alone checked the beneficial industry
of the working classes.[76] Owen's underconsumptionist economics
justified his negative attitudes to industrialisation. But he argued that
the consequent social dislocations could be prevented by positive action
in favour of education and new forms of social organisation. Owen
relates carrying on extensive discussions with political economists. He
was 'desirous to convince them that national education and employ-
ment could alone create & permanent national, intelligent, wealthy, and
superior population, and that these results could be attained only by a
scientific arrangement of the people, united in properly constructed
villages of unity and co-operation'.[77]

Whatever the views of the government on the Owenite projects,
Robert Owen did not lack followers. Certainly Owenism was what
caught the imagination of those who conceived either of some alter-
native direction or of more equitable distribution of the benefits of the

industrial transformation of Britain. The movement was eclectic enough
to gather:

artisans with their dreams of short circuiting the market
economy; skilled workers with their thrust towards general
unionism; the philanthropic gentry, with their desire for a
rational planned society; the poor with their dreams of land or
Zion; the weavers with their hopes of self employment; and
all of these with their image of an equitable brotherly com-
munity, in which mutual aid would replace aggression and
competition.[78]

The impact of machinery was a key element of Owenite economics.
Owen argued that the huge productivity increase consequent on
technical change entailed the exploitation, misery, and moral
degradation of labour. He argued in his Report to the County of
_Lanark for an intensive agriculture based on spade husbandry which_
would enable food supply both to keep pace with population growth
and to provide for greater employment.[79] He maintained, in addition,
that commercial competition had stimulated invention, but had made
men selfish.
Machinery used in the context of the wage bond had degraded labour
into a dispensable commodity. It had encouraged competition for
wealth and divided men when they should have been united.[80] Owen
wished to extract technical progress from the social arrangements in
which it had been developed, and to redirect it in an attempt to avoid
the minute division of labour.[81] In his community he envisaged all
taking part in one or more of the occupations in a department, 'ordered
by every improvement that science can afford', and that this employ-
ment would alternate with work in agriculture and gardening.
Needless to say, there was almost an over-reaction to Owen in middle-
class circles. Torrens referred to him as belonging[ c]to the order of
political alchemists'.[82 c]Mr. Owen shows himself profoundly ignorant
of all the laws which regulate the production and distribution of wealth.
He tells us, that the distress to which the people of this country are

exposed arises from scientific and mechanical power producing more
than the existing regulations of society permit to be consumed.[583]

McGulloch was no less scathing of the political economy of Owenism.
He reported Owen's speech on the crisis in the Scotsman in 1819, but
it was not until 1821 that he came to vent his full wrath. He pointed out
that Owen's theories on spade husbandry, the division of the population
into parallelograms, and the discarding of the minute division of labour
were all wrong. The greatest drawback of such ideas was that they led
to indolence. No individual could 'raise himself above the common
herd'. The commercial arrangements of his textile communities were
defective, and they had no mechanism for adjusting the quantity of
yarn produced to effective demand.
However, incredulity on the part of most political economists did not
perturb Owen from seeking the ear of the Political Economy Club. He
attended as a guest of Grote in 1822 and presented the particulars of his
plan for 'ameliorating the condition of mankind', and some of the
principles of his system.[84]

The conflict between the political economists and the Owenite
Visionaries' was dramatised in the public debating sessions of the philo-
sophic radicals and members of an Owenite co-operative society.[85] The
sectarian spirit of the philosophic radicals here found a platform, though
not a particularly acrimonious one. J. S. Mill reports one such debate
on population which went on through five or six meetings. Another on
the general merits of Owen's system lasted for three months.

It was a little corp a corps between Owenites and political
economists, whom the Owenites regarded as their most
inveterate opponents; but it was a perfectly friendly dispute.
We who represented political economy had the same objects
in view as they had and took pains to show it; and the principal
champion on their side was a very estimable man, with whom

I was well acquainted, Mr. William Thompson of Cork, author
of a book on the Distribution of Wealth and of an 'Appeal' on

Government.[86]

This is not to say, however, that Mill took a particularly favourable
view of Owenism. Rather, he hoped that middle-class fears of the
extremes of Owenism would encourage reform, working-class education,
and more democratic institutions.[87]

Certainly it was not only the entrenched members of the Political
Economy Club who took exception to Owen's schemes. Several dissi-
dents too were not very convinced. John Barton, though he had taken
great pains to stress the many limitations on the demand for labour in
an industrialising society, did not promote projects for employing the
poor. He argued that neither the manufacturing corporations of Josiah
Child nor the village co-operatives of Owen could increase the demand
for labour: they only drew labour from other employments.[88] Simon
Gray questioned only what he regarded as the anti-technology bias in
Owen; he found Owen's views curious for one who was a manufacturer
employing a large capital in machinery.[89]

_Machinery and labour_
The disputes on machinery were, however, much more far-reaching
than the hopes and threats of Owenism. An immediate concern to
political economists was Ricardo's remarkable intervention in the issue
as well as actual events of machine breaking. This made machinery
both a real practical concern and an analytical puzzle to the economists
of the 1820s. The machinery question became one of the most
important incidents of the interrelation of theory and a political issue.
It became a discussion question in the Political Economy Club,[90] and
was debated at the most concrete levels among manufacturers during
the 1826 riots.
The destruction of machinery was a definite part of working-class
struggle in early industrial England. The critique of machinery was to
remain an important part of working-class ideology until well after

Chartism and indeed, even until the end of the nineteenth century.[91]

The pre-industrial riot was characteristically the food riot, and was
directed against the corn middleman.[92] But it was mechanisation which
took the centre stage from the late eighteenth century onwards.
Machinery became the most immediate basis for the relationship be-
tween capitalist and worker. It was the machine which defined the
organisation of work and which held the balance of power in the
determination of the distribution of returns from labour. More
fundamentally, machinery threatened displacement of labour in a period
of low labour mobility, no industrial retraining schemes, and no
redundancy payment. The machinery issue also provoked significant
divisions among the radicals. William Cobbett, for example, took a
stand against many of his fellow radicals on the Luddite question. In
his 'Letter to the Luddites', published in the Political Register in 1816
and reprinted in 1823, he had argued that there could be no solid
objection to machinery in general. He accused writers 'on the side of
corruption' of 'inculcating notions hostile to machinery as well as notions
hostile to butchers and bakers', and went on to argue that the wages
saved by the employment of machinery in one sector could be used to
employ labour in a different sector. He concluded his pamphlet with a
threat of a loss of foreign trade if technical change was held back, and
blaming the burden of taxation for the distress.[93]

This pamphlet provoked a public reply from Ricardo, who, in debate
in the House of Commons, said he was not satisfied with its reasoning.
It was 'evident, that extensive use of machinery, by throwing a large
portion of labour into the market, while, on the other hand, there might
not be a corresponding increase of demand for it, must, in some degree,
operate prejudicially to the working classes'. But he stressed he would
not tolerate any law to prevent the use of machinery. If the country
'gave up the system that enabled [it] to undersell in the foreign market,

would other nations refrain from pursuing it? Certainly not.' They
were bound by their own interest to continue it.[94]

The Tory ministers saw the anti-machinery aspect of the reaction to
distress as a political affair. Liverpool had admitted in 1819 that
industrialisation brought social problems, however, he believed the
French Revolution was responsible for the democratic ideas which led
to the resistance to its effects:

Tho' it cannot be denied that the great increase of our manu-
facturing population, the dependence of a great part of that
population on Foreign Demand, and the refinements in
Machinery (which enable manufacturers to perform that work
in weeks which formerly occupied months and which leads
consequently to extravagant wages at one time and to low and
inadequate ones at another), have recently subjected this
country to evils with which in the same degree we were formerly
unacquainted, yet all these circumstances would not have
accounted for the present state of the Public Mind in certain
parts of the Country if the events of the French Revolution
had not directed the attention of the lower Orders of the
Community and those immediately above them to Political
Considerations, had not shaken all respect for established
authority and ancient Institutions and had not familiarized
mankind with a system of organization which has been justly
represented to be as ingenious and appropriate to its purpose
as any Invention of Mechanics.[95]

The 1826 riots in Lancashire posed the issue squarely. These riots took
place in a year of crisis which had opened with financial disruption;
amid signs of increasing wealth in 1825 the capital market had collapsed.
There had been a flurry of joint stock ventures and speculation, and the
final crash in December 1825 brought down forty-three country banks.
Hilton has given a very compelling picture of the impact of the 1825-6
crisis on public consciousness. He argues that the crisis left its mark on
economic thought and literature by creating a gloomy preoccupation
with business failures.[96]

One effect of this crash was a series of riots in the manufacturing
districts in the early spring of 1826.[97] The reaction to the riots was
sharp. Local newspaper editors who endorsed classical political economy
wrote tracts on machinery to be distributed among the workpeople.
The most well known of these were Archibald Prentice's 'On the Causes
and Cure of the Present Distress[3] and Edward Raines's Letter to the
_Unemployed Workmen of Lancashire and Yorkshire. Prentice's pam-_
phlet blamed the depression on the currency, the Corn Laws, and
excessive government spending.[98] Baines stressed the advance of
continental industry, especially cotton manufacturing in Rouen, and
predicted that the machine breaking at Blackburn would encourage
manufacturers to leave the country and set up in France.
Baines's pamphlet was widely distributed and praised in government
and industry. Lord Lansdowne wrote:[ c]It is seldom indeed that the
subjects connected with the most important principles of political
economy are discussed in a manner so calculated to make them accept-
able to the understanding of the many.'[99] Bannister Eccles, one of those
Blackburn manufacturers whose mills had been attacked, thought
Baines's pamphlet had done much good in the area by removing the
prejudice against the power loom.[100]

The Letter to the Unemployed Workmen was also the subject of a
significant correspondence between Baines and Simonde de Sismondi.
The correspondence is an interesting study of the confrontation of
theory with the practical issues of the day, and depicts the interaction
between a provincial industrial ideologue and an internationally known
intellectual. Baines sent Sismondi a copy of the Letter, which he regarded

as a refutation of the latter's doctrines.[101] Sismondi took the opportunity
of reply to reassert his underconsumptionist beliefs. He regarded 1826
as 'giving a fatal direction' to the efforts of a people to become the
manufacturers of the world.[102] He objected, not to machinery, but to
the unjust division of its products, and counselled Baines to look at the
1826 crisis in terms of the glut and the social organisation of industry:

This permanent and universal glut is absolutely inexplicable
on the system of your economists Messrs. Ricardo, McCulloch
etc., but it is in my opinion a necessary consequence of the
direction industry has taken... I have never dreamt of
preventing by any law the improvement of machinery, nor
even of discouraging ingenious men from the invention of new
machines; all that I should wish is to render it impossible for
the master manufacturers to extort from their workmen what
they cannot obtain from the consumer.[103]

McCulloch and Place took predictable stands on the riots. Both
confronted the machinery issue of 1826 in the context of previous
working-class revolt. McCulloch thought popular ignorance of political
economy was one reason for the opposition to technical progress.[104] He
argued that the Lancashire riots would discourage investment and lead
to further reductions in the demand for labour.[105]

The struggle of the working classes against the encroachment of
machinery was an unending preoccupation of Francis Place. Over the
years he had corresponded on the issue with trade associations, unions,
and political groups. Not only the recent weaving riots, but the problems
of the operative sawyers, the Frome woollen committee, newspaper
printers, and paper makers gave him ample evidence for a series of letters
on machinery to the Bolton Chronicle in 1826.[106] Place simply repeated

his old views that distress was not due to machinery, but to population
increase.[107] William Ellis's apt piece, the 'Employment of Machinery',
raised the level of debate by pointing out the significance of the timing
of technical change. He argued that most new processes were introduced
in times of prosperity, not in times of crisis.[108]

The analysis of the phenomenon of resistance to machinery was
continued at a more sophisticated level by political economists who
tried to respond to Ricardo's difficult and provocative chapter on
machinery. The ideas developed by John Barton and Ricardo on the
relationship between fixed capital investment and the demand for labour
provoked severe reaction. Unlike the underconsumptionists, they both
started from the assumption of fully-employed factor markets. Barton
was the first to distinguish fixed and circulating capitals according to
their impact on the labour market. In his Observations, 1817, he took
issue with the view that every increase of capital set in motion an
additional quantity of labour:

The demand for labour depends, then, on the increase of
circulating and not of fixed capital. Were it true that the
proportion between these two sorts of capital is the same at all
times and in all countries, then indeed it follows that the number
of labourers employed is in proportion to the wealth of the
state. But such a position has not the semblance of probability.
As arts are cultivated and civilization extended, fixed capital
bears a larger and larger proportion to circulating capital...
It is easy to conceive that under certain circumstances the whole
of the annual produce of an industrious people might be added
to fixed capital, in which case they would have no effect in
raising the demand for labour.[109]

Barton argued that there was a long-run tendency to rising capital
intensity. As capital became more plentiful it was invested in the
construction of machinery, in making roads, digging canals, and other
improvements which brought about some saving in labour. Barton
tempered the force of his conclusions, however, by pointing out that as
long as capital accumulation, development, and technical change

continued to take place, there need never be great fears over the demand
for labour. The actual process of fixed capital formation was a great
employer of labour.[110]

Ricardo's reformed views on machinery and labour, incorporated
into the third edition of his Principles were, as I have shown, a develop-
ment of Barton's possible case. Given a fixed supply of capital, labour
was transferred from the production of necessaries, or consumer goods,
to the production of machinery. This decline in the funds for the employ-
ment of labour would lead to a decline in the demand for labour over
the economy as a whole.[111] There would be an increase in net revenue or
surplus, and a decline in gross revenue or total final product while the
machinery was under construction. Demand for labour would always
be dependent on the expansion of gross revenue.
The reaction provoked by this analysis was not only the immediate
one I have described in Chapter 4 above, but a long-term interest in
the issue. Torrens and Ellis both made more serious attempts to come
to terms with Ricardo's chapter on machinery, mainly by investigating
alternative sources of investment. Torrens, for instance, argued that
the capitalist would have no motive for constructing a machine unless
it led to a higher rate of profit. But, as profits increased, capital would
accumulate more rapidly, and this more rapid accumulation would
restore the original demand for labour.[112] Torrens also saw fit to include
an entire chapter refuting Ricardo's views in his popular work Wages
_and Combinations in 1834. Ellis went yet a step further to argue that_
the original investment for the machine-making sector need not be taken
from a 'wage fund' but could be drawn from increased savings induced
by the expectation of higher profits after the machinery was built, and
that this process would be self-perpetuating: 'When that additional
capital is introduced, motives in abundance are presented for a still
further accumulation, since profits will have risen in as much as the
same number of labourers, aided by more powerful instruments, will be
able to produce a larger quantity of commodities.'[118]

The impact of higher saving and profit rates was a very important
counteracting factor, but even more so was the relative time period in
which new machinery would be introduced. Simon Gray was the one
who pointed out that the major periods for the introduction of new
machinery were advancing ones, when both prices and wages were high.
The wages of both the makers and users of the new machinery had
historically been higher than those of former employees. Furthermore,
the construction of machinery was a new and thriving branch of
industry which could only be regarded as an important spin-off of
mechanisation.[114] Arguments along the lines of these criticisms of
Ricardo's chapter were echoed frequently through the pamphlet
literature of the period in what were often long and turgid justifications
of the introduction of machinery.[115]

Even Malthus held no real objections to the extension of machinery
_per se. His real worry was the extension of demand in proportion to_
the increase in productivity. He was, however, never very impressed
with Owen's proposals for spade husbandry, and his reason for this
can be found in his dispute with John Barton.[116] Malthus at first dis-
agreed with Barton's view that the demand for labour was tied to the
increase of circulating, not fixed capital. This disagreement rested on
Malthus's belief that any increase in fixed capital was generally
favourable to circulating capital. If the advance in fixed capital was
gradual, it would lead to increased productivity and cultivation of
waste land. A higher proportion of population would be released to
manufacturing, the value of general production would rise, and with
it the demand for labour.[117] The natural tendency of machinery was to
cheapen a commodity and thus to extend the market. In practice,
however, there was often a substantial loss involved in transferring
capital from one employment to another: 'The power of the whole
capital to command the same quantity of labour would depend on the
contingency of vacant capitals being withdrawn undiminished from old
occupations and finding equivalent employment in others.'[118] Malthus's
obsession with the market led him to enthuse over the reciprocal action
of the extension of foreign markets and the invention of machinery.
This reaction to the doubts of Ricardo and Barton was soon to become

the characteristic one. Theorists admitted the conceptual possibility of
technological unemployment, but mitigated the force of Ricardo's case
by seeking counteracting factors. The pessimism of Barton and Ricardo
on the question of the impact of machinery on the working classes was
thus successfully relegated to the realm of analytical puzzles. The
theorists who followed Ricardo were uncertain enough of economic
prospects to comment extensively on the Ricardo case or the problem
in general. However, the end of their investigation was to submerge
these doubts by drawing practical and policy attention to the over-
powering counteracting factor of the growth potential in the total
British economy.

_Stationary states_
Finally, therefore, after a wide-ranging and remarkably intensive dis-
cussion on the prospects of British industry, economists seem to have
concluded on a fairly sanguine plane. Even if population or capital
should grow more quickly than was desirable, or even if capital was
scarce or wages high, there was always a self-generating form of tech-
nical progress which could ultimately overcome all these problems. But
there is still to be found in this period the shadow of those depressing
concepts of the declining rate of profit and the imminence of the
stationary state. Did economists in this period give any serious thought
to these apparently ambiguous concepts of Ricardian economics?
Many historians of economic thought have given rather excessive
concern to the role of the stationary state in classical economic theory.
They have accepted the classicals too easily 21s prophets of doom, and
have seldom stopped to question the status of the falling rate of profit
and the stationary state. They have too often confused the conceptual
systems of the classical economists with their individual attitudes to
reality.[119]

I have shown the attitudes of Ricardo and his contemporaries could
hardly be called ones of despair. And certainly the condition of the first
industrial workers had little to do with their ideas on the prospects of
British growth. If anything, it was the economist above all others who
was either optimistic or blind, and possibly both, to the conditions of
the working classes in northern towns or southern villages during the
period. It is certainly true that Ricardo's analytical system was set up to

explain the tendency towards a declining rate of profit, and it is also true
that he spoke of a future stationary state. But the practical eventuality
of either of these phenomena was almost inconceivable. It is important
to remember that Ricardo's system was also built up to recommend
ways of avoiding the falling rate of profit. Even Malthus regarded the
falling rate of profit as extremely remote. He argued that the decline in
the rate of profit that came from the progressive cultivation of poorer
land could be extremely slow or more than balanced by continual agri-
cultural improvement, including improved implements and machinery
as well as better systems of cropping and managing.[120] McCulloch, in
the 1820s, still believed in the final eventuality of the stationary state.
But again such a possibility was very remote. He argued that the pro-
ductive energies of the earth were constantly rising due to discoveries
and inventions: 'improvements in the skill and industry of the labourer
and in machinery may counterbalance the disadvantages of an inferior
soil and an unfavourable climate[5].[121] But still from the operation of
'fixed and permanent causes', the 'rise in the sterility of the soil must
in the long run overmatch the increasing powers of machinery[5].[122]

McCulloch, however, eventually gave up his earlier predictions of
diminishing returns and the stationary state altogether.[123]

This optimism was continued by both James and John Stuart Mill
who conceived of an ideal stationary state. The fame of the latter's
stationary state has often obscured that of the former. Winch, however,
has pointed out that James Mill introduced a series of social arguments
explaining why capital accumulated more slowly than population in-
creased : men reached a certain plateau of wealth where they had not
further motivation to accumulate, but many inducements to enjoy their
leisure.[124] John Stuart Mill did not give up the final stationary state,
though he left it a benevolent one. As Neil de Marchi puts it: 'Mill's
belief in the "habitual antagonism" of the "progress of civilization"
did not in any way undermine his opinion that diminishing returns
tended to outweigh cost-reducing improvements as such.[5125]

The political economists of the 1820s attached little practical signi-
ficance to the imminence of the stationary state. The power of technical
progress had gripped the imagination of most. The economists who
followed Ricardo criticised the conclusions of his model, but found in
it a source of inspiration. The model provoked many to investigate ways
of avoiding falling rates of profit and stationary states. One key was for
them to reveal the gains from technical change. The economists and
their substantially middle-class public showed great zeal in observing
and promoting the mechanisms of technological transformation in the
industrialising British economy. Their zeal was prompted partly by intel-
lectual debate and partly by pressing economic and political concerns.
After Ricardo no economist of the period, at least until the 1840s, could
ignore the influence and impact of his theories. His provocative formu-
lation of the economic problems of his time was vital to the direction of
development of economic ideas. I have already shown the degree to
which Ricardo's work was stimulated by contemporary issues and events;
and this chapter has indicated the extent to which this interaction of
theory and politics also continued throughout the 1820s. The response
to machinery had even greater political consequence in the wake of
economic crisis, Owenite radicalism, and the machine-breaking events
of 1826. The economists of the 1820s responded to Ricardo and to these
economic and political events by describing and endorsing the process
of industrialisation. With Adam Smith's perspectives on improvements
as their model, they developed a framework for economic development
which they believed to be an alternative to Ricardo's. Their theories
centred on the concept of the division of labour, but they used the
concept in new ways in order to integrate the machine and capitalist
accumulation into their visions of economic progress. The pattern of
their observations, defined by the idea of the division of labour, was
perhaps suggestive of the outline of the stage of economic development
defined by Marx as the 'phase of manufactures'. However, the
continuity of this pattern of ideas from the time of Smith into the 1820s
definitely underwent a change of emphasis in the 1830s. Political
economists moved on to describe, or at least to predict, a structural
shift in the economy to one based on fixed capital. Using Marx's terms
once again, this change in analysis could be described as belonging to
the new period of 'modern industry' in contrast with the period of
'manufactures' which still underlay the 1820s.

##### Political economy and capital

The determination of political economists in the 1820s to repudiate
what they understood to be the pessimistic conclusions of Ricardo's
theory was continued by the next generation of economists in the fol-
lowing decade. Their ideas, however, were placed in fundamentally
new perspectives, for the organising principle of their discussions of
technological improvement shifted from the division of labour to capital
formation. This shift was not a sharp intellectual break, but rather a
change in emphasis. As has been shown, both Torrens and McCulloch
placed a certain significance on capital formation and machinery, while
later writers including Senior and John Rae, continued to develop
the analysis of labour productivity, examining in detail skill and the
organisation of labour. It is, however, evident that 'technology' was
reformulated in the 1830s in terms of fixed capital and machinery.
This theoretical shift occurred within a definite intellectual and social
context. Intellectually, the economists of this decade were self-conscious
of their critical view of Ricardo and thought seriously about the impli-
cations of this for the public image of their discipline. They also
responded to political and social disturbance at the time, and attached
importance to the ideas and opinions they expressed on such matters
and to their authority as political economists. Both these intellectual
and social contexts were directly related to the theoretical analysis made
of the origins, prospects and form of technological improvement.
There has been a good deal of debate on the relationship of the politi-
cal economists of the 1830s to Ricardo. It has become almost traditional
to refer to economists such as Senior, Whately, Lloyd, and Longfield

as the critics of Ricardo. It was Schumpeter's view that by the early
1830s Ricardian economics was 'no longer a living force'.[1] Previously,
Marx had made the same point in his own way, regarding the 1830s as
the years when scientific economics gave way to apologetics.[2] Many
historians of economic thought have argued to a varying extent with
these two assessments.[3] It is only very recently that Samuel Hollander
and Neil de Marchi have questioned this breach. They have argued the
case that many of the points made by the critics were based on mis-
understanding of Ricardo, and that their critical economics was
actually much more compatible with Ricardo's than we have been led
to believe.[4] If the critics were indeed offering genuine alternatives to
Ricardo, then this also was not new, for diverse and critical inquiry
was just as much a characteristic of the previous decade as it was of
this one. It is true that mention is often made of a meeting of the
Political Economy Club on 13 January 1831 to discuss the progress
which had been made since Ricardo, and the extent to which Ricardian
economics had been undermined. But the conclusion reached by the
meeting indicated no major criticism. Mallet reports that:

McCulloch stood up vigorously for Value as well as Rent and
paid very high compliments to Ricardo whom he still considered
as right in most points, and at all events as having done the
greatest service to the science, his methodical and scientific
way of treating it, so that even where he was mistaken, his
errors could be detected by a subsequent and more correct
analysis.

The Political Economy Club, in fact, finally agreed that Ricardo's
_Principles were 'in the main right'.[5]_

Open dissension with Ricardo's views was feared for the effect it

might have on the public authority of the discipline. As Samuel Read
put it:

By all who are acquainted with the most recent and most noted
works on Political Economy, it will be readily admitted that the
science is at present in a very unsettled and unsatisfactory state.
There is indeed scarcely a single doctrine - if we except that of
_commercial freedom, as expressed long since by the French_
economists - upon which there is perfect and uniform, or even
general agreement, among the numerous sects and schools
into which the science is now divided.[6]

But such fears of differences of opinion in political economy were
endemic also to the years before and after the 1830s,[7] and concerns
over the public image of the discipline were only meaningful in a specific
social context - the practical political problem of Swing riots and
socialism. For these constituted a fundamental challenge both to the
success of the Industrial Revolution and to political economy's
optimistic predictions of its benefits.
Most economists of the time felt the need to respond to the social con-
flict generated by the agricultural riots of 1830 and by trade unionism,
and their concerns were soon increased by the emergence of organised,
doctrinal socialism. The agricultural riots had an immediate and exten-
sive influence on the political economists.[8] Mallet found the Political
Economy Club meeting of 3 December 1830 abuzz with news of the
disturbance: 'We were rather too full of politics, the destruction of
machinery, and so forth : the general opinion seems to be that if these
disorders lasted there must be either an increase of military force or
some sort of National Guard.'[9] The situation led to a special debating
session on 13 January 1831 on the subject of the causes of discontent
and distress in the agricultural districts. The members seem to have
agreed that there was no particularly pressing distress among the agri-
cultural labourers, and that the disturbances had 'originated in political

excitation': 'The concurrence I have mentioned as to the great
exaggerations which prevail and are industriously disseminated on the
subject of agricultural distress is the more remarkable as there are all
shades of political opinion among the Members of the Club, several
of whom are radical reformers.[510]

Senior opened his Three Lectures on the Rate of Wages by explaining
that they were written in a period of tranquillity, but that the country
was now 'in a state which may require the exertions of every individual
among the educated classes, and many may have to assist in executing,
or even in originating measures for the relief of the labouring popula-
tion, who are not yet sufficiently familiar with the principles according
to which that relief is to be afforded'.[11] The agricultural riots, too, were
the motivation for his long discussion in these lectures on machinery
and labour. His major fears were that The consequences of the present
system' had not been explained to labourers, hence the declaration of
their right to good wages. The greatest danger came from those who
'assumed the fund out of which the labourer is fed was unlimited'.

Have not even magistrates and landlords recommended the
destruction, or, what is the same, both in principle and effect,
the disuse of every machine of which the object is to render
labour more efficient in the production of the articles con-
sumed by the labourer in the production of that very fund on
the extent of which, compared with the number to be main-
tained, the amount of wages depends? ... Threshing machines
are the present objects of hostility, ploughs will be the next.[12]

A reviewer of the second edition of McCulloch's Principles saw utility
in poiltical economy at a time 'when the south of England is spread with
the smoking ruins of farm houses and the ashes of cornstacks and barns'.
He, too, claimed a lack of 'politico-economical knowledge' as the major
culprit: The outrages which the enemies of political economy deplore
in common with its friends, arise in the greatest part, and immediately,
from the vulgar errors concerning machinery and wages, which a
knowledge of the natural laws that regulate the production and

distribution of the wealth of nations can alone dissipate.[518] Another
_Edinburgh reviewer returned to the issue two years later to point out_
the educative role of recent works of popular political economy in
aiding the introduction of agricultural machinery.[14] Neither did the
readers of the Westminster Review escape the topical lessons of political
economy. T. Perronet Thompson reviewed The Life and History of
_Swing the Kent Rick-burner to warn readers of the outcome of an_
ignorance of political economy.[15]

If rioting in the countryside provoked such a reaction, there was
probably equal concern over the issue of trade unions and mechanisa-
tion. In 1832 Senior, along with Thomas Thomlinson, drew up a
'Report on Combinations'. The Report showed great concern with
trade union interference in technical progress, and even included
interviews with anonymous textile manufacturers. These interviews,
conducted with an elaborate questionnaire, helped Senior to 'prove'
that certain combinations had indeed interfered with the introduction
of new techniques.[16] The message was also clear in E. G. Tuffnell's
_Objects and Effects of Trades Unions of 1834._
This very specific context of immediate class struggle is to be distin-
guished from another bogey of the political economists. They also
voiced strong objections to the socialist vision. James Mill wrote to
Brougham in 1832 on the idea of the rights of the labourer to the whole
produce of his labour. He described this as 'the mad nonsense of our
friend Hodgkin which he has published as a system . . . These opinions,
if they were to spread, would be the subversion of civilized society.'[17]

Longfield warned that opinions were no longer inactive. The question
was no longer whether the working class would generate opinion, but
how 'a true sense of their own interests' was to be made clear to them.
Political economy was a 'defensive science' which attempts to 'prevent
the injudicious interference of speculative legislation'.[18] Scrope drew
attention to a general feeling throughout society that the 'physical and
mental happiness of man' were socially determined. Thus 'social
arrangements' could be infinitely improved. For Scrope, however,
political economy was not defensive; welfare was the primary object
of policy.[19] Finally, Senior saw himself grappling in his Outline of
_Political Economy with a new race of visionaries. One of his reviewers,_
in setting out Senior's dilemma, described the situation of many of the
theorists of the 1830s.

There is at work a wide-spread dissatisfaction with the present
state of society; and a disposition to trace all evils which afflict
it to the competition of capitalists and labourers amongst
themselves, and their supposed competition with each other.
It is as if the philosophical world, never long contented with a
simple adherence to the same system, had tried the laissez faire
theories of Smith and Turgot to the uttermost, and thrown
them aside in mere weariness, and through a desire for new
excitements.[20]

The work of individual socialist economists was usually mentioned with
respect to the discussion of attacks on profit and capital. Apart from
James Mill's allusions, Hodgskin was sketched by a writer in the
_Quarterly Review as an influence more 'pernicious than the Owenites'.[21]_

Scrope objected to the Owenites and the Saint-Simonians: 'Its designers
forget that the industry of which in the present advanced state of society
they witness the fruits, has been brought into being, and has hitherto
grown and thriven, only under the shelter of the institution of private
property and the stimulus of competition.'[22] But again it was Hodgskin

who came under his wrath when capital was the subject of discussion.
Hodgskin was identified with declamations 'against capital as the
poison of society, and the taking of interest on capital by its owners,
as an abuse, an injustice, a robbery of the class of labourers'.[23] Hodgskin
was not mentioned by Longfield, but he, too, identified as the source
of socialist doctrine one of those men who were 'conscious of their
invalidity', whose object was 'to create disturbance, by stimulating the
passions of the poor and ignorant, and persuading them that their
poverty is caused by oppression'.[24] Much of this polemic was situated
within discussions of the role of capital and the determination of the
rate of profits. It is indeed quite obvious that much of this new theory
was defensive and apologetic.
However, these same economists were simultaneously seeking an
escape from the political connotations of political economy. They
addressed themselves to those who dismissed political economy because
it was 'political'. One answer was that of Richard Whately who pre-
ferred to describe political economy as 'catallactics', the science of
exchanges. He used his credentials as a theologian in the Drummond
chair to fight the prejudice against political economy 'among those who
represent it as unfavourable to religion'.[25] Scrope argued that this
attitude to political economy was prevalent only because of the mistakes
of the economists themselves. Political economy had been discredited
by the 'dogmatism of the hyper economists'. He blamed empiricism and
practical men for the most pernicious errors. He also disclaimed the
tendency to see political economy as a physical science and was not
enthusiastic over any fashionable 'political mathematics'.[26]

This rhetoric, directed at those ignorant of the new discipline, was
increasingly put in terms neutral to politics. A debate on methodology
obscured more fundamental political differences. By professing to go
beyond politics, political economists hoped to open the discipline to a
wider audience. With this aim in mind Nassau Senior left behind the
political overtones to be found, for example, in his Introductory Lecture
_on Political Economy, in favour of greater methodological sophistica-_
tion. In 1826 he had complained of the 'many crude and mischievous
theories about, which are dignified with the name political economy*,

and he feared that the subject would be 'left by the advocates of religion
and social order to those hostile to both'.[27] In 1831 he argued

Hitherto, it has been common to defend every existing practice
as agreeable to common sense, in opposition to th** visionary
scheme of political theorists... To what has common
prejudice, reigning under the title of common sense, brought
me ? Have the practical men who have hitherto administered
our system of poor laws, saved us from being brought to the
very brink of ruin ?[28]

These political and methodological concerns added fuel to the efforts
of political economists in the 1830s to provide a theory of economic
development alternative to those of Malthus and Ricardo. For they
blamed the unfavourable light in which political economy was held
by much of the common public on the pessimistic predictions which
followed from Malthus's law of population and Ricardo's theory of
rent. They continued the critique of Ricardo which had occupied
economists of the 1820s. But great political and social tensions now
made a defence of the achievements of the Industrial Revolution all
the more pressing. To the critique of Ricardo, therefore, they appended
a detailed description and analysis of the technological improvements
and tendency to increasing returns evident in the past few decades.
Their defence of existing patterns of economic development and of the
credibility of the political economist's explanation of these became in
the political setting of the 1830s a strident polemic in favour of capital
and machinery. Economists argued on the basis of the economic and
technological advance of the past few decades that Malthus's law of
population and Ricardo's theory of rent appeared to be theoretical
irrelevancies. Herman Merivale pithily summed up the situation when
he said of the one 'The doctrine of population is, in Political Economy,
what that of original sin is in theology, - offensive to philosophical pride,
and irksome to sanguine temperaments.' People preferred to be told
'There are extrinsic causes at work, which promise to render the ancient
law of our nature a mere philosophical curiosity - a theorem without
application, - that machinery and science, and facilities of communi-
cation, are outstripping... numbers.'[29]

The other, Ricardian rent theory, he described as 'a Pupsis
_offencionis, startling and offending many'.[80] Senior and Scrope pointed_
out the effects of technological improvements: increasing returns to
labour due to economies of large-scale production, and advances in
agricultural techniques.[31] Richard Jones marshalled a barrage of
empirical and historical data to refute the Ricardian theory of rent.
The history of crop rotations, field combinations, fertilisers and artificial
grasses was evidence enough that the 'powers of the earth had come to
be kept in more constant and vigorous action'. 'The produce of the
earth, so far from experiencing a gradual diminution, is capable of
being indefinitely augmented, in proportion to the increase of skill, and
assistance it receives from capital.'[32] Scrope continued the reproof,
attaching such importance to technological improvement that he made
one of the primary objects of his Principles the refutation of the 'gloomy
predictions of the Malthusians'. He condemned Chalmers for his
obsession with the rate of population growth and the limits to agriculture,
ca most portentous and abominable doctrine', which kept him 'bound
within the necromantic circle which Malthus has forbidden him to
dream of overstepping'.[33]

The attitudes of many of these critics can be summed up in the words
of George Ramsay's praise for recent progress:

The products of manufacturing and commercial industry as
steadily increase in quantity as they improve in quality. The
rise in the raw material, which they derive from agriculture,
retards them, no doubt, a little in their course, but the vast
discoveries in machinery, and the prodigious facilities for
intercourse afforded by numerous canals and rail-roads far
outstrip this obstacle to their progress, and leave us lost in
amazement as well at their present state as at the prospect of
their future advancement. Now these improvements must

greatly tend not only to increase the mass of commodities, and
diminish their price, but also to raise the rate of profit.[84]

The efforts made by these economists to discount Ricardo's views
were redoubled in their many projects to provide an alternative form
of analysis. There were many similarities in these individual contri-
butions. There was in the first place a common set of themes to which
economists of the day addressed themselves, among which were a
number dealing explicitly with economic development and the advance
of technology. The concept of abstinence was the first and most central
theme to their alternative perspectives on technology. They then went
on to examine entrepreneurial activity. On the basis of their endorse-
ment of the attributes of abstinence and entrepreneurial ability they
made a critical reassessment of the division of labour, placing it squarely
under capitalist subordination. After charting the paths to progress on
the basis of ideas of abstinence, entrepreneurship and division of labour,
economists went on to analyse capital and skill, the introduction of
machinery, and the emergence and choice of alternative technologies.
Finally, one other theme they explored to illustrate further their views
on the progress of technology was the contrast between the economic
structure of civilised and savage societies.

_Abstinence_
The firm belief in the gains from technical change was, as we have seen,
challenged by anti-machinery rioters, trade unionists and socialists, but
the challenge of the two latter groups went deeper, and questioned the
distribution of these gains. The gains of workers were small or non-
existent, they claimed, beside the colossal windfalls made by capitalists.
Economists, in answer, applied themselves to the defence of the capital-
ist's share. This share of income was justified as a return for a certain
activity - abstinence. Senior made abstinence a factor of production
in the same sense as labour, 'by the word Abstinence, we wish to express
that agent distinct from labour and the agency of nature, the con-
currence of which is necessary to the existence of Capital and which
stands in the same relation to Profits as Labour does to Wages'.[85] If
abstinence was a recurring activity fundamental to the creation of

capital, then so too, argued Senior, were other attributes of the capitalist
class, namely knowledge and skill. Wages and profits were a human
creation, and both depended on the sacrifice of ease or present enjoy-
ments. Profits should therefore include the 'wages' of the 'labour' of
the capitalist.[36] Senior considered the source of capital to be abstinence,
but the use of capital required two necessary corollaries: the use of
'implements' and the 'division of labour'. In the discussion of 'imple-
ments' he sets out his ideas on the special place of fixed capital and
machinery, which he distinguished from capital in general. These were
categorised into those that produced power such as machines worked
by wind, water, or steam, and those that transmitted power such as
hand-impelled tools. Implements could not be brought into use without
some exercise in abstinence. Carrying his theory of abstinence to an
extreme, he argued furthermore that it was a fiction for economists to
speak of landlord, capitalist and labourer as sharing in production.
All that was produced was, in the first instance, the property of the
capitalist. It was the capitalist who paid rent and wages prior to the
production process; it was the capitalist who abstained to make pro-
duction possible.[37]

Senior's hypothetical history of the origin and development of capital
was indicatively static. He failed to consider the possibility of one
production process growing out of another, or that the relations be-
tween social groups or classes involved in the production process might
have differed over time. However, his hypothetical history suited his
purposes, as was admirably borne out by the conclusions of those critics
who used a similar historical model. Longfield, too, made a case for the
application of capital 'in the support of labour' as the prior condition
of the introduction of machinery. This was the basis of wage payments.
The capitalist paid the labourer as much as he could earn without
the aid of machinery. Any productivity differentials after the intro-
duction of this fixed capital were defined as the property of the
capitalist.[88]

Neither Senior nor Longfield found it convenient to say anything of
the differences in the character or structure of a production process
after the introduction of the fixed capital they so hypothetically out-

lined. W. F. Lloyd, however, was more explicit: 'Employers, the owners
of much fixed capital, have a strong and direct interest in over-working
their labourers, and the smallness of their number, joined to the
superiority of their intelligence and other circumstances, gives to them a
power which throws the workmen entirely at their feet.'[89]

The payment of wages and the form in which those wages were paid
very closely mirrored these attitudes. Hobsbawm has evidence to show
that employers in the nineteenth century acquired their skilled labour
at less than market price because the workers' wage calculation was
for a long time determined by a customary pre-industrial wage hier-
archy.[40] The form of wages, however, became a major preoccupation
to employers after the first third of the nineteenth century. Economists
in the 1830s turned from an interest in wage levels to the systematic
treatment of the form of wage payments. They gave greater favour to
piece rates, and recognised this as a method of uniting the interests of
the worker to the output of machinery, a combination encouraging
greater efficiency.[41]

These political economists praised investment in fixed capital, but,
because they did not attempt its description or analysis they could only
assume a benign role for it. John Rae, the one economist who did
start such a classification scheme for capital, indeed developed the means
for explaining the very different types of impact any increase in fixed
capital might have. Furthermore, his system of classification provided
a quantitative measure of the impact of fixed capital. He argued that
capital was made up of what he termed 'instruments'. These included
all durable capital and other physical transformations designed to affect
future events, and each 'instrument' had a particular capacity to pro-
duce desired events. He measured this capacity by a standardised daily
wage because the cost of production of the instruments themselves was
measured by labour inputs. Each instrument not only had a capacity
to affect the future, but was subject to a process of 'exhaustion'. An
instrument was exhausted either when it was transformed into new
materials or when simply dissipated. It was exhausted more or less
slowly; food and fuel were quickly used up and machinery slowly.
Instruments could be placed in some quantitative order on the basis

-----

of their relative costs of production, their 'capacities', and their
'exhaustion' times. If they had a great capacity and a low cost of
production, capital would receive a fast return, rapidly reproducing
itself. The rate of return on capital could be raised by altering the
capacity, the cost of production or the exhaustion of an instrument. The
capacity of an instrument could be raised by adding either to its
durability or to its efficiency. However, without at the same time chang-
ing the techniques of production, 'neither of these could be indefinitely
increased without carrying instruments to orders of slower and slower
return'. If the capacity of an instrument was increased and the order of
an instrument either did not change or became one of faster return, this
was evidence of technical change. Furthermore, the impact of any
change in technique could be measured by comparing the change in
capacities with the change in the orders of the instrument in question.[42]

_Entrepreneur ship_
Abstinence formed only one of the justifications for the capitalist's share.
Others were his 'labour', skill, and enterprise. J. B. Say's pronounce-
ments on the importance of entrepreneurship were extended by these
economists to justify high capitalist profits.[43] 'Productive service' and
the 'wages of superintendence' were moulded into the conception of
industrial progress. Read asked : 'How much should be allowed as the
wage of the "owner of capital" superintending the industrious under-
taking?'[44] John Rae answered that the profit of stock must include a
return for the mental exertion and anxiety of the owner of stock.[45] J. S.
Mill argued that such a wage was not determined in the same way as
other wages, but was a commission on capital employed.[46] And Ramsay
went yet further, by distinguishing the functions of supervisor and
entrepreneur from that of the capitalist. The entrepreneur did not do
manual labour, and his profits could not be said to be proportional to
his 'mental qualities' as these could not be quantified.

On the one hand there are masters, on the other labourers,
capitalists and landlords, combined. The interests of these two
grand classes are diametrically opposed to each other. It is the
master who hires labour, capital and land, and of course tries
to get the use of them on as low terms as possible; while the
owners of these sources of wealth do their best to let them as
high as they can.[47]

It was not just trouble and skill, however, which should be compen-
sated by the wage of superintendence, but, as was maintained by Scrape,
the risks of obsolescence. 'The risks of these kinds attached to manu-
facturing operations are . . . much greater than in agriculture; and
hence the compensation or insurance against such risks must be
proportionately large.'[48] The level of payment for these qualities of
entrepreneurship and abstinence was expected to be determined by
social criteria. Returns, argued Scrope, were to be sufficient to pay the
ordinary rate of profit on total capital, 'as well as remunerate him for
his skill and trouble, according to the standard of remunerations gener-
_ally expected by his class[9].[49]_

_Paths to progress_
Political economists who looked to capital, and especially fixed capital,
to understand the sources of increasing returns went on from here to
describe the origins of existing techniques and to explain why certain
techniques had become predominant over others. They looked at the
different paths to progress in old and new countries, demonstrating the
different ways in which the division of labour was related to the origins
of capital accumulation and invention. To do this they discarded
Ricardo, and returned to the study of Smith. Like their predecessors
in the 1820s they sought ways of adapting the Smithian concept of the
division of labour to their understanding of contemporary patterns of
economic development. From the standpoint of their perspectives on
the central position of capital, therefore, they turned Smith's concept
of the division of labour on its head. It became the combination of
labour and concentration of capital, generated not just skill but 'mental

capital', and created the conditions for the emergence of the principles
behind invention.
Many of the ideas for the adaptation of the division of labour to the
context of capital were formulated in policy debates over colonisation.
The 'colonisers' combined their discussion of 'fields for the employment
of capital' with a political economy of new countries. They stressed,
not just technological improvement and capital formation in the British
economy, but the imperative of efficient production in new countries.
Malthus, Scrope, and Torrens all agreed that unless productivity in
agricultural countries kept pace with that of British industry, the net
barter terms of trade would turn against Great Britain. Colonising
would raise the rate of economic development in new countries,[50] but
only under certain conditions. As Wakefield argued, this development
was dependent upon what he termed the 'complex combination of
labour[5]. This principle included the creation of markets, the division
of labour, and capital accumulation. It was a principle natural enough
to old countries, but not to new colonies: 'without co-operation and
the division of employment, capital and labour are so weak and so
unproductive that surplus produce, either for foreign exchange or for
accumulation at home, cannot be raised. This is a primitive or bar-
barous state of things.'[51]

He argued that the prosperity of old countries was based on slavery
which had prevented the initial dispersal of industry, and referred to
his own recommendation of complex combination as one of 'natural
slavery'.[52]

McGulloch's continued interest in the division of labour and the
limitless prospects of invention gathered momentum as he traced the
interaction between concentration and the division of labour, and
accumulated evidence in favour of his prejudices for growth biased to
the manufacturing sector.[53] But he met his match in his enthusiasm
for the division of labour in Senior, who harnessed the principle to his
analysis of the British economy, but subordinated it to capital. Senior

not only made capital a prior condition of the division of labour, but,
by association, of the possession of tools and the creation of private
property as well. He described as a 'rude state' one where everyone
owned all the implements. Technological progress itself confirmed this.
**When expensive machinery and a great variety of tools had superseded**
the few simple implements, 'those only who can profitably employ them-
selves in any branch of manufacture' are those 'who can acquire
machinery or are trained to work it'.[54] The division of labour would
react in turn by helping to generate a transfer of labour from unpro-
ductive sectors to those under capitalist control.

The division of labour has banished from our halls to our
manufactures the distaff and the loom : and if the language
to which we have been adverting were correct, the division
of labour must be said to have turned spinners and weavers
from unproductive into productive labourers and from pro-
ducers of immaterial services into producers of material
objects.[55]

Richard Jones provided a yet more effective integration of the division
of labour and capitalist control. The division of labour was implemented
in agriculture and in manufacturing by the knowledge and superin-
tendence of the capitalist:

observe the skill, knowledge, and thoughtf ulness by which the
whole complex business of cultivation is conducted;... well
devised continuous industry aided by animal power, by
manures, by implements and machines, supplies to the task of
tillage a power far beyond what the more manual labourer can
command ... The scattered artizans of other realms collected,
here, into workshops and manufactories, the eye of a superior
enforcing everywhere steady and continuous labour; knowledge
and science importing to human industry a sovereign power
over the material world.[56]

Jones stressed that the division of labour was 'only one, and a subordin-
ate, though important effect of the accumulation of capital in produc-
tion[5].[57]

**54 Senior, An Outline, p. 74.**
**55 Ibid. p. 53.**
**86 Richard Jones, Literary Remains, p. 12.**
**57 Ibid. p. 33.**


-----

The formation of the human agency, by which the continuity
of labour is secured; the maintenance of the intellect which
enlightens its application; the employment of power which
resides either in a higher order of moving forces or in mechanical
contrivance,... are contributions of capital... it is the same
capital which makes the division of labour possible by maintain-
ing the workmen in the progress of their task till markets are
found for their commodities.[58]

Private property and capitalist control were seen by Senior, Jones,
and their contemporaries to be the natural foundations for the division
of labour. Scrope made a political point of the necessity of the principle
of private property. Objecting to the Owenites, he quoted various
historical examples to show that those societies which had existed under
communal property arrangements had been 'rarely... observed to make
any advance in the arts of production or the accumulation of wealth'.[59]

On the advantages of the division of labour, Scrope, greatly influenced
by Babbage, stressed the economy of time and power 'due to a well
regulated division of labour' and he drew attention to McCulloch's
extension of the concept of the division of labour to include the division
of labour of the mind, as, for instance, when chemistry became separated
from natural philosophy. Scrope was also one of the few to mention
the property of the labourer. Generally, the only property of the labourer
was a little acquired skill. The land, tools and machinery indispensable
to labour and the food that formed the labourer's subsistence were all
appropriated by other classes. This placed the people 'in a precarious
position', and it was in an area like this that the paternalist Scrope saw
a need for government intervention to give protection to the working
class.[60]

_Capital and skill_
The domination of capital even extended to the analysis of skill. In
Senior's Outline of Political Economy knowledge and education were
defined as 'mental capital', the most adaptable form of capital. But the
action of the division of labour in further processing and refining skills
also made them a less fluid form of capital, less able to be transferred
easily between industries and branches of production. 'The skill which

-----

the division of labour gives to each class of artificers prevents the peculiar
dexterity an individual may have from being of any value in a business
to which he has not been brought up.[561] Senior applies his analysis of
capital wholesale to the concept of skill. 'Acquired abilities' were 'fixed
and realized in the person of the possessor . . . The greater part of the
remuneration for skilled labour is the reward for the abstinence implied
by a considerable expenditure on the labourer's education.'[62] The
accumulation of skills was, as Scrope noticed, similar to the accumu-
lation of capital. Skills were taught by actual exhibition and repeated
experiment, and when these skills were passed on from master to pupil
they accumulated the improvements of their various users on the way.
Many progressive innovations had also been developed from 'useful
knowledge', the 'accumulated ability stored in books'.[63]

The acquisition and application of skill in some circles also required
the creation of a separate class of workmen or supervisory capitalists.
As Jones saw it, skill implied creative organisation and required the
creation of a class 'freed from the necessity of mere manual labour',
and 'at liberty to employ their intellect, to facilitate the application of
labour to its task'.[64] In agriculture, capitalist farming would form the
basis for such gains in skill. For the skill of the cultivating class increased
as they were 'freed from the toilsome and absorbing occupations of the
mere labourer, and not distracted by loftier pursuits and more enticing
occupations'. Ultimately, skills would accumulate and there would
be 'an increase in the efficiency of capital employed in cultivation'.[65]

The predominance of capital found its way not only into the analysis
of the division of labour and skill, but even into explanations of inven-
tion. Political economists investigated the social and psychological
motivations behind discovery, and came up with the banal assertion
that inequality was necessary to create an atmosphere of emulation.
The belief in this inequality did not demand adhesion to the classical
class divisions, for the conception of a gradation of ranks suited just
as well. It was argued by some that the major motivation behind
industry was the wish to preserve rank in society. The gradual advance

of the few produced a feeling of emulation.[66] 'Indolence[3] was the pro-
duct either of a 'want of neighbourhood[5] where no extensive gradation
could be established, or the lack of a supply of luxuries: 'if the
acquisition within his reach be lower, he may give way to indolence.
Every improvement in art and skill which renders labour more pro-
ductive, adds to the quantity of labour performed by offering a higher
reward for it.'[67] But inequality would create not only envy but the
necessary 'share of leisure' for the 'cultivation of genius'.[68]

_Man and machine_
The central role given to fixed capital in the 1830s was buttressed by
the analysis of machinery and the accumulation of capital. The occasion
for this analysis was the continued preoccupation with the machinery
and labour question both at the level of practical politics and at the
theoretical level of responding to Ricardo. Senior felt it necessary to
carry out a complete critique of Ricardo's chapter on machinery.
Longfield and Scrope also dealt with the issue in some detail.
Senior, after examining the hypothetical case put forward by Ricardo,
agreed like earlier critics that it was true in principle that the rate of
wages could be reduced by the introduction of machinery. Where
capital was scarce and technical change sudden, the costs of constructing
machinery could create a real setback for labour. Lower wages or
reduced employment would result if labour generally employed in the
consumer goods sector was transferred to the production of capital
goods, and if the latter absorbed commodities otherwise consumed by
labour. But Senior saw little prospect of Ricardo's hypothetical case
ever coming to pass, for the reality was, he argued, that the expense of
machine building was paid out of profits and rent.[69] Longfield, similarly,
gave little credence to Ricardo's example, and simply retorted that in
all practical cases a machine was never introduced unless it led to
lower costs of production.[70]

There were, in the wake of all these attempts to discredit the theoreti-
cal position of the critics of machinery, two political economists who
recognised the existence of technological unemployment. Scrope,
because of his paternalist concern for the poor, conceded that any

sudden change of techniques might lead to problems of occupational
and geographical mobility. A change in the mode of production in
particular industries did lead to the unemployment of those who had
worked with an older method. Labour was not perfectly mobile between
techniques or branches of industry. 'The prejudice against machinery,
still prevalent among the poor and ignorant' was understandable, and
ways had to be found of increasing the mobility of labour.[71] But it was
Jones who went so far as to declare employment to be a limit on the
accumulation of fixed capital. The wages of labour, he pronounced,
had to be kept proportionate to the prosperity of capitalists. Capitalists
could only have momentary advantage in the deprivation of labourers.
The ultimate effect would be a drop in productivity, and a decline in
the security of property : 'The accumulation of large masses of auxiliary
capital cannot go on undisturbed in the midst of a degraded and
turbulent population.[572]

The discussion of capital and machinery in the 1830s and the place
given to them in generalisations about economic development disclosed
a break in ideas about technology between the 1820s and the 1830s.
Where earlier political economists had focussed on the division of labour
they now gave pride of place to fixed capital. The machine came to the
fore in economic thought in the 1830s, but its authority was to be short
lived. For in the late 1840s political economists found a new centre of
attraction in discovering the implications of self-regulating power.
After 1848 the issue with machinery died away, as political economists
and their public submitted to the all-powerful discipline of the physical
forces apparent in steam and other forms of power. The views of Nassau
Senior and Richard Jones were two of the best examples of this shift in
the interests of political economists.
Senior showed interest during the 1830s in the attributes of inanimate
power, but directed his attention mainly to the 'improvement' entailed
by power machinery. He was fascinated by Marsland's Stockport factory
which he reports seeing in 1825. He enthused: 'if the power of directing
inanimate substances, at the same time to exert the most tremendous
energy, and to perform the most delicate operations, be the test, that
dominion and power are nowhere so strikingly shown as in a large
cotton manufactory'.[73] Senior went into some detail describing the
water-power system and the connection of all the shafts in Marsland's

factory. He conceived of power in the same terms in which he thought
of machinery: 'In the operation of machinery, power, like matter,
seems susceptible of indefinite aggregation and of indefinite sub-
division. In the performance of some of its duties the machinery moved
at a rate almost formidable, in others at one scarcely perceptible.[574]

One of Senior's major sources in this discussion was the Report of the
Select Committee on Combination Laws, Artisans and Machinery of
1824, which I will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 9. The Report
gave Senior ample evidence of one essential quality of machinery - its
'susceptibility of infinite improvement'. And it was to cotton machinery
combined with the steam engine that he attributed the major economic
transformation he was living through.

Sixty years form a short period in the history of a nation; yet
what changes in the state of England and the Southern parts
of Scotland have the steam engine and cotton machinery
effected within the last sixty years. They have almost doubled
the population, more than doubled the wages of labour, and
nearly trebled the rent of land.[75]

The position of fixed capital was treated more systematically by
Richard Jones who analysed the development of what he termed
'auxiliary' capital within the general history of capital formation. He
argued that the 'enormous development' of 'aids to human power' had
'created a new era in the history of human industry'.[76] There was, he
pointed out, a constant tendency to the accumulation of auxiliary
capital, that is, continuously improving fixed capital.

Where capital abounds, owners of it are always impelled by self
interest to use the various additions which they employ as much
as possible in the shape of auxiliary capital, and as little as they
can help in the shape of the wages of labour... The gradual
increase of the relative quantity of auxiliary capital is, therefore,
the ordinary effect of the progressive increase of the whole
mass of capital employed in agriculture.[77]

Contrasted to a world view, in which fixed capital was defined as a
material substance which was more durable and efficient than labour

and therefore displaced it, came a new perception expressed in the
1840s. Senior, in his lectures of 1847 gauged that the real triumph was
not with machinery but with inanimate power, particularly that which
began with steam. What distinguished it from all other forms of power
was its 'manageableness' and regularity: 'The engine does all that
requires force. The workman has only to supply it with materials and
to perform the services which being irregular and unforeseen cannot be
obtained from an irrational agent.'[78] The regularity of this force allowed
for greater precision in verifying the quantity of quality of goods so
produced.[79]

Senior now saw that the essential qualities of modern machinery
were force, dexterity, uniformity, and safety.[80] Gone was the interest in
giving material description to fixed capital as machinery. Gone was the
interest in describing the production process as a structure where labour
co-operated with fixed capital, albeit dominated by the 'more superior[5]

capital. Now, attributes of both machinery and labour were derived
from the domination of moving power. This conception of the new
industrial dimension offered by the use of power also prompted Senior
to look into the sophisticated combination of the types of force gener-
ated by hand tools and those based on moving power. Not just steam
power, but tools, had been integral to England's industrial transform-
ation. Tew things in England are so striking to a foreigner as the
abundance and variety of our tools.'[81] Such toolsj combined with power,
produced ever new innovations, such as the adaptation of the simple
hammer to the steam hammer. Moreover, steam, according to Senior,
created the conditions for the introduction of electricity: the railway
provided the long level lines along which wire could be conveniently
extended.[82]

This new attention to power and force was also evident in Richard
Jones's later observations. In an essay, probably written in the late
1840s though it was not published until after his death in 1852, he set
out the influence and growth of mechanical power. Jones made a very
important distinction between force and the mode of applying force, that
is machinery : 'Whatever the moving force,... we can have no measure
of the power with which it is employed in production, unless we are

familiar with the greater or less degree of perfection of the machinery
and implements.[583] Motive force and machinery affected countries dif-
ferently according to their stages of development and endowments. In
England and France he judged that there had been recourse to 'the
higher orders of moving force[5] to such an extent that differences of
mechanical advantage did not have any great impact. In poorer coun-
tries, however, it was not 'moving force[5] but basic implements, tools
and machinery, which made a much greater contribution to efficiency.[84]

Jones even went so far as to analyse the differences in the frequency
and style in invention in the newly significant power technologies.

The discoveries of new moving forces are made rarely and at
considerable intervals; the discovery of new modes of applying
forces already known, by improved machinery and tools, is of
daily occurrence, and facilitates the application of increasing
masses of capital on a much more extensive scale, though in a
less striking manner,... than when such inventions as wind
and water mills, or even steam were in the first instance
applied.[85]

These remarkable visions of the economic future were later to inspire
Marx to write of the automatic mechanical system which dominated
the place of economic development which he formulated as 'modern
industry[5].

_Alternative technologies_
The social and historical view of the origin of fixed capital that inter-
ested political economists in the 1830s also prompted them to look at
alternative technologies, and to assess the conditions which influenced
the advance or development of a particular set of techniques. Scrope
investigated the impact of wage changes under various technical con-
ditions. In the case of a technique using high proportions of fixed
capital and small amounts of labour, a wage rise was likely to have a
minimal effect on profits. In the other case where the proportion of
labour was high, the impact of any change in wages on profits would be
substantial. Scrope also pointed out that capital could be transferred
from a sector dominated by one set of techniques to that dominated by
another. The effect of an influx of capital into the sector dominated

-----

by capital intensive methods would be to reduce the price of its products.
But such a transfer of capital away from labour-intensive production,
in order to escape the impact of high wage claims, would raise the
price of goods produced by labour-intensive techniques. Scrope did
not, however, think that high wage demands would ever actually result
in a large-scale transfer from labour-intensive to capital-intensive pro-
duction. For the rise in wages would also affect the cost of acquiring
machinery. The high costs of switching techniques from labour-intensive
to capital-intensive ones would substantially reduce the level of expected
profits, and thus the motives to change processes and patterns of pro-
duction. Scrope did not, however, make clear the final implication of
this analysis. A disequilibrium in the rate of profit between sectors could
be indefinite.[86]

The comparative and historical approach to economics gave John
Rae a sense of the social determinants of techniques of production : he
came to see that alternative technologies could be developed to suit
different environments. Rae went further and suggested that the
efficiency of techniques was not technically but socially defined. It was
thus he came to distinguish the production conditions of intensive
agriculture from those of extensive cultivation.

An English fanner... who comes to North America to pursue
his art, almost always commences on the system which he
followed in Britain. His agricultural implements, his harness,
his carts and waggons, etc. are all of the most durable and
complete, and therefore, of the most expensive construction,
and his fields are tilled as laboriously and carefully as were those
he cultivated in his native land. Some time usually elapses,
before he discovers that he might do better by being content
with more simple, and less highly finished implements, and
that it will be for his advantage to cultivate ... less laboriously,
though not less systematically. His neighbours tell him indeed
from the first, that if he expects the same profits as they have,
he must have less dead stock on his hands, and must give more
activity to his capital; but he is slow of believing them.[87]

It is true, however, that any notice taken of the choice of techniques was
only to add evidence to the belief that the most capital-intensive tech-
niques in a society dominated by the accumulation of capital indicated

the highest stage of development. George Robertson affirmed the per-
vasive fusion of the accumulation of capital and best practice
techniques: 'By means of an abundant capital, the makers of machinery
likewise are enabled to provide the most suitable materials and the most
expert workmen, for constructing what their employers consider best
calculated for the proper performance of the work in contemplation.'[88]

John Rae, too, connected the social conditions conducive to the
accumulation of capital with those conducive to the invention and
introduction of machinery. Accumulation was helped by these factors:
a concern for the future welfare of society which allowed for programmes
of investment in social overhead capital; intellectual awareness of and
reflection on future needs; and social stability. The motivations for the
introduction and invention of machinery were similar. But Rae did
notice a key exception. As discussed above, few of the political economists
made any distinction between inventors and innovators. Rae, however,
did observe that the distinction mattered. Capital accumulation and
the innovation of techniques suffered from any disturbance in the social
order, but it was precisely this disturbance that stimulated scientific
advance:

Men are so much given to learning, that they do not readily
become discoverers. They have received so much, that they do
not easily perceive the need of making additions to it, or readily
turn the vigour of their thoughts in that direction... What-
ever, therefore, breaks the wonted order of events, and exposes
the necessity or the possibility of connecting them by some
other means, strongly stimulates invention.[89]

Machinery was connected to the accumulation of capital in another
way. John Rae laid bare the social relations generated by their dual
development. It was in the nature of progress to convert the original
simple tools into more complex machinery. 'And so it is with all our
implements, they are passing on to great machines. This process can
be averted by no conceivable process that would not have the effect of
fettering all the active powers of humanity.[390] This raised the question
_cut bono. With the accumulation of capital it was obvious that the_
'former artisans, in giving up their tools have never become the owners

of the machines that have succeeded them'. Rae concluded that
machinery and factories came to be owned by a particular class - 'the
operative . . . owns nothing but his hands and the art of using them
fitly[5]. The artisan was forced to sell his labour to the owner of the
machine and was degraded in social status. 'Formerly he was a small
capitalist, now it is the characteristic of his condition to be a mere
operative, destitute of capital.[591] Rae compared the 'industrious
apprentice[5] to the 'present factory boy[5] and predicted the fate of handi-
craft manufacture after the current 'revolution[5] in industry.[92]

_The savage mind and civil society_
The political economy of the 1830s and early 1840s also had a distinctive
social framework. A remarkable theme running through the writings
of the political economists of the period was the idea of a contrast
between their own economy and that of primitive cultures. The analysis
of technical change and the accumulation of capital was coloured by
images of progress and primitivism, and backed up by the hypothetical
history and anthropological findings of the period. Economists of the
period had a great deal to say about primitive economies, but their
emphasis was on the contrast with industrialised societies and not on
the development of those cultures in themselves.
The role that savages played in early nineteenth-century thought was
perceptively uncovered by one of the colonial reformers, Herman
Merivale. Merivale made telling comment on the uses of savages for
political economists and political philosophers: their culture was 'a
sort of zero in the thermometer of civilization[5], and thus appeared to
give some scientific status to a theory of the gradual rise towards per-
fection. He did not doubt that the model was of value in hypothetical
reasoning, but argued that historically it was false. His own diffusionist
approach reflected the assumption of a great divide between primitive
and modern cultures, or what Levi-Strauss calls 'a level plain between
two ascents[5].[98] 'We do not know a single instance of a savage tribe
raising itself by unassisted efforts to a state of civilization. This has
always been effected by foreign emigration from a more civilized state.[594]

Almost all the theorists discussed in this chapter had implicit social

theories and models of underdevelopment. Senior distinguished savage
man by his lack of abstinence. The savage exercised labour and
providence. But the pre-requisite for a rise from hunting or fishing to
a pastoral, then arable, phase was abstinence.[95] Similarly, Rae produced
the example of the American Indian whose concern for future welfare
was seen in terms of the tribe. In this situation 'prudence and foresight'
could have little effect on the future welfare of the individual. In any
case, the direction of events was obviously beyond the control of the
hunter in the woods.[96] If economists could define modern man on the
basis of his capacity for abstinence, then it is not surprising that they
also defined 'the modern economy[5] in terms of its fixed capital and
machinery. In a savage state labour could acquire only minimal
productivity because of lack of fixed capital. Scrope argued that 'by
practice, and the exercise of his native ingenuity, in . . . fabricating
instruments, a clever savage may increase the productiveness and
reward of his labour far beyond that of his companions'. But this
allowance for some form of advancement was set up by Scrope only as
a contrast to the much better conditions of even the lowest level labourer
in a civilised society. Modern society was distinguished by its accumu-
lation of fixed capital.[97] Scrope also defended the diffusionist view of
civilisation. He found it quite easy to dispose of Whately's platonic
conception that man was created with innate knowledge, and was
unconvinced by his idea that present-day savage tribes were formerly
civilised nations now in a state of deterioration.[98]

The use of the image of the savage to illustrate a social theory of
the accumulation of capital reached its limits in John Stuart Mill's
_Principles. Like the political economists before him he argued that the_
egalitarian structure of savage societies was based on an equality of
poverty and a non-existent rate of capital accumulation. Such peoples
lived exclusively on wild animals; their habitations were made of logs
or the boughs of trees and abandoned at an hour's notice; the food
they used could not be stored. The great advance, he claimed, came
with the domestication of useful animals and the emergence of in-
equality. Mill regarded the origin of such inequality as natural: 'large
flocks and herds are in time possessed by active and thrifty individuals
through their own exertion and by the heads of families and tribes,

through the exertions of those connected with them by allegiance[5].[99]

The tilling of the ground, which was stimulated by population pressure,
created a greater surplus which was taken from the producers by those
who had established themselves as lords of the soil.[100] He cited
Charleroix on the natives of Paraguay and John Rae on the North
American Indians to back up his claims for the inadequacy of fore-
thought, and thus accumulation, among primitive peoples. He also
echoed the old prejudice against the Chinese for the inferior durability
of their 'instruments'.[101] However, unlike his predecessors, Mill went
on to criticise the excessive spirit of accumulation among the European
middle classes. These saved without purpose or forethought for anything
but the process of saving itself.[102]

The savage was also a tool both for those who espoused a social
theory of ranks and those who pretended to a theory of social classes.
Whately drew on the work of the physical anthropologist James Cowles
Prichard and Dr Taylor, and used as his examples the Indians of New
Guinea, the natives of the Pellew Islands and the American Indian. He
postulated a series of gradations between the highest and the lowest
state of human society. He compared the conditions of those on the
bottom rungs of this ladder to 'as low a state as some tribes with which
we are acquainted'. Both were incapable of any improvement by their
own unassisted efforts.[103] As pointed out (p. 129), Hamilton's definition
of primitive culture was expressed as a state lacking distinctions of rank
and fortune, and the force of emulation. Lloyd contrasted the societies
of the Otaheiti and the Hayti to prove that the inequality of property
encouraged the production of luxuries and conveniences.[104] But he
revealed the essential class nature of the production process in a way no
other economist of the period did. He made very little of the difference
between free labour and slavery : 'Whether the system of free labour or
of slavery be established, we may equally find a class of society enjoying,

104 As far back as the 1750s, Turgot had made similar arguments. He
believed that inequality was the necessary precondition for the

accumulation of capital. See Ronald Meek, Social Science and the

without personal labour, the necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries of
life, and another class performing the labour requisite for purchasing
these necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries at the hands of nature.'[105]

This analogy between the exploitation of capitalist and slave societies
was tempered by the attempt to discover which form of exploitation
was most favourable to growth. The case that slave labour was more
inefficient than free was a part of the armoury of the humanitarian
cause in the anti-slavery debates. Scrope developed this form of argu-
ment using Richard Jones's work on types of agricultural labour. It was
his characterisation of the cottier that

Poverty, the constant fatigues of laborious exertion, and the
grasping blindness of his landlord, put both science and the
means of assisting his industry by the accumulation of capital
out of reach of the peasant. And from the landowners them-
selves it is vain to hope for either much steady superintendence
of cultivation, or the accumulation of capital. They are not a
saving class.[106]

Scrope later went on to trace the different patterns of development
between the East and the West. The pattern of land occupation con-
stituted the basic difference, and from this he traced the slow shift from
serfdom to free tenancy, the object of which was to 'encourage the
industry' of the cultivator by guaranteeing 'some return for his
efforts'.[107] This transition from servitude to free labour was achieved by
force, but liberty and pauperism grew up together. Scrope blamed the
contradiction on the management of the Poor Laws, which was left to
the magistracy and landed groups, precisely those elements which had
an interest in keeping wages low and rents high. He accused them of
'forcibly metamorphosing the whole labouring population into
paupers'.[108]

Political economy in the early 1830s gathered together the strands
of thought defining civil society. This was the most advanced form of
society developing over time, and acted as the cocoon for the protection
and nourishment of fixed capital. It was the assumption of political
economy that the historically unprecedented role of fixed capital was
socially determined by a class structure and ideologically extended by
the state. Read, Hamilton and Rae all limited the role of the state to

paving the way to new inventions and new ways of acquiring fixed
capital.
The sources for these images of past and primitive societies are not
difficult to locate. J. W. Burrow blamed the contemporary lack of
understanding of the alien and the primitive on the narrowness of
utilitarianism and political economy, which produced an atmosphere
of dogmatism. But the situation was more complicated than this. For,
increasingly throughout this period, there was direct contact with the
problems of alien cultures, and greater interest in collecting data to
reinterpret concepts of society and social change.[109] Political economists
were taking their examples, not only from history and the contemporary
accounts of other European economies, but also from the data of the
slavery debates and from early anthropological writings.
The more historical approach of political economists in this period
recalls the social theories of Adam Smith and other writers of the
Scottish Enlightenment. Many of these writers ascribed to a theory of
progress in which the economy advanced through a series of stages,
with savagery and barbarism as the lowest. They believed in the posi-
tive development of humanity and ascribed the superiority of contem-
porary European society to the existence of certain important socio-
economic institutions and phenomena such as property rights, inequality,
and the accumulation of capital.[110]

The stages theory was developed and adapted by the nineteenth-
century inheritors of the Scottish tradition. James Mill made overt use
of these philosophical principles to write his History of India. Mill
ranked cultures by their achievements, and had great contempt for
'degenerate' Hindu society.[111] He also believed that Africa illustrated
the earlier stages through which India had passed.[112] The comparative
and historical analysis of many of the economic theorists of the 1830s
also owed much to the Scottish tradition. Many of these theorists, like
James Mill, had been educated in the Scottish universities, and had
attended the lectures of Dugald Stewart.[113]

This apparent continuity between eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
ideas would seem to contradict Burrow's case for the death of con-
jectural history and the Scottish mode of thought at the end of the
eighteenth century. But, in fact, for a host of reasons not mentioned by
Burrow, intellectual conditions from the 1790s radically altered the
Scottish legacy.
Another source for the developmental social framework of political
economists of this period was the emerging discipline of anthropology.[114]

From the 1830s onwards anthropology was feeling the impact of a
re-orientation in the life sciences and geology, which, in turn, were
becoming infused with a historical perspective. This was completed in
the latter half of the nineteenth century with the entry of the theory of
evolution.[115] It is striking, however, that the critique of Ricardo in the
1830s was developing in its method and approach along very similar
lines to developments in anthropology and the life sciences. Scrope was
only an ideal example of the connection between the disciplines. His
geological work has been credited with laying the basis for Lyell's
_Principles. Scrope generalised a new idea of time and evolutionary_
change, and his demonstration of the progressive stages in the develop-
ment of the earth's surface were compatible with his views on the
historical development of capitalist society :

Just as the causation of geological events, however unusual,
was referable to the ordinary laws of nature, so Scrope
believed that the most effective political economy would be
one based on the 'natural laws' of social welfare ... Just as
the general 'invariability' of the laws of nature was in no way
contravened by demonstrating that the earth had 'passed
through several progressive stages of existence in the past',
so the detection of laws of social behaviour was compatible

**114 Little of the writing about Africa in the early years of the nineteenth**

with an optimistic outlook for the future progress of mankind.
And at the deepest level, just as Scrope wished his geology to
demonstrate the overall providential design behind the law
bound progressiveness of the earth's history, so also he wished
his political economy to vindicate the providential character of
the world of human affairs by refuting the gloomy predictions
of the Malthusians.[116]

Ideas of the development of primitive economies were culled from
the prevailing attitudes in ethnography and travel literature. As
Gellner puts it, what dominated was a theory of primitive mentality as
steeped in intellectual error.[117] Nineteenth-century thinkers had an
evolutionist vision of continuous growth, and used the contemporary
primitive culture as a fossil of their own society.
The correspondence between the historical perspectives of political
economists and those of the life scientists and anthropologists indicates
a wider intellectual context for the economists' models of progress and
capital accumulation. It does not, however, tell us about the social and
political issues in which political economists intervened so vigorously.
The appeal to anthropology was a way of writing political economy
which, along with other factors, gave it a more scientific posture. The
volume of scholarly work on the savage gave scientific status to a theory
of the gradual rise towards the perfection of industrial capitalism. Ear-
lier sections of this chapter have indicated the extent to which the
economists' emphasis on the capacity for abstinence and the role of
fixed capital was predicated on their desire to defend industrialisation
against socialist critics and prejudices against the machine. But the
image of the savage in the work of these and other social theorists had
a definite ideological setting in contemporary attitudes towards the poor
and labour.
There was, for instance, a definite analogy, current in the work of
social reformers, between the savage and the poor and unemployed.[118]

and urban degeneracy endemic to industrialism. Neither of these, how-
ever, challenged the industrial system; they, too, echoed support for
the introduction of machinery.[119] Certainly, as well, the social reformer
found his kinfolk among the missionaries to Africa and Asia, and among
the scientists who encouraged them.
This social analogy between savages and the outcasts of advanced
industrial society was, however, only the surface of much deeper
concerns within political economy. I have shown how, for many of
these economists, the savage represented a type of 'fossil' to nineteenth-
century British culture. These economists had distinguished the savage
by his lack both of abstinence and of the institutions of private property.
But the idea of the savage also went alongside a definite change in
ideas about labour in an industrial system. Just as the savage was
regarded as a relic, so now was the ingenious artisan. John Rae traced
with regret the transformation of the artisan into a 'mere operative'.
These theorists saw the first transition, in their own time, of vital aspects
of the work process. The new face of technical change was fixed capital
and machinery. The labour that went with this was not that of the
craftsman, but that of the factory hand. Some, indeed, feared explosive
consequences from this process. Hamilton noted that the complex
division of labour entailed by technical change had made workers
increasingly inflexible and had gathered them together in large
factories, full of sophisticated machinery. This labour was now simply
the appendage of machinery, but its concentration allowed a basis for
political organisation. The result, he predicted, was that in such a
setting any sudden introduction of new fixed capital which substituted
for human labour would create struggle in the factory and lead to the
'destruction of machinery[9].[120]

This change in the idea of labour was also reflected in middle-class
attitudes to workers' education. I will say much more of this in Chapter
7 on the Mechanics Institute Movement. Suffice it to say that these
early campaigns for an appropriate vocational education had their
counterpart in plans for the training of 'savages'. Policy makers and
reviewers in the late 1830s and 1840s were demanding instruction in

agriculture and the mechanical arts for the African natives. But this
was to be only an adequate education for an inferior people: it was
proposed that industrial training be limited to such an extent that
Africans should be taught to repair, but not to manufacture, the
industrial products of England. Education was to consist of religious
instruction along with agriculture for boys, and domestic science for
girls. Its object was to provide a docile workforce. The children were
to be 'taught habits of self control and moral discipline'. They were to
be instructed in 'the mutual interests of the mother-country and her
dependencies; the rational basis of their connection, and the domestic
and social duties of the coloured races'. Their education in economics
and politics was to include 'the relation of wages, capital and labour,
and the influence of local and general government on personal security,
independence, and order'.[121]

On the British scene, the mere operative and the factory hand were
concepts proceeding out of a political economy which gave an unpre-
cedented role to the abstaining capitalist and predicted gains from
greater capitalist control of the production process. A more detailed
examination of the role of the 'mere operative' took place in the context
of the scientific movement. The promotion of Mechanics Institutes to
provide a practical education for workers developed a rhetoric from
the early 1820s to the early 1840s in a way which paralleled the shifts
of emphasis in political economy over the same period. The changing
attitudes to labour reflected in this rhetoric were complemented by new
concerns at a grass-roots level with industrial management and labour
discipline. The scientific movement carried the debate on the definition
and significance of skills in the context of the machine age to broader
audiences. The writers of management manuals and technological
histories on the margins of this movement gained an enormous
popularity for their attempts to deal with the practical problems of
workshop and factory. It is to them and not to the political economists,
therefore, that we must now look for ideas on the implementation of
capitalist control of the production process through the organisation
and pace of work, and the redefinition and breakdown of skills.

###### PART THREE A SCIENCE OF MACHINERY

# 7

###### The scientific movement

Economists of the 1820s and 1830s welded their perceptions of the
advance of technology to their concepts of economic development. But
what they accomplished did not have implications for only the theoretical
sphere of political economy. It reached beyond political economy to a
far-reaching cultural sphere which took up the machinery question in
political economy's terms and made a doctrine of technological progress.
This cultural sphere was the scientific movement. The early nineteenth-
century scientific movement was also to link the perception of tech-
nology to the promotion of economic improvement. The scientific
movement formed the meeting point between the popular discipline of
political economy and an extensive underworld of popular science.[1]

This movement became an important avenue for the dissemination of
vulgarised forms of political economy to the middle and working classes,
for in it was assumed an ideology of economic growth in the technological
vision which characterised the scientific culture of the time. The study
of the economy met the study of science.
This chapter will move on from the analysis of political economy's
perception of the machine to the analysis of the images of technological

advance conjured up in the scientific movement. It will do this by
examining in detail the tracts and societies of the Mechanics Institute
Movement, and by demonstrating complementary concerns in the
British Association for the Advancement of Science. Furthermore, this
chapter will establish the material basis of this social context by linking
the rhetoric and purpose of the Mechanics Institute Movement directly
to concerns about the structure of the labour market.
The Mechanics Institute Movement reflected the desires among
middle-class ideologues to improve the understanding of the connections
between the advances of technology and the doctrines of political
economy. A literature which brought together ideologies of economic
and technological advance had obvious social connotations for its
middle- and working-class audience. Popularisers found support for
their doctrines of social harmony in rising productivity and advances in
technology. The machine and the practical implementation of the
division of labour were to bring the capitalist and the worker together,
to the ultimate benefit of all. The ascription of utilitarian and commer-
cial value to scientific and technological endeavour goes back to much
earlier times, finding its immediate ancestor in the eighteenth-century
literary and scientific society. The assignment of 'usefulness[5] by con-
temporaries to science and technology need not of itself imply any
specific connection with the economy. This connection, however, was
apparent in the Mechanics Institute Movement. The Machinery
Question created the basis for a connection between the economy and
technology; the Mechanics Institute Movement had specific aims which
linked the advance of science and technology with the structure of the
labour market.
The Mechanics Institute Movement was initially built up on the
basis of a passionate concern among middle-class reformers for providing
a scientific education for the artisan, but these goals changed as the
movement evolved. It has already been demonstrated that political
economy between the 1830s and 1840s had become increasingly con-
cerned with charting a programme for the progress of wealth, which was
contingent not on the genius but on the discipline of the labour force.
Political economists drew attention, as the period progressed, to the
precision, regularity and standardisation constantly pressing on
industry. However, these demands for both an ingenious artisan and a
disciplined labour force were not contradictory. For the ingenious
artisan which the Mechanics Institute Movement aspired to create was
in fact functionally identified with demands for a newly adaptable

labour force and with the hardening of social hierarchies within the
work process.
The founding programmes and the organisation of the Mechanics
Institutes in their early years were very different from those of later
stages in the movement's development. The movement was composed
of a myriad of local societies whose structures and constitutions varied
widely. Most of the institutes, however, contained within themselves a
tension between middle-class patrons and the desired working-class
subscribers. This tension was in turn related like the rhetoric to the
concern with developing a labour market suitable to an industrialising
society.
In the London Mechanics Institute the early ascendancy of Place,
Brougham and Birkbeck established patronage and control by middle-
class subscribers.[2] But the story of the London Mechanics Institute was
not that of all the provincial institutes, for these took shape under their
own local social circumstances.[8] Members of provincial elites took an
active role in the formation of many, ceding more or less than the two-
thirds control to ordinary members as recommended by Brougham.
The Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Ashton-under-Lyne, and
Nottingham Institutes were started up and controlled by whig-liberal
elites.[4] The Manchester Institute was one of solid middle-class control,
and Benjamin Heywood, the banker, made no bones about this when
rebuking Brougham for his criticism of the system of management. He
stressed that the Mechanics Institute had not been formed in obedience
to any call on the part of the mechanics, but had originated with the
employers. It was a philanthropic effort on the part of the employers
to place within the reach of their workmen 'the means of improvement'.[5]

Birmingham's institute was more problematic. It is true that a leading
part was taken by Joseph Parkes, a well known philosophic radical,[6]

but, equally, Parkes could report in 1826 that the institute was not
supported by the more educated classes. The fact that the constitution
was in the hands of the members had 'given great offence to the higher
classes[5].[7] The Institute was also strongly influenced by the Birmingham
co-operator, W. Hawkes Smith.
Birmingham's case was not unique, and it is important not to forget
both the tradition of 'mutual improvement' in working-class culture and
the strong scientific tradition in nineteenth-century radicalism. Those
who set up the Glasgow Gasworkmen's Library in 1823 stressed equality
and culture. The pre-eminence of the few could only be broken down by
measures to alleviate the ignorance and poverty of the many. The value
of science was cultural: 'Even in our workshops and manufactures will
we find many who are little better than parts of the machines around
them'.[8] Hawkes Smith claimed the rights of the 'ingenious population'
to be instructed in the sciences in general, and not simply in those rela-
ted to their occupations. He also pointed to the possibilities for the
equalisation of education.

When the steam engine was perfected, half the external
distinctions of rank vanished; - the new power rendering
manufactured articles more accessible. But the effects of
scientific advancement will not be branded by the cheapening
of silks, calicoes and hardwares. There is an intellectual
machinery, a mental steam power at work, and still rising in its
action which renders education proportionately as cheap and
as attainable to the man of small means as his clothing and his
domestic appointments.[9]

This pattern was typical of institutes founded by artisans themselves.
They sought personal and educational advantages in the context of
co-operation in the pursuit of knowledge. The institutes at Keighley,
Halifax and Bradford, Stalybridge, Bolton and Hyde, and Kendal,

Morpeth and Birmingham were all founded by artisans and in some way
carried the banner of 'mutual instruction'.[10]

Just as organisation and management differed according to local
circumstances, so the justifications, programmes and ideas proposed in
the movement all expressed local pecularities. However, from the
plethora of introductory addresses to a wide range of institutes, the
statements of various mechanics' journals, and a number of reports on
the progress of the movement, it is possible to delineate the outline of
a composite picture of themes and images.
The declared aims and principles of most of the institutes invoked
some combination of three assumptions. The first was that the pro-
gramme offered by the institutes would foster egalitarianism and social
mobility, the second that skill and science both in some way contributed
to industry, and the third that technical change occurred in a piecemeal
and empirical fashion. The combination of these assumptions fostered
the views that the industrial transformation the country was experienc-
ing was conducive to harmony and stability, and that science was merely
an appendage of technological knowledge. Harmonious expansion and
technological knowledge embedded in the empirical skills of the artisan
appeared to project a vision of a labour market stamped by hierarchical
divisions and social mobility. The entrepreneurs of the movement viewed
science as a type of superior technical knowledge which, when added
to the empirical skills of certain highly placed groups of workers, would
generate all kinds of technological and economic improvements. Most
of the founders of the movement hoped for some optimal combination
of 'science' and skill. The implication they had in mind for such a
combination was the creation of a higher form of skilled labour, one
freed from the degradation of the division of labour and imbued with
creative and innovative instincts. James Hole's view, though stated
much later, did sum up the outlook of the earlier period: 'The nation
which possesses the largest number of skilled artisans, capable of avail-
ing themselves of the aids which science lends to industry, will, . . . be
the richest nation.'[11]

But the founders were anxious to stress that science did have some
direct connection with technology. At its most extreme, this was voiced
in the view that the origins of the steam engine were to be traced to
Black's research into the nature and properties of latent heat, with

Watt's discoveries as but a logical extension of this.[12] Brougham's views
at the outset were also somewhat extreme and untypical. He stressed
that few great discoveries were made by chance and by ignorant
persons - that Watt's discoveries were based on a learned investigation
of mathematics, mechanics and chemistry, and that even Arkwright had
devoted five years to the invention of the 'spinning jenny' and was
conversant with everything that related to the construction of
machinery.[13] Most of the provincial institutes simply drew a loose con-
nection between science and the artisan. According to the Darlington
Institute, the knowledge of science would 'acquaint them [the working
classes] with more certain rules than the mere imitation of what they
have seen done by another', and there was 'no trade which does not
depend more or less, upon scientific principles'.[14]

James Hole's statement of the relations between science and industry
was much the more common one. Such an attitude often involved a
mystical view of the artisan. The imitation and instinct of a machine
or 'Indian weaver' were often contrasted to the innovative spirit of the
educated artisan. The institutes by 'adding knowledge to your industry
and skill', would lead to 'rich veins of practical talent' being 'brought
to light'.[15] The imitative behaviour of the Indian weaver whose process
had remained the same for centuries was contrasted with the observant
mind of a Hargreaves. Changes were brought about by observation
followed by inquiry involving the principles of science.[16] Aside from
this Baconian view of the advance of science on the basis of the number
of educated artisans, there was also the view of science as a cultural
antidote to the division of labour. James Hole quoted Lyon Playfair to
support his view that the division of labour had been carried to extremes.
He saw science as a 'synthesis of labour', or 'the bringing together the
knowledge required in each department of industry'.[17] Science was to

be 'injected[5] into the workshops, and men daily employed in handling
tools and working amongst the elements of mechanical science would be
the best suited to making discoveries and inventing improvements.
Brougham singled out Watt as the model to the members of the institutes.
He saw it as 'their own fault[5] if they did not 'rise out of their level[5] and
'take the chances of making discoveries which would secure them
affluence and the fame of extending the boundaries of science and art[5].[18]

Brougham used his opportunities to point out that ingenious models
and apparatus were frequently brought forward 'by persons from whom
little beyond ordinary handicrafts would have been expected[5].[19] The
_Glasgow Mechanics Magazine advised workmen to keep a pencil and_
notebook while at their work to record observations and ideas. There
was also no lack of schemes for patent protection of artisan inventors.
The Wakefield Mechanics Institute included assistance, when funds
would permit, to members for the patenting of any useful inventions
they might make.[20] The Mechanics Magazine in 1825 announced steps
towards the formation of a joint stock company, 'The British Invention
and Discovery Company for the Assistance, Encouragement and
Protection of Native Genius, and the Profitable Investment of Capital
in the Prosecution of Original Inventions and Discoveries by British
Subjects[5].[21]

This combination of science and industry was a mythical one. There
was rarely any attempt to specify the connections or to test the models
and folk heroes put forward. The combination was, however, closely
connected with the social ideals of the movement. In one sense the
'artisan inventor[5] was a direct challenge to the aristocracy of theory.
Discovery was to become an everyday employment, and not an 'exclusive
philosopher's right'. As late as 1837, the President of the Bradford
Mechanics Institute could exclaim: 'Who can tell but that some happy
thought, suggesting itself to the mind of an hitherto obscure member of
a Mechanics Institute, may pave the way to results, far surpassing in
splendour and usefulness those which the genius of a Watt, a Boulton,
or an Arkwright has achieved.[522] There may, indeed, have been a sense

in which the empiricist approach of the movement was political. The
inductivist movement during this period was a challenge to the
theoretical enclaves of metropolitan science and classical political
economy. However, it is important to note that the challenge to the
exclusiveness of intellect was a very measured one. Much of the verbiage
was aimed at a particular type of workman: the practical man was to
hold the key place in the development of industry, but the 'mechanic'
the institutes envisaged was a new type of workman evolved by the
methods of industry itself. The heroes of the movement were not typical
London artisans. The 'new race of philosophers' was a particular corps
within the working class which was made up of the new technical
workers of the Industrial Revolution. When reference was made to 'the
ingenious artisan' what was envisaged was the new engineering worker.
The Mechanics Institute Movement was organised not around equality
but around hierarchical divisions within the labour market. The engin-
eering industry itself, from which the movement took much of its
rhetoric and example, well illustrated these divisions. The many
differentiated skills which had recently arisen within the engineering
industry were the result of a successful subdivision of the work. In the
eighteenth-century, engineering skills had been integrated in the person
of an all-round skilled craftsman, the old corn millwright and early
millwright engineer. Though his craft was highly exclusive - one had
to be 'born and bred a millwright' in order to gain entry to the trade -
it was also the wide-ranging one of the jack-of-all-trades.[28] With the
emergence of new factory millwork and the early steam engine came a
new demand for millwrights, and with it a two-edged process of level-
ling of craft skill and professionalisation. When Smeaton established the
Society of Civil Engineers in 1771, he complained, 'Not only are all
the inferior departments ambitious to become practical engineers, but
even members of the committee have a propensity that way too - by
which means all becoming masters and he who ought to be so being
deprived of authority, it is easy to see the confusion that must follow.'[24]

Professionalisation of some members of the trade was established
through membership in the Smeatonian Society, and education in the
Dissenting Academies.[25]

The introduction of the Boulton and Watt steam engine brought the

emergence of the 'trouble shooting' Boulton and Watt engine erector
in the late eighteenth century to early nineteenth century. The intro-
duction of the steam engine brought new demands for millwork, but it
'nevertheless lowered the profession of the millwright and levelled it
in a great degree with that of the ordinary mechanic'.[26] Fairbairn
described the history of the training up of workmen in the early
engineering industry, then the gradual removal of their skills. Accurate
fittings could not be secured as long as manufacture was conducted by
hand. The introduction of new tools brought greater precision, but in
addition, 'the facilities these afforded led to a constant progressive
improvement in the character of the work done, at the same time
constantly reducing the dependence on mere manual skill'.[27]

By the 1820s and 1830s there was a broadly based skilled hierarchy
of engineering workers in the engineering plants of the Midlands and
the North. The high degree of specialisation is depicted by the work
force of Peel, Williams & Co., which by the early 1820s included at
the least a principal engineer, draughtsmen, head clerks, engineers,
millwrights, patternmakers, fitters, turners, moulders in brass and iron,
and boilermakers.[28] With the breakdown of the craft and job special-
isation there emerged new closely knit and separate trade societies. One
finds in 1824 the establishment of the Steam Engine Makers' Society, in
1826 the Society of Journeymen Steam Engine Machine Makers and
Millwrights, and in 1830 the Associated Fraternity of Iron Forgers.
The division of labour and hierarchy of skills in the engineering
industry was created in the context of new large-scale capitalist enter-
prises. By the 1820s and 1830s James Nasmyth, James Fox, Matthew
Murray, Sharp, Roberts & Co., Hicks, Hargreaves & Co., Fairbairn and
Iillie, and Joseph Whitworth were directing large-scale machine shops,

foundries and engine factories in the Midlands and the North.[29] With
the appearance of this corps of industrial magnates at the pinnacle of
the industry came professionalisation. The professional and proletarian
created parallel organisations as the mental and manual distinctions of
the trade became formalised. But, like the trade societies, the professional
bodies were exclusive and hierarchically organised according to age. The
exclusive Smeatonian Society was first challenged in 1818 with the
emergence of a new Institute for Givil Engineers which included those
engaged in public works and transport. New reasons for professional-
isation were devised. The society was to provide a forum for reading
practical papers and for assigning professional status. H. R. Palmer,
in opening it, argued:[ c]An engineer is a mediator between the philo-
sopher and the working mechanic, and, like an interpreter between
two foreigners, must understand the language of both . . . Hence the
absolute necessity of possessing both practical and theoretical know-
ledge.'[30] Similarly, such professional status was given to railway engin-
eers with the emergence in 1846 of the Institute of Mechanical
Engineers, so that[ c]by a mutual exchange of ideas regarding improve-
ments in the various branches of Mechanical Science', they might
'increase their knowledge and give impulse to mechanical Inventions
likely to be useful to the World'.[81]

The history of the engineering industry was used as a paradigm to
substantiate the arguments of the Mechanics Institute Movement for a
division of labour, specialisation, and gradations of skill within the
labour market. The movement reinforced these developments by widen-
ing the gap between skilled workers and common labourers, and it
focussed on the highly skilled sector of the working class, giving formal
recognition to the emerging gradations and hierarchies in the labour
force. One of the aims of the movement appeared to be to promote the
role of the skilled labourer, and to increase the supply of this labour.
But in so doing it ignored the historical breakdown of skills even within
these 'privileged' groups. The 'skilled labourer' in this period acquired
new class connotations not just in terms of the technical characteristics
of the various skills but in social terms. As against the type of social
mobility inherent in the old craftsmanship tradition, the new paradigm
was a separation between the skilled and the unskilled in the working

classes, and a split between both and the middle classes. This conscious-
ness of separate classes is aptly characterised by one of Benjamin
Heywood's remarks in 1837, when he described the workmen of Sharp,
Roberts & Co. as 'of the first class as regards skill and rather high wages[5].
One learns more of his perception of the social status of these work-
men, however, from his complaint which follows, 'it would be well if
their habits corresponded with their skill'.[32] The founders of the Mech-
anics Institute Movement made constant appeals to social mobility,
but these appeals were in contradiction to the role it was simultaneously
playing, of creating new social barriers between groups within the
working class, and of limiting the mobility of labour into the middle
classes.
This process was inadvertently borne out by some of the rhetoric of
the movement. The first provisional committee of the London
Mechanics Institute defined as mechanics all who earned their living
by the work of their hands, but included the proviso that if the institute
became overcrowded, preference would be given to those in the trades
who worked for daily, weekly or quarterly wages.[33] The successful
Mechanics Institute in effect as well as idea was seen to act as a labour
exchange for superior workmen. Heywood claimed that many members
of the Manchester Mechanics Institute had been 'raised in the conditions
of life'. 'Masters wanting superior workmen, foremen or overlookers,
are beginning to come here to inquire.'[34] Brougham, also, stressed the
pecuniary benefits of scientific instruction, and was at no loss for
examples of the great engine makers 'taking men of humble rank for
important posts because of their knowledge of science'.[35] Apostles spoke
of the 'getting up of a new aristocracy - an aristocracy of science, com-
posed exclusively of the working orders, which is to be the enemy and
ruler of the old'.[36] The Mechanics Institutes were seen as a way of

T H E SPIRAL OF SUCCESS
Let us, therefore, place the universal good - the object of every
man's ambition — the grand desideratum of all, as a centre, around
which a spiral, in the form of a volute, or pyrotechnical wheel, of
fifteen revolutions, should be drawn. At the extreme point the
work house should be fixed. The radius from it should be described
by the figure of a man, at the bisection of each revolution, to
represent the head of every class in society. The internal orbicular
lines should be filled up with the different classes, shaded down-
wards in proportion to their relative situations or stations in life.
We will, therefore, place the king on the inner circle.
The ministers of state on the second.
The members of the House of Peers on the third.
The members of the House of Commons on the fourth.
The heads of professions, professors of the universities, judges,
first rate merchants, generals, Braham, Talma, Keen on the fifth.
First class barristers, aspiring to be judges; colonels, looking for
the rank of general, etc. on the sixth.
The seventh should contain middle class barristers, captains etc.
The eighth lieutenants etc.
The ninth, mechanics, and others, earning more than forty
shillings a week.
The tenth, mechanics and others earning between twenty shillings
and forty shillings.
The eleventh, those who earn less than twenty shillings.
The twelfth, labourers who earn more than twelve shillings.
The thirteenth, labourers who earn less than twelve shillings.
The fourteenth, paupers, having casual relief only.
The fifteenth, paupers in the work house
The best informed and the most industrious will always, in their
exertion to get forward, thrust out the more ignorant in the
rear.. . .
If diagrams of the kind described were suspended in Mechanics
Institutions, and every member were furnished with them, they
would stir up a spirit of emulation, and have a marked effect on
society.

meeting the social change following from scientific advancement. It was
recognised that the effect of the introduction of new technology would
be the displacement of labour. But though machinery might reduce the
role of unskilled labour in the production process, it might also generate
a greater significance and technical expertise. Economic expansion
would now depend on a labour force which was more polarised and
more hierarchic in its social organisation. It was with this in mind that
James Martineau, an engineer who therefore represented such technical
expertise, spoke to the Liverpool Mechanics Institute of machinery
'rapidly supplanting human labour and rendering mere muscular force
... worthless ... That natural machine, the human body, is depreciated
in the market. But if the body have lost its value, the mind must get
into business without delay.[937] His was a new world where 'Mechanical
invention, and not mere labour, is the great source of national wealth'.[38]

The hierarchy of labour found vivid expression in Richard Burnet's
spiral of success (see pp. 156-7). The spiral of success traced out the
position of all in society, and was kept moving by the social assumption
that the best informed and most industrious always moved forward
by thrusting out the more ignorant. The spiral was based on the concept
of society as a system of ranks, 'Rank keeps the labouring classes from
combining into a whole[5],[89] but rank too implied the idea of duty in
order to relate ranks divided by huge inequalities of wealth and privi-
lege in a framework of mutual obligation.[40] Burnet suggested his spiral
be displayed in all Mechanics Institutes in order to stir up a spirit of
emulation.[41] But even the unprecedented position of this new class of
scientific and technical workers was to be limited. The assumption of
a strict distinction between employer and employed was seldom
challenged by middle-class founders. Leonard Horner stressed that his
School of Arts was to 'give some select instruction to the mechanics in
those branches of science which will be of use to them in the exercise
_of their trade . . . to give them education suited to their circumstances'._
He maintained that there must be 'master mechanics in the direction
of the institutes to prevent anything being done contrary to the habits

and feelings of the workmen'.[42] This reality of the appeal to a hierarchy
of skilled labourers was directly at variance with much of the mythology
of the movement. The founders generally held fast to the image of the
humble inventor and made much of the spectacular success story.
But there was one at least who challenged the conception of innate
workshop genius.

The mechanics of Great Britain can claim no merit as mere
workmen, which every machine in the country may not claim
just as well... Not a class of men can be mentioned, whose
avocations place them more in the way of those discoveries by
which the arts and sciences are improved, and the resources of
a country augmented; it is their constant business, in fact, to
be making those changes in material substances by which their
capabilities are best developed; and yet where are the great
discoveries in art or science, that can be fairly traced to the
observations of the workshop ? ... by far the greatest number
of those discoveries... by which even the arts themselves have
been improved... have been made out of the workshop.**

There was some attempt to tone down the success stories in a later
period. It was said of the mechanical drawing and chemistry classes
that 'if from such classes does not spring a James Watt, or a Christopher
Wren, a Simpson or a Davey, yet from them come supervisors of rail-
way works, foremen of foundries and machine makers[5] establishments,
and "clerks of the works" at the erection of great public buildings'.[44]

And a witness to the Select Committee on Arts and Manufactures
argued that ten years of experience of the institutes had produced some
social mobility, as well as 'more skilful constructors, more ready contri-
vers, more expert workmen, and more tasteful designers'.[45] Commen-
tators also touched a constant source of anxiety - the difficulties of
diffusing new techniques. It was claimed that the operative had a
conservative outlook on the work process because he mechanically

followed rules laid down for him and became attached to a certain
way of working. This was part of the explanation of 'why improvements
are so ill received among the working class of society'.[46] The artisans
with a scientific education would be creative, innovative and perceptive
to the introduction of new techniques. The more realistic claims that
the Mechanics Institute Movement produced greater numbers of
skilled and adaptable workmen were in keeping with the actual role it
played in creating new social and economic hierarchies. These
hierarchical aims were reinforced by the other purpose of the Mechanics
Institute Movement, to act as an instrument of social discipline.
Moral virtue was an intrinsic part of the ideology of science for the
working man. Industry and temperance were the virtues of the good
mechanic. Benjamin Heywood expressed the middle-class fears of
anarchy in the heart of the metropolis.

Living as they do in the midst of a dense and teeming
population, I'm thoroughly persuaded that the best and easiest
method which they can adopt for obviating the risks necessarily
incidental to such a state of society, is by diffusing... sound
and useful knowledge... which imparts those principles in
which are ever to be found the safest guides for individual
conduct, and the surest guarantee of public order.[47]

These concerns led to emphasis on the moral advantages of knowledge.
Education was 'to rouse the mental activity', to 'teach them [the poorer
classes] the acute discernment of their best interests'. The Mechanics
Institutes were, to 'fit men more wisely to direct their own conduct in
whatever situation they may be placed in society'.[48] They would direct
the habits of the working class to 'respect for the laws' and 'that due

subordination of rank on which the well being of every gradation in
society depends'.[49]

This concentration on morality was another point of entry for political
economy. Political economy was an important influence on the move-
ment from its inception, and this influence grew stronger over the years,
particularly after the first decline of the movement in the late 1820s.

_Political economy for mechanics_
It was, in fact, always taken for granted that a certain type of political
economy should be taught in the Mechanics Institutes. Political economy
had become the peculiar creed of the middle classes; it justified claims
to middle-class superiority and offered a millennial picture. The great
work of popularisation began in the 1820s: political economy was
presented as a science which would explain the triumph of British in-
dustry and British economic supremacy. Popularisations displayed the
natural laws by which the economy and society operated, explained all
social problems in terms of the violation of these laws, and encouraged
the view that submission to the laws led to infinite progress. The
supreme concern of this popular political economy was with the prob-
lems of production, and, 21s a corollary of this, the absolute benefit of
machinery.[50] The Mechanics Institutes were thus a natural place for the
interests of political economy.
The Mechanics Institutes were generally left in the hands of the
popularisers. They did, however, attract the patronage of certain key
figures in the establishment of economic theory. McCulloch discussed
the place of the Mechanics Institutes in his Principles of Political
_Economy. He claimed that they gave the working classes an opportunity_
to perfect themselves by learning the principles on which their arts
depended.

The lustre which now attaches to the names of Arkwright and
Watt may be dimmed, though it can never be wholly effaced,
by the more numerous, and, it may be, more important dis-
coveries that will, at no distant period, be made by those who
would have passed ... in the same obscure and beaten track

as by their unambitious ancestors, had not the education now
so generally diffused, served to elicit and ripen the seeds of
genius.[51]

The reviewer of his Discourse on the Rise . . . of Political Economy
suggested the pamphlet for use in the Mechanics Institutes where the
artisans 'learned things far more difficult and less interesting every
day', and he did not doubt that 'when the doctrine of wages and popu-
lation is clearly explained at these institutes, they will be eagerly listened
to'.[52] By 1829,[ a] mutual instruction class at the London Institute was
using McCulloch's Principles™ McGulloch also gave the introductory
address to the London Literary and Scientific Institute, formed for
lower-middle-class clerks. The committee included businessmen and
political economists, among them John Smith M.P., James Mill, C. P.
Thomson, William Ellis, Alexander Baring and S. Jones Loyd. Here
the study of political economy was justified as the path to social mobility.
The hero now was Ricardo who 'entered on that great arena which you
have entered with prospects probably inferior to those of the majority
amongst you'.[54]

Aside from McCulloch, both Torrens and Senior took an active part
in the early life of the movement. Torrens was among the first sub-
scribers, and also took part in the speeches of the first anniversary of
the London Institute.[55] Senior frequently adjudicated competitions for
essays on topics of political economy and offered prizes. From 1831,
he offered prizes for essays on emigration, the distribution of revenue,
combinations, and capital and wages.[56] Babbage contributed the third
edition of his Machinery and Manufactures along with one hundred
copies of his chapter 'On a New System of Manufacturing'.[57] John

Parton was a member of the First General Committee of Managers of
the London Mechanics Institute,[58] and T. Perronet Thompson was
asked several times in 1837 to lecture at the London Institute.[59]

The systematic teaching of popular political economy was regarded
as central to the artisan's education in much the same way as was
practical science. The institutes became a centre for a burgeoning
industry in popular political economy. Most of this work was middle-
class propaganda of the crudest kind. Francis Place was a keen advo-
cate of this political economy, and Brougham produced a series of
lectures for use in provincial institutes. Thomas Chalmers believed that
the Mechanics Institutes worked the 'greatest of economic improve-
ments' by giving a 'higher tone to the character' and leading to later
ages of marriages,[60] and that political economy had a definite role in
the Institutes as he 'was not aware of a likelier instrument than a
judicious course of economical doctrine for tranquilizing the popular
mind and removing from it all those delusions which are the main cause
of popular disaffection'.
Political economy was a 'sedative to all sorts of turbulence and dis-
order'.[61] Further, the attention drawn by Chalmers to the affinity
between 'the taste for science' and the 'taste for sacredness'[62] became
the principle behind the co-operation of the church and the mechanics
institutes at a much later date. Political economy within the institutes
taught moral virtue, and the church was quick to follow in this role.[68]

The promotion of the teaching of political economy was accompanied
by the emergence of popular lecturers. The best known of these at the
London Institute were William Ellis and Wilmot Horton. Ellis's teach-
ing was constantly urged on the London Institute by Francis Place.

Ellis sat on the Committee and adjudicated essay competitions.[64] He
held a discussion group at the Institute on social issues, the results of
which were published in 1829 as Conversations upon Knowledge,
_Happiness, and Education.™ His lectures to the London Literary_
Society were probably used by Brougham as the core of the famous
Brougham lectures on political economy,[66] and he ran a session of
lectures at the London Mechanics Institute in December 1832.[67]

Meanwhile Wilmot Horton had given his lectures 'Statistics and
Political Economy especially with reference to the Condition of the
Operative and Labouring Classes' in December 1830. In 1830 Horton
also had the idea of discussing his emigration schemes with a group of
working men, and Birkbeck arranged a group for him at the London
Mechanics Institute.[68] The discussions were followed by a series of ten
lectures, reported to have been very bad.[69] Horton's lectures are also
reported to have raised some turmoil; he complained to the Committee
of the London Institute 'I understand that many members threatened
to take their names out of the Institution and to induce their friends
to do so, if ever I lectured again - that there was no general wish to
hear discussions on political economy - and that I had better go else-
where etc. etc.[570] Horton published both the discussions and the lectures
in 1831, so one can see just what tedious content there was to some of
the political economy taught in the Mechanics Institutes. He presented
his purpose to the discussion groups as 'impressing on your minds certain
important and vital truths affecting the labouring classes and operating

in all countries', and his opinions were not to relate 'to the policy of
changing institutions, but to mere matters of fact'.[71] Horton lectured
on the determinants of wages, emigration, distribution of income, tax-
ation, skill and machinery. In a way suitable to his view of the Mechanics
Institutes he stressed the superiority of the skilled labourer who had
claim to two types of wage - that of manual labour and that of skill.
The skilled labourer had a qualified monopoly in the area of the second
type, and was more immune than the unskilled to economic pressures.
Horton's lecture on machinery typically called attention to the agri-
cultural labourer and he drew heavily on Senior's view of the issue.
Many of the other speakers to the Mechanics Institutes spoke of
political economy in the context of concern over machine breaking.
Heywood spoke several times to the Manchester Mechanics Institute
of advances in technology and the errors behind the destruction of
machinery.[72] The Newcastle upon Tyne Institute heard lectures, in
May 1825, and again in May 1826, 'on the utility of machinery, in
promoting the comfort and happiness of the working classes of society'.[73]

Baines lectured to the Leeds Mechanics Institute on machine breaking
and foreign competition, and Marshall saw one of the advantages of
the Mechanics Institutes as subduing popular errors in trade, wages and
machinery.[74] Birkbeck lectured at the London Institute on the employ-
ment of machinery in 1831.[75] Place, as always, was very clear about
the social meaning of the movement.

The Mechanics Institute is one, if not the most important, of
our institutions. The better sort of working people have received
a portion of instruction and whether this can be described as
either good or bad it cannot be undone ... if the people had
remained in their former ignorance, the burnings now so rife
among the farmers would be as rife among the manufacturers.

The knowledge obtained by the manufacturing people in the
North has led many to the conviction of the fact that machinery
is not and has not been their enemy.[76]

As J. F. C. Harrison has shown, popular political economy prolifer-
ated in the provincial institutes. Many provincial patrons collected
tracts, promoted classes, or, like John Marshall, lectured and wrote the
necessary material themselves.[77]

The Mechanics Institute Movement, during its heyday of the 1820s,
fitted into the improvement ideology of political economy. As I have
shown in previous chapters, labour and the innovating artisans were
regarded as integral to the process of technical change and economic
growth. I have also shown that from within this framework of political
economy emerged new programmes for the progress of wealth which
were contingent on the discipline of the labour force. Though the con-
cern for labour discipline had always complemented the hierarchical
aims of the movement, the aspirations to promote the role of the skilled
labourer in industrialisation had taken precedence. These aspirations,
as this chapter has thus far indicated, certainly had class connotations.
The emotive meaning behind concepts such as 'the arts', 'inventive',
'ingenious', 'experiment', and 'improvement' was meant to camouflage
a central concern with creating a separate class sphere for skilled
labourers. As the movement changed over the 1830s and 1840s the
significance attached to the role of skilled labour appeared to recede
just as it did in political economy. A greater concern with labour
discipline and with industry in its dual meaning came to dominate over
all other aims.

_New programmes and social change_
A slump in the movement was followed by a resurgence in the 1830s
and another in the 1840s. With this, however, came concern over
membership and programmes. Fears about middle-class infiltration into
the membership went as far back as 1826. Concern mounted that the
aspirations of middle-class founders to appeal to factory operatives and
mechanics had not been fulfilled.[78]

The concern to maintain a popular following lay behind a shift in
aims from that of educating a class of inventive artisans to that of
engendering an atmosphere of temperance, rational entertainment and
industrious virtue. But this shift also coincided with the change in
political economy's theories of technological improvement. Concerns
had shifted away from the central role of labour, 'ingenious', 'indust-
rious', or otherwise to the more important role of capital. Simultaneously,
patrons of the institutes shifted their interests from encouraging and
extending a small technical elite of workers to gaining more popular
audiences amenable to moral suasion and social harmony. These latter
aims, of course, had always been assumed by middle-class patrons, and
it would be wrong to see this as a sharp shift from technology to enter-
tainment. In the London Institute subjects from the arts such as history,
French and eloquence, and clerical skills such as stenography accounted
for at least one quarter of lectures over the 1820s. In the 1830s these
subjects gained, accounting for half the lectures and classes given.
Science and technology, however, retained a strong position in a greatly
expanded lecture programme.[79]

Provincial leaders, at least, took pains to justify some change in
orientation. Edward Baines justified entertainment in the Leeds
Mechanics Institute as a way to greater understanding between social
classes. The conditions of social peace, like science, would be conducive
to industry.[80] Baines put this into practice by giving a series of lectures
on his travels in Europe. He received support from John Marshall who,
in 1830, complained that 'the sanguine predictions of the probable
enlargement of science are . . . trite and out of date'.[81] Heywood, too,
produced a programme for more entertaining lectures. He argued for
more entertaining education which would give the working classes the
desire for improvement. He was 'anxious for an altered system of
instruction, not merely that we may give it more variety and interest,
but that we may combine it with moral improvement' .[82]

The middle class was encouraged to accept the value of class contact,

the Minute Books of the Committee of the London Mechanics
Institution for the period 1824 to 1839.

conciliation and co-operation. The Leeds Institute avoided topics at
issue between middle and working classes.[83] The Newcastle Institute
was proud that it had 'opened its doors to every description of persons
desirous of mental improvement . . . accordingly, we see in our rooms,
mixed together, the modest and ingenious apprentice with the experi-
enced and respectable tradesman. This generous mixture must produce
the happiest effects, by separating youth from the insidious temptations
of vice, and affording incitements to improvement and virtue.'[84]

Heywood complained of the 'lack of personal contact and kindly feel-
ing' between classes. He sought ways of breaking down this barrier,
through provident or visiting societies.[85] By 1833 he envisaged close
connections between the Mechanics Institute and the newly formed
Statistical Society, which he would have preferred to have called a
political economy club. He was well aware of problems of class conflict
and saw his own role as one of mediating this conflict. He spoke of the
'benefits of his own circumstances' (as a banker) in not being in an
occupation which mixed him up in 'disputes between masters and
workpeople' and therefore 'less subject to the imputation of interested
motives'.[86]

Like the changes in the orientation of political economy in the 1830s,
these new directions in the Mechanics Institute Movement can be
partially explained by the threat of working-class critiques and alterna-
tives. Just as socialist critiques of the distribution of income elicited new
justifications for capital, so new radical combinations of science and
social science evoked moral and social vindications of the existing system.
An indigenous working-class and radical-scientific tradition reaching
as far back at least as the earliest years of the nineteenth century,
generated a confrontation both inside and outside the Mechanics

years of the London Mechanics Institute, a radical element was never
lacking, with Robertson as editor of the Mechanics Magazine, and
Hodgskin in an influential position. Many of the Institutes felt the cold
draughts of Owenism when Robert Owen became an honorary member
and lectured the London Mechanics Institute on 'The Employment
of Machinery'. Owenite, Chartist and other radical lecturers featured
at the Birmingham, Stalybridge, Sunderland, and Cheltenham
Institutes. Outside the movement there were also alternative socialist
scientific institutes. In Manchester, the break-away New Mechanics
Institute led by Owenites was set up as a direct challenge to the economic
and social assumptions of the established Institute.[87] In Coventry sixty
or seventy socialists seceded from the Institute there and formed their
own establishment.[88]

Radicals looked to science and invention as part of the working-man's
heritage. At times they seemed to echo middle-class propaganda by
claiming that most inventors had been working men like themselves, or
that there were inventive faculties in the people which had been left
'smouldering unmatured'.[89] But they used these arguments not to profess
any belief in social harmony but to demonstrate that capital had aggran-
dised improvements, most of which were first suggested by men on the
job.[90] Radicals of many shades of opinion looked to the more equitable
distribution of scientific knowledge and advised workmen to learn their
scientific principles in preparation for the day when they would take
control of production.[91] Radicals were, also, very critical of the undemo-
cratic structures of the Mechanics Institutes and the content of the
knowledge conferred there. The New Moral World in 1838 called the
name 'mechanics institute' a misnomer 'where mechanics are excluded
from participation in the management of the institution', 'where their
numbers are few compared to other classes' (due to long hours of
labour), and 'where they are looked on more as individuals receiving a
boon from charity'.[92] When Rowland Detrosier opened the New

Mechanics Institute he declared : 'Give to the mechanic that knowledge
which enables him to outvie the workmanship of every other country,
and of what moment is it to him, if the greatest portion of those means
for which he has toiled . . . are taken from him by the operations of a
vicious government.[593] Wealth was not to 'exclude us from the temple
of science[5], but equally the working man 'must grapple with the questions
relating to capital, population, supply and demand; he must study not
only the creation, but the distribution of wealth[5].[94] The radical critics
were not satisfied with knowledge of the physical sciences. They wanted
more than such 'puny morsels of mental food[5].[95] Of what consequence
was it to the working man, they asked, 'to understand the theory of
the winds[5] which it is impossible he could control 'when he needed a
theory of government which would render him either happy or miser-
able[5].[96] Radicals complained bitterly that workmen had been permitted
to 'enter the portals of science[5] provided 'we would not appropriate to
ourselves any of the benefits a knowledge of those sciences is calculated
to confer[5].[97]

These demands had the backing of a popular political economy, one
conceived of from the standpoint of the working classes.[98] When one
thousand Dumfermline working men subscribed to Dr Thomas Murray's
political economy lectures in 1838 they did so because they 'expected
to hear the doctrines of radicalism demonstrated[5].[99] This alternative
political economy, like its middle-class counterpart, analysed the con-
nections between economic improvement and technology. Thomas

Mechanics Institute, lectured there on 'the natural science of national
wealth', despite Francis Place's objections.[100] Hodgskin's conception of
the movement was published in his anonymous Labour Defended against
_the Claims of Capital._

The Mechanics Institutes will teach men the moral as well as
the physical sciences. They will excite a disposition to probe all
things to the bottom and to supply the means of carrying the
research into every branch of knowledge. [The Labourers] may
care nothing about the curious researches of the geologist or the
elaborate classifications of the botanist, but they will assuredly
ascertain why they of all classes of society have been involved
in poverty and distress.[101]

He lectured the Institute in 1826 on Malthusian population theory and
the 'progress of knowledge', claiming a contingency between population
growth and technical change, or what he called 'a knowledge of the
wealth creating arts'.[102] Extending Smith's discussion of the division of
labour, he studied the impact of greater knowledge on productive power.
The division of labour in Hodgskin's system was not the source of
the degeneration of work, but of potential benefit.

Why the labourers actively reap no benefit from division of
labour, why their tasks seem rather to augment than lessen, with
all those improvements which add to their skill and productive
power, in such a degree even as to have given rise to an opinion,
that the division of labour inflicts on them a serious injury...
as all the advantages from division of labour naturally centre in,
and naturally belong to the labourers, if they are deprived of
them, and in the progress of society those only are enriched by
their improved skill who never labour, - this must arise from
unjust appropriations; from usurpation and plunder in the
party enriched, and from consenting submission in the party
impoverished.[108]

But Hodgskin also viewed fixed capital as embodied labour, so that
the knowledge and skill of the labourer who both made and used the
machine became fixed in the machine.

The enlightened skill of the different classes of workmen alluded
to, comes to be substituted in the natural progress of society
for less skilful labour; and this enlightened skill produces an
almost infinitely greater quantity of useful commodities, than
the rude labour it has gradually displaced... the productive
power of this skill is attributed to its visible products, the
instruments, the mere owners of which, who neither make nor
use them, imagine themselves to be very productive persons.[104]

The division of labour and the introduction of machinery were neither
to be stopped nor tempered in Hodgskin's system. Rather, since skill
had been transferred to the machine, the worker had a right to the
ownership of the physical embodiment of his skill.
Hodgskin and other radical lecturers called into question all the
ideals espoused in the rhetoric of the Mechanics Institute Movement.
Rival scientific institutions challenged the conception of science and
the type of knowledge imparted at the establishment institutes. This
revolt soon evoked a response from the traditional societies. Thomas
Coates, who made a study of the many local institutes in 1841 in order
to make recommendations on future directions, urged the movement to
recognise the challenge from both radical and religious circles, and
to broaden its scope. He pointed out that the socialists and the
chartists not only included in the plan of their societies some of the most
attractive subjects of the traditional mechanics institutes, but that they
had added lectures on politics and music, and that they also frequently
held tea parties and dancing. These radical societies had a much wider
appeal than did the Mechanics Institutes, and they were also able to
attract the best scientific lecturers.[105]

The Mechanics Institute Movement responded to this challenge by
making philanthropy and entertainment its keynote. Increasingly,
patrons came to see the institutes as adjuncts of another movement they
had just founded — the statistical movement. The purpose of the new
statistical societies was to provide a suitable mix of philanthropy and
political economy. Patrons, furthermore, came to recognise the per-

manence of classes lower than those aimed for by the Mechanics
Institutes. A new pastime was the formation of Lyceums. These were
to be as cheap as possible, and to offer recreation and elementary edu-
cation. Manchester's was founded in 1838, and was followed by those
in Salford, Ancoates, and Chorlton on Medlock.
The significance of the Mechanics Institute Movement extends, how-
ever, beyond its role in promoting social hierarchies in the work place
and labour discipline. The movement gave a sense of purpose and
cultural affirmation to its patrons - the provincial and industrial middle-
class elites. The success of this movement in bringing this patronage
together, in teaching the connection between science and industry, and
in discovering the worth of provincial culture inspired other scientific
movements. These patrons revived their interests in the older philo-
sophical and scientific societies and made them relevant to the present
day. The organisational experience of the Mechanics Institute Move-
ment as a national movement based on provincial grass roots support
was also to give patrons the confidence to extend their efforts to other
philanthropic organisations, such as the statistical societies, and to other
provincial scientific organisations, which soon found national bearings
in the British Association for the Advancement of Science. This chapter
has so far shown how the ascribed relationship between science and
technology was exploited in the Mechanics Institute Movement to im-
pose middle-class views of the structure and discipline of the labour
force on workers. But the relationship between science and technology
was also used by middle-class patrons in a more enlightened and illus-
trious movement in the British Association, to capture science for their
own project of economic and technological improvement.

_British Association_
In the 1830s the old patrons of the Mechanics Institute Movement
moved on to recruit new allies by pouring new life into their local
literary and philosophical societies. They gave these societies the
national bearings the old Mechanics Institutes had had by creating, in
alliance with metropolitan scientists, the British Association for the
Advancement of Science. This brought intellectuals, politicians, and
businessmen together to promote applied science, with the platform
that economic improvement went hand in hand with scientific progress.
This connection was promoted both by scientists seeking wider markets
for their research, and by industrialists seeking some higher rationale
for their technological choices and expanding enterprises than individual

economic gain. The rhetoric of this movement tried to impress on its
public that technological improvement was not just a creative com-
bination of productive labour and capital. Science, too, was integral
to technological improvement. The marriage was ideal for it gave to
scientists a part in the industrial development of the day, and to
industrialists a sense of civic value. By following their own self-interest
and simply taking up new inventions they could claim to be adding
to scientific enlightenment and the improvement of society in general.
Where science in the Mechanics Institutes had simply meant tech-
nological knowledge, to the new scientific movement of the 1830s it
meant theory - it was the 'research and development' which could place
special economic claims for government support. David Brewster
forged science, technology, and the economy in his gloomy denunciation
of the general neglect of abstract science.

In this rivalry of skill, England alone has hesitated to take part
... she seems to have looked with contempt on the less dazzling
achievements of her philosophers, and, confiding in her past

pre-eminence in the arts, to have calculated too securely on
their permanence. Bribed by foreign gold, or flattered by foreign
courtesy, her artizans have quitted her service - her machinery
has been exported to distant markets - the inventions of her
philosophers, slighted at home, have been eagerly introduced
abroad. Her scientific institutions have been discouraged and
even abolished - the articles which she supplied to other states
have been gradually manufactured by themselves; and, one
after another, many of the best arts of England have been
transferred to other nations.[106]

A major focus of the national institution of the movement, the
British Association, was to give effect to the relationship between science
and technology at something more than a rhetorical level. Charles
Babbage attempted to take credit for any success in this. He argued
forcefully for the meetings to be held in manufacturing towns with the
object of bringing theoretical science into contact with the practical
arts. 'I was, myself, particularly anxious for this, owing as I do a debt
of gratitude for the valuable information which I have received in
many of the manufacturing districts, where I have learned to appre-
ciate still more highly than before, the value of those speculative pur-
suits which we follow in our academical labours.'[107] Babbage also
claimed credit for another scheme which he saw as solving a fundamen-
tal defect in the Association. He thought the basis of the Association was
limited, that it provided little to interest landed gentry or manufacturer.
He saw the solution in the adoption in 1838 of his plan for an exhibition
of the specimens of various manufactured and commercial products of
the districts successively visited by the Association.[108]

William Whewell, in his address to the third meeting of the Asso-
ciation, managed to combine his plea for greater support to theoretical
science with his tribute to technology:

Still, it would little become us here to be unjust to practical
science. Practice has always been the origin and stimulus of
theory: Art has ever been the mother of science... there are
no subjects in which we can look more hopefully to an advance

in sound theoretical views, than those in which the demands
of practice make men willing to experiment on an expansive
scale.[109]

And Professor Daubeny, at the 1836 meeting, stressed the usefulness
of the various abstract sciences to the chemical manufacturer, the
miner and the agriculturalist.[110]

The direct connection between science and technology was estab-
lished at the 1836 meeting when a special Mechanics Section was added
to the Association. Nearly £500 was allocated in the first year for special
research into the Cornish steam engines, into the strength of cast iron,
and into railroad and steamboat research. And the first committee of the
Section included an eminent cast of engineers: Babbage, Charles
Donkin, John Robinson, George Stephenson, Fairbairn, Professor Willis,
and George Rennie.[111] This Section G became one of the most active of
the Association. Most of the papers presented in the first years were
concerned with aspects of the steam engine, the railroad, and fuel
saving. By 1840 there were so many papers and abstracts passed on to
the Section that assessment of main interests is difficult. Fairbairn
presented several papers to it, and several more on practical technical
problems to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.
He produced one in 1837 'On the Strength and other Properties of
Cast Iron obtained from Hot and Cold Blast', and one for the 1844
meeting of the British Association 'On the Consumption of Fuel and
the Prevention of Smoke'.[112]

The rhetoric of the British Association appeared to further the econ-
omic interests of scientists seeking a new style of patronage. It also
apparently satisfied some of the social aspirations of industrialists, but
after a time they had no further need to claim a special suitability for
extending scientific culture. If its purpose was just to contribute to the
social status of those involved, then any other cultural activity - music,
art collections, antiquarian societies - would do just as well. Where
science did appear to have some ultilitarian value as, for example,
the way it was used in the Mechanics Institute Movement to extend a
disciplined and hierarchical labour force, then industrialists would con-
tinue to have some stake in it. For the most part, neither the British
Association nor the many provincial literary and philosophical societies

were able to demonstrate the existence of a relationship between
scientific theory and any practical technological advance. Neither did
many of these societies go beyond mere rhetoric in trying to promote
such a relationship. The Mechanics Section of the British Association,
despite its impressive array of papers and projects, did not demonstrate
any interdisciplinary activity between scientific theory and practical
mechanics or technological knowledge. It existed as an island for tech-
nology among the practitioners and consumers of science. The efforts
of the provincial societies varied. The Manchester Society ranked quite
high with five papers on mechanics in its 1831 Memoirs.[118] Both the
Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society and the Geological
Society of Cornwall had been specifically set up to encourage co-
operation between men of science and men in the mining industry.
But this was the early project of the Newcastle Society, founded in
1793, and by the late 1830s the Society was dying.[114] The Cornwall
Society, set up in 1814 with Davies Gilbert as President,[115] achieved a
successful fusion of geology and mining in its papers, and a local social
identification between cultured gentry and mine adventurers.[116]

The new scientific movement which took off from the 1830s certainly
owed much of its vitality to the interest in science in provincial areas.
It is, however, questionable whether this science was perceived to have
any special economic value. The relationship which was claimed
between science and technology was rhetorical only, and the relation-
ship between scientific and economic improvement was actually per-
ceived to be a connection between technological knowledge and
economic improvement. The scientific movement of the early nineteenth
century acted as a social context for political economy's efforts to
demonstrate the benefits of the contemporary industrial transformation.
A series of provincial societies for the education of the working man,
the Mechanics Institutes, brought together popular political economy
and popular technology. The changes in the aims and rhetoric of these
societies echo those of political economy. The effort to promote the

role of the skilled artisans on a special level of a hierarchically structured
labour market gave way to the purpose of training up a disciplined
adaptable labour force amenable to factory employment and receptive
to technological improvements. In earlier chapters I demonstrated the
similar shifts in the orientation of political economy. Just as these shifts
in political economy were prompted in part by radical working-class
activity, so too in the Mechanics Institutes Movement radical
approaches to scientific knowledge and alternative scientific societies
provoked the Mechanics Institutes to change the focus of their educa-
tional plans. The Mechanics Institute Movement soon found another
context in philanthropic societies such as the statistical societies.
The alignment between technology and the economy was continued in
the middle-class scientific societies - the literary and philosophical
societies and the British Association for the Advancement of Science.
But in these societies there was an extension of the connection between
economy and technology. Scientific theory was added to the formula,
but, although both scientists and industrialists initially found either
social or economic appeal in the combination of science and technology,
the British Association did not make many efforts beyond the level of
rhetoric to put this into effect. The efforts of provincial scientific
societies varied, but there were few attempts even in this scientific move-
ment to distinguish scientific and technical knowledge, and then to
relate the two. The attraction of this scientific movement to provincial
industrialists was soon divested of any substantive utilitarian value,
and became the attraction of social status gained by cultural affiliation
to science, music, art or antiquarianism. More immediate concern was
shown both by provincial businessmen and by technological-scientific
writers, not so much in the connections between technology and science,
but in the connections between technology and the 'science' of the
workshop and factory organisation. The study of economics and of
technology was engaged in at a grass-roots level in business corres-
pondence, management manuals and industrial histories. Responses
to new technology were related at this level to practical questions of
production management. Technology was not just to be understood by
provincial employers and workmen in terms of the high principles of
science; it was also integral to the 'domestic economy of the factory'.


-----

##### The order of the factory

The rhetoric on the connection between technological progress and
economic improvement in the Mechanics Institute Movement had an
explicit economic and social meaning. It was meant to contribute to
the formalisation of hierarchies in the labour movement. The skilled
artisan was to be separated from unskilled common labour, and both
were to be detached from the middle class. This design for creating a
'labour aristocracy[5] was complemented by efforts to contribute to the
discipline of the labour force. The concern with labour hierarchies and
discipline was also expressed at much more concrete levels in industrial
histories and manuals. The writers of these manuals also addressed
themselves to the question of the relationship between science and
technology. They wrote of the use of science in the improvement of
actual production processes, but they took an original approach to the
issue by examining the connections between technology and the science
of workshop organisation. By the 1830s there was already a large
number of industrial histories and lives of inventors. The cotton industry
was a popular subject; McCulloch's history of the rise and progress of
the industry had reached readers of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the
_Edinburgh Review, and The Scotsman.[1] John Kennedy's commentaries_
on the development of cotton textiles had fuelled local pride in the
readers of the Memoirs of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical
_Society.[2] As early as 1835 Edward Baines produced a large and defini-_

tive history of the industry.[3] Memoirs and biographies of early industrial
magnates and inventors were common in the popular mechanics'
journals,[4] encyclopaedias, and journals of the philosophical societies.
Technology had become so popular a subject that journalists such a$
George Dodd could describe their factory tours and observations on
industrial processes with as much alacrity as they had once reported
voyages to distant lands.[5] The Encyclopaedia Metropolitana could
describe its project as one 'derived from the peculiar circumstances of
our times', where 'new discoveries in the different branches of experi-
mental philosophy in the last twenty years are unparallelled in the
history of human knowledge'. The reasoning behind the plan of the
work, divided between pure and applied science, and historical and
technological study, 'will be found in the manifest tendency of all the
arts and sciences at present, from the most purely intellectual events
to the labours of the common mechanic, to lose their former insulated
character, and organize themselves into one harmonious body of
knowledge.'[6] McCulloch and Ure found ready markets for their
_Dictionary of Commerce and Dictionary of Arts Manufactures and_
_Mines.[7] Even highly technical accounts of the steam engine acquired an_
avid readership.[8] In conjunction with their history and description of
technology was to be found an ample supply of manuals on production
processes and on factory organisation and management. Several

published manuals on the scientific principles of organising a workshop
or factory, from James Montgomery on cotton spinning to Robert
Owen on personnel management, were backed up by many unpublished
essays, notes, and memoirs of industrialists themselves who made efforts
to systematise and write about their own practice. It is in the context
of these manuals of management and the broader underworld of
industrial-technological commentary that we find two important tracts,
Charles Babbage's ingenious and quirkish On the Economy of Machin-
_ery and Manufactures, and Andrew Ure's extraordinary and blatant_
panegyric in apology for the factory system, The Philosophy of
_Manufactures.[9] This chapter will concentrate on analysing these two_
tracts and will relate them to the context of this popular industrial-
technological literature. It will focus on the attempts of these writers to
relate their perception of technology to actual production practice,
and will examine their attempts to systematise the organisation of work.
Finally, it will examine the analogies between the relationships of
technology and economic growth as perceived at their grass roots level,
and those set out in the scientific movement and in political economy.
These tracts by Babbage and Ure were popular for the connections
they forged between scientific and technological knowledge, and the
theory and practice of the early industrialists. They clarified, in a way
that neither political economists nor the popular scientific movement
did, that the new machines and new skills could not be discussed in
abstract, in isolation from the factory and the division of labour in the
workshop. Babbage and Ure both had backgrounds in the scientific
movement, being both scientists and leading propagandists of it, and
their tracts on the factory were certainly influenced by this context.
Ure, who had taught at the Andersonian Institute, was a scientific
consultant at the time he wrote The Philosophy of Manufactures.
Babbage's books were, in an indirect way, a result of his scientific
interests, particularly his obsession with his 'calculating machine'.
However, both writers stressed the non-academic basis of their studies
and the significance of observation as the foundation of their ideas.

Babbage regarded his book as the result of a series of observations made
over several years of visiting 'workshops and factories', both in England
and on the continent, 'for the purpose of endeavouring to make myself
acquainted with the various resources of mechanical art'.[10] Ure, too,
stressed that his studies 'derived from a summer wandering through the
factory districts of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Derbyshire'.[11]

_Workshop organisation_
Babbage's On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures first came
out in 1832 with the object of presenting the reader with the mechanical
principles of arts and manufactures, 'which struck me as the most
important, either for understanding the actions of machines, or for
enabling the memory to classify and arrange the facts connected with
their employment'.[12] As stated above, Babbage collected most of his
information on visits through the factory districts of Britain and the
continent. In the first edition of his book, he both exempted himself
from taking up specific questions of political economy, and criticised
political economists generally as 'closet philosophers . . . too little
acquainted with the admirable arrangements of the factory'.[18] He
specified that he had not 'attempted to examine all the difficult questions
of political economy which are intimately connected with such
enquiries'.[14] His second edition of November 1832, however, was an
attempt to correct this. He added three new chapters - one on 'The
New System of Manufacturing', proposing a piece-rate wage system,
another 'On the Effects of Machinery in Reducing the Demand for
Labour', and one 'On Money as a Medium of Exchange'.[15]

In many ways, too, the book was an ingenious offshoot of Babbage's
work on the calculating engine. As he pointed out himself in his first
preface, the book was an application of the principles of the calculating
engine, bringing to bear the mathematical precision and predictability
of his machine on the factories he had toured.[16] The underlying inter-
dependence in the engineering industry between the machine produced

and the technical process was completely explicit in Babbage's work.
His vivid application to the factory of 'these principles of generalization
to which [his] other pursuits have naturally given rise' quite likely had
an important precedent in the similar attributes of the engineering
workshop or factory. The influence of the calculating engine was noticed
by his readers. Cobbetfs Magazine for instance, wrote 'The work bears
the traces of the correctness of this account of its origins . . . [It] is the
emanation of a mind habituated to mathematical precision and arrange-
ment', and 'directed to a subject not previously treated with such
exactness[5].[17]

But the connections between the book and the situation in the
engineering industry were more than mere parallels. The engineer who
was trying to build Babbage's machine was John Clement, a Maudslay
pupil. Furthermore, Clement's bills for building the machine were paid
by a Commission of the Royal Society made up of Doiikin, Rennie,
Brunei and Maudslay.[18] Even if the actual influence of the work process
in the engineering industry may have been a very indirect one in Bab-
bage's mind, the implicit context was certainly plain.
Babbage's overriding concern was with what he called 'the domestic
economy of the factory'. He argued that if the maker of an article
wished to become a manufacturer he had to pay attention to principles
other than merely mechanical ones. He had to attend to the principles
of domestic economy, and arrange the whole system of his factory in
such a way as to sell articles at the minimum possible price.[19] This
domestic economy was to be achieved in the first instance by attention
to scale. 'When the number of processes into which it is most advan-
tageous to divide it, and the number of individuals to be employed in it,
are ascertained, then all factories which do not employ a direct multiple
of this latter number, will produce the article at a greater cost.'[20] Large
factories, however, generally bring out problems of communication
between departments. The implications of early communication inno-
vation were recognised by Babbage. In discussing the economy of time
which could be achieved through the introduction of machinery,
Babbage noted the use of tin tubes for speaking through, used in London
shops and trades. It was in his discussion of The Times as a large

establishment applying an extensive mental and bodily division of labour
that Babbage noticed the possibilities arising from a system of wires
and pullies for transmitting things. He proposed the use of stretched
wire for a 'species of telegraphic communication[5].[21] Babbage's early
perceptions of the development and uses for what would later be the
telephone, the telegraph and overhead assembly track, were generated
by the contemporary concern he perceived for more effective 'organi-
zation in the works'.
Babbage went on to relate the scale of the factory to the division
of labour. 'We have seen that the application of the Division of Labour
tends to produce cheaper articles; that it thus increases the demand; and
gradually, by the effect of competition, or by the hope of increased
gain, that it causes large capitals to be embarked in extensive factories.[522]

The implication to be drawn from this interdependence of scale and
the division of labour was that throughout every stage of manufacture
in such a factory the same economy of skill prevailed.[28]

Babbage's domestic economy of the factory was fundamentally based
on the Smithian division of labour. He reiterated those effects of the
division of labour analysed by Smith, but added to this what became
known as the 'Babbage principle[5].

That the master manufacturer by dividing the work to be
executed into different processes, each requiring different
degrees of skill or of force, can purchase exactly that precise
quantity of both which is necessary for each process; whereas if
the whole work were executed by one workman, that person
must possess sufficient skill to perform the most difficult and
sufficient strength to execute the most laborious, of the oper-
ations into which the art is divided.[24]

The division of labour also applied to the use of machinery. Accord-
ing to Babbage there were two types of machine : that which produced
power, and that which transmitted force and executed work. It was here
that Babbage used the very far-seeing example of the application of
rollers and grease for reducing friction. 'The man who contrived rollers,
invented a tool by which his power was quintupled. The workman who
first suggested the employment of soap or grease, was immediately

enabled to move, without exerting a greater effort, more than three
times the weight he could before.[525] Babbage was one of the few
observers in his own time to recognise the significance of lubrication,
and David Landes has been one of the few historians in recent times
to give grease its due. As Landes put it:

This is a subject that has been much neglected by observers
and students of technology and its history. The great inter-
national expositions of the nineteenth century collected and
displayed industrial activities and products of man with a
comprehensiveness and taxonomic enthusiasm that never fails
to astonish. They assembled all manner of tools and machines,
the raw materials they worked, the finished articles they made.
They did not neglect the products of the soil or the sea, even
the take of the hunt. But they took grease
