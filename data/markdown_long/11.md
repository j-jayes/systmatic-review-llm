Writing a book about gender and work in capitalist economies might
appear to be an ambitious endeavour. The innumerable topic areas relating
to gender and work would dissuade even the most fastidious scholar. While
writing this Preface, my attention has been drawn to a multitude of Equal
Opportunities Commission reports, detailing gender dimensions in the
patterns of contemporary work. It is approximated that between 2004 and
2014 the number of paid employees in the UK will increase by 1.3 million
(quoted in Walby 2007: 7). It is also generally recognized that the world of
work, in the West, is dramatically changing. The ‘traditional’ model of the
adult working life cycle is based on an archetype of full-time permanent
employment, extending from the completion of full-time education into
the commencement of full-time retirement, i.e., ‘48 hours for 48 weeks for
48 years’. But this is rapidly changing.
Innovations in the organization of work, coupled with an avalanche of
new technologies, are shifting the culture of work based on ‘old-fashioned
jobs’ to one founded on a contingent ‘just-in-time’ workforce. Women
feature predominantly among the ranks of flexible workers. In 2005, 12 per
cent of women employees worked flexitime and 42 per cent worked parttime. This compares with 9 per cent of males working flexitime and 9 per
cent of males working part-time (EOC 2006: 12). Equally dramatic trends
are occurring in global labour markets. In developing countries, women
constitute the majority of part-time and impermanent workers (Chen et al.
2005: 9). With few exceptions, women in the developing world achieve a
lower rate of pay than their male counterparts. And their labour market
participation is, invariably, shaped by the interminable demands of care
responsibilities and unpaid household work. Similarities clearly link these
global patterns of female labour market participation with local trends. But
how might one explore these gender dynamics?

x Preface

This book argues that capitalism’s political economy of time, shapes
gendered patterns of work. The concept of political economy is inspired by
a dedicated reading of Karl Marx’s Capital, Volumes 1, 2 and 3. This is not
to assume an adherence to some trans-historical determinant of gender
inequality. Indeed, the conception of power and subjectivity that guides
my analysis is more indebted to Foucauldian genealogy than Marxist dialectical materialism. Nevertheless, the concepts of political economy and
time reverberate throughout the development of Western capitalism, and
efficaciously highlight the irascible complexity of gender in capitalist
economies. Ultimately, this book is about time. Each chapter is linked in
narrative sequence in order to describe, and critically evaluate, the history
and present of Western capitalism’s political economy of time.

The social sciences contribute to a greater understanding of the workings
of societies and dynamics of social life. They are often, however, not given
due credit for this role and much writing has been devoted to why this
should be the case. At the same time we are living in an age in which the
role of science in society is being re-evaluated. This has led to both a
defence of science as the disinterested pursuit of knowledge and an attack
on science as nothing more than an institutionalized assertion of faith with
no greater claim to validity than mythology and folklore. These debates
tend to generate more heat than light.
In the meantime the social sciences, in order to remain vibrant and
relevant, will reflect the changing nature of these public debates. In so
doing they provide mirrors upon which we gaze in order to understand not
only what we have been and what we are now, but to inform ideas about
what we might become. This is not simply about understanding the
reasons people give for their actions in terms of the contexts in which they
act, as well as analyzing the relations of cause and effect in the social,
political and economic spheres, but about the hopes, wishes and aspirations
that people, in their different cultural ways, hold.
In any society that claims to have democratic aspirations, these hopes
and wishes are not for the social scientist to prescribe. For this to happen it
would mean that the social sciences were able to predict human behaviour
with certainty. This would require one theory and one method applicable
to all times and places. The physical sciences do not live up to such
stringent criteria, whilst the conditions in societies which provided for this
outcome would be intolerable. Why? Because a necessary condition of
human freedom is the ability to have acted otherwise and to imagine and
practice different ways of organizing societies and living together.
It does not follow from the above that social scientists do not have a

valued role to play, as is often assumed in ideological attacks upon their
place and role within society. After all, in focusing upon what we have
been and what we are now, what we might become is inevitably
illuminated. Therefore, whilst it may not be the province of the social
scientist to predict our futures, they are, given not only their understandings, but equal positions as citizens, entitled to engage in public
debates concerning future prospects.
This international series was devised with this general ethos in mind. It
seeks to offer students of the social sciences, at all levels, a forum in which
ideas are interrogated in terms of their importance for understanding key
social issues. This is achieved through a connection between style,
structure and content that is found to be both illuminating and challenging
in terms of its evaluation of topical social issues, as well as representing an
original contribution to the subject under discussion.
Given this underlying philosophy, the series contains books on topics
which are driven by substantive interests. This is not simply a reactive
endeavour in terms of reflecting dominant social and political pre-occupations, it is also pro-active in terms of an examination of issues which
relate to and inform the dynamics of social life and the structures of society
that are often not part of public discourse. What is distinctive about the
series is an interrogation of the assumed characteristics of our current epoch
in relation to its consequences for the organization of society and social life,
as well as its appropriate mode of study.
Each contribution contains, for the purposes of general orientation, as
opposed to rigid structure, three parts. First, an interrogation of the topic
which is conducted in a manner that renders explicit core assumptions
surrounding the issues and/or an examination of the consequences of
historical trends for contemporary social practices. Second, a section
which aims to ’bring alive’ ideas and practices by considering the ways in
which they directly inform the dynamics of social relations. A third section
then moves on to make an original contribution to the topic. These
encompass possible future forms and content, likely directions for the study
of the phenomena in question, or an original analysis of the topic itself. Of
course, it might be a combination of all three.
In this spirit Pam Odih’s book takes capitalism, work and gender and
submits them to detailed consideration not only in terms of how they have
changed in the unfolding of history, but their impacts upon everyday life.
Work extends away from communal life into a disciplinary matrix in
which time and effort become subject to routine calculation with effects
upon all those who are its subjects. It is the clock, not the steam engine that
becomes the motor of capitalist development. Time is money. Yet upon
what is capitalism dependent? It is the reservoir of workers who themselves
are a product of a system which is not production, but reproduction in the
domestic sphere.

person who has taught us most about the dynamics of capitalism and global

markets and as long as capitalism persists, his books will remain relevant.
Pam Odih thus devotes a section of her study to the labour theory of value.
She then moves on to note its deficits in terms of understanding domestic
labour and this provides her with a central basis upon which the book
unfolds: that is, to see capitalism as both dependent upon the strata of
domestic labour, whilst also systematically seeking to undermine that area
in its drive for accumulation.
Taking the history of the British textile industry in relation to the
dynamics of gender, capitalism and time bears witness to a restriction of the
working hours of women by male dominated trade unions, thereby
enabling the factory system to exploit domestic divisions of labour in the
process of accumulation. Accompanying this was the mechanization of
production with the consequence that de-skilling was manifest in the
minding of machines. As craft and control were associated with facets of
masculinity, this opened up possibilities for women in the factory system.
However, they were paid less than men and this tended to cement, rather
than challenge, domestic divisions of labour. Those who relied upon home
working to supplement family incomes then found themselves subject to
the economies of scale associated with manufacturing and so unable to
continue in the face of the reach of capitalism into the private sphere. The
issue is then raised concerning the extent to which capital is not the only
determinant of gender identity, but also the interest which men have in the
subordination of women in the domestic sphere.
Dispositions that inform our identities vary. A core argument of this
book is that the difference between men’s and women’s experience of time
is in terms of its relationality: time is shared rather than personal and
routinely experienced through the presence and expectations constituted
in interpersonal relations. Gendered time is thus investigated through a
series of insightful interviews concerning the relations between work and
the domestic sphere. Hence we have the phrase ‘a woman’s work is never
done’ and the experience, encapsulated in chapter five, that there is ‘no
time for oneself’. The attempts to constitute a domestic space in the face of
pressures of time and work driven by a system that is indifferent to context
are clear in the accounts of the women in this study.
As capitalism has reached out in the process of accumulation, so its
effects on everyday life are ever greater. Whereas we had the textile factories, we now have call centres and global assembly lines. Two highly
insightful chapters examine these issues. The first, looking at call centres,
takes the issues of audit and emotional labour and finds a tension in their
actual performance between the demands for output expressed in the
numbers of calls taken and those of quality in terms of customer experience. Some want to evaluate their performance against others, but also
clearly recognize the inherent tensions in the explicit aims of a company
that seeks quality through customer satisfaction. As a result there is resistance to seeing time and performance according to quantitative indicators
of throughput via the mobilization of the rhetoric of the employing

organization. Time is inherently conflictual in such settings and the subject
of continual negotiations, as well as practices through which employees
identify themselves.
The narratives through which we convey and construct a sense of who
we are vary in accordance with our experience of time. In just-in-time
labour processes there is immediacy: production as instantaneity. Being
subject to such processes means we experience time as different things all at
once. Continuity, discontinuity and context all lead to expressions of the
desire for more flexibility in order to have greater control over our lives. As
this occurs, so forms of control in the process of accumulation see others,
separated by thousands of miles, subjected to a 24 hour economy in which
assembly lines in Asia are seen to benefit from the dexterity’ associated with
younger women who are paid low wages.
The indifference associated with capitalist accumulation marches on in
the form of globalization. Race, class and gender inequalities are not a
preoccupation for which there is an assumed responsibility, but a consequence and precondition of what is called ‘success’. Free trade is not fair
trade and the export-based businesses in developing world countries are
forged by the disadvantage of particular groups. The clash between an
increasing feminization of the workforce and domestic divisions of labour
then repeats itself. Ultimately, large corporations are dependent upon both
the formal and informal elements of women’s labour. For this reason these
dynamics need taking more seriously than they have before. The economy
is dependent upon the domestic sphere and this book demonstrates, in a
highly insightful manner, why this has to be taken more seriously and is a
core issue in all of our futures.

But in the Work we freely bear a Part,
And what we can, perform with all our Heart.
To get a Living we so willing are,
Our tender Babes into the Field we bear,
And wrap them in our Cloaths to keep them warm,
While round about we gather up the Corn;
And often unto them our Course do bend,
To keep them safe, that nothing them offend:
Our Children that are able, bear a Share
In gleaning Corn, such is our frugal Care.
When Night comes on, unto our Home we go,
Our Corn we carry, and our Infant too;
...
We must make haste, for when we Home are come,
Alas! we find our Work but just begun;
So many Things for our Attendance call,
Had we ten Hands, we could employ them all.
Our Children put to Bed, with greatest Care
We all Things for your coming home prepare:
You sup, and go to Bed without delay,
And rest yourselves till the ensuing Day;
...
In ev’ry Work to take our proper Share;
And from the Time that harvest doth begin,
Until the Corn be cut and carry’d in,
Our Toil and Labour’s daily so extreme,
That we have hardly ever Time to dream.

2 Gender and work in capitalist economies

Mary Collier presented her poem as a poignant epistle and rejoinder to a
poet who seemed unaware of the arduous and prolonged hours of ‘the
woman’s labour’. The berated poet, and object of Collier’s one-sided
‘flyting’, was Stephen Duck who had composed the poem The Thresher’s
Labour ([1736] 1985). Duck had achieved notoriety for his heart-rending
account of the desolating physical and psychological conditions endured by
the rural labouring classes as a result of primitive accumulation. The
development of capitalism required ‘non-capitalist social strata as . . . a
source of supply for its means of production’ (Luxemburg 1971: 368). The
resulting enclosure of the land caused systemic disruptions to English
countryside life, and irreparably transformed the access of farmers to
common land. In the wake of this upheaval, the rural community was
divided into a landless labouring class, dependent for their livelihood on
rapacious landlords and feckless leaseholding farmers. Duck chronicled the
poverty that accompanied this ‘enclosure of the commons’. Of significance
is his account of the uncompromising hardship invoked by the sale of the
thresher’s labour as a unit of time:

Week after week, we this dull Task pursue,
Unless when winnowing Days produce a new:
A new, indeed, but frequently a worse!
The Threshal yields but to the Master’s Curse.
He counts the Bushels, counts how many a Day;
Then swears we’ve idled half our Time way.
(Duck [1736] 1985: 14)

The hard-edged reality of primitive accumulation is that capitalism, having
seized possession of vital productive forces, also needs ‘a reservoir of labour
power for its wage system’ (Luxemburg 1971: 368). This is because the
greater part of surplus value is realized through the expropriation of labour
time. For these purposes primitive economies, based on the shared ownership of land, directly challenge the market for surplus value. In response,
capital sets out ‘to liberate labour power and to coerce it into service’
(1971: 369). Labour becomes integrated into a commodity economy, and
time is ascribed as a measure of productivity. In this context it is ‘not the
task but the value of time when reduced to money [which] is dominant’
(Thompson 1967: 61). ‘Time is now currency: it is not passed but spent’
(1967: 61). Duck is clearly cognizant of this emerging economy of time.
Thus, The Thresher’s Labour exalts the virtue of industry and condemns the
tyranny of wasting time. But Duck’s account of time and working-class
labour, purposely, marginalizes reproductive labour and the economic
materiality of women’s work. Indeed, it is notable that The Thresher’s
Labour contains little appreciation, or comprehension, of the extent of
women’s labour. Female field workers are depicted as ‘prattling Females,
arm’d with Rake and Prong’ (1985: 20). While the labour time of female
workers is consistently derided as extraneous to material production. Duck
is scornful of the talkative female hay workers. As he derisively proclaims,


-----

Introduction 3

‘Ah! Were their Hands so active as their Tongues, How nimbly then
would move the Raked and Prongs’ (1985: 20). Elsewhere the marginalization of the female field worker, from the time of productive labour, is
confirmed in the association of women’s work with leisure:

The Grass again is spread upon the Ground,
Till not a vacant Place is to be found;
And while the parching Sun-beams on it shine,
The Hay-makers have Time allow’d to dine.
That soon dispatch’d, they still sit on the Ground;
And the brisk Chat, renew’d, afresh goes round.
All talk at once; but seeming all to fear,
That what they speak, the rest will hardly hear;
Till by degrees so high their Notes they strain,
A Stander by can nought distinguish plain.
(Duck [1736] 1985: 20)

Again and again, Duck signifies the ‘noisy prattle’ of the female haymakers, as evidence of their exclusion from the time of material production. Conversely he celebrates the ‘epic heroism of the men’s competitive
scything’ (Landry 1990: 62). As it is ‘With Heat and Labour tir’d’, their
scythes do quit (Duck [1736]1985: 18). It is evident that the thresher’s
labour is bestowed a material status denied that of female labourers. This
realization inspired Collier’s (1739) impassioned rejoinder. Collier was a
working-class rural labourer, keen to highlight women’s labour as social
and material. The first few lines of her rebuke to Duck make clear a case
for women as especially exploited, social and material producers:

. . . My Life was always spent in Drudgery:
And not alone; alas! with Grief I find,
It is the Portion of poor Woman-kind
(Collier [1739] 1985: 6)

Collier insistently articulates a ‘discourse of ‘‘Woman’’ as agent of both
production and reproduction’ (Landry 1990: 73). Duck had ascribed the
thresher’s toil with a heroic determination, which raised masculine consciousness above the indignity of dispossession and the unceasing exploitation of labour time. In the concluding verse of The Thresher’s Labour,
Duck states that ‘Like Sisyphus, our Work is never done; / Continually
rolls back the restless Stone. / New-growing Labours still succeed the past;
/ And growing always new, must always last’ (1985: 27). Collier’s indignation at Duck’s rather hackneyed proverbial tropes is particularly
animated:

For us, you see, but little Rest is found;
Our Toil increases as the Year runs round.
While you to Sisyphus yourselves compare,
With Danae’s Daughters we may claim a share;


-----

4 Gender and work in capitalist economies

For while he labours hard against the Hill,
Bottomless Tubs of Water they must fill.
(Collier [1739] 1985: 17)

Collier was keen to articulate gender difference in the economic hardship
caused by the enclosure of land. This early form of primitive accumulation
had doubly dispossessed the labouring woman; ‘her body and her labor
owned, but neither acknowledged nor appreciated by employer and father
or husband’ (Landry 1990: 60). As Collier expresses it:

Now Night comes on, from whence you have Relief,
But that, alas! does but increase our Grief;
With heavey Hearts we often view the Sun,
Fearing he’ll set before our Work is done;
For either in the Morning, or at Night,
We piece the Summer’s Day with Candle-light.
Tho’ we all Day with care our Work attend,
Such is our Fate, we know not when ‘twill end:
When Ev’ning’s come, you Homeward take your Way,
We, till our Work is done, are forc’d to stay;
And after all our Toil and Labour past,
Six-pence or Eight-pence pays us off at last;
For all our Pains, no Prospect can we see
Attend us, but Old Age and Poverty.
(Collier [1739] 1985: 14–5)

Not coincidently the commodification of time emerges in Collier’s verse as
a particularly rapacious burden. For it is in time that ‘the industrious Bees
do hourly strive, / To bring their Loads of Honey to the Hive; / Their
sordid Owners always reap the Gains, / And poorly recompense their Toil
and Pains’ (1985: 17). The unbroken rhythm of Collier’s prose intentionally reinforces the prolonged toil of women’s labour. And this ‘toil and
pains’, is particularly pronounced in Collier’s account of the exploitation of
female domestics hired, by the hour, by middle-class mistresses:

The Washing is not all we have to do:
We oft change Work for Work as well as you.
Our Mistress of her Pewter doth complain,
And ‘tis our Part to make it clean again.
This Work, tho’ very hard and tiresome too,
Is not the worst we hapless Females do:
When Night comes on, and we quite weary are,
We scarce can count what falls unto our Share.
(Collier [1739] 1985: 15)

In this short extract Collier successfully conveys class, rather than sexual
difference, to be the principal determinant of the uninterrupted nature of
female industry. Thus, men are not the source of the woman’s labouring


-----

Introduction 5

burden. Rather, men are fellow subjects struggling to contend with a new
economy of time; more structured in its rhythm and harsher in its
exactitude than in previous times. To this extent ‘Collier’s project is one of
radical defamiliarization’ (Landry 1990: 65). Such intentions are evident in
Collier’s imaginative reflections on a passing time, in which:

Our first Extraction from a Mass refin’d,
Could never be for Slavery design’d;
Till Time and Custom by Degrees destroy’d
That happy State our Sex at first enjoy’d.
(Collier [1739] 1985: 6)

Collier adopts a neoclassical mythical age for the purposes of signifying
historical exigencies which precipitated the fall of women into ‘slavery’.
The enclosure of land had brought great capital gains for landowners and
leaseholder, but this was at the expense of pre-capitalist economies. Work
had once constituted an extension to communal life and workers were not
subject to the time controls of capitalist production. As Engels observes,
‘they were not forced to work excessive hours; they themselves fixed the
length of their working day and still earned enough for their needs’ (Engels

[1845] 1971: 10). Collier’s notion of the descent of woman, from a
mythical, gilded age, signifies the asymmetrical effects of enclosure. Early
forms of capitalist accumulation instantiated a ‘relentless battle of capital
against the social and economic ties’ of pre-capitalist communities who
were systematically ‘robbed of their means of production and labour
power’ (Luxemburg 1971: 370). While vast capital gains were accrued by
acquiring possession of the land, capital also needed a reservoir for the
expropriation of surplus value. In due course, labour power was integrated
into a commodity economy. Duck’s account of his fellow countrymen
eloquently describes how the local dispossessed peasantry were duly
inculcated into a time-disciplined relation to work. His thresher’s tale is
acutely aware that ‘time-keeping [has passed] into time-serving and timeaccounting and time-rationing’ (Mumford 1955: 5). And thus, the thresher
bemoans the ability of commodified work time to galvanize every passing
moment of the working day. As Duck puts it:

The Spacious Fields we now no longer range;
And yet, hard Fate! Still Work for Work we change.
Back to the barns we hastily are sent,
Where lately so much Time we pensive spent:
Not pensive now, we bless the friendly Shade;
And to avoid the parching Sun are glad.
Yet little Time we in the Shade remain,
Before our Master calls us forth again.
(Duck [1736] 1985: 22)

6 Gender and work in capitalist economies

The notation of time, which emerges with primitive accumulation,
embodies a clear distinction between labour and capital. Labour becomes
subject to the mechanical schedules of capital and its value is now
remunerated according to the linear quantitative units of clock time. Thus,
the thresher’s labour is integrated into a political economy of time, which
demands that his labour generates more value than he needs to survive.
The dialectics of capitalist accumulation depend on the commodification
of time and the expropriation of surplus labour time. But capitalism
is never content ‘with the means of production which it can acquire by
way of commodity exchange’ (Luxemburg 1971: 370). And therein resides
a vital limitation to capital accumulation. For in a society composed of
solely workers and capitalists, the exploitation of labour time will eventually reach an economic threshold. This is because commodified labour
time is a finite resource. It is an indicator of capital and revered as a scarce
resource (Hassard 2001: 133). In this respect capital’s key source of profitability is also its major liability. Collier’s account of the unbearable burden
of social reproduction is indicative of how capital is driven to expropriate
social strata exterior to the dominion of capital (Luxemburg 1971).
Capitalism’s political economy of time needs the non-economic times of
social reproduction as a reservoir for its development. It is the central
contention of this book that the association of women with social reproduction has the effect of situating gender at the heart of capitalism’s
political economy of time. Capitalism requires that ‘We Labour hard
before the Morning’s past / Because we fear the Time runs on too fast’
(Collier [1739] 1985: 13).

Theorizing capitalist accumulation and the political economy
of time

The tempo of industrial life had been steadily transforming long before the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Nevertheless, between 1760 and
1790 a clear distinction had arisen between the old era of agrarian production and the new era of technological change and industrialization
(Plumb 1968: 77). The beginning of this revolution had witnessed the
fortuitous expansion of British trade and the inception of new markets,
both home and abroad. Demand had instantiated the need for increased
productivity and the mercantilists had the capital requirements to invest in
industrial enterprise. Increased capital and technological developments
rapidly transformed traditional methods of industrial organization. The
isolated enclaves of domestic production dissipated as the institution of
national transport networks bound commercial interest in closer unity. By
1790, it was clearly evident that a profound revolution had taken place,
both technical and social.
The Industrial Revolution was driven by a discourse of growth that

perceive time in these terms implies a construct with linear directionality,
cumulative change and rational instrumentality. Such notions were resonant with the intellectual ideas of the European Enlightenment. Scientific
thinking advanced a conception of economic progress intent on elevating
rationality. Central to this enterprise was the vision of achieving regulated
continuous production. This necessitated the development of productive
technologies capable of exceeding the limitations of ‘natural instruments of
production’, i.e., the human body (Marx, Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003:
354). It also required the acculturation of workers into the time-discipline
of industrial capitalist production. Innovations in steam engine-powered
production had enabled the large-scale automation of tasks previously
performed by craftsmen. Gradually the development of interconnected
automation processes precipitated the systematic linkage of machine
technologies, and the extensive mechanization of the productive process.
With the rise of industrial capitalism, a new time consciousness emerges.
Time becomes ‘a commodity of the industrial process’ (Hassard 2001: 133).
Central to this transition is the commodification of productive labour and
the economic imperative equating ‘acceleration and accumulation’ (2001:
133). Technological innovations in manufacturing consolidated the
hegemony of linear time to the productive economy and the notion of
scarcity. Human agents were now ‘obliged to display good stewardship;
time was scarce’ and as a powerful sign of capitalist progress, therefore, it
must be used rationally (2001: 135). Mumford famously observed that ‘the
clock, not the steam engine [was] the key machine of the industrial age’
(Mumford 1934: 14). Large-scale mechanical production and new
economies of scale meant that ‘sophisticated temporal schedules were
necessary to provide a satisfactory degree of predictability’ (Hassard 2001:
134). Time became ‘a commodity of the industrial process’ (2001: 133). By
uniting linearity and value, employers come to realize the imperative to
efficiently ‘use the time of his labour, and see it not wasted’ (Thompson
1967: 61).

Labour theory of value

Karl Marx (1818–1833) chronicled historical transformations in the tempo
of economic life. In Capital, Vol. 1, Marx identifies how in capitalist
regimes of accumulation the labour process operates as a generalized system
of commodity production, based on wage-labour and the conversion of
surplus-value into profit. As he puts it: ‘The rate of surplus-value is . . . an
exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labour-power by capital,
or of the labourer by the capitalist’ (Marx, Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003:
209).
According to Marx, the consciousness of human being achieves fulfilment through labour. This is to recognize that human beings are, first and
foremost, material beings existing in relation to the natural world. Our
consanguinity with nature is active, as opposed to passive, for it is based on


-----

production. And this productive activity guides human beings into relations with each other. Consequently, human beings in association with
each other actively produce ‘the means of the reproduction of their
material life’ (Harris 1983: 180).
Marx elaborates upon this materialist conception of humanity to include
an account of self and subjectivity. For it is through labour that human
beings control the ‘re-actions’ between the self and nature (Marx Capital,
Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 173). By applying labour to the external world, and
transforming it, human beings at the same time change their own nature
(2003: 173). To this end, Marx contends that:

At the end of every labour-process [the labourer] not only effects a
change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises
a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to
which he must subordinate his will.
(Marx, Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 174)

Such dedication is ‘no mere momentary act’ (2003: 174). It demands ‘that
during the whole operation the workman will be steadily in consonance
with his purpose’ (2003: 174). In these circumstances the ‘labour has
incorporated itself with its subject: the former is materialised, the latter
transformed’ (2003: 176). Whenever labour is engaged in the whole
process of production, this has the effect of creating an embodied,
meaningful relation to the labour process. However, the propensity of
human beings to achieve the fullness of their humanity, in work, is contingent on the conditions under which labour is performed. Throughout
history, human action has constantly advanced its capacities in the
‘appropriation of natural substances to human requirements’ (2003: 179).
Hence the relation of humankind to production is a dynamic process of
historical materialism. Following Hegel, Marx asserts the existence of an
inherent dialectic in the development and displacement of modes of
production. This dialectic produces contradictions and incongruences
betweens structural elements of the labour process (i.e., between owners
and non-owners of the means of production). According to Marx, the
labour process in capitalist production is distinct in its capacities to imbue
both economic production and human reproduction with the logic
of commodity production. Thus, in capitalist regimes of production,
the labour process is transformed ‘into the process by which the
capitalist consumes labour-power’ (2003: 180). Labour power becomes a
commodity and ‘the labour-process is a process between things that the
capitalist has purchased’ (2003: 180).

Buying and selling productive labour time

Marx contends that it is labour which produces value, and surplus labour is
converted into monetary profit by the capitalist during the circulation of
products on the market. Pivotal to Marx’s concept of value is an important

Introduction 9

distinction between ‘useful’ and ‘abstract’ labour (Meek 1979). Use-value
can be defined objectively as the utility of the product or subjectively as the
usefulness of the labour required to produce it. When use-value is considered subjectively, the concept of ‘useful’ labour emerges (1979: 165).
Marx defined ‘useful’ labour as ‘productive activity of a definite kind and
exercised with a definite aim’ (Marx Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 49).
Labour in this form creates use-value, but the labour which finds
expression in profit, according to Marx ‘does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it as a creator of use-values’ (2003: 49). Commodity production’s primary aim is not the creation of use-value as such,
but the manufacture of goods for sale. In this sense, use-values are of
relevance to the commodity producer in so far as consumer expectations
need to be taken into account.
Marx distinguishes ‘useful’ labour from ‘abstract’ labour. The latter’s
distinguishing characteristics are axiomatic to production within modern
capitalist societies. As Marx puts it, the concept of ‘abstract labour’ is ‘truly
realised only as a category of the modern society’ where ‘individuals pass
with ease from one kind of work to another, which makes it immaterial to
them what particular kind of work may fall to their share’ (Meek 1979:
165). This abstraction expresses a relation which in fact dates back to a
much earlier time when products first started to be turned into commodities. Indeed, the exchange of goods for money designated the essential
precondition for capitalism and marked a historical disjuncture with the
mode of production which had occurred in the feudal era. The economic
and social structure of pre-industrial Britain was organized around a system
of feudal agriculture in which land was given as a reward for service. Goods
produced in pre-capitalist social formations were typically for immediate
consumption and not to be exchanged in a market place. Thus, in feudalism, it is precisely because ‘personal dependence forms the ground work
of society, there is no necessity for labour and its products to assume a
fantastic form different from their reality’ (Marx, Capital Vol. 1 [1887]
2003: 81). After the Industrial Revolution, and with the inception of
factory-based production, the goods produced were legally defined as the
property of the owners of the means of production. With growing commodity production, where tasks began to be performed for future needs or
for trade, there occurred a more rigid demarcation between the workers
and owners or controllers of capital. This was a time when labour first
started to ‘acquire its social character from the fact that the labour of the
individual [took] on the abstract form of universal labour’ (Marx 1971: 29,
quoted in Meek 1979: 165). The point of significance here is that whereas
labour begins to assume a social character from the moment men (sic) begin
to work for each other, the special form in which this social character
manifests itself differs from epoch to epoch (Meek 1979: 165). Following
this, Marx identifies how in a commodity-producing society, the social
character of each producer’s labour manifests itself in the fact that this
labour is reduced to abstract labour, and:


-----

10 Gender and work in capitalist economies

the social character that his (sic) particular labour, has of being the
equal of all other particular kinds of labour, takes the form that all the
physically different articles that are the products of labour, have one
common quality, viz that of value.
(Marx, Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 78)

The distinction between useful and abstract labour is axiomatic to Marx’s
account of the expropriation of profit through surplus value. If a use-value
derives value ‘only because human labour in the abstract has been
embodied or materialised in it’, the magnitude of this value is therefore
measured by ‘the quantity of the value-creating substance, the labour,
contained in the article’ (Sayer 1989: 52). The quantitative measure of
labour is derived by the expenditure of time and ‘labour-time in its turn
finds its standard in weeks, days and hours’ (1989: 52). Thus:

Labour has been equalized by the subordination of man to the
machine or by the extreme division of labour . . . the pendulum of the
clock has become as accurate a measure of the relative activity of two
workers as it is of the speed of two locomotives . . . Time is everything, man is nothing; he is at most, time’s carcass. Quantity alone
decides everything; hour for hour, day for day.
(Marx 1967: 151)

If human labour creates value, the clock is its measurement. The
mechanistic metaphors of time used by Marx are commensurate with the
objectification of labour in capitalist production. The logic of the capitalist
mode of production ‘is and remains – the mass of direct labour time, the
quality of labour employed, as the determinant factor in the production of
wealth’ (Marx 1973: 704). Labour power is defined by Marx as ‘the
aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human
being, which he [sic] exercises whenever he produces a use-value of any
description’ (Marx, Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 164). In capitalist production, what Marx calls ‘the dull compulsion of economics’ coerces
individuals to sell their labour power as there is little other means of
survival other than to enter into a subordinate relationship with capital.
Conversely, the owners of the means of production retain control over
capital and in so doing possess – for the working day – the bodies tied to
labour power. The worker for a proportion of the working day is paid
back, in the form of wages, the value which is generated from their labour.
The capitalist, however, only pays the worker the value of the reproduction of labour power (the sum cost of maintaining the worker at a
socially determined level of subsistence). But labour has the curious ability
to generate more value than it needs to survive and reproduce itself. The
difference between the value of the commodity, created by labour power
and the salary supplied to the labourer is surplus value. Thus, in capitalist
production, the exchange of equivalences has been turned around to

Introduction 11

produce a generalized system of commodity production, based on wagelabour and the conversion of surplus value into profit.
Marx’s analysis of capitalist production equates capitalist accumulation
with the expropriation of surplus labour time. Marx argued that the value
of a commodity is determined by ‘the quantity of the value-creating
substance, the labour, contained in the article’ (Marx, Capital, Vol. 1

[1887] 2003: 46). Marx further argued that ‘the quantity of labour . . . is
measured by its duration and labour-time in its turn finds its standard in
weeks, days and hours’ (2003: 46). Thus the primary determinant of a
commodity’s value is the amount of labour time invested in its production.
For Marx, the expropriation of surplus labour time forms the basis of
capitalist accumulation. But in Marx’s theory the analysis of labour time is
relevant only in so far as it has direct relation to capital and the making of
profit. Thus, in a society based on commodity production, labour, which
exists outside of trade and the market place, is conspicuously absent from
Marx’s economic categories. In this sense capitalist accumulation materializes ‘at the point of production’ between the time the worker enters and
leaves the factory gate (Williams 1988: 37).

Theorizing gender, capitalist accumulation and the political
economy of time

Social relations outside of the point of production are regulated, in Marx’s
analysis, to the realm of the ‘superstructure’ and thus not perceived as
determinants of the capitalist’s expropriation of surplus labour time. Small
wonder then that Marx’s analysis has been described as resonating with the
eighteenth century understanding of ‘private and public’, in which the
private sphere is associated with reproduction and familial relations (Harris
1983: 179). Conversely the public sphere is the basis of economic life.
Since domestic labour is situated outside the realm of economic production
(as it does not involve the direct exchange of labour power for wages), the
economic dimension of domestic labour is conspicuously absent from
Marx’s analysis of capital (Williams 1988: 40). Marxist feminist writers
suggest that forms of work conventionally considered as ‘outside the
commodity system’ and outside of ‘economic calculation’ invariably relate
to work carried out by women (Rowbotham 1973: 68). To this extent,
Marx’s tendency to exclude domestic labour as a category of capitalist
accumulation ‘is part of the more general economic dominance and
cultural hegemony of men over women’ (1973: 68). Marx’s failure in
this respect stems from his assumption that capitalist accumulation
systematically transforms ‘social structure as it transforms the relations of
production’ (Hartmann 1981: 10). The family and domestic labour time
expended in the reproduction of the working class are merely discerned as
‘by-products of the accumulation process itself’ (1981: 10). Feminist
writers have been keen to address the marginalization, in orthodox

Marxism, of domestic labour time. In Marxist theory, domestic labour time
is, by default, functional to and determined by capitalism (Williams 1988:
40). This is because Marx’s focus on the capitalist–proletariat relationship
provided little space for an analysis of how the times of reproductive labour
relate to capitalist accumulation. But feminist attempts to incorporate
gender into Marx’s political economy of time have, often, compounded
the displacement of ‘woman’ from a discourse of material production (see
Chapter 3). This is because their valorization of domestic labour time, as
equating with capital’s expropriation of surplus labour time, produces a
technically flawed account of Marx’s economic categories. To this extent,
feminists have, inadvertently, constituted domestic labour time as ‘Other’
to the economic times of the productive economy. An alternative position
is to develop the tendency that Rosa Luxemburg observed, for capitalist
expansion to, on the one hand, depend on the preservation of non-economic strata and, on the other, to systematically erode these areas as part of
capital accumulation. Similar dynamics are evident in the organization of
gender in capitalism’s political economy of time. This book argues that the
dialectics of capitalist accumulation situate gender at the heart of capital’s
political economy of time.
Axiomatic to capitalist accumulation ‘is the transformation of the
commodity into money and retransformation of money into the condition
of production’ (Marx 1973: 537). The circuits through which capital
progresses constitute divisions of circulation, ‘and these sections are travelled in specific amounts of time’ (1973: 538). In this respect, an important
factor determining the realization of capital is not distance to market
(space) but the speed travelled. This is because the speed of circulation
directly determines ‘the speed with which the production process is
repeated’ (1973: 538). Since this is the case, the fundamental operation of
the capitalist economy is to multiply ‘how often capital can be realized in a
given period of time’ (1973: 538). Indeed, businesses which fail to accelerate turnover time, risk surrendering their profits to competitors. Consequently capital must, on the one hand, strive to eradicate spatial barriers
to exchange and, on the other hand, strive to ‘annihilate this space with
time, i.e., to reduce to a minimum the time spent in motion from one
place to another’ (1973: 593). This is because the velocity of circulation is
both a determinant of productivity and a limitation on how often capital
‘can reproduce and multiply its value’ (1973: 538).
In as much as capitalist accumulation depends on the production of
surplus value, the circuit which capital travels ‘appears as the time of
devaluation’ (Marx 1973: 538). Thus any deviation from a circulation time
of zero is a deviation from a maximum level of value creation and an
obstacle to the realization of labour time. This is because deceleration has
the affect of increasing necessary labour time and therefore decreasing the
expropriation of surplus labour time. But the intention of capital is not
merely surplus value extraction within a given amount of time. It is the
purpose of capital accumulation to achieve ‘surplus value ad infinitum’

Introduction 13

(Luxemburg 1971: 39). And this is a particularly apposite description of the
generation, by capital, of ‘absolute surplus value’. In this situation, socially
necessary labour time contained within the working day remains constant
while surplus labour time is significantly increased. It ‘is conditional upon
an expansion, specifically a constant expansion, of the sphere of circulation’
(Marx 1973: 407). Consequently absolute surplus value also has a direct
bearing on the technologies of production, as it attempts to yield an
increased magnitude of output, while retaining the rate of variable capital
inputs to a level which does not threaten the rate of surplus value. To this
extent, capitalist accumulation ‘cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production’ (Marx and Engels 1985: 37). This
translates into continuous transformations in the modes of production as all
fixed relations are swept away and ‘all newly-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify’ (1985: 37). Expanding production, by
individual producers, soon becomes a contagion ‘which spreads automatically like a tidal wave over ever larger surfaces of reproduction’
(Luxemburg 1971: 41).
The creation by capital of absolute surplus values strives towards the
universal maturation of the forces of production. And this expanding
‘spatial orbit of its circulation’ suggests that we must enquire as to how it is
that capital is able to sustain an even greater extension of the means of
production. ‘If labour time is regarded not as the working day of the
individual worker, but as the indefinite working day of an indefinite
number of workers’ (Marx 1973: 539), then the universal expansion of the
forces of production would be limitless. But, in so far as necessary labour
time is a condition of reproduction, an increase in the forces of production
‘suspends capital itself’ (1973: 543). From this point of view, the appropriation of surplus labour time is a natural barrier to the repetition of
production. Marx recognizes this exigency in his account of ‘relative
surplus value’. He argued that the ‘production of relative surplus value’ is
based on ‘the increase and development of the productive forces’ (1973:
408).
The transition to monopoly capitalism in the 1900s, witnessed a systemic
transformation in capitalist accumulation from a strategy of ‘absolute surplus value’ to relative surplus value. Relative surplus value extraction
entails reducing working hours through an increased productivity of labour
and the development of technology in the mechanization and rationalization of the labour process (Goldman 1995: 16). The more advanced the
capital, the more predicated it is upon the continuous expansion of market
relations and the more it strives for the accelerated appropriation of surplus
value through ‘greater annihilation of space by time’ (Marx 1973: 539). But
in relative surplus value production, the accelerated pace of surplus value
creation requires both a quantitative and qualitative expansion of existing
consumer markets. This is because the creation by capital of absolute
surplus value involves making deductions from ‘a given quantity of [valuecreating] labour’ (1973: 554). In these circumstances capital is continually

maximizing the expropriation of objectified labour through extended
working hours and this enables ‘capital to renew this profitable bargain . . .
on a more enlarged scale’ (1973: 550). Conversely, in relative surplus value,
an increase in the productivity of work is accompanied by a decrease in the
number of hours worked. This leads to an accumulation of undifferentiated
commodities and the need for the ‘creation of new use values’ (1973: 408).
This suggests the creation of values which exceed the notion of useful
values and encompass a spectrum of qualitative differences. To this extent,
‘the surplus labour gained does not remain a merely quantitative surplus,
but rather constantly increases the circle of qualitative differences within
labour’ (1973: 408). It is, therefore, apparent that the production of relative
surplus value must be augmented by the expropriation of an additional
non-capital reservoir of time. Marx provides some indication of this when
he states that:

This creation of new branches of production, i.e., of qualitatively new surplus value time, is not merely the division of
labour, but rather the creation, separate from a given production, of labour with a new use value; the development of a
constantly expanding and more comprehensive system of different kinds of labour, different kinds of production, to which a
constantly expanding and constantly enriched system of needs
corresponds.
(Marx, 1973: 409)

It is evident that capitalist accumulation requires a reservoir of non-economic times as a basis for the production of relative surplus value. In
contemporary regimes of capitalist accumulation, this translates as ‘the
universal appropriation of nature as well as of the social bonds itself by the
members of society’ (1973: 409). Just as production founded on absolute
surplus value expropriates the objectified time of ‘value-creating labour’, so
the production of relative surplus value entails ‘the exploitation and
exchange of natural and mental forces’ (1973: 410). Consequently the
qualitative times of social reproduction are an integral resource of capitalist
accumulation. It is my contention that the association of feminine identity,
and women’s work with social reproduction, has the effect of placing
gender at the heart of capitalism’s political economy of time. This book
develops this contribution through an analysis of gender and work in
industrial times, modern times and post-Fordist times.

Part I Industrial Times

The invention of the steam engine and of machines for weaving and
spinning, in the mid-eighteenth century, transformed Britain from being a
primarily agricultural society to an industrial nation (Engels [1845] 1971).
These early technical innovations ‘gave the impetus to the genesis of an


-----

Introduction 15

industrial revolution’ (1971: 9). In 1733, John Kay invented the flying
shuttle, which substantially increased the speed of weaving and by the
1750s was widely used in weaving fustians (Rose 1996: 39). Elsewhere,
new technology put in motion the mechanization of spinning. Imports of
raw cotton had substantially increased during the mid-eighteenth century,
reflecting ‘a steadily-rising demand for fustians and cotton-linens’ (1996:
39). This increase marked the rapid ascent of the British textile industry.
But it also brought about a significant threat of labour shortage among a
mostly female workforce of hand spinners. Traditionally spinning was
carried out in the homestead using a spinning wheel. Technological
advances in textile production precipitated new forms of labour market
organization. The revolutionary new textile machines could be operated
by unskilled women or children who invariably would be paid less than a
skilled male labourer. Such profit margins encouraged an unprecedented
shift in the participation of women in the labour process. For example, it is
estimated that of the 10,000 textile workers employed in 41 Scottish mills
in 1816, two-thirds were female and a significant proportion of these were
under the age of 18 (Davies 1975: 41). Life in the factories was discordant
and harsh. Of concern were the abrasive forms of time discipline administered by the ‘frugal-minded overseers’ (Bryant 1971: 56). Women and
children often fared worse, as they were more likely to be disempowered
by an extended division of labour which confined them to the least skilled
sectors of the labour market (Honeyman 2000).
Historical records highlight significant difference in the wages of male
and female industrial workers. According to Burnette, ‘the female-male
wage ratio generally varied from one-third to two-thirds, depending on the
type of work and location’ (1997: 257). But, significant controversy exists
over the role of wage discrimination as a determinant of this wage gap. It
has been suggested that, for much of the industrial period, normative
assumptions about the dynamics of the family meant that employers were
disinclined to offer a ‘living wage’ to females (Valenze 1995: 89). Women
were presumed to be economically dependent upon ‘a household headed
by a male and therefore did not depend only on her wages for subsistence’
(1995: 89). Historians, adopting this position, have argued that female
industrial workers received a ‘customary wage’ rather than ‘market wages’.
The concept of a ‘customary wage’ suggests that ‘women did not receive
‘‘market wages’’ – wages equal to their marginal product – but rather
received wages determined by custom and gender role’ (Burnette 1997:
261). If this is accepted, it can justifiably be argued that women in the
labour market during the Industrial Revolution experienced wage discrimination. Joyce Burnette systematically challenges this orthodoxy.
Burnette has applied neoclassical economic theory to the analysis of the
female-male wage gap. According to neoclassical economic theory, ‘wages
equal the marginal product of labour’ (1997: 257). Thus, in conventional
neoclassical economic theory, any disparities in wages are interpreted ‘as
evidence of productivity differences’ (1997: 257).


-----

16 Gender and work in capitalist economies

Burnette’s detailed secondary data analysis of key historical records, sets
out to confirm this neoclassical economic model. According to Burnette,
historical records consistently suggest that ‘the large ‘‘wage gaps’’ historians
have used as evidence of discrimination are often simply differences in
earnings resulting from differences in hours worked’ (1997: 263). She
claims that ‘during the period conventionally termed the industrial revolution women were less productive than men in most types of work’
(1997: 272). According to Burnette, these sex differences in productivity
partly stem from differences in human capital (1997: 272). Women were
often excluded from apprenticeships and thus acquired less training and
skills than males. Females were also less inclined to receive a formal education and had lower levels of literacy than their male counterparts. While
recognizing these features to be aspects of pre-market discrimination,
Burnette claims that ‘they still represented differences in human capital
which would have affected productivity and thus women’s market wages’
(1997: 272). Such conclusions collaborate with conservative discourse,
which assumes that disparities in the wages of men and women during the
Industrial Revolution were a consequence of market factors (Honeyman
2000: 55). What is lost in such perspectives is an engagement with the
dynamics of power which systematically devalued the labour time of
female textile workers.
Chapter 1 historically investigates the significance of gender to primitive
accumulation. Specifically, this chapter examines the transition from
domestic production to the proto-capitalist production of textiles from the
1500s–1800s. Historical changes in the mode of textile production
exemplified how, with the emergence of industrial capitalism, productive
activity is linked to the ‘production for exchange’ and associated with the
market place (Alexander 1989: 40). Conversely ‘production for use’ was
associated with female labour and the less culturally recognized private
sphere of home and family. The emergence of factory-based textile production mapped onto these processes, thus ensuring the economic
dependence of women upon the male members of the household. Of
particular relevance were the demise of the handicraft’s system and the rise
of family factories. Both of these were interim stages in the transition from
domestic to industrial production. And both of these stages emerged as a
consequences of a new political economy of time, which in its early
incantations was directed at devaluing the qualitative rhythms of domestic
production. Chapter 1 develops this contribution through a combination
of theoretical formulations, and the documentary analysis of parliamentary
papers derived from the nineteenth century.
Chapter 2 traces the economies of time which established the British
textile industry in the nineteenth century. This chapter contends that, in the
nineteenth century, capitalism conceded to pressure from men to restrict
the working hours of women. Male trade unions were successful in persuading the state to pass legislation restricting the employment of women
and children. Male workers capitalized on the restricted working hours of

Introduction 17

female workers most especially in their claim for ‘the so-called family wage’
(Walby 1990: 40). Using documentary evidence, Chapter 2 describes how
the factory system traded upon gender inequalities in the domestic division
of labour time, and exploited this as a basis for capitalist accumulation.
Chapter 3 theoretically develops the empirical theme of Chapters 1 and
2. It critically examines feminist perspectives that have linked the rise of
industrial capitalism with the exploitation of domestic labour time. This
chapter examines the theoretical complexities encountered when
attempting to reformulate domestic labour time as ‘productive labour’.
According to Margaret Benston (1989), ‘the amount of unpaid labour
performed by women is very large and very profitable to those who own
the means of production. To pay women for their work, even at minimum
wage scales, would involve a massive redistribution of wealth’ (1989: 41).
Maria Dalla Costa and Selma James (1975) make a similar claim in The
Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community. They argue that the
expropriation of domestic labour time is an integral component of capitalist
accumulation. Domestic labour time not only produces use-values (i.e.,
goods and services that have tangible utility) but also surplus value, which is
exploited by the capitalist as a source of profit. To this extent, Dalla Costa
and James argue that:

within the wage, domestic work produces not merely use-values, but
is essential to the production of surplus value. This is true of the entire
female role as a personality which is subordinated at all levels, physical,
psychological and occupational, which has had and continues to have
a precise and vital place in the capitalist division of labour, in the
pursuit of productivity at the social level.
(Dalla Costa and James 1975: 33)

Dalla Costa and James’s account of the family, as a social factory, provoked
seismic fissures in Marxist feminist analysis. Chapter 3 problematizes
feminist attempts to force an affinity between domestic labour and the
economic categories of productive labour time. Domestic labour is indeed
‘socially necessary labour’ but it does not meet either of Marx’s criteria for
discerning productive labour (Seccombe 1974: 11). The relation of
domestic labour with capital is neither direct (i.e., it is not salaried) nor a
source of surplus value (does not create more value than it possesses). To
this extent, ‘domestic labour is unproductive labour’ (in the economic
sense) and conforms to Marx’s description of an unproductive labour
‘exchanged not with capital but with revenue that is wages or profits’
(1973: 11). A crucial mistake of trying to force domestic labour into Marx’s
economic categories is to prompt the mistranslation of domestic labour
time as unproductive labour. This only reinforces the tendency for
orthodox Marxists to constitute domestic labour time as marginal to the
economic categories of capitalist accumulation. An alternative position is to
emphasize that capital’s political economy of time depends upon the
expropriation of domestic labour time as a non-economic resource.

Part II Modern Times

The establishment of wage relations in the second half of the nineteenth
century, ensued the rise of the ‘employment society’ and a movement
towards Taylorized, synchronized work. Frederick Winslow Taylor
(1856–1915) had formulated the principles of ‘scientific management’.
Taylor’s technological interventions into the ‘natural’ flow of work events
were geared towards achieving the wholesale rationalization of the labour
process. Taylorism describes how labour productivity can be dramatically
increased by ‘breaking down each labour process’ into narrowly specialized, unskilled tasks performed according to ‘rigorous standards of time and
motion study’ (Harvey 1990: 123). Time was translated into economic
terms and ‘it became the medium in which human activities, especially
economic activities, could be stepped up to a previously unimagined rate of
growth’ (Nowotny 1976: 330). Henry Ford applied Taylor’s scientific
management principles in an attempt to achieve complete and consistent
interchangeability of parts and ultimate simplicity in assembly.
Fordist production epitomized the modern definition of time as predicated on the sequential organization of synchronized activities. Fordist
industrialism was based on the expropriation of working time and its
distinction from one’s own time (leisure). The component elements of
Fordist production have been described as ‘a search for massive internal
economies of scale based on assembly line methods, technical divisions of
labour and standardization of outputs’ (Scott 1988: 173). Fordism entailed
the concentration of utilized labour power in minimal units of time, which
maximized the extraction of surplus value in its most rational economic
form (Braverman 1974).
Ford’s use of time and motion studies to calculate the speed of individual
task provides further indication of capital’s desire to control the rate of
production. Indeed, Fordism is indicative of a rapid deskilling and insidious
degradation of work. Chapter 4 locates this analysis of Fordism within an
overall observation of clerical and service occupations. During the early
twentieth century, a vast proportion of Western capital was concentrated
in the enterprises of corporate entrepreneurs (Braverman 1974). One
consequence of this rapid corporate growth was the demand for expanded
office structures and the dramatic increase in general office work (Morgall
1986). The vast expansion in the volume of office work encouraged the
pursuit of techniques capable of making office work more efficient (1986:
117). Taylorist processes of scientific management were adopted to measure office work and eventually to control the work process (1986: 117).
Feminist writers have variously suggested that the conception of time
embodied in Fordist production is in contradiction with the ‘cyclical’ and
‘relational times’ of childcare (Davies 1990, 1994; Deem 1996; Leccardi
1996). Davies (1990, 1994) and Leccardi (1996) have, for example, argued
the incompatibility of ‘women’s time’ with a linear perspective which
separates work from leisure, the public from the private, and task-based

Introduction 19

from clock-based orientations to time. But many of these feminist challenges are epistemologically grounded in the very same representational
tradition which has secured the hegemony of linear time. For these
feminist discourses tend towards either a strategy of reversing the phallocentricity of linear time and/or synthesizing the binary elements of their
discourse (i.e., its male/female opposition) into mutually inclusive dualistic
pairs. The problem that unites these respective strategies is that they fail to
displace the dualistic epistemology that is at the heart of Enlightenment
thought. Chapters 4 and 5 present an alternative discourse of time, modern
work and gendered subjectivity.
The empirical research, which forms the basis of Chapters 4 and 5,
employed an eclectic fusion of in-depth unstructured interviews, observations and group discussions. Respondents were selected through ‘theoretical sampling’ (Strauss and Corbin 1990). This sampling approach
eschews representation for a pursuit of respondent selection based on
analytic deduction. In my research, the process of sampling aimed to
develop theory by selecting respondents who maximized the theoretical
development of key conceptual ideas. Collectively, this amounted to
approximately 60 in-depth discussions. The qualitative interviews were
informed by a feminist epistemology in which the search for authentic
meaning and an authentic account of social reality is a profound methodological challenge. This is because the epistemological foundations of
Western discourse implicitly, or explicitly, silence marginalized groups. It
does this whenever the experiential differences which distinguish
researcher (knowing subject) and researched (unknown object) are
obscured (Stanley and Wise 1983). Feminist epistemology identifies
mainstream social research as saturated by an androcentric bias. While
purporting to speak for human beings, traditional social research is
‘grounded in, derived from, based on and reinforcing of the experience,
perceptions and beliefs of men’ (Du Bois 1983: 106). Conversely, feminist
research is research ‘on, by and for women’ (Stanley and Wise 1983: 17).
The sharing of subjectivity through feminist research practice and ‘dialogue’ (Collins 1991) constitutes a ‘conscious partiality’; a partial identification with the research object. Conscious partiality is distinct from mere
subjectivism or simple empathy. It seeks to achieve a two-way discussion,
between the researcher and interviewee, which widens the consciousness
of both, the researcher and the researched. Despite its emancipatory
intentions, conscious partiality has been the object of extensive criticism.
Game (1991: 30) describes this notion as presuming a unified category
‘women’ and even more significantly, privileging a certain consciousness
‘which knows what it is to be a woman’. In this sense, feminist consciousness constitutes a regime of ‘truth’ and subjugation, as it ‘authorises a
representation of those who do not as yet have this [consciousness], but
might become one of ‘‘us’’ ’ (1991: 30).
Feminist epistemology defines the specific form and function of feminist
research. Writers variously identify feminist research design as informed by


-----

20 Gender and work in capitalist economies

an attention to ‘realism’. That is a standpoint motivated towards accessing
women’s essential material experiences. It is assumed that the material
inequalities (e.g., gender difference in pay) experienced by women, define
their daily lives in ways that fundamentality differ from the experiences of
men. Material inequality mirrors the subordination of women in the public
and private spheres. Feminists argue that gender inequalities, in wider
society, provide women with a subjective realism which is perceptible to
the contradictions and limitations of material culture. But claiming access
to knowledge of ‘reality’ from any standpoint is an inherently problematic
exercise. Consequently, it is of no surprise that feminist research premised
on methodological realism has experienced significant challenges.
Researchers have questioned the tendency for feminist research within this
tradition to overly theorize women’s daily lives. My research, was therefore, cognizant of how the imposition of sociological categories can
overshadow women’s experience or force these experiences into existing
gender stereotypical categories (Ribbens and Edwards 2000: 2). This
involved the need to ‘listen closely to accounts of ‘‘mundane’’ everyday
domestic activities in detail’ (2000: 2). While women’s experiences constituted an important starting point for my research, the production of
sociological knowledge necessitates that these first person narratives are
theorized. The problem is then one of ensuring that the narrative accounts,
provided by women, are not limited and that these accounts are used
efficaciously.
The design of my study was ultimately motivated by a commitment to
engage with a society which traditionally neglects the role of the private
sphere in reproducing gender inequality. Thus my empirical research was
guided by a studied commitment to making transparent power relationships in personal relationships and family life. Chapters 4 and 5 detail my
empirical findings with respect to time, modern work and gendered subjectivity. Chapter 4 defines masculine and feminine times as elements that
represent multiple differences, pluralities of characteristics that cross and recross the alleged boundary between the two. Chapter 5 uses this alternative
discourse of gendered time to directly challenge the masculine fiction of
unity that is rational work time, and in so doing reveals how this unity has
repressed an Other.

Part III Post-Fordist Times

Harvey (1990) defines post-Fordism as involving a transition from Fordism
to ‘flexible accumulation’, which precipitates the rise of flexible labour
markets and flexible geographies of production. Disaggregated labour
constituted through ‘decentralised forms of labour process and work
organisation’ forms the principal conceptual basis of Neo-Marxist definitions (Hall 1988: 24). Conversely, ‘flexible specialization’ ascribes a more
sanguine role to economic evolution (Piore and Sabel 1984). Transforming


-----

Introduction 21

markets, coupled with the rise of non-specialist, highly flexible manufacturing technologies, are assumed to have enabled smaller batch production and flexible working practices (1984). Elsewhere post-Fordism is
characterized by ‘decentralised management and versatile technologies and
workforces to satisfy increasingly volatile markets’ (Amin 1995b: 2). As
economies of scale are displaced by economies of scope, so flexible specialization evidences heightened competition between firms eager to
capitalize on new market niches. Of course, heightened desire for competitive advantage is not new to market dynamics, but what is new is the
application of flexibility to define the worker.
Flexibility at work infers empowerment and autonomy in the organization of labour time/space. But advances in information technology have
enabled sophisticated methods of regulating the post-Fordist flexible
working space. Often alluding to Orwellian imagery, writers variously
suggest technological advances in the monitoring of the production process, performance and the management of quality, have given rise to
seemingly impenetrable ‘electronic panopticons’ (Sewell and Wilkinson
1992; Fernie and Metcalfe 1997). They eagerly, if not too hastily, draw
attention to the extensive surveillance possibilities of these ‘white-collar
factories’.
The organizational ethnographic research, presented in Chapter 6, significantly challenges technologically deterministic accounts of call centre
labour processes. Chapter 6 details an organizational ethnography carried
out in the call centre of a leading financial services provider. This study was
informed by postmodern research methodologies. Consequently it challenged the notion of determinacy in the products of empirical analyses.
Meanings and actions were less likely to be defined as the determinant
manifestations of intentioned social actors. Rather, our analyses established
new bases for empirical knowledge focusing on the ‘textual strategies’
social actors employ to construct versions of reality (Linstead 1999: 49).
Knowledge is no longer a product of ‘thick description’. Rather, knowledge is relative and fractured as it is dispersed between the realities of
discursively produced ‘selves’.
A central distinction in our postmodern ethnography was the intention
to de-centre the subject of analysis. The subjects of our analysis were not
considered as naturalistic objects of our ethnographic gaze. Rather, we
recognized self, subjectivity and identity as shifting and multivocal. The
subject is constituted ‘through a symbolic system which differentiates and
fixes them in place whilst remaining outside their control’ (Linstead 1999:
59). The consequences of this position for the production of ethnographic
research are profound. In our observations, the organization of the call
centre was not interpreted as a material artefact inhabited by purposeful
subjects. Rather, we perceived the relations between organizational
members as symbolically iterative textual artefact. Organization is written,
and there is no original author (1999: 59). But the textual content of the
organization cannot exist outside of the processes of reading, thus,


-----

22 Gender and work in capitalist economies

organizations depend on the reader or recipient for their existence. In this
sense, the textual existence of organizations evidences their embeddedness
in specific social historical contexts. By emphasizing the sociohistorical
embeddedness of knowledge, our postmodern ethnography challenged
mainstream efforts to provide a unifying reality of surveillance and time
discipline. Our observations focused on the interpretative character of all
knowledge and removed the privileging of the representational model that
characterizes realist ethnography. Forms of knowledge, including realism,
play a large part in determining or legislating what the world consists of
through the various procedures they embody as human practices (Lemert
1994: 56). Conversely, our postmodern ethnography challenged the illusionary detached observer of modernist research. In this sense, our
observations are situated within the uncomfortable space in which
knowledge is no longer a source of fixed meaning.
It was from this methodological position that we empirically defined the
tendency for mainstream writers to neglect gender differentiation in their
analysis of call centre surveillance and the labour process. In so doing, they
fail to recognize the profound implications of a gendered subjectivity and a
masculine-driven interest in transforming self-disciplined individuals into
time-disciplined corporate subjects.

New times?

Formidable changes are occurring in the present-day organization of work,
production and the labour process. The emerging world of flexibility and
‘just-in-time labour’ has invoked systemic disruptions in the sequential
ordering of time/space. Feminists have been less than sanguine in their
resistance to the placeless, timeless logic of ‘just-in-time labour’. The
flexible fragmented present of post-Fordist production is variously argued
to be in contradiction with the embodied social relations through which
women ‘weave’ their own autobiographies. While sympathetic to the
concept of feminine time, its application to the present labour market
context requires intense inquisition and critical reflection. The modern
episteme consisted of a constellation of discourses linked to narrative
realism. This is to appreciate that basic to all forms of gendered subjectivity
is a conscious subject living in time and capable of uniting the literal with
the virtual or linking one temporal order (the present) with others (the past
and future). The ‘timeless times’ and dislocated ‘spatial flows’ of our current era threaten the ability of gendered subjects to form their identities
into sustained narratives. Chapter 7 theorises gender and post-Fordist
flexible specialization. It challenges the fixed, unitary, relational subject of
feminist critique and addresses the problematics of gender and work in the
time/space economy of contemporary ‘just-in-time’ labour.

Introduction 23

Part IV Global Times

In recent decades there have been unprecedented transformations in
capitalist economies of time and space. Capitalism is now global capitalism
and its mode of production ‘shapes social relationships over the entire
planet’ (Castells 2000: 471). It is evident that the more advanced the
capital, the ‘more extensive the market over which it circulates’ (Marx
1973: 539). And the more expansive ‘the spatial orbit of its circulation’, the
greater the necessity for capital to strive for the ‘annihilation of space by
time’ (1973: 539). The global expansion of capitalism is consistent with the
necessity for advanced capital to speed ‘towards the universal development
of the forces of production’ (1973: 540). But the universalizing proclivity
of capital ‘drives it towards dissolution’ (1973: 540). This is because ‘capital
is a limited form of production’ (1973: 540). Nevertheless, global capitalism continues to increase the velocity of circulation and multiply its
value. This suggests the need to re-examine capital’s political economy of
time and its relation to the global distribution of labour.
New technologies enable transnational corporations (TNC) to set up
decentralized production networks, by outsourcing to different parts of the
globe (Peterson and Lewis 1999: 403). Such forms of ‘vertical disintegration’ (Sayer 1989) coincide with a drive towards export-oriented industrialization by Third World nations. Neo-liberal economics is convincing
in its claim that developing nations can only prosper once they have
harnessed their economies to the international division of labour. Indeed,
the integration of Third World labour markets into the global economy has
been axiomatic to a revolution in information technology and the emergence of global textile production. These flexible forms of decentralized
production have precipitated spectacular advances in the velocity of circulating capital. In global capitalism, profit is generated, increasingly in
decentralized production networks embedded ‘in the timeless space’ of the
24-hour global economy (Castells 2000: 472).
In the 24-hour global economy, decentralized production intensifies the
systematic use of subcontracting as a mechanism for ‘deskilling, wage
depression and labour intensification’ (Taplin 1996: 192). This is because
subcontracting establishes patterns of decentralized production, in which
firms can ‘export labour-intensive and low valued-added tasks’ to other
firms integrated in a global hierarchical network (1996: 192). In such
circumstances flexibility means the speedy delivery of goods in working
conditions and where skill development is seen as a costly and timeconsuming luxury. Chapter 8 argues that women are the primary workers
in the global economy’s ‘vertically disintegrated’ (Sayer 1989) methods of
production. This is because the technology used in decentralized production depends on the existence of labour market differentiation among
the skilled and unskilled (Balakrishnan 2002). Firms downsizing and subcontracting to smaller operators create ‘labour market segmentation
between firms in networks’ (Taplin 1996: 192). The extent to which this


-----

24 Gender and work in capitalist economies

segmentation translates into gender segregation depends on the distribution
of skills between the sexes and the resilience of prevailing labour law.
Given that the compulsive logic of ‘vertical disintegration’ is towards the
automation of high skilled, high paid jobs, the emerging labour processes
tends towards a blend of work intensification and low skilled batch production. Consequently, work in these markets ‘is inevitably seen as part of
secondary labor markets, with low pay, few benefits and little job security’
(Taplin 1996: 197). Women are particularly over-represented in these
labour markets. This is because skill distribution is often differentiated by
sex, and on a global scale, most subcontracted, labour-intensive work is
carried out by women, who have historically been marginalized from skill
development training. Of particular concern is the experience of women in
the global textile industry. Chapter 8 provides a case study of the international clothing company, Burberry, and the closure of its textile factory
in Treorchy (Rhondda Valley, South Wales). In March 2007, this plant
was closed and production was relocated to Asia. The case study contains a
detailed document analysis of parliamentary papers and witness evidence
presented by Burberry to the Welsh Affairs Committee. It argues that a
majority of the 309 workers, who lost their jobs, were female and the
relocation of production to plants in Export Processing Zones is directly
linked to the feminization of labour in the ‘new international division of
labour’. Indeed, Chapter 8 argues that globalization precipitates the ‘spatial
degradation’ of the production process. It is a disconcerting fact of contemporary textile manufacturing that accelerated turnover gains have
become increasingly dependent on the exploitation of a spatially disaggregated, feminized global assembly line. It is important, therefore, to
recognise that the 24 hour global economy’s ‘new international division of
labour’, is driven by a reservoir of female labour power. As advances in
information technology accelerate rates of production, to previously
unimaginable levels, this book advances a politics of gender and time.

Accumulation by dispossession

Writers have often romanticized about the experience of the labouring
classes in domestic textile production. Gaskell’s (1836) Artisans and
Machinery contains frequent romantic reminiscences of domestic production and the family division of labour. Gaskell describes how:

removed from many of those causes which universally operate to the
deterioration of the moral character of the labouring man, when
brought into large towns . . . the small farmer, spinner, or handloom
weaver, presented an orderly and respectable appearance. It is true
that the amount of labour gone through was but small, – that the
quantity of cloth or yarn produced was but limited – for he worked
by the rule of his strength and convenience. They were, however,
sufficient to clothe and feed himself and family decently, and
according to their station; to lay by a penny for an evil day, and to
enjoy those amusements and bodily recreations then in being. He was
a respectable member of society; a good father, a good husband, and a
good son.
(Gaskell 1836: 13–4)

Similar nostalgic reminiscence is evident in Engels’ ([1845] 1971) account
of domestic textile production. Prior to the revolution in mechanized
textile production, the spinning and weaving of raw materials were carried
out within the homestead. Engels describes a domestic idyll in which
‘wives and daughters spun the yarn, which the men either wove themselves
or sold to a weaver’ (1971: 9). Substantial numbers of these weavers’
families resided in rural areas and earned enough to subsist. And these
small-scale, pre-capitalist industries, although labour-intensive, offered the


-----

28 Gender and work in capitalist economies

worker ‘a stake in the country’ (1971: 10). Workers owned the instruments
of production and were therefore property owners. In the absence of massmarket demand, working conditions bore little resemblance to the ‘dark
satanic mills’ (Blake [1804] 1991) of factory production. According to
Engels, ‘in those days the demand from the local market, which was virtually the only outlet for cloth, was steady and satisfactory’ (1971: 9).
Home markets operated in equilibrium with population increases, and
consequently demand mirrored the supply of labourers. And work was not
purely an economic activity. In pre-capitalist industry, the worker ‘owned
property and was a step higher in the social scale’ than the labourer in
capitalist production (1971: 10). Rural isolation among pre-industrial
workers markedly reduced the potential for competition, thus limiting
class-based antagonism. These circumstances defined a pre-industrial cultural homogeneity, in which ‘workers enjoyed a comfortable and peaceful
existence’ (1971: 10). Work constituted an extension to communal life and
workers were not subject to the time controls of industrial capitalist production. As Engels observes, ‘they were not forced to work excessive
hours; they themselves fixed the length of their working day and still
earned enough for their needs’ (1971: 10). It is clearly evident that Engels’
observations preference a particular narrative of existence involving benevolent wholesome rural courtship as the basis of village life. Indeed, it is
noticeable that in pre-capitalist societies ‘work, religion, recreation and
amusements, were confined to a small relatively undifferentiated community’ (Smelser 1959: 183). It is also evident that by the eighteenth
century changes were rapidly taking place and these would irreversibly
change the pre-capitalist rhythms of working life. The following extract
contains witness testimony presented to a Select Committee established to
address the petitions of handloom weavers in the early 1830s. The extract
provides an indication of how dispossession was integral to the mechanized
times of industrial textile production:

The Committee understand that you have devoted some time to
statistical inquiry? – I have.

In the course of that inquiry, has your attention been at all directed to
the condition of the handloom weavers? – It has.

What do you consider their condition to be at present time, in
comparison with their condition in former periods, say 40, 30 or 20
years ago, and in comparison with the condition of those employed in
other branches of manufacture and agriculture? – I have their condition to be very bad, as well by some personal acquaintance with
their condition, as by examination of all the evidence that has been
given before Committees of House of Commons within the last 10 or
15 years. I find that they have been getting progressively worse in
condition since 1793, but more uniformly so since the year 1816, and


-----

Primitive accumulation and gendered dispossession 29

worse than any other class of labourers, except the agricultural
labourers in some districts . . .

Have you been led to any conclusion with regard to the cause of the
increased privation which now prevails among the handloom weavers? – I assign the cause mainly to the uncontrolled and extended
application of mechanical power . . . The census of 1831 confirms the
conclusions to which I had been led by that inquiry, which had no
reference to and was formed in ignorance of what that Return would
lead to; but it now proves that the extended application of machinery
has annihilated all the domestic industry or domestic manufacture
which used to prevail among at least from 800,000 to 1,000,000 of
families, and which were carried on, not to a large extent, but to such
an extent as supplied all the domestic comforts of the family.
(Parliamentary Papers 1835: 28)

The enclosure of land and development of capitalist mercantilism privatized hitherto public resources and precipitated ‘a more exacting labour
discipline’ (Thompson 1967: 78). Work now embodied a new time
consciousness which distinguished the employer’s time from the labourer’s
time. Indeed, the enclosure of the commons and early capitalist production
‘were both, in some sense, concerned with the efficient husbandry of the
time of the labour-force’ (1967: 78). The concept of ‘husbandry’ highlights
gender distinction in the articulation of time. Close examination of
primitive accumulation reveals significant gender disparities in the development of capitalist mercantilism. Pre-industrial domestic production was
patriarchal in structure. The father was the head of the family and his craft
defined the household’s domestic trade (Alexander 1989: 40). Each
member of the family participated in the household’s production and thus
contributed to the family income. A distinct gender division of domestic
labour distinguished a woman’s labour within the home from her husband’s. The woman assumed responsibility for the well-being of the family
and ‘her time was allocated between domestic labour and work in production for sale, according to the family’s economic needs’ (1989: 40).
Home was very much a workplace for women and their input to the family
economy was considerable. Nevertheless, the woman’s domestic labour
took precedence over her work in social production and in a patriarchal
culture this was assumed ‘to follow naturally from her role in biological
reproduction’ (1989: 40). But the transfer of production to the market
place irreparably disrupted this equilibrium. For this involved a shift in the
logic of production away from the ‘production for use’ towards the
‘production for exchange’ (1989: 40). This shift in productive activity
linked the ‘production for exchange’ with the private sphere and the
market place. Conversely ‘production for use’ was associated with female
labour and the less culturally recognized private sphere of home and family.
The emergence of industrial capitalism mapped onto these processes, thus
ensuring the economic dependence of women upon the male members of


-----

30 Gender and work in capitalist economies

the household. Of particular relevance were the demise of the handicrafts
system, the rise of the family factory system and the centralization of
capitalist production in industrial times. These events collectively ensured
that ‘women moved into the subordinate and auxiliary positions’ within
the industrial capitalist labour process (1989: 40–1). This chapter argues
that the transition from domestic production to proto-capitalism fostered
gender inequality in capitalism’s emerging political economy of time.

Enclosure and textile production

In the times of Ancient Britons, Romans and Saxons and ever since
the spare moments of the housewife, her maids and daughters had
been devoted to spinning the supposed occupation of our mother eve.
(Trevelyan 1973: 35)

The impetus for the formation of the English textile industry can be traced
back to the arrival of the Cistercian Order in 1138 (Addy 1976). The
Cistercian monks followed an especially strict form of Benedictine rule,
which led them to inhabit uncolonized areas in the north of England and
the Welsh valleys. This land was unsuitable for arable farming, as the soil
was poor and shallow. It was, nevertheless, suitable for sheep grazing and
abbeys were soon able to maintain flocks up to 12,000 in number (1976:
3). The Cistercians soon generated a reputation for the high quality of their
wool, attracting the attention of European merchants. By the mid-twelfth
century, the Cistercians were entering into contracts with local lords so as
to expand their capacities and create new forms of enclosed farming called
granges. Alongside the wool exporters emerged a new class of merchants,
called ‘woolmen’, who travelled to the scattered farms collecting wool,
which they sold to the exporting merchants.
By 1337, the export of wool had become so important that Edward III
(1312–77) used it as a diplomatic weapon against France in the Hundred
Years War. Edward III also mobilized the export of wool as a source of
taxation revenue to fund the war. In order to achieve the efficient collection of duties he designated specific towns to be ‘the centres of the staple
market for wool exports’ (Addy 1976: 4). The Staple was an area where
English goods for export were collected, taxed and sold. By 1390, the
majority of raw wool was exported through the Staple at Calais. The
customs levied on export of raw wool from Calais became a substantial
source of royal revenue, until this centre was captured by the French in
1558. Additional areas designated as staple towns for the collection of wool
included Winchester, York, Lincoln, London, Newcastle and Bristol. King
Edward, in an act of creative taxation, turned to these new Merchant
Staplers to bargain for loans and levies and in return provided these
companies with a monopoly on the export of wool (Trevelyan 1973). King
Edward’s fiscal ingenuity in the creation of mercantile provinces for the


-----

Primitive accumulation and gendered dispossession 31

purposes of taxation is recognized to have contributed to the generative
conditions for English capitalism. As Postan (1939: 165) puts it:

The great breeding season of English Capitalism was in the early
phases of the Hundred Years War, the time when the exigencies of
Royal finance, new experiments in taxation, speculative ventures
with wool, the collapse of Italian finance and the beginning of the
new cloth industry, all combined to bring into existence a new race of
war financiers and commercial speculators, army purveyors and wool
monopolists.

The development of capitalist financiers and public creditors in the wool
trade was later accompanied by the emergence of capitalist organizers of
cloth manufacture. In Ancient Britain, the leisure activities of housewives
was mainly devoted to spinning. Conversely, weaving was practised by
men, who were specially trained as websters to weave cloth in their own
cottage for the local peasantry. By the Middle Ages, the majority of towns
and villages produced cloth of some variety. In the fourteenth century, the
production of standardized cloth began to transfer to the country districts,
particularly to the West regions of England. This was because of the
invention of the fulling stocks, driven by waterpower for the accelerated
finishing of woollen cloth (Addy 1976). Prior to this, the fuller using
human labour; hand, foot and club had carried out one of the central
processes of cloth making. With the invention of the fulling stocks, this
practice was being conducted by waterpower. Consequently, the industry
began to move from the towns towards areas with fast, flowing streams. By
1337, the Cotswold, Pennine valleys and the Lake District were developing a cloth industry, which began to compete seriously with the king’s
investment in East Anglia. Government legislation during the midsixteenth century further strengthened the growth of the cloth industry.
Merchant Adventurers, supported by weavers guilds, lobbied the
Edwardian government to pass the Weaver’s Act of 1553 and later the
Marian Act of 1558. Both of these acts were intended to overcome the
rapacious effects of a decline in the wool trade. It was a condition of these
Acts that weavers in the old towns could not possess more than two looms
each and in rural area weavers were restricted to one loom. Conveniently
these Acts did not apply to the north, thus Manchester, Huddersfield,
Halifax, Leeds and Bradford were exempt from these restrictions and
‘received an impetus to develop their woollen trade’ (1976: 5).
The expansion of the textile industry necessitated new forms of economic organization. A division of labour began to emerge which segregated the textile manufacturing process into specialist crafts – carding,
spinning, weaving, fulling, dyeing and cloth finishing. In 1563, the Statute
of Artificers restricted the practice of the craft to ‘those who had served an
apprenticeship of seven years and empowered the Justices of the Peace to
forbid all engaged in the craft who had not served such an apprenticeship,
to cease manufacture’ (1976: 5). The industry benefited from these quality

controls, but the rapid expansion of the cloth trade for the market, at home
and abroad, inevitably meant that the power of the Craft Guilds would
decline. In place of the local interests of Craft Guilds, emerged the
entrepreneur ‘with a more than local outlook and with money at his
command’ (Trevelyan 1973: 37). The entrepreneur was a central component of the putting-out system. In this system, raw material and
equipment were rented out to the peasant labourer and the half manufactured and finished articles, which were passed on from craftsman to
craftsman from place to place, until marketed and sold. This form of
economic organization needed capital investment. And thus we find the
emergence of the capitalist clothier ‘employing many different people in
many different places’ (1973: 37). By the end of the seventeenth century
most home-based industries operated according to a putting-out system
and artisans were paid according to piece rates. This early stage in the
evolution of the textile industry is often defined as the proto industrial era,
because ‘textile production largely took place in rural cottages’ (Rose 1996:
31). These geographically dispersed rural proto-industrialists ‘were linked
to adjacent areas by a web of mercantile credit’ (1996: 15).

Women and domestic textile production

Merchants from the central towns would distribute materials, on credit, to
the domestic textile labourers. These ‘putters out’ would in turn supply
domestic spinners and weavers who would be paid a piece rate. The
produce was returned to the merchant for finishing, marketing and selling.
This system of production was by no means uniform. Indeed, the individual units of textile production operated asynchronously across the
proto-industry. Patterns of work were governed by an ‘essential conditioning in different notations of time provided by different worksituations and their relation to ‘‘natural rhythms’’ ’ (Thompson 1967: 59).
This is evident when we consider the processual rhythms involved in
domestic spinning:

[D]omestic manufacture used to pervade every labourer’s cottage,
every farmhouse, and the habitations of the handicraftsmen . . . the
labourer’s families were more generally employed in carding and
spinning of wool, given out by the shopkeepers of the villages; and
the yarn, after taken back by them in exchange for the articles of the
shop, passed into other hands to be wove; the farmhouses and the
houses of the handicraftsmen, such as the smiths, carpenters, wheelwrights, and persons of that description, were more generally
employed in the spinning of flax, the yarn of which they afterwards
sent to wove, some for sale and some for domestic use.
(Parliamentary Papers 1835: 28)

In the process of spinning, the raw wool received, by domestic producers,
was first of all segregated into different qualities according to such criteria as

fibre length, strength and softness. The practice of sorting had an interesting gender legacy. According to Busfield (1988), in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries women were assigned the role of ‘wool sorter’. Busfield
quotes a statute legislated in 1554, which declared that ‘the experience of
sorting ‘‘consisteth only in women as clothiers’ wives and their women
servants’’ ’ (1988: 155). However, at some point between the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, wool sorting became a task undertaken by men.
This coincided with the growing organization of the wool trade and the
transition from the family-based preparation of raw material for production
to the sorting of raw materials by male workshop-based employees. Having
monopolized the occupation, men secured this control by restricting access
to apprenticeships and ‘refusing to impart their skill to women’ (1988:
155).
Nevertheless, women undertook virtually all the intermediate stages of
the production process. Thus they were involved in scouring the raw
wool, removing foreign matter and opening out the cotton fibres. The
central aim, of this latter stage, was to disentangle the wool mass so as to
produce a roll (or carding) of a sufficiently even density (Rose 1996). A
pair of cards (an instrument for combing wool) would be used to straighten
the fibres into a manageable sliver for spinning. The process of spinning the
cardings involved teasing out the fibres (drafting), while simultaneously
twisting them together (Figure 1.1). The spun thread was continuously
wound onto a bobbin held by a spindle or directly onto the spindle so as to

form ‘a cop – a cylinder of yarn with conical ends’, which was fitted onto
the weaver’s shuttle (1996: 31). Spinning was generally recognized as
woman’s work along with carding, doubling and hanking, and the two
finishing processes of burling and mending (Busfield 1988: 155). Men were
invariably employed in the initial stages of wool sorting. Men also specialized in the finishing processes, which involved willeying and fettling,
scouring and milling, raising the nap and shearing, pressing and packing.
And, virtually all aspects of weaving were designated to men.
In summary, the typical textile family, in the mid-eighteenth century
was involved in a putting-out system. It was unusual for a cotton weaver to
be self-employed; the majority of weaving families relied upon merchant
agents for the acquisition of equipment, raw materials and the sale of cloth.
And yet the family maintained a certain degree of isolation as a productive
unit. According to Smelser, the father was the ‘occupational head’ of the
family and specialized in the co-ordination of the weaving process (1959:
183). The apprentice system had largely disappeared by the 1700s, leaving
fathers to assume responsibility for training their sons in the art of weaving.
In the domestic system, women were responsible for spinning and preparatory activities. It was this stage of the textile production process, which
first felt the impact of technological innovation. This is because the period
between 1740 and 1770 was pronounced by a fecundity of inventions
designed to improve methods of spinning.

Textile innovation and the subject of dispossession

The invention of the steam engine, and of machines for weaving and
spinning, in the mid-eighteenth century, transformed Britain from being a
primarily agricultural society to an industrial nation (Engels [1845] 1971).
These early technical innovations ‘gave the impetus to the genesis of an
industrial revolution’ (1971: 9). Of particular relevance was the creation of
the spinning jenny, which was patented by James Hargreaves in 1770. The
spinning jenny complemented the technological improvement to looms
achieved in 1733 by John Kay’s flying shuttle. Legend has it that Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny after having observed an occasion in
which his wife’s spinning wheel had become upset on the floor. He was
thus inspired to produce a machine driven with multiple upright spindles
(Quennell and Quennell 1933). In contrast to its more cumbersome predecessors, a single individual could operate the spinning jenny and the
inclusion of multiple spindles enabled it to produce more yarn. Richard
Arkwright’s water-powered frame (patented in 1769) and Samuel
Crompton’s mule (invented 1774–9) later accompanied the introduction
of the spinning jenny.
Smelser argues that these innovations in hand operated textile
machinery, initially, ‘merely rearranged labour within the domestic system’
(1959: 184). This is particularly evident with regards to the spinning jenny,


-----

which was sufficiently small enough to be located in the cottages of
labourers, or in adjacent workshops (Chapman 1987). The improved hand
operated spinning machines were, indeed, initially small enough to remain
in the home. But the extent to which the cottage jenny merely reshuffled
the division of labour requires critical analysis. It would appear that
Smelser’s observations regarding continuity in the social structure of the
family, was defined solely in terms of the ‘occupational head’ of the family.
Indeed, three premises concerning the ‘occupational head’ guide Smelser’s
observations. First, he argues that the family’s primary earning power, ‘at
least after 1780’, continued to reside with the husband in either his capacity
as spinner or weaver (1959: 185). Second, the new cottage machines
appeared not to have disrupted ‘the traditional relationship between father
and son’ (1959: 185). According to Smelser, ‘in either spinning or weaving
the father continued to instruct his son in the trade’ (1959: 185). Ultimately the domestic system was able to withstand the potential structural
disruptions presented by hand operated machines, because the family
economy continued to be based in the homestead, albeit under the continued supervision of the patriarch.
Smelser’s account of the family’s structural form, during its transition
from domestic production to its entrance into the factory system, has been
the subject of significant critical reflection. Of particular interest is Edwards
and Lloyd-Jones’s (1973) critical challenge, entitled N.J. Smelser and the
Cotton Factory Family: A Reassessment. First of all, they claim that Smelser’s
account of the first stage in textile industrialization (from 1770–90) is
premised on inconsistent data. Smelser’s observations regarding the father’s
continued role in the instruction of their son in ‘either spinning or
weaving’ failed to recognize that prior to the advent of factory spinning,
child spinners were instructed by females (Edwards and Lloyd-Jones 1973:
305). This challenge is supported by Pinchbeck (1969) in her examination
of Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution. She uses historical evidence to
confirm that the father administered the weaving and the mother had
primary responsibility for preparatory processes, including the training and
setting to work of infants. Engels also describes how, in the domestic textile
industry, ‘wives and daughters spun the yarn which the men either wove
themselves or sold to a weaver’ (1971: 9). Thus it can be discerned that in
the domestic system it was women who specialized in spinning and
assumed the responsibility for instructing children in their daily tasks. It was
only with the advent of the factory system that there appeared marked
increases in the numbers of males involved in spinning.
This inaccuracy in Smelser’s (1959) account of the initial stages in the
textile revolution is consistent with a level of gender myopia throughout
his analysis. Female experiences, while not entirely neglected, are defined
in relation to their male counterparts. The apparent partnership between
the sexes, within the domestic system of family production, was actually
segregated according to a hierarchy of gender roles. Women were designated as providing the ‘unskilled work’ while males were assumed to be


-----

engaged in the ‘skilled work’ (Holloway 2005: 27). It is argued that the
calibration of skill derived not from technical difference in the complexity
of work, but rather as part of the patriarchal control that a man possessed
over his family who were his co-workers. The factory system emerged
within the interstices of these traditional working structures, which made it
possible to further refine the gender division of labour.
Prior to the technical innovations in hand operated machines, weavers
needed to keep several female spinners busy to sustain a steady flow of yarn.
Indeed, it has been said that before innovations in the mechanization of
spinning ‘the force of custom prevented men from engaging in any
appreciable numbers in what was regarded as women’s work’ (Busfield
1988: 157). Men assumed the task of spinning only when innovations in
spinning, at first, produced machines which demanded considerable
strength and skill. Smelser recognizes these shifts in the patterns of female
labour. Thus, he details how ‘through 1780 the jennies increased the gains
of females in a family and of the family in general’ (1959: 184). Smelser
accurately claims that thereafter ‘women were displaced by the waterframe factories and the skilled male jenny mule operatives’ (1959: 184). For
some time these males were ascribed the status of an ‘aristocracy of spinners’. This accolade was also partly due to the fact that these spinners had
previously been weavers who had invested capital in the new spinning
machines. The accumulated affect of these changes was to eclipse the
female hand spinner who ‘by the nineteenth century had disappeared
almost entirely’ (1959: 184).
Nevertheless, for Smelser, the demise of the female hand spinner is of
little relevance to the ‘social structure’ of the family economy. Thus
Smelser is able to make the unusual claim that ‘the period between 1780
and 1790 was a ‘golden age’ for the domestic spinner; his earnings
increased, but the structure of his employment remained the same’ (1959:
185). Here as elsewhere, Smelser appears oblivious to the economic disadvantages experienced by female textile labourers. In 1778, a Sisterhood
of Hand Spinners at Leicester petitioned Parliament in defiance of the
factory system stating that:

The business of spinning in all its branches hath ever been time out of
mind the peculiar employment of women; insomuch that every single
woman is called in law a spinster . . . it is with great concern your
petitioners see that this ancient employment is likely to be taken from
them . . . This we apprehend will be the consequence of so many
spinning mills, now erecting after the model of cotton mills.
(Davies 1975: 53)

Innovations in spinning technology had precipitated a contraction of the
domestic spinning industry and the displacement of female hand spinners.
And this condition of dispossession was accentuated by the emergence of
the ‘jenny factories’ and the ‘family factory’ system of manufacture, which
were pervasive from 1770 to 1790.

Jenny factories

Traditional histories of textile production, focus on Richard Arkwright’s
factory system as the first major innovation in the organization of industrial
production. In fact, the economic organization of industrial production
first occurred in insignificant places, such as ‘jenny factories’ and ‘mills’,
which emerged in the first quarter of the eighteenth century. The spinning
jenny initially augmented the system of family-based production. The early
versions of the jenny could be operated without motor power, occupied
little space and thus could easily be fitted into existing domestic working
patterns. Outwardly the early models of the spinning jenny presented little
challenge to the organization of the industry. But this is not to assume that
experimentation and innovations in the organization of the jenny were
limited to the operatives in their homes (Edwards and Lloyd-Jones 1973:
306). It has been proposed that prior to the full-scale establishment of the
factory system there existed factories, which operated jennies and were
organized in hamlets ‘where the factory would form the nucleus around
which villages formed’ (1973: 306). Wadsworth and Mann observed the
rapid growth of jenny factories during the decade 1770–80:

Arkwright’s achievement was to apply power to the whole sequence
of the operations of carding and spinning, which became a continuous
process carried on under one roof. The numerous mills which were
springing up, especially in Lancashire, at the same time that his factories were being established, were more varied in character. The
carding engine, which was coming rapidly into use after 1770, usually
formed the nucleus of these undertakings. In its first crude forms it
was capable of being employed as a domestic machine to be turned by
hand, and it found a place in the warehouse of the manufacturer, who
could give out the cardings to be roved and spun by domestic workers
. . . The great demand for cotton warps, created first by velvet
manufacture, and then by calico manufacture which Arkwright
brought into existence . . . gave strong inducement for the small
capitalist to add spinning jennies, twisting and warping mills. No
inconsiderable part of the cotton twist for the large production of
velvets that is reflected in the export returns for the later seventies,
must have been furnished by these new carding and jenny mills, since
at that date Arkwright’s factories were hardly numerous enough to
have met the demand. Weft spinning remained for the most part a
domestic operation performed on the single spindle or the smaller
jennies. These carding and jenny mills were of all sizes, from the small
shop with nothing but a hand card engine, to the most elaborately
organized factory in which all the operations from the cleaning and
picking of cotton to warping were carried on and in which horse or
water power was used.’
(Wadsworth and Mann 1931: 492)

38 Gender and work in capitalist economies

It is important to emphasize that these factories operated outside the home
and in so doing transferred gender inequalities, evident in the family
economy, to the factory system. This proposition derives, by extension,
from Smelser’s claim that the advent of the spinning jenny ‘eclipsed the
female hand spinner, who by the beginning of the nineteenth century had
disappeared almost entirely’ (1959: 184). Given the direct links between
the arrival of machine spinning and the decline of the female hand spinner,
it is plausible that the general application of the spinning jenny in factories
accelerated the plight of the wife who ‘became more secondary economically’ (1959: 184). The gender division of labour was beginning to
exert financial penalties on the female members of the family and further
developments in manufacturing technology were having similar effects.

Family factories and time-disciplined production

When James Hargreaves took out the patent for the spinning jenny in
1770, the initial design had the potential capacity for 16 spindles, in 1784,
Hargreaves had increased this capacity to 80 spindles (Edwards and LloydJones 1973: 307). A consequence of the increased spindle capacity was to
make the jenny too expensive, large and cumbersome for domestic
workers. This development in machine manufacture encouraged the further transition of textile manufacturing away from the domestic sphere.
Smelser observes that the waterframe and the mill followed the invention
of the domestic jenny (Smelser 1959: 185). One of the earliest mills
appeared in 1704, and was established by Thomas Cotchett of London,
who obtained a lease from the Mayor and Corporation of Derby to erect a
silk spinning mill (Addy 1976). Further enquiry into the types of manufacturing accommodation, categorized as a ‘mill’, reveals some rather
ambiguous arrangements. In its early inception ‘the word mill sometimes
meant no more than a machine which performs its work by rotary motion’
(Valenze 1995: 88). But this ambiguous arrangement was soon to change as
mill production attracted increased capital investment. Shrewd entrepreneurs were efficaciously adapting textile technology to the mill setting.
Mills had, of necessity, to be built where there was access to a powerful
stream of water. Such preconditions saw the development of mills in
narrow parts of valleys where there was a strong fall of water to power the
waterframe. Consequently the mills were a large distance from the
industrial centres ‘often in small hamlets where the supply of labour was a
problem and communications frequently difficult’ (Addy 1976: 25).
These remote conditions prompted the enterprising mill owner towards
the need for a ‘disciplined and punctual working force, which could appear
at a set time to maintain continuos production of cotton yarn’ (Addy 1976:
25). According to Addy, ‘the habits of the native inhabitants of these river
valleys had to be changed from those of ignorant, rough men and women
who worked when they desired and served no master but themselves’
(1976: 25). Though domestic production was labour-intensive and


-----

Primitive accumulation and gendered dispossession 39

arduous, labourers were less subject to time-disciplined production. It has
been suggested that a labourer could select their working times and that
‘the relationships between employer and employee were personal and not
bound by rigid rules and regulations’ (Addy 1976: 30). Some indication of
this relation to time and work is evident in the following extract from a
parliamentary report published in 1840:

The domestic weaver is apt to be irregular in his habits, because he
does not work under the eye of a master. At any moment the
domestic weaver can throw down his shuttle, and convert the rest of
the day into a holiday, or busy himself with some more profitable
task; but the factory weaver works under superintendence; if absent a
day, without sufficient cause, he is dismissed, and his place supplied by
one of greater power of application. One hundred webs, therefore, in
a factory of hand-loom weavers, would be finished, even in Manchester, in the time in which 50 would not be finished by an equal
number of domestic weavers.
Parliamentary Papers (1840: 10)

E.P. Thompson’s (1967) seminal essay ‘Time, Work-Discipline and
Industrial Capitalism’ identifies the transition from domestic production to
industrial production, in the eighteenth century, as having created a radical
disruption to the qualitative rhythms of artisan craft-based work.
Thompson argues that the rise of industrial capitalism precipitated a
marked transformation in the dominant ‘task-oriented’ temporal consciousness, towards a greater synchronization of labour and more exact
time routines. These changes entailed the internalization of a more rational,
quantitative ‘time orientation’ to labour and life. Thrift and abstemiousness
were enjoined on all workers as the new time ethic combined with a
Protestant work ethic to produce a utilitarian economic approach to time.
To this extent, ‘economy became the watchword; saving time, avoiding
waste and fraud, eliminating inconvenience’ – these were the vital
imperatives of the new manufacturing age (Valenze 1995: 88). But factory
owners faced a fundamental difficulty in implementing a regime of work
time discipline. Unskilled workers, in particular, disliked the protracted
uninterrupted shifts in the mills and were averse to similarities between the
early factories and the parish workhouse (Chapman 1987: 46). Comparisons between the two forms of institution related specifically to ‘the
insistence in both on close and continuous supervision of work by overseers’ (1987: 46). A consequence of this abhorrence to the disciplined
schedule of factory life was that, in its early stages, the vast proportion of
factory workers were casual labourers.
The ‘restless and migratory spirit’ of mill workers troubled employers
(Chapman 1987: 46). Richard Arkwright responded to the new challenge
of time-disciplined production, by building houses for whole families and
so creating new communities which could be acculturated into the clock
time of industrial capitalism (Addy 1976: 25). Mary Rose (1996) in her


-----

40 Gender and work in capitalist economies

account of the Lancashire Cotton Industry, describes how in the 1820s and
1830s, many rural mill owners ‘really began community building in earnest
. . . in so doing they created a community-based labour market which they
controlled’ (1996: 23). Mill owners were determined to counteract the
time work patterns of domestic production. In an attempt to inculcate a
time-disciplined relation to work, among labourers, mill owners set about
creating family-based communities, which determined the organization of
work. Similar observations are provided by Smelser. As he describes:

Two sets of wage books illustrate this invasion of family standards into
the manufactory. In the spinning mill of Robert Peel and his partners
near Bury, very few of the 136 persons employed as free labour in
1801–2 were adult males. Ninety-five of the 136, however, belonged
to twenty-six families, showing the opportunity for members of the
same family to gather on the premises. Furthermore in every case [that
employees took labour only on a casual basis] no other member of
their families was employed there . . . their employment was very
irregular and stands in striking contrast to the steady work of the
majority of the families.
(Smelser 1959: 185)

Such patterns of family employment not only augmented the household
income but also ‘allowed for the presence of a parent with the children
during working hours’ (Smelser 1959: 185). This, according to Smelser,
was a vital condition preventing ‘the family from disintegrating into a mere
aggregate of individuals in a free labour market’ (1959: 188). The departure
of textile production from the homestead had ‘threatened to disperse the
family through the factories at the cost of its tradition and its solidarity’
(1959: 188). This wave of change was compounded by the influx of
women and children into the workplace which had ‘weakened the traditional domestic basis for child-rearing’ (1959: 188). According to Smelser,
the presence of women and children within the textile labour force also
challenged the male as the main breadwinner. Furthermore it undermined
the father’s ability ‘to train his children for a trade’ (1959: 188). The
employment of families as communities stemmed the demise in the
patriarchal role of the father. In this arrangement, the factory became a
community. The interests of the family functioned to discipline the conduct of employees and also provided a reserve army of child labourers.
Alongside these employment structures existed the activities of humanitarian masters ‘who provided several correctives – welfare, education,
recreation, etc.’ (1959: 188). According to Smelser, the combined effect of
family employment and humanitarian education was to produce ‘a network of controls based upon kinship and community bonds’ which ‘permeated the apparently impersonal factory’ (1959: 191). Certainly the
employment of entire families went some way towards ameliorating the
depersonalization and differentiation of the free labour market. But it needs
to be recognized that it was also efficacious for the mill owner to employ


-----

Primitive accumulation and gendered dispossession 41

parents and relatives as a corrective in the maintenance of a timedisciplined workforce. Furthermore, adult males were often hired as
‘occupational head’ of the family and given the skilled jobs. These adult
males would then hire immediate members of their family as assistants to
‘work as piecers and scavengers’ and there was a tendency for the adult
male to select his wife and children to carry out these menial roles
(Edwards and Lloyd-Jones 1973: 311). Consequently the male could
continue to occupy his ‘authoritative position as head of the family’ (1973:
311).

Conclusion

As industrial change continued, entrepreneurs began to establish spinning
factories, which were driven by water power (Engels [1845] 1971: 14).
These innovations in spinning technology expanded unabated throughout
the eighteenth century. Social commentators remonstrated about the
relentless march of machine technology and the abandonment of hand
techniques. Engels described the application of mechanical power as having
‘brought about the victory of the machine over the hand worker in the
main branches of British Industry’ (1971: 14). For Engels, ‘the history of
the hand-workers has been one of continued retreat in the face of the
advance of the machine’ (1971: 14).
The transition to mechanical production was well advanced by the early
nineteenth century bringing with it huge increases in output and production. Cotton production had become the main pillar of Britain’s
industrial profile and the expansion of mechanization had strengthened the
competitive presence of British industry in foreign markets. But this
process also had the effect of accelerating the ‘growth in the numbers of the
proletariat’ (Engels [1845] 1971: 15). As weaving became a more profitable
industry, part-time weavers disappeared ‘and were absorbed into the class
of full-time industrial workers, who had no links with the soil either as
owners or tenants of smallholdings’ (1971: 10). To this extent, labourers
within the textile industry became ‘purely members of the proletariat’.
‘The industrial worker no longer owned any of the means of production,
and they lost all security of employment’ (1971: 15). And with the
introduction of power, ‘the workers became machine minders rather than
machine operatives’ (Chapman 1987: 17). Chapter 2 argues that the
transition from family factories to depersonalized mechanized systems of
textile production generated gendered social consequences, which were ‘of
a far-reaching character’ (Engels [1845] 1971: 15).

Time, work-discipline and the textile revolution (1750–1870)

In the 1800s, the great cotton mills of the Midlands and North of England
became the heartland of Britain’s Industrial Revolution. The cotton
industry was the ‘most important branch of industry’ (Engels [1845] 1971:
15). In the early 1800s, the percentage of British industrial output constituted by the cotton industry had grown from an annual rate of 12.76 per
cent in the 1780s to 17 per cent in 1801 (Rose 1996: 26). From 1771 to
1775 the average amount of raw cotton imported into Britain, annually,
was £5 million (Engels [1845] 1971: 15). In 1841, the importation of
cotton amounted to £528 million, and by 1860 it had risen to £1000
million (Thomson 1971: 13). In the industrial textile mills, raw cotton was
spun and woven by steam-driven machinery capable of vastly exceeding
the productive capacities of domestic manufacturing. Engels notes that in
1834 ‘76½ million lb. of cotton yarn and cotton hosiery to the value of
£1,200,000 sterling’ was being produced in English factories (1971: 15).
During this time the British cotton industry employed over 8 million
mules spindles, 110,000 power looms and 260,000 handlooms.
The transition to mechanical production was well advanced by the early
nineteenth century bringing with it huge increases in output and production. Cotton production had developed into one of the main pillars of
Britain’s industrial profile and the expansion of mechanical production had
strengthened the competitive presence of British industry in foreign
markets. But this process also accelerated the growth in the numbers of the

proletariat. As weaving was transformed into a more profitable industry,
part-time weavers were absorbed into the category of full-time industrial
workers who had no links with the means of agricultural production. Thus
labourers in the textile industry became purely members of the proletariat.
In its early stages, mechanization set in motion marked transformations
in the content and profile of the textile industry’s labour force. It was
against this background that women’s increased participation in textile
manufacture was observed to be a new social phenomenon. As Gaskell
notes, ‘that adult male labour having been found difficult to manage, and
not more productive – its place has, in great measure, been supplied by
children and women’ (1836: 147). For many social commentators,
increases in female labour market activity were merely an extension of the
home-based skills that women traditionally assumed. It was customary for
spinning to be carried out in the homestead using a spindle wheel. In this
context, the handicraft of spinning merely consisted of two primary
motions involving the stretching and twisting of combed cotton fibres.
Women assumed responsibility for spinning and for the most part the
output of spinners matched the demands of domestic weavers. With the
invention of John Kay’s flying shuttle, in 1733, there occurred a speeding
up of the weaving process, which produced a technological imbalance
between the capacities of spinners and the yarn required by weavers (Rose
1996: 39). Concerns regarding the economic impact of this technological
imparity prompted the Royal Society of Arts to offer financial rewards for
the invention of a loom capable of doubling a weaver’s output and a
spinning machine which would mechanize hand spinning (1996: 39). The
resulting innovations in spinning and weaving machinery required considerable physical strength and this for Engels provided the basis as to why
‘men began to replace women as spinners’ (1971: 13). Technological
developments in textile machinery later redressed this gender ratio in
favour of female employers. To this extent Gaskell observed that a change
was rapidly occurring in the profile of the operative ‘and a disposition is
developing itself to have recourse to the labour of women and children in
preference to adults’ (1836: 143). Technology removed the need for
strength and, for Gaskell, this coincided with the employment of women as
a cheap source of labour. In the new era of machine production, labour
had become ‘a subsidiary to this power’. Of particular contention was the
plight of the male operative ‘he is condemned, hour after hour, day after
day, to watch and minister to its operations – to become himself as much a
part of its mechanism as its cranks and cog-wheels’ (1836: 143). But Gaskell
was particularly perturbed by the denigration of a sexual division of labour
which had:

the effect of rendering adult labour of no greater value than that of the
infant or girl; the workmen are reduced to mere watchers, and suppliers of the wants of machinery, requiring in the great majority of its
operations no physical or intellectual exertion; and the adult male has

usual order of things were dependent upon him for their support.
(Gaskell 1836: 144)

Some historical evidence supports Gaskell’s observations linking advances
in mechanical production with the displacement of male textile operatives.
In 1764, James Hargreaves revolutionized spinning technology with the
invention of the spinning jenny. Adoption of the spinning jenny spread
rapidly and by 1770, it had displaced its predecessor, the hand wheel
(Edwards and Lloyd-Jones 1973: 306). The spinning jenny was mainly
suitable for the production of coarse yarn and unsuited for producing very
fine fibre. The latter continued to be spun on the one tread-wheel until, in
the late eighteenth century, Richard Arkwright’s waterframe developed to
successfully produce a fine cotton warp thread. Arkwright technologically
developed his spinning machine in Lancashire and instituted the first
operational system in Nottingham (Palmer and Neaverson 1994). Arkwright later transferred the operational processes of the waterframe into
large-scale premises in Manchester, which by 1782 employed over five
thousand people (Pike 1966: 33). The beginnings of the factory system are
often traced back to this period. Indeed, historians repeatedly cite Arkwright’s business model as the typical factory form of the Industrial
Revolution (Edwards and Lloyd-Jones 1973). It appears, however, that the
waterframe considerably deskilled spinning. Busfield describes the operator’s job as ‘simply to replenish the silvers, piece together the broken ends
and remove the bobbins when filled with yarn’ (1988: 157). The decreased
necessity for skilled labour gradually yielded to the potential capital gains
derived from employing women and children. Their nimble agility was
deemed more suited to the delicate process of mending broken threads and
removing bobbins.
The social dislocation of male operatives traced similar patterns in the
development of Crompton’s mule. Samuel Crompton, in circa 1779,
combined the technical features of Hargreaves’ spinning jenny with the
variable speed rollers of Arkwright’s waterframe to produce the Crompton
mule. The early model of the mule was constructed out of wood and
carried 20 spindles. These features enabled the first mule to be small
enough to use in a cottage (Addy 1976: 21). Between 1825 and 1830,
further innovations in the design of the mule transformed it into a fully
automatic machine. Up until the 1790s, women and children had been
employed to operate the light mule in rural factories (Honeyman 2000:
59). Thereafter the emergence of steam-driven mules required a degree of
skill and considerable manual operation. Consequently, early generations
of Crompton’s mule offered employment to male artisanal workers in
urban mills. In due course mule spinners became renowned as the ‘elite
among factory workers’ (Busfield 1988: 158). However, advances in mule
design soon challenged this accolade. In the 1830s the self-acting mule was
invented and it greatly simplified the spinning process, indeed, it is

observed that its inventors ‘believed that it would henceforth be operated
by women and children’ (1988: 158).
Parliamentary reports, derived from the ninetieth century, provide
further indication of the dynamics of female labour and male displacement
in textile factory production. According to Gaskell, in 1816, official statistical reports, derived from 41 Scottish textile mills, returned a total of
10,000 workers (1836: 142). Some 1370 of these were males aged 18 or
younger, while 3034 were females aged 18 or younger. Statistical returns
for Scotland, after the Factory Act of 1833, showed no decline in the
proportion of female textile workers. In 1835, Scotland had 170 flax mills,
which employed 13,409 labourers of whom 3392 were males and 10,017
were females. It was noted that female labourers constituted ‘about 75 per
cent of the whole’ (Parliamentary Papers 1898: 15). Similar patterns were
evident in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1835, there were 65 flax mills
in this area employing 9378 labours, of whom 3603 were adult males and
young boys and 5775 women and girls (Parliamentary Papers 1898: 61). By
1851, 635,000 women were employed in textile factories in Great Britain
(Hollis 1979: 53).
Parliamentary reports, derived from the nineteenth century, also contain
some limited analysis of gender segregation survey data. In 1898, the
Labour Department, Board of Trade presented to both Houses of Parliament, a report entitled Changes in the Employment of Women and Girls in
Industrial Centres. A central conclusion of this report was that there was no
evidence of employment displacement of males by females in the weaving
factory. Rather, the report suggests that developments in weaving technology precipitated a natural sex division of labour. It was the advocacy, by
men, of this sexual division of labour which encouraged the increased
labour market participation of women. Such conclusions are evident in the
following extract derived from the 1898 report:

The hand-loom weavers were antagonistic to the factory system, but
given power looms to be worked, they seem to have regarded it as a
matter of course that they should be worked by women. The only
grievance against women in the matter was that they were willing to
go to the factory, whereas the men strenuously opposed themselves to
the inevitable, and tried to preserve their independence of an overseer
in working at their own homes. They sent their girls and boys to the
mills, because they could not afford to refuse the higher wages that
children could earn there; but the preference for girls as weavers
rather than boys was probably due to the preference of boys for the
domestic loom.
(Parliamentary Papers 1898: 31)

It is evident from this extract that the transition from domestic production
to the factory system entailed a transfer of customary cultural codes
defining the sexual division of labour. It is also evident, from the 1898
parliamentary report, that the mass employment of women was axiomatic

to the development of textile factory production. What is less evident is
recognition of this increased female labour market participation as inextricably linked to transformations in capitalism’s political economy of time.

Economies of time and space in factory production

Primitive accumulation involved the extension of capital into noncapitalist sectors and the subjugation of domestic manufacture to the rule of
capital. It was the invasion of primitive economies which bolstered capitalist accumulation and offset a declining rate of profit. At first, substantial
capital gains were achieved simply by the enclosure of land and possession
of natural resources. Over time, labour required to transform these
resources into capital was provided by the local dispossessed peasantry. But
the quantitative expansion of capital, without technological change,
inevitably reaches its limitations as it exhausts labour supply and material
resources. In these instances capital is compelled to channel investment into
technological innovation. The revolutionary era of machine-based factory
production provided capital with a powerful means for intensifying the
productivity of labour ‘i.e., for shortening the working-time required in
the production of a commodity’ (Marx Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 380).
Given this capacity, it is puzzling why those industries first ‘invaded’ by
machines directed their use to ‘lengthening the working-day beyond all
bounds set by human nature’ (2003: 380). An examination into this
peculiar political economy of time provides some indication as to why the
initial stages of factory production excited ‘capital’s appetite for the labour
of others’ (2003: 380).
Machinery has the capacity to automate labour and transform its
implements into objects operating independently of the labourer. To this
extent, machinery exists as an ‘industrial perpetuum mobile’ that would
produce indefinitely if not for the natural barriers presented by the human
body (2003: 380). Capital is thus directed to pursue innovations, which
reduce to a minimum the resistance presented by the visceral body.
Additional resistances to the machine’s perpetuum mobility arise from
built-in obsolesce. The efficiency of the machine as a productive unit is
‘inversely proportional to the value transferred by it to the product’ (2003:
380). The longer the lifetime of the machine, ‘the greater is the mass of the
products over which the value transmitted by the machine is spread, and
the less is the portion of that value added to each single commodity’ (2003:
381). This is because the operational lifetime of the machine is conditional
on the degree of material wear and tear accumulated throughout the
duration of the working day. Obsolescence is appended by technological
change in the industrial sector and the development of cheaper more
advanced machinery. In these circumstances, ‘its value is no longer
determined by the labour actually materialised in it, but by the labour-time
requisite to reproduce either it or the better machine’ (2003: 381). Consequently, the greater the scope of time required for the machine to


-----

Weaving time 47

achieve its total value, the increased risk that newer models will materialize
and render it obsolete. Industrial capitalism’s rigid economies of time and
space presented capital with few options other than to lengthen the
working day and thus reduce the period of time in which a machine can
actualize its value. Such practices distinguished absolute surplus value
extraction and corresponded with the historical development of factory
production. For it was ‘in the early days of the life of machinery that this
special incentive to the prolongation of the working-day makes itself felt
most astutely’ (2003: 382).

Gender time and factory production

Although automation produces a dynamic acceleration of the productive
forces, ‘surplus value arises from variable capital alone’ (Marx Capital, Vol.
1 [1887] 2003: 383). Conversely, machinery represents constant capital.
The evolution of the factory system precariously adumbrated an increasing
rate of constant capital. Lengthening the working day countenanced a
declining rate of profit by allowing production ‘on an extended scale
without any alteration in the amount of capital laid out on machinery and
buildings’ (2003: 382). But this substitution of dead labour for living labour
is in turn dependent on the continual use of machinery. This provided
industry with a powerful incentive to open out ‘to the capitalist new strata
of the working-classes’ (2003: 384). Indeed, machine production was an
accrescent force, ‘enrolling, under the direct sway of capital, every member
of the workman’s family, without distinction of age or sex’ (2003: 372).
Hence the remarkable change in the history of textile factory employment
in which women and children are ‘compelled to submit to the dictation of
capital’ (2003: 384).
Attention to time in the analysis of factory production also highlights
how ‘the most powerful instrument for shortening labour-time, becomes
the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourer’s time
. . . at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of
his capital’ (2003: 384). This chapter historically examines the intensification of labour induced by the factory system. Absolute surplus value
extraction was based on an immoderate expansion of the working day. It
entailed the habituation of labour to a more intensified degree of labour for
an excessive duration of time. Its apparatus is directed at achieving synchronization to the chronometric rhythms of capitalist production.
Nevertheless, its consequences were partial as they required the expansion
of labour time, to a degree attainable only through the time-disciplined
exploitation of a special class of worker, i.e., women.

Weaving time in nineteenth-century textile production

Adam Smith (1937) demonstrated in The Wealth of Nations that the
maximum economies in manufacturing flowed from the ‘division of
labour’. He illustrated this by describing the manufacturing system of a pin
factory which employed 16 different processes and workers. It is evident
that Smith regarded the early forms of textile manufacturing as ‘essentially
an extension of household work’ (Harte and Ponting 1973: 2). Smith
observed that towards the end of the fifteenth century, labour within the
English cloth industry ‘was probably much less subdivided . . . than it is at
present’ (Harte and Ponting 1973: 2). Undoubtedly the various stages of
domestic textile production subdivided into processes so as to provide
work for members of the family economy. But it wasn’t until steam power
was harnessed to the new innovations in spinning that the factory system
actually did supersede the proto-industry in textile production. The power
requirements of the cotton industry were initially relatively modest, and up
until the 1820s water wheels satisfied most of the power demands for the
industry (Chapman 1987: 18). By the middle of the nineteenth century,
water wheels were increasingly unable to meet the productivity demands
of increased competition and new more advanced textile technology. In
previous times, local shortages of water power would compel factory
owners to transfer to locations where water was plentiful. Innovations in
fixed industrial machinery made such business processes prohibitively more


-----

Weaving time 49

expensive. Consequently significant energy was being exerted to produce
power resources, which enabled factory owners to remain on their existing
sites. Innovations in steam-driven mills largely responded to these
demands. Newcomen’s steam engine, developed in the first decade of the
eighteenth century, was already being employed in the majority of mining
districts. However, it was James Watt’s rotary steam engine which precipitated the real breakthrough in steam-powered textile production.
The expansion of the steam-driven mill brought with it significant
transformations in the spatial organization of production. The traditional
narrow mill buildings, constructed to accommodate spinning jennies, were
unsuitable for large steam-driven machines which meant that new
economies of space had to be built into factory design. Moreover, the
installation of steam engines meant that factory owners were no longer
confined to the valley regions where water supply was plentiful. The
revolution of steam power made possible the development of large-scale
factories, which ‘moved closer to the coalfields and the centres of population, so giving rise to the black industrial Victorian ‘‘toadstools’’ ’ (Addy
1976: 26). The factories themselves attracted ‘extraordinary bursts’ in
population distribution (Smelser 1959: 193). Between 1821 and 1831, the
population of Lancashire increased by 300,000 an increase of 27 per cent
(1959: 193). During the same period Manchester increased its population
from 154,807 to 227,808, an estimated increase of 47 per cent (1959: 193).
Additional industrial changes, accentuating the establishment of large-scale
production, included the emergence of combined spinning and weaving
firms. This combination of business processes emerged with the expansion
of power loom weaving between 1825 and 1833 and ‘reached its zenith
about mid-century’ (1959: 195). It has been observed that the average size
of a combined business was far larger than the existing size of either a
spinning firm or weaving establishment. The increased scale of the combined business establishment is evident when we examine employment
statistics derived from this time. Factory inspectorate statistics, in 1841,
identified 548 spinning firms to have employed an average of 125 full-time
employees (quoted in Smelser 1959: 195). According to the factory
inspectorate, 89 power-weave firms engaged an average of 100 operatives.
Conversely, the 313 firms which had combined both spinning and
weaving employed an average of 350 employees per firm. The size of
combined firms was even greater in the cities. Manchester and Aston had
65 combined spinning and weaving firms, employing an average of 500
operatives (1959: 195).
Such increases in the scale of production contrasted markedly with the
family economies of the domestic system. During the proto-industry phase
of textile production ‘the spinning wheel and the loom required no larger
apartment than that of a cottage’ (Pike 1966: 33). Conversely, the series of
machine innovations which had revolutionized production ‘required both
more space than could be found in a cottage and more power than could
be applied by the human arm’ (1966: 33). The scope and size of steam


-----

driven operations necessitated the design of a new form of business
premises. Factories rose to meet this challenge. But as factories multiplied
in the towns and cities ‘they called into being a new class of human society’
(1966: 43). Mechanization and steam power had consumed virtually every
stage of the production process, and workers were increasingly becoming
‘machine minders rather than machine operatives’ (Chapman 1987: 17).
To this extent, mechanization constituted the steady progression toward
‘depersonalization and anonymity’ (Smelser 1959: 195).

Gender and time work discipline

The conditions of life and labour, in the new factory towns of the textile
industry, were often hazardous and bleak. Early investors in cotton
manufacture tended to be entrepreneurs with limited capital, who were to
invest the entirety of their capital reserves into machinery. Each new
advance in machine technology simplified the process of manufacture and
speeded up the rate of output, thus multiplying the opportunities for the
accumulation of wealth (Bryant 1971: 57). Machinery gave the speculative
investor a chance for quick riches. All that was needed was for the
entrepreneur to hire or buy sufficient power looms to fill a room and ‘a
resolve to keep his expenses and consequently his prices down against all
rivals and a plentiful supply of cheap labour’ (1971: 58). Absorbed by the
intention to maximize immediate returns on their capital, these investors
too easily neglected the employment needs of the workforce, consequently, working conditions were often abominable. The size of the early
factories was invariably incapacious. Production rooms had low ceilings,
which were contracted in dimensions. Windows were purposely narrow so
as to maximize space ‘and very little precaution was used, either as to
ventilation or temperature’ (Gaskell 1836: 138). The lack of ventilation was
even more disgraceful in the carding room, where the air was heavily laden
with fluff which exposed operatives to the likelihood of eventually
developing lung disease. The quality of air was further inhibited by the
burning of tallow candles, made from a fatty substance, which produced a
foul heavy smoke when ignited. There were many social commentators
who were appalled by the dire health conditions of factory buildings.
Even more disconcerting was the harsh forms of time-discipline
administered by the ‘frugal-minded overseers’ (Bryant 1971: 56). In 1844,
James Leach, a prominent member of the Chartist Movement, published
factual evidence of the sparse conditions and coercive time-discipline
regime imposed in the factory system. The following extract provides a
particularly relevant account of gender, time and working conditions:

A great number of the females employed in factories are married, and
not a small number of them are mothers. It frequently happens that
the husband is refused work in the same mill with the wife; under


-----

these circumstances the poor creature is obliged to leave her husband
in bed at five o’clock in the morning, while she hurries off to the mill
to undergo her daily repetition of drudgery, in order to procure a
scanty portion of food for her husband, herself, and her helpless
children. We have repeatedly seen a married female, in the last stage
of pregnancy, slaving from morning till night beside these never-tiring
machines, and when oppressed nature became so exhausted that they
were obliged to sit down to take a moment’s ease, and being seen by
the manager, were fined sixpence for the offence. In some mills, the
crime of sitting down to take a little rest is visited with a penalty of one
shilling, but let the masters and their rules speak for themselves.

‘1st. The door of the lodge will be closed ten minutes after the engine
starts every morning, and no weaver will afterwards be admitted till
breakfast-time. Any weaver who may be absent during that time shall
forfeit threepence per loom . . .’

It often happens that when the weaver goes to work in the morning,
he finds the clock fifteen minutes forwarder than when he left in the
evening. The hands on the factory clock do not always move from the
internal wheels, but very frequently from a little external aid: this always
takes place after the hands have left the mill in the evening . . .

At this mill, a short time ago, one of the cut-lookers was discharged,
and another placed in his situation. When he had been there a fortnight, the master asked him ‘‘How it was that he had so little in his
bate book;’’ the man replied, ‘‘I think there’s a great deal, I ‘bate the
weavers so much that I can’t for shame look them in the face when I
meet them in the street’’. The master answered, ‘‘You be d—d, you
are five pounds a week worse to me than the man that had this
situation before you, and I’ll kick you out of the place’’. The man was
discharged to make room for another who knew his duty better’.

Early forms of capitalist expropriation entailed a strategy of absolute surplus
value extraction, which demanded extended working hours at reduced
rates of pay. In this situation socially necessary labour time contained
within the working day remains constant, while surplus labour time is
significantly increased. Absolute surplus value also has a direct bearing on
the technologies of production, as it attempts to yield an increased magnitude of output, while retaining the rate of variable capital inputs to a level
which does not threaten the rate of surplus value. Broadly speaking,
absolute surplus value is defined technically ‘as any increase in the sum of
surplus labour-time worked, regardless of the form that this takes, and
without any alteration of the rate of variable capital that is required to


-----

52 Gender and work in capitalist economies

generate that surplus labour time’ (Lee 1993: 121). It is generally recognized that factory employees experienced long hours of work, in overcrowded mills with limited leisure time. Gaskell noted that protracted
working hours was a defining feature of factory production in the early
eighteenth century:

The time of labour was extended to twelve hours, with very little
interval; the immense profits which accrued from their produce
pushing aside all ulterior considerations. Nor was this all: unsatisfied
with the day labour, the night was almost uniformly spent by one
portion of the hands in the mill; the owners or occupiers thus securing
twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four for making their
machinery valuable.
(Gaskell 1836: 138)

Such arduous conditions were exacerbated by the objectionable behaviour
of overbearing foremen. As can often be the case with the servant turned
master, ‘they tended to confuse discipline with terror’ (Bryant 1971: 56).
Foremen had little reason to adopt a more amiable approach to shop floor
management, as disgruntled employees could be easily replaced with
abundant supplies of cheap labourers. And the capitalist was merely concerned with paying as little for labour as possible, while also maximizing
the work output of every hour of production. It is unsurprising that the
factory system earned the notorious accolade ‘Dark Satanic Mills’ (Blake

[1804] 1991).
From the early days of the factory system it was clearly apparent that the
conditions of factory life were appalling and yet industrialists appeared
oblivious to these concerns. Part of the problem was the untrammelled
power of the capitalist ‘whose responsibility was confined to the payment
of wages for work done and nothing else’ (Addy 1976: 33). Capitalist
avarice was corroborated by utilitarian social policies which promoted ‘the
greatest happiness for the greatest number’. The theory that the ‘State
could only delay and perhaps defeat the beneficent purposes of Providence’
was expounded by Jeremy Bentham (Bryant 1971: 54). This philosophical
treatise provided an excuse for the suffering and inhumanity of the factory
system, for it was interpreted as meaning that ‘employers and employed
must be left free to make whatever bargains they chose’ (1971: 55). And so
it was deemed commercially legitimate to rely upon women, children, the
poor and unemployed, as a source of cheap labour. Indeed, in the early
stages of industrialization, low cost female and child labour ‘substituted for
technological improvements in the factories’ (Valenze 1995: 93). While
this is an often stated fact, feminist analyses of salary scales in the factory
system suggest that the complex dynamics of time and gender patterned
insidious levels of inequality.

Wage differentials: timely constructions or a source of lower
human capital and productivity levels?

Transformations in the organization of textile work helped to identify
female labourers as a specific aggregation of the industrial working class
(Honeyman 2000: 54). The rapid economic development of the factory
system had ‘eclipsed the smaller paternalistic factories of the rural villages’
(Valenze 1995: 93). According to Anna Clark, these paternalistic factories
relied upon a family labour system in which ‘the subordinate labour of
women and children was necessary and accepted; buttressing rather than
undermining patriarchal authority’ (Honeyman 2000: 55). The factory
system traded upon this inequality in the gender division of labour, and
even exploited it as a basis for unequal rates of pay. Evidence confirms that
even from the early emergence of the factory system, women were not
offered a ‘living wage’ and that this was based on the assumption that a
woman would be dependent on a male as a source of financial support. But
as industrial cotton manufacturing expanded, it became obvious that the
factory system offered limited opportunities for adult males to earn a
‘family wage’ (Rose 1996: 149). Consequently, the family unit relied upon
the independent earnings of individual members of the household.
Although the factory system provided women with the opportunity to
become ‘independent wage earners’, it cemented rather than undermined
the financial dependency of women. For, women were invariably paid less
than their male counterparts. According to Burnette (1997: 257), it is
recognized that during the Industrial Revolution ‘the female-male wage
ratio generally varied from one-third to two-thirds, depending on the type
of work and the location’. Valenze (1995: 90) provides evidence derived
from the Factory Commission report of 1833, identifying ‘women earning
an average of 9s. 8¼d. per week, compared with 22s. 8½ d. for men’. Table
2.1 contains official statistical evidence charting the average weekly wage
of flax mill workers in Scotland, in 1833. Table 2.2 contains official statistical evidence charting the average weekly wage of flax mill workers in
Leeds, in 1833.
Honeyman (2000) details how factory owners often imposed differentials in the payment structure of female textile workers. Males tended to
be paid a weekly rate; conversely female workers were paid by the unit of
output and received significantly less wages than their male counterparts.
This marked difference in the wages received by male and female textile
workers has provoked significant debate among economists and feminist
historians. While it is agreed that the salaries of female textile workers were
a fraction of that received by males, some disagreement exists as to the basis
of this distinction. According to neoclassical economic theory, wages
reflect the productive capacities of labour (Becker 1971). Consequently a
neoclassical economist would interpret wage disparities as evidence of
differences in levels of productivity. Similar conclusions have been presented by Joyce Burnette (1997) in her Investigation of the Female-Male Wage

Gap during the Industrial Revolution. Burnette cites Becker’s (1971) The
Economics of Discrimination as a basis for an alternative application of neoclassical economic theory. According to Burnette’s reading of Becker,
‘wage discrimination is more compatible with monopolistic markets than
with competitive markets’ (1997: 261). It is assumed that in a competitive
market, ‘firms that do not discriminate have lower costs and tend to expand
at the expense of discriminating firms’ (1997: 261). Burnette alleges that
this is because wage discrimination can persist in uncompetitive markets
where labourers are limited in their employment choices. Burnette presents
historical data to this effect and claims that: ‘women workers in more
competitive industries such as agriculture and most cottage industries
received market wages based on their marginal productivity, not simply a
customary ‘‘women’s wage’’ ’ (1997: 261).
Burnette’s position here is in contrast with cultural evidence which
convincingly suggests that the female-male wage gap was a product of:

early trade union activity, the ideology of the family wage, employers’
adherence to traditional norms of what was suitable work for women,
increased tensions between motherhood and economic activity, and
the implications of developing areas of respectability for sex segregation at work.
(Humphries 1991, quoted in Burnette 1997: 257)

Humphries emphasizes the significance of cultural values as a determinant
of the female-male wage gap during the Industrial Revolution. Similar
conclusions are presented by Berg (1993) and Jordan (1989). While
‘women may also have faced discrimination before entering the labour
market’ and ‘women’s wages were discriminatory in certain parts of the
labour market’, Burnette claims that ‘the majority of women workers were
paid market wages’ (1997: 262). Burnette’s observations are of particular
interest because of the distinction she makes between ‘piece rate’ and ‘time
rate’ as a basis of wages. She claims that the majority of the suppositions
made about inequality in the salaries of male and female factory workers is
based on an inaccurate understanding of both types of wages. Time rate is a
system by which the labourer is paid according to the amount of time
worked. In the modern era time rates are standardized agreements based on
a stable consistent timetable. Conversely, in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, time rate wages were quoted on a daily or weekly basis. This
system contrasted with piece rate wages which were based on the worker’s
unit of output. Some illustration of this distinction is provided in the
following extract from Gaskell:

It may be supposed that the masters, in thus wishing to rid themselves
of a turbulent set of workmen, were influenced by other causes – that
women and children could be made to work a cheap rate, and thus
add to his profits. This has had considerable weight doubtless. The
mode of payment now universally adopted by the trade, which is


-----

56 Gender and work in capitalist economies

payment for work done, piece work as it is called, – the spinner for
the number of pounds of yard he produces, the weaver for the
number of cuts of yards turned off from his loom, – places the active
girl upon a par with the most robust adult.
(Gaskell 1836: 146)

According to Burnette, in occupations based on piece rate, salary differentials often highlighted as evidence of sex discrimination ‘are really
average weekly earnings on piece rates (i.e., the average, or usual, amount
that a woman doing the work would earn in a week)’ (1997: 263).
Burnette argues that women’s domestic responsibilities within the home
often meant that they had less time to dedicate to market work compared
with the average man. Evidence from the Handloom Weavers Commission (1840) provides some support for this claim. In 1840, it found that
women handloom weavers working in weave shops earned an average of
5s. 5d a week, while females in the same profession working at home
earned an average of 4s per week (quoted in Burnette 1997: 263). The
commission claimed that the lower salary earned by the female home
worker was because ‘their time is partly occupied by their domestic duties’
(quoted in Burnette 1997: 263). Similar conclusions were included in
Parliamentary Papers in 1816. The following is an extract of testimony
provided by a cotton manufacturer called Henry Houdsworth:

Do you employ many women in picking cotton? – I do.
Does that employment necessarily oblige them to be constant in their
attendance? – No; the doors are open during the summer the same
hours that the mill works in the summer time, when it is light; but in
the winter they never work by candle-light; and as they are a very
irregular set of hands, time is not noticed.
(Parliamentary Paper 1816: 233)

For Burnette, this statement would provide evidence to support her claim
that ‘in most cases of piece rate work the female-male wage gap is purely
the result of differences in output rather than of differences in the piece
rate’ (1997: 265). Elsewhere Burnette provides statistical tables demonstrating that women earned lower time rate wages than men. This disparity
is also explained in relation to ‘differences in the number of hours worked
. . . because women generally worked fewer hours per day’ (1997: 268).
Thus, in summary, Burnette claims that much of the disparities in the
wages between male and females, during the Industrial Revolution, were
due to the fact ‘women were less productive than men’ (1997: 272).
Burnette is keen to attribute any remaining disparities in male and female
wages to ‘differences in human capital’ (1997: 272). Women were often
denied access to the skill and experience, which would enable them to
compete with their male counterparts. Burnette alleges that women were
further disadvantaged in the labour market by childbearing, which ‘affected
women’s productivity mainly through discouraging investment in human

capital’ (1997: 274). Such conclusions collaborate with conservative discourse, which assumes that disparities in the wages of men and women
during the Industrial Revolution were a consequence of market factors
(Honeyman 2000: 55). What is lost in such perspectives is an engagement
with the dynamics of power and an analysis of the systematic discrimination of female workers. These conceptual limitations are less evident in
feminist historical analysis, which have focused on the interplay of patriarchy and capitalism.

From private to public patriarchy

[T]hat factory females have in general much lower wages than males,
and they have been pitied on this account with perhaps an injudicious
sympathy, since the low price of their labour here tends to make
household duties their most profitable as well as agreeable occupation,
and prevents them from being tempted by the mill to abandon the
care of their offspring at home. Thus Providence effects its purposes
with a wisdom and efficacy which should repress the short-sighted
presumption of human devices.
(Dr. Ure, quoted in Gaskell 1836: 174)

It is undoubtedly true that the celebrated story of the factory’s beginnings
has tended to obscure the role that patriarchy and male-dominated trade
unions played in the creation of a gender-segregated workforce. Men
organized to create trade unions which systematically excluded women
from a variety of skilled occupations (Busfield 1988: 161). Their resilience
was in part based on a perceived need to defend themselves from cheap
female labour (Honeyman 2000). The rapid pace of technological innovation had introduced faster machines capable of simplifying complex
operations and these developments favoured the employment of cheap
unskilled female labour.
Typically male trade unionists resolved to exclude women ‘according to
practices protected by tradition’ (Valenze 1995: 95). In the nineteenth
century, male cotton spinners organized to prevent women from operating
the spinning mules. Such intention was achieved by the action of the
Grand General Union of Spinners, which was formed in 1829 (Davies
1975). The Spinners Union was an exclusively male organization and at its
inauguration adopted a resolution that ‘no person or persons be learned or
allowed to spin except the son, brother or orphan nephew of spinners and
the poor relations of the proprietors of the mills’ (Busfield 1988: 161). In so
doing male spinners were able to restructure the meaning of craft status to
encompass training, machine maintenance and quality controls (Honeyman 2000: 60). Skilled status was thus secured through the ‘construction of
an artificial monopoly’, which strictly controlled entry to the trade.
Females were therefore excluded from the central vehicle for gaining


-----

58 Gender and work in capitalist economies

training and skill, the apprenticeship (Busfield 1988). While there is limited
information regarding girls and craft apprenticeships, it would appear that
from the mid-fifteenth century onwards ‘women were gradually excluded
from the male-dominated guilds’ (1988: 160). Although it is possible that
some women might have received limited training from their fathers, on
the whole, their expertise was insufficient to provide anything more than
assistance. Alexander also identifies craft guilds as having systematically
excluded women except ‘for the wives and widows of master craftsmen’
(Alexander 1989: 39). By the eighteenth century, the policy of exclusion,
linked with the handcraft base of manufacture, provided skilled workmen
with some degree of control over the labour process (1989: 39). Men
organized to secure craft status by ensuring that entry to trade societies was
restricted and knowledge of skills was protected by apprenticeships. Barriers to entry enabled craft unions to maintain a position of strength relative
to unskilled workmen. Prohibited from claiming professional accreditation,
unskilled workers lacked vital bargaining power against capital. The ability
of craft-based trade unions to secure prestige and power by restricting
access to apprenticeships, was particularly detrimental for women. While
women and men shared in the expansion of industrialization, women had
historically been ‘denied access to socially recognized skills’ and thus were
restricted in the jobs they could perform (1989: 39). Thus, although more
and more women entered the industrial economy, they did so without the
trade union protection enjoyed by their male counterparts.
In due course, employment protection began to emerge. But the pace of
factory reform was no doubt hindered by the contradictions of utilitarian
social policy and the activities of male unionists. Indeed, it has been argued
that the influx of female labourers into the industrial economy had
‘destabilized the balance of capital and patriarchal interests’ (Holloway
2005: 28). These tensions were compounded by pressures from commercial interests to continue existing patterns of sex discrimination in the
allocation of wages. Gender inequality provided a lucrative means of both
limiting the amounts paid to female workers and depressing the wage scales
of male workers, as is evident in the following extract derived from a
parliamentary paper published in 1892:

The employment of women tells very much against the men.
Employers feel that men’s work is not worth above 6d or 1s at the
outside per piece more than that of women, and use the cheapness of
the latter to depress the price of the former. They have often told men
who apply for work that they will employ them only if they will
accept women’s wages. And in some cases, unfortunately, the men
have agreed to these terms. If both were to be paid at the same rate,
men would probably have the preference for employment, but it is to
be feared that this uniformity will be attained not by raising the wages
of the women, but by reducing those of men. There are scores of
able-bodied, competent men who are unable to obtain employment

in consequence of the competition of women. The result is that
mothers are obliged to go to the mills, neglecting their hired nurses,
while the fathers are idle. Several firms, however, recognize the evil of
this state of things, and have ceased to employ married women.
(Parliamentary Papers (1892: 227)

The campaign for factory reform produced a barrage of opposition from
commercial interests keen to halt factory reform on the grounds that
legislative regulation would hinder the nation’s economic power (Bryant
1971: 55). At the same time, male unionists were vigorously campaigning
against the low cost competition represented by the influx of women and
children into the labour market. Many unions sought an answer in the
promotion of ‘protective labour laws for women and children’ (Hartmann
1981: 21). The resultant Factory Acts had the dual effect of ameliorating
some of the more rapacious conditions of long working hours, but they
also excluded women from many ‘male’ jobs. The first major Factory Act,
passed in 1833, made it illegal to employ children under the age of 9 and
regulated hours of work. The Act of 1833 was passed through Parliament,
partly to circumvent the demands of Ashley and others lobbying for a TenHour Bill restricting the working hours of adults (Thompson 1967: 47).
But this was a temporary reprieve. The 1844 Factory Act extended
restrictions on the hours worked to women, and in 1847 reduced these
hours to ten (Holloway 2005: 29). Throughout the century a flurry of
factory reforms systematically limited the number of hours women could
work. Cultural historians have often referred to the campaign for factory
reform, as illustrating the humanitarian convictions of prominent middleclass agitators incensed by the terrible conditions of factory work (Bryant
1971).
Feminist historians have challenged the degree to which factory reforms
represented benign and progressive sentimentalities. The motivation of
successive reforms, restricting the hours women worked, partly stemmed
from a paternalistic philanthropy intent on extending ‘the ideal bourgeois
family structure to the working class’ (Holloway 2005: 28). The vast army
of women employed in industry presented a direct challenge to the
domesticated image of women evident in cultural discourse. Working
women were thought to be abandoning their appropriate gender roles and
this threatened to destabilize the family. Evidence of this concern is provided in the following extract of a parliamentary paper published in 1833:

But one of the greatest evils to the working man is the ignorance of
the women of his own class, who are generally incapable of becoming
either good wives or good mothers . . . Brought up in the factory until
they are married, and sometimes working there long after that event
has taken place, even when they have become mothers, they are
almost entirely ignorant of household duties, and are incapable of
laying out the money their husbands have earned to the best
advantage. They are equally incapable of preparing his victuals, in an


-----

economical and comfortable manner; and it not infrequently happens
that as much money is spent on a Sunday’s dinner as in other and
better hands would have procured a dinner for two or three days. A
working man is fortunate, indeed, who happens to marry a young
woman that has been brought up in service, and whose habits of
cleanliness and knowledge of household duties secure him a comfortable home and economical management.

The practice of the working men in general is to entrust the laying
out of their money to their wives, and hence a knowledge of
household duties, combined with habits of industry, cleanliness and
economy, is of first-rate importance amongst the females of this class
of society to working men. In thousands of instances the very contrary
of these desirable virtues prevails, and the industrious working man
lives in misery and debt from the conduct of an ignorant gin-drinking
woman called his wife. Every apology, however, may be offered for
some of these unfortunate creatures, for they have never had the
opportunity of learning better; and a most happy thing it would be for
thousands, if, when the hours of labour are shortened for children, a
provision were made for teaching the females sewing, knitting, . . .
and in some measure initiating them into the duties they may one day
be called upon to perform as wives and mothers. The present
ignorance of the women brought up in our manufactories is productive of an incalculable amount of poverty and wretchedness, and
tends to perpetuate depravity of character as much, as, if not more
than, any other circumstance.
(Parliamentary Papers 1833: 1117)

Marxist feminist historians, interpret concerns raised about factory work
and the demise of traditional female roles as demonstrating fundamental
interconnections between patriarchy and capitalism. According to Barratt
and McIntosh (1989), the introduction of women and children into the
factory system was a strategic move by capitalists to deskill the labour
process and maximize profits by extending the working day. By the 1830s,
it became apparent that a strategy of absolute surplus value extraction was
‘incompatible’ with the reproduction of a fit and healthy working class.
Consequently it became imperative, from the point of view of both the
capitalist and labourer, ‘to protect the life and health of the industrial
proletariat’ (1989: 73).
According to Barratt and McIntosh, pressure from the trade unions and
social reformers coincided with capitalism’s self-interested intention to
stem the degeneration of the family. It certainly seems the case that factory
employment became a power struggle between patriarchal and capitalist
forces, and the resultant factory reforms were clearly designed to restrict the
hours worked by female employees. It is also evident that these reforms
represented a mutually beneficial compromise between patriarchal and
capitalist interests. This is particularly evident with regards to the


-----

establishment of the ‘family wage’. The trade union movement used the
restricted working hours, legislated by the Factory Acts, as a lever to reduce
their working hours. Losses incurred by working fewer hours were circumvented by the claim that a male worker should be considered a
‘breadwinner’, and provided with wages sufficient to support a dependent
wife and children. The capitalist state responded favourably to this claim as
it preserved the idealized patriarchal family structure and also enhanced the
profit margins of factory owners. Needless to say, the accumulative effect
of the ‘breadwinner’ lobby was to further reduce the pitiful wage paid to
female labourers. Sex discrimination in the levels of pay received by
women could now be ‘justified on the grounds that they were supported,
at least partially by a husband or father’ (Busfield 1988: 162). Within such a
deleterious context, many women had little choice but to occupy low paid
employment, requiring little technical training and providing limited job
security. It is clear, therefore, that from the onset of the textile revolution
female labour constituted ‘the industrial reserve army’, which was at once
both a precondition and necessary product of the time-disciplined accumulation of capital (Alexander 1989: 39).

Conclusion

During the eighteenth century the expansion of commercial trade, through
the acquisition of markets abroad, constituted ‘the economic conditions for
the hierarchy of labour powers’ in textile production (Alexander 1989: 40).
It is conventionally recognized that market pressures, which exceeded the
capacities of pre-industrial production, precipitated the revolution in
textile production. Merchant capitalists found the wide geographical dispersal of pre-industrial production units prohibitively expensive. The costs
involved in distributing raw materials to home-based producers were
further compounded by the logistic difficulties involved in regulating
standard levels of quality (Honeyman 2000: 35). In these circumstances, the
process of outwork became devalued and ‘production for exchange’ was
increasingly transferred away from the homestead into factories and
workshops (Alexander 1989: 40). Eventually this concentration of capital
facilitated the development of more advanced machines, which further
undermined the domestic system of putting-out carried out in the
homestead. Domestic production struggled to compete with the organizational logistics and economic rationality of large-scale production. The
technological challenge presented by mechanical production was selfevidently superior. And economies of scale made it inevitable that
manufacturing would transfer to the factory system of production.
Moreover, the technological innovations of the factory system provided
capital with the ability to centralize their operations and exert greater
control over the labour process. It was supposed that women were more
inclined to docile servitude and thus likely to comply with the time

disciplined regime of factory production. Indeed, Gaskell advanced the
belief that mechanization was resonant with the ‘disposition’ of women
(1836: 143). While it is evidently true that female workers lacked bargaining power, it is necessary to recognize the interplay of gender, time
and political economy in determining the arduous social history of the
female textile worker.

Engendering Marx’s economic categories

Historical analysis of textile production, in the nineteenth century, highlights the part played by time-discipline in the accumulation of capital
through the expropriation of the workers’ surplus production. Marx
argued that the value of a commodity is determined by ‘the quantity of the
value-creating substance, the labour, contained in the article’ (Capital, Vol.
1 [1887] 2003: 46). Marx further argued that ‘the quantity of labour . . . is
measured by its duration and labour time in its turn finds its standard in
weeks, days and hours’ (2003: 46). Thus, the value of a commodity is
determined by the magnitude of labour time required in its production.
And the expropriation of surplus labour time forms the basis of capitalist
accumulation. Such conclusions have resonance with the pattern of
industrial advancement, which pronounced the British textile revolution.
The evolution of textile machinery at first subjected the labour process to
an immoderate extension in the duration of the working day. This creates,
on the one hand, new circumstances by which capital can sustain the
metronomic rhythms of factory production and, on the other, ‘new
motives with which to whet capital’s appetite for the labour of others’
(2003: 380). In Chapter 1 it was argued that a new economy of time,
precipitated by extensive accumulation, was the fundamental driving force
in capitalism’s mass recruitment of women into the factory system. The
excessive extension of the working day necessitated the ‘opening out to the
capitalist new strata of working-class’ (2003: 384). And it was from the
ranks of dispossessed female handspinners that capitalism recruited its
reservoir of unskilled workers.
Marx’s concept of relative surplus value provides a means of explaining
why, throughout the nineteenth century, controls over the working


-----

64 Gender and work in capitalist economies

conditions of women succeeded in regulating their hours of work. The
first generation of textile machines demanded a habituation into
mechanistic rhythms which were ‘repeated day after day with unvarying
uniformity’ (2003: 386). The capacity of humans to apprehend the
metronomic rhythms of machinery inevitably produces limitations and
thus the ‘lengthening of the working day becomes compatible only with a
lower degree of intensity’ (2003: 386). In the history of capitalism, profit
acts as a spur to technical innovation; and technical change is at the heart of
the historical dialectic which distinguishes extensive and intensive accumulation. The latter ‘consists in raising the productive power of the
workman, so as to enable him to produce more in a given time with the
same expenditure of labour’ (2003: 386). In this respect, technological
innovation is directed towards maximizing profit through the minimization of paid labour time. This criterion informed the development of
textile machinery towards the ‘condensation of labour to a degree that is
attainable only within the limits of the shortened working day’ (2003: 486).
Chapter 2 argues that it was within this intensive economy of time that
female labour time became an object of regulation.
Marx’s economic categories clearly have relevance to explaining the
political economy of time, which transformed textile production in the
nineteenth century. But in orthodox Marxist theory, the analysis of labour
time is relevant only in so far as it has direct relation to capital and the
making of profit. Consequently, the accumulation of profits is assumed, by
orthodox Marxists, to systematically transform ‘social structure as it transforms the relations of production’ (Hartmann 1981: 10). The family and
domestic labour expended in the reproduction of the working class are
merely discerned as ‘by-products of the accumulation process itself’ (1981:
10). As a feature of the superstructure, domestic labour is, by default,
merely functional to and determined by capitalism (Williams 1988: 40).
Consequently, Marx’s focus on the capitalist–proletariat relationship provides little space for an analysis of how domestic labour time relates to
capital.
In the 1960s and 1970s, left-wing feminists became increasingly vocal
about the gender myopia of orthodox Marxist theory. But while united in
their commitment to challenge Marx’s gender-blind categories, feminists
differed markedly in their explanations for the nature of domestic labour.
Indeed, a vociferous debate has arisen, which is geared towards determining the origin of women’s oppression in terms of the ‘productivity’ of
domestic labour. These feminist authors have assumed one of two positions. The first school of thought is categorical in its claim that domestic
labour is actually productive labour. Of particular concern is the tendency
for orthodox Marxists to treat ‘women’s production of use-values’ as
‘outside the exchange of labour for wages even though economically part
of the creation of surplus value’ (Williams 1988: 46). One of the earliest
Marxist feminists to make this claim was Margaret Benston in 1969 and,
she was one of the first to equate domestic labour with the production of


-----

Economies of time and gender 65

‘use-values’. Key additional contributors to this school of thought include
Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James (1975). They are renowned for
claiming that domestic labour produces use-values and is, therefore, a
source of surplus value. Dalla Costa and James’s interpretation of Marx’s
labour theory of value generated much feminist debate during the 1970s.
This feminist perspective provides important insights when examining
gender, domestic labour time and political economy. Nevertheless, feminist analysis is clearly mistaken in its endeavour to force domestic labour
time into Marx’s economic categories. Such conclusions are presented by a
second school of thought which argues that domestic labour is unproductive labour (Seccombe 1974; Harris 1983). This chapter critically
examines these feminist contributions. The chapter argues that both
feminist traditions constitute domestic labour time as Other to the economic times of the productive economy. An alternative position is to
develop the tendency, as Rosa Luxemburg (1971) observed, for capitalist
expansion to, on the one hand, depend on the preservation of noneconomic strata and, on the other, to ravenously erode these areas as part of
capital accumulation. Similar dynamics are evident, in the organization of
domestic labour time, as a non-capitalist reservoir of supply for capital’s
means of production. It is my contention that the existence and development of industrial capitalism are predicated on the expropriation of
domestic labour time as a non-economic resource.

The family and domestic labour time in historical context

Although Marx’s own analysis is seemingly bereft of explanations for
gender inequality within the family, subsequent Marxist analysis has
directly considered the economic aspects of domestic labour. Friedrich
Engels ([1884] 1985) argued that gender inequality in the domestic division
of labour has trajectories in economic and material conditions. Indeed, the
history of the family traces ‘the victory of private property over primitive,
natural communal property’ (1985: 95). Consequently domestic labour has
a definitive relation to capital. For it operates to ‘maintain and reproduce
the labour force and therefore the Capitalist Mode of Production’ (Williams 1988: 42). But this could only be consistent with the view that
‘capital and private property’ was the primary cause of women’s oppression
in capitalist society (Hartmann 1981: 5). Engels repeatedly defends this
assumption, most especially in his claim that women’s participation in the
public sphere of paid labour will unbridle the control men possess over
women within the family. Engels optimistically claimed that women’s mass
participation in the labour force would irrevocably undermine patriarchal
relations, thus pre-empting the eventual destruction of gender inequality.
To facilitate female employment, ‘private housekeeping’ needed to be
‘transformed into a social industry’ (1985: 107). This would disrupt capitalism’s reliance on women to sustain labour power through their provision


-----

66 Gender and work in capitalist economies

of domestic labour. Engels further argued that with the ‘transfer of the
means of production into common ownership’ the patriarchal anxieties
around ‘bequeathing and inheriting’ would dissipate (1985: 106–7). Thus,
‘the single family ceases to be the economic unit of society’ and domestic
labour time is no longer a burden for the individual female, but part of the
social production of domestic labour. As much as Engels has been commended for identifying domestic labour as inextricably tied to formal
economic production, his analysis also ‘failed to focus on the differences
between men’s and women’s experiences under capitalism’ (Hartmann
1981: 5). While clearly recognizing domestic labour as a site for the
reproduction of labour power, Engels neglected to address the feminist
issues of ‘how and why women are oppressed as women’ (1981: 5). Engels
predicted that women’s mass participation into the labour force will
undermine patriarchy. But ‘patriarchal relations, far from being atavistic
leftovers’ (1981: 5) are accrescent in their ability to prosper alongside
capitalist modes of production.
Feminists working within the tradition of historical materialism have
been assiduous in their endeavours to challenge the assumption that Marx’s
categories can only be determined by the capitalist–proletarian relationship.
For many, the central challenge has been Marx’s distinction between
‘productive’ and ‘unproductive’ labour. Productive labour involves the
direct exchange of labour time for capital or revenue thus, ‘the labourprocess is a process between things that the capitalist has purchased’ (Marx,
Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 180). Conversely, Marx defines unproductive
labour as ‘paid out of revenue’ and involving labour bought from the
capitalist or workers for ‘personal consumption’ (Williams 1988: 44). For
Marxist feminists, the issue of contention here is to what extent it can be
argued that domestic labour is ‘unproductive labour and therefore outside
market production’ (1988: 46). Orthodox Marxist theory highlights the
rise of commodity production as a central precursor in determining
domestic labour’s status as unproductive labour. Pre-industrial patterns of
work had emphasized an ‘essential conditioning in different notations of
time provided by different work-situations and their relation to ‘‘natural’’
rhythms’ (Thompson 1967: 59).
Pre-industrial agricultural work involved a perpetual sequence of
activities of varying durations defined by the qualitative cycles of the
seasons. Conversely, time measurement in industrial capitalism is defined
not by the task but by the value of time when reduced to money. Time
becomes an economic measure of productivity and this transformation
impacts on the spatial location of work. In pre-industrial society there was
limited specialist segregation of work from other aspects of everyday life.
The fluidity of the boundaries between work and everyday life was supported by the forms of cottage industry which existed alongside agriculture
as pre-industrial forms of production (Clarke and Critcher 1990).
As commodities began to be produced for accumulation and profit,
there emerged a need to synchronize the performance of work and separate

it from the homestead; ‘the place in which family or household matters
were practiced’ (Firat 1994: 207). The attributes of work performed in
each sphere were deemed to be both quantitatively and qualitatively different. To the public domain was designated the production of goods and
services designed for commodity markets. This became the sphere of
‘value-producing’ activities (1994: 207). Conversely, the homestead was
the domain of recreation and consumption. Thus, the private sphere is
deemed vital for the reproduction of labour power. This segregation of the
labour process into private and public spheres produced a split in the labour
force along sexual contours. Those people who mostly inhabit the public
sphere of industry and commerce are commonly males, while females tend
to be located in the private sphere of domestic activities. According to
orthodox Marxism, the public sphere is the ‘unit of capitalist production’
and the private sphere is the ‘unit of reproduction for capital’ (Seccombe
1974: 6). It is in the public sphere that labour time ‘enters directly into the
development of productive forces’ (1974: 6). Therefore orthodox Marxists
argue that it is only the productivity of labour time in the public domain
that is of interest to capital. Conversely, the development of privatized
domestic labour removed from the direct exchange of labour time for
capital means that ‘the law of value does not govern domestic labour’
(1974: 6). This is clearly the economic thinking of both Marx and Engels,
thus explaining why the legacy of orthodox Marxism contains ‘economic
categories’, which appear ‘only relevant to the position of the proletariat at
the point of production and . . . the position of women in the home . . . [is]
somehow outside their scope’ (Foreman 1978: 112).

Domestic labour time as productive labour time?

According to Marx, the value of a commodity derives from ‘the labour
time necessary for its production’ (Marx, Capital. Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 62)
and surplus labour time produces profit, which is converted into monetary
value by the capitalist during the circulation of products on the market.
Viewing productive labour in this way has tended to exclude domestic
labour from orthodox Marxist accounts of capitalist accumulation.
Orthodox Marxists claim that domestic labour is unsalaried labour and
therefore ‘not part of the official economy’ (Seccombe 1974: 4). Thus, on
examining Marx’s definition of value, it becomes clear why the role of the
woman ‘in the cycle of production remained invisible’, this is because ‘only
the product of her labour, the labourer was visible’ (Dalla Costa and James
1975: 26).
To the extent that orthodox Marxism defines capitalist relations of
power entirely in terms of the capitalist–proletarian relationship, it fails to
recognize that it is ‘precisely through the wage [that] the exploitation of the
non-wage labourer [has] been organized’ (Dalla Costa and James 1975: 26).
Marxist feminists have been keen to identify domestic labour as a manifestation of capitalism. Deriving from this consensus has emerged a school


-----

68 Gender and work in capitalist economies

of feminist thought intent on highlighting how domestic labour both
produces labour power and contributes to its value. Defined as the
‘Domestic Labour as Productive Labour School’ (DLPLS), this tradition of
materialist feminism seeks to engender Marx’s economic categories (Williams 1988: 44). We have already recognized that axiomatic to Marx’s
concept of value is the distinction between ‘useful’ and ‘abstract’ labour
(Meek 1979). Against these categories is situated domestic labour. Conversely, DLPLS identifies domestic labour as ‘a supplier of a series of usevalues in the home’ (Dalla Costa and James 1975: 31). This contention was
originally voiced by Margaret Benston in 1969. Benston observes that the
structure of the nuclear family is such that ‘it is an ideal consumption unit’
(1989: 38). This notion of the family is consistently reproduced in classical
economic theory, where the housewife’s primary role is constituted as a
mere consumer of the patriarch’s salaried wage. Alternatively, Benston
(1989) argues that domestic labour is actually a producer of use-values
which are consumed within the household. This supposition arises from a
corresponding analysis of commodity production in capitalist society.
Drawing upon the earlier work of Ernest Mandel (1967), Benston argues
that in capitalist society, commodity production overshadows all other
forms of production.
The rise of commodity production and its subsequent regularization has
radically transformed the labour process and the organization of society.
Nevertheless, while commodity production is a ‘major part of production’,
it is not the case that ‘all production under capitalism is commodity production’ (Mandel 1967: 10–1, quoted in Benston 1989: 33). According to
Mandel, the household produces ‘simple use-values’ which remain outside
of the commodity nexus (1967: 10–1, quoted in Benston 1989: 33).
Examples of the simple use-values to which Mandel refers include the
cleaning and ironing of laundry. While significant amounts of labour time
are invested in this activity, ‘it constitutes production, but it is not production for the market’ (Mandel 1967: 10–1, quoted in Benston 1989: 33).
Thus domestic labour time involves the transformation of commodities
purchased from salaried wages into consumables and the provision of
domestic services for household members (Harris 1983: 187). To this
extent the domestic labour time of women is first and foremost concerned
with production and only secondly concerned with consumption. Indeed,
it has been observed that domestic labour is located at the interface of two
markets – ‘the market for labour which it supplies, and the market for
consumer goods (wage goods) which it consumes’ (1983: 187). These
observations have encouraged Benston to argue that women constitute a
class of people that ‘does stand in a different relation to production than the
group ‘‘men’’’ (1983: 33). This is because the dominant form of domestic
division of labour in modern society abdicates males from the production
of simple use-values within the home. Thus, and according to Benston, we
can ‘tentatively define women . . . as that group of people who are
responsible for the production of simple use-values in those activities

associated with the home and family’ (Benston 1989: 34). Women’s
responsibility for the provision of simple use-values, within the home,
‘constitutes a huge amount of socially necessary production’ (Harris 1983:
33). Benston’s observations mapped onto a pivotal conjunction in the
history of materialist feminist discourse and latter inspired Dalla Costa and
James (1875: 31) to argue that ‘domestic work produces not merely usevalues, but it is essential to the production of surplus value’.

Domestic labour time and the production of surplus value

Dalla Costa and James (1975) proposed that women needed to be liberated
from capitalism’s rationalization of factory labour and from the endless
demands of private domestic labour. In the latter case the forces of production, which operate to privatize domestic labour also serve to constitute
it as ‘feminine work’ and a defining feature of womanhood (1975: 33). But
this identity is a source of frustration for women, partly because the relation
of housework to capital ‘runs directly against the factory as regimentation
organized in time and space’ (1975: 22). Domestic work is family-centred
and defined in relation to the needs of significant others (Davies 1990).
Conversely, the regimentation of work in the public sphere commands a
‘respect for timetables’ and disciplined aversion to any ‘disruption of the
productive flow’ (Dalla Costa and James 1975: 22). Nevertheless, capitalism is at the root of both the privatization of housework and its separation
from the chromomeric rhythms of the workplace. According to Dalla
Costa and James, the advent of capitalism precipitated a transition from a
pre-capitalist society of ‘co-operative unity in work’, to a capitalist system
in which ‘the unfree patriarch was transformed into the ‘‘free’’ wage earner’
(1975: 24). Having destroyed the community production of pre-capitalist
society, capital set about exacerbating the existing ‘contradictory experiences of the sexes’ and establishing in the form of the nuclear family ‘a
more profound estrangement and therefore a more subversive relation
between the sexes’ (1975: 24). With the rise of industrial capitalism, the
homestead ceases to be a centre of production and women lose their
relative power gained from the dependence of family members on their
labour, which was seen as socially necessary. The burden of financial
responsibility now resides solely with the patriarch and within the family:

[R]ule of capital through the wage compels every able-bodied person
to function, under the law of division of labour, and to function in
ways that are, if not immediately, then ultimately profitable to the
expansion and extension of the rule of capital.
(Dalla Costa and James 1975: 28)

To the extent that the ‘rule of capital’ determines the division of labour,
then the qualitative rhythms of housework ‘function in ways’ which are
‘ultimately profitable’ to the capitalist mode of production. This is because
domestic labour is of necessity to capital, not merely as a producer of use

values, but also because it ‘is essential to the production of surplus value’
(1975: 33). While previous Marxist feminists stressed the socially necessary
role of housework, Dalla Costa and James argue that domestic labour is the
necessary condition for the ‘reproduction of labour power’, from which, in
turn, is extracted surplus value. This is precisely because capitalism transfers
a vast amount of social services into the privatized nuclear family. Women
assume responsibility for these social services ‘without a wage and without
going on strike’ (1975: 34). Thus, according to this argument, what is
economically productive about housework is that capitalism, by instituting
its family structure, guarantees the exploitative bases of domestic labour and
in so doing sustains the capitalist organization of work. But herein resides a
primary source of contradiction in this Marxist feminist contribution. For
Marx, the raison d’eˆtre of capitalism’s organization of work is the expropriation of surplus labour time as a basis for the accumulation of capital. If
indeed it is the case that ‘the family is the very pillar of the capitalist
organization of work’ (Dalla Costa and James 1975: 35), then it would be
in the interest of capital to rationalize housework by integrating it with
technological innovations, designed to make it more efficient.
The argument is often advanced that Marx considered a primary
intention of capitalist production was to eliminate all forms of socially
necessary labour and subjugate them to ‘the hegemony of capital’ (Foreman 1978: 117). Evidence to support this claim is provided in Grundrisse in
which Marx explored the circumstances essential for socially necessary
labour to migrate ‘into the domain of the works undertaken by capital
itself’ (1973: 531). Marx states that ‘there are works and investments which
may be necessary without being productive in the capitalist sense, i.e.,
without the realization of the surplus labour contained in them through
circulation, through exchange, as surplus value’ (1973: 531). In specific
circumstances, capital may decide to undertake such works based on the
presumption that it will obtain ‘out of the general fund of profits – of
surplus values – a sufficiently large share to make it the same as if it had
created surplus value’ (1973: 532). Ultimately capital strives to be able to
transform the process of social production into commodities produced
through exchange relations. Thus, Marx argued that:

The highest development of capital exists when the general conditions of the process of social production are not paid out of deductions
from the social revenue, the state’s taxes – where revenue and not
capital appears as the labour fund, and where the worker, although he
is a free wage worker like any other, nevertheless stands economically
in a different relation – but rather out of capital as capital.
(Marx 1973: 532)

In other words, Marx anticipated the development of capital to eventually
‘subjugate all conditions of social production to itself’, thus guaranteeing
that all ‘social reproductive wealth has been capitalized and all needs are
satisfied through the exchange form’ (1973: 532). Clear parallels exist here


-----

Economies of time and gender 71

between Marx’s prophetic analysis and the expansion of commodity
markets into the public and private domains. With the rise of industrial
capitalism, there occurs a separation of the public sphere from the private
sphere and with this a ‘transfer of creative activity at home (private domain)
to the socially organized workplace (public domain)’ (Firat 1994: 211). In
industrial capitalist society, the production of commodities, within the
private sphere, has been systematically superseded by the purchase of
products in the market. Initially products produced in the public domain
were designed to augment the creative activities within the private sphere.
Examples of these products included raw wool, spinning and knitting tools,
agricultural appliances and sewing machines. Gradually these products
‘have been replaced by their end products’ (1994: 211). Consumer markets
now contain ready-made substitutes for the creative labour that previous
generations invested in the production of objects. And this transfer of
creative labour from the home to the public sphere has had much to do
with the growth of mass production, because it was necessary for capitalists
to generate corresponding mass consumer markets (Gardiner 1976; Zaretsky 1976; Firat 1994).
Indeed it has been suggested that gender segregation in the labour
market is a necessary component of mass production, as the household has
‘to be populated during the day in order to have continual consumption to
absorb the increasing production capabilities in the public domain’ (Firat
1994: 212). So although an increasing array of products now substitutes for
the creative labour women performed in the private sphere, countervailing
forces, within the labour market, encourage women into ‘the private
domain in order to consume the products’ (1994: 212). From this perspective it is clear that the relationship between capitalist enterprise and
housework has largely failed ‘to convert private domestic work . . . into a
public industry’ (Engels 1968: 569). This shortcoming is even more disconcerting when we consider that the restless agitation of capital operating
within the industrial process has historically provided the impetus for the
transformation of the labour process through the development of new
technologies (Seccombe 1974: 16). Given that labour time is a primary
source of value, ‘any increase in the productivity of a unit of labour time
results in a proportional increase in surplus value’ (1974: 16). To this
extent, it has been the modus operandi of capitalist industry to increase the
productivity of every unit of salaried labour time. It is this tendency in
capitalist accumulation, which has also been a source of confrontation
between capital and labour. Indeed, in the history of the working class
struggle, technology has been a valuable means of ‘gaining free hours’
(Dalla Costa and James 1975: 29). But this has not been the case for
housework. It would appear that ‘a high mechanization of domestic chores
doesn’t free any time for the woman’ (1975: 29).
Marxist feminists point out that Marx’s analysis of ‘social reproductive
wealth’ falls short of explaining why housework has not been ‘capitalized’
and thus transformed into a system in which ‘all needs are satisfied through


-----

the exchange form’ (Marx 1973: 532). For some feminist writers, the
problem resides with Marx’s gender-blind economic analysis of value and
his failure to recognize that the woman ‘is always on duty, for the machine
doesn’t exist that makes and minds children’ (Dalla Costa and James 1975:
29). For other feminist writers, the problem is less empirical and more
conceptual. Thus, Seccombe (1974) argues that any disjuncture between
Marx’s analysis of socially necessary labour and the apparent inability of
capitalist society to draw housework into a direct relation to capital has to
be explained in terms of a misinterpretation, by materialist feminists, of
Marx’s theory of value.

Housework: necessary but unproductive labour

Marxist feminists generally agree that ‘women’s oppression’ in the private
sphere is caused by capital. Consensus also exists around the claim that
domestic labour creates use-values, which are consumed within the
household. Furthermore, there is little contention that ‘domestic labour has
been socially necessary labour, throughout history and continues to be so
under capitalism’ (Seccombe 1974: 10). Significant disagreement does,
however, exist as to whether the general attributes of domestic labour
‘make the case for it being a productive labour in the specific context of
capitalist production’ (1974: 10). Using Marx’s distinction between productive and unproductive labour, Seccombe argues that ‘domestic labour is
unproductive’ (1974: 11). For Seccombe there exists abundant evidence to
confirm Marx’s inferred designation of domestic labour as unproductive.
Thus, Seccombe quotes Marx’s statement outlining the productivity of
labour, which Marx states is:

not derived from the material characteristics of labour (neither from
the nature of its product, nor from the particular character of the
labour as concrete labour), but from the definite social form, the social
relations of production within which labour is realized.
(Marx Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 157, quoted in Seccombe 1974: 11)

Thus, the attribute which defines productive labour is not the material
characteristic of labour, but rather, ‘the definite social form, the social
relations of production within which labour is realized’ (Marx, Capital,
Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 157, quoted in Seccombe 1974: 11). Furthermore,
Marx argues that ‘value is determined by objectified labour time’ (1973:
532) and ‘the labourer alone is productive who produces surplus value for
the capitalist’ (Marx, Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 477). Marx thus defines
productive labour as distinguished by two characteristics; it is performed in
direct relation with capital, and it produces surplus value. According to
Seccombe (1974: 11), domestic labour, while being ‘socially necessary
labour’ does not meet either of Marx’s criteria for discerning productive
labour. The relation of domestic labour with capital is neither direct (i.e., it
is not salaried) nor a source of surplus value (does not create more value


-----

Economies of time and gender 73

than it possesses). To this extent, Seccombe concludes that domestic labour
is unproductive labour (in the economic sense) and conforms with Marx’s
description of an unproductive labour ‘exchanged not with capital but with
revenue, that is wages or profits’ (1974: 11). Seccombe’s observations,
concerning the unique duality of productive labour, encouraged him to
examine an alternative means of expressing the value of domestic labour.
To this endeavour Seccombe re-evaluated the relationships between
domestic labour and the wage form. Seccombe argued that both the
husband and wife ‘as members of the same consumption unit’ have a shared
‘common interest in the wage’s magnitude, while being sharply differentiated from its form’ (1974: 12). But this shared interest is obfuscated by
the fact that the ‘husband receives a pay cheque while his wife does not’
(1974: 12). According to Seccombe, the wage has a ‘mystifying quality’,
which obscures the fact that ‘the wage in reality pays for an entirely different labour – the labour that reproduces the labour power of the entire
family’ (1974: 12). This forms part of the sine qua non of capitalism, i.e., the
reproduction of the forces of production (labour power). Domestic labour
fulfils this function in its capacity to reproduce labour power on ‘a daily
basis’ and also ‘on a generational basis’ (1974: 14).
But the ‘housewife’s labour cannot assert itself’ as it is ‘embodied in
another person’ and this denies it a ‘direct relation with capital’ (1974: 20).
Instead, the housewife’s labour, in its capacity to convert wage-purchased
goods into use-values, ‘becomes part of the congealed mass of past labour
embodied in labour power’ (1974: 9). Domestic labour, according to this
logic, is situated ‘beyond the exercise of the law of value’ (1974: 16). And it
is for this reason that, despite developments in the technological complexity of domestic appliances, ‘the domestic labour process has stagnated
while the industrial labour process has constantly advanced’ (1974: 17).
Labour time embodied in productivity is a source of value, and of vital
interest to capital. Nevertheless, Seccombe argues that ‘domestic labour is
not part of variable capital’, it is not hourly paid salaried wage and thus
‘capital has no interest in the productivity of a unit of domestic labour time’
(1974: 17). The amount of time required to complete a domestic task is
irrelevant to capital as long as this domestic labour time succeeds in its
overall task of reproducing the labour force. To this extent it appears
unsurprising ‘that the household is the least efficient organization of a
labour process existent within capitalism’ (1974: 17). It is certainly the case
that while the productivity of labour time (expended in housework) has
increased, it continues to be labour-intensive, monotonous work.
Nevertheless, Seccombe’s observations struggle to explain the stagnation of
the domestic labour process relative to technological developments in
industrial production.
According to Seccombe, the deluge of mass-produced domestic appliances into the home should not be read as ‘a progressive application of
technology’ (1974: 17). This is because capitalism’s history of building into
commodities the conditions for their rapid obsolescence, means that


-----

74 Gender and work in capitalist economies

capital’s profit motive can be served ‘by the most inefficient product
application in order to maximise the quantity of goods consumed per
person’ (1974: 17). And this, according to Seccombe, explains the short
product life cycles of new domestic technologies combined with their
erratic development. Because domestic labour time has no direct relation
to capital, ‘there exists no continual impetus to reorganize domestic labour
to improve its efficiency’ (1974: 17). But this conclusion is unconvincing.
Even the most cursory perusal of high street stores reveals the market for
domestic technologies to be a fiercely competitive sphere of commodity
production. Housework would indeed be made more efficient if it were
fully integrated into commodity production, but this transformation in the
domestic labour process appears to be tethered by forces which exceed
market dynamics. Indeed, it has been suggested that the possibilities of
capital automating domestic work run up against the combined forces of
patriarchy and the discursive constructions of ideal feminine identity (Dalla
Costa and James 1975).
In as much as ideal feminine identity defines womanhood in terms of the
maintenance of the home and family, the quest for this ideal engages
feminine subjects in practices which encourage ‘compulsive perfection in
their work’ (Dalla Costa and James 1975: 37). We are all familiar with the
saying ‘a woman’s work is never done’. Yet we are less familiar with the
conditions which serve to reproduce this construction of feminine identity.
Diana Gittins (1994) provides several important observations concerning
feminine identity and domestic labour time in the nineteenth-century
household. She argues that the demands placed on domestic labour time
were invariably linked to discourses which equated cleanliness with both
feminine identity and class. To the extent that cleanliness was equated with
class, women often distinguished their living standard and themselves
‘through the type of accommodation they have, its degree of cleanliness
and maintenance’ (1994: 121). Indeed, in the nineteenth century, household cleanliness signified ‘respectability’ and was exclusively defined as
women’s work (Davidoff 1976). Thus developments in technology and
house work had direct implications for the production of feminine identity. Instead of saving labour time, domestic appliances became essential
apparatus in the feminine quest for the immaculately furnished and
polished home. Arguably advertising promotions operated to sustain this
discourse (Odih 2007). For example, in the 1890s, the Steel Roll Manufacturing Company widely advertised its newly developed washing
machine. The advertising copy was emblematic of advertising’s dualistic
engagement with both the commodity market, and the promotion of
household labour-saving technologies as a source of feminine identity.
Thus, the advertising copy states ‘Washing Machine for the Residence.
Modern and complete with ample capacity to do all the family linen and do
it just right.’ Within the advertising system, the productivity of domestic
labour is at one and the same time a market place and a site for the
production of consumer subjectivities.


-----

Economies of time and gender 75

The early twentieth century witnessed a further revolution in household
gadgets marketed as labour-saving devices. The electrical appliances
industry, buttressed by a revolution in advertising, recognized the commercial value of the household as a market for domestic appliances. By the
1950s, the blossoming advertising industry had become rapturous in its
endeavours to inculcate ‘the ideal of the permanently immaculate home
and the need to buy more and more gadgets to keep it that way’ (Gittins
1994: 122). Thus advertisements, directed at the 1950s homemaker,
depicted ideal femininity as synonymous with an impeccably dressed and
coiffured mother (Kates and Shaw-Garlock 1999). Homes were not just
clean, but seen to be immaculately clean. Advertising collaborated in an
ideology of perfectionism, which contrived to increase, rather than
decrease, the amount of time dedicated to domestic chores. Consequently,
although advances in domestic appliances required that less time be dedicated to completing a task, the levels of quality now required to accomplish
the task operated to extend domestic labour time. These observations
suggest the inadequacy of economic reductionism when examining gender
and domestic labour time. Nevertheless it is impossible to have a notion of
production which does not also involve reproduction (Beechey 1979: 75).
Consequently an understanding of time and domestic labour requires a
comprehension of the ‘interrelations between production and reproduction as part of a single process’ (1979: 75).

Conclusion: capital accumulation in non-economic times

In the variety of Marxist feminisms discussed thus far, there is some
agreement that domestic labour is ‘engaged in the maintenance and
reproduction of labour power as a source of surplus labour’ (Gardiner
1976: 114). With the rise of industrial capitalism, women are defined as
domestic labourers and this forms the basis of capitalism’s expropriation of
domestic labour time as a source of value. But there is a tendency, in this
form of analysis, to view the capitalist–proletarian relationship ‘as a product
of the universal and all-determining force of capitalism’ (Williams 1988:
50). Thus Marxist feminist analysis all too often focuses on ‘capital – not on
relations between men and women’ (Hartmann 1981: 9). Capitalism is
viewed as ‘an abstract entity existing independent of’ gender relations
(Williams 1988: 50). Heidi Hartmann argues that leading exponents of the
Domestic Labour as Productive Labour debate fall short of recognizing the
significance of gender relations in determining the ‘strategic role of
women’s work in this system’ (1981: 9). To this extent, Hartmann is
particularly critical of Dalla Costa and James. Hartmann claims that while
the ‘rhetoric of feminism’ is present in their work, it fails to consistently
highlight ‘that the importance of housework, as a social relation, lies in its
crucial role in perpetuating male supremacy’ (Dalla Costa and James 1975:
9). Although this is a convincing critique, it is not immediately apparent


-----

76 Gender and work in capitalist economies

that Dalla Costa and James do obscure the role of gender difference in
determining the subjugation of women as domestic labourers. Indeed,
Dalla Costa and James make ample reference to the acquisition of feminine
and masculine identities as an important factor in the ‘relation between
time-given-to-housework and time-not-given-to-housework’ (1975: 36).
Some evidence of this is apparent in the following extract:

it is not necessary to spend time each day ironing sheets and curtains,
cleaning the floor until it sparkles nor to dust every day. And yet
many women still do that. Obviously it is not because they are stupid
. . . In reality, it is only in this work that they can realize an identity
precisely because, as we said before, capital has cut them off from the
process of socially organized production.
(Dalla Costa and James 1975: 36)

It would appear that Dalla Costa and James did recognize gender acquisition as a determinant of a woman’s ability to identify with her ascribed
role as a producer of use-value. Nevertheless it is clearly evident that Dalla
Costa and James are focusing on capital as a primary determinant of gender
identity, thus obscuring the extent to which ‘men have a material interest
in women’s continued oppression’ (Hartmann 1981: 9).
An alternative position is to argue that the acquisition of masculine and
feminine identities constitutes the ideological ground for material relations
to the mode of production. Clear parallels exist between the instrumental
time of the productive economy and masculine ways of being. Masculinity
is recognized, here, to be a dynamic process rather than a fixed quantity or
unalterable subject position which conflates physiology and gender identity. Masculinity is not entrenched in time or place, nor does it endure as
some trans-historical substance. What connotates masculinity, at any given
moment, is itself diverse and in transition. Acknowledging that ‘what
counts as masculine may shift over historical periods’ and even ‘over the
lifetime of the individual’, it is evident that contemporary masculine
identities are discursively bound up with high levels of purposive-rational
instrumentality in relation to a world that there is an urge to control
(Kerfoot and Knights 1996: 86). It is no mere accident that the discourses
of masculinity and economic linear time are both aligned and dominant in
modern Western society. Not only are they conditions and consequences
of one another but they also reflect and reinforce Western preoccupations
with economic growth and competitive success. However, neither of these
discourses are exhaustive of relations of gender and of time. In the discursive struggle for the signified feminine, the meaning of femininity is
both socially produced and variable between different forms of discourse.
Amid the plurality of feminine subject positions, there exist versions of
femininity discursively represented as the feminine ideal. While the discursive constructs of this ideal shift and are transformed according to sociohistorical context, modern representations of the feminine ideal have come
to be bound up with behaviours which deny the value of self and


-----

Economies of time and gender 77

autonomy, define meaningful existence as achieved through the care of
others and through displays of social and sexual passivity (1996: 87).
For many women and some men the culmination of the feminine ideal
finds expression in the subordination of self to the ‘needs’, demands and
desires of significant others, be they family members, friends, superordinates, etc. Femininity, then, is an ideal that, in emphasizing acquiescence, leaves little space for an active and autonomous subject who can
place equal demands upon those whose labour and identity are serviced by
contemporary heterosexual arrangements. In this sense, the feminine ideal
is expressive of a relational mode of engaging with the world. It is for this
reason that the phrase ‘no time to call our [her] own’ has an immediate
resonance for many women. For unlike the projects prevalent within
masculine discursive configurations that have finite time scales in which
measures of achievement can be imposed, feminine work is unending and
almost infinite in its ceaseless circularity.
It is evident that capital accumulation requires a reservoir of noneconomic times as a basis for the production of relative surplus value. In
modern regimes of capitalist accumulation, this has translated into the
universal appropriation of the social times of embodied relations. For those
caught up in feminine discourses, meaning and direction derive from
embeddedness in embodied social relations. Just as the feminine self is
defined in terms of the ‘needs’ of others, so experiences of time come to be
defined in relation to these very same ‘needs’. Put differently, the centrality
ascribed to others by those caught up in feminine discourses encourages
what is described here as ‘relational’ perceptions of time (Davies 1990;
1994).
Just as production founded on absolute surplus value expropriates the
objectified time of ‘value-creating labour’ (Marx 1973: 410), so the production of relative surplus value entails the exploitation of a feminine self,
which is defined by the ‘needs’ of others. Rarely in the domestic sphere
can time be conceived of as existing infinite, quantitatively discrete units
that are readily demarcated between, for example, work and leisure or
personal time (Adam 1993: 172). A condition and consequence of
women’s subordinate position in the public sphere, and their ascribed
domestic role in the private sphere, are that of significantly inhibiting their
power to make decisions about their own time and that of others. To this
extent domestic labour time is inextricably tied to the materialism of
modern existence, and the social practices which flow from capital accumulation. Chapter 4 develops this proposition with an emphasis on time,
work and gendered subjectivity.

When I started the job, I felt that I was doing more than I have ever
done. I just felt like I wanted to sleep all the time. And even now
when people come round and I am tired, or the phone rings, I just
feel like saying, Oh, just go away, leave me alone! But I don’t say that,
instead I open the door or answer the phone, despite the fact that I am
exhausted from being at work all day . . . I just feel like too many
demands are being made on me. Like today, for example, I had loads
of patients in at one time and it’s so frustrating when that happens
because I can’t tend to them as I would like to. Instead I could only
give each patient a specific amount of attention and move on to the
next. Sometimes I find myself thinking that I’m just not being fair to
my patients. But when I spend too much time on them, I just get
myself into a mess and overlap into other appointments and then end
up having to reschedule appointments or refer them to other colleagues. And that doesn’t reflect well on me, it makes me look
inefficient. But that shouldn’t be what it’s all about anyway . . . It
shouldn’t be about efficiency and management, chasing upgrades and
scoring points. And that’s even more frustrating because everyone is
so wrapped up in the management side of things, and how it can
benefit them, they forget the most important aspect of our work and
that is ensuring the well-being of our patients!

Why can’t this individual provide her patients with the attention that she
would otherwise provide? What factors constrain her? Why does providing
more attention to her patients encourage disarray/a ‘mess’? And why is she
not attracted to pursuing the career enhancing efficiency practices of her
colleagues?

Although there are potentially infinite readings and meanings that might
be attributed to this transcription, her actions are understood here as
reflective of a struggle to accommodate an embodied attachment to her
patients, with other less embodied influences. Primarily informed by
empirical research, this chapter examines gender and identity in modern
times. It is my contention that the discursive constructs of ‘femininity’
encourage an embodied, ‘relational’ existence to the world. A condition and
consequence of this ‘relational’ mode of existence are that those individuals
caught up in ‘feminine’ discourses tend to experience their time as ‘relational’. ‘Relational time’ is defined here as an experience of time that ‘exists’
in relation to an embeddedness in embodied social relations. Mediated
through significant others, relational time is shared rather than personal and
thus sensitive to the contextuality and particularity of interpersonal relations.
In previous years, several authors (Davies 1990, 1994; Leccardi and
Rampazi 1993, Deem 1996; Leccardi 1996) have variously argued that
men and women use time differently due to their distinct life-situations.
The routinized circularity and repetitiveness of domestic labour (encapsulated by the phrase a ‘woman’s work is never done’) are identified as
exemplifying the incompatibility of women’s work with linear conceptions
of time (Davies 1990; Le Feuvre 1994). This body of literature provides a
highly insightful attempt to deconstruct dominant understanding(s) of time
through drawing our attention to women’s time as embodied in daily life.
While feminist suggestions of distinct male and female times draw our
attention to the significance of gender in the discursive constitution of
linear time, their insufficient theorization of power and subjectivity has the
unintended effect of reproducing the very phallocentric discourse that
feminism seeks to challenge.
Conversely, primarily informed by the writings of Foucault (1982), the
discourse of gendered time expressed here has as its premise a conceptualization of power and subjectivity as grounded in the exercise of
power/knowledge through social practices in which subjects are embedded. For power exists in its exercise and is not simply a zero-sum relationship of inequality. As Foucault expresses it, ‘Power exists only when it
is put into action, even if, of course, it is integrated into a disparate field of
possibilities brought to bear upon permanent structures’ (1982: 219). To
this extent ‘power relations are rooted deep in the social nexus, not
constituted ‘‘above’’ society as a supplementary structure’ (1982: 222). In so
far as power is embedded in the ‘social nexus’, subjectivity exists in
reciprocal relation to power. Individual self-consciousness is configured
through the exercise of power within, which apprehensions of personal
identity come to be engendered. To quote Kerfoot and Knights (1994: 70):

Where subjectivity is constructed in and through discourse, the
gender identity of men and women as masculine and feminine subjects is socially constituted in and through certain sites, behaviours and
practices at any one time.

Gender and identity in modern times 83

Gender identities are, in this sense, historically contingent, unstable and
potentially multifarious. This notion of the discursive production of gendered subjects within and between power relations, provides a means of
reconciling women’s time/linear time dualism inherent in feminist discourses of gendered time. For example, feminine time is conceptualized
here as a form of time experienced by those whose identities are discursively constituted as feminine and therefore not exclusive to or
exhaustive of women. The dualistic opposition between essential female
time and equally essential male’s time/linear time, evident in feminist
discourses of gendered time, is dissolved when one recognizes reciprocity
in the discursive constitution of gender identities and their potential
multiplicity.
This chapter is divided into two main sections. The first commences
with an analysis of power, subjectivity and self that is capable of advancing
a discourse of gendered time, which escapes the problems of disembodied
dualisms and essentialism. The section then proceeds to reveal how the
discursive constructs of femininity resonate, with difficulty, with the
equally discursively constituted constructs of linear time.
The second section has as its central objective that of unravelling the
often conceptually problematic interconnections between women, femininity and relational time. This section identifies how the materialism of
modern existence (i.e., capitalist modes of production) and the social
practices that flow from it reflect and reinforce expressions of time
grounded in the hegemony of commodified, economically valued, individualistic linear time. A condition of women’s subordinate position in the
public sphere, and their ascribed domestic responsibilities in the private
sphere, is that of significantly inhibiting their power to make decisions
about their own time and also that of encouraging an existence that is
discursively tied to the ‘needs’ of significant others. More specifically, this
chapter argues that feminine perceptions of time as relational, while open
to resistance, tend to prevail among women by virtue of a dominant and
comparatively impermeable gendered employment segregation and sexual
division of labour, both in formal employment and in the home. It is in this
sense, that experiences of time as relational tend to be disproportionately
exhibited by female subjects.

Power, subjectivity and gendered identities

The concept of power has, and continues to be, a contentious issue in
feminist discourses of women’s oppression. Feminists continue to be
constrained by, or in contention with, their ancestral ties to Enlightenment
thought and its assumptions about the relation between power and
knowledge, reality and truth, cause and effect, freedom and the nature of
human agency (Hekman 1990:83). Where feminists have been concerned
to theorize women’s differential social and economic position in terms of


-----

84 Gender and work in capitalist economies

patriarchal practices, this reflects and reinforces the Enlightenment’s totalizing, androcentristic, conditions of truth, knowledge and power. Patriarchal power, conceptualized as existing in a variety of institutional forms,
patriarchal practices and relations collectively acting to oppress the female
sex, translates as men ‘having power’ over women (Kerfoot and Knights
1994: 70). This comprehension of power as the capital of some to the
preclusion of others, ‘sets up a dichotomous relationship between the
individual and the social world, between powerful men and powerless
women as largely internally undifferentiated categories, and imputes a
passivity to all women’ (1994: 70). An insistence on the all-inclusive
character of female oppression in terms of the common undifferentiated
enemy, patriarchy, and inability to develop differentiated analyses of cultural and historical contexts mitigates against a comprehension of complexity and diversity in female experiences. To participate in this discourse,
then, would engage feminists in a discourse which homogenizes female
experiences and in so doing, obscures the possibilities for female subjects to
exercise agency and creativity within conditions of social constraint.
An alternative formulation (Foucault 1980, 1982) is to envisage power as
‘existing only in its exercise, operating through the production of particular
knowledges – around discourses of gender and sexuality. . .’ (Kerfoot and
Knights 1994: 70). In this viewpoint, power is neither unidirectional, nor
does it proceed from a unitary derivation to ‘shape, direct or constrain
subjects’ (1994: 70). Foucault articulates the relational character of power,
whose existence depends on ‘the recalcitrance of the will and the intransigence of freedom’ (1982: 222). The diaphaneity of discourses and their
material trajectories in social institutions and practices is intrinsic to the
continuance of power since ‘reality’ derives meaning through language.
Yet language, as translated through sociohistorical discourses, derives its
political affectivity only through the meaningful constructions of agents
who identify with the forms of subjectivity it advances and act upon them
(Weedon 1987). Power, therefore, is in reciprocal relation to ‘subjectivity’,
where subjectivity can be delimited as individual self-consciousness
inscripted into ideals of normative behaviour surrounding groupings of
individuals, objects practices or institutions. ‘Subjectivity is constituted
through the exercise of power within which conceptions of personal
identity, gender and sexuality come to be generated’ (Kerfoot and Knights
1994: 70). Consequently, the individual who has a ‘discursively constituted
sense of identity may resist particular interpollations or produce new
versions of meaning from the conflicts and contradictions between existing
discourses’ (Weedon 1987: 106). Gendered subjectivities are, therefore,
historically shifting, fractured, inherently capricious and potentially
multifarious (Kerfoot and Knights 1996). Accepting that the nature of
identity and subjectivity is inherently unstable, Mouffe (1992: 372) argues
that the social agent is:


-----

Gender and identity in modern times 85

constituted by an ensemble of ‘subject positions’ that can never be
totally fixed in a closed system of differences, constructed by a
diversity of discourses among which there is no necessary relation, but
a constant movement of overdetermination and displacement. The
‘identity’ of such a multiple and contradictory subject is therefore
always contingent and precarious, temporally fixed at the intersection
of those subject positions and dependent upon specific forms of
identification.

Acknowledging the existence of multiple masculinities/femininities draws
attention to the precariousness of gender identity. This is to conceive of a
secure identity as an aspiration to be achieved where the final stage is
always illusive, forever out of reach and constantly in flux. Gender identity
must, therefore, be worked at, acquiring the status of a ‘personal project’ to
be accomplished through continuous practice (Kerfoot and Knights 1996).
Moreover, ‘becoming’ a gendered subject, is never a linear process because
that implies a pre-social body and also a temporally discrete origin to
gender, after which it is fixed in form.
To articulate ‘becoming’ in this way is to espouse a view that refuses
certainty, universality or constancy in what it means to be a male or female
subject. One might suggest that drawing attention to the potential
multiplicity of gender identities invites a collapse into relativism whereby
there are, for example, as many different permutations of masculinity as
there are men. While it is axiomatic that masculinity, no less than femininity, is seen as manifest in a multiplicity of forms and not as a confirmed
entity, it is possible to identify their prevailing manifestations. I shall now
identify the discursive constructs of prevailing forms of masculinity. This
leads on to a discussion of how the discursive constructs of masculinity
resonate with the equally discursively constituted constructs of linear time.

Masculin(ities)

To reiterate a previous statement, gender and gender differences are
conceptualized, here, as in a dynamic process where masculinity is an
outcome of social practices rather than a fixed amount that any one
individual may possess. Masculinity is not consolidated in time or place,
nor does it exist as some trans-historical attribute. Cultural delineations of
what counts as masculinity are themselves, at specific moments, diverse and
in flux (Kerfoot and Knights 1996). Acknowledging that there are multiple
and disparate forms of masculinity, it is suggested here, as elsewhere
(Kerfoot and Knights 1996) that modern masculine identities are discursively bound up with high levels of purposive-rational instrumentality
in relation to a world that there is a drive to control. Seidler (1989)
describes this form of control as one that equates with detached reason,
logic and rational process. Modern masculinity generates social relations


-----

86 Gender and work in capitalist economies

dedicated to fierce competition, hierarchical authority, careerism and the
language of winning, which is in turn bound up with decisive action, a
logic of productivism and risk-taking. ‘Only the never ending supply of
new conquests, challenges and uncertainties keep those caught up in such
masculine discourses forever trapped in a permanent striving to be in
control’ (Kerfoot and Knights 1996: 80). In this sense, masculinity is
compulsive and inevitably self-defeating. While it has as its objective
control, attainment of this aim is inevitably transient, forever having to be
renewed by new projects, new aims, new conquests and the (inevitably
unpredictable) approval of others. As Seidler (1989: 192) puts it, masculinity’s preoccupation with control translates as a ‘desperate striving
without ever really experiencing the joy of fulfilment’.
At a level of personal social engagement, it is invariably the apprehension
of capitulating control that induces rational instrumentality in those caught
up in masculine discourses. An instrumental-purposive regime of action
configures social relationships, conquering or reinterpreting alternative
expressions of ‘being’, to accord with an archetype of instrumental action.
Whatever enters the terrain of rational calculation must be conceived as
‘other’. This instrumental relationship to social relations and compulsive
desire to be in control are ultimately expressive of an instrumental relationship to self (Seidler 1989). Self, as constructed through an abjuration or
devaluation of particular domains of human experience, becomes the
ultimate realm of control and cohibition. Masculinity, therefore, involves
the attachment to an instrumental achievement of identity through the
control of self and ‘other’.
Preoccupied with cognition and externalities, masculinity is expressive
of a distancing or disembodiment from the contextuality and particularity
of human experience. Where rational action is privileged above emotions,
feelings and desires, for those caught up in masculine discourses

this may translate into the denial or suppression of emotionality, fear
and uncertainty; the denial of human intimacy or suppression of
embodied experiences of pleasure and desire; and the denial of
‘contented passivity’ as an alternative mode of engaging with the
world.
(Burchell 1990, quoted in Kerfoot and Knights 1993: 672)

Modern forms of masculinity are discursively bound up with an
estrangement and disembodiment from the particularity of human
experiences. As Kerfoot and Knights put it:

[Masculinity] is abstract and highly instrumental with respect to
controlling . . . objects, thus sustaining a mode of relating to externalities that is self-estranged and wholly disembodied. Rarely does
masculinity embrace the world or even itself with a sense of wonderment, pleasure or estrangement, for it labours ceaselessly in the
struggle to control and possess the objects of its desire, whilst at the


-----

Gender and identity in modern times 87

same time self-deceptively presuming itself to be free of desire. That is
to say, the desire is so buried beneath a series of rationalities and
rationalizations as to be virtually invisible to its agent. Yet it may be
suggested that the hidden agenda behind masculine struggles for
control is a desire to produce a stable world in which identity can feel
safe and secure.
(Kerfoot and Knights 1996: 82)

In the compulsive endeavour to control self and ‘other’, the contextuality
of the present is transcended, swept aside in the insatiable quest for new
challenges, new conquests, new realms and objects of control. In this sense,
masculine ways of being appear to resonate with the equally discursively
constituted constructs of linear time.

On masculinity and linear time

As with dominant forms of modern masculinity, linear time entails a
perpetual transcendence from the contextuality and particularity of human
experience. For ‘the rationalisation of consciousness that supports the
continuity of past and future, cause and project necessarily supports kinds
of thinking that seek to transcend the present, concrete, arbitrarily and
absolutely limited moment’ (Ermarth 1992: 31). Linear time, by definition,
involves a kind of transcendence that trivializes the specificity of the finite
moment. It requires a kind of estrangement from the present that entails
dematerialization, abstraction and disembodiment. Every present in linear
time is in this way also the future. Issues of present value are deprived their
contextuality and reinscribed with the clockwork precision of a depth-less,
disembodied expression of time.
Linear time’s transcendence from the present resonates with masculinity’s compulsive hyperactivity. As with masculinity, the discursive constructs of linear time’s future orientation encourage ceaseless instrumental
planning and compulsive ‘possessive individualism’ (Macpherson 1962).
Masculinity’s goal-oriented instrumental planning encourages the pursuit
of abstract instrumental objectives that both reflect and reinforce a disembodied and estranged relationship to the world. This involves acting in
such a way as to maximize one’s returns with a view to the future. But the
future always becomes the present at its point of realization. Consequently,
masculinity strives to maximize its returns indefinitely; that is to say, into a
future that will never be realized. Masculinity’s propensity for instrumental
rational behaviour thus involves means–ends forms of behaviour where the
end is always a means towards a future end of exactly the same kind. In so
far as individuals are conceived of as having ends of this nature, they must
be supposed as having desires which linear time’s future orientation always
precludes.
The centrality ascribed to certain forms of masculinity in the discursive
constitution of linear time enables masculine ways of being to align with


-----

88 Gender and work in capitalist economies

the discursive constructs of linear time. If this is to be accepted, then by
inference less instrumental forms of masculinity and feminine ways of being
will struggle to resonate with the equally discursive constructs of linear
time. The foregoing discussion of gender identity is pertinent here for
several reasons. In contrast to other feminist discourses of gendered time
(Forman and Sowton 1989; Davies 1990; Leccardi 1996), the association
made here between linear time and masculinity resists any one-to-one
correlation between men, masculinity and linear time. Acknowledging the
precariousness of gender identities and the possibility of multiple masculinities/femininities draws attention to the need to theorize gendered time
in ways more sophisticated than a simple dualism between masculine time
and feminine time. Moreover, varieties of masculinity are constructed in
response to, and in reciprocity with prevailing forms and definitions of
femininity (Kerfoot and Knights 1996). In this sense femininity is cultivated in reciprocal relation to masculinity. In the same vein, gendered
perceptions of and relations to linear time are sustained in mutually constituting reciprocal relations. However, the materialism of modern existence, and the social practices that flow from it, reflect and reinforce a
resonance between particular forms of masculinity and the discursive
constructs of linear time. This has specific consequences for less instrumentally masculine and feminine ways of being. These consequences are
expressive of feminine perceptions of time, and relations to linear time.
The remainder of this chapter provides an account, informed by extensive
empirical research, of feminine relations to linear time at the level of
personal experience and social relationships.

On femininity and linear time

In the discursive struggle for the signified feminine, the meaning of femininity is both socially produced and variable between different forms of
discourse. Amid the plurality of feminine subject positions, exist versions of
femininity discursively represented as the feminine ideal. While the discursive constructs of this ideal shift and transform according to sociohistorical context, modern representations of the feminine ideal have come
to be bound up with behaviours which deny the value of self and
autonomy, and define meaningful existence as achieved through the care of
others and through displays of social and sexual passivity (Kerfoot and
Knights 1996: 87). Modern advertising, for example, offers us models of
femininity which, despite their apparent plurality, converge towards
representing ideal femininity in terms of acquiescing to the demands of
others. For many women, and some men, the culmination of the feminine
ideal finds expression in the subordination of self to the ‘needs’, demands
and desires of significant others, be they family members, friends, superordinates, etc. Femininity, then, is an ideal that in emphasizing acquiescence leaves little space for an active and autonomous subject who can


-----

Gender and identity in modern times 89

place equal demands upon those whose labour and identity are serviced by
contemporary heterosexual arrangements. In this sense, the feminine ideal
is expressive of a relational mode of engaging with the world. Those whose
identities are discursively constituted as feminine invariably derive meaningful existence, purpose and direction in terms of an embeddedness in
embodied social relations. In contrast to masculine desires to control self
and ‘other’, ‘feminine identities are dominated by attaining an impeccability of physical environment, character and bodily virtue, reflecting the
indeterminable flux of everyday interactions’ (Kerfoot and Knights 1998:
16). While the hyperactivity of masculinity involves a transgression of the
present, which is swept aside in the frenetic pursuit of new challenges, the
relational contingency of ideal femininity embraces the contextuality and
particularity of the present as evident in the following transcription excerpt:

In personal, social relationships, for example, in not having to plan
what might happen in the future, it’s actually valuing each contact
that I have with friends at the time and recognizing that I value it,
that’s one thing that I’ve thought about quite carefully. I suppose as
well, we’ve been talking about money, but not sort of saving vast
sums of money but just being happy that I can cope month to month
with things that are happening, not thumbing ahead. I suppose workwise it’s similar, I mean, although we have to have two years strategic
funds, actually being able to take each element as it comes and deal
with it. I cope with that by actions so that if I know that I’m doing
something today, I’m not going to worry about what I was going to
have to do next week until I come to it and, equally, I’ve not got to
worry about what happened last week. I learn to cope with this
week’s work. So as long as I know what is planned, then I can cope
with what’s happening there, it’s only future uncertainties that cause
me problems, personal and organizational.
(full-time paid manager of a voluntary organization, divorced,
one child)

Abstracted from context, devoid of content, linear time’s future orientation
is bereft of any emotional energy to allow one to question the futility of
‘possessive individualism’ and the transience of lived experiences that this
entails. Conversely, femininity’s embeddedness in embodied social relations allows for a sensitivity to the specificity of, and contextuality of, social
relations. Although the interviewee, in the above transcription excerpt, is
cognizant of her organization’s strategic plans, by dealing with each element as distinct (i.e., rather than as systematically tied to a two-year
strategic plan), it is the present rather than the future of these plans which is
given priority. The discursive constructs of femininity are expressive of an
engagement with the world which is at once immediate, sensual and
embodied. In contrast with linear time’s propensity for disembodiment,
feminine ways of being derive purpose and direction through a sensitivity
to the situationally contingent needs and desires of significant others. For


-----

this and other reasons, raised next, feminine discourses have a tendency to
be incompatible, or in conflict, with the clockwork, disembodied precision
of linear time.

Our time for others!

People ring me up in the middle of the night sometimes. A lot of
people tend to think that I can solve their problems. But the people
that do, tend to be the people that are still having the same problem
about five or six years later. It’s just a thing you get used to in the end,
and you just let them talk because you know that they are not going
to ever change anything, no matter what sort of advice you give them
or try to help them to see. But if anybody asks me to do something or
wants to talk to me, I am normally there and sometimes I get annoyed
with myself and think to myself, you’ve done it again, you should
have said no. But it’s hard to say no, especially when someone wants
to talk to you and it’s nice to know that someone trusts you enough to
want to talk to you.
(Full-time Dental Nurse, Unmarried, No Children)

The above transcription is derived from a conversation with a full-time
dental nurse located in a practice which I, reluctantly, frequent. It is pertinent here as it illustrates a mode of being which is not instrumentally
attached to securing itself through purposive-instrumental action and causal
directionality. As inferred in the transcript, she is clearly aware that the
conversations described may not result in any immediate or deferred
resolution. Rather, her understanding of self revolves around being
available to provide solace to her confidants, even if this may run up against
other aspects of her identity. This engagement with her self and others ‘is at
once immediate, sensual and embodied, not driven by cognitive and goalcentred designs and preoccupations’ (Kerfoot and Knights 1996:87). In her
desire to meet the ‘needs’ of others, self becomes subordinated to the
particularity and situational contingency of others’ ‘needs’. The latter part
of the transcript refers to an understanding of self which appears to be a
condition, and consequence, of a subordination of self to others, in that she
begins to infer the significance of interpersonal recognition to her personal
identity. Although it was stated previously that masculinity involves a
compulsive drive to achieve the approbation and approval of others, the
distinctiveness of feminine desires for public recognition resides in its
grounding in emotional validation (Kerfoot and Knights 1996). While
both modes of being might well be expressive of compulsive actions,
masculinity has as its intention the control of self and ‘other’. In contrast,
feminine desires for approval and recognition emanate from an attachment
and connectedness with others and have as their intention emotional
validation. This distinction is apparent in the following transcription
derived from a conversation with a primary school teacher:


-----

Gender and identity in modern times 91

Two children immediately come to mind, I know that with some
additional help, I could conquer their special needs. But I have
twenty-four other children that also need my attention. I’ve tried to
get additional support but my school can’t afford it. So I make up for
it, I stay behind during my lunch hours and hear them read to try and
bring up their reading levels. I wouldn’t have to give up my lunch
times if I felt the children were getting a fairer deal and I don’t think
they are. But it is also a bit of a self-agenda really. You see, we have
reading tests and it feels good to know that I have been able to bring a
child up from six and a half to eight on the scale. And then I can show
*** [name of the headmistress] what I have achieved. So, in fact,
there are two separate reasons really. I hear the children read during
my lunch time because I want them to do well. And secondly I want
*** [name of headmistress] to recognize me as a good teacher. But
she never seems to appreciate what I have achieved . . . Apparently she
told the OfSTED assessment officer, we had OfSTED several months
ago, that I was very conscientious. But it would mean a lot more if she
had said it to me.
(Full-time primary school teacher, unmarried, no children)

When I initially read through this transcript my thoughts were drawn to
masculinity, as a source of explanation, as to why this primary school
teacher was working through her lunch break to provide extra tuition for
her pupils. After all, as stated above, masculinity is associated with incessant
activity. At a further level of analysis, it became apparent that while the
primary school teacher’s action reflected the frenetic activity of
masculinity, her intention was not to achieve control through the approbation and approval of others. If that had been her intention, having
achieved the recognition of her senior colleague (vis-a`-vis her headteacher’s
comments to the OfSTED commissioner), the teacher’s actions might then
have been redirected to pursuing other challenges and conquests. Rather,
the primary school teacher’s continued pursuit of affirmation, from her
senior colleague, suggests that her actions are motivated by an embodied
attachment to this colleague and her pupils. In this sense, her desire for
approval is indicative of an embodied, interpersonal quest for emotional
validation. It might suffice here to say that just as the masculine self can
never secure the response of the other, so the feminine self’s attempts at
developing an embodied relation to an Other can never be guaranteed.
The feminine self, in its pursuit of embodied social relations, might also
find itself caught up in compulsive, frenetic activities. But while the
masculine self’s compulsive hyperactivity is motivated by the desire to
control self and other, the feminine self’s actions are motivated by a desire
for emotional validation.
The transcripts converge to represent a mode of being that is fundamentally embodied in social relations. Where, as is evident in these transcripts, self is defined in terms of the needs of others, so experiences of time


-----

92 Gender and work in capitalist economies

come to be defined in relation to these very same needs. The inextricable
links between feminine embodiment and personal experiences of time are
clearly evident in the primary school teacher’s decision to provide reading
tuition during her free time. Her subordination of self to the needs of her
pupils impacts on her availability to service these needs and thus her
personal experiences of time. Put differently, the centrality ascribed to
others by those caught up in feminine discourses encourages what is
described here as relational perceptions of time. Davies (1990: 15) defines
relational time as perceptions of time that exist in relation to significant
others, and identifies relational time as women’s time. While I have a
profound respect for, and appreciation of, Davies’s (1990, 1994) theoretical
and empirical contributions, the dualistic oppositions upon which her
alternative discourse of gendered time is grounded are significantly problematic. For example, when referring to gendered times, Davies states:

[L]inear time and clock time make up the dominant structure in our
present-day society, and this may be used . . . as an instrument of
power and control over women. (This, of course, would equally
apply to men who lack power.) As the dominant structure, women
must of course assimilate themselves into this temporal order and
indeed it is part and parcel of their way of relating to time: taken for
granted and often unquestioningly accepted. Alongside this though, is
another temporal pattern and consciousness which are more diffuse in
nature, being process and cyclically oriented. Due to the nature of
women’s reproductive work and women’s socialisation, women to a
larger extent than men are affected by this temporal consciousness.
(Davies 1990: 231)

Davies’s discourse is clearly guided by a zero-sum conception of power as
evidenced by the statement ‘This, of course, would equally apply to men
who lack power’. Similar conceptions of power are evident in Leccardi
(1993, 1996) and Forman and Sowton’s (1989) respective discourses on
gendered time. The reliance of these respective discourses on a conception
of power as the capital of a few, and located in a position of exteriority to
the individual, constructs a dichotomous relationship between forcible
men and ineffectual women as internally indistinguishable categories.
Consequently, when Davies proceeds to identify the operations through
which women come to identify with relational time, the zero-sum conception of power that informs her discourse is unable to articulate the
significance of identity, subjectivity and agency to the maintenance of these
processes. Hence, Davies is forced to resort to statements such as: ‘women
must of course assimilate themselves into this temporal order and indeed it
is part and parcel of their way of relating to time: taken for granted and
often unquestioningly accepted’ (Davies 1990: 231).
Specifically, Davies’s (1990, 1994) approach has difficulty recognizing
how female subjects become the sites and apparatus of power by identifying with, and contesting, forms of subjectivity that are the products of


-----

Gender and identity in modern times 93

specific configurations of discourse. The absence of a coherent theorization
of the social processes which maintain relational experiences of time invites
suggestions of essentialism (Ermarth 1989). Conversely, gendered subjectivities are conceptualized here as grounded in power/knowledge
relations; they are an outcome of social processes as opposed to a quantity
that any one person may acquire. Feminine and masculine modes of being
are not peculiar to or exhaustive of women and men respectively.
Acknowledging these caveats, relational time is defined, here, as an
expression of time reflective of the embeddedness, of those caught up in
feminine discourses, in embodied social relations. Mediated through significant others, relational time is shared rather than personal and thus
sensitive to the contextuality and particularity of interpersonal relations.
While disproportionately exhibited between the sexes, feminine conceptions of time, as relational, are neither synonymous with nor exclusive to
women. Rather, it is my view that gendered perceptions of time vary
between individuals and contexts but that masculine linear time is the more
dominant because of its centrality in the productive economy. The
materialism of modern existence and the social practices that flow from it
reflects and reinforces expressions of time grounded in the hegemony of
commodified, economically valued, individualistic linear time. A condition
of women’s subordinate position in the public sphere and their ascribed
domestic role in the private sphere, is that of significantly inhibiting their
power to make decisions about their own time and that of others. It is in
this sense, and for reasons discussed below, that experiences of time as
relational tend to be disproportionately exhibited by female subjects. The
following section focuses on the discursive constructs of motherhood as an
illustration of the significance of power/knowledge relations to the disproportionate experience of relational time by female subjects. In so doing,
I intend through illustration to further unravel the complex interconnections between femininity, women and relational time.

Domestic division of labour: timely reminders

Motherhood is neither a unitary experience, nor is it a simple one. To be a
mother demands that a woman takes on a complex identity (Richardson
1993). She is still herself but she is also a mother, with the incumbent roles,
responsibilities and relationships which this entails. While women define
their own expectations about mothering, they are also guided in this by
cultural ideas about motherhood, about what a ‘good’ mother is supposed
to do and be. The significance of cultural prescriptions, centred around
contemporary motherhood, to women’s everyday understandings of
motherhood is illustrated in the following transcription:

I think there is a physical tie. When you have a child, you are
attached. I remember reading this wonderful description of the life of
a woman brought up in a religious community . . . and she says that at


-----

94 Gender and work in capitalist economies

some point when she was not looking her mother tied a piece of
string around her heart and every now and then she tugs it and draws
her back. And it is about this bond that you have with your children,
and it is true no matter how hard you try to fight it. It is the other way
round as well when you have a baby, I have felt this with *** [my
daughter]. You have this physical bond to your child and you find it
very difficult to believe that anyone could look after the child as well
as you could, even its father.

With reference to the above transcript, while there are potentially infinite
meanings available to explain and determine mothering practice, only a
small proportion of what constitutes motherhood has been identified and
described here. Her description of motherhood is reflective of how the role
of ‘mother’ has been socially constructed through power/knowledge
relations, which encourage women to become mothers and practise
motherhood in historically specific, narrowly defined ways.
In the potential myriad of social prescriptions for motherhood certain
claims to knowledge are given priority over others, pass into popular
discourse and come to represent our everyday understandings of motherhood. For example, significant shifts and transformations in motherhood
practices during the 1950s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (Richardson 1993)
suggest the existence of discursive struggles to attach meaning to the signifier ‘motherhood’ and establish responsibility for child-rearing. These
discursive struggles in turn serve to reinforce and/or challenge, the –
sociohistorically contingent – relational demands made on a mother‘s time.
An indication of the significance of power/knowledge to contemporary
mothering practices can be revealed by focusing upon discursive struggles
to define motherhood in the 1970s and 1980s. While the childcare literature of the 1970s and 1980s continued to emphasize the infant’s
immense need for maternal attention, the content of this attention contrasted with the maternal deprivation theses of the 1940s and 1950s
(Richardson 1993). By the 1970s, the focus of expert attention had shifted
from the child’s emotional ‘needs’ to its intellectual development and this
had significant consequences for social prescriptions centred around the
relational demands made on a mother’s time (Nicholson 1993).
For example, primarily informed by scientific studies (Kaye 1977),
experts frequently conceptualized mother–child bonding in terms of a
dialectical process of reciprocal exchange. In association with the redefinition of the child as active recipient to interpersonal stimuli, ideal
motherhood came to be defined in terms of an interplay between
instinctive maternal bonding and the acquired skill of responding to a
particular infant in a reciprocal and synchronized manner (Richardson
1993). Scientific discourses suggesting the child’s potential for reciprocal
exchange and need for intellectual development served to undermine the


-----

Gender and identity in modern times 95

predominance of maternal bonding discourses about child-rearing, thus
sustaining the possibility that mutual parental influence might benefit
childhood learning (Stoppard 1984). However, the continued significance
(albeit less predominant) of maternal instinct to discourses of childhood
intellectual development, also attended to discourses suggesting the existence of different and distinct roles for women and men within the family.
It is the mother to whom is ascribed the capacity to recognize the child’s
intellectual processes and facilitate the highly synchronized patterns of
interaction (Kaye 1977). Sensitive or good child-rearing is, in this sense, a
skill, essentially associated with the mother and peripherally ascribed to the
father. The mother’s ‘essential’ skills enable her to respond to an infant in a
reciprocal and synchronized manner and thus ascribe to her the fundamental responsibility for the child’s learning experiences.
While it is axiomatic that understandings of motherhood may shift over
time, over the lifetime of individuals and in differing spatial and cultural
contexts, it is possible to recognize instantly some of its contemporary
discursive constructs. Within academic circles, popular culture and
everyday discourse, motherhood often implies some reference to selfsacrifice and the subordination of self to the needs of the infant. One
should, however, recognize that these discourses of motherhood rely upon
the identification of free subjects for their meaning and actualization. It is,
therefore, necessary to understand motherhood in terms of the existence of
complex discursive forces within which female subjects situate themselves,
and are situated, and come to identify with a mode of existence which has
at its centre the subordination of self to the needs of an infant. For example,
as Richardson (1993: 1) states, ‘though not all women perceive femininity
as a reward, for some its association with motherhood is an important
aspect of what they get out of being a mother’.
Where, as is evident in popular discourse, ideal womanhood is associated
with becoming a ‘good’ mother, for many women who strive to achieve
ideal womanhood, this involves them in identifying with modes of subjectivity which are the product of discourses of motherhood. Where these
discourses of motherhood propose an existence which entails the subordination of self to the needs of the child, women who identify with this
mode of subjectivity experience a relational existence to the needs of their
infant. A consequence of the female’s need-centred relational existence to
her child is that of perceiving her time as relational. The mother’s
experience of relational time manifests itself in an infinitesimal number of
ways. A familiar manifestation of the significance of relational time to
motherhood is expressed in the following transcription:

I think I had more, I did have more time then than now. You could
say two, three, maybe four hours during the day. But I think I never
really felt free of her because I was breast feeding her. I was therefore
indispensable, she wouldn’t take her bottle, and there were times that
I would feel very trapped. I couldn’t go anywhere, I couldn’t go

shopping, at the beginning, there were times that I couldn’t even go
to the shops without her. I felt that I couldn’t go anywhere and that
was very frustrating at times. The first time I went out to get my hair
cut and I came back and she had been bawling with somebody else
and I thought I can’t even get my hair cut !!! . . . When she is awake,
she requires an enormous amount of attention. It is very rarely that
you can sit and read a book or the newspaper or something when she
is around, she likes to be actively involved.

Looking after children, especially during infancy, is a tiring, demanding,
highly repetitive experience which can seem unending. Both the
assumption that women have a duty to take care of their children and the
expectation that they will find motherhood naturally rewarding make it
difficult for women, as mothers, to openly express feelings of dissatisfaction
and disappointment, anger or frustration (Richardson 1993). Moreover,
the hegemony of ideal motherhood discourses is such that the stresses of
motherhood may be experienced by women as their own ‘inadequacies’
(Boulton 1983; Brown et al. 1986). In this sense, becoming a better mother
and aspiring to the motherhood ideal are often subjectively perceived as a
solution to the frustrations and stresses of motherhood, as illustrated in the
following transcription:

It was just the same as the feeling that I had when I was working at the
tax office. A feeling of being, of my mind clogging up. I found myself
acting like a radio advert on television. Sort of like . . . the important
things in my life was whether my husband’s shirt was smelling all
right! Some of my friends who have come from a similar educational
background, have had children and this has completely fulfilled
everything that they wanted to do. I never felt like that I got bored.
I mean, physically I was actually shattered but mentally I was bored. I
couldn’t understand why they found it so satisfying. I couldn’t tell
them that it just made me feel tired all the time.
(part-time librarian (returner) married, one child)

Timely reflections

As inferred in the above transcripts, the power of mothering discourses are
such that the stresses and strains of mothering are often resolved through a
more resilient appeal to achieving the mothering ideal. In this sense,
women often find themselves caught in a constricting cycle of relational
time, motivated by the prospect of eventually achieving the subjective
fulfilment associated with the mothering ideal and, in so doing, eventually
alleviating their feelings of present despair. These, and factors discussed
previously, converge to experientially constitute motherhood as bereft of


-----

temporal demarcation. For many women, motherhood and mothering
practices often involve a fusion of personal time with the seemingly endless
needs and demands of their children.

I think the general running of the household does fall more to me.
*** [husband’s name] does do things but usually I have to ask. He
very seldom does things without being asked . . . When I’m not there
he switches on, but I have always found that with things like
household things, he tends to switch off. He just assumes that when
I’m here that I’m going to do it. It is like with the baby at night.
When she cries, I’m the one who wakes first. He wakes up if I give
him a nudge but then he says that she is crying for me. And then I
have to get up because she is still crying and then when she stops, he
says, ‘See, she was crying for you’ and goes back to sleep!!!
(full-time mother, married, two children)

In 2005, two-thirds of mothers and 55 per cent of mothers with children
under 5 were in employment (EOC 2006: 15). The significance of this
increase is evident when compared with the figure of 28 per cent of
mothers of under 5s in employment in 1975. Increasing numbers of
mothers are entering the labour market for greater proportions of their
lives than was the case in previous decades. At the same time women retain
the well-enshrined, female responsibility for domestic work and childcare.
Statistical analysis of labour market data consistently confirms the extent to
which female labour market participation is configured by domestic circumstances (Walby 2007). Nevertheless, it is equally significant to
understand why women freely accede to part-time working and flexible
employment. There are obviously formidable discursive forces at work,
sustaining the devaluation of women’s financial role and reaffirming traditional models of the domestic division of labour. Indeed, the statistical


-----

Gender and modern work 99

concurrence of childcare obligations with part-time working suggests that
the configurations of circumstances that motivate female employment are
overlaid by subjective perceptions of appropriate femininity. This chapter
examines the role played by feminine subjectivity in determining the
hegemony of clock time to capitalism’s political economy of time.

No time to call our own!

It is clear that female employment patterns are configured by domestic
circumstances and the workings of the household. Within academic circles
this conception of women’s employment is advanced by two distinct
schools of feminist thought. The first is human capital theory, which has its
roots in neoclassical economics. Human capital perspectives explain female
labour market participation in terms of the functionality of family obligations (Becker 1981). Women voluntarily enter into, and out of, the
labour market in accordance with their functional position within the
family. Women’s time outside of work directly impacts on the acquisition
of human capital. These disparities in human capital translate into income
disparities and labour market segregation. Consequently, human capital
theory argues that it is women’s engagement in domestic labour which
reduces their capacity to accumulate the experience and qualifications
necessary to succeed in the labour market. To this extent, women’s time
outside of paid work is a primary determinant of inequalities in the levels of
human capital possessed by males and females. Gender inequality at work is
an outcome of women’s lack of human capital. Clear problems exists in
human capital analysis, the most significant of which is that it assumes the
existence of a perfect, gender-neutral, labour market (Walby 1990).
An alternative perspective is articulated in the reserve army of labour
approach. The idea here is that women constitute a long-term reserve of
labour that is intermittently beneficial to capital. This perspective has its
roots in Marx’s general law of capitalist accumulation. According to Marx,
as capital accumulates, it causes periodical changes which affect ‘social
capital in its totality’ (Marx, Capital, Vol. 1 [1887] 2003: 590). In certain
spheres these changes manifest in the composition of capital necessitating a
‘diminution of its variable constituent’. Elsewhere increases in the magnitude of capital require a proportionate increase in labour power. Consequently, capital accumulation ‘is always connected with violent
fluctuations and transitory production of surplus population, whether this
takes the more striking form of the repulsion of labourers already
employed, or the less evident . . . absorption of the additional labouring
population’ (2003: 591). Moreover, each historic mode of production
relies on the formation of a ‘special law of population’. In capitalist
accumulation, the existence of a reserve army functions to suppress wage
rises, which, if left unchecked, would squeeze levels of surplus value. As
capital accumulation advances, increased numbers are drawn into the


-----

100 Gender and work in capitalist economies

‘disposable industrial reserve army’, thus creating ‘a mass of human material
always ready for exploitation’ (2003: 592). Marx was little concerned to
differentiate the members of the industrial reserve army. Nevertheless,
Marx’s analysis has inspired feminist writers to argue that women’s participation in paid labour corresponds with the characteristics of a flexible
reserve army, which can be brought into the labour market and expelled,
in accordance with periodic alternations in capitalist cycles of accumulation
(Braverman 1974; Beechey 1977). Beechey has argued that married
women represent a clear example of a reserve army, because they can
periodically retreat from the labour market and, during these times, rely
upon their partner’s salary. Bruegel (1986: 49) has extended this proposition to examine the functionality of part-time work for capitalist economies. Part-time work provides capital accumulation with a surplus
population which has the capacity to correspond with capitalism’s shorter
and shorter periodic changes in its industrial cycle. As capitalist accumulation accelerates, it is subject to yearly fluctuations, monthly shifts and
even daily changes. This magnitude of indeterminacy necessitates a correspondingly flexible labour force and ‘the costs of dealing with such
fluctuations for the capitalist is less when women, particularly part-time
women have been employed’ (1986: 49). It is clearly evident that this form
of feminist analysis provides a means of contextualizing women’s work as
part of the exploitative relations of capital and labour. The reserve army
approach, however, insufficiently addresses the issue of power, control and
autonomy. Indeed, what is missing from both the human capital approach
and the reserve army perspective is an appreciation of the relationality of
power and subjectivity. The following discussion engages with the crucial
question of gender and subjectivity at work.

Employment for women

Mothering, and for that matter housework, are practices bereft of
boundaries or limits, with no clear beginning and end points, with no
guaranteed space for leisure. In housework the spaces of work and nonwork are indistinguishable, and so are the classifiable observances of timeand-motion study. Mothers do not clock in and clock off within a
delineable context of time. Tasks are the orientating boundaries of carecentred activity, hence their capacity to occupy the entire space and time
of a woman’s life. ‘A woman does not go to work, she wakes up to work.
Home is work and work is home’ (Rowbotham 1973: 71).
Mothering and housework are also, of course, unpaid. Conversely, in
the sphere of employment, time is money. It is conceived of as a quantity,
an economic variable like labour, capital and machinery, an abstract unit
infinitely divisible and free from all reference to content and context
(Adam 1993). I am obviously making reference here to the hegemony of
linear time to the productive economy. The general pervasiveness of linear


-----

Gender and modern work 101

time reflects upon our understandings of ‘free time’, in that ‘free time’ and
its correlate ‘leisure time’ are derived from commodified work time (Adam
1993). In this sense, free time accumulated through work time exists only
in relation to the time of markets and employment. Relational time
exemplifies the incompatibility of care-centred times with the prevailing
economic notion of value. The commodified time of the productive
economy is divisible into finite units, quantitatively evaluated, substituted
for money, gathered for ‘time out’ and delineated against leisure (Adam
1995: 95).
The fact that domestic labour time is exterior to the commodity system
and outside the realm of economic calculation makes it barely recognized
as work. When, for example, mothers engage in embodied relational time,
their temporal experiences are perceived, through the hegemony of linear
time, as subordinate to the commodified time of the productive economy
and denied equal value. This is despite the fact that domestic labour
constitutes a vast volume of socially necessary production essential to the
perpetuation of the capitalist economy. Nevertheless domestic labour is
constituted by capital as non-productive because it resides outside trade
relations and the marketplace. Furthermore, when mothers enter the
productive economy, their relational experiences of embodied time remain
subordinate to the hegemony of work time, thus often mitigating against
social recognition for their dual domestic and working responsibilities. And
therefore, limiting the possibility of ‘time-out’ from this double burden.
My empirical findings suggest that this situation is accentuated by the intersubjective meanings attributed to pervasive forms of female employment as
illustrated in the following transcription:

Basically he gets offended if I ask him to do something, he doesn’t like
anyone asking him to do anything. He is working on writing a paper
at the moment. A research paper. This takes up all his time and
energy, so he feels he has to have his space to do that. He also says
things like, Oh, you are better at cooking than I am . . . but I have
work that is very important to me as well. He has this very male
attitude that his work is more important than my work.

How do you feel about this?

Well, according to him, his work is more important. If other men
come round to the house, he will talk to them about his work, and
how difficult this must be and how much work he is putting into it. I
feel differently! . . . But, then, I feel the need to give him space to do
his work, because I know to him his work is important. I do resent
the extra work load I have to do, the fact that I am doing two jobs, all
the housework and I am working as well . . . his work is research at
the university, he feels that that is far more important than my work.
So I feel I have to fit round him really. I really should be more
assertive about my work but then if he gets bad-tempered, he shouts


-----

102 Gender and work in capitalist economies

at the kids and smacks the baby and I feel unhappy and I cannot
concentrate on my work, so it is far easier for me to sort the children
out and do my work . . . I don’t make a big thing about it but I do feel
that his work is valued far more than mine.

Have you any views as to why this is so?

I think that we operate at different levels. Part of the problem is that I
start to feel that my work is not as important. I don’t earn as much as
he does. So I get the feeling, I have to value my own work and give it
priority, even though he doesn’t. And I have to do it in a way that the
children don’t suffer, which is hard. I mean, I do tend to put the
children first at home, whereas he doesn’t.

Mothers at work: a ‘dual temporal burden’

Female participation in the labour market generally involves low paid,
part-time,[1] insecure employment (Dex 1984; Rubery 1994). The converse
is generally more reflective of male employment, although admittedly this
is changing (see Chapter 7). Moreover, a number of studies have found
that even where women make a substantial contribution to household
income, the importance of their earnings may be played down so that the
male is still defined as the ‘breadwinner’. Women’s wages, however
essential, are often seen as covering ‘extras’ and less often seen as challenging the earning capacity of the ‘male breadwinner’ and the concomitant value ascribed to his financial contribution to the household (Pahl
1989; Morris 1990; Brannen and Moss 1991).
With reference to working mothers, the incongruences between their
experiences of relational time and working time, coupled with their dual
domestic responsibilities and subordinate position in the productive
economy, often culminate in accentuating the demands made on their time
and further negating the possibility for ‘time-out’ and/or ‘own time’. This
is evident in the above transcript, in which the speaker’s husband’s devaluation of her paid work attends to his identification with traditionalist
discourses of domestic labour, a consequence of which is that of increasing
the female’s ascribed responsibility for child-rearing and accentuating the
relational ties between her time and the ‘needs’ of her children. For many
women, their subordinate position in the productive economy often serves
to accentuate the relational demands made on their time. It is equally
significant to recognize their employment patterns as a condition, and
consequence, of their relational experiences of time. The significance of
this latter issue to working mothers’ experiences of relational time and their
‘dual temporal burdens’ warrants its further exploration.
Working women are usually disadvantaged in the career stakes because
of their engagement in a multiplicity of simultaneous ‘need’-centred


-----

Gender and modern work 103

responsibilities and therefore they cannot always show the same amount of
commitment to paid employment as their male counterparts. It is quite
often the case for males that they manage excessive time demands at work
as a result of this labour being serviced domestically by a woman (i.e.,
partner, maid or mother). Increasing rates of formal employment by
women have meant that they are faced with the task of managing the most
demanding temporal constraints of economic labour during precisely the
same periods of their life cycle when domestic pressure is at its greatest (Le
Feuvre 1994; Deem 1996). For many women, the accumulative temporal
constraints of paid and domestic work negatively impact on their promotion opportunities and frequently result in broken or part-time
employment:

Yes, I did because once you’ve made a move into hard science, or out
of a hard science environment, it’s hard to go back. I mean, I could
never get into it now. Because if you’re out of research, for about six
months to have a baby, even if things haven’t moved on that much
really, people’s perceptions will be such that there has been some
significant advancement and thus they will be reluctant to take
somebody on who has been out of the working environment for
some time. You don’t see many women coming back into a project
or, even if they do, it is usually at a lower level . . . The friends that I
have that want to further themselves in their research, the price they
pay is that they usually don’t have kids. They may have relationships
with people who are doing research or relationships that don’t affect
their research. But they don’t have the children, although a few
people do they have nannies. And then they hardly ever see their
children and they end up feeling very guilty about this, as they don’t
spend any time with their kids. There is also the other side of the coin,
a woman at work where I am, who is basically a frustrated researcher,
is working where she is because she wanted to have kids and ends up
resenting it, because she wants to be a researcher. I think that you
have to be pragmatic about it in the end. So, yes, I did make a
conscious decision not to go into research. If the conditions were
different, I might have achieved more. But saying that, I wouldn’t
have been able to have had a family as well.
(full-time lecturer, married, two children)

Working mothers consistently experience pressure from almost every
sphere of their lives. Many have to reconcile subjective feelings of guilt
with the financial necessity of paid employment and also the satisfactions
that working might bring. Significantly, my attention has been drawn to
yet another media-exaggerated academic study, widely circulated in the
popular press (possibly because it coincides with concerns over school
discipline), suggesting direct correlations between a mother’s participation
in paid employment and maladjusted children (BBC News 2003). For
many women, social pressures deriving from this, and similar discourses of


-----

104 Gender and work in capitalist economies

‘maternal deprivation’, exist in conjunction with temporal conflicts,
grounded in linear time, between work and home. More often than not,
mothers find that they cannot afford to spend extra hours doing overtime,
attending union meetings or other work-related activities. One should also
consider the pressures employers place on female employers to convince
them that their loyalties and priorities reside at work and not at home
(Wearing 1984). For many women, the culmination of these social pressures is expressed in terms of their opting for part-time work or less
temporally demanding full-time employment. It is for these, and other
reasons (e.g., the reproduction of gender segregation in paid employment,
see, for example, Kerfoot and Knights 1993) that women are generally
disproportionately represented in the subordinate ranks of organizations.
While many women tailor their working patterns around their domestic
commitments in an attempt to reduce their dual burden, my empirical
findings suggest that this often has the unintended consequences of
increasing the demands made on their time. In that their disproportionate
representation in the lower ranks of organizations often encourages
experiences of ‘temporal disempowerment’ in relation to their superiors, as
evident in the following transcription:

The job that I’m doing at the moment in NEAB, I don’t think I’m
getting paid enough, for what I’m doing. But that’s just how it goes
. . . You find that most of the low paid people at the NEAB do the
most work, mind you, that’s the way it is in most walks of life, isn’t it?

Could you expand a bit more on how it is at work?

Well, it is just that because you work on a switchboard people might
say to me, what day will the exam results be sent out? I know what
day the exam results are to be sent out but I haven’t the time to tell
them, so I put it on to the general office. And they will tell them, they
will have the time. I mean, I would just say, oh, it is going to be the
26th of August. And they might say, well are you sure about that? I
have to be 100 per cent sure about it because you’re talking about
exams. Working in that sort of environment, it is not how I think it
has got to be accurate. Because I don’t have the time . . . I have gone
through this with ***[name of husband], he says, why don’t you have
the time? And I say because we don’t have the time. I have a
supervisor she is quite nice although very extreme. She is the kind of
woman who is constantly saying, ‘Come on answer the phone.’ And I
feel like saying to her ‘Why don’t you answer the phone?’ She seems
to spend all day telling people to answer the phone, she doesn’t seem
to do anything else but that . . . I’m always arguing with her. You
can’t treat people like that, you can’t just get rid of a call that quickly.
Oh, yes, you can, you have got the time [referring to a conversation
with her supervisor]. We are not allowed to take messages either. So

Gender and modern work 105

really it’s funny in a way, because at the end of the day, I just laugh
sometimes, because I think, oh, well, you’re getting paid for it.
(full-time receptionist, married, one child)

The transcript eloquently illustrates the ‘temporal disempowerment’ often
experienced by those occupying the subordinate ranks of organizations.
The respondent makes several references to superordinates (i.e., those
occupying the general office and her supervisor) whom she perceives as
having more time than she. In so doing, she appears to be aware of a form
of ‘temporal hierarchy’ of personal times within her working environment.
It would appear, in this instance, and for working environments in general,
that the organization of the workplace reflects and reinforces a hierarchy of
time control; that is, the time of subordinates is largely controlled by
superiors (the latter often have ‘gatekeepers’ to protect them from the
pressures of others’ time demands). Since women are disproportionately
represented in the subordinate ranks of organizations, their time is more
likely to be regulated by others than by themselves. Following on from the
theme of this subsection, the disproportionate representation of working
mothers in the subordinate ranks of organizations, has as its condition the
effect of increasing the demands made on their time, i.e., their relational
experiences of time grounded in their ‘need’-centred relation to their
infants coexist with experiences of temporal disempowerment consequent
of their (often) subordinate position in the ranks of organizations. It is in
this sense that working mothers often experience a dual temporal burden.
My approach to analysing the dual temporal burden of working mothers
attempts to render problematic the recourse to dualistic divisions of public
and private. Rather experiences of relational time ‘weave’ complex patterns through every aspect of the individual’s life, intertwining the public
and private into an embodied existence with the world (Davies 1990).

Gendered time power/knowledge and resistance

A central aim of the discussion so far has been to identify how women’s
ascribed domestic role in the private sphere, and subordinate position in
the public sphere, encourage a disproportionate experience of relational
time by female subjects. But this is not to assume that these temporal
demands are beyond negotiation and resistance. A consistent theme
throughout this chapter has been that of identifying the inextricable
associations between relational time and power/knowledge. Relational
perceptions of time are constructed through sociohistorical discourses.
These discourses are informed by culturally specific knowledges which
emerge through discursive struggles and compete among each other for
pre-eminence, as illustrated in the discussion of the discursive constructs of
motherhood. An unintended consequence of the pre-eminence of these
knowledge claims is that of marginalizing and/or subjugating alternative


-----

106 Gender and work in capitalist economies

knowledges emanating from, for example, feminist writings or discourses
on sexuality (Butler 1990; Clough 1994). It is these marginalized or subjugated knowledges that offer a point of resistance to dominant masculine,
linear conceptions of time. Of course, resistance cannot assure the dissipation of dominant knowledges, and indeed resistance has the curious
affect of accentuating focus around a particular power configuration whose
‘existence depends on a multiplicity of points of resistance’ (Foucault
1979b:95). In this sense, resistance can ‘play the role of adversary, target,
support, or handle in power relations’ (1979b:95). Thus the relationality of
power is constituted by a complex matrix ‘that passes through apparatuses
and institutions, without being exactly localised in them, so too the swarm
of points of resistance traverses social stratifications and individual unities’
(1979b:96). Consequently, ‘the relationship between power and freedom’s
refusal to submit cannot be separated’ (1982: 221). Located at the heart of
‘the power relationship, and constantly provoking it, are the recalcitrance
of the will and the intransigence of freedom’ (1982: 221–2). While power
relationships have the propensity to induce periods of stability, they are also
inherently unstable: ‘Every power relationship implies at least in potentia, a
strategy of struggle’ and the possibility of reversal (1982: 225). With specific reference to gender relations, feminist discourses provide a concrete
challenge to androcentristic knowledges. So, for example, women’s
movements, the feminist press, feminist academic and even women’s
magazines, can circulate the foundations for alternative discourses that
inspire resistance to dominant gender relations of power/knowledge.
Alternative ways of negotiating the domestic division of labour, for
example, bring into question the gendered status of these responsibilities in
ways that could facilitate a substantial challenge to gendered divisions in the
salaried labour market (e.g., job segregation, unequal pay, etc.). Consequently, the relational demands made on women’s time are, at least in
principal, open to negotiation, resistance and contestation.
Moreover, my empirical research findings suggest that women do not
consistently and uniformly acquiesce to the relational demands made on
their time. Rather, it is evident that women often adopt complex strategies
and modes of negotiation in an attempt to gain some autonomy within the
constraining nexus of relational demands made on them and their time. For
example, the full-time voluntary worker, quoted earlier, described how she
copes with the demands made of her at work and at home:

I home in, and I say, right, I’m doing this now, and I try and block
out the other things. I think, well, I can’t do it all and I just have to
miniaturize. It becomes like one thing after another and instead of
having a wider perspective, I have to have a very narrow perspective
in that I must deal with these phone calls one after another. I must get
the books done. I must, you know, one thing after another and I have
to simplify everything and I feel like it’s narrowing.
(full-time paid voluntary worker, married, two children)


-----

Gender and modern work 107

The coping strategy is interesting for several reasons. At one level of
analysis, it is illustrative of the potential for resistance to the demands made
on her time. She tries to accumulate space and time by narrowing the
boundaries of her work routines. Each operation is fragmented into distinct
and separate tasks. Assuming that she is successful in this endeavour, then
the entirety of obligations will be represented within a manageable context.
But complex forces curtail such strategies, as women’s work can ‘never be a
normal job routine because emotion erupts in its midst’ (Rowbotham
1973: 73). Further discussion of women’s work and emotional labour is
provided in Chapter 7. What is of significance, here, is the respondent’s
method of compartmentalizing her actions. Such coping strategies appear
resonant with the discursive constructs of linear time. It is as though the
respondent’s strategy for coping with the multiple and simultaneous
demands made on her time involve adopting actions which reflect and
reproduce the purposive instrumentalism discursively associated with
masculinity. This might be explained by the observation that ‘masculinity is
neither exclusive to men nor exhaustive of their discursive being’ (Kerfoot
and Knights 1996: 80). But it would appear that the respondent’s action is
indicative of the necessity for organizational members to adopt masculine
enterprise as a coping strategy. Even though this may require the denial of a
more conventional feminine identity, life experience and social relations.
For individuals caught up in feminine discourses, their relational
experiences of time and cries for ‘time out’ often find little expression
unless reinscribed into the rational instrumentalism and disembodied
existence of linear time. With specific reference to the working environment, although the respondents, in my empirical research, described
numerous strategies of ‘temporal negotiation’ (e.g., extended coffee and
lunch breaks, and ‘appropriately timed’ flexi-leave), freedom to negotiate
time schedules generally varied significantly according to the individuals’
position within an organizational hierarchy. So, for example, less senior
staff were more constrained in terms of time discretion when compared to
their senior colleagues. This is not to presume a less intense time commitment for more senior female members of staff. Many of the female
managers and senior personnel, that I interviewed, spoke of having to put
in longer hours, as it were, to continuously justify and maintain their status
vis-a`-vis their male counterparts and colleagues. These longer hours and
extra work duties were often combined with the equally, if not more
intense, domestic demands made on these women within the home. I
therefore suggest that feminine conceptions of time as relational, while
open to resistance, tend to prevail among women by virtue of a dominant
and comparatively impermeable gendered employment segregation and
sexual division labour, both in formal employment and in the home.

108 Gender and work in capitalist economies

Timely reflections

Capitalist accumulation is premised on the rational ordering and control of
space and time, and the denial of diffe´rance, ‘a refusal to accept limits and the
insistence on continually reaching out . . . [to] a destiny that is always
beyond; beyond morality, beyond tragedy, beyond culture’ (Bell 1976:
50). Consequently, the rationalization of time in capitalist accumulation
presupposes a ‘metaphysics of presence’ in which a substance is assumed to
have a meaning in and of itself and can be present to a knowing disembodied subject. This metaphysics of presence is resonant with the
structural organization of modern Western language. Derrida (1997) argues
that Western metaphysics is perpetually animated by the presumption that
true meaning is inherent in the spoken address. This assumes that both the
word (signifier) and the meaning (signified) are directly present at the
instance of a speech act. So, for example, the concept of clock time presupposes a metaphysics of presence, which invokes a universal meaning
that is consistent irrespective of the immediate context. Thus, we are led to
believe that a unit of work time has the same value irrespective of the
biography and gender of the worker. Such is the hegemony of clock time
to the productive economy that we fail to recognize that ‘Without a
retention in the minimal unit of temporal experience, without a trace
retaining the other as other in the same, no difference would do its work
and no meaning would appear’ (1997: 62). Consequently, the metaphysics
of presence, that is, clock time, ‘carries in itself the destiny of its nonsatisfaction’ (1997: 143). From the instance that representation ‘claims to be
presence and the sign of the thing itself’ it denies the binary operation of
the sign and the ‘vicariousness of its own function’ (1997: 144). This is
because the self-evident presence of meaning is accomplished through a
binary opposition between what is present and what is absent or denied.
This conception of ‘being as presence’ (Heidegger 2006) reduces the
innumerability of appearances by making them apprehensible to a sovereign phallocentric consciousness (Hekman 1990). ‘Being as presence’ is
therefore a project of mastery, i.e., an attempt to obliterate the origin of
absence. This kind of circumspection has inspired me to link the clock time
of modern work with masculine legislative reason. Following Derrida, it is
claimed here that the desire for a metaphysics of presence in rationalist
discourses of time consists in a repression of the feminine to an absent
Other. But the feminine is a ‘dangerous supplement’ to the presence of
linear clock time. This is because ‘difference produces what it forbids,
makes possible the very thing that it makes impossible’ (Derrida 1997:
143).
Despite its hegemony, representational clock time is struggling to
contain radical challenges to the sovereignty of its Cartesian subject, its
rational ordering of time and space and its subversion of diffe´rance (Ermarth
1992). Emerging through and contributing to fractures and fissures in the
hegemony of representational time is a vibrant feminist tradition which


-----

Gender and modern work 109

radically challenges linear time’s claim to neutrality. Linear time as a masculine project, seeking to control the future, is oblivious of any other (e.g.,
feminine) conception of time. Its claim to neutrality therefore arises by
default. It knows no Other. In contrast to the representational assumption
which claims linear time to have meaning in and of itself, these feminist
discourses draw attention to linear time as grounded in gendered power
relations. For example, Davies (1990, 1994), and Leccardi (1996) have
variously argued that men and women use time differently due to their
distinct life situation. The routinized circularity and repetitiveness of
domestic labour encapsulated by the phrase ‘a woman’s work is never done’
are identified as exemplifying the incompatibility of women’s work with
linear conceptions of time (Davies 1990; Le Feuvre 1994). Rarely in the
domestic sphere can time be conceived of as quantitatively delineated units
that are readily differentiated between, for example, work and leisure or
personal time (Adam 1993: 172). These literatures variously identify
‘women’s time’ as continuous. Here the temporal density and complexity of
‘women’s roles’ displace any sense of ‘time out’ (Davies 1990). Moreover, as
Chambers (1986) argues, ‘women’s perception of time are historically
constructed within a domestic ideology in which time not spent in paid
employment is used for unpaid domestic duties’. Consequently ‘time out’, or
‘free time’ is impossible or translated into other ‘self-sacrificing activities’. In
sum, this broad feminist critique attempts to illuminate the incompatibility of
‘women’s time’ with a linear perspective which separates work from leisure,
the public from private, and task- from clock-based orientations to time.
While feminist suggestions of distinct male and female times draw our
attention to the significance of gender to the discursive construction of
linear time, their dualistic suppositions need to be treated with immense
caution. By transforming what are merely heuristic categories into reified
ontological realities, these feminist discourses attend to representational
epistemologies and in so doing, often unintentionally, reinforce the
hegemony of linear time. For their male/female temporal oppositions (or
even feminine time/masculine time dualisms, which assume each element
to have a calcified existence in the world) partake of a tradition which
constitutes the feminine as Other to the masculine order. Moreover,
feminist discourses which valorize female time as that which counters male
time compound the phallocentricity of dualistic representation. The theme
here is directly relevant to an idea expressed by Derrida (1979) in which he
equates the quest for truth with the pursuit of mastery and assigns this with
the signifier masculine. Conversely, feminine identity ‘takes so little
interest in truth, because in fact she barely even believes in it, the truth . . .
For it is the man who believes in the truth of woman, in woman truth’
(1979: 63). Consequently, the woman who pursues absolute truth merely
succeeds in mimicking the fallacies and contradictions of logocentricism. In
so doing, ‘in truth, they too are men’ (1979: 65). Thus ‘and in order to
resemble the masculine dogmatic philosopher this woman lays claim – just
as much claim as he – to truth, science and objectivity in all their castrated


-----

110 Gender and work in capitalist economies

delusions of virility’ (1979:65). In this sense, feminist discourses which
invert the dualistic oppositions through which linear time is constructed,
are unintentionally reproducing the hegemony of linear time and in doing
so marginalizing their alternative discourse. Leccardi (1996: 171), for
example, identifies women’s time as expressive of a ‘female rationality’.
Starting from the premise that rationality has been conceived as transcendence of the feminine and that women cannot easily be accommodated
into a cultural ideal which has defined itself in opposition to all that is
feminine, several feminist writers (Lloyd 1984) have argued that the ideal
of a sexually neutral reason is radically misconceived. Moreover, these
feminist writers have variously drawn our attention to the feminine as itself
partly constituted by its occurrence within rationalist thought. Acknowledging this, one might argue that Leccardi’s conceptualization of women’s
time, and her identification of this time as motivated by a distinctive kind
of rational order, have been partly formed within the philosophical tradition to which it may appear to be a reaction. More specifically, the effort
to valorize women’s time as an essentially different kind of rationality and
agency unrecognized by masculine rationalism ‘will occur in a space
already prepared for it by the intellectual tradition it seeks to reject’ (Lloyd
1984: 104). One can only assume, therefore, that no dualistic theory – not
even one which measures its adequacy in terms of justice to the complexities of ‘female temporal experience’ – can place itself beyond the
danger of reproducing the very Same conditions to which it is Other.
Conversely, it is suggested here that to avoid this reproduction of the
very discourse that feminism seeks to destroy, it is necessary not to invert,
but to deconstruct the masculine/feminine opposition. Deconstruction as
defined by Derrida (1984: 329) is a strategy which attacks the classical
oppositions of the metaphysics of presence and in so doing undermines the
phallocentric binary system that is its condition and consequence. As
Derrida puts it, ‘Deconstruction cannot limit itself or proceed immediately
to a neutralization: it must, by means of a double gesture, a double science,
a double writing, practice an overturning of the classical opposition and a
general displacement of the system’ (1984: 329). Deconstruction achieves
this by intervening in and or violating the exclusions of ‘logocentric closure’, refusing to accept an elevation of the present over the absent. My
alternative discourse of gendered time is premised on the discursive constitution of gender identities. There is no metaphysical conception of
gender and time which has meaning in and of itself. There is no reified,
unitary, rational subject. There is no essential self, which transcends culture
and language. ‘Deconstruction does not consist in passing from one concept to another, but in overturning and displacing a conceptual order, as
well as the nonconceptual order with which the conceptual order it
articulated’ (1984: 329). Our own experience as women cannot be taken as
an unproblematic starting point for feminist theory, because that experience has neither an essential nor a consistent meaning. For subjectivity,
constituted in and through a multiplicity of (often contradictory) discursive


-----

Gender and modern work 111

positions, is unsystematic and always in process. To this extent ‘subjectivity
is at once both contingent and precarious’ (Kerfoot and Knights 1996: 86).
Gender identities are, therefore, inherently unstable and continually selfdeconstructing. ‘For if the subject is constituted by power, that power does
not cease at the moment the subject is constituted, for that subject is never
fully constituted, but is subjected and produced time and again’ (Butler
1992: 13). The subject is neither a foundation nor a fixed immutable
product, but rather the ‘permanent possibility’ of certain ‘resignifying’
processes (1992: 13). In this sense, the meaning of gender is interminably
deferred and endlessly multiple.
While it is axiomatic that what counts as masculine or feminine identity
is multilayered, and may shift over the lifetime of individuals, it is possible
to recognize their current manifestations. Primarily informed by my
empirical research, this chapter has argued that those whose identities are
discursively constituted as feminine invariably derive meaningful existence,
purpose and direction through an embeddedness in embodied social
relationships. The centrality ascribed to others by those caught up in
feminine discourses encourages a perception of time that exists in relation
to significant others. Feminine time and masculine time are constituted
through complementary processes of inclusion and exclusion. For example,
Chapter 4 described masculine linear time as embodying high levels of
instrumental rationality. This form of rationality was in turn identified as
constructed through a denial, displacement and/or denigration of what is
generally accepted to be feminine characteristics.
In conclusion, Chapters 4 and 5 have sought to challenge discourses of
gendered time that conceptualize this phenomenon as ‘existing’ through
the opposition of an absolute polarity between male and female. The
alternative discourse proposed here is an interval that endeavours to originate not a theory of knowledge, in the sense of a replacement of
Enlightenment reason, but rather to apprehend the inter-subjective relations by, which gendered subjects ascribe meaning to their life worlds. In
keeping with this proposition, my alternative discourse of gendered time
depicts masculine and feminine times as elements that represent multiple
differences, pluralities of characteristics that cross and recross the alleged
boundary between the two. It is a discourse that recognizes gender identity
as inherently unstable and continually self-deconstructing. In this discourse
the meaning of gender identity is constantly deferred, eternally multifarious
a narrative archetype of perpetual textual reverie and yet one that does not
eradicate either the masculine or feminine self. It is in this sense that
discourses, of gendered time can fracture the masculine fiction of unity that
is the rationalization of clock time in modern work and reveal how this
metaphysics of presence depends on the repression of an Other.

Timely reflections on self, subjectivity and technological
determinism

Within academic circles and in the media, call centres have often been
described in distinctly Orwellian terms. In these ‘white-collar factories’
hundreds of employees are arranged in serried ranks to handle a seemingly
endless flow of customer telephone inquiries. The new generation of
monitoring technology is extremely powerful. It can analyse ‘keystrokes’
on terminals to determine whether employees are making efficient use of
their time between telephone conversations. Employers can tap phones,
read emails and monitor computer screens. The possibility, and in some
cases the coercive use, of surveillance techniques for call centre personnel
are dramatic, intense and secretive. This surveillance can involve not only a
constant measurement of performance but also other pressures associated
with the intensification of work.
As a result of this mechanistic division of labour, there has been a
tendency to see call centres as a contemporary version of the nineteenthcentury sweatshop or those Dickensian ‘dark, satanic mills’ (Apostol 1996;
Garrod 1996). Theoretical support for the ‘sweatshop’ view of call centres
and similar IT-intensive workplaces has, in part, come from an increasing
use of a deterministic Foucauldian perspective on discipline at work
(Sewell and Wilkinson 1992; Arkin 1997; Fernie and Metcalf 1997).
Incessant dedication to electronic performance monitoring and ubiquitous
accumulation of coded information are described as typifying disciplinary
modes of regulating activities in time–space (Sewell and Wilkinson 1992).
But there is a tendency in these accounts to read Foucault’s conception of
subjectivity ‘as a product of controlling and dominating social bonds . . . of


-----

116 Gender and work in capitalist economies

the person as simply responding to disciplinary power’ (Ezzy 1997: 428). In
short, this use of Foucault fails to recognize the distinction between subjects being constituted through rather than by a variety of disciplinary
technologies that reinforce and reproduce existing inequalities at work and
within wider society more broadly (Knights and McCabe 1998a, 2001).
Conversely, our research has been more sanguine concerning the realistic,
as opposed to the theoretical, potential of using technology to control
employees in this fashion. Employers’ dependence on emotional labour
(Hochschild 1983) and the social skills of their call centre staff to ensure
high levels of customer service, means that the employee relationship has to
be managed extremely carefully (Frenkel et al. 1998; Taylor and Bain
1998).
The ethnographic research presented in this chapter was conducted in a
UK financial services call centre that historically had seemed to switch back
and forth between ‘hard’ performance-driven and ‘soft’ service qualitybased, management strategies. When the research began in February 1997,
management stressed the quality of service encounters, and thereby within
that framework, allowed staff considerable time and space to perform their
jobs as they thought fit. This ‘process’ style of management had been in
existence for five or six years, having partially replaced earlier quantitative
‘task’-oriented concerns with productivity. By the end of the research in
October 1998, a rekindling of the anxiety about productivity levels
resulted in a demand for a stricter timing of calls and performance measurement. As we shall see, this created tensions, not least because it conflicted with quality management initiatives, that had recently been
introduced but, more importantly, it violated the levels of service quality
with which staff had begun to identify. Consequently, the performance
programmes, which seek to increase productivity through decreasing call
handling and abandonment rates, were met with a mixed reception,
ranging from resistance through to reluctant accommodation. The close
attachment to service quality had arisen, partly despite management, largely
because of an identification with customers that could be seen as a response
of staff to a situation that otherwise might have little to offer except a
monotonous routine and increasing levels of work intensification. But staff
had another tool in their armoury of resistance to a coercive or heavyhanded system of management control, and this was the company brand. If
calls had constantly to be terminated abruptly because of standard times,
what might this do for the brand reputation that had taken years to
establish? There was not militant resistance to the intensification of time
discipline because, like all call centre staff, they were used to the pressure to
keep call waiting times down and the electronic call boards were a constant
reminder of this obligation both to customers and colleagues. Also given
the importance of meaningful projects to the securing of a solid sense of
identity, it is not surprising to find self-disciplined individuals transforming
themselves into time-disciplined corporate subjects. What is surprising is
the failure of some academic literatures to recognize this aspect of


-----

Post-Fordist production: the call centre 117

Foucault’s (1979a) analysis of disciplinary technology and, perhaps more
importantly, the subtle forms of resistance that often ensue.
The chapter is structured as follows. The first section provides a brief
overview of the literature on call centres in so far as this has implications for
work intensification and time/space discipline in the labour process. Second, the ethnography of the call centre and several key analytic themes
emergent from the ethnography are defined and discussed in relation to
concepts, issues and topics in the literature. Finally, some concluding
reflections are offered on how the chapter contributes to the development
of workplace analyses of call centres.

Time discipline at work

In recent years, several literatures have sought to challenge the prevalence
of linear discourses of time to organizational analysis. Hassard (1989) and
Clark (1985), for example, have drawn attention to the limitations of
treating time as exclusively homogenous and quantitative and the pluraltemporality of organizational life. As Clark (1985: 6) puts it, ‘ ‘‘the central
time problem’’ for organizational sociology is to penetrate behind the
metaphor of clock-time, because existing approaches to the ‘‘time
dimension’’ rely totally on ‘‘clock-time’’ ’. Whipp in his review of Clark’s
contribution to organizational analysis, describes the way in which Clark
shows ‘how contrasting industries lead organizations to develop ‘‘repertoires’’ of rules, structures and forms of action to meet the varying rhythms
of demand, competition and regulation’ (1994: 103). Such rules rely upon
everyday commonsense knowledge (Schutz 1967) but, nonetheless, are a
vital means of accounting for and coping with the negotiated timetables of
organizational life. Whipp (1994: 103) draws upon the notion of temporal
repertoires in his work on time and management, stating that ‘the notion of
structural and temporal repertoires is based on the recursiveness of the
irregular, sometimes cyclical, event-based trajectories of the firm’. This
reading of temporality recognizes the extent to which subjectivity is a
reflexive, fluid and often precarious process instantiated through the time/
space events, which it also serves to constitute (Mouffe 1992: 372). In this
sense, ‘governable spaces are not fabricated counter to experience; they
make new kinds of experience possible, produce new modes of perception,
invest percepts with affects, with dangers and opportunities, with saliences
and attractions’ (Rose 1999: 32). Our work extends this Foucauldian–
inspired proposition by identifying how call centre staff secure a sense of
their own subjectivity and identity through the incessant codification and
material organization of conduct in time and space.

The ethnography of the BNFS call centre

The ethnographic case study took place in the call centre of a major retail
financial services company, whose brand name and reputation were wellestablished. For purposes of confidentiality, the company is given the
pseudonym – Brand Name Financial Services (BNFS). The research was
focused on the telephone service encounter although various departments
were investigated on a systematic basis. The main departments were customer service, including resource and support, credit services, new business
and life and pensions/savings and investment. The research took place and
involved intensive fieldwork and feedback meetings with the company’s
management and staff (Knights, Calvey and Odih 1998, Knights, Calvey
and Odih 1999). The methodology adopted combines ‘critical ethnography’ (Wainwright 1997) with ‘organization ethnography’ (Bate 1997)
thus synthesizing a focus on the meanings and definitions of organizational
members with a critical examination of the historical and organizational
context of their production and reproduction. Our research methods were
comprised of conversational analysis of tape-recorded service encounter
interactions, observational techniques, discourse analysis on organizational
documents and unstructured interviews. Telephone customer advisers, in
BNFS, work in teams of eight with a senior adviser and a team manager.
Typically an adviser will simultaneously be doing screen work and scripted
call work with the customer while at the desk on a set of headphones. The
average numbers of calls per hour is 26 and time spent on the phone is 80
per cent of the working day. The abandonment rate (i.e., calls not taken to
a successful conclusion), the reduction of which is highly prioritized, is 7
per cent. The centre is open 8a.m. until 8p.m. with a mix of full- and parttime staff doing various 8-hour shifts. To coin a phrase, it is ‘all day,
everyday’ (Westwood 1976).

Analytic themes, data and discussion

The shift away from a ‘task’-oriented focus on productivity towards a more
‘process’ concern with the quality of service encounters, had occurred just
prior to our arrival to conduct empirical research in BNFS. Characteristic
of the ‘hard’ aspects of quality management (Hill 1991), the previous ‘task’oriented culture was predominantly concerned with statistical monitoring
and performance measurement standards. Recognizing that statistical
measurements take place within a social context, where their human
interpretation remains paramount, the process approach seeks to complement quantitative calculations of performance with qualitative support for
staff to improve customer service.
A series of structural changes (e.g., emergence of team managers),
initiatives and strategies (e.g., tape reviews, team talks, Quality Assurance,
etc.) dedicated to quality resulted from the development of a more


-----

Post-Fordist production: the call centre 119

‘process’-oriented culture. The following transcript excerpt provides for a
partial insight into the impact of this approach on the service encounter:

Those techniques are actually trained to actually help the adviser deal
with the calls. Not, that is, not necessarily trained in terms of high call
volume, it is overall in terms of telephone techniques in order to help
the adviser. When the calls are queuing, we don’t say, you better
hurry up, because that is not what we are about, we are about customer service and however much that customer requires our attention, we hope that we can give it. The call control training just helps
them . . . but by no means is it associated with when 23 calls are
queuing then you use the speed-up process, that’s not what it is about
at all.
(trainer)

Partly as a result of this training, but perhaps also because of the relational
conceptions of time held by the staff, customer service was a deeply
embedded value that strongly defined the meanings, reality and sense of
self-identity of customer advisers. Characteristic of the ‘soft’ aspects of
quality management (Hill 1991), this ‘process’ orientation has, as its main
concern, that of gearing every activity and member of the organization
towards serving the final customer. Activities performed within the
organization are reconstituted into interlinking segments of a ‘quality
chain’. Through quality initiatives, every level of the organization right
down to the appraisal of individual members of staff, reflects and reinforces
the corporate desire for excellent, quality service. The necessary levels of
commitment and quality performance, needed to sustain the desire for
excellence, are achieved through a process-centred training programme.

Process time and ‘emotional labour’

It is significant that the call centre is staffed predominantly by young
women although BNFS has begun to see the benefit of recruiting more
mature women, especially because of their potential to assume informal
leadership roles in teamworking (Kerfoot and Knights 1996). This gender
division of labour conforms to a well-established tradition of service
industry employment. However, it could be argued that women’s
experience of surviving in a male-dominated and often macho culture has
meant that they have acquired social skills that prove highly effective in
service and sales encounters (Hochschild 1983). One particular skill that
was heavily emphasized by training and personnel managers was ‘empathy’.
The concept of ‘empathy’ is eloquently expressed in the following excerpt:

[Empathy] which is all about looking at you and the customer’s
relationship, [and asking] what else can we do for the customer? So it
is going beyond APTUS (consultant techniques of how to handle the
customer, how to control, how to keep the customer informed). It


-----

120 Gender and work in capitalist economies

was looking at, OK, you have got the customer on the line. You have
got your techniques, your telephone procedures but what else can we
do to exceed their expectation with BNFS so that they will always
remember us, with, yes, BNFS have always provided me with an
excellent customer service.
(trainer)

‘Emotional labour’ is an integral feature of achieving empathy. Following
Hochschild (1983: 7) we define emotional labour to mean ‘the management of feeling to create a publicly observable facial and bodily display’. It
is our contention that empathy’s emotional labour encourages a ‘processorientation’ where:

time is enmeshed in social relations. Several processes may intertwine
simultaneously and the fabric of life is patterned by the multiple crisscrossing chains of processes. In some cases, schedules and clock time
may have structured the activity originally but unexpected exigencies
frequently call for the abandonment of a clock-time relationship and
bring process time to the fore instead.
(Davies 1994: 280)

This involves a more flexible relation to time where ‘the task itself defines
the amount of time to be consumed, rather than a time limit or temporal
demarcation being placed on the task’ (Davies 1990: 37). These literatures
provide for highly insightful attempts to deconstruct dominant understanding(s) of time (see especially Davies 1990 and Leccardi 1996) through,
for example, drawing our attention to ‘women’s time’ as embodied in daily
life (Davies 1990). While feminist suggestions of distinct ‘male/linear’ and
‘female/process’ times draw our attention to the significance of gender in
the discursive constitution of time, their insufficient theorization of power
and subjectivity has the unintended consequence of reproducing the very
phallogocentric discourse (Irigaray 1980) that feminism seeks to challenge.
Conversely, primarily informed by the writings of Foucault, the discourse
of gendered time, expressed here, has as its premise a conceptualization of
power and subjectivity as grounded in the exercise of power through social
practices in which subjects are embedded. Subjectivity is constituted
through the exercise of power within which conceptions of personal
identity come to be generated. To quote Kerfoot and Knights (1994: 70):

Where subjectivity is constituted in and through discourse, the gender
identity of men and women as masculine and feminine subjects is
socially constituted in and through certain sites, behaviours and
practices at any one time.

Gender identities are, in this sense, historically contingent, unstable and
potentially multiple. This notion of the discursive production of gendered
subjects within and between power relations provides a means of reconciling the ‘women’s time’/linear dualism inherent in feminist discourses of


-----

Post-Fordist production: the call centre 121

gendered time (see chapter five). Instead of polarizing the masculine and
feminine conceptions of time along the lines of biological/social gender,
we conceptualize ‘feminine’ time as discursively constituted as ‘feminine’
through particular identities but not in such a way as to be exclusive to, or
exhaustive of, the lives of women. The dualistic opposition between an
essential ‘female time’ and equally essential ‘male/linear time’, evident in
feminist discourses of gendered time, is dissolved by a recognition of the
discursive constitution of gender identities and their potential multiplicity.
However, the materialism of modern existence and the social practices that
flow from it reflect and reinforce expressions of time grounded in the
hegemony of commodified, economically valued, individualistic, linear
time (Odih 1998). Game (1991: 26) describes how ‘a conception of time as
homogenous and empty, or abstract is associated with a desire for identity
and a whole, a desire to know what the social is in its totality’. For it is only
when time is conceived of as homogenous can it be held still in order that
the ‘whole’ can be revealed to the ‘objective’ observer (1991: 26).
Linear discourses of time, therefore, reflect and reproduce conceptualizations of the social world which seek to represent the world as an
intelligible whole, rendering it readily manipulable for instrumental purposes. Clear parallels exist between this instrumental manner of relating to
the world and ‘masculine’ ways of being. Writers have variously identified
contemporary discourses of masculinity as discursively bound up with an
estrangement and disembodiment from the particularity of human existence (Seidler 1989). Kerfoot and Knights (1996: 86) describe this form of
masculinity as ‘abstract and highly instrumental with respect to controlling
its objects, thus sustaining a mode of relating to externalities that is selfestranged and wholly disembodied’. Linear time by definition involves a
kind of transcendence that trivializes the specificity of the finite moment. It
requires a kind of estrangement from the present that entails dematerialization, abstraction and disembodiment (Ermarth 1992). In the writings
of Foucault (1979a, 1982) we come to recognize the inextricable links
between subjectification and linear conceptions of time. Discipline and
Punish (Foucault 1979a) is replete with references to subjectification as
necessitating the ‘control’ of time/space in strategies such as the separation
of individuals, the homogenization of physical being, activity and the
installation of permanent and intensive forms of surveillance.
Returning to our case study, masculine preoccupations with control and
conquest are routinely reproduced by task-oriented demands for quantitative results in improved performance, productivity and profitability. An
incessant dedication to electronic performance monitoring and ubiquitous
accumulation of coded information typifies masculine preoccupations with
transforming everything and everyone into an object of control and conquest (Kerfoot and Knights 1996).
The introduction of processual working practices implied a challenge,
discontinuity and/or disruption of the hegemonic linear rationalities
associated with task-oriented production. Process time is both a condition

122 Gender and work in capitalist economies

and consequence of specific management practices, geared towards the
achievement of ‘empathy’ with consumers. Accountability and selfdiscipline are central to the production of ‘empathy’. But the demand for
empathy means that adviser–customer relations and interactions, rather
than productivity performance measures, are more likely to condition the
time that is spent in service or sales encounters. This generates some
tensions, if not contradictions, in the management of call centre staff.

Task and process tensions

The organization’s task orientation and its process orientation, are productive of two specific modes of relating to the duration of the call. The
task orientation assumes the call to occur within a predefined amount of
time (i.e., a 200 seconds average handling time). The duration of the call in
this sense is a specified quantity, an abstract singular unit, homogenous
though divisible into discrete elements (i.e., 200 seconds). According to
this task orientation, the duration of the call translates directly into money;
it is a commodity – a resource that can be used to co-ordinate activities.
But this task-oriented perception of the duration of the call is deployed
without reference to content or context. It is unable to recognize that
empathy is a relational quality and not a numeric quantity.
By contrast, the process orientation has no predefined perception of the
duration of the call. The service encounter/call itself defines the amount of
time to be consumed rather than a time limit or temporal demarcation
being placed on it. For the customer advisers, a process orientation to the
service encounter facilitates a holistic comprehension of their role and its
significance to the organization as a whole. Furthermore, a process
orientation can ameliorate some of the repetitive monotony of telephone
work, the separation of employees from one another, and the routinized
processing of abstract or depersonalized pieces of data or information. The
benefits and advantages of a process orientation to the service encounter
are expressed in the following transcript:

I think that the only way that I can get overall satisfaction is to really
know that I have done the job properly. In a way you become a
robot. You do generally, I’m not saying that I achieve it every time.
You do have to feel that you have done that right and that you have
done everything that you possibly can. It is the only way that you get
satisfaction. Otherwise it does get very, very repetitive. And even
sorting out queries, you know, if there is an ongoing thing. To sort of
trace it up. I quite like doing that. Usually it is quite nice to have to
see where it leads. To come in on Monday morning it is quite nice to
start that off.

Post-Fordist production: the call centre 123

While customer advisers are trained to be processual in relation to the
service encounter and prioritize the needs of the customer, this often runs
up against the task-related pressures of call volume. As the following
excerpt makes clear, the conflict between call volume and quality of service
present a continuous dilemma:

[T]here is in the fact that if they do follow something through and it is
something which is a little bit unusual, then we say keep a note of it so
when you go for your review to the team manager, they are aware
that you are taking customer service a step further . . . But timewise
call volumewise doesn’t allow them to. But again if you have
somebody that really takes and you have a customer that is really upset
and you take it upon yourself to sort it out it is going to make your
job more interesting, isn’t it?
(trainer)

Towards the end of our research it was noted that the readoption of a taskoriented approach (evidenced by productivity measures) was encouraging a
rigid time perception of the duration of the call and this contradicts the
processual time perceptions promoted during training. There is a sophisticated management control system, including monitoring technology,
which forms part of the disciplinary apparatus for staff. The call centre is
clearly an environment where staff are under pressure to perform, in terms
of both quality and quantity of output. In terms of quantitative measurement, the staff operate under a timed pressure system where everything is
routinely measured and monitored. The number of calls queuing (NCQ),
average delay in queuing (ADQ), average speed of answer (ASA), number
of agents signed in (NAGNT) are calculated instantly and visually displayed
on electronic call boards in the centre for all the teams to see. From such
measurements, a range of productivity statistics are produced relating to
individual and team performance on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
Although there are no formal statements, an informal understanding of
around 20 calls handled per hour has emerged as the norm. This ultimately
serves to discipline the staff in a competitive way since they attempt to
reach the norm and, indeed, feel guilty if falling below it with any regularity. Equally, to miss a queuing call is frowned upon by the staff
themselves as not only under-performing but, more importantly, ‘letting
the customer down’. Here we can see how there is a collective commitment to customers that operates to discipline performance in a way that
requires no explicit sanctions from management. In this sense, telephone
performance becomes individualized and competitive even though there is
no formal system of reward, such as commission-based salaries, to support
it. In terms of the quality of performance, service encounters are taped
regularly for purposes of appraisal monitoring and quality audits. Within
such tape reviews ordinarily between the adviser and her supervisor (see
also Frenkel et al. 1998: 965), staff are marked according to scripted

124 Gender and work in capitalist economies

responses and techniques, such as politeness, conversational control, clarity
of information, addressing service opportunities and standard opening and
closings. Throughout the exchange, staff are expected to adhere consistently to the missionary messages of ‘quality, value and service’.

Temporal clashes, resistances and attrition

Motivation and staff training have become a big issue within the call centre
industry although, according to Frenkel et al. (1998: 965), companies
typically only spend 5 per cent of their business unit budgets on training.
The recruitment consultant, Austin Knight, conducted a study into call
centre management and staff motivation in 1997. The survey of 1000 call
centre employees revealed that more than half felt morale was low. While
some companies have labour turnover rates as low as 4 per cent a year, in
others it is above 30 per cent. Burnout varies depending on the company
and the product but, on average, call centre operators last 18 months before
moving on to another job, albeit in exactly the same line of business. While
presently experiencing attrition levels at lower than average levels, BNFS’s
customer service employees spoke of low morale and significant levels of
stress and frustration. Our findings suggest these emotions to be in part the
consequence of temporal clashes between task and process orientations to
the service encounter. This conclusion is further confirmed by the following reports of dissatisfaction as regards the role of senior advisers.

Senior advisers, role status and temporal ambiguity

The role of senior advisers is critical in the call centre culture. They act as a
buffer zone between advisers and the management layers. Half of their time
is spent on calls and half on escalated problem calls and project management. They are being encouraged to become multiskilled across various
functions to increase their flexibility and ensure service quality. A central
objective of quality management is that of involving every member of the
organization in the corporate pursuit of excellent service quality. But when
the metaphorical ‘quality chain’ is directly competing with call volume,
then task becomes paramount. Senior customer advisers are currently being
encouraged to subordinate their quality exercises to more task-oriented
activities during periods of high call volume.

Well, at the moment, I think that it is almost to do with the TCS and
the monitoring of the seniors’ roles. I can understand that I ought to
get on the phones, on the other hand, I think that they ought to take
us out of the phone equation and any time we can get on to the
phone, it is a bonus. Rather than try and sort of say that you have got
to be on the phones for 25–60 per cent of the time. Because I think


-----

Post-Fordist production: the call centre 125

my prime part of the job is helping the other people not just in my
team but throughout the whole company.
(senior customer adviser)

This process versus task clash is even more evident when one enquires into
the Senior Customer Adviser’s (SCA) role in Quality Assurance (QA).
Quality Assurance (QA) refers to the period immediately after training in
which the newly qualified Customer Advisers (CA) are quality checked to
ensure that their work is up to the necessary standards. According to their
original role description, the SCAs are responsible for Quality Assurance.
But we have found that SCAs are not being allocated sufficient time to
provide the QA coaching prescribed by their role. Moreover, it is quite
often the case that, in the absence of SCAs, other less experienced members
of the team are providing the quality assurance for new starters. This
situation, and the resulting tensions, would appear to be a consequence of a
growing conflict between output/performance and quality/service cultures
within the organization. But what is particularly interesting here is how
employees negotiate the conflicting temporal and other demands of a reemerging task-oriented organizational culture. This is evidenced in the
following transcription excerpt where the respondent discusses her forthcoming performance tape review:

You do have choice on whether they tell you or not. Sometimes you
prefer not to be told about it. It is good to get appraised because it
confirms that you are doing the right things once its pointed out to
you.
(customer adviser)

Significantly, by opting not to be told when her performance manager
would be listening to her transactions to assess their quality, this individual
had inadvertently extended the realms of her regulation to any time during
the performance review. Our point is that, through identifying with an
idea of quality inscribed in organization culture, ideology and practice,
employees contribute to the intense forms of surveillance that serve to
regulate their conduct. Integral to these conditions of subjectification is the
articulation of what staff commonly refer to as ‘the company way’, which is
a combination of commitment to exemplary standards of customer service
quality and ongoing customer focus. Although partly organizational
mythology, the ‘company way’ is simultaneously a descriptive category
used by many of the staff to reconcile the tempo-spatially conflicting shifts,
transformations and contradictions in organizational dictates and
procedures.

Discussion

For a generation of sociologists, advances in information technology
provide a near-perfect analogy of the principle of discipline. The incessant
dedication to electronic performance monitoring and ubiquitous accumulation of coded information, evident in call centre operations, are often
cited as typifying disciplinary modes of regulating activities in time/space
(Sewell and Wilkinson 1992). But there is a tendency here to interpret
Foucault’s account of disciplinary technologies as hyper-rational tempospatial systems capable of ‘electronically tagging’, tracing and regulating
passive bodies within insidiously coercive ‘information panopticons’.
Axiomatic to this techno-determinist reading of Foucault (1979) is an
absolutist conception of linear time/space as well as a heavily circumscribed, if not deterministic conception of subjectivity. But this limited
reading fundamentally fails to recognize Foucault’s Discipline and Punish as
detailing technologies and techniques constituted through the cooperation of linear and social times. As he puts it:

The disciplinary methods reveal a linear time whose moments are
integrated, one upon another, and which is orientated towards a
terminal, stable point; in short, an ‘evolutive time’. But it must be
recalled that, at the same moment, the administrative and economic
techniques of control reveal a social time of a serial, orientated
cumulative type; the discovery of an evolution in terms of ‘progress’.
(Foucault 1979a: 160)

Foucault’s account of discipline is clearly not limited to the quantitative
dimensions of linear time. Rather social times involve a ‘discovery of an
evolution in terms of genesis . . . of individual’ (1979a). While linear time
makes possible the ‘serration of activities . . . in each moment of time’, the
‘possibility of accumulating time and activity, of rediscovering them,
totalised and usable in a final result . . .’ (1979a). Social times enable the
subjectification of subjects, whereby ‘the small temporal continuum of
individuality-genesis certainly seems to be, like the individuality-cell or the
individuality organism, an effect and an object of discipline’ (1979a: 161).
The copresence of objectifying linear and subjectifying social times induces
‘a macro- and a micro-physics of power’, a ‘temporal unitary, continuous,
cumulative dimension in the exercise of controls and practices of domination’ (1979a: 160). It is at this interface that ‘power is articulated directly
into time’ (1979a: 160), assuring its control and guaranteeing its use.
Our case study to varying degrees illustrates subjectification as concerning the establishment of forms of relations of self with self through
disciplinary practices and the incessant codification and material organization of conduct in time and space. It illustrates how subjectivity is
constituted in and through the embedded temporalities of management
practices in general and quality processes in particular. Consistent concerns
with achieving ‘empathy’, through person-centred service delivery

Post-Fordist production: the call centre 127

encouraged a ‘processual’-orientation to both the content and duration of
the service encounter. Reconstituted as a care-centred activity, the service
encounter is neither linear, continuous nor entirely measurable, rather, it is
part of several different ongoing, non-abstract processes, whereby, ‘the task
itself defines the amount of time to be consumed, rather than a time limit
or temporal demarcation being placed on the task’ (Davies 1990: 37). The
language and timing of empathy enabled employees to secure a sense of
meaning and identity by acting in accordance with the norms and values
that the quality programme conveyed.
But this process of identification also served to reproduce the employee’s
conditions of regulation and subjugation. For empathy, as a form of
emotional labour, demands an engagement with self whereby ‘she [sic]
offers personalised service, but she herself becomes identified with the
–ized part of it’ (Hochschild 1983: 187). Constructed and reconstructed
through the qualitative embodied times of process, the subject becomes
self-disciplined to securing work conditions which, on the one hand, offer
a means of ameliorating the stultifying monotony of call centre work,
while, on the other, subjecting the employee to increased performance
regulation. For empathy to be productive, it has to be standardized. Or as
one team manager expressed it, ‘Efficiency linked with quality . . . at the
end of the day, with the nicest will in the world it is still a business. It still
has to make money.’ Consequently, there is no question of quality programmes resulting in the abandonment of performance as a control in our
case study. Indeed, our work further confirms that the distinctively social
character of call centre work demands a greater reliance on managing
through identity and this is often a process dependent on comparative
performance. The team manager quoted earlier, described at length how
customer advisers had increasingly sought quantitative measures with
which to compare their progress. As he expresses it:

Conversations I have had, it becomes apparent to me that people
want to measure themselves against something. They feel starved of
some kind of, I don’t whether it is efficiency measure but they feel
starved of some kind of target. They want something to work
towards.
(team manager)

Munro (1998: 53) describes how in the post-bureaucratic organization
‘what counts is both singing from the same hymn sheet as your superiors
and delivery of the auditable numbers for which you have agreed to be
responsible’. Dividing practices (Foucault 1982) then separate the good
performers from the bad, extra training from the former often being given
to the latter in case the identity of performance delivery has not quite
‘caught on’. It is necessary to recognize that, despite considerable tension
and some conflict surrounding working intensification demands, resistance
to the new productivity and performance measures is comparatively constrained. Rather, employees willingly engage with training programmes


-----

128 Gender and work in capitalist economies

geared at producing normative standards of delivery. But here resides a
perplexing paradox. If the social times of quality management have
effectively transformed individuals into self-disciplined subjects who are
involved in their work body and soul, why is the call centre industry
currently beset by high rates of attrition?
Knights and McCabe (1998b: 192) identify quality innovations as frequently failing to reconcile ‘an internal drive for control over processes and
people’ with ‘the trust, teamworking and creative processes that are also
asserted to be a condition of quality management’. Consequently, the
conditions of quality innovation are simultaneously contradicted by
management’s preoccupation with control translated as the standardization
of quality service delivery. While alleviating the repetitive and routinized
conditions of call centre work, the embodied qualitative times of process
provide little protection against the quantitative disembodied times of
‘speed up’. No doubt variations exist with regard to employees’ means of
reconciling the conflicting temporal demands of quality and increasing
levels of performance measurement. But for those employees seduced by
the promise of a secure sense of self, the choices are limited. If they
persevere with trying to meet the performance targets until the self is
depleted and no longer able to achieve empathy, the quality of their work
will suffer irretrievable deterioration. But if they try to preserve the quality
of service encounters, it is likely they will miss their volume or performance targets and be subject to management discipline or dismissal. Either
they reject the meaningful embodied social relations of quality or risk
losing their jobs.
The management of the call centre labour process is therefore caught on
the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, managers are attracted to an
intensification of work through information technology supported, performance measures and techniques of surveillance. On the other hand,
however, call centre employment is characterized by a uniquely social
mode of work where staff performance is dependent on socially sensitive
communication and involves the whole person and not just the employee’s
physical participation. Meeting call volume performance targets, for
example, may totally contradict the demands for quality and customer
service.

Conclusion

This chapter has been concerned to examine the conduct of call centre staff
in one case study and, in doing so, has come to question the labelling of
these new, admittedly work-intensive, developments in the workplace
organization as a modern equivalent to the nineteenth-century sweatshop.
Part of the analysis is focused on developing our understanding of the selfdisciplined subject and call centre workplace subjectivity. In some recent
research on call centres there is a recognition of subjectivity as both the


-----

Post-Fordist production: the call centre 129

medium and outcome of time–space events (Collinson and Collinson
1997; Baldry 1998; Taylor and Bain 1998). Of particular interest to our
work, Collinson and Collinson (1997: 35) examine the processes of
negotiation and resistance through which global processes of time/space
come to be translated within particular workplaces, into surveillance
practices that have significant gender effects. Cognizant of a tendency for
gendered discourses of time to ‘romanticize’ and ‘essentialize’ women’s
differences, Collinson and Collinson avoid conceptualizing ‘gendered
time/space’. Consequently, gendered time struggles to avoid an association
with essentialized gender difference. Conversely, gendered time has been
conceptualized in this chapter as discursively constituted through socially
contingent gendered power/knowledge relations. Process time is both a
condition and consequence of specific management practices, geared
towards the achievement of ‘empathy’ with consumers.
Gendered time enables an understanding of the social process, whereby
BNFS staff willingly turn themselves into self-disciplined subjects who put
in performances without management having to use up resources in distributing rewards and sanctions. It was argued that the principle and
practice of achieving empathy encouraged a processual relation to the
service encounter. Integral to this orientation is an engagement with self
and the exercise of emotional labour. These features enables the employee
to attribute a sense of meaning and value to their work, and in so doing, to
limit the negative effects of their participation in routinized and repetitive
tasks. But the capture of self in a culture of identifying with the customer
and the emotional labour that this involves were also highly vulnerable to
burn-out, frustration and even resistance. So, for example, there was muted
if not open resistance to the ‘speeding up’ or accelerated work processes
that were consequent on the re-emergence of a task-oriented culture. Part
of this ‘muted resistance’ and/or resigned accommodation appears to be the
consequence of subjective identification with BNFS’s organizational
commitment to quality, customer service and the brand. One might argue
that inherent conflicts between the company’s process and task-orientation
were reconciled by a renewed identification with and commitment to
achieving the company’s desire for quality customer service. This was
evidenced by the desire among some employees for the reintroduction of
quantitative measures to enable comparative assessments of their progress.
Our case study, at BNFS, may be seen as unique because of the distinctive role of the brand, the discretion, and the ease with which the
company achieves its competitive success but the arguments arising from
the case could have analytical purchase elsewhere. By understanding call
centre workplace subjectivities in terms of their embeddedness in organizational imagery, branding, service ideology and work, we can begin to
unravel the conditions and consequences of staff’s self-subjugation. If
nothing else, it encourages the analysis of call centres to move beyond the
abject pessimism of research that sees call centres only in terms of the
technologies of surveillance, on the one hand, and the uncalled for


-----

130 Gender and work in capitalist economies

optimism of the quality and virtual reality gurus, on the other. While not
necessarily endorsing Frenkel et al.’s (1998) thesis regarding call centres
being a hybrid form of organization that they call ‘mass customized
bureaucracy’, we certainly share their view that current representations of
their practices are far from satisfactory.

Gender identity and just-in-time production

The postmodern condition suggests that we are experiencing an intense
phase of time/space compression and their fragmentation both globally and
locally (Harvey 1990). Unparalleled advances in communication technology have intensified, fragmented and dramatically delineated complex
value chains inducing systemic disorder in the chronology of time and
space, whereby, ‘split-second capital transactions, flex-time enterprises,
variable life working time . . . systematically mix tenses in their occurrence’
(Castells 2000: 464). Advances in information technology enable the
‘software universe’ of modern capitalist production to traverse space, literally and in ‘no time’ (Bauman 2001: 117). Networks pervade the new
social morphology disaggregating capital, labour and global institutions into
diverse tempo-spatial contexts. Flows of capital, information and technology, produce ‘timeless time’ as ‘things are happening instantaneously
and linearity is broken in the discontinuity of hyperlinks, menus, etc.’ (Van
Dijk 1999: 373).
Postmodernity marks the demise of representational time and this
invokes a loss in the narrative chronology of everyday modern experience.
We no longer live our lives through identities imbued with coherent
narrative meaning. Rather, the flexibilization of postmodern existence
enables a disengagement of free agents from co-operative projects and
endeavours. Time in modernity is not only a narrative temporality but also
axiomatic to the reflexive construction of modern subjectivity (Giddens
1991). Thus, ‘self-identity is not a distinctive trait possessed by the individual. It is a self as reflexively understood by the person in terms of her/his
biography’ (1991: 53). A crucial effect then of modern narrativity is the
‘handing down of possibilities from the self to the self’ which has the effect


-----

132 Gender and work in capitalist economies

of ‘stretching’ our ‘Being across time’ (Thomas 1996: 45). This is to say
that the reconnection of the self through time is a crucial source of selfidentity. But the excessive ephemerality, fragmentation and time/space
compression of postmodernity, radically disrupt the signifying continuities
that characterize narrative time. One indication of this disjuncture is evident in the writings of Bauman (1997), when he identifies the postmodern
self as characterized by the avoidance of fixed identity. As he puts it, ‘The
hub of postmodern life strategy is not making identity stand – but the
avoidance of being fixed’ (1997: 89).
There is clearly intensity and tension (Cooper and Law 1995) around
postmodern temporal/spatial relations that were perhaps not so evident
within representational regimes where the boundaries between one time
and another or different spaces were more clear-cut. Manifestations of
these tensions abound. This chapter focuses on feminist responses to the
intensified, fragmented times of post-Fordist flexible specialization
(McDowell 1991; 1997; Massey 1994; Wigfield 2001; Wajcman and
Martin 2002). Focusing on just-in-time labour, the chapter challenges the
fixed, unitary, relational subject of feminist critique. The theoretical premise of this challenge assumes that there is no essential self, which exists
outside of culture and language. The experience of women in the transient
time/spaces of post-Fordism’s fragmented reality cannot be taken as an
unproblematic starting point for feminist theory, because that experience
has no overriding, permanent meaning. Chapter 5 introduced deconstruction as a strategy, which subverts the classical oppositions of the
metaphysics of presence and in so doing, unsettles the phallocentric binary
that it creates. This chapter deconstructs the temporal logic of post-Fordist
flexible accumulation. The central aim of this exercise is to reveal an
unsettling reconfiguration of gender and narrativity at work, in postFordist accumulation, and to examine its consequences.
This chapter is structured into two main sections. The first part theoretically engages with key feminist discourses, which have sought to provide accounts of gender inequality in post-Fordist labour processes. The
second draws upon the seminal work of Richard Sennett (1998), to suggest
that just-in-time labour is precipitative of systemic disruptions in narrative
constructions of social time. The chapter provides some empirical support
for Sennett’s conclusion. More specifically, the chapter includes an analysis
of classified advertisements for marketing vacancies. The empirical data
drives from a quota sample of advertisements from the Times Digital
Archive 1785–1985. The findings of my document analysis support Sennett’s assertions regarding contemporary work and the corrosive effects of
the marketing of the self.
Several other writers have also drawn attention to the corrosive effects of
just-in-time labour. Adam (1995) describes the flexibilization of working
times as having a decontextualizing impact on people’s lives. As she puts it,
‘The decoupling of work time from the time of the organisation and from
the collective rhythms of public and familial activities erodes communal


-----

Flexible work and restructuring gender identity 133

activities in both the public and the private realm’ (1995: 103). Castells
describes how the ‘dissolution of shared identities’ has become tantamount
to a modern era in which subjects are ‘unable to adapt to networking of
firms and individualization of work’ (2002: 354). He identifies salient
feminist challenges to the disembodied spatial flows and timeless times of
intensified flexible labour. Castells variously describes how ‘feminist sexual
identity movements affirm the control of their most immediate spaces,
their bodies, over their disembodiment in the space of flows’ (2002: 358).
But mainstream feminist analysis has tended to theorize just-in-time
labour through the production of dualistic constructions of gender differentiation. Gender, time and post-Fordist labour processes are analysed
through fundamental antinomies between male and female experiences.
Conversely, deconstruction reveals both feminine and masculine identities
to be problematized by the fragmented temporalities of just-in-time labour.
Empirical evidence of this complexity is evident in work-preference surveys which variously reveal that ‘the long hours culture is criticised by
women and men alike for interfering with home life’ (EOC 2001: 4). This
chapter draws attention to the crucial role played by narrative in the
construction and interpretation of gender identity. A focus on narrative
reflexivity suggests a way beyond the antinomies of male versus female
experiences of post-Fordist labour processes. Conceptualizing the narrative
dimensions of gender identity expresses the sedimentation of time in discursive practices and the intersections of different forms of time in the
constitution of gendered subjectivity. It is clear that self-identity, in the
modern era, presumes a unique form of narrativity. Time is axiomatic to
the narrative of self, whereby self-realization involves ‘holding a dialogue
with time’ (Giddens 1991: 77). Our lives are always a process of linking the
past with the future by giving a sense of continuity to an ever changing
narrative of self. As Heidegger (2006: 456) states, ‘temporality is constitutive for Dasein’s Being . . . as a state-of-Being which belongs to
existence, [Dasein] is ‘‘at bottom’’ temporality’. Heidegger makes it clear
that not only history but natural processes too are determined ‘by time’
(2006: 456). It is therefore imperative on us to recognize ‘the time ‘‘in
which’’ entities are encountered’ (2006: 456). This is also to recognize that
‘Dasein as temporality temporalizes a kind of behaviour which relates itself
to time be taking it into its reckoning’ (2006: 457). To this extent, subjective interpretations of time coexist with rationalized systems of time
reckoning. Thus, our apprehension of time is interpreted through the
process of Being. The plurivocality of Being in Time resolves the potential
antinomies between ‘sameness’ and ‘selfhood’ (Ricoeur 1990). Narrative
mediations weave self-identities in the context of time, but they do so in
the context of discursive struggles to define modern selfhood. Indeed,
while ‘imaginative variations’ (Ricoeur 1990) in narrative mediations
render the self open to reconfiguration, the historical durability of discourse affects the creative nature of intersubjective meaning (McNay 1999:
325). One can anticipate the argument in terms of gendered subjectivity.


-----

134 Gender and work in capitalist economies

The interpollations of gendered self-consciousness require interpretation
and it is in the act of elucidation that narrative acquires its centrality.
Discursive identities are interpretative in nature. Meaning is not inherent
to the discursive constructs of gendered identity, but is the product of
interpretative strategies that agents employ to link action with narrational
meaning. This chapter draws attention to disruptions in the narrative time
of modern work. It argues that these disruptions have displaced linear
time’s centrality to the productive economy. The instantaneous times of
post-Fordist labour processes invoke a systemic perturbation in the
chronological ordering of time, which significantly unsettles both masculine and feminine narrative identities.

Reflections on the implications of post-Fordism for gender
relations at work

Linear, irreversible, measurable, predictable time is being shattered in
the network society, in a movement of extraordinary historical significance. But we are not just witnessing a relativisation of time . . .
The transformation is more profound; it is the mixing of tenses to
create a forever universe, not self-expanding but self-maintaining, not
cyclical but random, not recursive but inclusive; timeless time, using
technology to escape the context of its existence, and to appropriate
selectively any value each context could offer to the ever-present.
(Castells 2000: 433)

Unparalleled advances in information technology have maximized
‘knowledge-based productivity’ making possible the globalization of the
economy. Axiomatic to the revolution of informationalism is the fragmentation of power which ‘is no longer concentrated in institutions (the
state), organizations (capitalist firms), or symbolic controllers’ (Castells
2002: 359). Rather, power is diffused into global networks of capital,
information, real and virtual images ‘which circulate and transmute in a
system of variable geometry and dematerialized geography (2002: 359).
Liberated from the linear rationalist boundaries of ‘organized capitalism’,
flows of capital, information, images and symbols dissolve linear time by
disturbing the chronological sequence of events. As networks progressively
constitute the new social morphology of our societies, distances between
networks contract, enabling light-speed operations. ‘Space of flows’ induce
‘systemic perturbation in the sequential order of phenomena’, which may
assume the form of instantaneity or else ‘random discontinuity in the
sequence’ (Castells 2000: 464).
Industrialization brought linear synchronicity to the assembly lines of
Fordist factories. It heralded clock time as the central organizing principle
of modernist production. But this linear, predictable time is being radically
challenged in post-Fordist production. The linear chronological time of


-----

Flexible work and restructuring gender identity 135

mass production has been displaced by a contextual relativity ‘to the
temporality of other firms, networks, processes or products’ (Castells 2000:
439). And in the ‘network society’ capital operates globally as a unit ‘in real
time’ (2000: 470), as its subjects and objects circulate at rates of light-speed
velocity. Lash and Urry (1994: 2–3) identify the accelerated circulation of
objects ‘as the stuff of consumer capitalism’, whereby a depletion of
meaning precipitated by rapid turnover rates ensues a ‘homogenization,
abstraction, anomie and the destruction of the subject’ (1994: 3). Thus the
transformed productive economy has specific consequences for work,
identity and the labour process.

Just-in-time labour

Discontinuous reinvention of institutions. Business manuals and
magazines today tend to portray flexible behaviour as requiring the
desire for change; but in fact it is change of a particular sort, with
particular consequences for our sense of time.
(Sennett 1998: 47)

Harvey (1990) defines post-Fordism as involving a transition from Fordism
to ‘flexible accumulation’, which accelerated the rise of flexible labour
markets and flexible geographies of production. Piore and Sabel (1984)
identify a demassification of consumer markets as having precipitated a
breakdown of Fordist production. Rapidly fragmenting consumer markets
are further coupled with advances in flexible technologies (e.g., Computer
Aided Manufacturing) enabling low cost, semicustomized commodities.
Piore and Sabel identify these transformations in production as evidence of
a new post-Fordist technological paradigm defined as ‘flexible specialization’. Flexible technologies and economies of scale, enable firms to
‘respond to the growth of flexible markets’ (1995b: 15). Organizational
flexibility is axiomatic to the new technological paradigm and is manifest in
the prevalence of ‘decentralised management’ techniques (Amin 1995b: 2).
It is evident that the application of flexibility to the organization of work
translates into two significant forms of operation: functional flexibility and
numerical flexibility. Functional flexibility relates to the use of ‘labour
across functional boundaries’ (Reilly 2001: 28). Numerical flexibility refers
to the variety of ways ‘organisations vary the numerical input to their work
to meet the changing demand for labour’ (2001: 30). The concept of justin-time labour relates specifically to numerical flexibility, and describes the
use of fixed term contracts, casual seasonal labour, agency labour, freelancers and outsourcing to respond to fluctuating demands for goods and
services. Certainly its distinguishing features are not new; flexibility,
flexitime and flexible hours have extended historical trajectories. But what
is new is the reapplication of flexibility to redefine the worker. Numerical
flexibility suggests a form of time/space compression which no longer seeks
profitability through ‘extracting more time from labor or more labor from

time under the clock imperative’ (Castells 2000: 437). This indicates quite
disturbing transformations in the organization of the labour process.
Although a class-based analysis of these trends is a worthy topic, in this
chapter it is a stimulant for examining feminist responses to gender differentials in the organization of just-in-time labour.

Just-in-time labour and feminist critique

Wigfield (2001) details the prevalence of women in employment sectors
and occupations, characterized by numerical flexibility.[1] She explains these
employment patterns in terms of broader inequalities in the domestic
division of labour, and their manifestation into gender segregation in postFordist work. Women’s dual participation in paid employment and unpaid
domestic work, means that women often struggle to work full-time and
opt for part-time, temporary jobs or home working to accommodate the
ascribed domestic constraints on their time. Elsewhere, feminists have
described tensions between the ascribed domestic responsibilities of
women and the demands of numerical and functional flexibility. Franks
(1999) describes how just-in-time labour involves the reconstitution of self
to that of a ‘freelancer’, whose movement between short-term contracts is
engineered by a markedly adaptable array of portfolio skills. Similarly
Castells describes how the inventory of management procedures for lean
production is increasingly dependent on skilled labour ‘freed’ to make
decisions in ‘real time’ (2000: 437). Moreover, skilled labour is increasingly
‘required to manage its own time in a flexible manner, sometimes adding
more work time, at other times adjusting to flexible schedules, in some
instances reducing working hours and thus pay’ (2000: 437). Similarly,
Sennett (1998: 48) draws our attention to how short-term flexible change
seeks to decisively and irrevocably reinvent institutions so that immediate
futures detach the present from the past. Feminist writers describe this
decoupling of immediate futures from the collective rhythms of organizational time (public and familial activities), as fundamentally in conflict
with the domestic and economic constraints which shape female patterns of
employment (McDowell 1991; Coates 1997; Walby 1997; Franks 1999;
Wigfield 2001). While sympathetic to these feminist discourses, closer
analyses reveals their various contributions to be united by a systemic male
versus female dualistic opposition. For example, the dual systems framework adopted by Wigfield (2001) describes how patriarchy in conjunction
with capitalism, constrains women’s experiences of post-Fordist labour
processes.
Elsewhere, Castells quotes Irigaray ([1984] 1993) to illustrate how
feminists have sought to gain control of ‘their most immediate spaces, their
bodies, over the disembodiment in the space of flows’ (Castells 2002: 358).
He describes how, motivated by patriarchalism, the space of flows facilitates a disembodiment of the female form through ‘reconstructed images
of the woman, and fetishes of sexuality’, which ‘dissolve their humanity

and deny their identity’. Irigaray ([1984] 1993: 7) promotes ‘a change in
our perceptions and conceptions of space/time’ as we enter the new age.
She advances an entreaty for ‘the inhabiting of places, and of containers, or
envelopes of identity’ to subvert women’s place in man’s history. Franks
also vehemently challenges an acceleration towards labour conditions in
which time is increasingly sacrificed for money and longer hours at work
are equated with personal status. In these situations, ‘men have tended to
be more inclined to sacrifice time for additional money . . . women have
been more inclined to seek a trade-off to give them more time’ for family
responsibilities (Franks 1999: 68). Franks further describes the difficulties
encountered by women as they attempt to reconcile the highly variant
working patterns and hours of flexible work with the ‘relational’ temporal
rhythms of childcare. She states: ‘It is self-evident that if small children are
involved, there is a requirement for stability and regular routines, yet the
freelance life means there can be periods of intense work and then no
work’ (1999: 90). Franks identifies the intensity of ‘just-in-time’ work
schedules as particularly problematic for the freelance female employee,
who having joined ‘to the male working culture, are obliged to rank
money before time’. Wajcman and Martin (2002) draw attention to the
negation of gender difference in the ‘reflexive modernisation’ thesis
(Giddens 1991; Beck 1992) and Sennett’s ‘corrosion of character’ thesis.
Criticism is levied at the centrality ascribed to personal goals in the
reflexive shaping of family and career aspirations. Giddens’s ‘project of self’
is described as negating the gendered constraints ‘of identities with a strong
‘‘traditional’’ moral content’ (Wajcman and Martin 2002: 999). Narrative
analysis of 136 managers revealed that while male and female managers
converge in the use of ‘market’ metaphors to construct a coherent narrative
of self, a ‘deep sense of conflict’ distinguished female experiences of juggling familial responsibilities (2002: 994). One gains here a sense of the
significance of gendered relations to the temporal logic of numerical
flexibility. An equally thought-provoking account of gender, numerical
flexibility and identity is provided in recent feminist discussions of the postFordist career construct.
Hopfl and Atkinson (2000: 140) provide a brief, but insightful reflection
with regards to the gendered impact of numerical flexibility on the career
construct. When referring to organizational relations in modernist time(s),
they describe a ‘period in which women sought to define themselves as
quasi-men’ (2000: 140). An episteme, which they predict ‘is coming to an
end [as] the desire for phallic-power (Kristeva 1980) is being seen for what
it is and the costs found to be too great’ (Hopfl and Atkinson 2000: 140).
The erosion of the narrative career is heralded, by Hopfl and Atkinson, as
presenting revolutionary possibilities for women. For, ‘these changes
expose some of the ambivalences which women have experienced in their
careers through the duality of commitment to home and work’ (2000:
140). These ambivalences relate to incongruences between the ascribed
domestic responsibilities of women and the prerequisite of full-time career


-----

138 Gender and work in capitalist economies

development. In the writings of Hopfl and Atkinson, female experiences of
these incongruences provide a constant threat to the necessary fictions,
which sustain the modernist career construct. The logic of rational
evaluation, so central to the career construct, is identified as concealing the
inherent ‘untidiness’ of life plans as ‘decisions do not always conform to a
rational pattern’. Female experiences threaten to expose the irresolvable
antinomies of rational action by thrusting into the organizational arena the
‘conflicts of authority which confront women who work’ (2000: 139). As
women articulate the incompatibility of a work time which delineates
public from private ‘issues of choice, personal responsibilities and personal
meaning are thrown into focus’.
The increasing pervasiveness of numerical flexibility and just-in-time
labour is argued, by Hopfl and Atkinson, to represent a radical disjuncture
from the rationalist logic of the modernist organizational career. The
fragmented times of just-in-time labour draw ‘more on notions of
ambivalence and discontinuity than on clear and sequential series of career
advances’ (2000: 141). And in so doing this represents a powerful alternative discursive regime, ‘one that poses a threat to the notion of a unitary
trajectory of career development’ and reveals the paradoxes at the root of
this masculine orthodoxy. For instance, the forms of contractual agreements associated with the enforcement of numerical flexibility are
described, by Hopfl and Atkinson, as producing dramatic disruptions in the
reciprocal relations between employer and employee. Consequently
employees are beginning to re-evaluate the rationalist career structure and
the forms of organizational commitment, which it presupposes. Curiously,
Hopfl and Atkinson (2000: 140) describe how, while these changes herald
a crisis in masculinity, women are less threatened by the ambivalences and
insecurities precipitated by the organizational restructuring required to
implement numerical flexibility. Indeed, women have historically struggled
to sustain organizational commitment and, thus employment insecurity
‘has been a familiar context of women’s working experience for a long
time’ (2000: 140). What is significant here is the inference that numerical
flexibility has precipitated a disruption in gendered relations to linear
rationalist work models. And more specifically, that the ambivalences and
insecurities, which threaten to implode the construct of the modernist
career, are apparently less threatening to women. For this ‘male’/‘female’
opposition (or even ‘feminine’/‘masculine’ dualisms which assume each
element to have a concrete existence in the world) partake of a tradition
which constitutes the feminine as ‘Other’ to the masculine order (Hekman
1990; Game 1991). In this sense, feminist discourses, which valorize
essentialist distinctions, as mediating gendered relations to post-Fordist
labour processes, unintentionally reproduce these gendered inequalities
(e.g., Hopfl and Atkinson 2000). An alternative perspective involves
deconstructing the times/spaces of post-Fordist just-in-time labour. The
following section introduces a theoretical account of gender and time,
which suggests that gendered relations to post-Fordist numerical flexibility

are uniquely linked to systemic disruptions in the prevalence of modernist
narrative time(s) at work.

Systemic disruptions in narrative time/space

In Being and Time Heidegger’s account of Dasein informs our comprehension of human identity as stretched across time (Thomas 1996: 51).
Being is dispersed through the chronicles of time. The existential time of
Dasein possesses an intense immediacy, uniquely relevant to the person.
And yet Dasein, as a concept, also draws attention to the way subjectivity is
always lived in embodied form (Thomas 1996). Subjects live time/space
events as well as being constituted by them. Time is, therefore, inextricably
bound up with places, spaces and the body. For people ‘do not so much
think real time but actually live it sensuously, qualitatively’ (Urry 1995: 6).
The identity, which emerges in the process of the self, stretches across time
as ‘the person one is now has a historical connection with the person
whom one was yesterday’ (Thomas 1996: 45). By reflecting upon previous
experience, present contingencies and future desires, the self is consistently
bringing itself into existence (1996: 52). Narrativity is thus axiomatic to
modern self-identity. Indeed, Giddens (1991: 76) describes how the production of an interpretative self-history is central to self-identity in modern
social life. The ‘reflexive monitoring’ of self ‘forms a trajectory of development from the past to the anticipated future’ (1991: 75). Giddens
describes the future as resonant with possibilities, ‘yet not left open to the
full play of contingency’. Foucault (1979a), in particular, demonstrates the
profound historicity of modern subjectivity. Society and culture provide
specific ‘technologies of the self’ through which identities are constituted.
The self is a developing site of cultural inscription (Thomas 1996: 47). Our
existential experiences of time are reinscriptive of society’s social rhythms
rather than mere representations. The modern self as a narrative text is
always lived in an embodied form so that ‘subjects are dialogical, bringing
specific personas, discourses and voices to contexts of negotiation, and
domination’ (Thrift 1991: 461, quoted in Thomas 1996: 47). But what
becomes of narrative time when, as is currently evident, epistemic struggles
transform cultural texts into polysemic spaces ‘where the paths of several
possible meanings intersect’? (Barthes 1987: 37). More specifically, how is
narrative time reconfigured amid the just-in-time discontinuities of postFordist production?
Concepts such as ‘instantaneous time’, ‘timeless time’ and the ‘space of
flows’ alert us to tempo-spatial disruptions, incoherencies and inconsistencies involved in post-Fordism’s break with narrative time/space. Lash
and Urry (1987: 299) describe how in disorganized capitalism the narrative
propensity of time is ‘less rational and has come to resemble a succession of
disconnected events’. Consequently in post-organized capitalism, ‘our
temporality is in part then a ‘‘calculating hedonism’’ in which these


-----

140 Gender and work in capitalist economies

‘‘mini-rationalities’’ are packed into a larger and overarching irrationality’
(1987: 299). The theme of dislocated ‘presentism’ is evidenced in Jameson’s (1984) discourse. Postmodernity, as the cultural logic of late capitalism, displaces biographical narratives with disembodied spectacles,
flattening the unconscious into a pervasively schizophrenic reality (Lash
and Urry 1987: 298). Jameson’s despair resides with the interminable
consequences of instantaneous time. For, the demise of narrativity results in
the suppression of history, resulting in ‘our identities and especially political
and collective identities [being] rendered incoherent’ (Lash and Urry 1987:
298). The loss of narrative realism and the self as a coherently reflexive
project embedded in time/space events resonates through Castell’s (1997)
Network Society. Castells (1997: 355) describes the ‘networkers’ (as opposed
to the networked), as individualized subjects governed by patterns of
‘rational expectations’, self-centred strategic calculations and driven by an
insatiable Dionysian nomadic existence. The following section attempts to
draw attention to the gendered impact of the erosion of narrative realism in
post-Fordist time(s). Deconstruction is applied here to reveal how postFordist production unsettles key narratives of modernist work and the
gendered relations, which are their condition and outcome.

Engendering the demise of the narrative career and work ethic

The potential loss of a long-term future threatens career, hitherto
invested with a future orientation, with an identity crisis, and this in
turn will restrict individuals’ construction of their future. Thus the
future of career will both contribute to and result from the revolutions
taking place in the construction and experience of time and space.
(Collin 2000: 93)

Goffman (1959: 123) defines the ‘career’ as allowing ‘one to move back
and forth between the self and its significant society’. Elsewhere Heidegger
has drawn our attention to the movement of self-stretching across time as
axiomatic to the construction of self-identity. Clear affinities exist here
between Goffman’s account of the career and being across time. An indication of this is provided by Collin (2000: 91) whereby the career establishes ‘a time-line and a trajectory, around which personal narratives, with
their past, present and future could be woven’. In this sense, the self is a
story constituted through sets of events in the present, linked with
memories of the past and motivated by future anticipation. To the extent
that the Western construct of the career is pervasively oriented to the
future ‘individuals have been able to construct their future, and project
their sense of self around the future positions and roles . . . from various
domains and especially those from the work organization’ (2000: 91).
However, the centrality of a delineable future time to the modernist
construction of the career invokes significant gendered differences.

(The Times, Tuesday, 13 March 1962, p. 2; Issue 55338; col A.

The Times Digital Archive 1785–1985)

The advertisement is clearly directed at a masculine subject and this is
reinforced by the direct appeal to ‘Ambitious and conscientious men’. It is
my contention that the advertisement also promotes a gendered representation of the modern career. The reference to an ‘unusual career
opportunity’ and enterprising creativity are resonant with the futureoriented instrumentality presupposed of masculine identity. In Chapter 4,
it was argued that modernist masculine identities are discursively aligned up
with purposive-rational instrumentality and that this conception of self
manifests in the desire to control both self and Other. In this sense masculinity is transient, having to be forever renewed by an infinitesimal range
of new conquests and the, often unpredictable, approval of others (Kerfoot
and Knights 1996.). Significantly, Bauman (2001) identifies the protestant
work ethic as driven by compulsive individualism. He states:

The instrumental rationality favoured and privileged by the pilgrim’s
life prompts the search for such means as may perform the uncanny
feat of keeping the end of the efforts forever in sight while never
reaching proximity, of bringing the end ever closer while preventing
the distance from being brought to zero. The pilgrim’s life is a traveltowards-fulfilment, but ‘fulfilment’ in that life is tantamount to the
loss of meaning.
(Bauman 2001: 157)


-----

142 Gender and work in capitalist economies

One gains here an image of a ceaseless desire for control. But also an inane
futility, as Seidler (1989: 192) expresses it, masculine preoccupations with
control translate as a ‘desperate striving without ever really experiencing
the joy of fulfilment’. Similarly Bauman (2001: 157) goes on to describe
how ‘travelling towards the fulfilment gives the pilgrim’s life its meaning,
but the meaning it gives is blighted with a suicidal impulse; that meaning
cannot survive the completion of its destiny’. Parallels between the Protestant work ethic and instrumental rationality are no coincidence as both
have historical trajectories in rational linear time (Adam 1995). Linear time
by definition involves a kind of transcendence that trivializes the specificity
of the finite moment. It requires a kind of estrangement from the present
that entails dematerialization, abstraction and disembodiment (Ermarth
1992). Every present in linear time is in this way also the future. As
Ermarth (1992: 31) states:

The rationalization of consciousness that supports the continuity of
past and future, cause and project necessarily supports kinds of
thinking that seek to transcend the present, concrete, arbitrarily and
absolutely limited moment.

Linear time’s continual transcendence from the present resonates with
masculinity’s compulsive hyperactivity. As with masculinity, the discursive
constructs of linear time’s future orientation, encourage ceaseless instrumental planning and compulsive ‘possessive individualism’ (Macpherson
1962). Masculinity’s goal-oriented instrumental planning, encourages the
pursuit of abstract instrumental objectives that both reflect and reinforce a
disembodied and estranged relationship to the world. This involves acting
in such a way as to maximize one’s returns with a view to the future. But
the future always becomes the present at its point of realization. Consequently, masculinity strives to maximize its returns indefinitely; that is to
say into a future that will never be realized. Masculinity’s propensity for
instrumental rational behaviour, thus, involves means–ends forms of
behaviour where the end is always a means towards a future end of exactly
the same kind. How brittle and tenuous this narrative reveals itself to be as
it contends with the decentring timeless time of just-in-time labour.
Bauman (2001: 135) describes how, with the advent of ‘liquid modernity’, the modern romance with progress loses its allure as it becomes
‘individualized . . . deregulated and privatized’. It is now, Bauman argues,
‘individual men and women on their own who are expected to use,
individually, their own wits, resources and industry to lift themselves to a
more satisfactory condition’ (2001: 135). While the Protestant work ethic
was not renowned for its collectivist endeavour, the ‘future present’ of justin-time labour radically disrupts the narrative linearity of the modernist
work ethic. Examine the following advertisement for a marketing manager

This advertisement provides an interesting illustration of the form of
subjectivity axiomatic with marketing management in post-Fordist times.
Of particular significance is the presumption of a self that is stretched across
time/space and receptive to a multitude of communication structures.
Sennett (1998) describes how modern forms of teamwork are in many
ways diametrically opposed to the Protestant work ethic and the development of a coherent narrative of self. He states:

An ethic of the group as opposed to the individual, teamwork
emphasizes mutual responsiveness rather than personal validation. The
time of teams is flexible and orientated to specific short-term tasks,
rather than the reckoning of decades marked by withholding and

waiting. Teamwork, though, takes us into that domain of demeaning
superficiality, which besets the modern workplace. Indeed, teamwork
exits in the realm of tragedy to enact human relations as a farce.
(Sennett 1998: 106)

Sennett proceeds to provide a fascinating and highly engaging account of
contemporary teamwork and the unparalleled challenges it presents to the
linear work ethic of modern times. Central to this challenge is a seemingly
irascible ‘presentism’, which steadily erodes narrative meaning and value.
Sennett with his trademark autobiographical, nostalgic style convincingly
describes how ‘presentism’ undermines foundational fictions associated
with the Protestant work ethic. Some illustration of the necessary fictions
of modern work is provided in the following advertisement for a marketing
management position published in The Times, in August 1954:

MARKETING MANAGER wanted by S. Simpson Ltd., makers of
the world-famous DAKS clothes. Must have knowledge of selling,
advertising, presentation, and promotion, with ability to organize and
inspire sales force at home and overseas. Knowledge of clothing trade
desirable but not essential. The position is important, permanent and
progressive. Applications in writing, give full details of experience,
age, position held, will be regarded as confidential and should be
made to H. Balcon. Deputy Managing Director. S. Simpson Ltd., 92–
100. Stoke Newington Road, London N.16.
(The Times, Monday, 30 August 1954, p. 2; Issue 53023; col A.
University of London Research Library Services.
The Times Digital Archive 1785–1985)

The advertisement’s reference to the position as ‘important, permanent and
progressive’ can be linked with other narratives of modern work, such as
‘effectivity as achieved through accumulated experiences’, ‘work identity
as constructed through embodied organisational relations’ and ‘commitment to organisational cultural as a road to fulfilment’. These and other
narratives struggle to gain credence in a just-in-time context. But what is
significant here is how the turnstile dynamics of just-in-time production
reconfigures narrative time as it becomes ‘sliced into episodes dealt with
one at a time’ (Bauman 2001: 137).
The long-term horizons of the work ethic are giving way to the
immediate rewards of episodic work as ‘each episode must be revealed and
consumed in full before it is finished and a next episode starts’ (Bauman
2001: 137). Although this challenge to the Protestant work ethic is no real
tragedy, it leaves a trail of decentred deconstruction in its wake. Masculinity’s control ethic struggles to achieve definition in the absence of
instrumentally reasoned long-term projects. In such activities instrumentally masculine ways of being gain privilege through displays of stoic
resolution, deferred gratification, durability and accumulative rewards. In
just-in-time labour processes, the Protestant work ethic is under attack as it


-----

Flexible work and restructuring gender identity 145

becomes increasingly uncertain ‘whether the labour and effort invested
today will count as assets as long as it takes to reach reward’ (Bauman 2001:
162). But the emphasis, thus far, on masculinity should not be interpreted
as inferring that masculinity is particularly decentred by the irascible
‘presentism’ of numerical flexibility.
For many women and some men the culmination of the feminine discursive ideal finds expression in the subordination of self to the ‘needs’,
demands and desires of significant others, be they family members, friends,
superordinates, etc. (Davies 1990, 1994). Femininity, then, is an ideal that
in emphasizing acquiescence leaves little space for an active and autonomous subject who can place equal demands upon those whose labour and
identity are serviced by contemporary heterosexual arrangements. Lorraine
states:

[T]o connectedness, to the fusion experienced by fitting so closely to
the desire of an other that she feels that other’s desire as her own, thus
desiring what the other desires . . . She cares very little about the
pattern of social positions laid out by the Symbolic . . . She cares very
little about the ‘rational’ code for translating and transposing a particular self-identity through the position of the Symbolic. She attends
instead to the concrete specificity of the particular individuals in front
of her taking whatever shape they give her. It is fine with her if this is
within the socially acceptable parameters of the Symbolic. If not, she
is perfectly content to subvert those parameters.
(Lorraine 1990: 185)

In this sense, the feminine ideal is expressive of a ‘relational’ mode of
engaging with the world (Davies 1990, 1994). It is for this reason that the
phrase ‘no time to call our own’ has an immediate resonance for many
women. For unlike the projects prevalent within masculine discursive
configurations that have finite time scales in which measures of achievement can be imposed, ‘feminine’ work is unending and almost infinite in
its ceaseless circularity. Those whose identities are discursively constituted
as feminine invariably derive meaning, purpose and direction from their
embeddedness in embodied social relations (see Chapter 4). But while the
masculine self’s compulsive hyperactivity is motivated by the desire to
control self and ‘other’, the feminine self’s actions are motivated by a desire
for emotional validation. However, the discursive constructs of feminine
identity, as with masculine ways of being, are variously constituted through
narrative configurations of social time(s). The inherent narrativity of
feminine identities is evident when we reflect on the discourses of
self-sacrifice and sensual embodiment, which serve to constitute ideal
femininity (Rich 1977). Discourses of ideal femininity suggest meaning,
purpose and direction to be obtainable through sensitivity to the situationally contingent needs and desires of significant others. Embodied social
relations of this genre are predicated on continuous selfless engagement.
But this form of embodied social existence struggles to be realized in the


-----

146 Gender and work in capitalist economies

turnstile dynamic of just-in-time labour. Sennett’s (1998) seminal work
provides a means to illustrate these incongruences between feminine
relational time and the fragmented times of post-Fordist numerical
flexibility.
Sennett describes contemporary organizational culture as dominated by
the imperative of risks. But the contemporary culture of risk is peculiar ‘in
that failure to move is taken as a sign of failure, stability seemingly almost a
living death. Destination therefore matters less than the act of departure’
(1998: 87). But the aftermath of continuous risk-taking is a feeling of
anomie, of ‘meaningless success or the impossibility of reward for effort’
(1998: 91). A condition in which ‘the person in these toils becomes
prisoner of the present, fixated on its dilemmas’ (1998: 91). The emphasis
here on discontinuity unsettles the narrative self of feminine identity.
Those whose identities are discursively constituted as feminine invariably
derive meaningful existence, purpose and direction in terms of an
embeddness in embodied social relations developed in and through time.
While positioned in relation to power and space, feminine identities
emerge from a self-interpretation constituted through embodied social
relations. The feminine self is a developing site of sensual engagement and
embodiment. Conversely, the self of post-Fordist numerical flexibility is ‘a
pliant self, a collage of fragments unceasing in its becoming, ever open to
new experience’ (1998: 133). The erosion of organizational narratives
precipitates the corrosion of narrative identity as ‘there can be . . . no
coherent life narrative, no clarifying moment of change illuminating the
whole’ (1998: 133). The notion of the self as ‘a collage of fragments’,
clearly challenges the modernist discursive constructs of feminine identities.
But this disjuncture is also of relevance to masculine narrative time(s). This
is because the masculine desire for identity, through mastery, is premised
on an incessant desire to control the future. The rationalization of the
career into a teleological linear project is seductive in its promise of control.
But, as past experiences increasingly provide little guide to the present, the
‘Casino’ (Bauman 2001) culture of contemporary organizations suggest a
crisis for both feminine and masculine narrative identities.

Timely reflections

Sociologists have long since recognized the centrality of time to the labour
process, identity and subjectivity at work. Indeed, axiomatic to Max
Weber’s Protestant work ethic is a ‘worldly asceticism’ which rejects
immediate reward and imbues the subject with a relentless ethical and
individual responsibility for ensuring their long-term security (Sennett
1998: 105). E. Thompson (1967) argues that the rise of industrial capitalism
witnessed a transformation in the dominant ‘task-oriented’ temporal
consciousness, towards a greater synchronization of labour and more exact
time routines. These changes entailed the imposition (e.g., through official

timepieces) and eventual internalization of a specific ‘time orientation’ to
labour and life. Thompson is of course referring here to the self-imposed
rationalization of work time into homogenous blocks of linear time (Adam
1995). Theoretical challenges to the hegemony of linear time, have been
vociferous in their desire to reveal linear time as inextricably bound up
with relations of power (Thrift 1981, 1988; Hassard 1989; Nowotny 1992;
Adam 1994). Feminist challenges to linear time’s centrality to the productive economy have been no less dynamic in their critique (Davies 1990,
1994; Hakim 1991; Leccardi 1996; Fagan 2001). Significant distinctions
exist with regards to the foci of these feminist critiques. Within the area of
‘work time preferences’, feminists have sought to highlight and address
gender differentiation in employment scheduling (Hakim 1996; Rubery et
al. 1998; Boulin and Hoffman 1999; Fagan 2001). Here it is generally
argued that ‘the deregulated nature of the labour market combined with
the ‘‘breadwinner’’ ideology embedded in welfare state policies, channel
women with children into part-time work and men into very long fulltime hours’ (Fagan 2001: 241). A similar although significantly distinct
assertion is made by those feminists who focus on the production of
gendered time and subjectivity at work. These writers variously identify
the incompatibility of ‘women’s time’ with a linear perspective, which
separates work from leisure, the public from the private, and task from
clock-based orientations to time (Forman 1989; O’Brien 1989; Davies
1990, 1994; Leccardi 1996). Elsewhere I have argued that many of these
feminist challenges are epistemologically grounded in the very same
representational tradition, which has secured the hegemony of linear time
(see Chapter 5). For these feminist discourses tend towards either a strategy
of reversing the phallocentricity of linear time and/or synthesizing the
binary elements of their discourse (i.e., its male/female opposition) into
mutually inclusive dualistic pairs. The problem that unites these respective
strategies is that they fail to replace the dualistic epistemology that is at the
heart of Enlightenment thought.
The emergence of post-Fordist just-in-time labour in the current era
compounds the epistemological complexities of gendered time. For, the
current ‘flexible regime’ begets ‘a character structure constantly ‘‘in
recovery’’ ’ (Sennett 1998: 135). Conversely, feminine and masculine
identities indicate the existence of a conscious subject living in time and
capable of uniting the literal with the virtual or linking one temporal order
(the present) with others (the past and future). This chapter has been
concerned to draw attention to the complexities of narrative time as both
medium and context for the production of gender identity in the time/
space economy of just-in-time labour. Instrumental rationality, as a discursive construct of masculine identity, and managerialist organizational
discourses are radically challenged by the fragmented times of just-in-time
labour. As Bauman (2001: 128) states: ‘rational choice in the era of
instantaneity means to pursue gratification while avoiding the consequences and particularly the responsibilities which such consequences


-----

148 Gender and work in capitalist economies

imply’. Embodied social relations are no less suited to the extended present
of just-in-time production. Evidence of these complexities is provided in
recent surveys which suggest that both males and females would prefer
more ‘work/life balance’ (DTI 2003). Similarly, Fagan’s (2001: 260) study
of work time preferences has identified similarities between the sexes,
stating that ‘for both men and women the most popular labour market
developments would be more flexible hours, followed by earlier starts and
finishes, while night work is definitely unpopular’. One might suggest that,
given the findings of these respective studies, a concept of gendered time is
simply no longer relevant to the current era. But this would once again
involve oversimplifying a complex phenomenon. For example, Fagan
(2001: 260) further identifies how ‘the reasons why schedules were
inconvenient did, however, vary strongly with gender’, whereby ‘women,
particularly part-timers, frequently mentioned childcare problems and the
need to fit household chores into their day’. The tensions and contradictions emerging here reinforce the necessity of conceptualizing temporality in terms of multiplicity. In the writings of Henri Bergson, time is
defined as a ‘multiplicite´ indistincte ou qualitative’. Roughly translated,
our experience of time involve a multiplicity of interpenetration ‘and
organisation of elements, each one of which represents the whole, and
cannot be distinguished or isolated from it except by abstract thought’
(Bergson 1950, quoted in Breeur 2001: 181). Our experiences of time are
therefore not delineated into linear narrative versus post-Fordist fragmentation, but rather ‘simultaneity’ and ‘juxtaposition’ (Bergson 1950).
The concept of multiplicity is further substantiated by the suggestion that:

we do not live, after all once in a pre-modern, once in a modern,
once in a postmodern world. All three ‘worlds’ are but abstract
idealizations of mutually incoherent aspects of the single life-process
which we try our best to make as coherent as we can manage.
(Bauman 1992: 11)

One might conclude from Bauman’s proposition, a coexistence of narrative and post-Fordist times, simultaneously permeating everyday consciousness. In other words, a kind of synthesis and negotiation of
temporalities experienced through continuity and yet inextricably tied to
the particularity of context. This provides a means of theorizing gendered
relations to just-in-time labour beyond the epistemological problematics of
duality and alienation.

Note

part-time, compared with 43 per cent of female employees.’ Moreover,
women constitute around 69 per cent of administrative, personnel services and
customer service occupations while men constitute around 69 per cent of
managers, officials and skilled trade persons.

Capitalist accumulation in the global economy

In recent decades there have been unprecedented transformations in the
rhythms of capital circulation. ‘For the first time in history, the capitalist
mode of production shapes social relationships over the entire planet’
(Castells 2000: 471). Marx and Engels (1985: 37) had long since anticipated
that ‘the need of a constantly expanding market’ would chase ‘the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe’. Since the 1970s, flexibility has
developed as an efficacious adumbrate of capital accumulation. Flexible
accumulation has broken down the vertically integrated rigidities of Fordist
production. And this has been an integral condition for the transition to a
more technologically dynamic circulation of capital. In as much as capitalist
accumulation depends on the production of surplus value, the circuits
which capital travels ‘appear as the time of devaluation’ (Marx 1973: 538).
This is because the speed of circulation directly determines ‘the speed with
which the production process is repeated’ (1973: 538). Since this is the
case, the fundamental operation of the capitalist economy is to multiply
‘how often capital can be realized in a given period of time’ (1973: 538).
Indeed, businesses which fail to accelerate turnover time risk surrendering
their profits to competitors. Consequently capital must, on the one hand,
strive to eradicate spatial barriers to exchange and, on the other, strive to
‘annihilate this space with time, i.e., to reduce to a minimum the time
spent in motion from one place to another’ (1973: 593). The more
advanced the capital, the more predicated it is upon the continuous
expansion of market relations and the more it strives for ‘greater annihilation of space by time’ (1973: 539). To this extent capitalist accumulation
‘cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production’ (Marx and Engels 1985: 37). This translates into continuous


-----

152 Gender and work in capitalist economies

transformations in the modes of production as all fixed relations are swept
away and ‘all newly-formed ones become antiquated before they can
ossify’ (1985: 37).
Considered remuneratively, the laws of motion of capitalist development dictate a continuous revolution in circulation time. If one imagines
the ideal rate of capital circulation, the ‘velocity of circulation’ would be
absolute, ‘i.e., no interruption in production resulting from circulation’
(Marx 1973: 544). This would mean that circulation generated no delay,
and capital was able to immediately begin the repetition of the production
process. But this could only be enabled by ‘an increase in the forces of
production’ (1973: 545). Such economies of time are closely linked to the
acceleration and abbreviation of time in the 24-hour global economy.
Capitalist accumulation is increasingly built on a 24-hour economy of justin-time deliveries, compressed down time, round-the-clock retailing, real
time customer-facing and instant communications. Neoclassical economic
traditions regularly promote the benefits of unfettered flows of goods and
resources across national boundaries. With the expansion of flexible
accumulation, national economies have become integrated into a world
economy, driven by global streams of commerce and financial capital.
Alongside these global transformations, in the organization of capital, is
occurring a disaggregation of labour.
It is clearly evident that in the 24-hour global economy decentralized
production intensifies the systematic use of subcontracting as a mechanism
for ‘deskilling, wage depression and labour intensification’ (Taplin 1996:
192). This is because subcontracting establishes patterns of decentralized
production, in which firms can ‘export labor-intensive and low valueadded tasks’ to other firms integrated in a global hierarchical network
(1996: 192). Trends in the flexibilization of global production initially
mapped onto the ‘sequential transformation of goods-in-production from
low value-added activities to high value-added activities’ (Hoogvelt 2001:
137). The concept of value-added refers to ‘the market value of a firm’s
output minus the market value of the inputs it purchases from other firms’
(2001: 137). The notion of the value-added chain describes the transformations involved in the processing of raw material into a retailed finished
object. In economic terms the commodity-object becomes increasingly
more expensive as it proceeds through each stage of production. Each stage
in the value chain also represents a point of intervention in which capitalist
entrepreneurs can intervene and maximize the profitability of their service.
Consequently it has been recognized that ‘the concept of a value-added
chain expresses a sequential progression from lower value-added to higher
value-added activities’ (2001: 137). In the history of capitalist development, low value-added activities have been located in unskilled labour
markets (within the Third World). Conversely, high value-added activities
have been undertaken in labour markets closer to the final destination
consumer markets (the First World). Such patterns fitted with capitalism’s
need to construct sustainable consumer markets, capable of affording high

value products and thus staving off its tendency towards intermittent crises
in accumulation.
Advances in technology are radically disrupting traditional value chains.
It is now possible to divide up the value chain in new ways and ‘locate the
labour-intensive slices in the production of those goods traditionally
viewed as skill-, capital- or technology-intensive, in low-wage locations’
(2001: 138). In such circumstances flexibility means the speedy delivery of
goods in working conditions in which skill development is seen as a costly
and time-consuming luxury. Consequently:

The global division of labour is rendering a core–periphery relationship that cuts across national and geographic boundaries, bringing
on board, within the core, segments of the Third World and relegating segments and groups in both the traditional core of the system
and in the Third World to peripheral status. Core–periphery is
becoming a social relationship, no longer just a geographical one.
(Hoogvelt 2001: 138)

To this extent, globalization has been described as a new international
division of labour (Frobel et al. 1980). In academic circles it is defined by its
distinction from a previous international division of labour, associated with
the colonial period through to the late 1960s. It had been in the interest of
metropolitan colonial powers to establish and maintain an international
division of labour, which relied on colonies to produce raw materials for
factories located in Europe. This required a social revolution in forms of
indigenous domestic production, particularly in agriculture. Colonial settlers were largely responsible for the displacement of subsistence and semicommercial farming by the large-scale cultivation of commercial crops.
The invasion of capitalism into subsistence farming rapidly modernized
agricultural production but this was at the expense of increased social
differentiation and proletarianization. The subsistence farming systems that
the colonizers encountered were inhabited according to a distinct sexual
division of labour. Studies of women and economic development in precolonial societies, identify the widespread existence of farming systems
populated entirely by women. European settlers showed little regard for
the female farming systems they encountered in their newly acquired
colonies. Such disinclination was often brutal and destructive. Boserup
observes how in ‘parts of Africa, where female farming predominated,
women were eliminated by European-styled land reforms, and the land
was given to their husbands’ (1989: 60). European colonial administrators
clearly believed that ‘male farming ought to be promoted to replace female
farming’ (1989: 54). Consequently, the existing female agricultural labour
force was purposely neglected when colonial settlers introduced modern
technology and cash crops into agricultural production. Such developments exacerbated income differentials between the sexes. Cash crop
production attracted financial investment, while women were relegated to
subsistence farming and ‘continued with traditional low-productivity

154 Gender and work in capitalist economies

methods’ (1989: 56). The forfeiture of women’s right to land was clearly an
effect of the old international division of labour. Unfortunately, it is evident that women have fared little better in the new international division
of labour. In this system, technological advances enable transnational
corporations to disaggregate the value chain and export labour-intensive
processes to the developing world for production, and the final results are
then exported to the industrial heartland.
Offshore production has been linked to the accelerated growth of many
Third World economies but it has also created serious social dilemmas.
Biotechnology has empowered multinational agro-businesses ‘to package,
extend and redirect the . . . quality and content of the product’ (Arce and
Marsden 1993: 294). Indeed, the interconnections between global distribution channels and advanced biotechnology enable the production and
reproduction of freshness and naturalness over expansive distances of time
and space. Such developments have enhanced the control of multinationals
over indigenous farmers and precipitated the ‘proletarianization of indigenous and rural peoples who mainly relied on subsistence agriculture’
(Munoz 2004: 22). Alongside these changes has been an explosion of
female workers within the new international division of labour. This is
particularly apparent within the Export Processing Zones (EPZs), which
appeared as a consequence of the global spread of neoclassical liberalist
economic policies. EPZs are an aggregate of free trade zone and industrial
park, established to advance export-oriented industries. They are an
integral feature of global manufacturing, most especially because they
provide businesses with an abundance of low cost labourers. Businesses also
enjoy limited duties on both the importing of raw materials and exporting
of finished goods. These tax incentives are coupled with generous government subsidies on factory residence and unobstructed access to stateowned transportations systems. Consequently the free trade industrial
estates of EPZs are hugely attractive ventures for multinationals. But the
huge profit savings EPZs offer are achieved at a cost. It has been observed
that the majority of the employees in EPZs are female. This is partly
because women are the primary recruitment target for third party subcontractors. In these circumstances, factory owners are all too keen to play
on fallacious ideologies which define unskilled, standardized activities as a
natural extension of the roles women adopt in the domestic division of
labour (Mies 1996; Wichterich 2002). Indeed, a succession of highly
reputable studies have identified that ‘women endure super-exploitation in
factories that do not abide by the most minimum standards of worker
protection’ (Munoz 2004: 21). Consequently women find themselves
ghettoized in the most poorly paid, routinized enclaves of the new
international division of labour. Of particular concern is the experience of
women in the global textile industry.
This chapter argues that globalization precipitates the ‘spatial degradation’ of the production process. It is a disconcerting fact of contemporary
textile manufacturing that accelerated turnover gains have become

increasingly dependent on the exploitation of a spatially disaggregated,
feminized global assembly-line. This chapter is divided into three main
sections. The first section described globalization as an accentuation of the
time/space compression directly associated with flexible accumulation.
The second section theoretically examines gender and inequality in the 24hour global economy. The final section provides a case study of the
international clothing company Burberry and its closure of the Treorchy
textile factory in South Wales. In March 2007, this plant was closed and
production was relocated to Asia. It is reported that over 309 (mainly
female) workers were made redundant. The closure of the Treorchy plant
generated a spectacular global campaign and was the focal feature of the
Welsh Affairs Committee’s enquiry into ‘Globalization and Its Impact on
Wales’. The case study contains a detailed document analysis of parliamentary papers and witness evidence presented by Burberry to the Welsh
Affairs Committee in February 2007. The case study argues that the closure
of the Treorchy plant and the global disaggregation of production are
directly linked to the feminization of labour in the new international
division of labour.

The 24-hour global economy

Globalization refers to the intensification of worldwide processes integrating national economies through increasingly unfettered flows of
commerce, and financial capital across national boundaries. The tendency
for capitalist processes to converge in the production of a global market
place has been well observed. An international division of labour and
international market exchange accompanied the rise of industrial capitalism
in the eighteenth century. International trade accelerated the maturation of
capitalism in the early twentieth century. And even capitalism’s historic
post-1945 rapid decolonization forced newly independent nations into a
global economic order in which they were expected to adopt export-led
trade as a primary vehicle of fiscal development. Thus capitalism has a
legacy of global divisions of labour. Nevertheless, the deepening international connections of contemporary global processes suggest that we are
entering a new economic order driven by the powerful forces of financial
liberation, and the rapid diffusion of information technologies.
The 1970s marked the meteoric ascendancy of neo-liberalism and the
reduction of trade barriers separating industrial economies. In the United
Kingdom and the United States the economic nationalist agenda of the
post-war era gave way to the neo-liberalist ideals of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In the 1980s, further measures were
introduced geared towards curtailing tariffs and other barriers to the free
flow of trade between member nations. Neo-liberalism’s blueprint soon
extended into the fiscal policies of developing nations, most especially
because the G7 ascribed the World Bank and International Monetary Fund


-----

156 Gender and work in capitalist economies

(IMF) a more prominent role in global development policy. Since the mid1970s, the IMF has been providing developing countries with financial
assistance on concessional terms. These agreements initially took the form
of Trust Funds. Commencing in March 1986, concessional financial
assistance was enabled through the Structural Adjustment Facility, SAF
(IMF 2004). The concessional terms of SAF were geared to the implementation of supply-side fiscal polices which many low income member
countries adopted as part of the rubric of Structural Adjustment Policies
(SAPs). For these nations SAPs provided a mechanism to rescue them from
a crippling debt repayment crisis. In 1987, the apparent successes of SAPs
led to the emergence of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF). In due course ESAF evolved into a primary driving force of
globalization. This is because ESAF’s concessional terms emphasize the
overwhelming need for Third World nations to replace state-led importsubstitution with market-led export-substitution. ESAF also provided the
IMF with immense control over low income member countries and this
was a source of significant contention. In 1999, ESAF was replaced by the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The IMF describes this
as a ‘low interest lending facility for low income countries’ (IMF 2006).
PRGF is supported by the necessity for low income member states to
submit a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) as part of the IMF’s
concessional terms of finance assistance. It is intended that PRSPs will
produce a ‘country-led mechanism to more sharply focus countries’ poverty reduction efforts’ (2006). And this will be achieved by the adoption of
policies more closely focused on achieving ‘a full integration between the
poverty reduction and macroeconomic elements of the program, and
greater degrees of participation by civil society and national ownership,
which in turn would lead to more consistent policy implements’ (IMF
2004). But the PRGF continues to extol the imperative for developing
nations to accept the liberalization of trade and capital flows, as a condition
of economic advancement. As the IMF states:

The Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) remains the
IMF’s main facility for assisting low-income countries . . . The Fund
recently completed its review of the design of PRGF-supported
programs among the more economically stable low-income members
. . . The recent review confirmed the importance of macroeconomic
stability and openness for sustained growth. It highlighted the central
roles of private investment and exports, and also focused attention on
the importance of sound institutions.
(IMF 2005)

To this extent, free trade promises to stimulate economic development and
this is supposedly accentuated when market-led export-substitution drives
economic growth. This is because production and trade, predicated on
market-based exchange, are expected to generate larger economies of scale.
Likewise deregulated trade barriers advance ‘internal and external

competition’, as the unimpeded free mobility of goods stimulates technological development and labour market participation (Peterson and
Lewis 1999: 404). Conversely, critics of Third World market liberalization
accuse Western nations of hypocrisy. Western nations entice developing
economies to open their markets, while instituting restrictions on their
own barriers, thus, ‘preventing developing countries from exporting their
agricultural products and so depriving them of desperately needed export
income’ (Stiglitz 2002: 6). Consequently, free-trade policies are seen as
duplicitous in their principles of ‘comparative advantage’ when the primary
beneficiaries of export-led industrialization have been Transnational
Corporations (TNCs).
Alongside liberalization and the growth of global corporations has been
an unprecedented advance in the application of information technologies.
Revolutionary advances in IT have dramatically effaced the formidable
time and space barriers, which separated national markets. According to
Castells, a defining feature of global capitalism is that ‘agents in this
economy’ are fundamentally dependent ‘upon their capacity to generate,
process and apply efficiently knowledge-based information’ (Castells 2000:
66). It is self-evident that information and knowledge have always been
axiomatic to capitalist economies. But it is also evident that we are witnessing the evolution of an advanced technological paradigm configured
around new formidable information technologies. The information-driven
environment of global capitalism ‘makes it possible for information itself to
become the product of the production process’ (2000: 67). To this extent
capital has achieved an unprecedented mobility. Unlike ‘organized capitalism’ with its synchronous flows of capital and labour circulating on a
national scale, global capitalism is ‘disorganized’ (Lash and Urry 1994).
Fragmented, flexible production, indomitable networks of financial flows
now circulate on an international scale. In global capitalism, accumulation
proceeds and profit are generated ‘increasingly in the global financial
markets enacted by information networks in the timeless space of financial
flows’ (Castells 2000: 472). A revolution in information technology and a
dramatic restructuring of world capitalism have brought into being ‘a new
social structure, the network society; a new economy, the informational
global economy’ (2000: 472). Flows of commercial trade and financial
capital circulate globally irrespective of national boundaries. The velocity
of circulation now assumes unprecedented speed. Indeed, the application
of information technologies has dramatically reduced the cost of production internationally, thus linking ever-expanding markets into global
transnational networks. These innovations have tremendously advanced
the mobility of capital and shifted the impulse of business from the pursuit
of economies of scale, to an emphasis on economies of time.

The globalized woman

New technologies enable TNCs to set up decentralized production networks, by outsourcing to different parts of the globe. Outsourcing is a
generic term that refers to contracting out a precise function to another
business organization that specializes in that function. Such flexibilization
enables manufactures to minimize costs either by relocating standardized
labour-intensive portions of manufacturing processes to cheaper labour
markets or by ‘creating global electronic outworking in services that were
previously non-tradable’ (Peterson and Lewis 1999: 403). By decentralizing production networks globally, manufacturers externalize a vast proportion of the costs linked with the labour process.
Evidence also suggests that the global economy enables firms to achieve
production efficiencies, by subcontracting specialized functions to smaller
firms which ‘results in labour market segmentation between rather than
within firms’ (Taplin 1996: 192). This is because the post-Fordist pattern of
vertically integrated firms is being superseded by an organized pattern of
subcontracting to smaller firms ‘who remain dependent upon them in a
hierarchically structured network’ (1996: 192). The resulting interlocking
mesh of contracts and subcontracts creates a paradox in which flexible
accumulation is achieved alongside Fordist labour processes. Traditionally
decentralization was the preserve of deskilled tasks in inflexible industrial
plants. In the current era, technological advances make it feasible to
standardize complex operations ‘that previously were subject to the friction
of space and therefore regarded as non-tradable’ (Hoogvelt 2001: 135).
New technologies enable the transformation of complex immobile tasks
into portable, ‘real time’ activities. Firms can now relocate a, seemingly
unlimited, range of complex operations where cost-effective labour markets can guarantee profitability.
It is clear that women are the primary workers in the global economy’s
‘vertically disintegrated’ (Sayer 1989) methods of production. Women
constitute the majority of part-time and impermanent workers in developing countries (Chen et al. 2005: 9). TNCs actively encourage the
recruitment of young females in export-processing enclaves (Sklair 2002).
Plus, females achieve a lower rate of pay than their male counterparts. Such
observations concur with the feminization of poverty thesis. The focus
here is on the formal spaces of globalization and the exclusion of economic
and cultural spheres, associated with domestic labour, from the analysis of
the new international division of labour.
Feminist theorists have responded to gender exclusion by beginning
from ‘the informal spheres marginalised under global capitalism’ and using
this as ‘a strategic way to reveal how informal economies of production and
caring subsidize and constitute global capitalism through cheapening production in sweatshops and homework’ (2002: 261). In this body of work,
globalization is axiomatic to a new era of crises in capital accumulation. In
order to offset a crisis in accumulation, capital has engineered a global


-----

Women, work and inequality in the global assembly-line 159

restructuring of the labour process and encouraged a series of spatial displacements (from factory production to sweatshops and, more controversially, home working). Alongside these spatial displacements, global
capital has attempted to tether the tide of declining profitability through
ideological shifts, which have involved a transition ‘from family-wage
work to poorly paid feminized work’ (2002: 261). To this extent, feminists
have sought to highlight the significant role that cultural ideologies of
domestic labour, gender identity and sexuality play in defining the composition of the new international labour market. Maria Mies (1996: 358)
argues that the restructuring of the global economy, towards the direction
of export-led industrialization, has ‘created an enormous expansion of what
has been called the ‘‘informal sector’’ in rural and urban areas’. She argues
that ‘the exploitation and over-exploitation of women’s labour in this
informal sector, enable people in rich countries to buy inexpensive garments, handicrafts and year-round flowers, fruit and vegetables from Asia,
Africa and Latin America’ (1996: 358). Similar observations are evident in
Barrientos et al. (2004). A vast proportion of the employment in global
production is informal, non-contracted flexible work. During the Fordist
era, it was possible to clearly separate the labour market into distinct formal
and informal segments. Deregulated global production has blurred this
boundary and it is increasingly evident that there are ‘increasing numbers of
both men and women now employed in ‘‘informal’’ types of employment as
the share of secure permanent, full-time jobs declines throughout the world’
(2004: 1). The impact of gender and informal labour is further evident when
one considers global value chains. At the high-value ends of global value
chains, formal employment is a prominent feature. But this is less evident as
the supply end becomes more proliferated. At this lower end of the continuum contract labour and home workers pervade labour markets.
Women have a higher propensity than men to be concentrated in the
informal enclaves of global value chains. This is because the technology
used in decentralized production depends on the existence of labour
market differentiation among the skilled and unskilled (Balakrishnan 2002).
Firms downsizing and subcontracting to smaller operators create ‘labour
market segmentation between firms in networks’ (Taplin 1996: 192). The
extent to which this segmentation translates into gender segregation
depends on the distribution of skills between the sexes and the resilience of
prevailing labour law. Given that the compulsive logic of ‘vertical disintegration’ is towards the automation of high skilled, high paid jobs, the
emerging labour process tends towards a blend of work intensification and
low skilled batch production. Consequently, work in these markets ‘is
inevitably seen as part of secondary labour markets, with low pay, few
benefits, and little job security’ (1996: 197). Women are particularly overrepresented in these labour markets. This is because skill distribution is
often differentiated by sex. On a global scale, most subcontracted, labour
intensive work is carried out by women, who have historically been
marginalized from skill development and training. It is important,

therefore, to recognize that the continuous-flow infrastructure of the 24hour global economy is driven by a reservoir of female labour power. The
complexity of this gender dynamic is particularly intriguing when we
consider the global economies of time and space in contemporary clothing
production.

Women and the global assembly-line

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the clothing industry continued to be
predominated by female employees. It also continued to be characterized
by labour-intensive activities and low wages. This squeeze on salaries
enables companies to be profitable despite only investing a small capital
outlay. Pay conditions were further exacerbated by the method of piecework payment, and the application of scientific management in the form of
time and motion studies. Since the 1970s the most pervasive system of
payment, in the industry, has been ‘payment by results’, which establishes a
bench-mark ‘for each operation known in the trade as ‘‘the standard
performance’’ for each operation’ (Coyle 1984:8). This is operationalized
as the rate of output that a qualified worker would achieve, in the absence
of excessive exertion, over an average of the working period. Time and
motion studies aim to devise expedient procedures by which a garment can
be assembled. In accordance with Fordist operations, this involves breaking
down complex procedures and recreating them in a sequence of simple
operations ‘with a specific method established for each operation’ (1984:
9). From this schema evolved the system of progressive bundling, which
has since pervaded the textile industry’s basic operational technology.
Progressive bundle systems involve the gradual sequential assemblage of
garments as they are transferred through a succession of subassembly and
main assembly operations. Such processes have the advantage of being
stable systems with regards to the regularity of output. Nevertheless,
progressive bundle systems are extremely cumbersome in operation and
require vast quantities of work in progress. Increased levels of reliability are
achieved in straight-line or ‘synchro’ systems (Cooklin 2000). As indicated
by its name, this operating system is based on the synchronized flow of
work through each phase of the garment’s manufacture. Time and motion
studies are an essential component of this system because the synchro
system is inhibited if there are significant variations in the standard times
allowed for the entirety of operations performed in the assembly-line. This
system of work study provides management with detailed information
regarding the standard performance of employees. Management can access
performance rates over a working day or even over the duration of less
than an hour. It is invariably female workers who are subject to these acute
economies of time and motion. This is because enduring parallels exist
between the organization of the textile process in the nineteenth century
and its organization in Fordist and neo-Fordist production. But important

distinctions also need to be recognized. The twentieth century witnessed
the rise of fashion as signifying practice and the growth of the fashion
industry. By the 1970s, textile manufacture had to contend with accelerated cycles of fashion. It has been observed that seasonal fashion changes
meant ‘that long production runs [were] difficult to achieve and often
undesirable’ (Coyle 1984: 11). In response, manufacturers emphasized a
distinct form of flexibility. In contrast with the technical investments in
flexible accumulation, which has come to define globalization, textile
manufacturers achieved flexibility ‘though the flexibility of labour’ (1984:
11). In this era, low capital investment in machinery limited the flexibility
of production systems and their ability to be responsive to rapid market
changes. Consequently manufacturers placed emphasis on work intensification and the ‘flexibility of human labour’ (1984: 10). It was this form of
numerical flexibility which attracted a generation of female workers into
the textile industry. Throughout the twentieth century, female employees
provided the industry with ‘an irresistible combination of flexibility and
skill and cheapness’ (1984: 11).
In more recent times the textile industry has become increasingly
automated, particularly in Third World countries. Its primary activities
continue to consist of spinning, weaving and finishing, but these three
functions are frequently undertaken in integrated plants (Kyvik Nordas
2004). Technology is also functioning to enhance the integration of textile
and clothing. Both industries are inevitably closely related. Nevertheless,
technological developments have advanced this integration through
developments in vertical supply chains, and also in instituting progressive
distribution and sales activities. Examples of these developments include
the establishment of retail corporations, such as the US company, WalMart in the 1970s. Wal-Mart demanded that suppliers instrumented
information technologies to enable the exchange of sales data and insisted
that they adopted quality controls for labelling and handling material
(Kyvik Nordas 2004: 1). Such practices have spread throughout the textile
industry and have shifted the competitive advantage of suppliers from
production costs to ‘a question of costs in combination with lead time and
flexibility’. Indeed, it has been argued that ‘the textile and clothing sectors
can be seen as a supply chain consisting of a number of discrete [interrelated] activities’ (2004: 3). This is because the supply chain is transforming into an ‘integrated production network’ in which the production
process is ‘sliced into specialised activities and each activity is located where
it can contribute the most to the value of the end product’ (2004: 3). The
ensuing spatial disaggregation of textile production produces an economically powerful global core, from which manufacturing jobs flow eastwards.
Indeed, contemporary textile production involves the creation of Export
Processing Zones spread throughout the global periphery, where labourintensive factories produce clothing for exportation back to the core (HuDehart 2003: 246). In this new global economy, ‘finance capital from the
global core flows unfettered across international borders, to locate sources

of cheap labor where eager local elites in control of pliant states act as
‘‘middlemen’’ to facilitate what is euphemistically termed global economic
integration’ (2003: 246).

Case study – Burberry’s Treorchy Factory, 1988–2007

While writing this chapter, my attention has been drawn to a pertinent
illustration of the relationships between multinational textile corporations
and spatially disaggregated feminized labour markets. In September 2006,
the international clothing company Burberry announced the closure of its
factory at Treorchy, in Rhondda, in the heart of South Wales. Just weeks
previously Burberry had reported that:

In the financial year to 31 March 2006, the Group generated total
revenue of £743m across its retail, wholesale and licensing channels.
For that period, the Group estimates the total retail value of products
sold bearing the Burberry brand was in excess of £2.7 billion.
(Burberryplc.com 2007: 1)

Nevertheless, in March 2007, the plant at Treorchy was closed and 309
(mainly female) workers lost their jobs. The factory had been producing
clothing since 1939 and was assimilated into the Burberry emporium in
1988. Established in 1856, Burberry has a compelling reputation for the
production of luxury British designer apparel. Burberry markets itself to
this effect, its website promotion states that ‘The brand has a rich heritage
associated with Britain’ (Burberryplc.com 2007: 1). Burberry’s headquarters are based in London, and this is the central location of its supply
chain management activities. Burberry employs approximately 2000 people in the UK, 600 of whom are engaged in the manufacturing of its
iconically ‘British’ polo shirts and trench coat. Treorchy produced 25 per
cent of Burberry’s polo shirt range with the rest manufactured in Portugal,
Turkey and Asia. Here and elsewhere, Burberry epitomizes the growth of a
more integrated global textile industry. Ever since the 1990s, Burberry has
repositioned its manufacturing strategy in order to develop an international
brand. Following the appointment, in 1997, of a new CEO (Rose Marie
Bravo) Burberry began reversing its previous strategy of licensing its brand.
Up until this time Burberry had licensed its trademark to countries, such as
Hong Kong, Singapore and Spain, instead of owning its retail stores and
investing in the development of its brand. With the appointment of Rose
Marie Bravo, Burberry embarked on the shrewd move of purchasing all its
licenses so that the company could retain control over the development of
the brand and manufacturing processes. Axiomatic to this strategy was the
use of technology to streamline the supply chain and consolidate manufacturing operations.
The intrinsic technology of clothing production has changed little over
the past century. Production technology is still widely organized according

a progressive bundle operating systems. Although advances in the systematizing of operations have reduced the time and motion of each
operation, the basic system embodies a work design which employs low
skilled workers to perform simplified tasks to produce standardized products. While it is evident that basic technology is consistent with the
mechanized systems of Fordism, advances in information technology have
improved efficiency at each stage and streamlined the interface between
them (Kyvik Nordas 2004). To this extent, firms have been able to escape
the rigidities implicit in Fordism and adopt ‘flexible production systems
that are better suited to fluctuating demand, the need for shortened product development time, and competition based on quality rather than
price’ (Taplin 1996: 192). These innovations are best suited to the global
market place in which ‘production runs are short and flexibility means
speedy delivery of goods to market’ (1996: 193). On 27 February, Burberry’s Chief Executive (Angela Ahrendts), its Director of Corporate
Affairs (Michael Mahony), Chief Financial Officer (Stacey Cartwright) and
its Chairman (John Peace) addressed the Welsh Affairs Committee and its
Chairman (Hywel Francis). Burberry was asked to address the Welsh
Affairs Committee as part of its 2007 enquiry into Globalization and its
Impact on Wales. The Committee had started obtaining oral evidence in
January 2007 and by February 2007; it had begun examining the impact of
globalization on employment in Wales. A principal focus here was the
relocation of work and ‘the impact of eastern and southern Asia on
manufacturing and services industries in Wales’ (Welsh Affairs 2007).
Consequently the closure of the Treorchy factory coincided with the
Welsh Affairs Committee’s major enquiries and it stands to reason that
senior members of the Burberry Corporation were summoned to address
the committee.The issue of global supply chains was raised as part of
Burberry’s defence testimony. More specifically, it was stated that:

It is the quality of the manufacturing process as well as the quality of
the finished garment, so what we have been able to do is to significantly upgrade the fabric, upgrade the dying and washing facilities
to decrease the shrinkage, upgrade the trim, so we are able to give the
consumer a much higher quality product . . . at a significantly reduced
cost. From the supply chain perspective as well, with the suppliers that
we are using, they are what we call wholly vertical suppliers: they do
20 different processes, if you will, from sourcing yarns to laser printing
et cetera, whereas our facility in Treorchy really just does one or two
services. As we continue to grow the business – we are getting quite
large – we really need to consolidate with wholly vertical suppliers
worldwide.
(Parliamentary Papers 2007: 5)

It is also evident that lean production requires increased capital investment.
This imposes financial constraints on manufacturers, which can either be
absorbed (thus producing reduced profit margins), passed up the supply

chain, displaced by contracting lead times or displaced by relocating
manufacturing to lower cost countries. It would appear that Burberry’s
decision to close the Treorchy factory is a response to price-based competitive pressures and the need to adopt flexible systems to reduce production costs. In advance of its scheduled appearance in front of the Welsh
Affairs Committee, Burberry submitted a memorandum. It contained an
official statement, which declared that the September 2006 announcement
of closure was precipitated by a year-long review of Burberry’s supply
chain and manufacturing process. Burberry had concluded from the review
that:

Treorchy was not commercially viable and that as a number of other
clothing retailers have also found, it is now possible to source certain
products of greater quality overseas at a significantly lower cost, from
suppliers who will nearly always take on the complete management,
purchase, production and distribution requirements.
(Burberry 2007: 2)

The memorandum further stated that the year-long review had investigated ways in which the complex supply chain could be improved and
standardized. However, ‘there was found to be no case for re-equipping
Treorchy to make different items when capacity exists elsewhere in the
UK and Europe’ (2007: 2). On this basis Burberry decided to relocate
production to ‘other existing and more competitive sources of supply in
the European Union and Asia’ (2007: 2).
But there is considerable contention as to whether Burberry was actually
losing money. Representatives of the General Municipal and Boilermakers
(GMB) union have since calculated that the Treorchy factory was making
Burberry £22m a year. GMB estimates that a polo shirt cost £11 to
produce at the Treorchy factory and it was making 600,000 of these a year
at an average minimum retail price of £55. According to the GMB this
‘equates to about £30 million revenue’ (Parliamentary Papers 2007: 33).
They further argue that ‘If you take the manufacturing costs and the
overheads costs, which come to about £7.2 million, that still leaves a hefty
profit of somewhere around £22 million to £23 million’ (2007: 33). The
GMB are adamant that these calculations showed that ‘the factory was
viable’. However, Burberry presents an alternative calculation, which
factors in the cheaper production costs of polo shirts in China, i.e., £4 per
unit. When pressed about the overall savings that will be achieved by
relocating the Treorchy plant, Burberry’s Chief Financial Affairs Officer
stated that:

There was a transfer price that was being paid internally by our
merchandising division to acquire the product from Treorchy; that
transfer price was not sufficient to cover the extra costs at the location
and therefore in local terms we were still generating a manufacturing
loss of £1.5 million. By then being able to source the polo shirts at a

more affordable rate and add to the quality, there will be somewhere
around £3 million worth of benefits on top.
(Parliamentary Papers 2007: 14)

Thus keeping the Treorchy factory open would result in financial losses of
£3m a year. This version of financial loss and profit is peculiar to global
capitalism’s political economies of time and space. I shall substantiate this
contention in the following discussion.

Wage negotiations in global times

Global cultural processes are entering our daily lives and presenting formidable pressures for ‘individuals and groups and even national governments, to conform to international standards of price and quality’ (Hoogvelt
2001: 134). To this extent, global competition introduces into our consciousness a ‘shared phenomenal world’ (2001: 134). Media coverage, and
even our own global interpersonal relationships, make immediate the
competitive environment of global capitalism. We internalize these conditions and develop a reluctant appreciation of the trials, and tribulations, of
TNCs. Our attention is even more aroused by media coverage of local
financial crises precipitated by global market processes. Evidence of this
process was particularly apparent in the redundancy negotiations between
the GMB and Burberry. The GMB consistently emphasized that the closure of the Treorchy branch would have a devastating impact on the local
community. As Mervyn Burnett (Senior Officer with GMB) stated in his
witness testimony to the Welsh Affairs Committee:

Mrs James: I would like to turn to the effects of the planned closure of
Treorchy. You describe the impact of the closure as ‘devastating’ for
the local community. What is being done to mitigate the effect of this?

Mr Burnett: It has been extremely difficult. Burberry has been the
largest employer in the Rhondda Valley for many, many years. Even
when it was Polikoffs and Burberry took it over in 1987, there were
over 309 people employed there.
