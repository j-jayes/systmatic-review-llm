###### Introduction

I have been conscious, at times, of writing against the weight of
prevailing orthodoxies....

I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the Luddite cropper,
the "obsolete" hand-loom weaver, the "utopian" artisian, and even
the deluded follower of Joanna Southcott, from the enormous
condescension of posterity.1

With minor changes, E. P. Thompson's introduction to his classic
work on the English working class would make a fitting opening for
H. Clare Pentland's seminal study of the emergence of the Canadian
industrial working class. He too broke with the prevailing orthodoxies,
not only of North American labour studies but also of Canadian eco¬
nomic history, to produce a work of enduring influence.

In the first place, Pentland too seeks to rescue the anonymous
labourer from the neglect of historians who have devoted their energies
to the exploits of the ruling elite. As he notes himself in the introduc¬
tion to his first influential article published in 1948, "The Lachine Strike
of 1843":2

Historians have paid considerable attention to the English capital
that made possible Canada's canal and railway building in the
eighteen-forties and fifties, and some attention, too, to the
Scottish contractors who supervised the work. But there has been
almost complete neglect of the real builders of Canadian public
works, the thousands of labouring men, mainly Irish, who toiled
with pick and shovel at a time when the application of power
machinery to construction had scarcely begun.

But while the Irish labourers remain a focal point of this present
volume, Labour and Capital in Canada, 1650-1860, a slightly revised version
of his thesis, "Labour and the Development of Industrial Capitalism in
Canada",3 he ranges much further afield. Beginning in the seventeenth


-----

labour supply in Canada, encompassing early slavery; indentured and
convict labour; pre-industrial, "personal labour" of the French period
(which he initially called "feudal labour"4); the non-Irish worker and
the skilled artisan as well as the labourer. Perhaps more importantly
the scope was expanded to include the critical process by which the
mass of immigrants and native born were transformed into a modern
industrial working class with the emergence of a capitalist labour
market.

Secondly, this focus on the workingman in pre-Confederation
Canada pointed in a different direction from what was up to that time
the overwhelming preoccupation of Canadian economic historians: the
great staple trades and the political institutions that emerged from
these trades.5 Nevertheless it is misleading to imply, as some current
interpreters do, that Pentland turned his back on the staple interpreta¬
tion of Canadian history. Clearly, he did not, as he argues himself:

Commercial capitalism has been ... a system that asked remarkably
few questions about the method of production of the goods in
which it dealt. It could readily integrate slave societies, feudal socie¬
ties and incipient capitalist societies into its structure. It is not
apparent that the European settlers of Canada were prohibited
in any absolute sense from arranging production upon a basis of
slavery, or upon a basis of small-scale capitalism: European settlers
elsewhere had chosen such courses.... The basis of choice of
method in Canada's case (and in the other cases) lay in the nature
of the supply of, and demand for, labour.6

Thus, rather than ignoring staples or, even more incongruously,
being credited with opposing the commercial capitalist interpretation
of Canadian history associated with the staple interpretation, Pentland
began his work by studying the organization of labour in the period of
the staple trades. But as he points out (and as Buckley in another con¬
text has also argued7), the commercial capitalist interpretation of
Canadian economic development becomes increasingly less convincing
or applicable by the second half of the nineteenth century, particularly
as it relates to the labour market.

The tasks of the thesis are to delineate the feudal organization of
labour as it appeared in various Canadian employments up till
about 1850, and to trace the transformation that produced a capi¬
talistic labour market and a well-developed capitalistic economy
shortly after 1850.®

It is in the context of this changed focus of interest that Pentland had
his greatest impact upon the course and direction of studies of Canadian


-----

This can be ascribed to the fact that his thesis has remained unpublished
for two decades although it has circulated fairly widely in manuscript
form.9 In addition, some of the important elements developed in this
work were presented in article form before the complete work was
presented.10

It was with the revival of interest in political economy, labour and
Marxism in the 1970s in Canadian universities that Pentland's work
and his approach began to acquire the stature and attention that would
be revealed when, on his death, issues of three academic journals were
dedicated to his life and work.11 The basis of this reputation lay in the
originality of his approach and of his subject in relation to the existing
body of Canadian economic history. In recent years this situation has
changed markedly and at least part of the credit resides with Clare
Pentland.

###### The Man and His Work

The apparent break with the Innisian tradition centred in the University
of Toronto, or with the hinterland response associated with Saskatche¬
wan, was just one of the intellectual idiosyncracies that have been
credited to Pentland. Although born and raised in the agricultural west,
his initial preoccupation was with the central Canadian industrial
worker. While the Laurentian School concerned itself with commercial
trade, transportation and resources, Pentland concerned himself with
local industry and the anonymous worker rather than the ruling elite.
While the limited field of labour studies concentrated on labour or¬
ganizations and the regulation of industrial conflict, Pentland was
concerned with the labour process by which the working class and its
pre-capitalist progenitors were propagated, shaped,-moulded, disci¬
plined, skilled, allocated and rewarded, and how the worker responded
to the dehumanizing progression of the impersonal labour market.
And in the repressive political atmosphere of the Cold War, Pentland
incorporated the analytic approach of British Marxist historians.

Kealey has noted that "although Pentland's work stands apart starkly
from the Toronto political economy tradition, there are no clear ex¬
planations for this in his intellectual biography."12 Perhaps there is little
to explain these apparent contradictions in Pentland's interests and
approaches in his academic training but this is not the case in his per¬
sonal background. Clare Pentland was born October 17,1914, on a farm
near Justice, Manitoba, a town some ten miles north-east of Brandon.
His father was a farmer, later a trucker, his mother a school teacher.
The Pentland family, however, were not recent immigrants to Canada.
Clare's great-great grandfather, an Ulster-Scot hand-loom weaver,
emigrated to Canada from County Down in Ireland in 1821, settling


-----

dual vocations of farmer and weaver.13 His son, John, continued the
agrarian-artisan tradition, becoming a carpenter. In fact, he built his
father a hand loom that still exists, residing in the Royal Ontario
Museum. In 1843, the family moved to homestead in the Huron Tract,
eight miles north of Goderich.

John's son (Clare's grandfather), Thomas, continued the westward
move to the frontier, homesteading near Justice in 1881 where he com¬
bined farming with blacksmithing. This was the limit of the westward
movement. The Pentland family became well established in the Elton
municipality around Justice and a Pentland has been reeve of the area
for a good part of its political history. It was there that Clare's father
grain-farmed and began his trucking business. While Clare was still a
child, his family moved to Brandon to develop the business, largely in
shipping cattle to the packers. What is striking about this family back¬
ground is the overlay with Pentland's intellectual interests — his con¬
cern with the Irish and Scottish immigrant to central Canada in the
nineteenth century and with the artisan and industrial worker.

There are other aspects of Pentland's family background that ob¬
viously influenced his perspective. As Ulster-Scots, the family had a
strong historic connection with the Orange Order (Clare's uncle was
a member), a fact that no doubt contributed to Pentland's sympathetic
###### interest in the Order in the nineteenth century. Allied with this
heritage was a staunch Conservatism and, particularly in his mother
a strict Weslyan Methodism, both of which Clare was to rebel against
at a fairly early age. But the rebellion was within the tradition of the
social gospel movement of western Canada, humanitarian, left- inclined
and concerned with the welfare of the workers. This Clare revealed
both in his academic work and in his own actions.

Clare grew up in Brandon, graduating from the Collegiate in 1931
and the Brandon Normal School in 1933. This was followed by three
years of teaching in small country school houses at Whirlpool, a soldier
###### settlement area near Clear Lake, and at Ericson. Here he saw the in¬
tense poverty of the depression-wracked prairies, an experience which
strongly influenced his critical approach to contemporary society. He
###### returned to university in 1936 and four years later, in 1940, graduated
with a B.A. in Economics from Brandon College after receiving the
University of Manitoba Gold Medal in Arts and Science, the Ephraim
Buckwold Gold Medal in Economics and Silver Medals in History,
Political Economy and general proficiency. While he attended university
he worked as an attendant at the Brandon Mental Hospital, at least
until the summer of 1939 when he tried to organize the employees into
a staff association, an activity for which he was summarily fired by the
provincial government. It was also at the hospital that he met a young
nurse Harriet Brook who was later to become his wife The following


-----

###### summer found him working as a brakeman on the CPR running
between Brandon and Broadview, beginning, as with many westerners,
a lifelong love of the railway — though not necessarily of the CPR.

The outbreak of war did not immediately interrupt Pentland's re¬
newed educational program. From 1940 to 1942, he attended the
University of Oregon where he obtained his Masters.14 The direction
of his interests is indicated by the subject of his thesis, "The Adequacy
of Unemployment Benefits in Oregon". Perhaps more influential was
his teacher and, subsequently long-term friend, Louis A. Wood, best
###### known in Canada as author of A History of Farmers' Movements in Canada.
What is interesting is the similarity in Wood s background to Pent-
land s, particularly the Southern Ontario protestant heritage and,
###### though greatly supplemented by theological studies, the bridging of history and economics.15 Wood taught labour economics and courses
in socialism which may have provided Pentland with the background
in European Marxist scholarship.16 Possibly more important was
Wood's activity during the depression on the Oregon Unemployment
Commission and in support of Roosevelt's "New Deal". In fact, in his
###### reform and pro-labour and farmer sentiments he also represented the
social gospel tradition.17

Almost immediately after completing his thesis in the early summer
of 1942, Pentland enlisted in the Army and while undergoing training
in British Columbia married Harriet in the fall of 1942 in Vancouver.
###### After officer training near Victoria and artillery training at Brandon
and Brockville, he went overseas in February of 1944 where he was
###### transferred to the infantry as an education officer. He returned to
Canada and to university, this time at Toronto, in the spring of 1946,
###### under the veterans assistance program and by 1948 completed all the requirements but the thesis for his Ph.D. At Toronto he felt the full
influence of the Innisian and Toronto tradition18 and although he had
already chartered his direction toward labour studies, he was no
doubt directed towards the historical approach. He lectured briefly at
Toronto, from 1947 to 1949, before returning to his native province as
Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Manitoba in
1949. He remained at Manitoba for the remainder of his career.

But the completion of his thesis did not progress quickly. In part this
may have been the result of attempting too much. Certainly, he was
continually advised to narrow and confine his topic. Initially (1947)
he picked as his topic "A History of Labour in Canada to 1867", but
within a year this had been narrowed to "A Study of Canadian Labour
(Organized and Unorganized), in the Period 1830-1860". By 1951, it
was still further narrowed to "The Irish Labourers on the Canadian
Canals and Railways, 1830-1860". Yet when the thesis was finally pre¬


-----

most ten years later, it had again been broadened more or less to the
scope of his original proposal. Even at that, Pentland never considered
the thesis "complete". But completion was also slowed by his quest for
perfection, in part indicated by the copious and detailed footnotes to the
thesis, but which also extended to his writing and his teaching. Finally,
however, and at the urging of his supervisors, the thesis was presented
and defended late in 1960 and the degree conferred in 1961.

It is apparent from this brief biographical sketch that much of what
initially appears as intellectual idiosyncracy originated not in academic
influences but in his personal background, particularly his Irish-artisan-
immigrant ancestry, his strict Methodist upbringing, and his exposure
to poverty and the authoritarianism of employers. But what of the
academic or intellectual influences that led him away, both in subject
and methodology, from the prevailing Canadian school of political
economy? Wood may have had, as already indicated, some influence.
But according to his family, Harold Innis was the most influential
person in Pentland's intellectual development. Yet, as already men¬
tioned, his work did break with the staple tradition despite some recent
###### attempts to place Pentland back in the mainstream.19
 One might suggest two aspects in which his approach was similar to
the Toronto staple school. First, of course, was the historical approach
to the Canadian economy which relegated abstract and partial equili¬
brium theorizing to a decidedly minor role20 and which adopted a
strongly interdisciplinary approach to economic history.21 Secondly,
Pentland was fascinated with the impact of technology, and Innis,
###### after all, was preoccupied not with staples per se, but rather with tech¬
nology, a preoccupation which led to visits to observe in detail the
physical and technical conditions in the industry he was examining.22
But in most of the staple literature there is little or no attention paid to
the question of class — with the possible exception of the merchant
class, especially in the work of Creighton — and particularly with the
working people, a neglect which weakens the analytic power of the
staple model increasingly after the eighteenth century.23 Pentland's
work, on the other hand, concentrates on exactly this question. At the
same time, he was more concerned in this thesis with the question of
the emergence of a working class in itself (that is, the creation of a class
of workers alienated from ownership of land and capital, a working
class objectively defined by its relation to the means of production)
###### rather than with the question of a working class for itself (the creation
of a class-conscious, politicized stratum of workers), though he was to
direct more attention to the latter question in some of his later work.

It is not clear how Pentland became exposed to and influenced by
what Kealey calls "the English Marxist tradition of historical writing"24


-----

with its use of class as the fundamental tool of political-economic analy¬
sis and its concern with the role of the state in capitalistic transforma¬
tion and accumulation. Obviously he became familiar quite early with
Marx and the writings of other leading Marxists, particularly Maurice
Dobb, and he utilized the works of Dobb, Hobsbawm, Thompson and
###### others in this tradition quite freely in his teaching. On the other hand,
Pentland never considered himself a Marxist despite the fact that some
contemporary analysts have so characterized him (much to the surprise
of his own family). Indeed he even avoided the label of socialist. He joined
no political party although his sympathies lay with the CCF and later
the NDP, but even then not necessarily with the left wing of the Party.
His remained, throughout, an inconoclastic and independent mind.

Perhaps this is the real clue to his reputation as an intellectual ra¬
dical. He was an independent thinker who rebelled against the
constraints of any orthodoxy, Marxist, Methodist or Conservative.
But given his interest in studying his own roots and the history of
Canadian labour, he adopted the methodology and analytic tools most
suited to the task, the study of the labour process and the making and
shaping of the Canadian working class. This would lead automatically
to the Marxist historical tradition which has been the only tradition in
which this process has occupied a central and, indeed, critical place.

It is worth noting in this regard that Marxism can be both an
analytic framework and a political commitment (what Bry^an Palmer
has in a similar context called an engaged history).25 The former does not
necessarily imply the latter. It is possible, though perhaps not that
common, to use Marxian concepts of class and labour process to ana¬
lyze the evolution of the capitalist economic system without requiring
a commitment to the goals associated with the abolition of the capita¬
list wage system. Class and process are powerful tools for the critical
investigation of the capitalist system even where the purpose is the
limited one of humanizing and liberalizing that very system.26

What this suggests is that Pentland's dialectic approach to the
evolution of the Canadian labour market was not rooted in an adher¬
ence to radical scholarship but rather the reverse —that his radical
###### interpretation was the result of his choice of topic. This is indicated in
the introduction to one of his articles:

It has been the custom of economists since the Mercantilists to
assume the existence of a capitalist labour market. It appears that
this abstraction was adopted, not from ignorance of labour
conditions ... but because it simplified the economists' main task,
as they conceived it, of expounding how a capitalist economy
works. The abstraction had the disadvantage, however, of diver-


-----

»

ting attention from how a capitalist labour market might develop.*
This question, besides its historic and sociological interest, is rele¬
vant to the study of labour markets and of "economic develop¬
ment".27

Since he defined economic development in terms of systemic changes
in the labour market, and argued that these changes result from "capital
accumulation, importation and investment"28, the obvious dialectic pro¬
cess of accumulation is made clear.

If this line of argument is correct, therefore, Pentland was not in the
conventional sense a "Marxist" but rather an independent and origi¬
nal scholar who did not disdain any tradition, but whose own
Canadian analysis coincided rather well with the radical or Marxist
tradition in European and even American scholarship.

Pentland's analysis rests on one major theoretical premise. The
organization of production in society (and hence the behaviour
###### patterns imposed on members of society) follows from "the nature of
the supply of, and demand for, labour."29 Changes in supply and
demand conditions, therefore, invite social change. Hence the investi¬
gation of economic transformation begins with the study of labour
market conditions. The determinants of supply and demand
conditions are complex and non-mechanistic, however, and encom¬
pass both quantitative and qualitative variables. Demography, tech¬
nology, skill levels, economic stability, migration, social and cultural
###### patterns of the work force all became grist for his mill. But in the
1960s, Pentland increasingly turned his attention to historical demo¬
graphy and in particular the relation between labour supply and
economic change in Britain.30 In part this was a natural extension of
his work on Canada, but it was also stimulated by contact with British
economic historian Peter Mathias.31 In 1962-63, Pentland spent a
sabbatical in Cambridge, England. Again, in 1969-70, he spent a
sabbatical in England, this time at the University of Sussex working
on parish population studies. Unfortunately, failing health prevented
him from completing this work and further refining and developing
the ideas introduced in his 1965 paper to the Third International
Conference on Economic History in Munich.32

Despite his pursuit of historical demography in the 1960s, Pentland
was also able to research and write his second major and influential
unpublished manuscript, "A Study of the Changing Social, Economic,
and Political Background of the Canadian System of Industrial Rela¬
tions", commissioned by the federally-appointed Task Force on Labour

Relations under the chairmanship of Professor H.D. (Bus) Woods.33
Its limited circulation in mimeographed form is unfortunate because
his report remains one of the most original, innovative and compre¬
hensive investigations of the history of Canadian industrial relations.
Yet in spite of its all-encompassing scope in both time and subject
###### matter indicated in its title, it was completed in a couple of years, a far
cry from the thirteen or so taken to complete the thesis. In style and
form it differed greatly from the meticulous, detailed and documented
history of his thesis, its main thrust being painted in broad and bold
strokes. Yet curiously it represents a continuation of the central
investigation of his earlier work, albeit with a much heavier emphasis
on the development of the institutions and legal framework of indus¬
trial relations. Again what makes this work stand apart from the main
body of institutional labour in Canada is the concentration on the
dynamic interaction between the economy, the unions, the state and
technological change.

The 1960s were intensely productive years for Pentland. In addition
to his population research and Task Force report, he also pursued his
###### interest in technological change, producing three major reports for
both provincial and federal agencies on skills, training and technolog¬
ical change34 plus a number of lesser reviews on related issues.

###### Unfortunately, this level of intellectual activity could not be main¬
tained. Heart problems plagued the last ten years of his life, robbing
him of his stamina, a terrible frustration for a man so dedicated to his
teaching and his work. Yet despite this he shouldered a heavy admini¬
strative load in university affairs, as a member of Senate from 1963 to
1966 and again from 1969 to 1976, and as a member of the Board of
Governors representing the Senate from 1973 to 1976. He also served
on numerous university and Faculty Association committees35 as well
as continuing to teach, write and research. Two articles (published
posthumously) and two reviews were the primary academic output of
###### the 1970s,before his premature death on October 13, 1978.36

 Pentland and the Study of the Labour Process

In recent years Pentland's work has received increasing attention,
partly as a result of a renewed interest in the nineteenth century, in
particular the transformation of Canada from a commercial to an
industrial economy which involves the question of the nature of the
###### emergent Canadian state (the "national question"); and partly because
of a renewed interest in the related question of the evolving nature of
the organization and character of work (the labour process), both
issues which are central to Labour and Capital in Canada, 1650-1860. It is
###### important to understand these key dimensions to his work in order to


-----

appraise the contribution of this thesis to more recent research and
scholarship.

The labour process, simply defined, is how labour is applied to raw
materials, in conjunction with given tools and technology, to produce
###### output of use and market value. While such a definition appears rela¬
tively straightforward, the real-life process is not. This is made clear
by other definitions or approaches. One source defines labour process
as "work as a system of power", thereby emphasizing relationships at
the work place; while another emphasizes technology and technolo¬
gical change with the resulting consequences for the "nature of work,
the composition (and differentiation) of the working class, the psy¬
chology of workers, the forms of working class organization and
struggle, and so on."37 As Pentland has noted:

A fundamental problem of any society is the organization of its
labour force for production. If the society is to survive as an en¬
tity, ways must be evolved or devised to maintain or increase the
labour force, to determine the nature and extent of the division of
its labour force (the techniques to be used), and to establish and
enforce the system of incentives. The solutions of these problems
fasten their appropriate behaviour patterns upon the various
members of each society.38

Thus the organization of work far transcends the normal micro¬
concerns of technical economics with its preoccupation with technical
efficiency, to include the social structure of society as an ongoing system.
This is a basic key to understanding the importance of Clare Pentland's
approach.

A second key to understanding this approach is to recognize that
the labour process is not part of a stagnant equilibrium system but a
constantly evolving and changing one, responding to both purposeful
and unplanned change. This is the sense of what Thompson was try¬
ing to convey in his English study, the making of the working class. It is
impossible to take a snapshot of working people at a point in time
and then to objectively characterize a working class and its institu¬
tions at that point. They are in constant flux as are society and the
economic forces acting on society. It is this concern with change that
separates Pentland from the dominant American school of labour
historians who tended to fix upon the institution of the (business)
trade union as the apotheosis of labour activity, thereby neglecting all
the other manifestations of working-class activity which reflect the
workingman's response to his changing milieu.39

Is it possible to identify the critical elements in Pentland's world of
work that interact to produce the changes he describes? The obvious
starting point of his analysis is with supply and demand for labour. But


-----

this is not the mechanistic supply and demand for labour of the neo¬
classical equilibrium labour market. The supply and demand for
labour do not just determine the level of wages and employment (al¬
###### though they do that, too); they determine the very system by which
labour is organized to produce. That is, they determine the nature of
the labour process.40

###### There are, of course, complicating (or perhaps one should say other
interactive) factors, the most important of which are technology and
###### the skill level of the workers. These are not independent. As long as
technology was imbedded in the skills of the artisan, the work force
exhibited a skilled-unskilled dichotomy that influenced the very basis
of social organization and consequently the institutions of the work¬
ingman. This is a very important variable not only in the thesis but
also in the Task Force report. As long as work processes were depen¬
dent on the skilled worker, the working class remained divided by a
social and economic gulf that was reflected in both attitudes and insti¬
tutions. The period covered in the thesis coincided with the period
when the differentiation between skilled and unskilled was most
manifest, before the introduction of large-scale industrial capitalism
###### with its routinized and homogenized labour force. Pentland was to
take up this second transformation in the Task Force report.

His first concern was with the evolution of a capitalistic labour
market in Canada — that is, the transition from personal (or feudal)
labour relations where labour was personally bound to, and looked
###### after by, an employer, to capitalistic labour relations where labour,
skilled and unskilled, was sold on an impersonal labour market charac¬
terized by no personal obligations on either side for the welfare of the
other. This represented a profound transformation in the labour
process which required a major alteration in the nature of both the
labour force and the employers. This is the substance of the last two
chapters of this volume which Kealey has characterized as "the first
and perhaps still, the fullest account of Canada's industrial revolu¬
tion".41

The further transition from a capitalistic labour market to indus¬
trial capitalism required two major transformations: first, the emer¬
gence of a coherent and integrated domestic market that could
provide steady employment for a labouring class along with the intro¬
duction of machine processes that could serve such a market; and
second, the creation of a disciplined labour force that could and would
man the new processes. It required a remaking of the behaviour and
###### attitudes of the workers themselves, a remaking that constituted a
cultural as well as an economic transformation — a replacement of the
habits of irregularity, ill-discipline and sloth and a preoccupation with

longer-term view, all of which were necessary to the working of an
emerging capitalist order with its new scientific technology. The
description in Chapter 6 of this book chronicles only the first phase of
this transition of the labour process from pre-industrial man to the
industrial worker, the phase that I have designated elsewhere as the
artisanal period and which Leo Johnson designates as the period of the
manufactory based on craft control of production rather than on the
factory and machine control of production.42 As Pentland notes:

At the critical moment when industrial development was just
getting underway, the artisan was the key man who held the new
technology in his hands and brain and it was nowhere else....
Labour in the past had been regarded as a species of draft animal,
and in the future would be regarded as a type of machinery; but,
in the middle of the nineteenth century, skilled labour was an
important part of the community.43

Unskilled labour, however, was another matter, particularly in the
overstocked mid-century labour market. Yet this labour did learn
discipline, often as the result of troop or police repression, and by
learning to act together, developed a minimal measure of control over
the degree of their exploitation.

Such a transformation of labour was not easy, not accomplished
###### without intense worker opposition which, in turn, modified the very
system that was making it. This view appears in the section on the
Lachine strike, but it is more explicitly developed in the discussion of
ethnic bodies and particularly of the Orange Order as the defensive
organization of the artisan in this period of upheaval, although it
should be noted that Pentland's identification of the Order with the
artisan has since been questioned.44

What differentiates Pentland's approach from many of his contem¬
poraries was his explicit use of class in the analysis of labour's trans¬
formation.

The problem of production in all other [than primitive] societies
is complicated by the division of these societies into a ruling class,
which organizes the labour force (the rest of society) in its own
interest, and the ruled or working group, whose satisfactions are
a matter of expediency and of consistency with the demands of the
rulers. The methods of replenishing and training the labour force,
the choice of techniques and the organization of production, the
system of incentives used, are now matters determined by the
ruling group for those to whom they apply — the ruled group —
as the interest of the rulers dictates. While the social shorthand
of ritual retains a prominent role in such societies, change is facili-


-----

tated by the fact that, from the viewpoint of the rulers, the condi¬
tions of production are impersonal forces. Only from this vantage-
point is the logic of such systems of production apparent. On the
###### other hand, the ruled inevitably have a viewpoint also, different
from, and more or less hostile to, that of the rulers, which also has
to be taken into account.45

But Pentland was also well aware of the divisions within the domi¬
###### nant ruling class (between commercial and industrial capital), and
within the working class (between the skilled and unskilled), a conse¬
quence of the choice of techniques and the organization of production.
The result was that the demarcation between classes in terms of
objective economic function was blurred in terms of consciousness
such that industrial capital and its employees coalesced around the
issue of protection. This was manifested in the political support given
to the Conservative Party by the Orange Order.46 Once protection
was achieved by the coming together of the interests of commercial
and industrial capital, class conflict emerged as a more dominant
###### feature of society.47

Pentland's thesis carries the analysis of the transformation of the
Canadian economy and its people through to the 1870s when large-
scale industrial capitalism was still in its infancy. The factory system
was just beginning to revolutionize once more the labour process that
evolved by mid-century and this system was to destroy much of the
basis for the artisan-labourer social and economic division that had
been characteristic of the previous few decades. Nevertheless, the
seeds of change were sown. The "personal" market had become a self¬
regulating market. Labour had become a commodity traded on a cash
nexus.

The following period has since become fertile ground for a number
of scholars, and recently published work is too extensive to review in
detail here. Much of it has already been surveyed in a recent and
generally comprehensive review article.48 Nevertheless, it is perhaps
###### worth singling out a few recent contributions from authors who ack¬
nowledge their debt to Pentland's pioneering work, and who extend
the study to the period when industrial capitalism began to revolu¬
tionize production relations, destroying much of the basis for artisanal
control of production with the introduction of machine control within
the factory system, thereby deskilling the artisan class while opening
up new semi-skilled — or perhaps more accurately, work-skilled —
opportunities for the labourer.

Pentland discusses briefly some of the mechanisms by which this
new labour force was to be made to fulfil the needs of a new industri¬
alism: public education49 and the Mechanics'Institutes, "an index of the


-----

diffusion of belief in progress, and of industrial ambition",50 a diffu¬
sion more indicative of business aspirations than of working-class
self-improvement.51 He implies that industrial capitalism was already
emerging by the 1850s, although it is questionable whether it is
appropriate to think of mid-nineteenth-century Canada as industrial
in any significant sense. Katz calls Hamilton, one of the centres of
manufacturing output, a commercial city in the 1850s.52 Langdon, in
an ambitious attempt at synthesis, dates the origins from the 1860s,
although there were, of course, isolated examples of mechanization
###### threatening artisanal control of production in the 1840s and 1850s.53
But as he notes, by 1867 there were no known local unions whose
membership had reached 100 members, itself an indication of the rela¬
tively small scale of industrialism by Confederation.54

The most comprehensive and detailed studies of the evolution of
large-scale industrial capitalism and a modern industrial labour force
are the studies by Greg Kealey on Toronto and by Bryan Palmer on
Hamilton, and their joint work on the history of the Knights of
Labor.55 To Palmer and Kealey, the 1860s mark the transitional de¬
cade from the period of primitive accumulation, merchant capital and
capitalist handicraft production to that of modern industry, a transi¬
tion accelerated by the American Civil War.56 There was, however, no
sharp discontinuity between the periods. As Palmer notes, "the later
sixties would be something of an Indian Summer for the craft-based
manufactory."57 Although Toronto was highly industrialized by
1871, "numerous artisanal pursuits remained, in which production
was still centred in small shops with very few employees and a mini¬
mal level of mechanization."58 Still, the 1870s and 1880s saw the con¬
solidation of industrial capitalism and with it the evolution of new
types of working-class response, particularly in the form of the
Knights of Labor.

Paralleling, even anticipating, the emergence of industrial capital
was the increase in protectionist sentiment. Pentland was one of the
first to recognize the common manufacturer-worker interest in pro¬
tection and the resulting producer ideology championed by Isaac
Buchanan,59 at least until the 1880s when merchant and industrial
capital coalesced around the National Policy.60 But as Craven and
Traves have recently demonstrated, Pentland's view (and similarly
Palmer's and Kealey's) must be regarded as incomplete, largely igno¬
ring the importance of the third major class "in, but not of, industrial
Canada", the agrarian petite bourgeoisie.61 The existence of three classes,
they argue, led to an unstable series of alliances among the triad of
classes from the 1870s to the depression of the 1930s.62

While Pentland's thesis ends with the opening of this second trans¬
formation of the labour process which destroyed the central position


-----

of the skilled worker just as the earlier transformation had created it,
his study of the labour process and the industrial relations system did
not. It is continued in the Task Force report. The central question of
the report is the same as the thesis63 despite differences in time frame
and emphasis. Again, a central concern is the dynamic interaction
between the economy, employers, workers and their institutions, the
###### state, the organization of work and technological change. And again
he used class as an analytic tool.

Canadian experience has continually demonstrated another
###### phenomenon observable elsewhere: that tensions in industrial
relations increase or decrease as the "veal" gap between employ¬
ers and employed in capacity (as distinct from the constant gap
assumed by the institutional structure) has narrowed or widened.
Whenever workers have generally been advancing more rapidly
###### than employers in sophistication, tensions have been more acute.
When the real gap has widened, tensions have usually dimini-
ished.64

His conclusion about the major adaptation of the Canadian eco¬
nomy in the early decades of this century, a "profound re-orientation
and transformation of Canadian industry which adjusted it to the
market demands and technology of the twentieth-century as this
applied most obviously to Canadian resources", and its effect in trans¬
forming a second time the labour force and its institutions,65 parallels
his analysis and conclusions about the mid-nineteenth-century trans¬
formation. The report also suggests that the post-World War II period
was also one of those periods of intense change, in response to a new
and evolving technology.66

It is our great misfortune that Pentland never had the opportunity
to complete what I think was his ultimate goal, the complete history of
Canadian labour (organized and unorganized) and to bring the original
insights of his research together. Be that as it may, what he did com¬
plete is rich ground for students of working-class history.

###### Pentland and the National Question

Clare Pentland was a strong Canadian nationalist, sufficiently strong
to reject French-Canadian aspirations which he considered a threat to
Canadian nationhood. "Both history and logic (including Marxist
logic) weigh against Canada's chance of survival as two (or ten) nations,
against requiring exactly two cultures and 'founding races', and against
insisting that 25 per cent of us must have a one-to-one relationship
with the other 75 per cent, and so on."67 His rejection of any notion of
a bi-national state is also founded in his interpretation of the class basis


-----

his interpretation of the economic nature of the original Canadian
Confederation.68 His conception of the birth of the Canadian nation,
while not denying the importance of the Innis-Creighton imperialist
conception (of the nation-building commercial class based on the staple
trades), is based more on an analysis of the industrial roots. As such,
his work bears directly on the debate on the "national question" en¬
gendered by the publication of Capitalism and the National Question in 1972,
and more particularly the article by Tom Naylor contained in that collec¬
tion, "The Rise and Fall of the Third Commercial Empire of the St.
Lawrence", subsequently expanded on in his two-volume History of
Canadian Business 1867-1914.69 Naylor, following the conception of
Creighton's Commercial Empire of the St. Lawrence, argued that Confedera¬
tion and the policies which have come to be known collectively as the
"national policy" were a continuation of the commercial dominance of
the St. Lawrence to the exclusion of industrial capitalism.

Canadian development policy in the National Policy era was
essentially a policy of mercantilism, of consolidation and expan¬
sion led by a commercial capitalist class in which the state struc¬
###### ture in the hands of that class played a critically active role.70

Pentland fundamentally disagreed. He would not even accept that
no significant industrial working class had emerged prior to Confedera¬
tion,71 although he would not go as far as some of Naylor's critics,
such as MacDonald, who treat the railways, designed to promote
commercial activity, as industrial capital.72 In fact, Pentland, along
with Ryerson and Fowke, have from their differing perspectives,
argued that Canadian Confederation and the national policy repre¬
sent a conjuncture of capitalist interests, be they industrial, commercial,
financial or transportation, French or English.73 It was a capitalist
imperialism of central Canada in relation to the resources and the
markets of the west. Indeed, for Pentland, it was this conjuncture of
commercial and industrial interests, once protection was achieved,
###### that spelled the beginning of the end of the producer coalition of
worker and employer and permitted the realignment of interests upon
class lines.

Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to consider that this position is,
somehow, a repudiation of the importance of commercial capital in the
same period. Pentland was well aware of the impact of the needs of
staple exploitation on the creation of conditions for the emergence of
an industrially disciplined labour force, for it was in the creation of
commercial infrastructure (transportation systems) that the labour
force was forged. As he notes, "so long as economic life in Canada
consisted of the looting of surface resources (furs, seals, timber),
capital requirements were limited to the provision of short-term


-----

mercantile capital, circulating capital. [But] the canals and railway
systems, designed to intensify staple production and intercontinental
division of labour, had precisely opposite effects in the end."71
Precisely! It was pursuance of commercial gains in the staple trades
###### that required improved transportation systems which, in turn, crea¬
ted the demand for a capitalistic labour market and to which an elastic
supply of labour was attracted. The filling in of the labour market with
increased population and wage earners, and the product market with
wage income, in turn created the demand conditions for the growth of
industrial development. There were, of course, elements of a funda¬
mental conflict of interest between merchants and manufacturers
over tariffs and taxation to support transportation improvement. But,
initially at least, this was an era of local industrial production — hand
###### manufacture under artisanal control — in which transportation costs
provided effective protection from competition from other centres
###### where the same small-scale manufacture took place.

Railways, improved transportation and communications, and the
###### growth of large-scale, mechanized factories in the United States
began to erode and eventually destroy this protection, thereby crea¬
ting in Canadian labour (both skilled and unskilled) and among rising
capitalists a mutual interest in increased tariff protection. Some
###### merchants — those in the export-import business and the maritime entrepot traders — no doubt had a vested interest in opposing tariffs. Others, like the wholesalers serving agricultural markets, obviously
acquired protectionist leanings, and increasingly integrated backward
into manufacturing to supply their markets. (This whole process is
described below in Chapter 5.) But it was the national question that
ultimately resolved the conflict of interest as Pentland clearly recog¬
nizes.

Soon after [Confederation], the prospect of exploiting the West
now appeared .... The National Policy of 1879 was one weapon of
Canadian imperialism. Its purpose was not to make Western
Canada, also, a participant in a self-contained economy; for the
West was fully expected to sell its staple product in world mar¬
kets, as it did, and there appears to have been no regret that the
new Canadian structure was thus made more vulnerable and
###### dependent than its predecessor. The task of the National Policy of
1879 was rather to ensure that unprotected Western wheat was
carried by protected Canadian railroads, handled by protected
Canadian traders, and that the supplies of the West should come
from protected manufacturers, in order that as much as possible
of the gains to be made would be drawn to old Canada, and not to


-----

brought merchants and railroads suddenly around in the 1870s,
so that Eastern Canada spoke with an undivided protectionist
voice.75

Thus Pentland cannot be said to be in unequivocal support of any
###### interpretation that would give primacy to either mercantile capital or
industrial capital in national strategy, including protection. Those
who would relegate Pentland to the industrial capital side of the battle
against the troops supporting mercantile capital, simply ignore what
he has written. In fact, as he was to point out, the adoption of the
national policy — whatever its industrial intentions — had the effect
of increasing the staple dependence (and hence the commercial-
financial strength) of the Canadian economy. "Now protection receiv¬
ed for the first time the name of "National Policy", and ceased for the
first time to be a national policy".76 In Unequal Union, published seven
years after Pentland's thesis, Ryerson appears to adopt a similar
approach to the constitutional form of the national policy. Confeder¬
ation.77 In places Ryerson refers to "the men who shaped Confedera¬
tion, the political spokesmen of the banking, trading and railway
###### interests — the rising Canadian capitalist class..."78 But elsewhere
he says the pressure for Confederation was one of "industrial capitalist
development... to unify and expand the home market."79 However, in
###### other places he tends to imply a contradiction between the interests
and power of commercial and industrial capital.80

Thus, although Pentland and Ryerson are often linked as propo¬
###### nents of an industrial capitalist interpretation of the national policy,
as opposed to the commercial capitalist view implied by the staple
###### interpretation (best exemplified by Creighton and Naylor), it would
perhaps be more correct to place Pentland on more middle ground. His
position stressed rather the coalition of mercantile and industrial
###### interests in the national policy, a position he shared with his fellow western economic historian, Vernon Fowke, albeit from a different
regional perspective.81

This qualification is important to an understanding of Pentland's
particular nationalism and his opposition to regionalism and Quebec's
particularism. He attempted to integrate the conflicting interpreta¬
tions of class divisions accentuated by the rise of industrial capitalism,
and of regional divisions responding to the commercial exploitation
of resource regions. One result of this is the tendency to criticize
Pentland for accepting a form of western exceptionalism.82 Rather,
his view is tied to the differing class response in different regions to
the tariff, and to the nature of capitalist development in the western
and central Canadian regions.83

###### Labour and Capital in Canada, 1650-1860 —Twenty Years After

The two decades since the thesis was presented have produced a re¬
markable crop of labour and working-class studies in Canada, both
###### within the traditional North American vein of institutional and poli¬
tical labour history and, more recently, in "the rescuing of Canadian
###### workers from the margins of history", the social history of the
uncommon, common man .84 The obvious question is the extent to
which Pentland s observations and conclusions must be amended to
incorporate the findings of more recent research. Although Pentland
was one of the pioneers in the use of pre-Confederation documents in
the Public Archives of Canada (many of which were not even cata¬
logued at that time), he was nevertheless forced by gaps in the
primary and secondary sources available to him to make some fairly
speculative leaps in analysis and interpretation. Some of the recent
scholarship relates directly to these gaps and should be incorporated
into Pentland s analysis as no doubt he would have done, had he been
able. At the same time, I would suggest that there is not a great deal in
this recent work that contradicts the general thrust and argument
while supplementing and, in places, correcting the detail.

Pentland s concern with slavery and "feudal" labour relations in
Canada has been unique. What is perhaps more significant is that his
economic analysis of pre-capitalist labour relations in Canada is
supported and complemented by a more general theoretical analysis by
the American economist, Evsey Domar, published a decade later.85
Pentland's argument is based upon the supposition that labour scar¬
city relative to land encourages the establishment of a system of
###### "unfree" labour — slave, serf, indentured servant or convict. As long
as land is free (or at least cheap enough to be within the reach of the
lower orders), labour will choose to cultivate its own holdings rather
###### than generate a rental surplus to be appropriated by the large land¬
holders or other employers in order to maintain themselves as a
governing elite.

Domar uses the following formulation to develop the point. There
will be economic benefit to a ruling elite to adopt and enforce unfree
labour institutions where the lower productivity of unfree labour is
more than offset by the lower wage costs of unfree labour; that is
where:

Pf — Ps<Wf —Ws
###### where Pf = Productivity of free labour

Ps = Productivity of unfree labour

Wf = Labour cost of free labour

Ws = Labour cost of unfree labour


-----

What determines the productivity and the wages or labour costs of free
and unfree labour? Pentland's major contribution was to relate this
question to the labour supply and demand conditions operative in
Canada in the period before the development of large-scale industrial
capitalism in the latter half of the nineteenth century.

Part of the thesis investigates the period when labour, while
absolutely necessary to even minimal production — such as in iron
production at the St. Maurice Forges — was not in sufficient year-
###### round demand to maintain an unbound labour force. This study of the
St. Maurice Forges remains the most insightful analysis to date of this
early experiment in industrial development in a non-industrial envi¬
ronment.

Pentland made only brief reference to the role of the native popula¬
tion in the supply of labour to the European-oriented economy.86 In part
this reflects the fact that his main concern was the period of transition
from a pre-capitalist to capitalist economy in central Canada. But it
also reflects the fact that the investigation of the economics of the
aboriginal participation in the European-based economy has only re¬
cently come under renewed academic scrutiny with results that remain
in dispute. Was the Indian an "economic man" in the fur trade or was he
a "political-military" man using the European fur traders as a strategic
ally in the continuing battle for space in the northern reaches of the
continent?

The recent literature is by no means unanimous. Some attempts have
been made to argue that the aboriginal participation in the fur trade
was basically non-economic in motivation. Eccles even suggests that the
whole trade was non-economic in motivation, that from a European
point of view it was an adjunct to military supremacy in the new
world.87 However, the most thorough exposition of the non-economic
characteristics of native participation in the fur trade is given by
Rotstein in his 1972 article.

European traders were oriented towards profits which depended
on fluctuating prices for their staples in Europe and tended to
regard economic transactions as arms-length and impersonal
activities. None of this was true for the Indian tribes which they
encountered. Trade was a highly personal activity, an encounter of
two political groups or their representatives (not of individuals) and
followed established political patterns.88

Much of his argument is based on the reciprocal gift-giving that pre¬
ceded any exchange and the accompanying ceremonial festivities and
dances which likewise accompanied political missions and encounters.

Such a characterization of the nature of the fur trade relationship
seems inconsistent with Pentland's characterization of the relationship


-----

3S 3kin to the "merchant-employer system of commercial capitalism" in
which the distribution of bargaining power was such that the Indians
were forced to trade on "extremely disadvantages terms".89

On the other hand, work by Ray, and Ray and Freeman is much more
supportive of Pentland's characterization.™ The Indians appeared to
behave sometimes in a non-economic fashion by reducing the number
of furs traded when competition bid up the price (in terms of trade
goods) or demanding a fixed price regardless of the state of the
European market. This was eminently sensible economic behaviour to a
migratory labour force which could not transport or accumulate surplus
stores, but which had become dependent on European trade goods for
their sustenance and their productivity.91 Bargaining power thus was a
function of the degree of competition among the buyers. In the pursuit
of monopoly, therefore, the English and French or the Hudson's Bay
Company and the North West Company were pursuing the goal of
European commercial capitalism as would a later generation of
Canadian commercial capitalists in their dealings with Canadian inde¬
pendent commodity producers, in particular with the staple farmers.

More difficult to assess is the apparent non-economic behaviour of
the Indian in driving into virtual extinction many of the animals that
were the mainstays of the fur trade. McManus has argued that this
behaviour follows from the common property resources characteristic
of fur-bearing animals.92 But it is perhaps more general to argue that
the natives' dependence on European trade goods — particularly if those
goods had allowed the indigenous population to increase — forced them
to deplete animal stocks merely to survive in the face of falling real
prices for furs and pressure on the land resources by alternate economic
uses. Such behaviour would be compatible with observed behaviour by
other independent commodity producers.

On the other hand, it should at least be noted that recently the pro¬
position has been advanced that the over-harvesting of fur-bearing
animals was not economically motivated at all but occurred because the
Indians associated animals with the spread of European diseases.93 That
proposition seems rather far-fetched.

In the original thesis, Pentland used the term "feudal" to describe the
labour relations pertaining to the European labour force involved in the
fur trade, the industries of New France and the timber industry. In the
later revisions, this was altered to "personal" labour relations. The
change is significant, a recognition that the concept of feudalism is too
narrowly restrictive to a European-based political system of parcellized
sovereignty, the applicability of which has been questioned even in
the context of the seigneurial system of New France.94 His central
argument is economic, not political. Because of the insecurities of labour


-----

ployer and employee had to be established. But it was not a bond of
market exchange. Rather, it was a bond of reciprocal if unequal obliga¬
tion. That characterized by European feudalism, which may or may not
have found comparable expression in the seigneurial system of New
France, was only one political-economic form. The more generalized
form, he designated personal labour relations, relations that were charac¬
terized by the employers' obligation to provide the "fixed costs of
sustenance and reproduction, in exchange for a loyal and reasonably
efficient labour force, a form he explores in examples from the fur trade
to the St. Maurice Forges.

Some contemporary readers may feel some unease at Pentland's dis¬
cussion of paternalism in labour relations because of the apparent
stereotyping of the French and Indian populations as "childlike in
their relations with employers.95 Certainly one must reject the more
excessive popular depictions of the aboriginal population as no more
###### than backward children, despite the language (at least the English
versions) of the Indian treaties and the language and customs of the fur
trade ceremonies where the Indians were referred to as "children" and
behaved in what might appear to be a childish manner.96 But as Ray and
Freeman conclude, "the pre-trade ceremonies were probably more akin
to the exchanges of courtesies.or pleasantries which often precede
business dealings in the modern Western world"97 (including the proli¬
fic use of alcohol) and certainly no more childish than the goings-on at a
modern Shriners' convention.98 On the other hand, the docility of the
French-Canadian worker has been remarked upon by other modern
scholars.99

Nevertheless it is important to understand what Pentland is attemp¬
ting to convey: that in an economy where the habitants and the Indians
were dependent on employers, seigneurs or the trading companies for
###### year-round sustenance and capital (the trade goods were in part capital
goods to the fur trade), the relationship of the employer or trader needs
to be paternalistic — implying a responsibility for the welfare of the
habitant or native, a responsibility akin to that of a parent for a child.100
It is true that the employer or trader was also dependent on the worker
or Indian. But, as Adam Smith has pointed out in relation to the indus¬
trial worker and the industrial employer, the worker's needs are much
more immediate and desperate.101 In most cases, in pre-capitalist
Canada, there was little or no alternative choice of employer.

In his discussion of pre-Confederation agriculture in Fower Canada,
Pentland did not have the benefit of the research of the recent genera¬
tion of French-Canadian historians, in particular the work of Ouellet
and Hamelin, and Paquet and Wallot.102 Ouellet and Hamelin generally
support the argument taken by Pentland that French-Canadian agricul¬
ture at least on the old seigneuries did enter a period of crisis and re-


-----

trenchment in the early years of the nineteenth century, a crisis of
stagnation that was a factor in the Rebellion of 1837 and was at least in
part caused by the habitants' inability and/or unwillingness to adopt
more productive agricultural techniques. Paquet and Wallot challenge
this view, arguing that the problems faced by Lower Canada were
structural, arising from the inability of the agricultural economy to
adjust quickly enough to changes in demand and prices in the period of
instability that accompanied the Napoleonic Wars and the post-war
readjustments. This interpretation does directly challenge Pentland's
account. On the other hand, LeGoff's recent attempt to sum up the
debate leans toward the Ouellet position, indirectly supporting Pent-
land, although he places his emphasis on population increase as the
prime cause of agricultural stagnation.103 At best, therefore, we must
conclude that the jury is still out on the debate. But, whatever the
outcome regarding the early years of the century, Pentland's more
fundamental point regarding the inability of the Lower Canadian econ¬
omy in the nineteenth century to absorb the natural increase and the
consequent flood of emigration remains valid and is supported by Isbis-
ter in his recent article on the latter part of the century.104

Still, it is possible to question Pentland's conclusion that the French
Canadian was only "a potential or marginal member, rather than an
actual member, of the labour force."105 The nature of labour market
demand was hardly conducive to the encouragement of full-time parti¬
cipation by an unskilled, rural people. As Pentland has pointed out else¬
where, the artisanal and skilled jobs required a commitment to perma¬
nent occupation of the labour market as well as the requisite skills, a
commitment that British industrial workers had only acquired from
years of experience in Britain.106 At the same time, factory employment
comparable to the textile industry of New England was in its infancy
and when it did develop, it did so with French-Canadian labour. The
French Canadian did participate in the shipbuilding and timber indus¬
try, in the latter particularly as raftsmen.107 It would appear that
French-Canadian participation in the labour market was more akin to
what Sacouman has called the semi-proletarianism of the domestic
mode of primary production where subsistence farming provides for
the fixed cost of maintaining and reproducing labour for seasonal,
irregular, low-wage industries.108 It was precisely the lack of steady
demand for labour that would appear to have been the reason for lack of
French participation in the labour force, a situation that Pentland
contrasts with the immigrant Irish. But, again, the evidence is hardly
that compelling. As he notes himself, the French Canadian was perio¬
dically in competition for jobs with the Irish109 and, although competi¬
tion for the heavy labouring jobs in public works was hardly keen, "Irish


-----

wages and conditions on these jobs, the smaller physical stature of
the French compared with the Irish, and the migratory nature of em¬
ployment, it is hardly a wonder that the habitant stuck to his farm
if he could. However depressed it might be, the alternative was
hardly attractive. Besides, the French Canadian, at least in the earlier
years of the nineteenth century, had not been oppressed and re¬
duced to such economic destitution that he had come to consider
agriculture an undesirable pursuit as Pentland argues the Catholic Irish
had.111

One of the most original aspects of Labour and Capital in Canada, 1650-
1860 is its central concern with the role of the Irish immigrant in the
making of the Canadian labour market, perhaps in part a reflection of
Pentland's own Ulster heritage. Again, this is an area where more
recent work has tended both to confirm his general argument and to
raise some specific objections, particularly with his treatment of the
Orange Order. Some readers may interpret the characterization of the
Irish as "primitive", "intemperate", "improvident" and "gregarious" as
ethnic stereotyping which should be amended in the light of more con¬
temporary research. Yet much subsequent scholarship serves to rein¬
force Pentland's characterization rather than contest it. Duncan, for
example, notes "violence and riots, disease, crime, drunkeness, and
prostitution were rife" in the Irish Catholic working-class slums and
goes on to show how the pattern of behaviour in Canada had its roots in
Irish society.112 Similar support for Pentland's view is given in the work
of Michael Cross, particularly in his study of the "Shiners' War"113 while
the general fractiousness of the contending Irish religious groups is re¬
corded by Palmer and Kealey.114 The general conclusions of this later
work extends Pentland's analysis but does not contradict it.

On the other hand, Kealey does challenge Pentland's interpretation
of the specific role of the Orange Order as an institution that "repre¬
sented the artisan"115 while the unskilled labourers "used their ethnic
community to organize their strikes and promote their political inter¬
ests."116 Kealey, by contrast, argues that the Orange Order in Toronto
was "overwhelmingly working-class", but not limited to artisans. "No
imaginative flights can transform Toronto Orangemen into a labour
aristocracy."117 His data on Toronto makes a persuasive argument that
the Orange Order was, in fact, a fairly broad based, Protestant organi¬
zation with strong working-class roots. The question that arises,
however, is how general this working-class composition was. Cross's
work, for instance, tends to emphasize the middle-class (Tory) agricul¬
tural basis of Orange activity around Ottawa which coincided with
religious divisions.118 It is probable that no single characterization of the
Order is possible in all areas, at all times. Without doubt, the Orange
Order did play a part in working-class organization but its complex


-----

###### interrelationship with political and religious divisions suggests that no
single characterization is possible. The answer to the question of the
ro e of the Order, and indeed of the “green" organizations among
Catholics, still awaits a comprehensive treatment, but it is probably safe
to conclude that Pentland's original view is too simplistic.

Somewhat surprisingly, Pentland's treatment of the 1837 rebellions
is somewhat fragmentary and cursory.™ This is surprising if only
because of the degree of attention since given them by other labour and
social historians who were also interested in the development of
###### the nineteenth-century Canadian political economy.120 Ryerson's treat¬ ment, the most extensive, interprets the failure of both rebellions,
which he defines as "bourgeois-democratic, class and national revolu-
tion(s)," as a reflection of the immature development of industrial
capitalism and with it an undeveloped anti-mercantile bourgeoisie and a
working class as yet unconscious of its existence as a separate class.121
Lipton interprets the rebellions in even more class-specific terms, part
of the “world fight for labour and democracy" and credits the defeats to
the preference of business and capital for “collaboration with, and
###### subordination to, foreign capitalists... to alliance with workers and farmers in Canada, the 'mechanics' and 'yeomen'."122 But Lipton's
analysis seems somewhat superficial and simplistic.

It is Johnson who gives the most intensive and complex analysis,
###### though limited to a relatively small area of Upper Canada, the County of Ontario. He sees the conflict as between the "Tory" vision of a stratified
society ordered around a privileged social and economic elite,122 and the
###### reform vision, a democratic society ordered around the "sturdy yeo¬
man, the independent producers — farmer, craftsman or [small] mer¬
###### chant."124 The reform vision looked with increasing horror at the social
implications of the industrial revolution and the creation of a degraded
working class which was foreseen in the expansion of large-scale capi¬
talism to Upper Canada. Though the rebellion was defeated by the
British-backed establishment, Britain soon granted responsible govern¬
###### ment which swept away the Tory vision. But the reform vision would
likewise perish, “prey to the new, rising class of entrepreneurs whose
version of 'progress' was the accumulation of capital and the employ¬
###### ment of men."125

These three interpretations, although based on the same type of
historical approach to the development of labour and industrial capita¬
lism, nevertheless are at variance to a greater or lesser extent with each
###### other and with Pentland's treatment which is insufficiently developed
to compare or contrast to the others in any detail. Yet what he does say
suggests an interpretation blending some elements of both Ryerson and
Johnson but different from both — a rebellion by an increasingly eco¬


-----

economic dependence on a transatlantic staple trade controlled by, and
for the benefit of, the merchant class.126 It would be wrong, however, to
###### attempt to fit Pentland's interpretation to the procrustean bed of view¬
ing the rebellions as an abortive "bourgeois revolution" or his artisans as
an immature industrial working class.

The Pentland Legacy

When Pentland defended his thesis in 1961 he opened up an area of
historical and economic studies which had previously been neglected by
Canadian economic historians. He was not alone in his interest in the
growth of manufacturing in Central Canada in the latter half of the
nineteenth century,127 but his concern with the broad historical aspects
of economic development and social change made his work virtually
unique. No one since has attempted a study of the industrial transfor¬
mation of Canada of a similar depth or breadth, though, as I have indi¬
cated above, there has been considerable work on specific topics or
regions included in the original thesis but not explored in detail. This
has been particularly true of the nineteenth-century Quebec128 and, to a
lesser extent, of the emergence of organized labour129 and the political
and social history of the labouring classes.130

We are probably approaching the time when someone will attempt
a new synthesis of this body of work, particularly now that the manu¬
script censuses are available for the critical transitional years. Never¬
theless, despite the firm foundation of Pentland's work (supplemented
by the variety of studies already referred to), the task is formidable,
possibly even premature. Critical debates are still unresolved and may
indeed remain unsolved in the largely pre-statistical era of the nine¬
###### teenth century. Modern economic theory is a poor beacon to guide
one in this period of systemic change, even for those who regard this
###### theory as a valuable guide to contemporary economic processes (and
clearly there are many in the field who do not). We have had more than a
decade now of economic and quantitative history research, and the
results, however, fruitful in enriching our knowledge of specific issues
in economic history, have not brought us much closer to understanding
broader issues of the type that Clare Pentland was trying to illumi¬
nate.131 Probably the very nature of the questions quantitative history
asks and the issues it is able to deal with preclude a real investigation of
the industrial revolution in Canada and the accompanying transforma¬
tion of the "uncommon, common man", the making of a modern
working class.

Pentland's study was the first attempt at a general treatment of this
social and economic transformation, though incomplete, as he was quite
consciously aware. To date it remains the only comprehensive treat¬
ment and until now has remained unpublished — a situation that Wat-


-----

kins has found 'incredible".132 But responsibility for this lies with Clare
Pentland, not with publishers or scholars ignoring his contribution. He
was aware of the gaps, of the unresolved questions and of the deficien¬
cies in evidence, which is why he was reluctant to submit it for publica¬
tion. This was what excited him about the new generation of scholars
probing the period, no matter that he disagreed at times with their
reading of the evidence. But if and when a new synthesis is put
together, the author of that work will owe a debt directly and indirectly
to Pentland, and to the Social Science Federation of Canada whose
financial support finally helped make readily available this seminal work
to future generations of students and scholars.

3 In the notes that follow pertaining to the Pentland thesis, the reader is
referred to the current volume.

4 Kealey has noted that "Pentland's use of 'feudal' is unique. What he means
by it is the 'labour organization that preceded the free market of industrial
capitalism, that was not slavery, nor a putting-out system, nor the share
system of early capitalist commerce' ("Labour and Industrial Capitalism",
p. 54). Thus it is a name he uses for a preindustrial hut capitalist form of
labour organization and should not be confused with classic European
feudalism" (G.S. Kealey, "H.C. Pentland and Working Class Studies", Cana¬
dian Journal of Political and Social Theory, Spring/Summer 1979, p. 92). Pentland
was obviously not entirely comfortable with his original terminology, and
in the revised manuscript "feudal labour" was changed to "personal labour
relations". But the term retains the essence of the feudal bond, personal
obligation, rather than the impersonality of the self-regulating capitalistic
labour market.

March 1943.

introduction to A History of Farmers' Movements in Canada (Toronto: University
of Toronto Press, 1975; originally published 1924), particularly pp. vi-viii.

16 Loc. cit. Wood used texts such as Gustavus Meyers', History of Canadian Wealth
and O.D. Skelton's Socialism: A Critical Analysis (p.viii). Among the materials
that Pentland collected during the war were a number of socialist and
Marxist pamphlets, largely British.

17 Ibid., p viii.

18 Pentland took the following courses at Toronto: economic history from
Innis, economic theory from G.A. Elliot, labour economics from H.A.
Logan, sociology from S.D. Clark, and industrial relations from F. Toombs.
See Kealey, "FT C. Pentland and Working Class Studies", p. 80.

19 See in particular Daniel Drache, "Rediscovering Canadian Political Eco¬
nomy", Journal of Canadian Studies, August 1976, pp. 3-18.

20 Innis, frequently in his writing, was intensely critical of the received
doctrines of economic theory without an historical and political dimension.
For an interesting discussion, heavily weighted to Innis's views, see Ian
Parker, "The National Policy, Neoclassical Economics, and the Political
Economy of Tariffs", Journal of Canadian Studies, Fall 1979.

21 Indeed, Pentland considered himself as much an historian as an economist
and was hostile to the concentration on economic theory courses in univer¬
sity economics programs. He was president of the Manitoba Historical
Society from 1963 to 1965, a founding member and third president of the
Manitoba Records Society and active in local history work.

22 It is interesting to note that, although it was some years after his thesis,
Pentland took a side trip from the Montreal Learned Societies to view the
remains of the St. Maurice Forges to which he had devoted considerable
attention in his thesis.

23 This is not true of some of the people writing within the dependency school
which may be considered to include the staple model as one of its varients.
For a critical view of the dependency school see H. Veltmeyer, "A Central
Issue in Dependency Theory", Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology,

death prevented his completing the task.

evolution of the labour market in class terms should be dispelled by this
review. "Thus, capitalism has proceeded, as Marx predicted, to grind small
independent owners out of existence, leaving ownership of the means of
production concentrated in the hands of a small capitalist class, the rest of
us dependent on sale of our labour, and Canadian society quite close to the
simple two-class confrontation that socialists have expected — a conclu¬
sion that should surprise nobody, but that probably does need a lot of poin¬
ting out" (p. 26).

72 L.R MacDonald, "Merchants Against Industry: An Idea and its Origins",
Canadian Historical Review, Sept. 1975, p. 264. MacDonald's contention that
railways were industrial rather than commercial pursuits seems to me to
be a red herring if not actually incorrect, however Marx characterized
them. The railroads were advanced and built to support a staple commerce,
not to support industrial production whatever their ultimate effect may
have been. MacDonald also argues that V.C. Fowke, Alfred Dubuc and
Stanley Ryerson as well as Pentland "have advanced the view that the
development of trade did not require, and was even antagonistic to, the
growth of production" (p. 264). This misrepresents both Pentland and
Fowke in the period from Confederation.

###### Preface

A fundamental problem of any society is the organization of its labour
force for production. If the society is to survive as an entity, ways must
be evolved or devised to maintain or increase the labour force, to deter¬
mine the nature and extent of the division of its labour (the techniques
to be used), and to establish and enforce the system of incentives. The
solutions of these problems fasten their appropriate behaviour patterns
upon the various members of each society. If a social system is to func¬
tion well, the patterns of social behaviour must be self-consistent; and it
follows that they are distinct from other sets of patterns that denote
different social systems. However, the arrangements for production
and the behaviour appropriate to them need not be entirely free of dis¬
harmonies and conflicts: the survival of production systems turns
rather on whether the conflicts are within the limits of tolerance of the
participants.

In primitive societies (and also, ideally, in socialist societies) the po¬
tential labour force consists of all the members of society, and the
methods of production are those that these members conceive to yield
the greatest mutual benefit. These societies, like others, must provide
for mobilization of the labour force, for training in the chosen tech¬
niques, for ensuring the appropriate division and cooperation of labour,
and for the distribution of the social product. For these purposes prim¬
itive societies appear to depend upon ritual and ceremony in a more
exclusive and absolute sense than is true of other societies.

The problem of production in all other societies is complicated by the
division of these societies into a ruling class, which organizes the labour
force (the rest of the society) in its own interest, and the ruled or work¬
ing group, whose satisfactions are a matter of expediency and of consis¬
tency with the demands of the rulers. The methods of replenishing and
training the labour force, the choice of techniques and the organization
of production, the system of incentives used, are now matters deter¬
mined by the ruling group for those to whom they apply — the ruled


-----

of ritual retains a prominent role in such societies, change is facilitated
by the fact that, from the viewpoint of the rulers, the conditions of
production are impersonal forces. Only from this vantage-point is the
logic of such systems of production apparent. On the other hand, the
ruled inevitably have a viewpoint also, different from, and more or less
hostile to, that of the rulers, which also has to be taken into account.
Divided societies can be categorized into slave societies, feudal societies
and capitalist societies, though there is obviously a good deal of variety
within these general types. A large part of the interest of historians, in
their studies, has been focused upon the manner in which one system of
economic and social organization has superseded another in the trans¬
formation of particular societies.

The present study is concerned with the way that European society in
Canada has evolved through the earlier portion of its existence up to the
flowering of full industrial capitalism. It is conceived that this develop¬
ment involved the widespread use of a social organization that had
much in common with feudal organization but which, to avoid confu¬
sion with the specific European political institution, will be designated in
this study as the system of "personal labour relations"; that this type of
organization was succeeded in one area after another by arrangements
inspired by capitalist organization; and that these transitional forms in
turn yielded to a true industrial capitalism. The particular thesis of the
study is that the evolution of Canadian society depended heavily upon
the state of the labour market: the quantity and types of labour available
to employers. It will be of concern, therefore, to show why and how
changes have occurred in the availability of labour; why and how the
organizers of production in Canada adjusted themselves to new condi¬
tions in their labour market and in other respects; and why and how the
workers themselves modified their patterns of behaviour.

European exploitation of Canada was begun, and the greater part of it
proceeded, in the period when "commercial capitalism" was the domi¬
nant type of arrangement in Western Europe. Canadian development
had necessarily to accommodate itself to that fact, and the typical sys¬
tem of the production of staple goods for export to metropolitan mar¬
kets, which has characterized economic life in Canada and elsewhere,
was the logical outcome. Commercial capitalism has been, however, a
system that asked remarkably few questions about the method of
production of the goods in which it dealt. It could readily integrate slave
societies, feudal societies and incipient capitalist societies into its struc¬
ture. It is not apparent that the European settlers of Canada were pro¬
hibited in any absolute sense from arranging production upon a basis
of slavery, or upon a basis of small-scale capitalism: European settlers
elsewhere had chosen such courses. But, in fact, it was a personal form


-----

nineteenth century. The basis of the choice of method in Canada's case
(and in the other cases) lay in the nature of the supply of, and demand
tor labour. In Canada, there was a relative scarcity of labour, particu¬
larly of specific kinds of skilled labour, which ruled out dependence upon
a capitalistic labour market. On the other hand, the nature of employ¬
ment was so little adapted to slavery that that solution was never seri¬
ously attempted. In the nineteenth century a new condition, relative
abundance of labour (unskilled and skilled), invited the replacement of
personal arrangements by new ones that approximated more and more
to the industrial capitalist methods developed elsewhere.

The tasks of this study are to delineate the personal organization of
labour as it appeared in various Canadian employments up till about
1850, and to trace the transformation that produced a capitalistic labour
market and a well-developed capitalistic economy, shortly after 1850.
Before undertaking these studies, however, it is convenient to dispose
of "Slavery in Canada".

###### CHAPTER I

 Slavery in Canada

 The Incidence of Slavery

Slavery was practised in Canada for nearly two centuries. The most
striking thing about it, nevertheless, is how shallow-rooted and how
limited in use enslavement was.

Slaves in Canada, in the classical meaning of perpetual bond-ser¬
vants, were either negroes, brought from the West Indies and the
American colonies, or "Panis" Indians. Possibly the first was a negro
boy sold at Quebec in 1629.1 By 1688 there had arisen a general de¬
mand at Quebec for the importation of negroes as a means of supplying
###### the labour market.2 In 1689, the colonial government received author¬
ity from France to permit the importation of negroes, and some slaves
were probably brought in by 1692.3 In 1721, again, as part of a pro¬
gram to promote hemp-growing in Canada, Intendant Begon sought
the importation of negroes. The authorities in France approved and
took some steps to provide the negroes, but it is not clear whether any
actually arrived on this occasion.4 Private persons, of course, brought
in negro slaves sometimes, but the number was never large. In
Quebec, it appears, there were only six negro slaves in 1716 and
twenty-five in 1744.5 Negro slaves, and the considerably larger body
of Indian slaves, were used almost exclusively as domestic servants
###### throughout Canada's history. Ownership was confined, therefore, to
the few who could afford such a luxury.

The enslavement of Indians, much more common in New France
###### than the enslavement of negroes, had appeared at Montreal by 1670.6
"Panis", the name applied to these slaves, derived from the Pawnees, a
###### distant and docile tribe, whose members were easily captured by the
Foxes and brought by them for sale to the French.7 However, mem¬
bers of a number of other tribes appeared among the Panis.8 "There
were a considerable number of panis in the colony, especially, natural¬
ly, in Montreal. A tenth of the names in the register of burials in


-----

remarkable in that it was evidently the custom to release Panis after a
few years of servitude, in the expectation that otherwise they would
escape to the forest anyhow.10

The legality of negro slavery in New France, if there ever was any
question about it, was settled apparently by the royal permission of
1689. The legality of Indian slavery, which was questioned at least
once, was established by an ordinance of 1709.11 The existence of
freed Panis, and the additional consideration that Indians were some¬
times employed as wage labour,12 must have invited confusion con¬
cerning the status of Indians in New France. Some clarification may
have been afforded by the requirement, from 1736, of a declaration be¬
fore a notary when freeing Panis.13 By the terms of the capitulation of
Montreal in 1760, the inhabitants were confirmed in the possession of
their slaves.14

Under British rule, there was a decline of Indian enslavement in
Canada, but a sharp increase in the number of negro slaves. Many of
the merchants and officials who came to Quebec and Montreal
brought negroes with them for use as domestic servants.15 Newcom¬
ers at Kingston, Niagara and Detroit (as in Nova Scotia) likewise often
brought negroes with them. It has been asserted, also, that in the
1780s drovers brought slaves to Canada for sale, along with horses,
cattle and sheep.16 Indian tribes, too, did a certain amount of business
in stolen or captured slaves.17 A census of 1784 reported 304 (negro?)
slaves in Lower Canada.18

The legal basis for slavery in the British period is not very clear. The
confirmation of Montrealers in their possessions at least set a pattern,
and an imperial act of 1790 authorized the issue of licences to new set¬
tlers in British North America to bring slaves with them.19 Main de¬
pendence seems to have been placed, however, on the argument that
Intendant Raudot's ordinance of 1709 was one of the laws and usages
recognized by the Quebec Act.20 In any case, there appears to have
been no opposition to the institution until after 1790.

Slavery in Canada was disposed of quickly, nevertheless. The Upper
Canadian Legislature in 1793 confirmed existing owners in posses¬
sion of their slaves, but prohibited importation; provided that children
born to slaves after 1793 should be freed at the age of twenty-five; and
provided further that any children born to these offspring in turn in a
state of slavery should nevertheless be free.21 A negro boy in Upper
Canada who in 1824 still had ten years of servitude before him as the
child of a female slave was "probably... the last slave in Canada".22 In
Lower Canada, slavery was abolished, not by the Legislature, but by
the courts. A bill to abolish slavery was introduced in 1793, but enjoy¬
ed little support. Various bills introduced from 1799 to 1803 have


-----

reality, they were acts to re-establish that institution, under the pre¬
###### text of regulating and limiting it. For the fact was that the courts of
Lower Canada refused to enforce enslavement from 1797, and that
slaves quickly took advantage of this situation to end their own ser¬
vitude. The slave-owners were left, as they said, without protection
or recourse, but public opinion had moved far enough against them
###### that the Legislature refused to correct the courts, so that slavery
disappeared from Lower Canada about 1800 from lack of any means
to enforce it.23

The Unsuitability of Slavery

While French and British settlers in Canada trifled uncertainly with
slavery in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, French and Bri¬
tish settlers in other parts of America were building the most extensive
slave empires since classical times. The justification offered for the
slave system in the southern colonies — the scarcity and expense of
labour — was consistently echoed from Canada. There appears to
have been little moral objection to slavery anywhere until about 1790,
and where slavery proved useful to the ruling group, its popularity
long survived that date. It is not apparent that the problems of obtain¬
ing slaves, and of retaining them, w.ould have provided more difficulty
in Canada than elsewhere. Yet the slave in Canada scarcely ever ap¬
peared beyond the kitchens of a few well-to-do households, and his
###### departure aroused few regrets. Clearly, the Canadian environment
was unsuited to the slave system of providing labour.

A ready reason why this was so, and a partially true one, can be
found in the Canadian climate. The negro fared well enough in the
severe Canadian climate, though the fear that he would not seems to
have been the one ground for hesitation in French consideration of
large-scale slave imports.24 But the climate also confined Canada's
major economic activities to a period of about six months in each year.
The country's employments, therefore, fitted badly with the econom¬
ics of slavery. For the economics of slavery are the economics of over¬
head costs: In return for the services anticipated, the slave-owner
###### must accept a fixed burden in initial and in operating costs; these can¬ not be avoided without damaging or losing the asset. When the over¬
head costs are assumed, the services are available free of further
charges, but must be regularly and fully applied to obtain the maxi¬
mum benefit. The sugar planter certainly was in a better position to
utilize the flow of services continually than was the typical Canadian
employer — only in domestic service, indeed, was the continuous appli¬
cation of services readily made. It is suggestive that other colonies
found slavery unhelpful the more their climates resembled the Canadian


-----

It is clear that the Canadian employer faced handicaps as a slave¬
owner, as compared with his counterpart around the Caribbean. He
had every reason to prefer a free labour market from which to draw
labour as he willed, leaving to the labourer the problem of bearing
overhead costs and surviving, somehow, the slack season. Climate
(seasonality) seems to provide, indeed, all the reasons needed for the
failure of slavery to flourish in Canada. Yet, for all that, it does not
appear to have been the basic reason. However little employers might
wish to bear the overhead costs of labour which they could apply only
a portion of the year, they were compelled to bear those costs in lead¬
ing Canadian employments until the appearance of a plentifully-
supplied labour market in the nineteenth century. They were forced
to undertake year-round costs precisely because labour was scarce and
would not be available at the time and place wanted, if the labourer
was not supported at the time he was not wanted.* Besides, there
always were town handicraft employments of a year-round nature.

The inflexibility and lack of incentive tha characterize slavery seem
to offer a better reason why it did not meet Canadian needs. To be
sure, in the heart of a slave economy, selection and differential status
and lack of other labour resources could lead to the use of slaves as
craftsmen.25 Slaves enjoyed a surprising variety of employments in
New England, possibly because the ubiquity of the slave trade made it
easy for a variety of people to have them.26 Typically, however, the
slave was utilized for field crops in ways that required a minimum of
skill and permitted a maximum of supervision. Slave labour was no¬
toriously unproductive — a common estimate was that the slave did
one-third the work of a free labourer27 — so, to make slavery pay,
the slave had to be used where he stood at the least disadvantage.
When he was used for work that required any degree of skill or initia¬
tive, the reason ordinarily was that free labour was unavailable. Even
in the Southern States, free workmen replaced slaves in semi-skilled
employments when free men were available.28

Now, whatever else might be said of Canada's employments — the
work of the voyageur and bateauman, the lumberman and the
raftsman, the artisan and, indeed, the farmer — they involved a con¬
siderable degree of skill and, still more, they required a high degree of
initiative, independent judgment and mobility. Rarely could super¬
vision substitute for the workman's own willingness to produce. Even
with free labour, employers were continually pressed before the nine¬
###### teenth century to establish mechanisms that would induce assiduity
beyond range of the master's voice.

If slavery could ever have flourished in Canada, it should have
flourished much more readily in Pennsylvania. But it is clear that Penn¬
sylvania's abolition of hereditary slavery in 1780 rested upon the
###### thorough unsuitability of the institution, as well as upon revolution¬
ary and Quaker sentiment.29 In New York —unsentimental New
York many masters have found it for their advantage (1804) to
promise their slaves liberty on condition of serving a few years under
###### indenture this the young are anxious to accept, and the hopes of
freedom makes them better servants in the meantime/'ao New York
already had enjoyed the premonition, if not yet the realization, of a
well-stocked labour market. Canada might hope for one also before
long. But even before a satisfactory labour market appeared, it seems
plain that slavery was uneconomic in Canada.

The Aftermath of Negro Slavery

The abolitionist movement in North America at the end of the eight¬
###### eenth century was, on the whole, a practical, unsentimental and local
affair. Communities judged that slavery did not suit them, but did not
profess to say how the case stood in other parts. But a new kind of
abolitionist movement was already arising and was to become more
and more powerful and vocal through the decades. This movement
was concerned with the sins of others, and its zeal was in proportion
to the distance of the evil from the observer. In England, abolitionist
agitation made easy the destruction of the privileges of the West Indian
planters. In the United States, it was a valuable aid in the drive for
the tariff protection and free labour market conducive to industrial
capitalism.

One consequence of abolitionist activity in the United States was
the northward movement of escaped slaves, and of negroes in general.
Particularly as slave-owners sought to recover their property from
any part of the United States, slaves who escaped were inclined to seek
sanctuary in Canada, usually by crossing the Detroit River frontier.
Before 1835, there were very few negroes in Canada,31 but the influx
###### after that date provoked a violent anti-negro agitation, not unmixed with sympathy for slavery, in the 1840s and 1850s.

The negroes who came to Canada concentrated particularly in the
Western District of Upper Canada, the region along the Detroit River.
It was the part of Canada reached first — perhaps its climate was more
agreeable than elsewhere in Canada — and it soon had a number of
"colonies" of negroes that became the objectives of those in flight.32
The negroes congregated, secondly, in the cities and towns from
###### Toronto westward, and thirdly, in nearby rural areas.33 How many of them there were is a matter of debate. The official count (taken at the


-----

4,200 negroes in Canada West in 1842, and 5,500 in 1848.34 Perhaps
there were about 8,000 in 1852;35 but much higher estimates were
frequently given.36

Anti-negro sentiment flourished in proportion to negro numbers. It
was most violent by far in the Western District, and its pervasiveness
there is apparent by 1840.37 During the next two decades, significant
ways were found to express it. One was a periodic effort by magis¬
###### trates and constables to return escaped slaves to the custody of their
masters in the United States.38 Another consisted in the imposition by
magistrates of savage sentences on negroes for petty offences.39 A
third was the expulsion of negro children from the common schools.
This occurred not only in the Western District,40 but at St. Catharines
in 184241 and at Hamilton in 184 3.42 The provincial school authorities
saw no harm in meeting this difficulty by the provision of segregated
schools,43 a device upheld in the courts by a marvellous stretching of
the law that authorized separate schools for Roman Catholics.44

Landon noted instances between 1849 and 1851 of the exclusion of
negroes from juries, township meetings and the Sons of Temper¬
ance.45 But there was nothing new about this sort of treatment.46
What the publicity of the 1850s seems to mark is a greater public
sympathy for the negro, and advances by the negroes to exploit it.
Abolitionist agitation in the northern States, and the ease with which
employment could be found in the 1850s, may explain the milder
white attitude. By 1853, a protest from the Western District against
the entry of negroes included the proviso that the petitioners
abhorred slavery47 — a sentiment conspicuously absent from many,
if not all, earlier communications. By 1856, magistrates who tried to
###### return an escaped slave to the United States were summarily dismis¬
sed,48 whereas their counterparts a decade before had escaped with a
reprimand.49 Presumably the negroes sensed a more favourable cli¬
mate: it was in the 1850s that they found courage to challenge segrega¬
ted schools in the courts, though the segregation was of long standing.
And in 1858 a negro mob, in the heart of the Western Disctrict, was
bold enough to remove a slave forcibly from his American master.50

It could be said, and was said, that anti-negro feeling was strongest
in the districts settled by Americans, and least in the districts settled
from Great Britain.51 The settlers of American origin, favouring a
lower-middle-class equalitarian democracy, may have suspected a
desire to reduce them to the level of negroes in an hierarchical society.
The less affluent British settlers were likely to fear grasping Ameri¬
cans more than aristocratic Britons or, probably, negroes. But, of
course, it was in American districts that the negroes settled. Perhaps
anti-negro feeling would have been as violent, or more violent, in


-----

T e situation in the towns is clearer. The affluent and secure did
###### not greatly care whether their inferiors were black or white. It was

the middling and lower classes of the whites" who drove the negroes
from the common schools.52 The greatest antagonism was found among

the French-Canadians and Irish"53 — those who competed directly
###### with the negroes for the poorest jobs — as was the case also in the
United States.54 But the relatively secure artisan class probably shared
in some degree the feelings of contemporary American workers: no
sympathy for negroes; indifference to the slavery question; detesta¬
tion of upper-class philanthropists who excited themselves over the
alleged miseries of far-off slaves, but who did nothing to relieve the
wage-slavery on their own doorsteps.55

The Western District, with its extreme and unanimous hostility to
negroes, invites particular attention. The District differed from others
in the mildness of its climate and the nature of its crops: perhaps
slavery would have suited it.56 It felt, with justice, that labour was
always more scarce and expensive in the District than anywhere else
in Canada.57 The inhabitants, then, might have been expected to wel¬
come an ample supply of negro labourers. And there is something to
###### support this view of them. The fact is that the negroes of the area
were not commonly forced upon the labour market, but were insula¬
ted from it in the colonies established by missionaries and philanthro¬
pists. And the colonies drew a very large share of the abuse originating
in the District; whereas, if the white inhabitants had merely been
anxious to have negroes out of their sight, they should have welcomed
the settlement system. But, on the other hand, negro employment
was not much encouraged — indeed, farmers were inclined to agree
among themselves to employ no negroes whatever.58

The inhabitants' case, as they stated it themselves, was that the
negroes frightened off the British artisans whom they wished to settle
among them. The negroes were a shiftless, immoral lot, addicted to
###### petty crime, avoided as neighbours by immigrants. Above all, artisans
were unwilling to settle where they faced the prospect of negro competi¬
tion.59 The arguments have limited merit, but they do suggest that the
typical citizen was a simple yeoman who aspired to the ownership of a
farm rather than of a plantation, and wanted a free (white) labour
market.

The negroes regarded Canada as a temporary rather than a perma¬
###### nent place of residence, at least in the early years.60 They showed a strong desire to abandon its unfriendly atmosphere in favour of a more
hospitable environment.61 The outcome of the American Civil War
cut off negro immigration and led many negroes to return to the United
States.62 There was left only a negro residue, and a persisting hostility

of the forces making for a free labour market, with a labour force un¬
divided in respect to race.

###### Indentured Servants

The typical immigrant to the Caribbean region before 1800 was a slave,
but the typical immigrant to more northerly colonies was an inden¬
tured servant. The indenture system played a predominant part in the
early peopling of the United States.63* In the seventeenth century,
it provided a similar service for New France, but its place in the eight¬
eenth century was much reduced. The reason was that France exper¬
ienced labour shortage in the eighteenth century (as against a surplus
in the seventeenth), so that workers for Canada had either to be de¬
ported by force or beguiled with contracts generous far beyond the
typical indenture.64

Barring kidnapping (of which there was probably a good deal), the
indenture system required a European so despairing of the Old World
and hopeful of the New that he would contract his labour for a period
of future years in return for a passage to America, his keep and,
perhaps, some stated amount of wages. It required a prospective em¬
ployer willing to pay a substantial sum for this sort of servant. And it
required, of course, a vessel master willing to do a business in immi¬
grants. The indenture form resembled that of an apprentice, but the
servant usually was an adult who made his own contract and posses¬
sed already whatever skill he would ever have.65 Economically, the
indentured servant accepted the position of a slave — a slave with a
termination date to his servitude, but a slave, nevertheless.66 The
master likewise assumed the rights and duties of a slave-owner. He
had to assume the initial and overhead costs of the servant, and it was
his obligation to find employment for the servant that would make the
investment pay. Nevertheless, demand was brisk in the eighteenth
century, and the indenture traffic was taken over by enterprising
specialists who provided the capital, enlisted the servants and auc¬
tioned their human stock in American ports.67

Despite its early popularity, the indenture system was falling into
disfavour by 1800,68 and the regular large-scale traffic in servants
failed to survive the glutted market of 1819.69 While this glut, which
forced the indenture entrepreneurs to the desperate expedient of
releasing the servants from their indentures, was the result of depres¬
sion, it also signified something more fundamental and lasting: the

tion to pre-revolutionary America came as indentured servants. See Henry

appearance of a well-stocked free labour market in America. The main
factor in stocking that market was the sharp drop in ocean fares as
shipowners sought return cargo for the rapidly-mounting volume of
bulky goods shipped from America to Europe. The willingness of
English ratepayers, Irish landlords, and friendly societies to pay the
lowered fares for poor emigrants also contributed. Increasingly, the
American employer found his convenience best served by hiring
labour when he happened to want it, rather than retaining a supply
###### that was often unusable. There remained, to be sure, one advantage to
the indenture system that continued to fascinate a great many pro¬
spective employers: the ignorant and defenceless European could be
induced to sign a contract at wage rates far below those in America.
But as the free market and the area of settlement expanded, this ap¬
###### parent advantage increasingly proved to be illusory. The servant soon
learned enough of wage rates in America to consider himself the
victim of sharp practice. He could also observe that the settled area of
America was amply large to lose oneself in. The servant had two effec¬
tive courses open to him. One was to make himself thoroughly dis¬
agreeable. "Captain M. [Miles MacDonell] in returning from Scotland
in 1790 — brought some indentured men — bound for 4 years — but
they became discontented and so troublesome that he gave them up
most of their time — they had nothing by their bargain to expect at the
end of their time."70 The other course was to desert. "Several hundred
were brought over in this way in 1829 by the builders of the Chesa¬
peake and Ohio Canal. No sooner did they land than many of them
deserted and the agent went again to Liverpool in search of others."71

These hazards were enough to keep small employers from trying to
import indentured labour. They preferred to agitate for more immi¬
gration, subsidized if possible from Great Britain. From the 1820s
onwards, unskilled labour was usually in good, and often in excess,
supply in Canada. If an employer was willing to pay good wages and to
make his wants known,72 he had a good prospect of obtaining a full
(though not very dependable) labour force.73 Indentures in the old
style survived only in such a specialized field as the importation of
###### pauper children as apprentices.74 Yet the fascination of the system is
illustrated by various grandiose schemes that were proposed as the
###### nineteenth century struggled to clarify its thinking about colonies and
emigration and labour, while the inappropriateness of the system in
the new age also emerges from them.

The most comprehensive of the nineteenth-century schemes was
the colonization plan of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. It was, among
###### other things, a plan to introduce indentured labour into the colonies
on a gigantic scale.75 Wakefield knew, as others sometimes did not,

viewpoint because of the alternative opportunities available to the
servant. Hence, he proposed the best-known feature of his scheme,
pricing land beyond the reach of the poor, so as to leave the servant no
choice but to remain with his employer — or, at any rate, some em¬
ployer— for several years.76 Wakefield did not explain, however, how
his plan could be made to work in Canada, while cheap land remained
readily available across the border in the United States.

There were many other plans. One was proposed by Robert Gour-
lay in 1822.77 It depended on public works designed to improve the
St. Lawrence, then the subject of considerable discussion. Gourlay
proposed bringing out 5,000 men from the United Kingdom to dig the
canals, under contracts or indentures by which the costs of their pas¬
sages would be deducted from their wages, and another substantial
part of the wages evidently withheld. But Gourlay proposed to pay
going wages and to offer year-round employment. He calculated that
his immigrants could be released after about eighteen months, with
ten pounds each in their pockets, to settle or to seek other work. They
would then be replaced by other labourers brought out in the same
way.

The promoters of the Great Western Railway, in the course of the
early difficulties of that railroad, put forward a plan of this sort in
1847.78 It was suggested in part by the famine in Ireland. Spokesmen
for the Great Western professed to be deeply concerned for the un¬
happy famine victims, and they said, truly enough, that only railroad
construction could offer large-scale employment for them in Canada.
All that the Company wanted was a loan of £800,000 sterling at no
interest for the first two years. With this money, it would bring out
10,000 labourers with their families (50,000 people altogether) and
purchase up to one million acres of land from the Province. The
labourers would be imported under a contract providing that their
wages, over and above subsistence, would be held and applied (1) to
pay for their passages and (2) to buy land. The Company considered
###### that the labourers would stick by their contracts rather than forfeit
their land claims, and thus would be retained in Canada instead of
going to the United States. Though the labourer would thus become
"the consumer of British manufactures, and a producer of surplus
agricultural products...", the British government (which was looked
to for the loan) said "No."

All the same, the Colonial Office at this time had a lively interest in
schemes involving Irish emigration and indentured labour. Despite
Wakefield's opinion that Lord Grey was no friend of his projects,79
Grey declared his sympathy for Wakefield's ideas,80 and showed that
he was interested in plans for large-scale migration. One plan discus¬
was to Halifax Quebec railroad employing no


-----

###### than 24,000 "wild Irish of the Western Counties" enlisted in semi¬
military labour units for seven years.82 What seems to have been a
variant is "Colonel Tulloch's Plan for the formation of a Corps of
Military Labourers in the Colonies" to be used in building roads and
bridges.82 These plans envisaged holding labourers to a low level of
wages and inducing them to purchase land in Canada.

London demonstrated a remarkable attachment to the notion that
immigrant labourers could be made to invest heavily in land. A great
###### part of the investment in Canadian lands had, indeed, been made by
immigrants with savings from their wages, and with obviously bene¬
ficial effects. If nearly all immigrants could be made to buy land, a much
###### greater share of British emigration could be saved for the British colo¬
nies instead of ending in the United States. And the further thought
keeps peeping out, that somehow through this mechanism, Canadian
public works could be paid for by the reserves of unalienated land.83
So the schemes involved paying off labourers with land instead of
money, despite objections argued from Canada.84 On the other hand,
the Colonial Office appreciated that men indentured at inferior con¬
ditions in Canada would desert to the United States. This seems to
have been the reason for planning military units: presumably it was
expected that military discipline and sanctions could force labourers to
observe unattractive contracts.85 The expectation was not shared in
Canada. The Canadian government (R.B. Sullivan) argued that if the
men in these units could not escape, they would likely use violence and
become dangerous to the country.86 Whether or not the objections
were appreciated, the plans were singularly unsuited to the labour
market conditions that existed in 1848, and could hardly have pro¬
duced anything but trouble if they had been tried.

What the labour market permitted and sometimes encouraged,
however, was a very much milder form of the indenture system, the
"contract labour" system. Just as the indenture system flourished
while there was a real need for it — that is, while its purpose was to
overcome a genuine shortage of labour, and not merely to cut wages
— the contract labour system seems to have answered well when used
to meet a real labour shortage. In the nineteenth century in Canada,
periodic shortages of skilled labour could occur, even though labour
in general was plentiful. Such shortages were likely when a new
economic activity of unusual type or size was undertaken.

New France in the eighteenth century provides a striking example
in miniature of the problem of skilled labour shortage and the use of
contract labour to overcome it. It does not seem to have been very dif¬
ficult to obtain unskilled labour in the colony. Skilled labour, however,
was another matter. If the skilled labour was wanted for an employ¬


-----

###### that not one practitioner of the craft would be found.87 The lack of
pressure in France, or of attraction to the colony, made it improbable
also that skilled workers would emigrate on their own initiative,
even if they knew of opportunities in New France.88 The only way
left to obtain skilled workers was to bring them from France, under
contracts very favourable to the workmen. Whether it is the really
substantial industries that were made to flourish in New France (the
shipyards and ironworks), or ephemeral ventures like ropeworks and
brickworks, the records tell of importations of skilled workers to start
them. The industries that persisted required continued importations
to keep them going, still under contracts at high wages.89

In the nineteenth century, it was railroads that were most likely to
occasion a sudden large demand for labour, including skilled labour. A
railroad company was in a position to undertake large-scale impor¬
tation of labour to satisfy its own needs; and its monopsonistic position
assured that the labour it brought out would very probably continue
in its employment, given reasonable conditions.90 Railroads were, in
fact, very prominent importers of contract labour into Canada. In
1854, the Grand Trunk Railroad undertook to bring out to Canada no
less than 4,000 construction workers, engine drivers, engine fitters
and similar artisans, and labourers. "Constant employment has been
guaranteed by the contractors to steady men for five years. The pas¬
sage money of those who cannot pay it, as well as of their wives and
children, is defrayed for them, on condition of the men being under
stoppage of a shilling a day each, until the debt is liquidated."91 The
Great Western Railway earlier brought out men, apparently about
one-third of its staff, but possibly more—probably under a similar
###### arrangement.92 The Canadian Pacific Railway took the same course to
staff its Angus Shops in Montreal in the 1880s.93

Though these arrangements involved the importation of workmen
under contract, as did the indenture system, the obligations imposed
on employer and on employee were very much lighter. While the em¬
ployers perhaps used the system to lower wages, or to prevent their
rising, they do not appear to have been high-handed in this respect.
Actual (absolute) shortages of skilled labour provided their primary
motivation.94 The men brought out by the railroads seem to have
###### thought themselves well treated, and the system worked satisfac¬
torily.

There may, on the other hand, have been a good deal of importation
of contract labour by smaller employers in which the motive was to
get very cheap labour. Canadian wage earners, at any rate, expressed
###### that opinion. Of course, they did not in any case wish to have their
bargaining position weakened by new competitors. Organized labour

tion to contract labour, as it did also to immigration subsidized by the
federal or provincial governments. The employer interest in Canada
was, however, much too strong to allow any success to the demand
###### that the importation of contract labour be made illegal, and this was
still one of the unrealized goals of the labour movement in 1902.95

Convict Labour

Edward Gibbon Wakefield was acutely conscious of the fact that mo¬
dern slavery arose from the shortage of labour in new countries.96 He
classified modern slaves as consisting of (l) negroes, (2) indentured
servants and (3) convict labourers.97 He was particularly concerned
over the use of convict labour in Australia, and gave a striking descrip¬
tion of the slave economy which had been able to develop in Tasmania
because of the availability of convicts.96 He noted that those who pro¬
fited by the deportation of convicts from Great Britain sought the
continuance of their labour supply, while other colonies not yet fa¬
voured begged to have convict slaves sent to them.99

Canada, during the French period, had considerable acquaintance
with deported convict labour. This developed from the circumstance
###### that, in the eighteenth century, France was short of labour relative to
demand, so that the voluntary emigration to New France of the pre¬
ceding century was not continued on any scale.100 After 1715, the fail¬
ure of indentured servant schemes to provide much labour for New
France was counteracted increasingly by the deportation of convicts.
In the 1720s, the convicts were mostly petty criminals. They were to
be bound as indentured servants to masters in New France for five
years. However, these newcomers proved to be far more adept at
crime than at work, and the outcry that resulted led to the substitu¬
tion of other types of criminal. Already in 1728 there had been sent
prisoners convicted of "minor crimes such as poaching and wife beat-
ing".101 And from 1729 to 1743, prime reliance was put upon the faux
saunier, the person who had been convicted of evading the salt tax, but
who, for all that, was likely to be sober and industrious. This type of
convict labourer was eagerly sought in New France in the early 1730s,
###### when the country experienced a decided boom. The smaller numbers
imported after 1733 appear to reflect crop failures and poorer busi¬
ness conditions rather than dissatisfaction with these convict labour¬
ers. War ended this traffic from 1744. The supply of faux sauniers, about
six hundred altogether, could not have had a very pronounced effect
on the labour market. Moreover, many of the convicts, apparently
###### under the slightest of supervision, soon left the labour market in one
way or another; and these immigrants were rarely capable of meeting
New France's really acute need for skilled labour.102


-----

1760. Nor, for eighty years, did local convicts have any notable share
in it. There were indeed criminals, but the tone and circumstances
of the age were inimical to the use of their labour for commercial
purposes. Though gaols were .crowded, they could not be said to be
heavily-populated, so that the desirability of regular routine and activity
did not suggest itself. Neither did employment seem appropriate for
those who suddenly and temporarily overflowed the gaols after riots
and political disturbances. The public's attitude was one of detach¬
ment. The citizen was reluctant to pay for the care of convicts, and he
was indifferent to their miseries; but he was not interested, on the
###### other hand, in imposing any particular order upon them. As for gaol¬
ers, they thought they had their hands full preventing escapes, and
saw no reason for multiplying their difficulties by unnecessary inter¬
ference with the prisoners' existence.103

In the second quarter of the nineteenth century there was in Can¬
ada, as elsewhere, a drastic change in the prison order. It developed
both from new public attitudes and from matter-of-fact material cir¬
cumstances. With respect to the latter, the growth of population and
of cities involved a rapid increase in the number of convicts. The gaols
were more and more overcrowded. And as time went on, most of
them were more and more tumble-down and easy to escape from.
Additional prison room had to be provided somewhere. But the heavi¬
ly crowded condition of the gaols drew the attention of gaolers and
officials, at least, to something else: the desirability of some means of
segregating different classes of inmates. Fepaale prisoners should, of
course, be segregated from males.104 Insane persons in the prisons
created exceptional difficulties and, from the 1830s, there were ef¬
forts in Upper Canada to segregate them in an "asylum" under medi¬
cal care.105 Finally, there was appreciation at least from the 1830s
of the distinction between minor offenders on the one hand and
"hardened criminals" on the other. To segregate these, and relieve pres¬
sure on the gaols,106 Upper Canada accepted the necessity for a peni¬
tentiary. The penitentiary was built near Kingston in 1834 (though a
good deal of the original plan was not followed for reasons of econ¬
omy), and the first prisoners were received on June 1, 1835.107 By
1836, there were over eighty convicts, and about the same number
appeared in each of the next few years, except for the crowding occa¬
sioned by the Rebellion of 1837.108 After the Union of the provinces,
the penitentiary received convicts from the eastern province also
(1842), so that it was crowded to its capacity of 150. A program of en¬
largement was pursued through the 1840s.109

The penitentiary was more than a product of administrative neces¬
sity, however. It was a mark of a new spirit of puritanism and efficien¬

From the beginning, those appointed to supervise the penitentiary
were keen students of prison discipline" — penology is an approxi¬
mate equivalent which implied that prisoners should be, and could
be, reformed. They followed contemporary discussion and experiment
in the United States with close attention.111

From the doctrines of prison discipline, but even more, from the
difficulty of getting money from the Legislature to run the peniten¬
tiary,112 the Commissioners were anxious from the beginning to put
###### their charges to remunerative work. Workshops, part of the original
plan of the penitentiary hitherto neglected for reasons of "economy",
were built in 1839 by convict labour,112 and from this time on some
###### measure of craft training was provided in the prison shops. In 1839,
the penitentiary was prepared to hire out to private employers an
imposing variety of workers: blacksmiths, tinsmiths, stone cutters,
masons, lathers, carpenters, painters, tailors, shoemakers, ropemak-
ers, labourers and quarrymen, seamstresses, cooks, and nurses.114 In
practice, the most important commercial product of prison labour in
1839 was shoes.115 In the same year, the penitentiary embarked on
rope making,116 an internal manufacture carried on pretty regularly
###### thereafter.

What were the artisans of Canada, and of Kingston in particular,
likely to think of this competition offered by convict labour? Else¬
###### where the energetic commercialization of convict labour brought
quick protests from free workers, and a long vendatta followed. In the
United States, by 1842, "the competition of prison labour had reached
the point where, for the first time, an organized protest of consider¬
able weight was made." This, a veritable labour movement in its own
###### right, started in Buffalo and reached its peak in 1847.117 If workmen
had not been greatly disturbed in the same period over the competi¬
tion of new machines and of cheap immigrant labour, the movement
against convict labour might have been still more powerful. But a
petition of Kingston mechanics (carpenters and joiners) of 1842 is
against the displacement of artisans by machinery, not against con¬
victs.118 At the end of 1844, Kingston shoemakers petitioned against
the competition of American shoe imports, "the larger portion of which
as they believe is made up in the Penitentiaries of that Country, by the
labor of the Convicts confined therein...", but Canadian convict
labour was not mentioned.119 A similar petition at the same time from
Belleville shoemakers against American leather imports failed to men¬
tion convict labour in either country.120 These petitions were, in fact,


-----

i

tive industry in Canada in the 1840s, and they were successful in win¬
ning discriminatory duties against American leather products.121 It
was not until 1850, fifteen years after the opening of the penitentiary,
###### that the Kingston craftsmen formally complained of the competition
in their local market of convict-made shoes, clothing, chairs, iron¬
works and other items.122

This long delay might suggest that the Canadian mechanic did not
fear the competition of convict labour, or that he was singularly ob¬
tuse. But the facts reveal a different explanation for this long silence.
For fifteen years the (more or less Conservative) management of the
penitentiary had quietly arranged to minimize the amount of actual
convict competition on the labour market in return for the tacit
agreement of the artisans to accept what competition there was.

Back in 1836, when the penitentiary had barely opened, James Nick-
alls was recommended as President of the Board of Penitentiary
Commissioners (and was subsequently appointed) because:

1. He is in a manner the Head of the Mechanics — i.e. they all
look up to him for advice in their affairs.

2. Having a Mechanical turn he would be exceedingly useful to the
Board, in devising proper modes of employing the Convicts so
as to render their labour productive, and at the same time, as
little offensive and injurious to the mechanics as possible.123

In the same year an investigation was undertaken into the feasibili¬
ty of moving the penitentiary to the elaborate iron and other works
erected at Marmora in the 1820s and then abandoned. No doubt there
was a wish to realize something from the equipment and buildings at
Marmora, and to make Upper Canada an iron producer, but the major
motive was frankly stated: "the intense anxiety of feeling which pre¬
vails among the Mechanics of the Province, whose interests it is ap¬
prehended will be unfavourably affected by the present Penitentiary
system, if continued."124 The difficulties of the move to Marmora
were considered too formidable, however, and the project was aban¬
doned.

The inauguration of rope manufacture within the penitentiary in
1839 had the same object of avoiding direct competition with free art¬
isans.125 Unfortunately, the rope produced proved to be hard to sell.126
The real solution found for the problem seems to have been internal
construction in the penitentiary using convict labour. Despite the
###### other kinds of employment mentioned, it appears that most of the
prison labour was used in this way in 1839.127 In 1842 also, when the
arrival of Lower Canada's convicts invited expansion, the labour was


-----

still building away.129 It looks very much as if the penitentiary author¬
ities kept their charges to internal construction work throughout the
1840s, and that they judiciously avoided hiring out more than a token
force of convicts to compete with free labour.

This policy satisfied Canada's free workmen and probably contri¬
buted a good deal to the solidity of the Conservative hold on the King¬
ston region. No doubt those in charge of the penitentiary could have
gone on indefinitely devising uses for convict labour that did not con¬
flict with free workmen. Their policy was overturned, however, by
the rise of a powerful "reform" sentiment: a general "reform" move¬
###### ment in Canada and elsewhere associated with the development of in¬
dustrial capitalism, and the specific Clear Grit movement of Canada
West.

Increasingly through the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s, Canadians were
adopting the pushing puritanical attitudes appropriate to industrial
capitalism. The demand of middle-class groups for exclusive political
power, the interest in mechanical inventions, the spreading gospel of
efficiency, were aspects of this development. Another, and a good
###### barometer of the spread of industrial capitalist attitudes, was the rise
of the temperance movement.* Only an occasional Temperance
Society appeared in the 1830s,13° but in the 1840s there was a wide¬
spread campaign to render the labouring classes more industrious and
obedient by removing liquor from their reach.131 When a profitable
cash market for grain developed in the 1850s, there appeared a really
powerful temperance movement, reaching peaks (if one may judge from
the avalanches of petitions directed to the province's administration)
in 1852 and 1856.132 Temperance agitators were at pains throughout
to claim a close relationship between intemperance and crime and the
large prison population.133

Prison administration was not exempt from the new interest. In the
earliest days of the penitentiary there had been "reform" discussion
among the officials. Methods of "discipline" were viewed in terms
of their effectiveness in making prisoners, upon their release, into
###### honest and industrious persons. In 1839, the Penitentiary Inspectors
observed, acutely, that among philanthropists in Europe and America
the subject of discipline had got on much faster than that of reform.
They thought reform was likely to be effective only with a probation
system to watch over prisoners after their discharge. To promote the
attractiveness of the straight and narrow path, they suggested with¬
holding part of the earnings of prisoners, and paying the money in

i
instalments after discharge. Following the prison chaplain, it was
proposed that sentences not shorter than three years nor longer than
seven years were most likely to make prisoners receptive to refor¬
mation.134 The Inspectors reflected the new age in their view that men's
behaviour was conditioned by their environment, that prisoners could
be reformed; and in their desire for efficiency and economy, by avoid¬
ing recidivism. But these were rather private and practical discussions
among relatively informed and responsible men.

But now another, public sort of interest in prison reform arose.
There came first, in 1846, an outcry against the whipping of women
prisoners. The Warden explained that women were rarely beaten
with a rawhide whip, being punished usually by confinement in a dark
cellar on bread and water for 24 or 48 hours; and that male prisoners
were usually whipped with a rawhide whip, rarely with the cat.135 But
the Executive Council appeared to doubt that the public would be sa¬
tisfied with this explanation, for in January 1847, it limited and regu¬
lated the methods of corporal punishment at the penitentiary.136 At
the same time, more attention was paid to the prison diet, and a hos¬
pital within the penitentiary was planned.137 The unhappy prison of¬
ficials, accepting the proposition that the lash "is repugnant to the
feelings of the Public", substituted "the Box", a form of confinement
originated in the penal establishments of Tasmania, despite the
doubts expressed by Governor and Council. The officials pleaded that
they had to have some method of punishment.138

The "public" next, in 1849, subjected the Executive to a barrage of
petitions for the abolition of capital punishment, as ineffectual, de¬
moralizing, possibly applied to the wrong persons, and "opposed to
the spirit of Christianity".139 The sentimentality in these attacks,
###### another symptom of the age, should not obscure the practical goal of
efficiency in keeping prisoners alive, healthy and well-fed, and free
from physical abuse, not only so that they might be efficient workmen
to supply the labour market upon their release, but also so that they
might make a similar contribution during their time of servitude.

Until 1849, these attacks had made little impression on the position
of the entrenched prison authorities; but in that year the most ardent
spokesmen of the new era realized their ambition to give the peniten¬
tiary a thorough overhauling. A special Commission of Inquiry was
established, with George Brown as secretary. Its report sorrowfully
pointed out that segregation of different classes of criminals had still
not proceeded far in Canada; that as a consequence, young offenders
who might have been saved, were led by evil companions to a life of
crime; and that the penitentiary, the "one penal Institution of which
the aim is reform", had not in practice contributed much to that cause.
The reason for this was that the penitentiary relied upon the negative


-----

powers of severe punishment, rather than on measures to lead the
prisoners to a better attitude.140

There was good sense in this. The financial saving from reducing
recidivism was particularly likely to appeal to bustling Reformers. But
the humamtarianism expressed seems forced and artificial. Beneath
the facade, more practical and immediate objects indeed were in view.
One of them was to blast the Conservative officials out of the peniten¬
tiary, and generally upset the happy family relationships by which the
Kingston area was kept a Conservative stronghold.141 But an even
more important object, it may be suspected, was to force prison labour
on the market to the greatest possible extent. If the penitentiary could
not be made to pay, at least the burden on the taxpayer would be light¬
ened, and, at the same time, wages would be forced downward on the
free labour market. These advantages could hardly fail to recommend
reform to George Brown. Early in 1850, Brown was able to write an
editorial congratulating the new Commissioners upon their efforts to
introduce the "new spirit" and their success in having cut costs by 35
per cent.

The Inspectors are entitled to some credit also for the in¬
troduction and establishment of the contract labour system,
often and again, but unsuccessfully, tried to be commenced by
their predecessors. A contract for 100 convict shoemakers is now
in operation, and another for 50 cabinet-makers, for whose use
costly machinery has been erected by the contractors. A further
contract for 50 tailors has just been signed, and one for 50 black¬
smiths is now negotiating ...142

Presumably this exhausted the able-bodied convicts, and Brown
informs us that the new administration was also seeking employment
for the semi-invalids. The same editorial expressed pleasure at the
decrease in the use of corporal punishment, which, of course, might
have interfered with employment.

Reform had accomplished its object — it is significant that the "pub¬
lic" sent in no more petitions about prisons, though it found plenty of
other causes to uphold in the 1850s — and contract convict labour was
to be a feature of Canadian life for many decades. Nobody thought
it necessary to ask what the convicts thought of the system. But the
new order was not established without an opposing petition from
several hundred "Inhabitants of Kingston". The petition was directed
"against the teaching of trades at the Provincial Penitentiary"; and since
this teaching had been undertaken in the name of reform, the petition¬
ers felt it necessary to declare that the "reformation" anticipated from


-----

But what the Kingston mechanics particularly objected to was that

the Convict labour being hired out to contractors for the manu¬
facture of such articles as are in more general domestic use, estab¬
lishments for the disposal by retail, within this City, of Convict
made Boots and Shoes, ready made Clothing, Chairs, Cabinet¬
makers ware. Blacksmiths Work, and various other articles are
now in full operation; this has had the effect of driving a large
number of our Mechanics from the City and neighborhood, by
lowering the price of articles manufactured... to a price at which
they cannot be produced by an honest Mechanic, having a family
to support...143

The petition was, of course, ineffectual. Brown had assured the
continuance of the new system by entering into contracts for prison
labour for five years; and in 1851 the main contract was extended to
1860. The Conservatives found that the extension had been effected
###### without inviting others to bid; they calculated that the contract was
too favourable to the contractor by $150,000; and they wondered how
much George Brown had been paid by the beneficiary.144 But it is
doubtful whether they were anxious to abandon the new system it¬
self. It is doubtful, too, whether in the booming years of the 1850s
even the Kingston mechanics felt convict competition very severely.
But the same boom permitted mechanics to express their feelings with
relative impunity. In the fall of 1853, masons building a bridge across
the Humber River for the "Guelph railroad" struck against the use of
stone worked by convict labour.145 It is interesting that others be¬
sides mechanics could find their interest affected by convict labour. In
1856, steam power for manufacturing was installed in the peniten¬
tiary. One result was a set of petitions, circulated in various parts of
Canada West and signed by merchants and manufacturers who
owned steam engines. The petitioners asserted that penitentiary
competition with their businesses was unfair, and stated that such
competition was prohibited in the United States.146

When Canadian workingmen achieved a sufficient degree of organi¬
zation to provide a means of expressing their common sentiments, they
took up the convict labour question vigorously. Almost the first act of
the first meeting of the Canadian Labour Union, in 1873, was the
appointment of a Committee on Prison Labour.147 The Committee
denounced the policy of the Inspector of Prisons: "simply to make the
prisoner self-sustaining during the period of his incarceration". They
protested especially against teaching trades to convicts "as in a great
measure placing a premium on crime, which system unscrupulous men
are not slow in taking advantage of for the aggrandizement of their
own pockets and to the detriment of the honest labourer."148 At each


-----

succeeding meeting of the Canadian Labour Union-that is, annually
to 1877 —similar resolutions against convict labour were passed, a
special vehemence being contributed sometimes by Kingston dele¬
gates. 149 The successor organization, the Canadian Trades and Labour
Congress, took up the work in its turn. Whereas it had been proposed in
the 1870s to confine convicts to road work, or to require articles made
by them to be sold at the outside price, the Congress suggested use of
the union label to direct consumers away from convict-made goods,
and exclusive employment of convicts to make articles required by
###### government offices.150 However, as the perennial resolutions indicate,
organized labour was entirely unsuccessful in curtailing the com¬
mercialization of convict labour in the nineteenth century.

But there is one modification required to this record of failure, and
one other episode in the history of convict labour that merits recital. It
concerns the Toronto Trades Assembly, organized in 1871, and main-
spring of the Canadian Labour Union which the Assembly organized in
1873. Nearly a year before the first meeting of the CLU, the Toronto
Assembly dispatched a delegation to remonstrate with the Ontario
###### government over a decision to contract the labour of the province's
Central Prison to tne Canada Car Company for fifteen years. Meetings
with the Attorney General failed to alter the plan to hire out Ontario's
prisoners, and the Assembly planned a mass meeting of protest.151 But
then, something odd happened. The meeting was postponed; and when
it reappeared, it became a mass meeting to discuss a Mechanics' Lien
Law, to discuss the Master and Servant Act, to discuss nearly everything
except convict labour, which was given a very minor place.152 Moreover,
from this time forward the Assembly conspicuously avoided mention of
convict labour. The Toronto delegates joined, of course, in the annual
resolutions on this subject of the Canadian Labour Union, and in Jan¬
###### uary 1878, in the last months of the Assembly's existence, a protest was entered against a proposal that the City of Toronto use prison labour
for some of its work.153 But in five to six years of the Assembly's min¬
utes, there is not another single reference to convicts. It looks very
much as if a deal had been quietly arranged between the practical men of
the Toronto Assembly and the practical men of the Ontario govern¬
ment. The trade unionists made no more fuss about convict labour. In
###### return, the Ontario government provided a Mechanics' Lien Act in 1873
and amended the Master and Servant Act in 18 76.154 These were im¬
###### portant gains; and they indicate, if the reconstruction of events offered
here is correct, that the Ontario workingman of the nineteenth century
did not come off badly in the contest over convict labour, after all.

A Note on the Role of the Aborigines*


-----

and most parts of the United States, endeavour to exterminate the
aboriginal inhabitants of the country. Neither did they undertake to
reduce the aborigines to slavery or serfdom, as was done in Latin Amer¬
ica: Canadian efforts to enslave, like those of New Englanders, were
early and half-hearted. But the Canadian settlers were no more senti¬
mental about their natives than were Europeans elsewhere. The In¬
dians were preserved in the interest of the fur trade, and there was a
marked reluctance to maintain them any longer when that trade passed.
That Indians were not formally enslaved, then, depended on the fact
###### that they provided a far more satisfactory labour force for the fur trade
on a "free" basis. The Indian was skilled in taking pelts and certainly
required no instruction from the European. The industry, by its nature,
was highly dispersed. Native dependence on trade goods provided an
unrivalled incentive mechanism. Finally, the producer was skilled in
supporting himself from the sparse but unappropriated resources of the
country, so that bargains extraordinarily favourable to the European
could be driven without destroying the labour force. Even so, the Eur¬
opean sometimes passed this limit and a particular segment of the
labour force perished.

The relationship established between the fur traders and their
aboriginal labour force, then, certainly was not one of slavery, though
it has sometimes been loosely characterized as such. Slavery involves
a high degree of direction and of care of the slave, both of which are
lacking here. The relationship, again, obviously was not that of indus¬
trial capitalism — the trader did not buy labour time. A paternalistic
aspect of the relation between traders and Indians, very often present,
might suggest a feudal relationship, with the Indians as serfs. But
there are so many ways in which relations between whites and Indians
differed from those which are usually called "feudal" that this descrip¬
tion seems unhelpful. It may be observed that if the fur trade had been
organized on a basis of slavery, or of serfdom, or of wage labour, the
costs of production would almost certainly (in every case) have been
much higher and the profits correspondingly lower.

Of the types of organization familiar to European society, the
merchant-employer system of commercial capitalism is closest to the
relationship established between merchants and the Canadian abori¬
gines. Of the relationships favoured by Europeans overseas, the closest
parallel is with the tribute system imposed on Oriental peoples, and
with trading systems for commodities in the Orient that approached
closely to the collection of tribute. It is significant that these relation¬
ships were built up during Europe's mercantile period. The tribute

system could be considered a merchant-employer system in which the
bargaining advantage is so overwhelmingly on one side that goods are
obtained with no payment whatever in return. The Russians conduct¬
ed a good deal of their fur business on this basis. But costs of collection
are likely to be quite high in a tribute system. A smaller outlay on force
directed not to obtain unrequited tribute, but to induce "voluntary"
tra ing on extremely disadvantageous terms, seems usually to have
proved more profitable. In general, this is the arrangement the Euro¬
pean peoples sought to impose on their neighbours in the mercantile
period, and it is the arrangement they were successful in imposing on
###### Oriental peoples and on Canada's Indians.

###### CHAPTER II

 The Pre-Industrial Pattern: Personal Labour Relationships

Slavery provided a means to overcome an actual or apprehended
shortage of labour. In Canada it played a minor part in the organiza¬
tion of the labour force. But it was only in the nineteenth century, and
in the latter half of it rather than the first, that Canada approached the
classical (abundant) labour market of industrial capitalism. Historical¬
ly, that labour market depended upon the creation and continuance of
a large enough labour force that employers could always hire the
number of workers wanted, whenever they were wanted. This con¬
dition, in turn, required such obstacles to the acquisition of property
###### that the labour market could not be unduly depleted by the escape of
wage earners to remunerative self-employment. These conditions
were met after 1850, and existed in parts of the Canadian economy
earlier. They permitted employers to force workmen to bear their
own overhead costs, and yet to be available for use, even for very
short periods. The advantage of this arrangement to the employer
was particularly momentous in Canada, whose climatic variations
promoted peaks of employment in the year lasting a few months or
even a few weeks.1

But there was a long period in Canadian development during which
the labour supply (especially of most kinds of skilled workers) was not
abundant enough to permit a free labour market. The employer who
###### thought to escape the overhead costs of labour by pulling a worker
from a pool, just at the moment and for the moment that he happened
to want him, was taking a gamble in which the odds were against suc¬
cess. The chances of failure mounted if the employer had to obtain a
particular quality or kind of labour, and if he required his labour in a
remote location. The disability undoubtedly discouraged economic
activities that would have been undertaken if labour had been more
plentiful. But it also led employers, when the prospects of profit justi¬
fied the course, to act positively to recruit and retain an appropriate


-----

slaves, but it has been observed that they did not choose this solution.
They had another way, a well-integrated system of organizing labour,
###### that was a feature of several important employments till about 1850.

In this system, the employer had first of all to catch his labourer,
perhaps by recruiting in Europe, with consequent expense and delay.
The essence of the system lay, however, in the measures adopted to
hold the labourer when he was caught. The employer had to offer con¬
tinuous employment, or regular employment over a substantial part
of the year: that is, he assumed the overhead costs of the labourer.
There might be periods during which the employer could not use his
workman; still, the workman had to be kept when not wanted, so that
he would be available when wanted.2 But there was a countervailing
advantage to the employer: the same imperfect labour market that
forced the employer to cling to a particular employee, similarly forced
the employee to cling to his employer, for lack of alternative ones.

The economic relationship was thus one of mutual dependence,
with limited alternatives on both sides. But unlike the notoriously
impersonal relationships of industrial capitalism— following from
unlimited alternatives—personal and institutional relationships also
developed in this system. The employee, tied to one employer, usually
made himself submissive and agreeable. The employer, deprived of the
sanction of dismissal, substituted positive incentives to induce conscien¬
tious work. These incentives were developed through the techniques
of personal leadership on which reliance for results is still placed in
most non-economic institutions. To win enthusiastic support, the em¬
ployer-leader endeavoured to display superior energy, intelligence and
fairness. He cultivated desired attitudes by an abundance of personal
(superior-inferior) contacts; by expressing and demonstrating his pater¬
nal interest in the welfare of his charges, especially in their lifetime
employment and care in old age; and by appropriate festivities, favours
and rewards. He catered to the foibles of his subordinates and sought
to turn them to account. He could turn to expulsion as a last resort, but
his success lay in winning positive loyal service.

This system of labour organization has marked similarities to that
found in classical feudalism. It was, apparently, the same difficulty of
labour shortage that induced the feudal organization of labour through
serfdom in medieval Europe, in place of classical slavery based upon
###### abundant labour supplies.3 It is arguable that the organization of craft
labour in medieval Europe was similarly predicated upon labour shor¬
tage; provided a sensible way to develop appropriate quantities and
qualities of labour under conditions of scarcity; and disintegrated when
an abundance of craft workers destroyed its basic assumption.4 The
long survival of feudal traditions, by which those in low stations owed


-----

not only provides analogies for Canadian practices in earlier centuries
but probably facilitated their development. On the other hand, the an¬
alogies are admittedly limited, and the variations of practice in Canada
are almost as extensive as the variations grouped under the title of
"feudalism" in Europe. But there was a kind of labour organization that
preceded the free labour market of industrial capitalism, that was not
slavery, nor a putting-out system, nor the share system of early capi¬
talist commerce. Its distinctive characteristics will become evident in
the examples examined below.

###### New France

There are obvious feudal aspects to the organization of New France.*
Kings of France thought of the colony as a fief, bestowed paternal care
and generous material provisions for the colony's welfare, and anti¬
cipated loving obedience. Royal initiative and royal capital were the in¬
dispensable agents for the colony's development: the industries that
flourished in New France were the ones that the government made
flourish.5 The colony's agriculture rested upon a basis of feudal tenure.6
Urban industry consisted of small, independent craft establishments,
not unlike those of medieval towns. The attitudes of the colonists
were marked by an aversion for regular work and an immature appetite
for profit-seeking in a Sombartian sensef — that is, they were pre¬
capitalist attiudes, not untypical of feudal Europe.

Nevertheless, New France did not employ feudal methods with
anything like the purity and consistency that might easily be suppos¬
ed. With respect to urban industry, it appears that New France may
have had a few guilds,7 and it has been complained that the "old guild
system" was prolonged to the disadvantage of industrial develop¬
ment.8 Craft traditions probably militated against new methods of
production, in New France as in other places. But the facts seem to
support the sweeping assertion that the colony never had a guild system
at any time, and therefore, that whatever delayed development, it was
not guilds.9

The colony did, however, have a chronic condition of labour short-

age, and what is most striking about its industry is the failure of em¬
ployers, for the most part, to accept fully the limitations imposed by
this fact and to meet them by establishing suitable personal relation¬
ships. It is true that workmen's overhead costs were assumed by the
employer: unskilled labour was commonly hired for one or more years,
and skilled labour from France came on contracts, usually of three
years.10 But employers seem to have assumed usually that nothing
###### further was required of them. They knew that skilled labour was scarce, that the workmen knew they were scarce, and that both parties under¬
stood that dismissal was a remote and desperate sanction. Yet little
###### effort was made to supplement wage payments by other incentives. In¬
stead, matters were let run on until something went wrong, where¬
upon the workmen were denounced and berated for their moral de¬
ficiencies.

A reason for this behaviour was the prevailing conviction that
wages paid in Canada — about twice those in France—were outra¬
geously high. It seems to have been assumed that workmen, in return
for this generous remuneration, should perform' an uncommon quan¬
tity and quality of work, and expect no pampering.11 The view that
Canadian wage rates were immoral because they were above French
wage rates rested, of course, on a moral approach (looking from the
top downward) to the question of wage levels, rather than an econom¬
ic one. But it is a viewpoint not only common among employers in
later centuries, but one which writers on New France seem unable to
escape, so that its popularity in New France itself should not be sur¬
prising. The views of the workmen can only be inferred, but the infer¬
ence is that their first acquaintance with the colony convinced them —
perhaps also on moral grounds — that their wages were too low for
such harsh situations.12 In 1671, the carpenters recently imported to
establish a shipbuilding industry staged a strike at work — a slow¬
###### down— to win living expenses in addition to their stipulated wages.13
They did win, but the authorities were outraged. Similarly, the
workmen brought out in the 1730s to establish the St. Maurice Forges
were at first quite insubordinate.14 Labour morale and discipline im¬
proved greatly after these unpleasant initiations. Many workmen
seem to have decided that Canada was not a bad place after all, and
presumably employers gained skill in handling them. Still, a cleavage
on the question of the morality of the Canadian wage level remained
as an obstacle to the provision of effective incentives for labour.

In addition, some of the colony's employments were urban — nota¬
bly Quebec shipbuilding — whereas personal methods are best suited
to isolated work forces. Moreover, the colony's major industries were
operated by the government. A government director might, of course,


-----

Levasseur, in the Quebec shipyards, had this talent. But, in New France,
there were too many officials exclaiming over the dreadful expense;
there was frequent and unwise interference; there was manipulation
and graft. In consequence, whatever may have been feudal in the colony,
its labour force was not always given a personal organization in the
sense set out at the beginning of this chapter. Rather, New France often
tried to apply the methods of the free market without enjoying the sanc¬
tions of that market.

The Fur Trade15

The matured Montreal fur trade required, in addition to the labour of
aboriginal primary producers, two distinct types of employee: traders
and canoemen. The foundations of its labour organization, as of the
trade itself, were laid in the French period. Early development depen¬
ded upon the incentives provided by free trading. Pioneering activity
is generally better suited to profit-sharing than to a wage system, so
###### that large incentives may be offered and so that risks may be spread. In
any case. New France lacked an effective mechanism to compel a wage
system — that is, to prevent access to the trading opportunities that
constituted the means of production. In the days of spectacular ex¬
tension of the trade, near the end of the seventeenth century, there
does not seem to have been a very clear distinction between traders
and canoemen: the coureurs de bois, who operated in small parties, were,
in effect, both. But before 1760, the French had worked out nearly all
the machinery of the later trade: food depots, strategically-located
posts in the northwest and elsewhere, and the supply system de¬
pendent on two sets of canoemen who met at Grande Portage or
Michilimackinac. What was most precious in this heritage was the re¬
markable investment in skilled labour to produce a set of highly-skilled
###### traders and another set of highly-skilled canoemen.

The difficulty of developing a race of competent fur traders has
been stressed,16 and the French ones were supremely competent. Yet
###### other nations managed to produce traders of reasonable shrewdness
and tenacity; and the incentive system applied to traders and their
clerks seems to find its logic in the strategic position of the trader,
permitting him to make or break the trade, rather than in the rarity
of competent men. On the other hand, the cadre of skilled canoemen
which New France developed was, and remained, unique. Others had
either to hire them or to make do with inferior substitute methods of
###### transportation.17 The differentiation of this labour force from the
traders, and the development of the traditions that marked it, remain
obscure processes. The men seem to have been drawn largely from New
France's farm population which, for this purpose, served as the labour
reserve of the fur trade. In the French period the number involved


-----

may have been about 15 per cent of the colony's total labour force.18
Men were drawn to the trade because of its superior attraction as
against alternative opportunities. Wages appear to have been about 250
livres, with provisions, and perhaps some petty trading privileges.19
This remuneration was about the same as the annual income of skilled
###### workers in New France.20 Whether the canoeman went for a three- month summer run, or wintered in the interior (at higher pay), it could
be said that the trade provided for his annual overhead costs, while
affording him the leisure which his undisciplined nature sought.*
These advantages reconciled the men to their heavy and dangerous
work, and to their unattractive diet. The techniques of the canoe bri¬
gades probably developed between 1700 and 1750, during which period
canoes grew from three- to eight-man size, and came to travel typically
in brigades.21 At the head was the conductor (originally the trader).
Engages were placed in the canoes and paid according to their skill, an
###### arrangement that provided both a status system and a training program.
The isolation, the risks, the semi-military nature of organization, facili¬
tated dependence on the leader and development of esprit de corps. The
###### nature of the mature extended trade put a premium on paternalistic
labour techniques in every respect. Only by winning the approval of
his engages could the trader expect to have skilful, willing men at the
times and places required. It was necessary to select wisely, to pay well
and to offer effective leadership. The men, though not without alterna¬
tive means of employment, had a heavy investment in a specialized skill
and an obligation to work effectively as a means of self-preservation.

The Albany traders who descended upon Montreal after the Con¬
quest appreciated the value of the French fur-trading machine.22 But
###### their desire for quick profits and the acute competition of the early
years militated against its preservation. Canoemen's wages may have
been high enough — they started off at about the old French level, and
rose considerably (seemingly in real as well as nominal terms) by
1800.23 But deficiencies of leadership or organization, probably height¬
ened by a lack of sympathy between old and new subjects, resulted in
an extraordinary and unhealthy amount of unrest and labour turn¬
over in the last quarter of the eighteenth century.24 Nor were the
measures taken by the traders to overcome their difficulties very suit-

*It is a well recognized pattern of behaviour of pre-industrial societies that
the work effort was very intermittent. The literature on the disciplining
of the labour force in the industrialization process to enforce regular and
persistent effort has become extensive in recent years. As Sahlins notes,
the concept of regular labour is "bourgeois ethnocentrism", adopted also
by contemporary Marxism. "That sentence of 'life at hard labour' was passed
uniquely upon us." Marshall Sahlins, Stone Age Economics (New York: Aldine,

able. One was the application of (more or less illegal) force, which can
be very effective in a feudal labour situation if applied judiciously.25
But the traders seem to have depended more on requiring engages to
bear certificates from their priests, and on demanding vigorous sup¬
port from magistrates.26 These expedients confess failure. The traders
were corroding their superb labour force by their petty spirit and their
failures of leadership.27

Nevertheless, the Montreal traders prosecuted their business vigor¬
ously, and their grasp of labour and other techniques improved as they
moved towards combination with an eye to the development of the
###### northwest trade. The Northwest Company was distinctive in the gener¬
ous incentives which it offered traders in the field, and in their energetic
response. The method was a logical one for a partnership that grew
from many small firms, but it was also the effective method for dis¬
persed operations. The Company profited further, in some degree,
from the skill of French traders left by the old regime. With respect to
canoemen, the Company seems to have taken little pains to maintain
the morale of the Montreal brigades. Their position was scarcely stra¬
tegic, and the partners may have concluded that these brigades would
survive the need for them. But for the northwest brigades, the Com¬
pany developed a thoroughly paternalistic organization.

The Company's problem was the replica of one the French had faced
a century before: expansion into new territory. In the northwest
there had to be new food resources, smaller canoes, harder runs and
tougher men. The m<rn had to go to far places under difficult condi¬
tions. They could not be replaced quickly, and their zeal was important.
The solution also followed French precedent: the earlier expansion
had produced the paternalistic labour force of the trade, and the
###### Northwest Company re-emphasized its techniques. Isolated employ¬
ees may have been more at the Company's mercy than the Company
was at theirs; but it was sound economy to curtail labour turnover and
promote loyalty by offering conditions that encouraged lifetime ser¬
vice. Some attractions could be offered. Fur trade employees enjoyed a
superior status among the Indians and could keep Indian women more
or less at Company expense. There were long intervals when there
was little to do. There was a guaranted annual wage and a good pros¬
pect of lifetime employment. A fund existed to provide care for dis¬
abled men — provided, to be sure, from their own contributions. But
the Company did not depend on these inducements alone. It successfully
promoted an esprit de corps based upon personal loyalties, upon rivalries
among brigades and groups, and upon a difference in status between
eastern and western canoemen.28

It may have been the power of its non-wage incentives that per¬
mitted the Northwest Company to retrench on wages after 1804,


-----

when monopoly was re-established, without any noticeable harm to
morale.29 Neither is it apparent that truck pay harmed morale, even
though, at times, the Company could cut its wage costs nearly in half by
this device.30 In fact, truck pay is a practice with two faces. It has
seemed often to constitute a blatant form of exploitation that has pro¬
duced violent hostility among employees. But in these cases, employees
have had physical access, or expected to have access, to other suppliers
besides the company store. In remote locations, on the other hand, the
company store may be accepted gratefully by employees as a great bene¬
fit to themselves. Engages in the northwest could take satisfaction in
the knowledge that no supplier other than the Company was within
their reach. Perhaps they considered, too, that the wages as well as the
prices were high by distant standards.

The Hudson s Bay Company, though it had a different economic
situation and a different type of employee from Montreal organizations,
was no less bound by the exigencies of personal labour organization.
To an even greater degree than the Northwest Company, it operated
in remote areas from which little local labour could be hoped for. Re¬
placements of and additions to its labour force were brought across
###### the Atlantic during a short shipping season. Consequently, they were
even more awkward and expensive for the Bay Company than for its
rival. To get men in the first place, the Company was bound to hire on
a long-term basis. Once men were got, it was to the Company's advan¬
tage to keep them indefinitely and to encourage competence and spirit
among them. The Company's dependence on its men was great; but
the dependence of the men, in their isolated posts, upon the good faith
and wisdom of the Company, was still greater. For this labour prob¬
lem there was no conceivable solution except a paternalistic one, be¬
ginning with the Company's underwriting of labour's overhead costs.
The only question is, how effectively the Company used paternalistic
techniques in building its labour force.

Opinion on this question has varied. Innis, in his The Fur Trade in
Canada, drew contrasts between both the economic positions and the
methods of organizing labour of the Bay and Montreal companies. In
position, the advantage lay with the chartered company, for its near¬
ness to the sources of fur supply allowed it, for a long time, to avoid
###### the trouble of penetrating the continent, without its suffering disas¬ trous losses in consequence. Offsetting this, however, was the advan¬
tage possessed by Montreal of a more lively and aggressive work
force. The different calibres of labour reflected different systems of
motivation and, ultimately, the different economic positions. Precisely
because its competition was coast-bound and passive, the Hudson's
Bay Company conceived that it had no need for zeal, and it retained
a wage system which provided the slightest of monetary rewards for


-----

effort. The result was an apathetic and dissatisfied work force.31 When
the Company entered the inland trade, it turned to a system of incen¬
tives based on profit-sharing, with some other rewards for good ser¬
vice.32 Considering that the Company did practise some measure of
paternalism, that men were engaged for long terms and spent their lives
in the Company's service, the pay system adopted after 1810 would
appear to have rounded out a strong system of personal labour organi¬
zation. Nevertheless, the impression is left that the Company showed
little capacity to provide or develop positive leadership and relied far
too heavily on negative sanctions unsuited to its situation; hence, it
could not match the flair and tone of the Montreal brigades, and won
its victories in spite of its disspirited work force, not because of it.

Dr. Glover also contrasts the Bay and Montreal companies, but
with sharp revisions on both sides.33 He finds that the Montreal tra¬
ders were pretty unsatisfactory employers, not only from a humani¬
tarian viewpoint but also in terms of their own self-interest. Glover
considers that the Hudson's Bay organization, on the other hand, was
a good one: good both in the quality of its leadership and the morale
of its men. He thus directs attention to the merits of that particular
military type of personal labour organization upon which the Bay
Company depended. Rigid class and military differentiation has not
very well suited either the Canadian environment or the Canadian
temperament, and Canadian writers may have judged them too harshly.
Given a class of recruits to whom a military structure was not inher¬
ently distasteful, and officers of some capacity, a military system rely¬
ing on negative and non-monetary sanctions for its discipline might
still achieve a reasonable level of morale and effectiveness. It may be,
on the other hand, that Glover gives the Hudson's Bay system too
much credit. It cannot be without significance that it was found useful
to add monetary incentives to the system, or that these were highly in¬
consistent with the previous system; and it is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that the Company had a muscle-bound organization.

What may have hardened views against the Company, and brings
out clearly some of the essentials of personal labour relationships, was
the Company's record after the merger of 1821. Governor George
Simpson, of the combined companies, set out to apply the dicta of capi¬
talism to employees and Indians alike.34 A redundant labour force, the
fruit of monopoly, seemed to make this a possible policy in dealing
with labour. Labour reserves were settled at Red River, from which
settlement men could be hired for short periods. Various other
sources of labour for transport were explored on a temporary and par¬
simonious basis. If there had been a true labour surplus, barred from a
livelihood except by sufferance of the Company, Simpson's capitalistic
labour policy might have been permanently successful. However, the


-----

bars against alternative means of livelihood were not tight enough:
###### the advantages to employers of a capitalistic market were sought be¬
fore the market really existed. What Simpson actually did was to pro¬
duce profits out of the unrecognized corrosion of the magnificant
labour force bequeathed him by the Montreal company. When the
demoralization of that labour force had become complete, about 1850,
###### the Company could no longer command labour at the times and places
desired and had to content itself with a very inferior quality of em¬
ployee.35

###### Calvin & Company

The timber and lumber trades generally do not afford instances of
highly-developed paternalistic labour organization. However, one firm
engaged in producing and shipping timber appears, from its perceptive
biography,36 to have been a striking exception. This is the firm of Calvin,
Cook & Company, founded by D.D. Calvin, with its successor and sub¬
sidiary companies.

It is significant that the Calvin firm was not just another competing
timber firm. It specialized in the production of hardwood instead of the
usual softwood, in exploiting the St. Lawrence rather than the Ottawa
watershed, and especially in forwarding timber down the St. Lawrence.
It was also unlike other firms in its possession of a permanent, con¬
venient, yet isolated base in Garden Island, near Kingston, and in the
breadth of its activities, which included shipbuilding. In short, the firm
###### sought positions of monopoly from which it stretched out to conduct
related activities that served to reinforce the monopoly. To be success¬
ful, such an enterprise required unusual quantities and qualities of
labour in unusual places. If it did not require exceptional loyalty from
its employees, it certainly fared better for having it. To obtain these
advantages, the Calvins developed a personal organization of their
labour force, which appears to have numbered 600 to 700 men.

The key employees of the firm were those highly skilled in raft
construction, raft pilotage and shipbuilding. All of them were housed
at Garden Island. To these retainers and their families:

###### "the Governor" and his son felt a responsibility similar to that
which they felt for their customers. "You can always depend on
us" might equally well have been said to employee as to customer.
When the timber market broke in the panic of 1873, timber¬
making was of course curtailed, but "the Governor" had no
###### thought of "shutting down altogether" as so many firms and em¬
ployers did in that grim time... (The employees were told) we
must all carry a little piece of (the load) — the firm will lose money


-----

going but we'll fight it out altogether... The building of the
ocean-going barque Garden Island was the peak of "the Gover¬
nor's" effort (and sacrifice) to keep the men employed... and a
very costly effort it was ... 37

This organization did not depend upon generous wages or short
hours of work, but rather expected its other advantages to substitute
for them.38 Esprit de corps built up by security and paternalism in the
communal society of Garden Island39 was evidently an effective incen¬
tive, as demonstrated in the faithful service to the firm of three gener¬
ations of sail-makers.40 For certain superior classes of employees to
which these devices could hardly be applied, such as wood bosses and
ship captains, reliance was put upon the incentive of profit-sharing.41
There was even a paternal aspect to the firm's relations with its tem¬
porary employees, especially Indian raftsmen, although these men
were notoriously undependable and exasperating.42

The Calvin organization survived a good deal of technological
change, but it is significant that the change enhanced the productivity
of existing skilled trades for the most part, rather than promoting a
substitution of unskilled labour.43 Integration facilitated the shifting
and economic application of the fixed labour force with lifetime tenure
###### that was the product of the firm's labour policy, and spread the burden
and risk of the overhead costs of the workmen. The eventual decline
of the firm was inevitable in view of the obsolescence of the economic
activities in which it engaged. But it seems doubtful whether the Cal¬
vin organization could, in any case, have survived the development in
Canada of a capitalist labour market, with the consequent power of
###### other employers to hire on a temporary basis and avoid the overhead
costs of their labour.

The St. Maurice Forges

Production of iron at the St. Maurice Forges, near Three Rivers,
began tentatively in 1732, and seriously in 1738. It continued until
1883. The Forges, then, operated for one hundred and fifty years — a
record matched by few North American enterprises. These years
spanned the French regime, the English regime and Confederation; the
ancient economy of the eighteenth century and the modern one of the
nineteenth. In their day, the Forges were almost the only large indus¬
trial plant in Canada, their scale sharply out of proportion to that of
###### other enterprises. Their products dominated the Canadian market for
iron goods for a century. For about the same period, the Forges seem
to have been the most advanced ironworks in America, and they were
favourably compared with European works. Yet they have not attracted
much attention, and some general history of this enterprise is given


-----

here to provide a perspective for discussion of its labour force.44

###### There had been explorations for iron and talk of ironworks in New
France for about seventy years before 1730, mostly with the thought
###### that local iron production would guard against the uncertainties of
ocean communications in wartime. However, the St. Maurice Forges
had the rare distinction in New France that they were not initiated by
###### government action. Entrepreneurship came from the family of mer¬
chant-seigneurs that held St. Maurice seigneurie, which had slight pros¬
pects for farming, but a wealth of minerals. The timing was good: in
1729, New France was beginning its period of greatest prosperity.
Francois Poulin, who promoted the project, possessed a capital of 30,000
livres not much, but more than most colonists had. The authorities
readily granted a twenty-year monopoly of iron mining and manufac¬
###### ture in the Three Rivers area, with right to mine not only in St. Maurice
but in neighbouring seigneuries.

In terms of the techniques of iron production used before the nine¬
###### teenth century, St. Maurice was probably the best location in Canada.
Within ten miles of the proposed iron works there was so much bog
iron ore — rich, easily worked and at the surface of the ground — that
the Forges scarcely ever found it necessary to look further. There
were, however, other deposits in the neighbourhood which eventual¬
ly supported other ironworks. The region was also rich in forests for
charcoal-making. Limestone for flux was conveniently at hand. The
###### stream selected to provide waterpower proved to be very satisfactory
for that purpose. The Forges had access to Three Rivers (about seven
miles distant) by road and by the St. Maurice river. Three Rivers was
well placed for the distribution of finished goods to the Canadian
market.

The original plan was a simple one. A couple of workmen (miners)
were imported from France in 1731, but chief dependence was put upon
a local blacksmith who was sent off in 1732 to study the operation of
contemporary New England forges. These were primitive affairs, which
made an indifferent job of refining a small output of iron. But they had
the immense advantage of economizing both on capital and labour.45
Their plan seemed to fit the needs of a cautious small capitalist, like
Poulin. Under the blacksmith's direction, a New England-style forge
was built and some iron, apparently good in quality, was turned out.
But operations were pursued only for a few months, the method used
being judged unsatisfactory and unprofitable. From the economic
viewpoint, it seems unfortunate that the simple, inexpensive system
of operation was not given a thorough trial.

However, the syndicate that had been formed to operate the Forges
in 1733, and then reorganized after Poulin's death in that year, sus¬
pended operations until skilled advice and aid could come from France


-----

A French ironmaster (Vezain) arrived in 1735, and, indeed, a second
one (Simonnet) in 1736. Vezain proposed a big blast furnace with two
forges, the requisite dams for waterpower, and supplementary build¬
ings. A hundred men worked from mid-1736 to the fall of 1737 to
complete the establishment, which included an elaborate chateau
intended for living quarters and offices. The cost was over 200,000
livres, as against Vezain's estimate of 36,000 livres. The company had
received a government loan of 100,000 livres, but required additional
support; it owed nearly 200,000 livres by 1738.46 Strenuous efforts
had been made to recruit skilled labour from France, and about sixty
men were on hand in 1738, most of them arrivals of that summer.47

Some reconstruction proved necessary to correct faults in the
works, and an additional forge was added in 1739 because — ridicu¬
lous though the fact may appear in the light of the earlier shortage of
labour — the large force of skilled workers assembled could not be
fully employed by the existing equipment. But, though substantially
rebuilt on two or three later occasions, the Forges of 1736 remained
unaltered to 1883. The high furnace refined by use of a cold air blast, a
method evidently suited to the local ore. In general, methods were the
best in use in France, and French methods had been much advanced in
the half-century before 1740 by copying Swedish examples, following
pilgrimages of French ironmasters to Sweden promoted by Colbert.48
The iron produced was usually declared better than American or
English, and sometimes was held to be as good as Swedish.49

The capacity of the Forges was supposed to be 300 tons of iron per
year, but what they proved able to produce (after 1739) was 200
tons.50 The difference may be accounted for by the fact that winter
operation proved difficult, and the custom was established, and ever
after observed, of closing down the furnace for about five months
each year. From May to December, the furnace operated 24 hours
each day, with two sets of workmen taking alternative six-hour shifts.
At first, the Forges produced only forged iron. However, moulding
was added in 1741, evidently with the aid of additional skilled work¬
men imported in 1740. Pots and pans were produced from 1741, and
stoves and bullets from 1744.51 In 1747, the Forges were equipped to
produce round bar iron, and the casting of cannon and production of
steel were attempted the same year, though without enough success
to encourage much further effort.52 Cast iron products seem to have
made up 5 to 10 per cent of the firm's output, by weight, during the
French regime.53 Forged iron output exceeded the colony's needs, and
perhaps half was exported to France, for use in French naval ship¬
yards, at somewhat inflated prices.54 On the other hand, the Forges
suffered when French ironworks dumped their products in Canada in
1748.55


-----

The syndicate that had built the Forges did not survive long. The
great expense of the works caused difficulty, but the real trouble was
the bankruptcy of Frangois Etienne Cugnet, the chief partner, occas¬
ioned by losses on his far-flung operations of which the Forges was
only a part. No other private operator was found for the works during
the French regime.56 To save the royal investment and to maintain a
military resource, government operation was undertaken from 1742.
The ironworks did not make good returns under royal control, but
their record is not so bad as some comments imply. Up to 1757, total
profits were about 130,000 livres      - two-thirds of the original7 royal
investment.57 However, profits were inflated by artificial pricing.
What contemporary observers stressed was not the nominal profit
record but the bad management that prevented appearance of very
substantial profits, which they thought the Forges could produce.58
The marked profitability of the works after 1767 suggests that this
criticism was just. The beneficiaries of the Forges during the French
period were officials at the Forges and at Quebec who prospered on
the plant s indifferent balance sheet. The very effort to overcome this
difficulty, by dividing authority among officials who reported sepa¬
rately on their trusteeships, prevented efficient managers, if there ever
were any, from tightening up the Forges' organization.59 A good deal
of weight should be given also, and was given by contemporary minis¬
ters, to the pioneer aspect of the venture. It was inevitable that there
should be expensive mistakes in exploring the potentialities of the
ironworks. Finally, the numerous wars of the period had a depressing
effect. Generally, there is little evidence to support the proposition
that the St. Maurice Forges was a marginal and premature enterprise,
at a comparative disadvantage to farming and the fur trade.60

The Forges fared badly during the Seven Years' War. Its labour
force was partially dispersed, and its equipment was all but useless by
1760. British military authorities had the Forges worked on a small
scale in 1761 and 1762. They passed formally to the British crown in
1763, but stood idle for several years. Then, in 1767, a syndicate of
Quebec merchants leased the property from the government for
sixteen years at an annual rental of £25 currency, but with the impor¬
tant provision that £4,500 was to be invested to repair the dilapidated
works. The leading figure in the syndicate was Christophe Pelissier,
though most of the partners were old subjects. Reconstruction was
vigorous and effective, and a sawmill (and perhaps a gristmill) was
added to the establishment.61 Three skilled Welsh ironworkers and
perhaps some other British experts were added to the labour force. It
is hard to be sure of the company's success,62 but it would seem that
profits were high after the first years of reconstruction. Gross sales in


-----

third of this as profit.63 The sales figures are reasonable, and the profit
not unlikely.

Discussion of this Forges' regime has centred on the sympathy of the
ironworks' directors for the American Revolution. In 1775 and 1776,
Pelissier not only supplied the American armies in Canada with iron
products and munitions, but showed decided sympathy by his perso¬
nal behaviour. When the American forces retired from Canada in 1776,
Pelissier thought it best to leave also, with the cash assets of the
Forges. Laterriere, his assistant, had been imprisoned in 1776 as an
American sympathizer, but was released after a month. When Pelis¬
sier fled, Laterriere appropriated both the direction of the Forges and
Mme Pelissier. The rivalry thus implied with Pelissier may have pro¬
tected him from arrest.64 Eventually, in 1779, Laterriere too was
imprisoned for his obvious encouragement of a second American in¬
vasion. These events have led one author to discuss the mildness of
Flaldimand's* rule,65 another to seek an explanation of peculiar be¬
haviour in the personalities of the men involved.66 There is an additional
aspect of these episodes that deserves attention.

Canadians, in 1775, were decidedly sympathetic to the American
Revolution67 despite a good deal of subsequent writing designed to
create a contrary impression, and the Forges' directors might very
well have shared this sentiment. Moreover, industrialists do not ordi¬
narily oppose conquering armies, least of all when they offer liberal
contracts. In addition, those whose fortunes depended on a colonial
manufacture had unusual reason to desire independence. The Forges
catered to the local market and would benefit from its growth, where¬
as mercantile doctrine envisioned the colony as an attenuated supplier
of raw materials. The Forges had much to fear from British hostility to
colonial manufactures expressed through political restrictions and
###### through unrestricted economic competition. It has been argued that
Canada's fur traders wished to preserve the imperial connection be¬
cause of their business interest in it.68 The same ground of economic
interest furnished the Forges' directors with reasons for revolution.

The term of the Pelissier company was completed with another part¬
ner, Dumas, directing the Forges. In 1783, a new lease for sixteen
years, still at £25 per year, was given to Conrad Gugy. Since the iron¬
works was now a profitable concern, this lease can only be regarded as
a novel method of rewarding an old soldier. In 1787, the lease was
taken over by the Quebec firm of A. Davidson and Lee, at a valuation

*Sir Frederick Haldimand was governor of the Trois Rivieres district from
1762 to 1765, including the St. Maurice Forges. After a posting in the American
colonies and a British military command in the revolutionary war, he returned
to Canada as Governor-in-Chief from 1778 to 1786 Ed


-----

of £2,300, apparently in settlement of Gugy's debts.69 In 1793, the
small remainder of the lease passed for £1,500 to the more or less
related firm of G. Davidson, Munro, and Bell, which became Munro
and Bell in 1794. Thus dawned the Bell regime at St. Maurice.

###### Matthew Bell came to Canada from Scotland as a youth. He was
only twenty years old when he joined the firm of Davidson and Lee
(and perhaps acquired an interest in the Forges) and about twenty-
nine when he took direct charge of the works in 1798.70 Bell remained
as manager, and a sort of feudal sovereign besides, until 1845, when
his age was seventy-six or seventy-seven. He was long in partnership
with David Munro and may have had other effective connections, but
he was the key man throughout. His was the longest and most remark¬
able tenure of the Forges.

From 1800 till 1806, Bell leased the Forges from the government at
£850 per year, with the additional commitment to spend £1,500 on
improvements.71 That the rent was so far above the amounts paid
before was party due to-the fact that other interests, associated with
the Batiscan Forges, offered competitive bids for St. Maurice. Even so.
Bell received special consideration on the ground of his heavy invest¬
###### ments and his efficient management.^ Profits could hardly have been
less than £1,500 per year, and may have been higher.78 The Forges was
in a strong position. It had been remodelled so that two-thirds of the
###### output consisted of the more remunerative cast products.74 Bell had undertaken from the start to meet English prices,76 the quality of his
products was said to be superior to that of English imports,76 and sales
agencies were maintained in the principal centres of the colony.77 The
firm catered also to new demands: iron for the Quebec shipbuilding
industry, potash kettles, and machinery for early steam boats.78 The
Canadian market for iron was expanding and prices were rising: Selkirk
###### put sales in 1804 at £10,000 to £12,000, though they had "formerly"
been only £7,000.79

In view of the investments required of Forges' grantees, a long lease
for twenty-one years was offered in 1806 by public auction. But only
###### Munro and Bell bid, to receive the lease at the ridiculous rental of £60
per year. The collusion necessary for this result appears to have de¬
pended on political considerations. Bell's pocket borough of Three
Rivers seems to have had special value in 1806 to Thomas Dunn, a
principal partner in the rival Batiscan ironworks.80 This iniquitous
###### arrangement caught the eye of the Colonial Office, and Bell was re¬
quired to raise his rental to £500 per year in 1810. However, his lease
was extended to 1831. Various extensions and renewals carried Bell
###### through to 1845, all at £500 per year, though sometimes additional
woodland was included in the lease. This effective monopoly could be

prosper was a benefit to the country. The argument was made, and the
disintegration of the Forges after 1845 indicates its soundness. But Bell
did not depend on this theoretical support. He offered lavish entertain¬
ment to Governors and others in positions of power. This "expense of
doing business" is alleged to have taken the largest share of Bell's
generous profits, though it is difficult to believe that the director did
not enjoy this obligation.81 These circumstances demonstrate the di¬
verse demands that might be put upon entrepreneurship in the early
###### nineteenth century. However, the prosperity of the Forges offered
compensation for Bell's efforts.

###### Output was valued at £24,000 to £30,000 per year in the early
1830s, about half of this being accounted for by stoves. The estab¬
lishment was valued at £12,500 in 1833, while its inventory of ma¬
terials, supplies and finished goods was put at no less than £48,000.82

In 1830, Bell had long ago overcome the competition of other
ironworks. He successfully maintained his favoured position in gov¬
###### ernment circles. He was celebrated for the "certain and uniform
employment" which he offered.83 But he lacked an effective defence
against a new threat, the rise of popular and nationalist agitation in
French Canada. From the 1830s to the 1850s orators in Lower Canada,
and particularly the deputies from Three Rivers, found an inexhaustible
store of ammunition in attack on the Forges' monopoly. The agitation
constituted, as one writer has said, an anti-trust movement.84 It was
spiced by Bell's connections with unpopular government and by the
fact that the workmen at St. Maurice were French, whereas the mas¬
ters and foremen were English, though it may be doubted that there
was any support for this agitation from the workmen at the Forges.
The ostensible ground of attack was that the extensive woodlands
held by the Forges blocked agricultural settlement up the St. Maurice.85
The period was marked by agricultural over-population in French
Canada, and by a search for new land to colonize, but the Forges land
was not an answer to this problem. A considerable amount of it was
offered for settlement in 1843, but there were no takers.86 A few
years later, when the Forges was entirely stripped of land, settlers
still did not come, and Suite wrote, "Even now the Forges land is al¬
most without inhabitants."87 As Bell had insisted, these lands were
badly suited to agriculture.

Several writers have taken the colonization argument seriously; yet
the main and different grounds of attack on the Forges were made
clear at public inquiries.88 The complainants were not intended set¬
tlers but the merchants of Three Rivers. They did not argue that lack of
settlement harmed landless habitants but that it hampered the devel¬
opment of Three Rivers.89 A special grievance was that the Forges'
people did not spend their wages in Three Rivers but, as always, at


-----

their local (company) store.9° Nor was iron sold at Three Rivers, any
more than at other places. The merchants wanted ironworkers to re¬
side and spend money in Three Rivers, and implied that an iron staple
should be located there, to which buyers would have to resort.

To the aristocratic paternalism of the Forges was opposed the logic
of the capitalist market, as understood by local lower-middle-class
representatives. They proposed to lease ore lands to many people, and
###### thus to encourage competition. Competition in producing ore for the
Forges was workable and eventually existed so far as collusion among
###### the habitants allowed.91 But competition among ironworks also was
envisioned: with a magnificent dismissal of the distinction between
an ironworks and a blacksmith's shop, it was even pointed out that
several forges already existed in Three Rivers.92 That this argument
rested on a monstrous misapplication of the new economic ideas of the
competitive market may have been appreciated by those who used it.
What is significant is the use of these new ideas by the pushing middle
class to enforce and rationalize their grip upon the state. The mer¬
chants expressly disclaimed any responsibility for the welfare or future
of the Forges' employees.93 Their resort to the mores of the capitalist
labour market implied that such a labour market was appearing.

By 1845, Bell was at last ready to yield up the Forges. No secret was
made of the fact that the plant had been allowed to run down very
badly in anticipation of a change in tenure. Forges and lands were sold
(separately) to the highest bidder, Henry Stuart, for £11,475. The
importance of management was now illustrated. Stuart undertook an
ambitious program of renovation, but he evidently made costly mis¬
takes, and his efforts to operate were not very successful. Within two
years, the Forges passed to the Ferrier family of Montreal. These
were hard, economical managers who are supposed to have made large
profits.94 In 1851, the Ferriers sold the Forges (without land) to Andrew
###### Stuart and John Porter, of Montreal. These owners paid little attention
to the works, allowed them to deteriorate, and were dispossessed in
1861 when the Canadian government foreclosed the mortgage held
against them.95 The works were again sold and eventually passed in
1863 to John MacDougall & Sons of Three Rivers.96 The MacDougalls
were energetic ironmasters and made profits while the Forges experi¬
enced a last blaze of glory. Finally, in 1883, the Forges were closed for¬
ever, because of the increasing difficulty of competing with more
modern ironworks in an era of low prices.

Long before 1883, the St. Maurice Forges was an anachronism, its
equipment outmoded by technical advances, its paternalistic labour
organization by the growth of a free labour market. But its early tech¬
nical superiority, the good management it frequently enjoyed, and


-----

turn that permitted its survival almost to the twentieth century.

The St. Maurice Workmen

The heart of St. Maurice was its furnace, forges and foundry. Thirty
to forty men were required to operate these. Some of them were la¬
bourers, but a dozen or more were key craftsmen, without whom the
plant could not operate. Other permanent employees included book¬
keepers, carpenters, boatmen, prospectors for ore, sawmill employees
and a large force of carters, making a total of about 120. Finally, there
were three or four hundred temporary employees, hired in season
each year to cut wood, make charcoal, dig and haul ore and make roads.
These were drawn predominantly from among the habitants of the
Three Rivers area. The structure of this work force and its total of 400
to 500 workers persisted through the whole life of the Forges, though
there were temporary fluctuations. As many as 800 were employed
when production was pushed in the 1770s,97 and perhaps at some other
times.

The permanent employees lived at the Forges with their families,
making a village of 400 to 500 persons. The site was described as
pleasant and healthful. From the beginning, the firm provided the
housing for its workmen. The great chateau had been intended to
house employees, though it never accommodated a large part of them.
There were also many cottages, scattered haphazardly with their gar¬
dens, usually described as clean and comfortable.98 In the early nine¬
###### teenth century, there were fifty-five of these cottages.99 In addition,
there appears to have been a good deal of accommodation of a tempor¬
ary bunkhouse nature, which may have been used for temporary em¬
ployees. Physically, as socially, the village was a world apart.

The villagers of St. Maurice developed a solid, complacent and in¬
troverted community, but not without strenuous conflicts to begin
with. The seventy-five skilled workmen imported from France be¬
tween 1736 and 1740 — mostly in 1738 — came without enthusiasm,
despite the high wages that drew them. Matters were made worse by
unskilful management and by the fact that the works were not ready
to employ the men fully for some time. The workmen were "not
amenable to discipline for they knew that they could not easily be re¬
placed"; they "exacted exorbitant wages and dawdled over their work";
some were "unreliable, insubordinate and quarrelsome".100 A major
issue in the first years was the truck system. There was then a com¬
pany store at St. Maurice, as there was ever after. The remoteness of
the village would seem to justify this. But the workmen believed in '
the early days, no doubt correctly, that their wages were sharply dis¬
counted through store pay; and, on the other hand, they bought too
much brandy. Efforts to restrict abuses from 1739 by providing for


-----

cash wages on demand, and by measures to curtail the consumption of
brandy, may have had some success.101 At any rate, there is nothing to
indicate discontent with store pay in later years. The workmen were
incensed also by delay in paying wages due about 1741, and by the
failure of wages to advance with prices during the war-bred inflation
of 1744.102 Probably a greater cause of discontent still was the un¬
stable and ineffectual management, and the inability of the work¬
men to produce the quantity and quality of output expected of them.
Colonial authorities tried to solve the Forges7 labour problems by
applying legal authority and force. In 1745, after a visit to St. Maurice,
Hocquart issued

an ordinance limiting strictly the amount of liquor sold to the
workmen and forbidding any man to absent himself from the
Forges without permission on pain of losing his wages the first
time and the additional penalty of corporal punishment for any
###### other offence. The directors were enjoined to punish "scandals
and public debauches" and to proclaim the ordinance every three
months by way of a reminder.103

Repression often worsens labour conflicts, but it may have improved
discipline in this instance, especially if other sources of dispute were
overcome about the same time. Another control device used was the
location of a priest at the Forges.104

Even in the 1740s, however, the work force became coherent,
moderately efficient and reasonably satisfied. Management seems to
have improved. Then, as contracts expired, men did not often return
to France, despite talk of this recourse; but they did take the opportu¬
nity to negotiate terms — called "exorbitant" by the authorities — that
suited them much better. But the main device to hold workmen and
modify their opinions of Canada — Canadas secret labour weapon —
seems to have escaped notice, though it is implicit in the genealogy
###### with which Suite adorned his work on the Forges. Workmen had
scarcely arrived at Three Rivers when they began marrying Cana-
diennes. Soon they were baptizing children — the next generation of
ironworkers. Suite's parish records also reveal the development of
blood relationships among the Forges families, and of a local caste sys¬
tem. The most highly skilled workers tended to be interrelated, and
conversely, an outsider who married into this group was likely to be
worked into a responsible position.105 It seems reasonable to suppose
###### that family and community ties soon played a vital part in keeping
workers at St. Maurice.

The Forges group had distinctive social traits which their isolation
preserved to the end. Unlike most settlers in New France, they came


-----

neighbourhood of Dijon.106 They preserved the pride of craftsman¬
ship associated with the master craftsmen of medieval Europe.107
They had peculiar customs and dress and an unusual wealth of super¬
stition.108 Suite said they were notorious for swearing, quarreling and
bad manners; but notable for cleanliness and very moral (meaning
###### that illegitimate births were rare).109 In keeping with their other char¬
acteristics, the ironworkers were sticklers for tradition. The opera¬
tion of the blast furnace had always been directed by the ringing of a
bell. Late in the nineteenth century, MacDougall proposed to substi¬
###### tute clocks and speaking tubes, but the workmen would have none of
this: "On ne change pas de religion, voyez-vous; ce qui etait bon pour
nos peres est bon pour nous .. ."110

Peculiarity was fortified by the paternalism that became the tradi¬
tion of the Forges. Early difficulties emphasized the dependence of
management upon the key workers, but the workers were hardly less
dependent on management, for other employment suited to their
skills was not to be found easily. The more successful operators, at
least, were solicitous for the welfare of their employees. They had the
advantage that they could offer lifetime employment. Dating proba¬
bly from Hocquart's intervention, the Forges' director was a social and
moral arbiter of the community .as well as an employer. In the 1770s,
and perhaps long after, workers were not to entertain outsiders or
keep them in their homes without permission. There was much gaiety
and entertainment at the Forges in the winter, but this came under
the director's control.111

The feudal pattern was sustained by the fact that succeeding genera¬
tions of workers grew up at the Forges. In 1852, St. Maurice was des¬
cribed as made up of "several hundred families", all born at the village,
and of "more than a thousand persons accustomed from their childhood
to a particular branch of labor" and contented with their lot.112 Many
were descendants of the earliest workmen there. A few British iron¬
workers were introduced during the last decades of the eighteenth
century to overcome the pronounced shortage of key workmen of the
1760s. But these never numbered more than a dozen, they were ab¬
sorbed by marriage and familiarity into the French Catholic community,
and they fitted readily into a high niche in the hierarchical structure.113
Workmen for the other end of the hierarchy, for the jobs outside the
forges themselves, had been drawn to a large extent from local French-
Canadians, and these men sometimes advanced to key positions. But
they, too, absorbed the social and cultural traditions of the French
ironworkers.

Methods of work and pay tended to isolate the group and to
###### strengthen its feudal structure. The furnace operated continuously,
and furnace and forge men were divided into two shifts which worked


-----

###### alternate six-hour periods. However, moulders, as well as the other
employees, worked the usual hours of dawn till dusk.114 Housing and
fuel were supplied to workmen throughout. Other supplies had to
be bought, but were obtained ordinarily at the company store. Fixed
annual salaries were paid at first, but eventually nearly all wages were
paid by piece rates.ns Most of the workers were said to have been paid
400 livres per year in 1754.116 In 1796, the men were reported to re¬
ceive 34 of a piastre per day, which might amount to 800 livres per
year.117 Lord Selkirk reported in 1804 that the forgemen made £50
per year (1,000 livres) by piece rates, and the moulders received £40
(800 livres) in the same way.118 Even allowing a good deal for free
housing and fuel, and five months of winter leisure, these wages do
###### not appear to be remarkable.119 It seems probable that the immobility
of the St. Maurice labour force after the first few years, the stickiness
of wages in periods of rising prices, and the influence of profit-
motivated directors, combined to keep wage rates at modest levels. An
object of paternalistic management is to keep down wages, without
reaping lowered morale in consequence, by substituting non-econo-
mic rewards. The communal life of the Forges probably was attractive
to most workmen. Especially so must have been the long winter of fes¬
tivities, in an age that did not find the sole end of existence in work.
The heavy overhead costs of the Forges, untypical of industrial enter¬
prises of their age, enforced steady operation. This provided a regular¬
ity of employment that offset whatever deficiencies daily pay rates
were thought to have, and invited paternalistic mechanisms intended
to minimize labour mobility.

Sharply distinguished from the permanent employees at St. Mau¬
rice were the three hundred men, more or less, hired temporarily each
year. In the French period, especially around 1750, there was difficulty
in getting enough of them. Conscription of local habitants by force,
sometimes resorted to, met hostility and threats to move from the
district. Companies of the Troupes de la Marine were stationed at
###### Three Rivers in the hope that the soldiers would be willing to work at the Forges, but these men were not much used because they deman¬
ded "exorbitant" wages.12(1 It is plain that the Forges' directors were
unwilling to pay wages appropriate to their labour market and relied,
with limited success, upon force to obtain labour on their own terms.
However, these events also illustrate the hazard of seeking temporary
labour from a market without a surplus, or insufficiently stocked to be
a free labour market. The British military government of 1760 also
relied upon authority to operate the Forges. In 1762, militia units were
peremptorily ordered out to cut wood for the ironworks.121 The pri¬
vate operators who followed had no power to enlist workmen in this
summary fashion but there is no evidence that any of them suffered


-----

on that account. Presumably, they offered wages sufficient to attract
labour, which was anyhow in more generous supply. The seasonal
employees necessarily came into some contact with the St. Maurice
community, but the two groups do not seem to have affected each
###### other very much. The relation of the temporary employees to their
employer was largely confined to the "cash nexus" of the free labour
market.

The early difficulties of the Forges in assembling sufficient tempor¬
ary employees demonstrates the importance of measures taken to
retain the far more valuable skilled workers. These measures met the
social wants of the workmen well, and the economic wants acceptably.
They militated against movement and against any agency that would
induce movement. Once established, therefore, the paternalistic organ¬
ization of the work force tended to be self-preserving. The system
was not devoid of flexibility, for while it lacked the power to vary the
numbers of the work force (downwards), there was some power to
vary economic rewards so long as social advantages were preserved.
The system also contained effective incentives in the esprit de corps of
the labour force and of its status groups, and in the paternalistic acti¬
vities of the employer. Since new workers were generally the children
of old workers, they fitted in without disturbing the Forges' folkways.
The system was decidedly advantageous to the employer economically
(and possibly in other ways) in the first century of the Forges' opera¬
tion. Indeed, only the effectiveness of this labour system would seem
to offer a satisfactory explanation for the long survival of the Forges
in the face of new methods of ironworking. On the other hand, drastic
technical changes probably were impossible within this framework.
Even apart from the question of technological advance, it seems
doubtful whether an employer assuming the overhead costs of his
labour force could survive indefinitely the competition freed from this
obligation by the filling up of a free labour market.

Marmora

There were several ironworks besides St. Maurice in Canada during
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The Batiscan Forges operat¬
ed from about 1794 to 1813. The physical characteristics of their site
paralleled those of St. Maurice, and the works were patterned after
the earlier ones. The proprietors were English-speaking mechants
and officials from the topmost circles. Skilled workmen for the key
positions were brought from England, but most of the workers were
French, and the English workmen were absorbed into the French
Catholic majority. Batiscan is said to have suffered heavy losses, but
information is too meagre to say why.122

The Islet Forges were established in 1856 on the left bank of the St.


-----

Maurice, and survived to 1876. Further up river, the Radnor Forges
built in 1854 constituted an extensive and ambitious venture. Its chief
difficulty was its remoteness from transportation lines, but it contin-
ued m operation on a small scale until 1908. French-Canadians built
t e Islet Forges and shared in the Radnor ones, and some at least of the
men involved probably came from St. Maurice. 123 The later ironworks
were fifty years too late, and all newcomers were handicapped by the
competition of the established St. Maurice works. Perhaps, too, there
was insufficient time and inappropriate management to develop the
type of labour organization that supported St. Maurice. A labour
problem of this sort seems to have been one factor in the failure of the
Marmora ironworks.

The establishment of Marmora was undertaken in 1820 by a wealthy
Irish immigrant, Charles Hayes. He was encouraged by the offer of a
contract to supply iron to the naval dockyard at Kingston, and by a
###### grant of 11,000 acres of provincial lands.121 Nevertheless, Hayes's venture was decidedly incautious. Marmora had iron and waterpower
and wood, but it was thirteen miles from the Trent river which pro¬
vided a long and indifferent route, but the only possible route, to
markets. Hayes cleared roads and built vigorously in 1821 and 1822,
spending £30,000 before he had finished in 1823.128 His establishment
was extremely ambitious. He had two furnaces of four tons daily capa¬
city and apparently coal-fired, a casting house, foundry ‘ buildings,
coal houses, a sawmill, a grist mill, a tannery, houses for the staff and
various other buildings.126 Iron was produced by 1822, and was satis¬
factory in quality, but the transportation problem was never solved.
Hayes was in financial difficulties by 1824, and Marmora passed in
1825 to his creditors and, in a short time, to Peter McGill.127 The plant
operated for some time in 1826, and McGill seems to have thought it
had prospects for profitable operation, but it remained closed there¬
after, nevertheless.128

Labour difficulties were not the fundamental cause of Hayes's fail¬
ure, but they did complicate his problems. To operate Marmora re¬
quired about forty-five workmen, whose wages made up the bulk of
operating expenses which exceeded £100 per week.129 Hayes appears
to have considered that drunkenness was the basis of unsatisfactory
behaviour among workmen. He took great pains to maintain the so¬
briety of his employees by preventing their access to liquor supplies —
it is the one matter on which he exhibited firmness and power of de¬
cision— and his efforts appear to have achieved success.130 In spite of
this, or because of it, labour raised serious problems. In May 1822,
work was greatly delayed by "Wicked Combinations among my work
people — whom I have no power to control".131 Later in that year, the
###### workmen were orderly, but some of them were declared to be ineffi-


-----

###### dent.132 Shortly after, Hayes was "much plagued about workmen" —
probably this time the problem was to retain them — and the work
was badly delayed again.133 These events suggest the initial difficul¬
ties at St. Maurice; they are perhaps the inevitable accompaniments of
building a labour machine from workmen unfamiliar with each other
and with their workplace. The rawness and remoteness of Marmora,
and the hostility exhibited by Indians and settlers, were further dis¬
turbing factors.134 To provide a smooth and economical labour ma¬
chine for Marmora, to make the mutual dependence of employer and
employees in their isolated position operate to the benefit of the em¬
ployer, would seem to require the development of the kind of personal
labour relationships, and the contented and immobile labour force,
###### that were found at St. Maurice. But it is doubtful whether Hayes,
accustomed to situations in which workmen were at the mercy of
their employer, conceived of his problem this way; and still more
doubtful whether he possessed the generalship to cajole his workmen
into willing dependence. In any case, the time that would have been
necessary to cement new relationships, even with brilliant leadership,
was denied him.

Military Labour

Even now, military personnel are sometimes used to perform civilian
labour; nor, indeed, can a line be drawn precisely between military and
non-military employment. But the use of men organized in military
units for labouring work was a great deal more common before 1850
###### than afterwards. The practice reflects those inadequacies of the early
labour market that inspired other forms of pre-industrial capitalist
labour organization. Military units were already organized on feudal
lines, with an hierarchical leadership and the provision of non¬
economic incentives. The frequent wars that affected Canada in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries invited a conception of perma¬
###### nent and total war, by which civilians could be regarded as soldiers
temporarily out of service, economic activity as the support of the
machinery of war, and the use of regular soldiers in its aid as consistent
with the military objectives of the state.

New France applied its total manpower resources almost indiscrimi¬
nately to military and civilian tasks. The militia — the adult males not
in permanent military units — was called out periodically to fight, and
much more regularly for the King's corvee. In this duty they worked
###### under centralized direction on roads and bridges (wanted for both
military and civilian use) and on fortifications, for a varying number of
days each year. The system resembled the statute labour of English-
speaking communities and rested, like it, upon the undeveloped state
of the labour market and of other markets. Unemployed or surplus


-----

labour was not concentrated in particular individuals, but spread more
or less generally over all the available manpower. The unrationalized
###### nature of the economy, which prevented the individual from making
economic use of all his time, prevented him also from acquiring money
with which he could conveniently pay for someone else to perform his
public duties. However, French practice differed from statute labour in
the indeterminate amount of time that might be claimed and in the cen¬
tral direction of work for predominantly military ends. Special corvees
organized to build large fortifications or to provide transport services
in support of troops emphasize the distinction.135

The conscription of civilian labour for military tasks is a fringe of the
subject. Another fringe is represented in the settlement of military
###### veterans on farms, in the expectation that they would support them¬
selves by farming but remain available for military service. Settlement
of the Richelieu Valley — an exposed frontier in 1666 — by about 400
men from the Carignan-Salieres regiment was New France’s most
successful effort of this sort.136 But members of the colony’s regular
troops, the Troupes de la Marine, were encouraged to settle, and did
so, creating a chronic reinforcement problem for the French govern¬
###### ment.137 Like the troops induced to settle by British authorities after
1783, with the same objectives, French veterans proved to be better
###### frontier guards than they were farmers.

The real test, however, consists in the use of regular forces. In New
France, these were the Troupes de la Marine, which may have number¬
ed about a thousand men at most times.138 Though not highly trained,
they were enrolled in regular military units and were paid and sup¬
ported as such. They, along with other regular units, were occasional¬
ly used for the semi-military task of building fortifications.139 But
###### what is surprising is the freedom with which they were turned to
distinctly civilian employment. As military parties, they replaced re¬
bellious carpenters in the shipyards,140 were sent out regularly to manu¬
facture tar, resin and turpentine,141 and were employed in mining
Cape Breton coal.142 Besides these specialized employments, arising in
each case from a deficiency of other workmen to perform tasks impor¬
###### tant for state policy, the Troupes were made a labour reserve serving
the general labour market. "Discipline was so slack as practically to be
non-existent, and the soldiers were free to take employment to sup¬
plement their pay."143 The men were not only permitted but encourag¬
ed to serve the civilian market: companies were moved in 1749 to
###### Three Rivers in the hope that men could be induced to take employ¬ ment at the St. Maurice Forges.144 The overhead cost of these workers
was, of course, borne by the state, and the supplementary wage paid
them was presumably less than an economic wage. Nevertheless, the
labour of these men did not prove to be very cheap, at least for officials


-----

producing tar for the shipyards, 6r for the St. Maurice Forges,145 and
it may be doubted that the provision of cheap labour was the primary
object of the authorities in making these men available. Rather, they
sought to overcome the lack of reserves in their pre-capitalist labour
market, which told particularly against sudden or short-term demands
for labour and against demands from remote locations.

During the Seven Years' War, British commanders had to accom¬
modate themselves in labour matters to the economy of the British
seaboard provinces. They were compelled to hire civilian workmen
required in support of their troops in the open market — a seller's
market — under conditions which they found extremely irksome and
at wages rates which they considered extortionate.146 They were happy
to find a different social order in Canada, and the military governors
who took control from 1760 did their best to perpetuate the con¬
genial French practices. Militia captains were again called upon to en¬
force the corvee for the maintenance of roads and bridges;147 civilians
were conscripted to build ships;148 while special calls were made upon
the militia to cut wood for the St. Maurice Forges149 and to provide
bateaumen for the movement of military stores.150 A stubborn resis¬
tance to these demands was sometimes displayed by the habitants.151
However, while the new regime was ready to conscript local men to get
the work done, it did not have the disposition which the French regime
had displayed, to make regular troops available to the civilian labour
market. Rather, soldiers were utilized for such semi-military tasks as
building forts.152 But there were at least some occasions when British
soldiers found discipline slack enough that they could take private
employment near their posts.153

The undeveloped nature and special problems of Upper Canada
after the American Revolution induced Governor Simcoe to recom¬
mend, and his superiors to approve, the establishment for that area of
a special military force, the Queen's Rangers. This unit, of around 400
men, was established about 1792 and maintained until 1802. Its three
functions were the same which the Troupes de la Marine had fulfilled
in New France: to defend the country; to provide loyal settlers having
military experience; and to build roads, bridges, barracks and forts,
clear land, and navigate vessels.154 That the Rangers should be wanted
as road builders followed naturally from the existing scarcity of labour
and from the desirability of roads in the new province, for military as
well as civilian use. Regular British troops evidently were not very satis¬
factory as road makers: those employed to open the Lake Shore Road
did so poorly that a compassionate militia officer offered to substitute
his own, more competent men.155 But the Rangers were of North
American origin and experience, and besides building the fortifications
of York, they can be credited with forming the road system that radiated


-----

from that place.156 They worked first on Dundas Street, which they
completed from Burlington Bay to the Grand River by 1794.157 They
were on Yonge Street in 1796, when they completed the road "as far
as the navigable water on the Holland River", and a work party was
###### there again in 1799. And in 1798, the Rangers worked on "that part of
the Western road lying between Burlington Bay and Woodstock".158

The Rangers made their contribution at a time when, and place
where, no substantial number of civilian workmen existed. Eastward,
however, with the advance of settlement, a civilian labour supply was
appearing. It is significant that Asa Danforth, who cut the road from
York to Kingston in 1799 and 1800, seems to have had no trouble in
getting enough civilian labour.159 Perhaps soldiers were not needed
very much for civilian tasks after 1800. All the same, large bodies of
men could not be assembled without suggesting to many that their
potential labour should be turned to account; and every augmentation
of the supply of military labour in the years that followed brought
fresh demands for road builders. This was especially true of militia
units, made up after all of civilians and assembled at the expense of the
civilian labour market. Thus, the militia "was used extensively on the
roads during the War of 1812-14, executing improvements at the
Long Sault, Gananoque and Glengarry, and around York.160 The mili¬
###### tary forces assembled in and after 1837 also made their non-military
contributions, as will be noted below.

While military forces were being used systematically for civilian
work in western Upper Canada, a reverse case, of civilians employed
by a military authority under quasi-military conditions, can be found
at Kingston. The problem here was not a scarcity of labour in general,
###### but a scarcity of skilled labour; and if British administration at the be¬
ginning of the nineteenth century had not had a feudal tone already,
the necessity to maintain a supply of artificers for the Kingston dock¬
yard might well have inspired one. As it was, the Navy's way of hand¬
ling and holding artificers was authoritarian but paternalistic. The
Navy maintained its "company town" at Point Frederick, in which there
were about 200 workmen, and an additional 170 members of their fami¬
lies, in 1816. The Navy did not hesitate to expel people from this com¬
munity or to move them within it. But it went to considerable pains to
promote the workmen's welfare and satisfaction. It provided housing,
###### permitted artificers to buy goods from the naval stores at prices below
those in Kingston, and encouraged the maintenance and expansion of
a school that served the workmen's children.161 Dockyard paternalism
also extended, in 1830, to a battle to preserve the right of artificers to
free passage over Cataraqui Bridge.162 Aside from these benefits, the
Navy's workmen long shared in the customary reward of a grant of land
upon completion of satisfactory service.163

The construction of the Rideau Canal (1826-32) introduced another
type of military labour for non-military purposes into Canada. Two
companies of Royal Sappers and Miners were raised in England speci¬
fically for this work, and arrived on the Rideau in 1827.164 The com¬
panies may have been raised on the supposition that skilled construction
labour would not otherwise be available in the remote and raw terri¬
tory of the canal, though no lack of labour seems to have been experi¬
enced in fact.165 Cheapness may also have been a consideration. If it
was, disappointment ensued, for the Sappers and Miners were not
cheap, since they had to be paid whether they worked or not, instead
of being sloughed off in slack times as civilian workmen were.166 Even
so, it was found politic to offer the Sappers and Miners land grants at
the completion of their terms to counteract the corrosion of desertion,
the curse of contemporary British military forces in America.167 In
practice, the Sappers and Miners were not used extensively in con¬
struction, but were rather employed in coordinating the work, in
guarding stores, in testing projects to estimate a price for contractors,
in emergency repair work, and above all, in intimidating the civilian
labourers employed on the canals in order to suppress unrest and
strikes and to keep down wages.168 This example for decades after¬
wards inspired programs for stationing troops on public works to
suppress strikes or other manifestations of protest from construction
workers. It probably also inspired James FitzGibbon's "Plan proposed
for making and repairing Roads in Upper Canada. Let a Regiment be
raised to be composed of (1,000 men plus officers and NCO's)." Fitz¬
Gibbon's soldiers were to be skilled men: "I contemplate employing the
privates to superintend squads of Day laborers — these Privates not
only guiding the laborers but also working at the same time with
them." FitzGibbon thought that his force could be maintained at the
same cost as the regular troops then in Upper Canada (£30,000 per
year), that it would do more good than either regular troops or civilian
labourers, and that suitable incentives, including the inevitable land
###### grants upon the completion of service, would obviate "the great loss
by desertion".169

The Rebellion of 1837 set off a new burst of military activity in
Canada, and the continued threat of raids from the United States,
###### together with the possibility of war with that country, induced the
establishment of permanent units drawn from the militia but paid for
by Britain.170 These units were not called on very often for actual
combat, and it was natural that their use for other purposes should be
considered. Adam Fergusson in 1838 advanced a plan designed to turn
the need for defence to the advantage of local employers. He preferred
###### that defence forces be raised in Great Britain and Ireland rather than


-----

service from five to seven years and would have been paid even less
###### than regular troops, with a portion of their pay forcibly withheld, but
would have been compensated by free land grants. They were, never¬
theless, to be kept free of subversive political views so as to prevent

###### that base tampering which unhappily seduces so many of our Sol¬
diers to desert their Colours..." However, Fergusson's main point
was. Should the Military Services of these Regiments not be in con¬
###### stant requisition, the men would prove a valuable addition to the
supply of labour in the Province, and tend to moderate, what is found
to be the heaviest drawback upon the Cultivation & improvement of
the Province ... (i.e., wages)."177 Such pressure from employers may
have inclined the authorities to make military labour available for civilian
uses. Moreover, though the labour market had been glutted in 1837
and 1838, there was a labour shortage in 1839.177 It may have been
considered also that employment and additional income would aid
morale. In any case, troops (mostly if not entirely negro units) were
offered to some of the road commissioners of the province in 1839 and
after. The (extra) wage demanded for these men was one shilling a day,
for privates, as against a civilian rate for labourers of two shillings and
sixpence, or better. Not unnaturally, road commissioners considered
this offer a bargain, and demand for military labour for road work ex¬
ceeded supply.174 Road work was carried on in this way at least until
1842.175

The military units of the 1840s were used also to suppress unrest
amongst the labourers on various public works. Military commanders
considered that the regular policing of public works (as distinct from
emergency attendance at riots) was a civil function improperly thrust
upon them by the parsimony of civil authorities. Nevertheless, mili¬
tary units were stationed for long periods on the main public works of
this period. The Welland Canal was given particular attention: troops
were retained there to control the canal labourers from 1842 until
1850.176 Negro troops were used for this service — apparently, the
same ones that had done road work until 1842. This employment of
negroes to suppress Irishmen was hardly calculated to soften the anti¬
###### pathy which Irish workmen typically felt for negroes, and probably
contributed towards the widespread anti-negro agitation in Canada
West of the 1840s.

From about 1840, the Canadian labour market was well-stocked
and possessed the reserves of a developed capitalist market. There
was, therefore, little reason to call upon military personnel to perform
civilian functions, except in emergencies. For the same reason, the
custom of drawing upon militiamen for various kinds of supporting
labour tended to fall into disuse. The earlier practice offers, however,


-----

Since the overhead costs of military personnel were assumed by gov¬
ernments on defence grounds, their labour became available at small
additional cost. It was particularly likely to be called upon for short¬
term tasks, and for work in remote places, which the reserve-less
labour market was especially unable to provide. In contrast to con¬
temporary arrangements in most civilian employments, discipline was
maintained in military work parties by a minimum of attractions and a
maximum of force and punitive threats. However, there was the same

esprit de corps, the same hierarchical if not paternal leadership, and the
same reliance upon non-economic incentives.

###### Paternalism and Other Forms of Personal Labour Relations

In the early nineteenth century, Canada had many more examples of
paternalistic labour organization. It also exhibited substantially dif¬
ferent types of employment. Comparisons among the various arrange¬
ments that existed serve to delineate the limits, and the essential
nature, of personal labour organization.

Paternal methods occur frequently in the wood and water em¬
ployments that loomed so large in early Canada. Among the Quebec
timber handlers, it has been asserted, "There was an odd old-world
paternalistic (not at all democratic) relationship between the cove men
and their employers. Father and son worked for the same merchant,
the merchant and his son looked after their men, down the years .. ."177
Bateaumen, when the bateau was the basis of St. Lawrence transpor¬
tation, were organized in much the same manner as the canoemen of
the fur trade. The men worked about seven months each year, so that
they enjoyed a relatively continuous and dependable kind of employ¬
ment; they should therefore have found this work attractive. Employ¬
ers, on the other side, had reason to attract and retain reliable men
because of the regular service expected and the high degree of skill
required to operate bateaux on the St. Lawrence. Bateaumen worked
in brigades with appropriate hierarchies, like canoemen, and descrip¬
tions of them suggest that they responded warmly to leadership and
readily developed an esprit de corps. They were paid by the trip, at rates
amounting to $15 to $20 per month — high wages for the period. Nor,
according to Selkirk, were these rates reduced by truck pay.178 French-
Canadian bateaumen were enlisted for the operation of an early ferry
service at Niagara. The conditions of their employment were evident¬
ly much the same as on the St. Lawrence, with additional payment for
their transport from Montreal and back each year.179 In contrast, rafts¬
men on the St. Lawrence were handled with much less delicacy. Their
employment was less regular, and their reliability may have been a less
vital matter to the employer. Their nominal wages in 1804 were $15


-----

this amount by encouraging raftsmen to take their pay in liquor.18°
Bateaumen, like the canoemen of the fur trade, were of French
origin. Most of the raftsmen on the St. Lawrence were Caughnawaga
Indians. Both these groups were cheerful and docile employees; or, as
an observer put it, "by habit (they) are taught to be decent and respect¬
ful to employers."181 It is worth recalling Selkirk's opinion of docility
among the canoemen: "The aptness of the Canadians for this em¬
ployment depends perhaps more on this circumstance than any other";
and his comment upon a related characteristic: "The Canadians re¬
quire a good deal of temper and attention in their leaders to be com¬
pletely managed."182 It seems proper to conclude that French and
Indians exhibited some child-like qualities that encouraged their
organization into paternalistic labour systems.* However, ethnic pe¬
culiarities were a subsidiary aspect of the matter and must not be
pressed too far. It was not only Calvin and other employers like him
who handled English-speaking workmen in a similar way when they
desired to retain labour under conditions of scarcity. Early shipowners
on Lake Ontario, for instance, found it expedient to retain their sea¬
men on a permanent basis, though they could employ them on the lake
for only six months of the year.183 Similarly, in early years in Upper
Canada, carpenters were retained on an annual, or, at the least, on a
full season, basis.184 At the same time many workmen, including
French ones, were employed under different conditions.

An industry that displayed an exceptional diversity of employment
conditions is agriculture. It was first developed, of course, with the
French system of agricultural settlement, which has been justly cele¬
brated as an outstanding instance of feudal organization.! French-
Canadian agriculture was feudal in its possession of seigneurs and
seigneuries, of strip farms occupied by peasants who owed annual
payments of rent and produce in return for their holdings, and of
corvees (though these, indeed, were royal rather than seigneurial).!
But the system was more than that. Munro held that it was a truer
form of feudalism than seventeenth-century Europe knew, because it
approached closer to the mutual accommodation which feudal agricul-

ture originally denoted in Europe. The seigneurs were not simply rent
collectors, but made a crucial contribution to production by assuming
heavy burdens of capital investment and leadership. In return, the
habitant worked the soil and provided annual income, as well as respect.
The system was based upon the mutual needs of its parties: the seig¬
neurs' problem was the scarcity of labour, and the habitants' problem
was the scarcity of capital. With each side dependent on the other, a
balanced and equitable system developed, in which the seigneurs gave
much, lived close to their people and were well-regarded by them.185 It
is significant that the habitant clung to his system and resisted freehold
tenure even after the old order had been abused and distorted by two
generations of English-speaking seigneurs.186

British agricultural settlement was not directed towards the crea¬
tion of a feudal system, and, in general, did not produce one. It fur¬
nished some examples of feudal-style organization, nevertheless.
Philemon Wright's settlement at Hull, established in 1800 in much
the same patriarchal way that chieftains long ago spread settlement
in Europe, was a microcosm of a self-sufficient feudal economy. Wright's
essential problem, as he freely acknowledged, was to get and hold
labour. To keep men, he had to offer continuous employment; other¬
wise, "it would have been impossible for me to obtain men in the
spring, when I most wanted them, as the distance from any settlement
was so great."187 Scarcity of labour forced Wright, therefore, to as¬
sume a continuous responsibility for the livelihood of his men. Hav¬
ing done so, he found himself with a surplus of labour in winter; and
it was a desire to recover something from this surplus that put him
in the lumber and timber business.188

There were other patriarchal settlements, like those of McNab on
the Ottawa and of Thomas Talbot on Lake Erie.189 These did not
achieve, or even aim at, the same economic coherence that Wright's
settlement had. However, in isolated settlements like Talbot's, there
was a characteristic scarcity of capital and of alternative opportunities
###### that made men dependent on a patriarch, and a scarcity of labour that
made the patriarch dependent on the men; and consequent develop¬
ment of a society built around mutual economic and social responsibili¬
ties more elaborate than those found in capitalistic society. Indeed,
each of the more affluent among early immigrants from the United
States and Great Britain was inclined to set himself up in the same
way as a local lordling; and until about 1830, the scarcity on the fron¬
tier of men on one side and of capital and alternative employers on the
other, crowned many of these ventures with some little success.190

In spite of these flirtations with patriarchy, it was perfectly appar¬
ent before 1830 that the agricultural organization of English-speaking


-----

sized farms operated by independent farmers. The ease with which
land could be acquired, the ambition of most men to own a farm, and
their consequent reluctance to work for someone else, supported this
trend. Proposals to reverse it, by putting the ownership of land beyond
the reach of poor men, so as to promote the growth of large estates
and of a pool of landless labourers with no alternative but to work on
them, may have made some appeal to the near-squires and would-be
squires in Canada. Nevertheless, Wakefield's system, and other plans
like it, were never taken very seriously. A fundamental objection to
them was that as long as poor men could acquire farms in the United
States, attempts to deprive them of this privilege in Canada would only
drive them out of the country.19*

On the other hand, the ease with which small men became land-
owners in Canada, their unwillingness to work for others, and even
the multiplication of potential employers that followed, do not pro¬
vide the full explanation of the failure of hierarchical agriculture or
of the complexity of agriculture's labour problem. If they did, it might
be expected when the land was all taken up, that a class of landless
labourers available for hire would appear. Farmers with the most land
and the most capital would have the best chance to hire them, and to
keep them if others tried to hire them away. If the big farms proved
to be the more efficient (perhaps, even if they did not), the agricultural
economy would gradually become an organization of squires and la¬
bourers.

The fact that nothing of this sort occurred depended on a failure of
labour supply only indirectly, in the sense that supply cannot develop
far without an effective demand to support it. The essential trouble
was with demand, and less with the volume of demand than with its
unevenness over the year. Demand for agricultural labour mounted
to a great peak at harvest time. If it was economic to hire labour
through the rest of the year —as it was on large farms — it was never¬
theless true that several times as much labour as usual was required
for the harvest month. The small farmer's solution to this problem
was to employ himself fully for one month and to underemploy him¬
self during the other eleven months. The big farmer appeared to have
two choices open, though neither turned out to be very satisfactory.
He could hire on an annual basis the number of men required for har¬
vest and try to find something for them to do during the other months
— a pre-capitalistic solution. Or, trusting in the capitalistic market,
he might hope that the extra harvest hands he needed would turn up
from some source.

The best supplier of extra harvest labour was the immigrant stream.
###### After 1815, there was a good supply of immigrants in most years,
especially in the fall when they were most needed. Still, this supply


-----

depended on factors beyond local cbntrol and might fail.192 A second
possible source was the very large surplus of labour available from small
farmers who needed cash income. But this labour was blocked from a
straightforward response to market demand by whatever attentions
the settlers devoted to their own farms, by family obligations, and by
the distance between the intended labourers and employers.193 Efforts
were made in the 1830s to create a special variant of this type of labour,
more satisfactory for big farmers. Sir John Colborne and the emigra¬
tion agents tried placing immigrant families on five-acre lots, preferably
among well-to-do farmers. These smallholders, like their ancient English
prototypes, would be so dependent on the labour market that they
would take employment readily, but would be supported enough by
their holdings that they might survive long periods of unemployment.
These settlements were defended as reasonably satisfactory. However,
they were admitted to have only a limited application, and even their
proponents acknowledged that demand for these cottage labourers
was very irregular.194

A more systematic alternative for the large farmer was to hire men
on an annual basis, for an annual wage which would balance the worker's
satisfaction with continuous employment against the employer's satis¬
faction with having a man for harvest time. If employers had been
few and collusive, annual engagements might have worked well. How¬
ever, even at the beginning of the nineteenth century, this condition
was not met. "Frenchmen were frequently employed (by farmers near
Kingston), yet they could not be depended upon to remain during the
whole season. At harvest time, when large wages would be offered, the
hired man would often, without hesitation, leave his employer to go
to another who would give for a while larger wages.. ."195 At the same
time, "American" farm labourers, though more competent, were hard
to manage, "being scarce and knowing their own importance', and
would leave upon the least complaint or difficulty.196 In general, it was
"impossible to procure trusty servants, clerks &c as in Europe — Every
well doing man so easily finds means of setting up for himself that none
but the refuse will remain in the employment of others."197 Small in¬
dustrial enterprises, like farms, were unable to escape this instability
of labour supply, or would not pay the price to overcome it.198 One
consequence was a popularity of share systems in the conduct of farms
and mills by which the owner offered a share of the profit rather than
a wage to the operator.199

The final handicap to large-scale agriculture was the satisfaction
which the mass of small farmers derived from the ownership of their
homesteads. For the sake of his homestead, and the independence
which it permitted, the small farmer would accept a smaller income, if


-----

this preference, added to the difficulty of commanding a satisfactory
labour supply for the large farm, determined that no hierarchical labour
organization would persist in Canadian agriculture. If it can be said that
there ever was a solution to agriculture's labour problem, it lay in the
motivation which pride of ownership provided for a numerous yeo¬
manry. This solution was made more tolerable, and was more firmly
entrenched, by the development of farm machinery that economized
on labour, especially at harvest time.

The position of the small farmer shaded into, and was most starkly
represented by, the position of the Atlantic coast fishermen. The fish¬
ermen were notoriously dependent upon merchant-employers who
employed them under a truck system, under which fishermen were
chronically in debt to merchants, and merchants put their own prices
both upon the articles they sold and the fish they bought.200 Small
farmers in English-speaking Canada had similar relationships, in
greater or less degree, with country merchants — themselves links in
a chain of indebtedness stretching through Montreal to London.
While the local merchant was in debt himself to others, his power over
the farmer was much like that of the fish merchant over the fisher¬
man: because he was likely to be the only merchant available, and
because the farmer was typically in his debt, he could put his own valua¬
tion on the supplies he sold and on the produce he bought from the
farmer.201

Ostensibly, the relationships in these cases revolved around
"prices", in the modern sense in which prices are distinguished from
wages. The cases are variants, in fact, of the ubiquitous merchant-
employer system. They differed from paternalistic labour relation¬
ships, not because prices were involved, but because the bargaining
advantage was overwhelmingly on the employer's side. This imbal¬
ance depended, for one thing, upon the scarcity of and lack of compe¬
tition between merchants; but paternalistic relationships were also
founded upon a scarcity of employers. The essential difference of the
merchant-employer system from feudalism arose on the other side,
from the inability of fishermen and farmers to escape, or to raise
any other significant threat to, the merchant's power. Custom, law,
the hope of preserving a little property and the lack of convenient
alternatives all contributed to make the producers immobile and,
therefore, defenceless. The impotence of workers and the undisputed
power of a merchant-employer seem to have reached their possible
limit on the Saguenay, where the Price interests were able to operate
a peculiarly vicious form of debt slavery among the early settlers who
cut wood for them.202 Such situations display neither the paternalistic
virtues imposed by a scarcity of workmen and employers, nor the capi¬
talistic benefits that appear when there are many workmen and many


-----

employers. In the merchant-employer system, the merchant is a mo¬
nopolist, who can treat workmen as if they were plentiful (whether
they are or not) because they have no way to escape or retaliate.
Hence, the merchant-employer can transfer all risks to the workmen
and all profits to himself.

The conditions of personal labour organization may now be sum¬
marized. There must be a sufficient scarcity of labour (labour in a par¬
ticular place, labour of a particular skill), so that workmen enjoy about
as much bargaining advantage as their employers. Workmen must al¬
so retain their bargaining power, by preserving a power to leave or to
damage the employer by bad work. Employers must enjoy a degree of
monopoly in their labour market, so that they may expect to retain
their workmen indefinitely and be able to recover their outlays on the
workmen's overhead costs. Employers must assume these overhead
costs in order to get and hold scarce workmen; and since dismissal is
thereby made very costly to employers, the employers must find some
effective incentive other than the threat to fire. These are all essential
conditions. Some other circumstances appear to have facilitated the
appearance and persistence of personal organization. The system was
more likely if the labour required was skilled. It appeared more readily
in employments that were permanent or were carried on during the
greater part of each year. It appears to have been deemed especially
suitable when the employees required were French. However, these
circumstances were not essential to the system. Though skill, per¬
manence and Frenchmen survived, the system passed away when
workmen or employers ceased to be scarce.

###### CHAPTER III

 Canada's Labour Force: Population Growth and Migration

Canada s inadequately-supplied labour market of the eighteenth cen-
tury gave place, around 1850, to a capitalist labour market with per¬
manent reserves. The transition was accompanied and facilitated by a
rapid growth of the labour force. Mere numbers, however, could not
produce a capitalist labour market: changes in the nature and organiza¬
tion of the work force were required for that. The business of this
chapter and of the succeeding one is to examine how so fundamental
a development came about.

Though thousands of Canada s aboriginal inhabitants were, in some
sense, members of the labour force, their patterns of behaviour were
but slightly related to those that give shape and meaning to a European-
style labour market. Discussion is therefore confined to the European
population resident in Canada. Canada enjoys an unusual wealth of
census records for its European population.1 They permit close esti¬
mates to be made of the population for any date, from which the poten¬
tial membership of the labour force may be inferred.2 The actual pa-
ticipation of this potential membership in the labour market is more
difficult to state. Different ethnic groups played distinctive roles in the
development of the labour market; the character of the groups, and
the relations among them, are therefore important parts of the discus¬
sion to follow.

Canada's Population

There were about 70,000 Europeans in Canada in 1765, nearly all of
French origin. By the processes of natural increase and of immigra¬
tion, the population of the two Canadas rose to about half a million
by 1820, a little over a million and a quarter in 1844, and was reported
by the censuses to be 1,842,000 in 1851-52, 2,508,000 in 1861 and
2,812,000 in 1871.

The original French-Canadian population, despite the lack of rein¬
forcement by immigration after 1760 succeeded by a rate of natural


-----

increase of about 3 per cent per year in numbering close to a quarter
of a million in 1815, half a million about 1840 and a million in 1870.
It has always constituted the bulk of the population of the lower
province, though almost outnumbered in the cities in the middle of
the nineteenth century, and provided over half of Canada s European
population until about 1835. In the second half of the nineteenth
century, its numbers were depleted by emigration of some hundreds
of thousands to the United States. Nevertheless, it was not until
sometime in the 1850s that English-speaking Canadians contributed

a larger portion than the French of Canada's native-born.3

English-speaking Canadians multiplied particularly by immigration
after 1760. The basic stock was provided by American settlers. The
estimate that there were 25,000 persons of English speech in the
Canadas in 17844 seems to put the number too high, but the great
majority of whatever number was present were of American origin.
The same must have been true of the population of 150,000 more or
less of 1815. After that date, the American element was increasingly
mixed with, and indistinguishable from, English-speaking immi¬
grants fi;om overseas. The overseas immigrants are of the greatest
importance, not only because of their substantial contribution to the
numbers of Canada's population, but also because their character and
technical equipment played a great part in changing Canada's in¬
dustrial structure. Until 1815, overseas immigrants were largely
Highland Scots, and there may have been no more than 5,000 of them.
But immigration at Quebec set in seriously from 1816, at a rate of
about 10,000 per year in the 1820s, but rising to 50,000 a year at the
peak in the early 1830s. These immigrants were predominantly Irish,
at first almost exclusively Protestant, but with Roman Catholics
appearing in significant numbers around 1830, and becoming pre¬
dominant in the fantastic famine migrations of the late 1840s. Mean¬
while, English and Scottish immigrants contributed steadily though
unobtrusively to the totals, and in the 1850s English immigration
seems to have become as predominant as the Irish had been earlier.5

From 1842 onwards, censuses report the numbers of these immigrant
stocks in Canada. In the 1842-44 census, there were 230,000 of British
birth in Canada distributed in the ratio, English — 2, Scottish — 2,
Irish — 7. In 1851-52, the British-born numbered 410,000, in the
same ratio. By 1861, the English had gained and the Irish lost signi¬
ficantly, and in the two Canadas there were 127,000 who had been
born in England and Wales, 112,000 born in Scotland and 242,000
born in Ireland: 480,000 British-born altogether, or about one-fifth of
the total population.

French, Americans, English, Scottish and Irish together made up


-----

almost the whole of Canada's labour force in the nineteenth century
###### tach of these ethnic and cultural divisions had its own peculiar
character and its distinctive role. The present chapter discusses the
###### part played in the development of the Canadian labour market by the
French, by immigrants from the colonies that formed the United
States, and by overseas immigrants from England and Scotland.
Immigrants from Ireland will be dealt with separately in Chapter IV,
in consideration of the complexity and importance of the impact
which the Irish had on the labour market, and the space required to
deal with that subject.

###### The French-Canadians

It was the ambition of the French administration to make an agri¬
cultural community of New France, but the success achieved can
easily be exaggerated. Towards the end of the French regime, the fur
trade occupied at least 2,000 able-bodied men,6 and possibly twice
as many. Fishing and forestry, shipbuilding, iron-making and various
handicrafts, must have occupied some thousands more. Perhaps no
more than half the labour force of New France were full-time agri¬
culturalists. On the other hand, the bulk of those in non-agricultural
###### pursuits retained a foothold on the farm, from which they came and
to which they returned. Only Quebec and Montreal, with about
15,000 inhabitants between them, had truly urban populations.

French Canada has been a perennially frustrated society. Lunn
offers the view that the growing population of the colony was in 1760
"on the verge of overflowing the valley of the St. Lawrence into the
###### abundant Niagara peninsula", where a firm base for the colony could
have been established.7 A century later, Ontario was to destroy the
dream of a second Quebec in Western Canada. If New France neglected
agriculture, French society after 1760 was driven back upon the land.
Commerce fell into the hands of newcomers, the fur trade declined,
and the artisans and labourers of Lower Canada were drawn in the nine¬
###### teenth century from British immigrants. The canals and railways of
the province were built and operated by others, and the French won
only a marginal position in the timber industry. Census returns do
###### not offer a precise measure of the habitant population, but they indicate,
and other authorities agree, that a very large proportion of the French
population — perhaps 80 per cent — was in agriculture throughout
the nineteenth century.8 Concentration on one industry is not neces¬
sarily detrimental; but final frustration lay in the fact that the habitant
agriculture in which the French were confined failed to support its prac¬
titioners. Their standard of life, their satisfaction and probably their
physical condition, deteriorated.

Symptoms of the illness that beset French-Canadian society in the
###### nineteenth century appear in many directions.* Selkirk reported in
1804 that the Canadian peasantry were formerly remarkably sober,
but are now much addicted to drink — even the women exceed —
formerly it used to be disgraceful in any.. ."9 The extent of under¬
employment is suggested in a description of Boucherville in 1811.
About 10 per cent of the population of the town were available as
servants at wages of 7s. 6d. per month.™ Dr. Dunlop declared that
the French-Canadians "work for wages not much, if at all, higher
###### than those of a labourer in England."11 His opinion is supported by a
good return of wages, for 1834, which reported that the common
labourers of Lower Canada could expect 2s. 3d. per day from May to
September, 2s. in October, and Is. 6d. for the other months.12 These
sums barely exceed contemporary English wage rates, and it is not
unlikely that labour was obtainable for less from the immobile sur¬
pluses of many rural districts. According to the Durham Report, "The
circumstances of a new and unsettled country, the operation of the
French laws of inheritance, and the absence of any means of accumu¬
lation, by commerce or manufactures, have produced a remarkable
equality of properties and conditions.... The mass of the community
exhibited in the New World the# characteristics of the peasantry of
Europe. Society was dense; and even the wants and poverty which
###### the pressure of population occasions in the Old World, became not
to be wholly unknown..." Moreover, "It is impossible to exaggerate
the want of education among the habitants."13

Not all reports were gloomy. Howison said that, about 1820, the
lower classes of Montreal "carry with them an appearance of vigour,
###### contentment, and gayety, very different from the comfortless and
desponding looks that characterize the manufacturing population of
the large cities of Britain";14 and Bouchette thought, presumably about
1830, that the food of the habitants was good, though they did not eat
nearly as much meat as others.15 Similarly, a student of habitant living
standards, covering the period 1820 to 1850, concluded: "On the whole
one gathers that the general type of food consumed was much better
###### than that eaten by the English farmer of the time." But his qualification
deserves at least equal attention: "Yet again we must remind ourselves
###### that in the more backward parts of the seigniory (Mille Isles) barley
bread, salt pork, and potatoes with a little milk formed the staple diet."16
There were complaints of widespread distress and famine in the
countryside in 1817, and similar reports in 1822.17 The Durham Report

*The "crisis" in the French-Canadian economy in the early years of the nine¬
teenth century has elicited a lively debate in recent years. See Introduction,
pp. xxvi-xxvii. Ed.


-----

said of the habitants that "complaints of distress are constant, and the
deterioration of the condition of a great part of the population admitted
on all hands .. ."18

The evidence for actual physical deterioration, while not conclusive,
is strong. It may be wondered whether physical weakness was not an
important reason why the French did not seek the heavy work of canal
construction and why employers did not want them (though, oc¬
casionally, employers talked differently after a tussle with their Irish
labourers). It was claimed of French-Canadian emigrants to the United
States: "The incessant work wastes their strength; they die young, or
become prematurely infirm. The greater part of those who return are
ruined in health."19 There may have been something more than the
penny-pinching labour policies of George Simpson behind a complaint
of McLoughlin from Oregon in 1844 about the canoemen sent him:
"As you say the Boutes must be trained in this country, but the truth
is the men are so miserably small and weak for years past we cannot
find men of sufficient physical strength among the recruits to make
efficient Boutes to replace the old hands.. ."20 Thomas Brassey, who
had employed local labour all over the world on his railway projects,
recruited a large number of French-Canadians to help with the con¬
struction of the Grand Trunk. The result was stated as follows:

The French Canadians, however, except for very light work, were
almost useless. They had not physical strength for anything like
heavy work. "They could ballast, but they could not excavate. They
could not even ballast as the English navvy does, continuously
working at 'filling' for the whole day. The only way they could be
worked was by allowing them to fill the wagons, and then ride out
with the ballast to the place where the ballast was tipped, giving
them an opportunity of resting. Then the empty wagons went back
again to be filled; and so, alternately resting during the work, in
###### that way, they did very much more. They could work fast for ten
minutes and they were 'done'. This was not through idleness, but
physical weakness. They are small men, and they are a class who
are not well fed. They live entirely on vegetable food, and they
scarcely ever taste meat."21

###### Other evidence of the malaise of French-Canadian society was pro¬
vided by the unrest in the Assembly of Lower Canada, by the nationalist
movement that developed, and by the Rebellion of 1837. If the political
leaders of French Canada directed the habitant's discontent into
channels that brought him little benefit, that is nevertheless beside the
point. The habitant needed help. Some relief was found in emigration,
the major palliative in the nineteenth century for the illness of French


-----

to bolster up French society and even to reorganize it. These efforts
produced a campaign to have more land opened to settlement under
seigneurial tenure, a colonization movement, the abolition of seigneur-

13 [enLre' an<^ 3 movement f°r encouragement of manufacturing
with the aid of protective tariffs. The effectiveness of these measures
depended, of course, upon their relevance to the habitant's situation
and difficulties.

The Plight of the Habitant

There is some justice in the view that French Canada's problems stem¬
med from British domination. Alien seizure of nearly all the places that
provided wealth and power not only impoverished the French but dis¬
couraged them from attempting to escape their imprisonment in seig¬
neurial agriculture and the professions. Capitalistic practices to which
the British were addicted clashed with the institutions and ethics upon
which French Canada had been built. It could be held that British govern¬
ments, somewhat inconsistently, did further damage by supporting the
most reactionary features of the earlier regime as an aid to their own
control. Some important points can be made, however, on the other
side. At no time did the new regime deliberately prevent the French as
individuals, or as a whole, from evolving towards more rationalized and
workable ways of life: most of the clash of cultures that occurred arose,
in fact, out of attempts by the British subjects to promote "progress",
and French resistance to it. It was an illusion for French Canada to sup¬
pose that it could persist as a seventeenth-century feudal island in a
###### nineteenth-century capitalistic sea. It was a particular and fatal delusion
to imagine that seventeenth-century practices, because they had pro¬
vided a good solution to the problem of how to organize a society in the
###### seventeenth century, could go on giving a good solution indefinitely.
By the nineteenth century, they offered no solution at all. Yet the
###### habitant did not want to abandon them, and he escaped from them,
when he was forced into it, only with the greatest difficulty. This is
the essence of the habitant problem.

The feudal system of New France had been designed to facilitate set¬
tlement by requiring the seigneur to provide all the necessary capital,
###### thus leaving "to the settler the free use of all his pecuniary resources at
the most critical period".22 In this aim, the system was extremely suc¬
cessful and compares favourably with the freehold system by which
poor men had to struggle desperately to amass the little capitals re¬
quired for their holdings. The system also took account of the future in
###### that the uncleared lands of the province were held by the seigneurs "in trust for (the habitants) and for their descendents".23

The price paid for this facility of settlement was, however, very high.
In the seigneurial system the habitant not only had little need to save, he


-----

was also hindered in doing so by payments made to seigneur and
church, and was generally encouraged in a non-capitalistic and non-
accumulative attitude, in which existence was a sufficient justification
for existence. In the early years, when there seemed to be plenty of land
for all, the attitude assumed by the habitant may not have mattered
much, but in the nineteenth century, when French society was in crisis,
it closed one door to a solution. It was doubly closed because, by that
time, it was much harder for the peasant to save anything, and especial¬
ly hard for the poor peasant, who needed land the most. These are the
men of whom it was fairly said, "that in denying them the power of
acquiring land under (feudal) tenure, they are virtually excluded from
the market when crown lands are put up for sale."24 A more general
###### statement of the problem is:

It is well known on what ruinous terms Canadian settlers will take
lands in some situations. Our youth has but two alternatives — to
expatriate themselves, or to take up lands at any price.... Thus,
there are... almost everywhere in the inhabited part of Lower
###### Canada... a surplus of population ready to overflow any tract of
land which is accessible, whatever may be its quality and price. The
only requisite is that there shall be nothing to pay down; if the soil
is good, they hope to clear themselves in time; if it is bad, and the
seller is pressing for payment, they do what they can with the
wood and a few exhausting crops, which ruin the soil for ever .. ,25

Thus, there arose a class who would do anything to get land except
save for it. There was nothing from which to save in their own situa¬
tions. They might have earned money, as immigrants did, but to do this
they would have had to divorce themselves from their society, and they
were badly equipped for employment. It is significant that immigrants
with a similar background to that of the habitant rarely earned their
way to proprietorship either. James Stephen was much less profound
than he thought when he ruled that "it is absurd and unmeaning to say,
###### that people will not settle on Lands, merely because they are discharged
from feudal services."26

Behind the lack of money to pay down was the absence of a system
###### that provided incomes from which surpluses could be squeezed. A free¬
hold system presupposes both substantial income and substantial ex¬
pense within an exchange economy; the balancing of these, with skill
and good fortune, can produce surplus. Such a system also implies sur¬
pluses of grain available for sale and, perhaps, export — in capitalistic
logic, these are the only justifications of an agriculture in the first place.
The habitant had been conditioned in an environment, however, in
which it was hard to make surpluses appear and in which surpluses


-----

riculture of New France very nearly reached a position by which the
market for farm produce and a surplus-producing agriculture might
have promoted and justified each other; but this advance was never
realized.27 The habitant turned his back on profit-oriented agriculture
and became incapable of responding to price stimuli.23 His inertia, like
###### that of the Irishman, rested on the improbability of any reward for ef-
ort. Again, about 1800, there was promise of an agricultural economy
based on exports and profits; but prices became unfavourable, markets
closed, and this chance faded away too.2* The response of the habitant
was to fasten even more firmly on an economy of self-sufficiency in
which, because sales were small, survival lay in keeping costs smaller.
As population thickened, there was progressively less chance of operat¬
ing in any other way.

A structure oriented against risk, surplus and accumulation is harm¬
ful enough, but the French position was made still worse by the system
of inheritance in vogue: farms were divided equally between all the
direct heirs and, in the name of justice and equality, divided into strips
which became narrower and narrower. Already in the 1740s, the ad¬
###### ministrators of New France had thought it necessary to take drastic
steps against this ribbon fragmentation, on which they blamed declin¬
ing output, at a time when no one could suppose any absolute shortage
of land.30 But subdivision continued, until, according to Munro:

The habitants were as a class showing signs of restlessness and dis¬
###### content during the earlier thirties. Under the influence of the
French law of succession, their domains had been divided and sub¬
divided until a holding, in the peculiar shape which it retained,
would scarcely have sufficed to support a family even had the hab¬
###### itant adopted up-to-date methods of cultivation. This he did not do:
his methods were for the most part those of his great-grandfather
of the old French epoch. Fertilization of the land was rare; syste¬
matic rotation of crops would have been most difficult on the
###### narrow strip of land which he held; and implements showed little
or no improvement. If anything, the habitant was at this time worse
off than he had been before the conquest; for while his average
holding was much smaller, neither his seignior nor his church had
in the least relaxed its demands upon him.. ,31

It is from this background that the claim that there was a shortage of
land in the nineteenth century has to be viewed. The assertion was
made very freely and was given particular sanction by the Durham
Report, which cited a claim that the population of the seigneuries had
more than quadrupled between 1784 and 1826, while the quantity of
land under cultivation had increased only by a third.32 It is surprising to
find, then, when the statistics available are examined, that the amount


-----

of land per rural household does not appear to have been much different
in the nineteenth century than it had been in the eighteenth.33 Of
course the statistics, like the loose claims which they are intended to
correct, must be taken with some reserve. In particular, the inclusion as
time went on of prosperous farms in the Townships and of extensive
but otherwise unattractive holdings of colonists, probably pulled up the
averages and thereby obscured the deterioration on the old seigneuries.
But the statistics do suggest that shortage of land in an absolute sense
was not the basic trouble; and, on the other hand, give a certain support
for English puzzlement why, if land was short, habitants did not work
their holdings better or take land under freehold tenure. Aversion to
freehold has already been touched on. The poor use made of existing
lands deserves more attention.

Some reasons for the habitant's bad farming have already been
noted: the awkward shape of the farms, the lack of markets to encourage
improvement, the lack of capital to finance better methods. There is also
the question of the habitant's concentration on wheat as a crop. This
emphasis was often condemned, the only question being whether it was
primarily a consequence of peasant obstinacy or of the demands made
on the habitant by seigneur and church.34 On the other hand, the habi¬
tant's methods have been defended by Professor Fowke. Fowke argued
###### that extensive farming was much better suited to the habitant's situa¬
tion than zealots of "high farming" allowed; and, therefore, that it was
economically sound for him to desire to extend his area of cultivation
while the lands presently cultivated were still capable of producing
much more. His reason: "The St. Lawrence region did not always pro¬
duce sufficient cereals for its needs, but it produced cereals with less
difficulty than it experienced in the production of livestock."35

This is a qualified endorsement of the habitant's methods and effi¬
ciency, at best. But what is much more serious, it fails to take account of
a capital fact of history: the failure, year after year, of the Lower Cana¬
dian wheat crop. That this chronic failure has been so often overlooked
is, in retrospect, surprising. There is no lack of evidence about it. It is
implicit, for instance, in the statistics of wheat output in Table II, which
were recorded without any reference to this matter. It was stated plain¬
ly by enough observers. For example, the report of the Legislative
Committee on Emigration of 1849 includes the following statement:
"As long as the crops continued good, these small farms were sufficient
for the wants of their proprietors; but for about ten years past the
wheat crop has failed. In no one of the parishes in this part of the
country (Quebec district) has a sufficient crop been gathered to feed
one half of its population, which increases every year..."36 Yet, only
in the recent work of W.H. Parker, a geographer, has the nature and

Parker found that in the 1830s (especially 1835-37) and the 1840s
there occurred a catastrophic failure of the wheat crop of Lower Ca¬
nada. The failure affected in particular the old, rich lands — the seig-
neuries and the bread basket of the Montreal plain. It was accompanied
and obscured by a rapid expansion of wheat production on new lands
outside the older (and basically more favourable) regions of cultivation.
Parker suggested three aspects of the wheat failure that deserve atten¬
tion. In the first place, the areas affected by the crop failure were so ex¬
actly the areas which actively supported the Rebellion of 1837 in the
lower province, that a very close relationship between these pheno¬
mena must be supposed. Secondly, though the wheat fly was the im¬
mediate "cause" of the crop failures, Parker pointed out that crops on
new lands nearby withstood the ravages of the fly with no apparent dif¬
ficulty; he deduced that the essential cause of the crop failure was ex¬
haustion of the soil. Thirdly, since the agricultural heartland of Lower
Canada was forced to turn permanently to other crops than wheat,
while newer and poorer lands were incapable of producing wheat very
well or in very large quantities, the province was henceforth doomed to
be incapable of wheat exports, or even of feeding itself. A fourth con¬
clusion can be drawn: the dense population of the old seigneuries had
exceptional reason in the 1830s and 1840s to think that land was short
and to seek opportunities elsewhere.

This is bad enough; but to set out the problem fully, it is necessary to
notice the total nature of habitant society. It furnishes a classic example
of that type of peasant community, most common in Celtic lands, which
practised subdivision in the inheritance of land.38 It is obvious that after
division has been several times repeated in such a society, no heir will
possess enough land to support him. But this is only part of the difficulty
###### that arises. In communities like this, the prospect of an inheritance
(however small) prevents dispersion and encourages rapid population
growth. The community contains abudant surplus labour, which is at¬
tracted to seasonal employment in an effort to support the farm that
cannot support the farmer, but does not seek permanent wage em¬
ployment. The society does not shake loose the sons made surplus by
subdivision. Neither, in its equality of poverty, does it induce them to
learn those inventions that are supposed to follow from necessity.
Instead, it encourages them to meet their problems by accepting lower
and lower living standards, and from the resulting impoverishment of
body and mind it inhibits them from seeking out a solution to their prob¬
lem. The tone of such societies is antagonistic to change and to capital¬
istic rationality. Their members are incapable of saving themselves —
though they might postpone catastrophe by war, or by serving in the
British army, or by finding more land under seigneurial tenure. In


-----

of French-Canadian society was not quite so brutal and simple, but it,
too, had to be dissolved through outside pressures and internal ferment.

The Ferment of French Society

The difficulty with efforts of peasant societies like that of French
Canada to survive by turning inwards and intensifying peasant values,
is that they can be effective only for a time. Eventually, the stresses
within the society become unbearable.

The safety valve for French society in the nineteenth century was
found in emigration. Emigration is usually dated from about 1837, but it
had appeared much earlier. "From the French portion of Lower Canada
###### there has, for a long time, been a large annual emigration of young men
to the northern states of the American Union, in which they are highly
valued as labourers, and gain good wages, with their savings from
which they generally return to their homes in a few months or years."39
This temporary movement was the typical reaction of overdivided pea¬
###### sant communities, in which heirs receive enough to hinder their per¬ manent departure, but not enough to live on, and in which there is a
chronic surplus of unskilled labour. Ireland and many parts of Europe
offered parallels for it. The significance of the year 1837 lay in the fact
###### that emigration increased sharply, for both economic and political rea¬
sons, and a substantial part of it gave the appearance of permanent
removal.40 There was a notable extension of the districts of Lower
Canada affected by emigration from 1841 on, and a relatively large
movement from about 1845, related to a variety of unfavourable econ¬
omic conditions. This emigration was estimated at 4,000 persons per
year, consisting two-thirds of habitants and one-third of wage earners.
Families went to the cotton mills of New England, but were claimed to
###### return in a few years. Of the young single men, "scarcely two-thirds" returned.41 Despite the circulation of reports of dreadful experiences of
many emigrants in the United States, the outflow increased in volume
and took on a character of permanent alienation. The greatest move¬
###### ment, based upon a large-scale penetration of New England's milltowns
to replace the Irish, who had so recently replaced Americans, occurred
shortly after I860.42 It has been estimated that there were 400,000
French-Canadians in the United States in 18 73,43 and that half a million
###### went there between 1860 and 1890.44 The movement never lost its
peasant character of a migratory one; but, more and more, it took on the
appearance of that other peasant movement, the final desperate aban¬
###### donment of the old land. Regarded as a calamity by the leaders of French
society, this emigration nevertheless was the means essential to pre¬
###### vent the pressures within French society from reaching an explosive
level, and the means also to retard its fundamental reorganization.

Emigration played a great indirect role in the reconstruction of


-----

French society, however, by stimulating questioning and discussion,
and by promoting an atmosphere more conducive to change. Those
who returned from the United States with "advanced" ideas acquired
there, provided a leaven for the society; while local leaders were forced
by emigration to wrestle seriously, for the first time, with economic
problems. The colonization movement that arose from this self-exam¬
ination was less helpful than its proponents imagined, and the anti¬
luxury movement was positively pernicious. But there did emerge a
broad nationalist movement which supported on the economic side the
extension of settlement in Lower Canada and elsewhere; the modern¬
ization of the economy by the abolition of seigneurial tenure and by
improved communications; and the growth of manufacturing aided by
tariff protection.

The extension of settlement seemed a logical way to meet the pres¬
sure on the land in Lower Canada, and, for reasons already noted, there
was a widespread desire that the settlement should be made under seig¬
neurial tenure. An approach to the economic conditions of this tenure
was made under the colonization movement, promoted vigorously after
1849 and again in the 1870s.45 Settlement did occur, though probably it
should be regarded as the consequence of migrations in progress, rather
###### than of promotion.46 An important result of it was the rise of vigorous
new communities in the north that provided a focus for fresh attacks on
the province's problems.47 Meanwhile in the Eastern Townships, as
in New England, French-Canadians showed their capacity to succeed
English-speaking farmers by accepting a lower living standard; yet they
carried on more efficient practices than those of the seigneuries.48
Many habitants were provided for in these ways, and yet settlement did
not greatly relieve habitant difficulties; for only in a remote sense was
land shortage their cause.

A curious campaign by members of the clergy against "luxury" was
still less effective or relevant. The clergy opposed emigration to the
United States and proposed, in its place, colonization within Lower
Canada. Inevitably, this involved hardships for the colonists. Especially
was the program undermined when substantial numbers emigrated
from the frontier regions marked for colonization, as seems to have
been the case in the 1840s.49 It was more alarming still that a boom in
New England manufactures, involving particularly strong demands for
labour in 1869 and in 1872-73, could so encourage emigration that a
###### quarter to a third of all the farms in Quebec were abandoned by June
1873 — even though many habitants returned like penitents when the
bubble burst.50 Clerical writers, therefore, put "luxury" as the first
cause of emigration, proposing in effect that the habitant should stay
home and accept however low a standard of living this implied.51 The

subsistence farming and withdrawal from exchange economy. In fact,
however, the habitant developed new wants in the nineteenth century,
providing grounds for clerical complaint, but providing a basis also for a
healthier economy.

It seems probable that dependence on home manufactures increased
###### after 1760, when the French were pushed back on the land. However,
Bouchette reported that homespun clothing was giving way to goods
imported from Britain in about 1830.52 There was a marked increase in
farm indebtedness in the 1840s,53 due partly to crop failures, but due
also to increasing exchange. Clerical spokesmen asserted at this time
###### that home manufactures were being abandoned and that farmers
bought luxury" articles on credit, with the consequence that some fell
into hopeless debt and were forced to emigrate.54 Especially from the
###### 1860s to the 1890s, it was said, contentment with simple home-made
things was superseded by a taste for horses and carriages, houses and
furnishings (including pianos). The merchants flourished, but the habi¬
###### tants debts became unbearable, and again they emigrated.55 The habi¬ tants certainly were drawn into exchange economy in these decades,
most of all by new means of transportation and by the economic special¬
ization which they supported.56 Obsolete agricultural methods were
replaced by better ones,57 a benefit which the clergy, more or less un¬
wittingly, would have frustrated. However, the clergy, inconsistently,
supported education to improve farming methods and the new system
of inheritance that became common about 1850 to protect holdings
against further subdivision. The new system required the single heir to
a farm to assume obligations towards his brothers and sisters more or
less equivalent to their former shares of the land; and it was alleged that
this imposed impossible burdens on the heir, and often forced him to
abandon his farm.58 However that might be, the system of single-heir
inheritance was of great value in shaking non-inheritors loose from the
land and depositing them unequivocally elsewhere.

A product of the new atmosphere sponsored by distress and emigra¬
tion was the abolition of seigneurial tenure in 1854, hard on the heels of
agitation for its extension as an aid to settlement. What the Patriotes of
###### 1838 had in mind in their advocacy of abolition was the repudiation of
seigneurial dues and of tithes.59 In the event, abolition in Lower Can¬
ada, as in most other places, imposed slight hardship on the seigneurs
and gave little relief to the habitants.60 What, then, was it supposed to
do? By removing the seigneurial class, it eliminated the only check upon
the power of the Church within French-Canadian society. But it seems
unlikely that abolition was promoted to accomplish this result. A great
deal was made of seigneurial obstruction to the use of Lower Canadian
###### water power for manufacturing. In the 1840s, a representative of the
clergy denounced seigneurs who "have refused and still refuse every


-----

day to encourage the establishrhent of profitable works and useful
manufactures for the country in order to retain exclusively, without
benefit to themselves or the public, the numerous water-powers owned
by them, and for which they are offered reasonable prices."61 But there
is little evidence that seigneurs generally were less likely than others to
develop their water power, and it is nonsense to suppose that the habi¬
###### tants could have undertaken such development.62 Cooper found the
merit of abolition in the rise of agricultural specialization in Quebec, and
in the abandonment of emphasis on grain crops which, he says, was
forced by the seigneurs in their hunger for rents.63 But, aside from the
question of who it was, exactly, who had insisted upon the growing of
grain, this attributes both greater and quicker effects to abolition than
the step entailed. The rather slow shift to livestock that occurred in the
province seems to have been a product, first, of the inability of the
old lands to grow wheat any longer; secondly, of inability to compete
against more efficient wheat producers elsewhere; and, thirdly, of the
gradual growth of a market for farm products other than wheat. What
can be said for the abolition of seigneurial tenure is that it let the habi¬
###### tant feel the forces of the market more directly than hitherto.

The most plausible explanation for abolition is that it was the work of
###### that important group of French-Canadian leaders of the nineteenth
century who accepted capitalistic or English doctrines of economic pro¬
gress: they desired to transform the peasant into a farmer responsive to
the market, and the local economy into one capable of producing sur¬
pluses and investing them. While it was not so much the seigneurial
system as such, but rather a peasant structure antecedent to it, that
"made it difficult, indeed, impossible, for the mass of the French-
Canadian population to accumulate capital, to develop industries, to
acquire technical skills and to develop attitudes and aspirations condu¬
cive to industrial enterprise",64 abolition helped to overcome the prevail¬
ing subsistence economy. Spectacular results were not to be expected,
particularly in view of the extreme tenderness shown for the interests
of seigneurs. But this change, along with others, made the habitant's
behaviour significantly more consistent with economic rationality by
the 1870s.

A further major consequence of distress and emigration was a
movement to make Lower Canada a manufacturing centre with the aid
of protective tariffs. Agitation to this end was not new in the 1840s, but
the advantage of the province in respect to abundant cheap labour and
abundant cheap water power was given particular emphasis at that
time, as was the desirability of protection. Industrialization became
a permanent goal of French-Canadian nationalism, as well as of unhy¬
phenated Canadian nationalism. What has to be said of the industrial¬


-----

L°Wer tKat 3 great part °f what there was' was established and
manned by English-speaking residents; and that much of the rest was
t e work of French-Canadians who had acquired new techniques and
new attitudes in the United States.** The small size of the local market
and the competition of mature foreign producers were hindrances to
development. But the ancient structure and attitudes of peasant society
were greater ones. The habitants entered the labour market reluc¬
tantly. They lacked skill and capital and did not have much will or power
to acquire them. Their disabilities were more burdensome for the indus¬
tries of their home province than for the developed industries of New
England. Emigration to New England implied a break with the past and
an acceptance of new attitudes. American firms were long established,
well equipped with capital and management and technical skill. For the
textile mills, the physical weakness of the French-Canadian was of little
consequence, while his nimble fingers, his large family, his docility and
his willingness to work for small wages, were all points in his favour.
What home industries particularly needed — capital and management
and technical skill — the habitant could not supply. Even as an unskilled
employee, he may have been less willing to accept a new role in his home
province. The one thing he could offer was a low rate of wages. But low
wages do not necessarily make low labour costs, and the uncertain pro¬
gress of manufacturing in Quebec raises doubt that they did so there.
In any case, cheap unskilled labour can only support a narrow range of
industries. Processes that demanded skill arose rather in Ontario or
were carried on in Quebec by English-speaking workers. In time,
French-Canadians learned them too. But for the most part, French
Canada clung to peasant ways and paid the price for them of limited
opportunities and low incomes.

###### French-Canadians and the Labour Market

The paradoxical relation of the French-Canadian population to the
labour market in the nineteenth century can now be summarized. A
###### great deal of very cheap unskilled labour was available in particular
places at certain seasons. But, except for the small force of traditional
wage earners, like the shipyard workers, French-Canadians were not
really in the labour market. They were not really out of it, either: they
occupied a residual position, for labour could be obtained with some ef¬
fort. However, the peasant's attitude to the market was negative. He
scarcely offered any competition to immigrants for the jobs, many of
them labouring jobs, which they took in Lower Canada, and he made
little effort to fill other openings, like the annual one for several hun¬
dred sailors at Quebec. The chief reason was that the habitant wanted
###### nothing to do with this alien world, except sometimes to earn a few
dollars so that he could carry on at home. Eventually and painfully, this


-----

peasant economy was transformed. People were shaken loose from
peasant society by overpopulation and overdivision and foreclosure.
They migrated with the intention to return, and clung to peasant ways
in distant cities. In time, they acquired industrial knowledge and disci¬
pline and had something to offer besides willingness to work cheaply.
Meanwhile, a slow modernization of Quebec agriculture made the tran¬
sition to industrial life cleaner and easier for later generations. Yet, even
in the twentieth century, the French workman carried an awkward
burden of traditional restraints.66 In the nineteenth century, it is more
proper to say that he was a potential or marginal member, rather than
an actual member, of the labour force.*

The Americans

The second contribution to the settlement of Canada by Europeans was
made from the United States after 1760. Some Americans came early
as traders; there are supposed to have been about 6,800 Loyalists in
Canada in 1785;67 and during the next thirty years there was a substan¬
tial influx of Americans who were relatively indifferent to Canada's
form of government, but responsive to its potential farm lands. This
inflow represented branches of the westward migration of the American
people.68 To an extent the newcomers settled in the cities and on the
old lands of Canada, but their distictive contribution was the peopling
of Upper Canada and of the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada. There
must have been more than 100,000 of them in Canada by 1815, and they
must have provided 80 per cent or more of the English-speaking popu¬
lation at that date.69 The Americans and their descendants set the tone
of Canada's English-speaking regions until about 1840, and they re¬
mained influential thereafter, although increasingly indistinguishable
from later British arrivals in most parts of the provinces.

Whereas Canada's French population was bound in a pre-capitalist
peasant mould, the American immigrants stood at the opposite extreme
of full acceptance of economic rationality. That class of Loyalists with
aristocratic pretensions who represented a remnant of European feud¬
alism went predominantly to the Maritime provinces. Those who came
to Canada carried the political conception of an equalitarian lower-
middle-class democracy. In economic affairs, they accepted the market
###### without any evident inhibitions. The bulk of them became proprietors,
so that insofar as they entered the labour market at all, it was as em¬
ployers. But they had no objection in principle to taking wage employ¬
ment, so completely had money evaluation displaced status evaluation.
As McTaggart noted, the Yankees would not work on the Rideau canal,
but this was for the plain reason that they could see no money in it.70


-----

They were very ready to do canal work when they saw a prospect for
profit. A little earlier, Americans in Canada seem to have been quite
ready to take employment to save for a farm or to support one already
possessed.72 But even the Americans employed as farm labourers dis¬
played markedly bourgeois attitudes. They knew that they were a
skilled, scarce kind of farm labourer. They stipulated for good pay, were
extremely touchy in respect to any kind of criticism or mistreatment
and insisted upon eating at the family table, thus disconcerting some
farmers with British notions.72 It was asserted that "New Englanders
will not hire by the year".7! On the other hand, Americans were ready
to work much harder than British immigrants.75

The artisans of Canada's English-speaking settlements also were
supplied in the early period by the United States. Innkeepers, millers,
mechanics and lumbermen, along with farmers, made up the original
American immigrations.76 It was itinerant American pedlars and me¬
chanics who catered to the needs of the pioneer settlements of Upper
Canada.77 As masters and journeymen — the line between was crossed
easily— Americans supplied the mechanics' class of the towns of Upper
Canada, and established the reputation for political interest and inso¬
lence of the mechanics that enraged opponents of democratic institu¬
tions.78 The character of the artisan class was modified after 1837 by a
changed political atmosphere and by British immigration. Nevertheless,
###### where there was constant intercourse with the artisans of American
cities and migration back and forth, as remained true of Toronto and
particularly of Hamilton, a strong American flavour was retained.

But most Americans became proprietors of farms. As the pioneers of
agriculture, they were professional and indispensable. As farmers,
however, they left so much to be desired that even Fowke's argument
###### that Canada's economic position called for extensive and superficial
agriculture, can hardly cover them.79 But by the criterion that interest¬
ed them, they were decidedly successful. They quickly amassed cattle
and buildings and more or less improved land. It was characteristic
of them to build substantial frame houses while others were barely
launched upon their log cabin stage.80 There could be no question that
###### they would produce for the market, foster exchange and endeavour to
accumulate. In contrast to the habitants, they responded sharply to
changes in the prices of agricultural products.81 They were more than
ready to cultivate new wants and to lower their level of self-sufficiency
###### the moment the market made that possible.82 When labour was scarce
in the 1850s, they shifted readily to mechanized production.83 Yet,
###### they were perhaps more interested in speculative returns than in pedes¬
trian ones from methodical production, and the appreciation of land
values played a central part in their calculations.84

People who had developed the attitudes required to deal successfully


-----

with the conditions of pioneering'could not be expected to excel in social
graces. Adverse criticisms of the Americans in Canada rested partly on
prejudice, but it was true that in repudiating every piece of cultural
equipment that was not essential in the backwoods in preparation for
their hard task, they ignored much that lends distinction to societies.
They were vulgar; they did not value rank, or learning, or education, or
even preachers, but only acquisition.85 Though active and sagacious,
they were litigious and unscrupulous.86 McTaggart even asserted that
Americans showed no passion of love for the opposite sex, as "we" do.87
If this was so, it represented the most remarkable victory of the econo¬
mic calculus.

The character of the American influx ensured the rapid economic
development of Canada, but it ensured also that Americans would not
have a large place in the labour market. This was so, not because the
Americans had any inhibitions in respect to the market as the French
had, but because the bulk of them became small farmers who were
neither employees nor employers. American artisans and the small
body of American labourers were keen, capable, but inclined to be indiv¬
idualistic in their bargaining. As employers, Americans usually showed
a great deal of capacity. They seem to have got on well with their em¬
ployees, and they were largely, if not entirely, free from the attitude of
outrage cultivated by British-born employers in respect to American
wage rates. They accepted the market, paid the wages necessary to at¬
tract the labour they required, or abandoned their project if it could not
support current wage rates. On the other hand, they were inclined to
react with emotional hostility to combination among their employees to
a greater extent than employers with different backgrounds. When
abundant labour supplies and new market possibilities appeared in
Canada, new American immigrants along with old ones hastened to
exploit the opportunities and to build a capitalist structure.88

Canada's Immigrants: An Overview89

Immigration to Canada from Europe set in seriously in 1816. Until the
1850s, when Germans and Norwegians appeared in some numbers, the
immigrants were almost exclusively from the British Isles. The great
bulk of these immigrants came as individuals or families, without any
particular help or direction, though frequently in the company of kins¬
men or friends.90

By force of geography, most immigrants from overseas entered Ca¬
nada at Quebec, at which port the British government maintained an
Emigration Agent from 1828. It was easy therefore to keep a record of
entries, and reasonably accurate statistics of arrivals by way of the St.
Lawrence exist from 1816. Some immigrants, perhaps 10 per cent, were


-----

at Quebec proceeded to the United States, sooner more often than
later, accurate immigration statistics would tell little about the numbers
of persons added to the Canadian population. In addition, a considerable
###### number of immigrants came to Canada by way of New York. No one
counted this traffic across the border, and while attempts have been
made to determine its net consequences,93 the results can only be esti¬
mates. The only statistics that afford a measure of the contribution of
British immigrants to Canada's population are those of the censuses,
and censuses did not show the place of birth of the Canadian population
until the 1840s.

The statistics of immigrant arrivals by way of the St. Lawrence are
nevertheless useful. They show, in the first place, the extent to which
European migration to North America proceeded through Canadian, as
against American, ports. From 1819 to 1835, Quebec (and still more,
British North America) drew far more British immigrants than did the
ports of the United States. From 1835 to 1847, Quebec was behind New
York as an immigrant port but retained a respectable competitive posi¬
tion. After 1847, the St. Lawrence could attract only about one-fifth as
many British immigrants as American ports did, and its position in re¬
spect to total Atlantic migration was more unfavourable still.

Quebec's immigration figures show, secondly, the number of persons
exposed each year for hire in Canada. Most immigrants would have
been content to accept employment in Canada, had suitable employ¬
###### ment been offered. The fact that so many went on to the United States,
either directly or after some period of employment, is simply a measure
of the limited capacity of the Canadian labour market. But it is impor¬
###### tant to observe the advantage enjoyed by Canadian employers: a stream
of people passing their doors into which they could dip easily for labour
when they wanted it. After 1815, population statistics give an inade¬
quate picture of the supply of labour available in Canada; only when the
numerous, eminently mobile immigrants are taken into account can the
###### true abundance of supply be appreciated. It may be doubted whether
any other country in the world was so favourably placed in this respect.
Certainly none which enjoyed a reserve of labour had so convenient a
way to rid itself of the surplus as simply to allow the surplus to proceed
to the United States.93

The statistics tell, finally, what part of the arrivals were English, Irish
and Scottish. Since each ethnic group had peculiar traits, this is an im¬
###### portant kind of information. The statistics would have been more help¬
ful still if they had distinguished Highland from Lowland Scots and
(more important) Ulster from southern Roman Catholic Irish. But some
guidance on these points, and on the proportions of peasant-labourers,
artisans and substantial farmers, is provided by the comments of Emi¬
gration Agents.

Canadian immigration was part of a vast phenomenon, "The Atlantic
Migration . Students of this movement have inquired into the goals of
the migrants, the means of their transport and the conditions of their
homelands. What the migrants sought in America is scarcely in ques¬
tion: it was superior economic opportunities. Means of transport are
###### important because they determined very largely the volume and direc¬
tion of migration. The technical improvement of ocean and land trans¬
###### port in the nineteenth century facilitated migration; but this was a
development that came too late for the migration that made the Cana¬
dian labour market, and its predominant effect was to divert immigrants
from Canadian to American ports. The development of great staple
export trades from North America to Europe was of much greater im¬
portance for migration until late in the nineteenth century. The great
trades settled into well-defined shipping routes that determined for
most migrants their destination in America. Most of the trades involved
a bulky cargo to Europe, but bulky return cargoes were rarely to be
found. The pressure of overhead costs therefore induced shipowners
to cater to emigrants as a return cargo, and to offer very low fares when
this was required — as it usually was — to fill their ships.94 Without
###### attention to the Atlantic traffic in tobacco and cotton, the nature of a
great share of Atlantic migration would be unintelligible. But no com¬
modity trade was more momentous for migration than the timber trade
of British North America. Its character led to the provision of the most
numerous, the cheapest and the roughest passages to America at a cru¬
cial time, when multitudes who could barely afford to pay a fare of £2
per adult head wanted to leave Europe, and at crucial places, the ports
convenient for these persons. The timber trade does not explain the
###### outpouring from Britain after 1815, but it does explain why so many
who wished to go were able to go, and why they shipped for British
###### North American ports.

The question why so many Europeans were willing to go to America
is far more intricate. That economic conditions were generally better in
America, and that most Europeans so believed, has little direct bearing
on this question, since inert humankind seldom abandons a customary
###### environment except under strong or even overwhelming pressures.
The most comprehensive approach to an answer was offered by Marcus
Lee Hansen. He distinguished three stages in the migration of the nine¬
###### teenth century, each related to the land-holding system and population
pressures of a part of Europe: "Celtic" migration, 1830-60; Teutonic
migration, 1860-90; Mediterranean and Slavic migration, 1890-1914.
Hansen called his first stage "Celtic" because the regions affected above
all others were Ireland, the Highlands of Scotland and the mountains of
Wales, "regions where the language and blood were predominantly Cel¬


-----

of the early tribes".95 The Upper Rhine and other parts of Europe from
which many emigrated before 1860 were held by Hansen also to be Cel¬
tic, possibly in blood, certainly in agricultural practices. Hansen does not
make the logic of his generalization very precise. Communal systems
of holding and cultivating land, excessive subdivision, disruption of
ancient economies from the inroads of capitalist concepts in agriculture,
rapid population growth facilitated by potato culture, medical advances
and the suppression of local wars, all seem to play a part. Ulster, the
greatest of all the early sources of emigration, does not fit the "Celtic"
###### pattern closely. But it is a fact that pressures of the type noted by Han¬
sen are all too evident in Celtic lands; it is a fact that regions that follow¬
ed Celtic agricultural practices developed extreme imbalances which
sooner or later provoked wholesale emigration; and finally, it is a fact
###### that early migrations were predominantly from Celtic areas.

The second, Teutonic, migration also found its unity in a system of
land-holding, that of undivided farms which forced non-inheriting sons
to seek their fortunes elsewhere. The distinction has been pursued by
Habakkuk, who argues that regions of subdivision are likely to exper¬
ience more rapid population growth than others, that they invite sea¬
sonal migrant labour and cottage industries, but that they tend to retain
their population growth until a crisis drives it forth in a kind of stam¬
pede; while regions of undivided land-holdings contribute a smaller but
regular and orderly flow of outcasts.96 It is not difficult to see how the
undivided holding can produce potential emigrants, and it is a fact that
there was a great outpouring from regions of undivided holdings in
England, Germany and Scandinavia, especially between 1860 and 1890.
It is not immediately clear, on the other hand, why the Teutonic lands
would not have contributed a regular flow of migrants from much ear¬
lier times; and it has to be taken into account that a region of undivided
holdings, Ulster, did provide a regular stream of emigrants from the
seventeenth century. The argument seems to require some refinement.
Habakkuk suggests that regions of single-heir inheritance offer the best
possibilities for industrial advance, because the mobility of labour facil¬
itates industrial development at the best locations in respect to other
factors than labour, and because such regions can produce food surplus¬
es to support industrial cities.97 On the whole, European industrial de¬
velopment did take place in such Teutonic regions. It would follow that
such regions would not require the safety-valve of emigration in some
periods because surplus farm population could find a place in industrial
centres. On the other hand, because industrial populations were part¬
icularly prolific,98 and because the growth of demand for industrial
labour has been notably uneven, such areas might easily provide sub¬
stantial numbers of emigrants in other periods. It is significant that


-----

1860 to 1890, and that this was a period of industrial development
in America and of relative stagnation in Great Britain. Ulster may
###### represent a special case, its industrial development being so often im-
peded by political and economic obstacles, and its labour force so pecu-
liarly placed with one foot in agriculture and the other in manufacturing,
###### that its emigration became a regular phenomenon."

Some other general statements concerning migration can be made.
When migrants had a choice of destinations, their decision was likely to
###### rest upon considerations that seem inconsequential in retrospect. The
level of ocean fares was particularly vital, even in the period when fares
were low by either earlier or later standards. So crucial was this factor
###### that emigrants (especially Irish emigrants) divided themselves into
segments whose destinations depended upon the amount of fare they
could afford. The poorest Irish went to Lancashire; the next lot to (or
via) New Brunswick; those a little better off to Quebec; and the most
affluent to New York.100 The reputation of an emigrant route with re¬
spect to mortality — Quebec's reputation was usually bad — also played
a part. It follows that emigration could be diverted in a substantial
###### amount from one route to another by propaganda, taxes and subsidies,
and it was so diverted from time to time. But it was also true that the
volume of emigration to any destination was governed very closely by
its level of prosperity and the experience of recent immigrants in finding
employment; above all, it was governed by the availability of work for
labourers in constructing canals or railways. It was literally true that the
###### great periods of emigration to Canada in the nineteenth century were
those during which such labouring jobs were plentiful, and the periods
when immigration was low were those during which construction jobs
were scarce.101 In such years as 1819 and 1842 when jobs were easier to
find in Canada than in the United States, migration tended to swing in
Canada's direction; but the reverse also was true. The powerful pull of
the United States in the last half of the nineteenth century mirrored its
rapid expansion and Canada's stagnation.

It is a general truth that patterns of social behaviour in European
communities, in Celtic ones especially, inhibited movement. But it was
equally true that, once emigration had begun, new patterns of beha¬
viour developed which had as much momentum and compulsion as the
old. A habit of migration was as difficult to stop as it was to start, and the
name "mania" frequently applied to it does not seem inappropriate.
Religious and political persecution, though they provoked the emigra¬
tion of very few people directly, may have been of critical importance in
introducing a pattern of migration to old communities. The arrival of
immigrants in a new land had a similar cumulative effect, as those be¬
hind drew their friends after them. Canada probably benefited from
this magnetic effect before 1850 but after that date this advantage was


-----

increasingly felt by the United States and Australia. In this period,
indeed, Canada suffered from the cumulative momentum of her own
emigration to the United States.

Still other forces affected the flow of immigrants to Canada: the early
hostility of Britain's rulers to all emigration; their subsequent efforts to
keep emigration within the Empire; schemes for assisted emigration
and "colonization" and selling land; trade and lending policies; and, ulti¬
mately, the whole shape of development of metropolis and hinterland.
However, the purpose of this discussion is not to duplicate the efforts of
those who have studied migration itself, but to mark the relation of
migration to the Canadian labour market. To that end, the nature of the
various ethnic groups of immigrants who came to Canada is next con¬
sidered.

The English

English emigration to Canada, in contrast to Irish and Scottish emigra¬
tion, was unspectacular. English arrivals at Quebec numbered 5,000 to
10,000 in most years from 1825 to 1860 — a quarter or less of the total
immigrants in the first half of the century, and about half in the 1850s.
These numbers were especially tiny in proportion to the population of
the country from which the immigrants came, in contrast to the whole¬
sale movements from Scotland and Ireland. The pressures that produc¬
ed English emigration did not affect whole communities, but rather,
politically impotent and relatively inarticulate segments of society.
Moreover, the evidence indicates that the majority of the Englishmen
who arrived in Canada before 1850 proceeded on to the United States.
Those who remained were neither outstandingly good nor outstand¬
ingly bad in adjusting to their new environment.

The striking cultural and material differences in the nineteenth cen¬
###### tury between England and every other part of the British Isles except
the Scottish Lowlands could hardly fail to produce distinctive kinds of
emigration. There was, for one thing, the custom of inheritance by a
single heir, which applied to an extent to urban occupations as well as to
land, though apparently not to land in all parts of England.102 Then,
###### there were the immense structural changes of the Industrial Revolu¬
tion. They demanded an upheaval of English community life and custom,
and some groups suffered severely. But in England they also provided
great opportunities and great gains, and the prospect of a place of some
sort, eventually, for most of the losers. There was nothing like the
whiplash impact of these changes upon the marginal countries north
and west, where losses were universal, benefits imperceptible. In addi¬
tion, England had been an immensely richer, more diversified and more
developed country to start with. Its agriculture had been rationalized


-----

system, was inured to mobility and individual adjustment. Its cities
furnished the opportunities of a highly-developed commercial structure
along with the opportunities for submersion in their slums.

English emigrants, therefore, might be expected to carry a more
modern set of skills and attitudes than emigrants from peasant regions.
Yet not all the groups ground into emigration by the new order were
well-equipped. Younger members of aristocratic families, who brought
to the New World the presumption that the world owed them the social
and economic status of their ancestors, are sad examples. English pau¬
per immigrants, debilitated by the Speenhamland system, were in a
somewhat similar position. They emigrated without enthusiasm and
did not have or deserve a very favourable reputation in America. How¬
ever, it would be difficult to show that they did worse, in the end, than
###### other badly-equipped immigrant groups, the Highland Scots and Cath¬
olic Irish. Some thousands were sent to Canada under schemes for re¬
lieving the poor rates;103 but most English labourers, given their own
choice, determined that they would fare better elsewhere.

Better equipped, and more important, were English small farmers.
Perhaps they were thrust out, ultimately, by population growth,
primogeniture and structural changes in the economy, but they emig¬
rated in response to more immediate factors. The first wave, in 1816,
reflected the fall in agricultural prices at the end of the war, while costs
remained rigid and high. There was a second peak in the early 1830s,
###### when small farmers felt intensely the burden of poor rates, without
enjoying the power of the big farmer to profit at the other end from the
artificially low wages of parish labourers. A third wave developed from
###### about 1848, when farmers feared that the repeal of the Corn Laws
would ruin them. These farmers were valuable settlers, equipped with
industry, capital and skill. Generally, they were wise enough to avoid
pioneering, for which they were unequipped, and instead took over
developed farms which they managed well. Canada got some share of
these emigrants, particularly in the 1830s.104

The most numerous and important group of English emigrants were
industrial workers. Many were those cast out by the new factory system,
particularly hand-loom weavers. But it was characteristic even of the
expanding parts of the industrial machine to throw off groups of arti¬
sans and factory operatives from time to time. It is probable that an
###### important factor in the emigration of some of these elements was the
influx of Irish Catholics into Great Britain, which was especially large in
the second quarter of the nineteenth century. The Irish invasion did not
affect the entrenched crafts very greatly, but it put extreme pressure
upon exposed groups: factory workers, hand-loom weavers, dockers
and various types of semi-skilled urban labour, as well as on English and
Highland Scottish farm labourers Some feared that Irish migration to


-----

Britain would eventually lower the living standards of the whole British
working class to Irish levels. As it was, the Irish contributed directly and
indirectly a great part of the widespread distress in England before
1850, as well as fostering rapid industrial expansion by their contribu¬
tion of unlimited cheap labour.105 It is arguable, then, that many semi¬
skilled English workmen, and some skilled, fled to America essentially to
recapture the status which the Irish threatened at home. However, the
impact of all the unfavourable forces that beset industrial workers
depended primarily upon the state of industrial activity in England.
Workers emigrated in periods of unemployment or insecurity at home.
The course of industrial conflicts, and union support of emigration to
relieve the labour market, also played a part.106

Skilled and semi-skilled British workmen were distinguished from
###### other immigrant groups by their possession, in their hands and heads,
of the most advanced technology of the age. With their high investment
in industrial skill and their familiarity with urban life, they were rarely
attracted to agriculture in America. Even English weavers seem to have
clung to their craft, though Irish and Scottish weavers settled readily on
the land and did well there, probably because they had been quasi¬
farmers at home. The consequence of this preference of the English
industrial workers for their accustomed employments was that most of
them who came to Canada before 1850 found no adequate use for their
skills and went on to the cities of the United States. Even so, the power
to fill its limited wants from this large, trained pool of workmen was
very convenient for Canada. Then, in the 1850s, Canada experienced an
industrial revolution of its own, founded upon railroads. To man the
railroads, and the metal and other industries that appeared in con¬
nection with them, a very numerous group of English craftsmen
appeared and stayed. Several thousands of these workmen were im¬
ported for the purpose by railroad companies. This influx gave a new
industrial dimension to Canadian urban life in the 1850s, and a British
tone to urban craftsmanship tended to replace the earlier American one.
In later decades further movements of British artisans occurred in much
the same way, as Canada's industrial structure widened and deepened.107

Ancient migrations typically resulted in the immigrants (conquerors)
occupying the top of the succeeding social structure. But overseas lands
settled from Europe tended, after the original seizure of territories, to
demand immigrants at the bottom, subordinate labourers for the first-
comers. Such immigrants were provided first by the black and white
(indentured labour) slave trades; next by the outpouring of peasant,
especially Irish Catholic, labourers from northwest Europe; and finally,
by another peasant exodus from Mediterranean and Slavic Europe. So
effectively has the conception of the immigrant as a social and economic


-----

inferior been implanted by this historical experience, that a recent study
of British migration to America breathes constant surprise that British
immigrants entered American society at high social and economic
levels.108 But, in fact, British migration, and the whole Teutonic migra¬
tion, involved persons who took positions high on the social and eco¬
nomic scale in Canada and in other countries. Occasionally, Canadians
took exception to the unwarranted pretensions of newcomers, such as the
would-be gentry around Peterborough and the incompetent managers
of the Grand Trunk Railway. But, by and large, the immigrants were
accepted at their own high valuation because they had the cultural
equipment to support it. The immigrants were neither conquerors or
subordinates, but a reinforcement of the existing privileged classes,
readily assimilated into them. Racial homogeneity facilitated this assimi¬
lation, but the possession of scarce skills was the essential condition of
entry.109 The skilled English artisan, clerk, manager and professional
person were members of this favoured group.

It was implicit in the easy entry and complacent attitude of English
immigrants that they practised an exclusiveness based upon the status
systems of their new, and perhaps more their old, country. This exclu¬
siveness was occupational and social more than racial, its criteria consist¬
ing in occupational and social mores. English immigrants practised it
easily, perhaps unconsciously, because they refused to contest for em¬
ployment in which they did not enjoy a substantial advantage,.and they
were well-enough equipped that they did not have to do so. The con¬
sequence was that the English had little to do directly with ethnic con¬
flicts. On the other hand, they showed much less interest or adeptness
than the Scots, or even the Irish, in bridging ethnic gaps and working
out social compromises. Their enclaves instead provided an element of
aloof and somewhat arrogant stability.

English (and similar) artisans also contributed a new sort of stability
to the Canadian labour market from the 1850s. Unlike the native and
immigrant groups that entered the labour market on a temporary basis,
English artisans were committed to lifetime employment at their crafts.
Unlike the Irish Catholics and their own fathers of the 1830s, these men
made up a mature, disciplined labour force. They did not quarrel with
their employers over trifles, or indulge in battles, picturesque but use¬
less, that were really revolts against capitalism and employee status.
When conflicts did arise, they did not consider it essential to fight to the
last issue, but were constantly on watch for an acceptable settlement.
On the other hand, when these artisans were provoked to strike, they
conducted their campaign with far more discipline, solidarity and
staying-power than peasant-labourers could command.110 In general,
English immigrant craftsmen contributed very greatly to make Canada's


-----

labour market a modern one, by providing a regular and dependable
supply of skilled labour and by insisting as a counterpart upon a suitable
level of wages and conditions.111

The Scots

Overseas immigrants to Canada before 1815 were nearly all Scottish
Highlanders. The troubled state of outlying Scotland towards the end of
the eighteenth century, provision for military settlements, and the in¬
clination of a clannish people to join kinsmen who had preceded them,
all worked to make Scottish immigration preponderant. Nevertheless,
probably no more than 10,000 came before 1815.112

In post-war immigration, the number of Scots, though substantial,
always was less than the English and much below the Irish. On the
###### other hand, there is every indication that most Scots stayed in Canada,
instead of moving on to the United States as a great part of the English
and Irish did. Scotland's effective contribution to Canada, therefore,
was greater than immigration statistics would imply, and the number of
Scottish-born in Canada was as large as the English-born until after
1852. The size of the Scottish influx, its priority in time, and the Scot¬
tish talent for winning the confidence of other ethnic groups which did
not trust each other, all assisted to impose a Scottish character to Ca¬
nadian life that was the more striking because of the slight Scottish
influence in the United States.

Two very different groups were included in totals of Scottish immi¬
grants: peasant clansmen from the Isles and Highlands, children of an
ancient economic and social structure; and Lowlanders from a region as
advanced as any in the world. Highlanders seem to have predominated
as immigrants until about 1830, while it was mostly Lowlanders who
came in the 1850s and possibly in the preceding two decades as well.
However, there is no way to measure the sizes and dates of the re¬
spective contributions closely.

Highland emigration, like that of other peasant peoples, grew out of
crisis at home. The Highlands and Isles had preserved their clan system,
with its communal agriculture, into the eighteenth century. Analogous
###### arrangements had disappeared four centuries earlier in other parts of
Great Britain. The logic of the clan system was found in the provision of
manpower for war, and it measured success by the number of potential
warriors who could be supported by its subsistence agriculture. When
the system was broken by English conquest in 1745, capitalist ration¬
ality penetrated rapidly to erode traditional institutions and to establish
an order for which success depended on a minimum rather than a
maximum of population (labour cost). The population was now re¬
###### dundant and had to be cleared or occupied in profitable work. But cir¬


-----

growth, upon which there was no deliberate restraint, proceeded very
rapidly. It was facilitated by potato culture, which hid and accentuated
the problem. The rural linen industry had helped to support a great part
of the population, and under other conditions might have been the salva¬
tion of more, but it was put into retreat towards the end of the eight¬
eenth century by cotton, specialization and the factory system. New
industries suited to the population, fishing and kelp production, proved
to be unstable and incapable of supporting many. Other industries did
not appear; as in other such cases, the theoretical advantages of abun¬
dant cheap labour were more than offset by the dearth of skill, industrial
discipline and capital. From about 1760, there was widespread evidence
of overpopulation even in terms of the ancient economy, and the slight¬
est crop failure produced crisis. A final palliative was provided by the
Napoleonic Wars, with their opportunities for military employment,
the kind envisioned by the clan system. The British armies provided,
after their fashion, for an extraordinary number of Highlanders up to
1815. After that, there was nothing but social inertia to slow the renova¬
tion of the Highlands.113

There really was no solution to the Highland problem except emi¬
gration, and the Highlanders, in spite of their distaste for change and
removal, had seen that fact much earlier than the mercantilists in the
British government. The collapse of the clan system had the merit of
removing institutional obstacles to migration; indeed, some removals to
Canada were made in the vain hope of preserving clan life there. The
booming Scottish Lowlands seemed to be the obvious place for the
Highland surplus to go. The Highlanders could not meet the key de¬
mand in the Lowlands for skilled labour, but there were many jobs for
labourers in the cities and, seasonally, on the farms. A good many High¬
landers went in search of those jobs. But this outlet was obstructed,
especially after 1800, by the very large Irish emigration to Scotland.114
The Irish sought the same types of employment as the Highlanders,
could live just as hard as they and worked more efficiently. America,
where this pressure could be escaped, was the best destination for High¬
landers and, despite their poverty, a surprising number managed to get
there. Government assistance to military and (some) civilian settlers,
and contributions by the wealthy for reasons of benevolence or land
clearing, helped. The influence of those who assisted, patriotic and clan
sentiment, and later the pull of the timber trade, took a high proportion
of the emigrants to British North America.115

The Highlander, despite his hardiness, was badly prepared for life in
America. A peasant, he was untutored and undisciplined in the ways of
capitalistic communities. His frequent ignorance of the English lan¬
guage put him at a disadvantage with employers. Still more offensive
were his unwarranted pride and vanity. Selkirk, noting that a wage dif-


-----

ferential existed in favour of experienced men, said, " The newcomers
however (particularly the Highlanders) are apt to imagine that there
should be no difference and to expect the highest rate."™ Howison gave
a savagely unflattering picture of them and declared that Highlanders
soon became worse than any others for vanity.117 Presumably it was
these immigrants whom he said acquired “those absurd notions of in¬
dependence and equality" by the time they reached Kingston, where
they greeted those whom they met as equals, instead of uncovering as
they had at Montreal, for now they had become “gentelmen".118 Un¬
handy and uncooperative, the Highlander was a poor prospect for
employment.

However, the Highlander did not compete in the Canadian labour
market any more than he could help. Rather, he settled on a farm. His
success as a farmer was good by his own standards, bad by other
people's. Selkirk said of the Glengarry settlers that the young men be¬
came "as good as Americans" with the axe; but they did not get through
the work and stuck to the old ways.119 As for their housing, "These
accommodations appear poor to the Amer'ns and English settlers but
they are a wonderful advance from the hovels of Glengarry; and the
advance in cleanliness seems to keep pace with those of houses.. ."120
What the Highlander did was to pitch his agriculture at a level at which
efficiency and returns were low; but costs were low too, because he
would live on little, and so he survived.121 Though a marginal farmer,
he was reluctant to seek employment. When the Ottawa timber trade
expanded, the Highlander did take some part in it, but not the share he
might have had if he had been disposed to sacrifice leisure and inde¬
pendence for wages.

Very different were the emigrants from the Scottish Lowlands. Most
were small farmers and artisans, and they emigrated at much the same
times and for the same reasons as their English counterparts. Relative
to the population of Scotland, there were more of them. Emigration was
traditional with them, and probably economic pressures were sharper
than in England. While Lowland emigration resembled that from
England, there were some differences. Scottish farm labourers who
emigrated, unlike English parish labourers, tended to be efficient, enter¬
prising men, well prepared to become successful farmers in Canada.122
Scotland also contributed more merchants of various sorts, and proba¬
bly more professional men, than other countries. All these Lowland
emigrants possessed in a high degree the skills and attitudes suited to
a capitalist economy, and they were generally successful by capitalist
standards. They were distinguishable from the English by a readier ad¬
justability and a capacity and willingness to make themselves the bridge
among the other ethnic strains of the country.

###### proprietors, were withdrawn from and neutral to the labour market,
like most other elements in Canada. Some were substantial employers
and generally displayed the traditional ability to deal tactfully with
###### other ethnic elements, especially the French. Artisans were the most
notable section of Scottish wage earners, multiplying as industrial
employment expanded, especially in the 1850s, and contributing to pro¬
vide a class of mature, permanent, skilled workers to the Canadian
labour market. Scottish immigration also contributed labourers, de¬
pendable and capable from the Lowlands, inefficient and mercurial from
the Highlands; but both upon a transitory basis. It remained for other
ethnic elements to provide a permanent labouring class.

###### CHAPTER IV
 Population Growth and Migration: The Irish

The Irish

Irish emigration stands somewhat apart from all other migration. No
###### other country, in modern times, contributed to migration so persis¬
tently or in such an enormous proportion to its population. The sheer
volume of Irish emigration to America and to Great Britain would
make this movement a fact of capital importance. Yet, more signifi¬
cant is the role played by the Irish in their new environment, by reason
of their peculiar behaviour patterns, and the consequence for the
labour markets of other countries.

Ireland was for centuries an English colony, the one in which the
English learned the art of subjecting other peoples, and one in which
they practised a remarkable brutality. Irish economic development
was continually retarded by destructive wars and by legal disabilities
imposed by England. The native Irish, a primitive people, were sub¬
jected to social and economic conditions that prevented their de¬
veloping industrial skill of discipline and robbed them of morale and
enterprise. Ireland's population came to consist of two nations: the
native Roman Catholic Irish, and a Protestant body of Scottish, English
and Welsh origin. As landlords and officials, the Protestants were
spread through the island; but the significant element with respect to
industry and emigration was the Scottish settlement in Ulster. Ulster,
in the hands of these Scots, became by far the most prosperous part of
Ireland. The migration that produced the Irish Protestant nation was
the earliest British movement overseas, and a remarkably large one.
One estimate suggests that in the seventeenth century there were
as many as a quarter of a million Protestants in Ireland, as against a
million native Irish.1

The relations between the two Irish nations were complicated and
are easily misstated. There is a tendency in the literature of emigra¬
tion to treat the two Irelands as one, because they are not distinguished


-----

a great deal better off than their southern counterparts, and because
rish of either origin typically took labouring jobs upon their first ar¬
rival abroad. But there were differences between the two groups of
the greatest importance in skill and knowledge, and above all in morale.
Hence, Protestant and Catholic Irish pursued different goals in Amer¬
ica, differed in achievement and played different parts in social and
economic development. On the other hand, the difference in outlook
of the Irish nations, and the conflict between them, is sometimes
overdone. The Protestant Irish rapidly developed a loyalty to Ireland
and a hostility to English oppression that matched that of their Cath¬
olic neighbours. The Ulster Presbyterians were more chronically re¬
bellious than the Catholics. No Irish rebellion commanded the united
###### support of the factions — the more ardent the one, the more hesitant
the other because the objectives of the two parties were contradic¬
tory. The Protestants wanted to win independence from England and
to rule Ireland themselves; the Catholics wanted to be rid of all the
oppressors. Hence, England could rule by pitting one group against
the other. But, on the other hand, they were all Irishmen and retained
a certain consideration for each other at home and abroad. In Canada,
while Irish Protestants reacted strongly against truculent demon¬
###### strations by their Catholic countrymen, they were also ready on oc¬
casion to support, relieve and intercede for them. Nor do Canada's Pro¬
###### testant Irish appear ever to have wished to deny their origin, and the
phrase "Scotch-Irish" by which their kinsmen in the United States
have described themselves, appears to be strictly an American inven¬
tion in response to the "Native American" movement. As for the ten¬
sions that led in the twentieth century to the partition of Ireland, they
had not developed into irreconcilable religious and ethnic positions
at the time of the great Irish emigrations.

Irish population grew very rapidly in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. According to one careful student, there were about two and
a half million Irish in 1700 and four million by 1781.2 The censuses
###### reported six and three-quarter millions of Irish in 1821, seven and three-quarter millions in 1831 and eight and a quarter millions in
1841. Ulster shared in this expansion, but the special circumstances of
###### that province demand separate discussion. The forces that facilitated
population growth in the rest of Ireland do not seem to be in dispute.
The ancient customs of the country encouraged agricultural subdivi¬
sion, to which an alien administration added the complete insecurity of
annual leases. Until 1815, landlords found grain production profitable
and sought to turn their traditionally pastoral island into a land of til¬
lage. To grow grain, by the techniques of the day, required a large
labour supply; so landlords encouraged the peasantry to multiply by
the ready provision of scraps of land for cottages and potato patches.


-----

The means to support the growing population was, of course, the
potato, which had been widely depended on even in the seventeenth
###### century and which became the main and almost exclusive source of
food. About an acre of potatoes could support a family (as against ten
or more acres of cereals), leaving the rest of the land for grain produc¬
tion for the landlord's profit. The Irish, for their part, were encouraged
to marry young and multiply without restraint because there was
nothing to stop them — an Irish cottage represented the slightest in¬
vestment, and potato patches were easily got — and because there was
nothing to gain by delay. The peasant could be certain that he would
never be better off — for any gain would go to the landlord — and that
children represented the one chance for some security in old age.3
Some of the peasant's misery could have been relieved, it is true, if he
had been less inept, indolent and improvident; but tradition bound
him to a barbarous subsistence level of life, and the existing structure
could not have survived without it. In the same way, the inefficient
agricultural practices of Ireland were supported by ignorance and
inertia, and aggravated and perpetuated by short leases.

###### Contemporary England and Scotland provide evidence that a ra¬
pidly rising population, even if it outruns local food supplies, need not
produce starvation or retrogression. Abundant cheap labour has even
been regarded, with slight historical justification, as a great stimulator
of economic development. But to most of Ireland, as to the Scottish
Highlands, the Industrial Revolution brought only the destruction of
existing industries. There had, in fact, been several abortive efforts
to foster manufacturing in southern Ireland, and wars and economic
disabilities imposed from England were only part of the reason for
failure. The fundamental reason seems to have been that, while la¬
bour in general was redundant, skilful disciplined labour was extremely
scarce. It is instructive that the one part of Ireland in which industry
flourished, Ulster, had the highest wages, the highest living standards
and the least redundance of labour in Ireland, though labour was
cheap by English standards. But Ulster artisans were skilled and
industrious, so that labour costs were genuinely low there in the sense
###### that much was produced for each shilling of wages.4

The nature of southern Ireland, as of other peasant regions, led its
people to ignore signs of strain until monstrous imbalances produced
a general collapse. While the population continued to mount, land¬
lords discovered after 1815 that grass would pay better than grain.
The large population then appeared as a detriment, and landlords
wished to rid themselves of their cottagers. The increasing distress of
rural labourers was matched by that of artisans whose trades were
being destroyed by outside competition. The logical solution of emi¬


-----

tion from southern Ireland grew quickly. But the relief was not enough
to prevent further population growth, further subdivision of the land,
chronic unemployment and distress. In the end, it took the general
failure of the potato crop in 1845 and 1846 to induce a gigantic exodus
from Ireland, which permitted the emergence of a manageable econo¬
my sustained by a system of population control unique in the modern
world.5

The Ulstermen

English Protestant settlers in Ireland preferred the role of landlord
and, except for the Quakers, they contributed only modestly to emi¬
###### gration. Very different were the Scottish Presbyterians of Ulster.
They were small farmers or farmer-craftsmen. From the standpoint
of agricultural reformers, they were slovenly farmers; partly, no
doubt, because they devoted a great part of their time to the spinning
and weaving of linen. As pioneer immigrants, these Scots had to face
the hostility of the displaced native Irish. As Irishmen, they were con¬
fined by the legal prohibitions which England placed on Irish farming
and manufacturing. As Presbyterians, they suffered from attempts to
enforce conformity to the established church. Nevertheless, besides
carrying on their indifferent agriculture, these Scots made Ulster a
hive of linen manufacture (with the aid, possibly important, of Hugue¬
###### not immigrants) and of some lesser manufactures, and a thriving centre of commerce. In the nineteenth century, Belfast became a cotton manufacturing city; and later still, a centre for factory linen manufacture and shipbuilding.6

Farms in Ulster were typically held under an "Ulster custom" that
provided long leases, lower rents usually than the south and inheri¬
tance by a single heir, though subdivision occurred in the development
of the linen industry around farmer-craftsmen masters. It is doubtful
###### whether the Ulster custom is a sufficient explanation for the eco¬
nomic superiority of the north.7 But the necessity for non-inheriting
sons to carve out careers for themselves probably promoted manufac¬
###### turing as well as regular and orderly migration. Emigration was facili¬
tated by the fact that small farmers could realize considerable capital
from their improvements and unexpired leases. The periodic falling-in
of leases over wide areas appears also to have promoted general emi¬
###### gration movements.8 But emigration was linked most closely with
the fortunes of the linen industry. Bad times for linen weavers were
times of large migrations; good times cut the movement to a trickle. It
could be said that the high rate of population increase in Ulster was
###### prevented from leading to fragmentation in agriculture by a system of
single inheritance; was relieved by the growth of manufactures; and
was provided for ultimately by an orderly emigration to America


-----

Ulster emigration in the seventeenth century appears to have been
substantial for those times but irregular. In the eighteenth century,
the movement became a fairly regular one of possibly 5,000 persons a
year, which seems to have provided a greater part of America's im¬
migrants in that period. It has been argued that the early emigration
rested upon the desire of Presbyterians (and Quakers) to practise
their religion without molestation, and the demand for free religious
and political expression may have helped to establish the pattern of
movement. But the Ulster people, so recently immigrants to Ireland,
could hardly have had any objection to emigration in principle, and it is
clear that the great bulk of Ulster emigration was inspired by eco¬
nomic motives.

Until 1820, the typical Ulster emigrant (and the typical American
immigrant) was an indentured servant. His destination in America
was governed largely by the trade routes between Ireland and Amer¬
ica. The trade in flaxseed has been emphasized as promoting emigra¬
tion, and it took the Irish particularly to Philadelphia.9 But it seems
doubtful whether Ulster depended heavily upon American flaxseed
until about 1750: the volume of shipping involved could scarcely have
been large, and flax formed only one item in a set of quasi-barter trans¬
actions.10 Emigration as a by-product of the tobacco trade seems to
have been much more important.11 What may be said is that Ireland
carried on a lively commerce with America, exchanging linen and
some illegal woolens for tobacco, flax, sugar, cotton and other articles;
###### that the trade permitted Ulster emigrants to reach America; and that
it took them to ports from Philadelphia southward. But emigration
was no mechanical by-product of trade — Ireland had a number of
###### other trade connections that did not draw emigrants.

Opinions concerning the impact of Ulster migration upon America
vary enormously. A.C. Buchanan, who knew a great deal about emi¬
gration, and about Ulster emigration in particular, estimated that there
had been a million and a half emigrants to America up to 1828, of
whom at least a million had come from Ireland, and five-sixths of
these from Ulster.12 The American school of "Scotch-Irish" historians
similarly argue a large or preponderant Ulster immigration to the
United States in the eighteenth century.13 An opposing authority in¬
sists that the average annual Irish migration to the United States
before 1774 did not exceed 4,000 persons per year, and notes that the
American census of 1790 reported only 44,000 Irish-born in the United
States.14 Another cites, and apparently approves, a calculation that
only 6 per cent of the American white population was of "Scotch-Irish"
origin in 1790.15 If these figures were accepted, it would be difficult to
explain where the American population came from, or who, aside


-----

only to offer the general conclusion that Ulster provided a very sub¬
stantial portion of the people of the United States, especially of its south
and west. Perhaps Ulster's greatest contribution qualitatively, was
he American frontiersman and pioneer types, without which west¬
ward agricultural expansion would have been extremely difficult16
Since Ulster settlers had served a long apprenticeship in pioneering,
###### there was every reason why they should fulfil this role.17

Ulster made no significant contribution to the peopling of Canada
before 1815.18 But Ulster migration turned from southern to nor¬
###### thern ports of the United States after 1783,” probably because of the
collapse of the north British entrepot trade in tobacco.20 Then, after
1815, migration shifted still further north, to the St. Lawrence. The
convenience and low fares of the timber ships were mainly responsible
for this diversion, but it is also important that Ulstermen had develop¬
ed a new friendliness for the British connection,21 and that Upper
Canada was a mecca for landseekers until about 1835. Immigrants at
Quebec after 1815 were about 60 per cent Irish, and these overwhelm-
ingly from Ulster. That is, of the total immigration by way of the St.
Lawrence of 335,000 between 1816 and 1835, about 200,000 were
Irishmen, perhaps 170,000 of them from Ulster. It is likely that half or
more of these immigrants settled in the United States, but Irish im¬
###### migrants to Canada by way of New York may have offset a third of
this loss.

In Canada, as in the United States, the Ulsterman frequently sought
employment as a labourer following his arrival. Other British stocks
were inclined to regard him as beneath them for this reason, and
because his living standard was lower than theirs. On the other hand,
the Ulsterman was as determined as any to establish himself as an
###### independent farmer or artisan. He worked to accumulate funds for
this purpose and passed rather quickly out of the status of labourer.
When the Ulsterman acquired a farm, as most did, he progressed
well.22 Along with these small farmers came many really substantial
Irish farmers in the early 1830s, the years when "Edward Everett Hale
###### thought the Protestants (of Ireland) all went to Upper Canada", while
New England got the Catholics.23 The proportion of Ulstermen who
became merchants, professional men and artisans seems to have been
smaller than for the Lowland Scots and English. A great part of the
Ulster population had been trained to a trade, but the trade was weav¬
ing in most cases, and weaving had no more future in Canada than
elsewhere. In general, the Ulstermen merged readily into the com¬
###### munity of English-speaking peoples with which they shared a com¬
mon outlook and, soon, a common economic status. The Orange
###### Order, most notable of Irish Protestant institutions, was soon joined
by large numbers of Canadians of non-Irish origin Through it and


-----

otherwise, the Irish Protestants had a good deal to do with defeating
the Rebellion of 1837, and afterwards they took some share of the
Scottish burden of harmonizing the interests of various ethnic and
religious groups in Canada.24

Ulstermen made up the majority of workmen available for hire in
the 1820s and 1830s, and therefore were important for the labour
market of that time. However, they passed quickly into the society of
small independent farmers. Some were artisans, but Ulstermen were
###### neither numerous nor distinctive in this role. However, Ulster pro¬
vided the heavy labourers of America until the coming of the Irish
Catholics, as well as a vigorous strain of agricultural pioneers.

###### The Roman Catholic Irish

It has been claimed that the number of native Irish who abandoned
their conquered country in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
to become mercenaries in all the armies of Europe, reached hundreds
of thousands.25 Some additional thousands were sold by English con¬
querors as "slaves" to America.26 From the seventeenth century, if not
earlier, some Irish migrated to London and to English ports on the
west coast.27 There was also a movement of migratory Irish labourers
in search of seasonal employment in England, which was greatly en¬
larged when cheap steamship passages across the Irish Sea became
available in the 1820s. These Irish often settled down in Great Britain
to do the heavy work of the towns, to build canals and roads and to
man cotton mills. "Down to 1844-45 Britain was the main destination
of the surplus Irish, and in good times they were not unwelcome
there."28

Of long standing, also, was a regular movement of Irish to New¬
foundland in connection with the ancient trade of Waterford with
###### that island and as an incident to the provisioning of West of England
vessels.29 Some part of these Roman Catholic Irish moved on from
Newfoundland to Nova Scotia and New England.30 However, New
York attracted more around the beginning of the nineteenth century.
Selkirk found, in 1803-4, that "the Roman Catholic Church is very
###### numerous in New York — partly composed of French and Negroes
from St. Domingo, but the great majority Irish mostly arrived since
1798 — Dr. O'Brien the priest reckons his parishioners 15000 — viz
about Vi of the City — the Irish considerably more than half — a consid¬
erable proportion cannot speak English — there are also considerable
numbers spread thro' the Country New Jersey &c particularly at the
Iron works, and wherever any roads or public works are going on
— they are the principal dependence for ordinary labour in New
###### York.. ."31


-----

ence for the consensus of scholarly opinion that the native Irish were
###### not an emigrating people until the nineteenth century, that most Irish
districts had never been touched by emigration before that time, and
at emigration on a substantial scale can be dated from 18 18 32 There
were ample economic reasons for Catholic Irish emigration after 1815
an indeed, before that date. However, pressure was required to
break down home attachments and to establish a pattern of movement.
A precedent, like the Robinson settlement or a landlord's clearing
operation could set this pattern in a district, and a fairly regular exo¬
dus usually followed. Geographically, the custom of emigration spread
like a slow epidemic. It affected most of Munster long before Con¬
###### naught. The better-off and more industrious were more likely to go than others; partly it was poverty that held the Irish back, as it had held
the Catholic emigration behind the Protestants. Until the famine.
Catholic emigration was substantially less than Protestant in propor¬
tion to population. Only with the famine did emigration become a
mass flight, affecting all regions and classes.33

###### There can be no doubt, however, that Catholic Irish emigration to
America increased steadily in volume after 1815, or that the North
American timber trade played a vital role in this movement. Until
1816, passages to America cost about £10. With the rise of timber and
relaxation of passenger regulations, the fare to Quebec tumbled in
1817 and 1818 to remain about £2 per head, and often less, from 1820
to 1840. Moreover, Quebec ships took three children for one adult
fare, while New York ships did not. Catering to families worsened the
crowding aboard ship, but cheapness was vital for poor families, and
it was the poorest who most insisted on emigrating as family units.
Fares to all ports declined in the 1820s, but American ports could not
compete with timber ports for cheapness until the expansion of the
###### cotton trade in the 1830s. As has already been noted, emigrants actually
had the choice of three routes, differentiated by price and austerity.
The poorest Irish went to the Maritimes and thence to Boston.
Quebec drew the next and largest segment. The well-to-do paid twice
as much, or more, to go in comfort by way of New York.34

Buchanan surmised that a few Catholic Irish had entered Canada
before 1815 by way of Newfoundland, but the number must have
been insignificant.35 There were some Catholics, and an increasing
###### proportion of them, among the Irish immigrants at Quebec after
1815; but the ports of origin and Buchanan's comments suggest that
###### they did not exceed 10 per cent of Irish immigrants up to 1830.36 The
names of the labourers employed by the Lachine Canal Commission,
1820-24, to do the type of construction work that always proved at¬
tractive to Catholic Irish, indicate that most were Scots and Ulster¬
men but that a score or so of genuine native Irish were employed


-----

###### throughout these years.37 By 1826, however, a substantial number
of Irish Catholics seem to have been cared for by the Montreal Emi¬
gration Society.38 Irish Catholics certainly provided the bulk of the
thousands of labourers employed on the Rideau Canal, 1827-32, and
congregated in this period in Kingston, as well as in Quebec and
Montreal.39 They monopolized the public works' employment of the
Canadas from this time and penetrated Toronto in numbers in the
early 1830s. However, the fact that Irish Catholics congregated in cities
and on canals, whereas other groups disappeared into the back coun¬
###### try, gave them more attention than their numbers justified. There
may have been about 25,000 of them in Canada in the early 1830s. A
###### further 160,000 Irishmen entered Canada from 1836 to 1842, a larger
proportion than hitherto coming from the south. So far as the census¬
es permit an estimation, there seem to have been about 85,000 effect¬
ively Irish" (Irish Catholics and their Canadian-born offspring) in
1842-44.40 With the famine migration, the "effectively Irish" seem to
have increased to approximately 140,000 in 1848, 200,000 in 1852 and
280,000 in 1861. But by 1871 it does not seem that there could have
been more than 260,000 "effectively Irish" in Ontario and Quebec, if
so many.41 A decline is not unlikely, since immigration was slight after
1855, while the Catholic Irish pr<?bably migrated readily to the United
States.

The pattern of behaviour of Catholic Irish emigrants was surprising
and disturbing to those who received them. Since the Irish had been
peasants, it might have been supposed that they would settle on land
and aspire to small proprietorships like all preceding immigrants to
America. In fact, they showed almost no interest in farms. There are
a few instances of substantial numbers of Irish Catholics settling on
farms, and the settlers were moderately successful; but peculiar
compulsions were required to induce settlement. The Robinson set¬
tlers in Upper Canada were directed and bribed into settlement.42 A
considerable number of Irish labourers settled along the Chicago
Canal; but the reason they did so was that they had been paid for their
work in land script, could not obtain cash wages, and considered it
###### better to take land rather than nothing.43 Irish reluctance to settle on
the land has sometimes been put down to the lack of cordiality that
Catholics might expect from Protestant predecessors.44 The hazard
was real, but the explanation is not convincing. Catholic peasants who
really wanted to be farmers established themselves on the land in
America without noticeable difficulty. The Irish did not want to farm,
and some other immigrant peasant groups appeared later in America
with this same outlook.

Irish Catholics chose the city because of their preference in em¬


-----

###### merchants or artisans. Their enterprise was confined, in the first generation, to the operation of fourth-rate taverns and boarding
houses that catered, primarily, to succeeding Irish immigrants. Few
were craftsmen, and these few of an indifferent quality. What the
###### great majority of Irishmen sought was wage employment at labouring
jobs in the company of their fellows. Given these conditions, they
were willing enough to work in rural places and displayed a partiality
for public works construction in which they could capitalize on their
skill with spade and pick. In the cities, they took all the heaviest, most
###### dangerous and most unpleasant jobs, which frequently were the most
insecure and badly-paid ones. With their families, they crowded into
inferior tenements, made worse by their deficiences in respect to
sanitation and handiness.45

There was nothing accidental or peculiar to America in this beha¬
viour. Emigrants to England and Scotland, at every period, behaved in
exactly the same way. They took all the heavy rough work at what¬
ever wages they could get. They crowded into bad districts, provided a
###### disproportionate share of those requiring public relief, and forced the
beginnings of sanitary legislation upon the municipalities in which
###### they lived. They were intemperate and found no objection to public
exhibition of the fact. They disputed readily, and resorted to violence
easily. All this could be said equally of the Irish in both American and
Canadian cities.46

Explanations of Irish Catholic behaviour have not been very satis¬
factory, presumably because those who explained had a very different
outlook on life themselves and could not comprehend this behaviour.47
It has been said that the Irish clung to cities so that they could be
###### near their priests and churches; but this factor can easily be exagger¬
ated and misrepresented. The Irishman was superstitious rather than
religious; he ignored the advice of his priests when that did not suit
him; and his church was more a national than a religious institution.
Nor is there any reason why the Irish could not have enjoyed religious
services in rural communities, as others did, if they had wished to live
in rural communities. It has also been said, with more cause, that the
Irish chose the life they did because they were gregarious. But even
this is a superficial statement of the case. Irish love of company was not
simply an extreme manifestation of the compulsion that drives even
isolates to seek companions sometimes. Rather, the Irishman was a
primitive man, half a tribesman still.* In his experience, one man alone
could never win success or justice: only the group could do so. The
###### group was the one hope of security: there was no other. But neither is

*On this characterization, see Introduction, p. xxviii. Ed.


-----

this a reason for seeking the city. Irish gregariousness had been com¬
patible with rural life in Ireland.

The condition of Ireland suggests much sounder reasons for Irish be¬
haviour abroad. The Irishman eschewed agriculture precisely because
he knew a form of it that offered no attractions in his experience. Such
preferred employments as Ireland offered were in the cities in strongly
unionized fields.48 Proprietorship, in town or country, no doubt struck
the Irishman as a different and desirable status, but he hardly aspired
to it himself. It was beyond both his ambition and his wants. It required
a capacity for management and a capital, which he had no way to ac¬
quire. It implied a standard of life far higher than the one he was used
to. Above all, it implied a calculating individualist outlook, a divorce
from group life, which was difficult for the Irishman to assume. Another
generation, product of a different environment, would be emotionally
prepared for proprietorship; yet even they inclined to the small estab¬
lishment that yielded a living, rather than to the large one that promised
a profit. On the other hand, the Irish immigrant enjoyed advantages as
a labourer. He was strong, often industrious, willing to do the meanest
and hardest work, and excelled all others at digging. He was more
reasonable and manageable than the Highlander, more dependable
than the English pauper, stronger than the French-Canadian. Above
all, he was supremely available.

Dr. Dunlop declared that the Irish Catholic was "far the easiest con¬
ciliated of any emigrant", appreciating the relief in Canada from the
oppression of his home.49 There is evidence to support this view.50
However, when the Irish felt themselves victimized by employers or
governmental authorities — and they were victimized frequently — they
combined for resistance readily, like most eighteenth-century men,
and often struck back violently. Employers and officials were infuriat¬
ed by this behaviour. They wanted Irish labourers to accept "the law
of supply and demand" in economic matters — something no group
ever did willingly when it was to its disadvantage — and the regular
processes of law in allocating rights, as other groups more or less did.
But there was nothing in Irish experience to suggest that law, courts,
magistrates and troops had anything to do with assuring justice to the
poor: rather, they existed to oppress on behalf of the rich. Justice, so
far as there was any, was won by illegal combinations of men arrayed
against lawful authority. Irish experience in America served mainly to
confirm this view. However, the anarchical attitude of the Irish pro¬
duced endless distrust.

Still more offensive, probably, was the Irishman's way of living and
of handling himself. Earlier residents of America had developed a norm
of living enjoyed by many, sought by nearly all. It required fairly sub¬


-----

tous skills, a plain but plentiful diet and elementary care in handling
###### water supplies and sewage. The standard achieved was well above that
of the common man of Europe. The American common man also was
a harder, more versatile and, for his environment at least, a more
efficient worker than the European. The Irishman, on the other hand,
was far below the European standard both in living and working. It is
understandable that he should bring his standards to America with
him, but it is understandable also that he should earn contempt and
dislike by his primitiveness. The following description is of Irish la¬
bourers on the Rideau Canal in 1827 and 1828; but it would require
very little modification to serve as a description of the labourers7 life
on other public works, or even in the cities, during the succeeding
###### quarter century:

The common people of Ireland seem to me to be awkward and
unhandy. What they have been used to they can do very well; but
when put out of their old track, it is almost impossible to teach
them anything-It is a singular fact, too, with the Irish, that if
they can get a mud-cabin, they will never think of building one of
wood. At By-Town, on the Ottawa, they burrow into the sand hills;
smoke is seen to issue out of holes which are opened to answer the
purpose of chimneys. Here families contrive to pig together worse
even than in Ireland; and when any rows or such little things are
going on, the women are seen to pop their carroty polls out of the
humble doors, so dirty, sooty, smoke-dried, and ugly, that really
one cannot but be disgusted; and do what we will for their benefit,
we can obtain no alteration. If you build for them large and com¬
fortable houses, as was done at the place above-mentioned, so that
they might become useful labourers on the public works, still they
keep as decidedly filthy as before. You cannot get the low Irish to
wash their faces... you cannot get them to dress decently, al¬
###### though you supply them with ready-made clothes; they will smoke,
drink, eat murphies, brawl, box and set the house on fire about
their ears, even though you have a sentinel standing over with fixed
###### gun and bayonet to prevent it.... They absolutely die by the dozen, not of hunger, but of disease. They will not provide in summer
against the inclemencies of winter. Blankets and stockings they
will not purchase.... Surgical aid is not called in by them, until
###### matters get into the last stage. (In summer they drink) swamp

waters, if there be none nearer their habitations.

The Irish were also accident prone:

On the public works I was often extremely mortified to observe
the poor, ignorant, and careless creatures, running themselves


-----

into places where they either lost their lives, or got themselves so
###### hurt as to become useless ever after. Some of these, for instance,
would take jobs of quarrying from contractors, because they
###### thought there were good wages for this work, never thinking that
they did not understand the business. Of course, many of them
were blasted to pieces by their own shots, others killed by stones
falling on them... it is vain for overseers to warn them of their
danger, for they will pay no attention.... Even in their spade and
pickaxe work, the poor Irish receive dreadful accidents; as exca¬
vating in a wilderness is quite a different thing from doing that kind
of labour in a cleared country. Thus they have to pool in, as the
tactics of the art go —that is, dig in beneath the roots of trees,
which not infrequently fall down and smother them.51

An especially annoying old Irish custom was to pilfer through the
countryside for wood, or anything movable, in hard times and partic¬
ularly in winter.52 Winter unemployment nearly always reduced Irish
labourers in Canada to extreme distress, and it is not surprising that
they perpetuated the practice there, nor that gangs of labourers some¬
times took provisions forcibly from houses or taverns.53 But a popula¬
tion for whom property rights were sacred, conscious also of Irish
improvidence, found little excuse for these depredations.

In the cities, too, the Irish remained peasants. They crowded into
###### tenements or into shanties which they built on common or unused
ground. Their sanitary practices, suited to dispersed cottage life, in¬
vited epidemics. They were regularly dependent on charitable agencies
for survival. Their penetration of Toronto illustrates the difficulties
they raised for city and provincial governments. While the Irish Ca¬
tholic population of York was small, it appears to have constituted a
vigorous community, ready to imbibe democratic ideas from neigh¬
bours. It attempted to conduct its church in Presbyterian indepen¬
dence, as some communities in the United States had done before they
were borne down by the numbers of their kinsmen.54 Immigration soon
###### turned Toronto's Irish into religious conformists and social noncon¬
formists. Toronto had barely become Toronto when, in 1834, com¬
plaints were raised against squatters erecting "huts and shanties... in
the bank and on the beach in front of this City": "haunts of the idle
and worthless portion of the inhabitants".55 William Lyon Mackenzie
reported these shanties, and some other poor parts of the city, to
###### "throng with persons unlicensed selling beer, whiskey and other
strong liquors, and affording... room for Gambling and Vice in its
blackest shapes-I never saw anything in Europe to exceed the loath¬
some sights to be met with in Toronto ... "5o A list of the squatters, who
were reported to be increasing in numbers daily, makes clear that they

were Irish; though it suggests too that most of them were plain poor
people, perhaps selling a little unlicensed liquor for a living.57

Earlier, in 1831, Sir John Colborne had called attention to the
###### wretched condition of several" families in Toronto and proposed an enlargement of York Hospital, even at the risk of attracting the des¬ titute from other parts of the province.58 In the fall of 1831, the hos¬
pital reported. The admissions of this year as compared with the last
are more than double owing to the great influx of emigrants.... The
prevailing complaint among the Emigrants has been fever of the type
denominated Typhus. This disease engendered in poverty and wretch¬
edness has happily been heretofore almost unknown in the Country
###### ... 59 But the hospital was to be pressed still further by cholera epi¬
demics in 1832 and 1834.60 The problem of indigence, insofar as it was
distinguishable from ill-health, also outgrew the capacity of existing
charitable arrangements. At the beginning of 1837, a House of Indus¬
try was established in Toronto to overcome, among other things, "the
evils of street-begging".61 Though the House of Industry assisted only
those who were not able-bodied, calls upon it were very heavy from
the beginning. In the first year of operation, 1837, half those relieved
were Roman Catholics, and two-thirds (including Catholics) were
Irish.62 Irish Catholics also accounted for a disproportionate share of
convicts in the Provincial Penitentiary.63

But the rise of new welfare and regulatory policies induced by the
inflow of Irish Catholics, however important, was but a by-product of
a far more vital development of the Canadian labour market. Until the
Irish came, the market, though fairly well supplied with workmen for
###### permanent and semi-permanent jobs, lacked labour reserves. The im¬ migrant stream that flowed through the country after 1815 made it
easy for employers to find craftsmen for more or less permanent pos¬
itions and also to obtain labourers in season — the annual influx of
immigrants was well-timed to meet the peak of harvest work on the
farms. But there still was no permanent reserve of readily available
workmen. A great part of the immigrants who stayed in Canada dis¬
persed to settle, as potential proprietors, on farms. They often re¬
###### turned to the labour market to support their shaky proprietorships, but they did so at places and times dictated by their own locations and
the state of their own crops, rather than by market demand. Habitant
labour had the same qualified approach to the market. There were
some immigrants who responded more readily to demand, but these
were likely to be discouraged by the fitfulness and short duration of
calls on their services, and to proceed to the United States in the belief
###### that the labour market was more reliable there.

In Canada, a man with a young family cannot maintain his wife

and children in comfort upon the wages of agricultural labour,
unless he is in possession of a residence of his own; nor however
much the assistance of the labourer may be required at certain
seasons, can the farmer afford to give such constant employment,
as would enable the labourer to maintain a numerous family
###### throughout the year; — The poorer classes will not, if they can
avoid it, resume the conditions of the cottars, or small tenants .. .64

The problem of overcoming this impasse and establishing perma¬
###### nent labour reserves in Canada had two sides. It might be solved, on the
one hand, if demand for labour could be sufficiently consolidated so
###### that a body of labourers could be supported in conditions acceptable to
them. It might be solved, from another direction, by so narrowing
men's opportunities that they would be forced to become "cottars or
small tenants" whether they liked it or not. The privileged in Canada
leaned heavily to the second solution, arguing their case largely in
terms made notorious by Wakefield, whose ideas were very far from
being his exclusive property. It has already been noted that an attempt
was made in the 1830s to create a cottar class in Upper Canada, avail¬
able for hire by neighbouring employers, by locating poor immigrants
on five-acre lots.65 The policy of denying free grants of land that was
followed fairly consistently after 1831 also owed something to the de¬
sire to push poor men into a permanent labour reserve. As late as 1840,
a spokesman for privilege still felt required to argue:

The greatest drawback to the employment of Capital in this Coun¬
try at present consists in the high price of wages, and the extreme diffi¬
culty of procuring the labour requisite for its profitable employment in
any pursuit; and more especially in agricultural ones. Everything,
###### therefore, that tends to lessen the quantity of labor in the Market, will
also tend to exclude capital from it. But the main cause of the scar¬
city of hired labor in a new Country is the Cheapness of Land, and it
seems to follow, as an irresistible conclusion, that the Free gift of
Lands, must increase that scarcity an hundredfold .. .66

The right course, then, was to make land costly, so as to keep men in
the position of labourers, and force down wages. This would avoid a
community "composed exclusively of the occupiers of Free Grants —
and we can hardly picture to our imagination anything more deplor¬
able than the condition of a community so constituted."67 But it should
not be imagined that this was a policy of sacrificing the poor for the
sake of the rich. On the contrary, "the Interests of these two classes,
instead of being hostile and opposite, are connected together by so
firm and indissoluble a tie, that whatever depresses the Immigrant
Capitalist must at the same time injure the labouring Immigrant "68

A Wakefieldian program for Canada had to encounter at least two
great difficulties. The less formidable of them was that a great num¬
ber, and probably a majority, of Canada's residents did not want their
country overrun by capitalists and proletarians. They were partial,
indeed, as William Lyon Mackenzie had been in the 1820s, to the ob¬
jective of a versatile home-market economy that would free them
from their extreme dependence on export markets.69 But, when they
thought of creating manufactures, they probably pictured upstanding
free artisans rather than pale and brutalized factory operatives. They,
too, believed that the province should be a community of simple liv¬
ing, hard working, frugal, independent farmers served by honest mer¬
chants, craftsmen, small manufacturers, township schools, an honest
legislature, and a free press; in short an educated and largely agrarian
democracy. '70 Many would have agreed that:

###### ... great establishments of manufactures require great numbers
of very poor persons to do the work for small wages; that these
poor persons are to be found in Europe in large numbers, but that
they will not be found in North America until the lands are all
taken and cultivated, unless unnatural laws should be framed to
prevent the cultivator from being supplied from the cheapest
###### market... that every one who is able and willing to work may be
profitably employed in North America... (and it is to be hoped
that no pauper class will be created to disturb) the happy equality
which has hitherto prevailed in this country.71

This was not just Reform sentiment, either. R.B. Sullivan, who spoke
for the poor settlers of British extraction, was as decidedly conservative
as they. But, he found it no evil that in Canada "the only necessary in¬
equality of condition is, between the small and the great, the poor and
the wealthy land owner."72 And there seems to be more than dispas¬
sionate logic in his argument, that

###### ... the attempt to produce a greater inequality [by restrictions on
grants of land], founded upon reasoning applicable to other
Countries appears in theory, as it has been found in practice,
chimerical... the attempt to force upon a community like this the
universal relation of master and servant, of Capitalist and hired
labourer, must be vain; it may be successful in a new Country,
from whence the poor man cannot escape; — the trial is in vain
here; — but, it may be attended with the worst evil, which, in the
ordinary course of events can befall the Colony, namely, the re¬
tardment of its progress to the possession of a numerous popu¬
lation.73

Sullivan stated in the quotation above, as he stated many times, the

second and more serious obstacle to the creation of a reserve of cheap
labour in Canada: the natural forces operated against it. If men could
not get land in Canada, they would go instead to the United States.
Besides, there was not a regular enough demand in the Canadian
countryside to support labourers.

Oddly enough, while the case for creating a labour reserve by re¬
stricting the ownership of land was being debated back and forth, the
issue had already been settled. It was settled by the arrival in numbers
of Irish Catholic immigrants. Here was a class eager for wage em¬
ployment and immune to the lure of independent proprietorship.
Moreover, their wants were so meagre that they could somehow sur¬
vive— with a measure of public assistance — upon an assortment of
poorly paid jobs of doubtful duration. To be sure, even they could not
find enough work and assistance to sustain them in rural areas. But
the growing cities proved able to support them in some fashion, and
the very coming of the Irish increased the cities' power to do so. As the
number of Irish immigrants grew larger and larger in the twenty
years after 1830, labourers' wages, which had been pretty stable while
immigration was small, came tumbling down.74 As a consequence, in
the United States factory owners abandoned their air of benevolent
paternalism and replaced the cultured young ladies of Lowell with
cheap Irish immigrants.75 Canada did not have many factories in the
1840s, but the Irish did find a surprising amount of heavy and un¬
pleasant work to do in the towns, and they formed labour pools from
which factories might be supplied. By 1861, a writer could point to an
impressive list of mechanized industries in Toronto which, with the
aid of the "cheap labour which in a large city like Toronto can always
be commanded", were driving rural craftsmen out of business and
overpowering foreign competition as well.76 The same could have
been said of Montreal, Hamilton and perhaps Quebec.77

In spite of banker Allan,* men could not be barred from land in
Canada. Yet, in spite of Mackenzie and Sullivan, agrarian democracy
could not be preserved nor industrial capitalism held back. The Irish,
###### without consideration of any of them, had created the necessary labour
reserves to facilitate its growth. In doing so, they had fostered a regu¬
larity of demand for labour that made it increasingly deserving of a
###### permanent and ample supply, which might include less hardy strains of
labouring peoples. It is in this connection that one more thing ought
to be said of the Irish. Though they created Canada's reserve of unskil¬
led labour and made cheap labourers easily available in Canadian cities,
it was not altogether Irishmen on whom the industrialists of 1860

‘William Allan, first President of the Bank of Upper Canada, in 1821, was ap¬
pointed to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada in 1825, a member of the

depended. For, in their way, the Irish advanced rapidly in America.
They clung to the cities; but they had the perspicacity to concentrate
on the rapidly-growing cities. A second generation retained enough
of their heritage that they were still "effectively Irish", but they were
no longer peasants. Schooled in city life, they explored new avenues
of employment and dispersed among many occupations/ They ac¬
cepted at the same time an urban version of capitalistic progress, saved
to acquire a lot, built a house and put funds in savings banks.78 Saved
from too close a tie with their homeland by the inability of an exhausted
Ireland to send out many emigrants after the famine, the Irish in
America found new standards, new wants, a new morale and integra¬
tion into their new environment. The capitalistic labour market, which
it had been their dubious role to create, was to be in the last third of the
nineteenth century the habitat of French-Canadians, new immigrants
and the distressed of many races.

Ethnic Conflict in the Evolution of the Canadian Labour Market

What most clearly distinguishes the Canadian labour market from
many others is the way in which its shaping and development were
accomplished through the conflicts of ethnic groups. Some nations
entered the industrial age as ethnic units. The United States has had
sharp ethnic clashes, but has also possessed a dominant group which
has been able to impose a high degree of cultural and ideological con¬
formity upon minorities. Canada, in contrast, has remained a land of
ethnic diversity. Its main social pattern was determined by its early ex¬
perience as a bi-ethnic state, containing French-speaking people who
were nearly all Catholics, and English-speaking people who were
nearly all Protestants, with neither of them able to digest the other.
Most of French Canada, and some part of English Canada, have preten¬
ded ever since that Canada's population is still of this simple structure.
However, immigration produced an ethnically complicated Canadian
society early in the nineteenth century, and subsequent immigration
has offset cultural assimilation to keep it so.

In the labour market, differences in ethnic background between
employers and employed have often accentuated incomprehension
and hostility. Division of a work force into two or more ethnic groups
of different status has also been common and has encouraged employ¬
ers to seek bargaining advantage by exploiting the division. The divi¬
sion has sometimes been overcome, when wage earners have been per¬
suaded to sink their ethnic differences in favour of a common allegiance

to "the working class"; and the hostility which employers have usually
shown to doctrines of "working class unity" and to conceptions of class
in any proletarian sense, suggests that they have considered division
among their workmen to be of substantial advantage to themselves.
The more common experience in Canadian history, however, has been
of ethnic groups that stressed their ethnic unity and interest at the
expense of their class unity and interest in attempts to win advantages
at each others' expense. Superior status groups have done this by cul¬
tivating a narrow craft unionism, which frequently displayed energy
only in obstructing the organization of other workers, or by demon¬
strating their immunity to union appeals, counting upon suitable re¬
wards from employers. Groups of inferior status have followed com¬
parable policies. Successive inferior groups of immigrants have ac¬
cepted inferior working conditions, remained ostentatiously aloof from
unions and acted as strike-breakers, partly because the earlier en¬
trenched groups have been disposed to drive off newcomers or to
sacrifice their interests. Inferior groups, therefore, have ordinarily of¬
fered organized resistance to employers in their early years only where
they held a monopoly of employment, as the Irish did in public works'
construction. As new groups consolidated their positions and became
old groups, they were undermined in turn by new immigrants who de¬
pended upon their ethnic communities for whatever support they en¬
joyed.79

Divisions among workers (and employers) may be expressed in terms
of race, religion, language, nationality, regional origin, or whatever
offers an excuse for dividing. But the amalgams of these factors con¬
noted by ethnic distinctions provided the usual vehicle in Canada to
divide the whole and unify the parts. Neither residents nor immigrants,
in the early nineteenth century, had been subjected to forces that could
produce a deep national consciousness or class consciousness. What
most of them had, instead, was an ethnic consciousness of a tribal
nature and pre-capitalist origin. The more primitive they were, the
more they sought security in the identity with their ethnic community,
strength in its unity, and advancement by means of its power to sup¬
plant other groups. If the vehicle of the ethnic group had not existed,
a substitute would have had to be invented; for the peasantry of Scot¬
land, Ireland and Lower Canada were not conditioned to individualism,
and there is little room for individualism in the lives of wage earners.
However, the basis of division should not be mistaken for the cause of
division. That is found in the contest for economic advantage among
groups and classes. Combinations and unions often relied on ethnic
loyalties for their cohesion, but it was nevertheless the economic posi¬
tion of wage earners under capitalism that produced the unions, and
it was coincidental that ethnic forms were available for them.80


-----

Ethnic tensions can be found as early in the labour market as in
other spheres of Canadian life. They colour the relations between
high-handed English-speaking fur-traders and their canoemen. Strains
must have arisen after 1760 between English-speaking artisans who
assumed the role of first-class workmen, and French-speaking artisans
who were relegated to a second class. But such rivalries were evaded,
for the most part, by the device of a customary assignment of certain
employments to the French and others to the English. In any case,
there was a substantial geographical separation of French and English
communities, the labour market was small and most of the population
had little to do with it. Where ethnic intermixture in employment
nevertheless occurred, it did not have to produce rivalry so long as the
supply of labour did not outrun demand. The mixed body of working¬
men at Kingston appear to have maintained amicable relationships over
several decades.81

Immigration after 1815 intensified the fears of the French in Lower
Canada that the land which they had counted on for the settlement of
their future surpluses of population would all be seized by others. It
also undermined the position of the old settlers in Upper Canada,
where the immigrants ranged themselves on the side of British offi¬
cialdom, partly from their own conservatism,82 partly from fear and
jealousy of the old settlers.83 Ethnic rivalries were sharpened to some
extent by these developments. But the early immigrants — Scots,
English, Ulstermen and the vanguard of Irish Catholics — did not in¬
troduce serious strains into the labour market. Most of them moved on
quickly to settle as farmers or to pursue richer returns in the United
States. Artisans who stayed had found a place of employment. There
was room, without displacing anyone, for many thousands of labour¬
ers, because some tasks had gone undone for want of applicants and
because employment was expanding, particularly in timber and con¬
struction. In 1820, in 1827, even in the face of the enormous immi¬
gration of 1831, the opinion was expressed that the labour market was
not crowded and that there was no visible limit to the opportunities
for employment.84

It seems clear, however, that the absorptive capacity of Lower
Canada was exhausted early in the 1820s. A writer of 1820 declared
that Montreal offered openings for craftsmen, but did not hold out
the same promise for labourers, and assumed that sensible immi¬
grants would go elsewhere.85 Very shortly after, it was said that "the
hovels" of Quebec and Montreal "contained crowds of British emi¬
grants, who were struggling with those complicated horrors of poverty
and disease", too poor and too ignorant to go on to Upper Canada.86
Many immigrants did find work as "labourers on board Vessels, on the
rafts, wharves, and timber yards or are engaged as Servants in Que-

bee, and lay up a part of their earnings in the Savings Bank ... ",87 and
the city held "a profusion of Hibernian porters and knights of the
hod .. ."88 Efforts were made, with some success, to expand the oppor¬
tunities of Lower Canada by opening roads in the Townships.89 But
even in good years, the Quebec labour market was flooded long before
the peak of the immigrant season which denoted the arrival of the most
necessitous Irish.90 Those immigrants who escaped crowded hospitals
often lost their way in poor lodging houses so conducted as to be
"exceedingly favorable to the production and diffusion of Typhus
Fever".91 Though 1831 was a prosperous year, "the number of destitute
exceeded this year that of any former one", and 5,000 immigrants re¬
quired the help of the Quebec Emigrant Society.92 An emigrant guide
of 1833 wished "it to be distinctly understood by the labouring classes
of society, that there are already sufficient numbers in, and about
Quebec, and the lower province... "93 In 1844, it was remarked that
"generally throughout Western Canada these cases [winter unem¬
ployment of labourers] prevail to no great extent, and are usually
promptly and liberally relieved. At Quebec and Montreal, the first
landing points of emigration, and where the winters are much longer
and severer, the case is very different..."94 In 1850, "Quebec will be
found to contain loiterers and labourers, who will leave little employ¬
ment for newcomers. The mechanic, however, may find some work,
providing he will accept an engagement at reduced wages."95 During
the economic disturbances of the late 1840s, there was not work
enough even for the resident population, and the working classes of
Montreal and Quebec contributed substantially to emigraion to the
United States.96 In keeping with this chronic oversupply of labour,
wage rates in Lower Canada always were lower than those else¬
where.97 There was ample room here for contests over employment.

The very optimistic prospectuses for immigrants were based
###### throughout, in fact, upon the opportunities in Upper Canada. It was
continually pointed out how superior were the openings and wage
rates of that province.98 It did expand at a remarkable rate and often
showed an ability to absorb 20,000 or more immigrants in a year,
presumably because a large proportion of them, or of their predeces¬
sors, took up farms.99 But all was not plain sailing here, either. The
immigration associated with the construction of the Rideau Canal
produced, by 1827, a sharp lowering of labourers' wages in the eastern
###### part of the province and the appearance of a poverty-stricken urban
population in Kingston.100 Widespread distress in 1832 was blamed on
the reluctance of residents to hire immigrants for fear they were car¬
riers of cholera.101 Possibly 10,000 resident labourers were thrown
###### out of employment during the commercial crisis of 1837. The bulk of
them moved off sooner or later to seek employment in the United


-----

States, and immigration fell to a very low level in 1838 and 1839.102 In
consequence, labour was reported to be short in 1838, and it certainly
was so in 1839.io3 Employment expanded rapidly in the 1840s, but so
did overseas immigration, and there was an overland immigration of
several thousands of Irish labourers who fled to Canada because of
the suspension of construction work in the United States.104 Labour
was in surplus in Upper Canada from 1840 to 1843, and its cities held
###### destitute populations reminiscent of the lower province.105 The im¬
mense overseas immigration of 1847 was officially numbered at
90,000 persons, but probably was much larger. Coinciding with econ¬
omic recession, it was bound to produce overabundance of labour
everywhere. The relief burden and social inconveniences imposed by
it brought sharp and very widespread demands for limitations on
immigration.106 The labour market recovered by 1850, and the railway
boom that followed produced, in spite of a brisk inflow of immigrants,
an acute labour shortage by 1854. In that year, Buchanan said, "I have
never known such a season as this, and the universal complaint from
one end of the country to the other is the impossibility of securing la¬
###### bourers ... "107 But then the Canadian economy lost its buoyancy, and
immigration dropped off, in spite of efforts to encourage it by those
who imagined that immigration itself was the causal factor in prosper¬
ity. There continued to be ample supplies of labour in Upper Canada
###### without outside help.

It is apparent that many of the factors that contributed to the peri¬
odic clogging of the Canadian labour market were temporary ones. But
###### there were fundamental weaknesses also. Lower Canada had never
possessed a power to expand significantly. Immigrants were more and
more likely to be Irish Catholics who flocked to the unskilled labour
###### market rather than the land. The stresses of French-Canadian society
forced more and more of its members to seek wage employment from
the 1840s onward. These developments were supportable so long as
Upper Canada was resilient. But the sharp check felt in Upper Canada
###### after 1835, regarded at the time as a product of temporary factors, in
fact marked the permanent end of that soaring buoyancy which had
been based upon the attraction of good land. In the view of Hansen
and Brebner, "A state of congestion had resulted from the rapid devel¬
###### opment of land and resources", in contrast to the less cluttered attrac¬
tions of Iowa and Michigan in the 1830s and other states in succession
###### after them.108 The trouble was, in short, that "Canada had no Middle
West of her own";109 and this lack is of prime significance, regardless
of what exaggerations may have been committed in the name of the
###### frontier thesis. Its effect was that, while expansion continued in
Canada, and canals and railways provided an aura of prosperity during
###### their construction and a foundation for deeper development, Canada

could not match the new levels of vitality attained by the United States.
The commercial extractive economy had reached its limit, and a new
economic dimension was required. Agitation for industrialization was
general, and the labour supply required for it was available; but market
conditions were not very favourable and growth was slow. The labour
market remained generally crowded.

In the resulting competition among wage earners for a livelihood,
there must have been some rivalry among the old stocks and the sen¬
ior immigrants. Yet, they did not find it necessary to fall into open
conflict for employment. For artisans, the 1840s and 1850s offered a
rapid expansion of employment opportunities. The English-speaking,
in general, could seek a place in new settlements — in the United
States, if not in Canada. The French were hard pressed; but those who
became wage earners preferred the light industries of New England
to the heavy work at home. Neither they nor the senior English groups
seem to have crossed customary lines to take employment from each
other.

Most of the "burden of adjustment" seems to have fallen upon
the Irish Catholics. They were, in every sense, a marginal group. They
stood at the lowest level in skill and income, in the kind of work they
were offered and took, and in their standard of living.110 They were
Catholics, like the French, but they were excluded from French soc¬
iety by their failure to share its language and culture. Probably most of
the Irish spoke English, but they did not fit into the English-speaking
community because they were Catholics and because their behaviour
violated many social canons. Others were offended by their heavy
calls on relief agencies, their uninhibited traffic in liquor, a similarly
uninhibited use of knives and firearms, and strong-arm activities at
elections; though politicians often encouraged this last practice on their
own behalf. Employers and government officials professed exaspera¬
tion with Irish unwillingness to bow before "the laws of supply and
demand". The Irish were not property owners, and often they were
not fixed residents but migratory workers. They were therefore ex¬
cluded from the body politic by law and custom. The rejection of the
Irish by others, and Irish introversion and defiance, tended to intensify
each other. Migratory Irish workers were regarded as a third-class, dis¬
posable element of the population. "It is notorious that the great major¬
ity of the men who have been for some time engaged on public works,
become a class of migrating labourers, neither valuable as settlers, nor
disposed to fix themselves as such ... "m "The over-stock of labourers
(are) a floating mass from the States, who, when their services are no
longer required, or serviceable to the province will recross the lines."112

Yet the Irish felt as much compulsion as others to survive and


-----

English-speaking Protestants is an index of general antipathy; but the
way Orangeism flourished in English-speaking cities suggests a specific
conflict. It seems probable that city workingmen hoped through the
Orange Order to check the influx of Irish Catholics that weakened the
position of all wage earners, and particularly to oppose Irish Catholic
attempts to penetrate the artisan class. In this respect, therefore,
Orangeism is comparable to the "Native American" movement in the
United States.113

The major ethnic clash over employment, however, was between
the Irish and the French. Contemporary observers showed a curious
unwillingness to understand this hostility. Buchanan even denied that
it existed.114 McTaggart said that French-Canadian hatred for the
Irish (and the Yankees) seems rooted", but did not attempt seriously
to explain it.115 Another writer said that the French greatly disliked
the Irish, "for what reason I could not find out.. ,"116 Lord Durham
noted the competition for employment between French and Irish, but
did not "believe that the animosity which exists between the working
classes of the two origins is the necessary result of the collision of
interests." Rather, "The labourers, whom the emigration introduced,
contained a number of very ignorant, turbulent, and demoralized per¬
sons, whose conduct and manners alike revolted the well-ordered and
courteous natives of the same class."117 Such myopia was encouraged
by the fact that the French had not exploited very actively the em¬
ployments into which the Irish pushed. But the French regarded most
of these tasks as customarily their own, all the same, and they had
increasing need of them as outlets. Yet, until about 1860, the Irish
made the unskilled urban employment of Lower Canada pretty much
their private preserve. Only as they abandoned an economy in decline
were the French able to occupy the place which they thought to be
rightfully theirs.118

The French were the one group in Canada that the Irish felt they
could attack with impunity, not only in the labour market, but physi¬
cally. Superior in physique and aggressiveness, the Irish could and did
terrorize the French when it suited them. It suited them, among other
occasions, when there was acute competition for work in the Ottawa
timber trade, and on some public works in Lower Canada. On the pub¬
lic works, French were employed regularly as carters and woodcut¬
ters, but rarely as labourers. They evidently did not like this work, for
they responded poorly to offers of this employment, and contractors
preferred the hardier and more skilful Irish.119 Still, there are instances
of members of the two groups labouring together in peace. In such
cases, the French seem to have been readier to strike for higher wages
than the Irish; or perhaps the French took this way to end an unpleasant
experience, and the Irish hung back to be rid of their competitors. A

strike of this sort occurred at Beauharnois in 1843, which led to the
dismissal of the handful of French involved.120 There was a larger
strike the next year among labourers building the "Cascades Road". It is
interesting that in this case the French are supposed to have induced the
Irish to join their strike by threats of physical violence.121 But threats
and actual violence were typically levied the other way around. They
arose in the course of strikes by Irish labourers, when attempts were
made to enroll French-Canadians as strike-breakers. This recourse was
tried on the Beauharnois Canal in 1842.122 A "riot", evidently a fight
between the ethnic parties, ensued.123 The following spring, a similar
difficulty arose on the Lachine Canal, where the Irish were conducting a
long, bitter struggle against their employer. "A number of Canadians
who have been taken on the works since the last strike were, it is said,
assailed by a party of Irishmen with stones, &c., and driven off the
Canal. One man we hear received a severe blow on the head from a
missile, and all were so much intimidated as to render it unlikely they
will return."124

The way was prepared for strife in the timber trade by the construc¬
tion of the Rideau Canal, which brought hundreds of Irish labourers to
the Ottawa, and its completion, which left them without employment.
It was natural that many of the Irish should think of entering the ex¬
panding timber industry. They must have been inept woodsmen to start
with, but the haphazard method of granting timber limits in vogue pro¬
duced an opening for their talents:

These disturbances commenced by persons employing Men to cut
Timber [on Crown lands] getting into disputes as to their respec¬
tive boundaries; and there not being any person to appeal to for
settlement of such disputes, they have had recourse to hired bra-
voes and ruffians of the worst description, to intimidate the more
peaceably disposed, this mode of proceeding has been carried on for
about 3 years [i.e., since 1832, when most work ended on the Ri¬
deau Canal], which has been the means of introducing a number of
the worst Characters [Irish] into that part of the Country.. ,125

However, there evidently still was not room enough for all the Irish,
and that group felt its employment and wage rates to be threatened by
the more docile and proficient French, who had hitherto provided the
bulk of the employees on the river.

This year [1835] the disturbances have taken a different shape,
these bravoes and ruffians have headed & led on the whole mass of
Irish laborers, to drive the Canadian laborers from the lower pro¬
vince off the river, so that they might themselves be enabled to fix a
high Standard rate of wages. I am sorry to say, however contrary

this may be to the interests of those who employ men, yet some of
the employers have actually headed these disorders, without con¬
sidering the effect it would eventually have on their own business,
ut merely looking forward to the immediate gratification of some
Jealousy or pique [originating about boundaries] against other
employers having Canadian laborers .. ,126

The Irish raftsmen called themselves "Shiners".* One of their ob¬
jects, in which they had considerable success, was to win a closed shop
for their quasi-union organization — that is, to induce their employers
to hire none but Shiners. For several years, a species of civil war was
carried on along the Ottawa, and particularly at Bytown. It involved
not only the French and Irish raftsmen, but a "law and order" party that
enjoyed the support of Irish Protestant farmers. In the 1840s and 1850s,
Bytown's riots were mostly contests between Irish raftsmen and
Orangemen’)’, and mixtures of French and Irish shantymen could be
found on the same raft.127 However, it was considered the wise policy to
keep parties employed apart from each other whenever possible.128

Ethnic rivalries involving Irish Catholics, like others, declined only
slowly. But new conditions allowed the tensions to ease. The Irish won
a permanent place in a number of employments, which they tended to
make hereditary and customarily their own. The virtual cessation of
Irish emigration to Canada, and the continuation of Irish emigration
from Canada to the United States, prevented the necessity for the Irish
to strike out in new directions. Soon the settled body of Irish workmen,
if still suspect, were no longer "strangers" but citizens. On the other
hand, they never won the political power in Canada which they exer¬
cised in some states of the United States, perhaps because they were
too few and scattered to attain a strategic position; and therefore lacked
an opportunity to exasperate others from office. After 1855 it was
new groups of immigrants who successively entered Canada to pro¬
duce more, but different, ethnic tensions.129

A Note on the Orange Order in Canada

The progress of the Orange Order in Canada affords a useful sidelight
upon ethnic and class cleavages and the position of labour. The Order
first appeared formally in 1795-96 in the border region of Ulster. How¬
ever, societies like it, and activities and ceremonies of the sort it adopted.

had been carried on in Ireland for a long time before that.130 Orangeism
reflected the lower-middle-class position of the bulk of the Protestant
inhabitants of Ireland. They felt continually threatened from two sides:
by England and the Irish aristocracy above, and by the mass of Roman
Catholic peasantry below. The organizations by which such groups
express their resistance are typically ambivalent, sometimes taking on a
quasi-socialistic form when the upper millstone is regarded as the more
serious pressure, and again, a fascist form when the main attack is from
below. Orangeism in Ireland was primarily, but not exclusively, con¬
cerned with the threat from below. Pressure on the land, aggravated by
the social, political and legal inadequacies of Ireland, provoked the sys¬
tematic practice of mass violence in the eighteenth century and, still
more, in the nineteenth. Violence was ordinarily conducted through the
agency of secret societies, and its usual object was to acquire land, or
employment on land, by extra-legal means. Those with legal claims to
land, against whom the violence was directed, were usually (but not
always) Protestants. The attacked sought ways to resist, which in¬
cluded the organization of societies of their own.

A special aggravation, which produced the Orange Order, was the
push of land-hungry Catholics from the south of Ireland into Ulster.
The landless man would offer any rent for land. Moreover, the south¬
###### erner actually was able to pay a higher rent than the Ulster Protestant;
for though the Protestant was the more efficient farmer, he could not
match the Catholic's low and inexpensive standard of living. By tradi¬
tion, Ulster offered lower rents and greater security of tenure than
###### other parts of Ireland, and a preference for Protestant tenants. Land¬
lords were tempted, however, to reap the harvest of the Catholic influx
and to displace Protestants in favour of the newcomers. The very high
rate of Protestant emigration from Ulster was, in part, the reflection of
this displacement.131 But the appearance of resistance organizations
was another logical consequence. The Orange Order was produced
specifically by the physical battles that were a by-product of Catholic
immigration. However, it was bound to show hostility to southern
###### penetration of Ulster in general. It was also easy for the unity of Or¬
angeism, and of the things it opposed, to be expressed in religious terms.
Once established, the Order acquired a certain amount of independent
momentum as a fraternal and benevolent society.

While Orangeism was directed against Catholic competition for land,
and its symbolism provoked Irish Catholics by reminding them of the
most thorough of the conquests of Ireland, the Order was not simply an
anti-Catholic institution, as attacks upon it have commonly assumed.
William of Orange symbolized the British Crown, but he symbolized
still more the constitutional rights of the subject, including the right on


-----

constitution, which they did constantly, it was usually the rights of the
subject that they had in mind. This may explain why, though Orange¬
men stressed and demonstrated their extreme attachment to the British
connection, and were transferring their loyalty in the nineteenth cen¬
tury from Ireland to a loosely-defined community of free Britons,
Britain s rulers had an intense dislike for them. The rulers preferred
subjects who not only were loyal, but who were docile and asked no
questions. They were not very hopeful of finding these desired qualities
in any part of the population of Ireland, but thought they detected them
in the Roman Catholic population of Canada, which they therefore cul¬
tivated. This partiality, and efforts to suppress Orangeism, infuriated
Orangemen, conscious of their own superior devotion. This fact, and
different economic and political circumstances in Canada from those of
Ireland, led Canadian Orangeism into being directed more against
groups above the lower middle class than against those below it, and
resulted in some remarkable alliances between Orangemen and their
reputed enemies.

A conception of Orangeism seems to have been common in Canada
from the beginning of the nineteenth century. In 1804, Lord Selkirk had
great plans for settling Upper Canada with Roman Catholic Irish from
Nova Scotia, New York and Ireland. I mentioned the prejudice prevail¬
ing against Irish Settlers — he [Burke, Roman Catholic priest at Halifax]
said Hunter was free of them — frequently expressed his opinion that
the intolerance & oppression of the Orange men had occasioned the
disorders of the country... "132 It has been claimed that there were
Orangemen among the British troops in Canada during the 1812-1814
war and thereafter, and that Orange parades were held in Toronto in
1818, 1822 and 1824.133

The public records suggest that the first Orange Lodge in Canada was
established at Perth, in 1823 or 1824, under the leadership of Alexander
Matheson, who was then Deputy Sheriff of the Bathurst District.134
Matheson helped to set up several other lodges in this neighbourhood in
the next few years.133 A circular of 1826, addressed by James FitzGibbon
to the "Orangemen of Cavan and Perth", implied that they were the
only ones in Canada.136 The provincial authorities urged the Perth lodge
to disband in April 1827, on the ground that "these Associations are dis¬
continued at home and in every part of Canada except this District".137
However, the secretary replied that Orangeism was flourishing in
Ireland under a different name, and that in Canada "there are various
lodges in several parts of it with which we ourselves correspond".138
The Perth lodge bore, in fact, the number "7", and its persistent critic,
William Morris, noted another dimension of Orange growth in 1827
when he reported that "several members have lately joined it who have
no Connexion with Ireland" 139 By 1827 Orangemen were organized in


-----

Kingston, where a "riot" occurred on July 12 of that year.140 By 1830,
when the Lieutenant-Governor issued a circular to magistrates and
clergymen advising them against lending any countenance to Orange-
ism (the advice met a very mixed reception), the Order seems to have
been solidly entrenched from Kingston through Perth and beyond, and
in the part of Upper Canada east of this.141 It was ready for the skilful
hand of Ogle R. Gowan, who arrived from Ireland in 1829 and estab¬
lished a newspaper in Brockville. Gowan called a meeting in 1830, at¬
tended by representatives from Brockville, Montreal and Perth, which
set up a Grand Lodge of British North America. Official recognition of
this central authority was received from the parent body in 1832.142
Gowan became the first Grand Master and was to exercise enormous
influence in subsequent decades, usually as Grand Master, but some¬
times without the office. It is evident that membership in the Order
grew very rapidly. By 1833, it claimed 11,242 members.143 There are
supposed to have been 18,000 members in 1837, 20,000 in 1843 (after
some decline about 1840), 40,000 by 1846, about 80,000 in 1856 and
perhaps 100,000 in 1861.144 An ethnic-religious movement of this size
could obviously exert great influence. It is useful, therefore, to note
conditions that promoted the growth of Orangeism in Canada, and
the role that it played.

Though a student of Orangeism remarks that "it was only to be ex¬
pected that Orange Irishmen, possessing the depth of conviction that
their institution inspired, would set up branches of the Orange Order in
their new homes in Canada .. .",145 the significant fact is that the Order
was not at first perpetuated. On the contrary, wherever and so long as
conditions reminiscent of Ireland were absent, the Protestant Irish were
content to go on without this or any other distinctive organization. In
some parts of Canada, this phase lasted for several decades. Nor does
there appear to be any mystery concerning the stimulus of its growth.
Orangeism arose precisely at the time (1823-24) and the place (Perth
and its vicinity) that a large body of Irish Catholic settlers were deposit¬
ed.146 It emerged at Kingston exactly at the time that Irish Catholics
inundated that town. Its consolidation in the eastern part of the pro¬
vince, especially along the main river routes, reflected the permeation
of that area by Irish Catholics (to quite an extent the by-product of
canal construction). Its development at Peterborough, Port Hope and
Toronto is an index of the numbers and truculence of Irish Catholics.147

In keeping with this index, Orangeism scarcely made an appearance
in the western part of Upper Canada before 1835.148 It developed rather
slowly in the west in the 1840s and 1850s, attaining its full strength only
###### after 1855, and even then it was nothing like so strong as in the eastern
part of the province.149 In good part, the development of Orange strength

Clashes between them and the established population arose on various
grounds, and provoked a good deal of hostility. The effect was cumula¬
tive: the more construction workers, the more clashes, the more numer¬
ous and aggressive the Orange resistance movement; hence, still more
clashes, and so on.15° For the less sophisticated Orangemen— perhaps
for a majority at most times — keeping Irish Catholics in their place was
the main, or even sole, purpose of the Order. At the lowest level, there
was direct competition for employment. The motivation of the small
###### farmer who supported Orangeism is less obvious, but he certainly was
concerned to retain control of his social and governmental institutions
and to maintain the homogeneous population that made them function
smoothly. The Orange Order took particular pains to control as many
local offices as it could; and the less an office seeker was entitled to sup¬
###### port by his personal merits, the more likely was he to depend on an in¬
stitutional vehicle and maximize the threat of Popery.15* Finally, nearly
all levels of society were affected by physical clashes between Irish
Catholic workmen and others, which were sometimes the product of
drink, sometimes of poverty and sometimes of politics.

Yet, though antipathy for Irish Catholics in large numbers was the
predominant factor in the rise of Orangeism in Canada, it had little to do
with the role the Order played. The leaders of the Perth lodge as early as
1827, and Orange leaders on later occasions, insisted that they wished
only to live in friendship with Catholics.153 The leaders of the move¬
###### ment after 1830 directed their fire consistently against the upper rather than the lower levels of their opposition. Sometimes the objects of their
attack were the officials whom British governments had appointed.
Mostly, however, they were the entrenched, prosperous, smug "Ameri¬
cans . No love had been lost between these and the new, poorer overseas
settlers at any time. As the Reform party became increasingly radical
in the 1830s, the Orangemen set themselves solidly against the anti-
British Americans who, according to Gowan, "have carried with them
to this Province all their republican notions of 'liberty and equality'".153
The division thus reflected was, in part, a geographical one: Americans
were concentrated in the western part of the province and along the
###### front in the east. Overseas settlers were predominant in the eastern
back concessions where Orangeism was strongest. The Orange leader¬
ship set out with skill and no little spirit of sacrifice to confine and defeat
###### the American threat. That required a working arrangement with others
who shared a political loyalty, but little else, with Orangemen: Roman
Catholics and government officials. Already, in 1832, Gowan advised
###### the lodges to bow to the government's opposition to Orange proces¬
sions.154 In 1836, the Order, upon the request of the Lieutenant-
###### Governor and in view of "the already agitated state of the province".

agreed to dissolve itself altogether — formally, at least.155 These mea¬
sures facilitated an alliance with Roman Catholics in defence of the
British connection against the Reformers. "It is estimated that certainly
one third, and probably one half of the Reform defeats [in 1836] were
due to the alliance of the Orangemen under Gowan and the Roman
Catholics."156 In the Rebellion itself, the Orangemen were zealous,
though undiscriminating, defenders of the government. They provided
an extensive support, which the equally dependable Scottish Catholics
could not give, at a time when neither French-Canadians nor Americans
could be relied on, while the Irish Catholics adopted a policy of neutral¬
ity.157 The solid Orange-Catholic body, dominating the strategic bridge
between Kingston and Montreal, could have doomed a much more for¬
midable rebellion.

The extreme concessions which the Orange leadership was willing to
make were not very popular in the lower ranks, in 1836 or later. Nor did
local High Tories and British governors demonstrate much gratitude;
###### rather, they continued to try to suppress the Order.158 Perhaps this was fortunate for Canada, since it encouraged the Orangemen increasingly
to support moderate reform and responsible government. On the other
hand. Orange distrust of Reformers was heightened in the early 1840s
by violent attacks on the Order, culminating in the discriminatory
"Secret Societies Act" of 1843, which attempted to outlaw it. This, too,
was of profound importance. It consolidated Orange opinion and great¬
ly extended the influence of the Order. It recommended Gowan's policy
of building a moderate centre political bloc. It promoted, therefore, the
disintegration of the Reform movement and the consolidation of a
moderately conservative lower-middle-class interest which provided
the basis of Canada's governments for several decades. The key alliance
of this structure was the one between Orangemen and French Roman
Catholics. The emergence of that alliance may have been facilitated by
the fact that French Canada felt as much antipathy for Irish Catholics as
Orangemen did. However, the Orange leaders desired an accommo¬
dation with the Irish Catholic population also, and achieved it, though
it was less easy and stable than the arrangement with the French. The
basic alliance was not an easy one for the Orangemen to maintain either:
large portions of their membership were attracted regularly into the
Clear Grit camp by anti-Catholic appeals. As against this, Orangemen
and French-Canadians found a real bond of unity in demands for pro¬
tection. Protection was a very popular doctrine, with the additional
advantage that it tended to isolate the Clear Grit element of western
Canada and to neutralize its attractions. Though hardly ever free of
internal division, Orangeism was in the 1860s the mainstay of the gov¬
###### ernment and "the greatest power in the state".159 It thus underwrote


-----

The interplay of ethnic and class appeals revealed in the Orange record
serves to illustrate the nature of these loyalties. The ethnic and religious
alliances achieved are particularly illuminating, for they demonstrate
how persistently class interests triumphed over the divisive effects of
ethnic and religious differences and contributed to weld diverse ele¬
ments into a workable community. The capacity of Orangeism to attract
members of non-Irish origin emphasizes the same point. One thing
remains: the role of Orangeism in the towns and its relation to the
Canadian labour market.

Orangeism flourished, above all, in the towns. Kingston and Toronto
were its key centres, just as they were the key centres of the province;
but the Order was vigorous also in smaller places like London, Hamil¬
ton, Brockville and Cornwall.161 There was room in the towns, of
course, for a variety of rivalries. Local town government was a prize,
and the concentration of population invited vigorous contests for it. But
this does not explain why town organization should be dominated by
Orangeism rather than by political parties as such, or by religious de¬
nominations or trade unions. The answer seems to be that Orangeism
fused these various interests effectively and offered in particular a suit¬
able vehicle by which skilled workmen might advance their interest.

The type of town resident to which Orangeism appealed is indicated
from time to time. In Toronto s election riot of 1841, "the (Orange and
Green) Combatants seemed all low Irish and directed all their animosity
and blows at each other."162 Though the Orange Order, according to a
spokesman, grew rapidly about this time in "respectability" as well as in
numbers, enrolling the Mayor of Toronto and several Aldermen,163 an
###### informant of 1849 emphasized that the leaders of Toronto Orangeism
were still persons very low in the social scale.16* The "political transfor¬
mation" of William Henry Boulton, "a man popular with the labouring
classes" of Toronto, from a High Tory into an Orange spokesman, illus¬
###### trates both the nature and the strength of Orange suppoprt.165 After
one of the numerous clashes at Bytown between Orangemen and
Irish Catholic raftsmen, a correspondent wrote, "I regret to report that
the Rioters appear to be of the lower order — Roman Catholics and
###### Irish.. ,"166 The numerous Orangemen of Kingston who paraded in
1846 were described as "composed generally of labourers and others
.. ."167 The Order enjoyed, in fact, the support of a great many "respect¬
able" citizens — its opponents constantly complained of this fact; but it
seems clear that the great majority of its urban members were work¬
ingmen. Even this does not identify them exactly. The typical urban
###### Orangeman was a skilled worker, a craftsman.* This occupational and

class distinction came out in hearings that followed a "riot" in Kingston
on July 12, 1843. The Orange witnesses were carpenters, shoemakers,
tailors, carters. Their Irish Roman Catholic opponents, almost without
exception, were unskilled labourers.168 A further aspect of this rivalry
among wage earners is suggested in a memorial of February 1844 (part
of the active Roman Catholic campaign of that period to have Orange-
ism outlawed), from two Irish Roman Catholic shoemakers of Kingston.
The memorialists were members, they said, of "a private benevolent
society", which Orangemen mistakenly believed to be a "ribbon soc¬
iety. During their society's meeting in the Roman Catholic school, a
shot was fired into the room — by Orangemen, they surmised. It seems
probable that their surmise was correct, and that these men had incur¬
red particular dislike by entering the ranks of skilled workers, thus rais¬
ing in some minds the dreadful prospect that the whole skilled labour
market might be undermined by an influx of Irish Catholics.169

The fact that trade unions were rare phenomena in Canada until the
1850s, and not widely developed even then, may suggest that Canadian
workingmen of the early nineteenth century were powerless, terrified
or apathetic.* The truth seems to be that workmen advanced their
###### interests with considerable success, by other means. Irish Catholic
labourers used their ethnic community to organize their strikes and
promote their political interests. So, to an extent, did French workmen.
English-speaking Protestant craftsmen, to begin with, were often small
proprietors rather than employees. These scarcely had occasion to con¬
duct strikes, but they were great producers of petitions (especially in
Kingston) and had considerable success in limiting the competition of
convicts and imports. Artisans who worked for wages may often have
felt only a slight and temporary difference in status existing between
themselves and their employers. On the other hand, they shared with
employers an opposition of interest to the dominant commercial forces
of the country, which reflected British insistence that Canadians should
produce cheap raw materials rather than manufactured goods, and
considered labour a commodity to be made as cheap as possible. As the
industrial sector of the economy developed, artisans confined perma¬
nently to the status of wage earners organized unions, but their dif¬
ferences with their employers tended to be overshadowed for several
decades by a common interest in protection. Craftsmen, whether wage
earners or proprietors, had an interest in restricting competition in
the labour market, particularly in the skilled labour market. The posi-

*While unionism may have been rare in central Canada until the 1850s, it

tion and objectives of the artisans being what they were, it may be
doubted whether unions would have suited their wants very well, quite
aside from the question of legality, which was raised very rarely. Or¬
ganization along ethnic-religious lines through the Orange Order
would appear to have offered a number of advantages over organiza¬
tion through unions. Orangeism was oriented against yielding much
room to Irish Catholics — a position that would have been awkward
for a union, and a powerful recruiting point at a time when ethnic and
religious divisions were uppermost in men's minds. It also stood out
against excessive pretensions by the privileged classes, in the general
political sort of way that suited craftsmen, and united them before
economic development emphasized specific craft interests. Orangeism
provided numerous allies from the lower middle class: their outlook
was not yet very different from the craftsman's, and their numbers
yielded political power. The economic loyalty of the Orange Order
was decidedly local and it provided strong support for protection. For
all these reasons Orangeism, and the moderate political conservatism
which it built, represented the artisan well at a time when capitalism
had not advanced enough to subordinate all other divisions to the one
between capitalist and proletarian. In that time, the conservatism of
the workingman was a fixed point of.Canadian politics, and the Orange
###### Order was its typical form of organization. Lord Elgin reported in 1849 that Toronto was the most Tory place in Canada and had no fewer than twenty-five Orange lodges;170 but he could have found that other urban centres were much the same, for the same reasons.

###### CHAPTER V
 The Transformation of Canada's Economic Structure

The rapid advance of Canada's population in the first half of the nine¬
###### teenth century made possible the rise of a well-stocked and versatile
labour market capable of producing goods and services in variety and
volume and, at the same time, the local mass market required to con¬
sume them. But, while growth of population was a necessary condi¬
tion for industrial advance, it was not a sufficient condition. Mere
numbers do not assure progress — the persistence of many populous
areas of the world in a state of industrial stagnation for centuries
would rather suggest the contrary relationship. Neither does the
crossing of an ocean by a European population guarantee that an
industrial society will arise. Newfoundland and the Caribbean islands
are examples of overseas areas that were settled early by Europeans,
###### that have had growing populations, but are.in much the same economic
position and stage of development now as centuries ago. Until the nine¬
###### teenth century, Canada's position, as a producer of one or two staples
for overseas metropolitan markets, was parallel to that of Newfound¬
land and the West Indies; and it was not then obvious that Canada, but
not the others, was destined to escape.

Yet, a paramount fact about Canada is that it did develop a national
economy of an industrial type in the nineteenth century. The Canada
###### that existed until 1820 needs to be described, and has been very well
described, in terms of staple production — a language that is still
appropriate to the dependent outposts of the economic world. But this
language will not do to describe the Canada of 1870: what is required
for that is the terminology of advanced industrial societies. It is true
###### that Canada's transformation was not as rapid, nor as certain and de¬
cisive, as that of the United States. It is also true that the Canada of
1870 was a small and rather immature specimen of an industrial coun¬
try. Nevertheless, Canada's economic integration; its diminished de¬
pendence on a single export, or a single market, and on foreign trade


-----

intensive forms of production; the bustle and variety of activities of its
expanding cities: all these distinguish the 1870 economy from its staple-
producing predecessor of a half-century before.

The key to the new orientation was development of a home market
economy. The Canada of 1820 can barely be said to have had a home
market. Its main economic lines were transoceanic, providing for the
export of timber and fur and the import of liquor, cloth and hardware.
A majority of Canada s European inhabitants had scarcely any con¬
nection even with staple trade, but rather carried on a traditional
household and local economy which, while it did not amount to com¬
plete local self-sufficiency, involved only the most shadowy participa¬
tion in the Atlantic economy. Local self-sufficiency was encouraged,
even necessitated, by the absence of transport facilities capable of
drawing the back country into a national or world economy. The St.
Lawrence system of waterways was well suited to the gathering up of
a few raw materials that were exceptionally exportable, but it was
incapable of supporting a market economy for more than a few miles
inland from the waterfront. The waterway, in its natural state, also
restricted within very narrow limits the range of goods that could be
exchanged advantageously up and down the system. While these cir¬
cumstances persisted, the Canadian provinces did not become a co¬
###### herent market in their own right, but remained as a series of economic fragments united only by a common dependence upon Great Britain.

An essential step in changing this orientation was the construction
of canals, railways and roads, particularly the trunk water and rail
lines built in the 1840s and 1850s. All these, except some local roads,
had been intended to foster the export of raw materials; but their
main effect was quite the opposite: to create an integrated Canadian
economy that turned away from the ocean, and to strengthen it with
the active participation of the backwoods masses who, until the pene¬
###### tration of the railroad, had had little connection with any market.1 The new Canadian economy of the 1850s exported wheat and flour rather than fur, more lumber and ships and less timber, and its imports con¬
sisted more of capital and less of consumer goods. These changes were
the fruit, in part, of the discovery of a second major trading partner —
###### the United States. The really vital development, however, was the trend away from foreign trade to home supply, including the supply of manufactured goods, that the newly-created home market fostered.
 There is not much quantitative evidence that can be presented of this
change, but the accompanying table showing the occupational distribu¬
tion of the Canadian people in the second half of the nineteenth century
serves, at least, to indicate the direction of development. These data
show, for one thing, the preponderant place occupied by agriculture in
this period — a preponderance which in the view of this study was

a necessary condition to shift the weight of the economy away from
t e gathering of surface products, and to provide the base required
or manufactures. They show the considerable expansion of com¬
mercial, transportation and professional activities that occurred. They
show a marked decline of domestic services and, finally, though this
###### trend is the least emphatic, the correlative expansion of industrial activ¬
ity, proportionally as well as absolutely. If satisfactory statistics were
available for the 1830s and 1840s, it is thought that the same trends
would be demonstrated also for the earlier period, and that the growth
of industrial occupations would be more pronounced.

Some quantitative evidence is also available to show the growth of
###### towns and cities — a growth so vigorous as to suggest that the urban part of Canada's population was gaining on the rural in the nineteenth century, in spite of the expansion of agriculture.3 Some of the most
striking urban advances occurred in the 1830s and 1840s: Kingston
more than tripled its population between 1829 and 1851; Hamilton
multiplied nine times between 1835 and 1853; and Toronto, which
was to be chief beneficiary of the integrated Canadian economy,
increased four and a half times between 1830 and 1851. Some urban
centres, dependent on the transatlantic trade in staples, stagnated
###### with growth of the home market. Quebec was only able to double its
population between 1830 and 1870, whereas the total population of
###### the Canadas multiplied nearly four times in that period. Kingston
remained almost stationary in population for a long time after 1851,
while Three Rivers and Sorel, perhaps representative of most centres
of the lower province, barely managed to keep pace with the general
###### growth of population between 1851 and 1871. However, there were
many places that fared much better. One was Montreal, which had
###### grown more slowly than the total population of the Canadas in the
1830s and 1840s (by about 15 per cent), but which managed to get a
firm footing in the home market economy as well as the export
economy after 1850. Aided by railways and manufactures, Montreal
###### grew about 20 per cent faster than the total population between 1851
and 1871, almost doubling its population in that period. Toronto, which
had enjoyed spectacular growth before 1850, also grew about 20 per
cent faster than the total population between 1851 and 1871. The cen¬
###### tres that experienced the most striking growth after 1851, however, were the towns and smaller cities of Upper Canada. Nine of these3 (other than places already mentioned) grew more than 50 per cent faster between 1851 and 1871, on average, than the general population.

It appears that cities, especially in "underdeveloped" countries, may
###### often be mere agglomerations of people, producing only an indistinct
and inadequate volume of services.4 Even these may provide some
###### foundation for a mass market Canada's cities of the nineteenth cen


-----

###### tury did this but, fortunately, also possessed firm foundations in trans¬
port lines, while the places that grew fastest were industrial cities
producing flour and beer, shoes and clothing, sewing machines and
farm machines, locomotives and sleeping cars.5 It is, indeed, a new
###### nature and feel of these cities that demonstrates, more clearly than sta¬
tistics, the appearance of a new level of economy. It is true that cotton
mills, the vehicle of industrial capitalism in Great Britain, did poorly
in Canada, though some were attempted in the 1840s and 1850s. But
railways stimulated the manufacture of iron products, so that in the
1850s Toronto and Montreal and some smaller centres produced loco¬
motives and possessed rolling mills, some of them impressive. In that
decade, rubber manufacture and large-scale sugar refining also were
inaugurated in Montreal. The Hamilton of the 1850s was an unusually
versatile manufacturing centre, turning out foundry products, locomo¬
tives, railway cars, sewing machines, ready-made clothing and tobac¬
co.*6 By 1860, cities generally were supplying the country with shoes,
clothing, beer, whisky, furniture, with the aid of power and machinery
and at the expense of domestic handicrafts, village artisans and foreign
manufacturers. Still the most telling sign of a new atmosphere in
Canada was not the volume of physical output itself, but the accom¬
panying emphasis on progress and efficiency, education, science and
mechanical invention. The cities with their schools and Mechanics'
###### Institutes, scientific lectures and uplift societies, were the guardians
and disseminators of that emphasis.

Canadian farmers of the nineteenth century tended to be suspicious
of export markets and conscious of the security of the home market
which many of them had always enjoyed and which expanding cities
could more fully provide. Nevertheless the cities, by their nature, had
to be the most urgent supporters of the national economy. To be sure,
they still contained the agents of transatlantic commerce among their
populations. But, in the last half of the century, their trade policy was
not determined by these but by the far larger numbers who operated
the transport systems, effected the exchanges and produced the
###### manufactures required by the national economy. The cities represent¬
ed an enormous investment in improved real estate and machinery,
in streets and docks, in waterworks and gasworks, and in a versatile
labour force, largely predicated upon the permanence and growth of
the home market. Vulnerable and therefore sensitive, the cities were
keenly conscious that the exchange of city manufactures for country
produce was the core of their prosperity. They prized the security of

rather than an industrial city. See Michael Katz, The People of Hamilton, Canada


-----

local exchange, not least because of rough lessons in the unreliability
of foreign markets, and they were hostile to any who would disrupt it.
The cities own capacity to consume and produce, and the political
###### strength which their concentration and organization permitted,
provided powerful weapons to defend their interest.

But, while the vested interests of a national economy are obvious
guardians of its survival and expansion, that provides no explanation
of how the economy or the interests arose in the first place. It has been
pointed out that population increase, similarly, can explain how the
###### transformation of an economy was facilitated, but not how it was ef¬
fected. Passing reference has been made to new transport media and
to agricultural expansion as important elements in Canada's evolution;
but their role has not been explored. The great question remains:
How was Canada's transition from a staple-producing outpost to an
###### integrated economy brought about? The remainder of this chapter is
intended to answer the question so far as the evolution of economic
###### structure is concerned. Changes in attitudes and industrial organiza¬
tion, which are also involved in the answer, will be discussed subse¬
quently.

###### The Physical Possibility of Canadian Development

The voluminous literature of economic development that has appear¬
ed in recent years, with particular reference to the "underdeveloped"
countries of the world, appears to be based in many instances upon
some questionable assumptions. One is that all countries (and all
regions?) are destined to develop economically — that is, to become
diversified economies replete with the manufactures, trade, finance
and urbanization that characterize "advanced" countries. A second
assumption is that the evolution of underdeveloped countries must
proceed by much the same stages as those experienced by the coun¬
tries of Europe and North America. It is perhaps natural that these
assumptions should be made by many experts on economic develop¬
###### ment, who are drawn almost invariably from developed countries, and
reflect their common ideas. These assumptions are implicit, too, in the
writings of those who, since the days of Comte, Roscher and List,
have postulated stages of economic development. Since these writers
have had specific developing countries in mind in drawing up their
stages, and since the countries now "developed" have followed a rea¬
sonably uniform pattern, the stages supposed by various writers usual¬
ly turn out to be similar to each other. Indeed, a conception of stages of
development is desirable, if not essential, when undertaking a discus¬
sion of national development such as the present one. The conception
of development used as a starting point here is one proposed by Pro¬


-----

generality and freedom of mysticism.7 Clark has proposed that ad¬
vanced countries have progressed, typically, through three broad
stages of development. The first is a stage of extractive industry (in¬
cluding agriculture). In the second stage, emphasis is on manufactur¬
ing. In the third stage there is a relative decline in the production of
commodities as more and more of the economy becomes devoted to
"service" activities. The experience of most countries inhabited by
Europeans, including Canada, can be fitted readily into these stages.
The comfortable conclusion from this experience that may be convey¬
ed to underdeveloped countries is that all will go well with their devel¬
opment if they will only make themselves, to start with, proficient
producers of raw materials.

The view that all countries will proceed neatly from extractive
industry to manufactures, and then to an advanced economy of ser¬
vices, is open to at least two serious criticisms, both relevant to
Canadian experience. One is that the process by which countries have
shifted from raw material production to manufacturing is an obscure
one; that the trading partners of raw material producers have usually
tried to prevent this shift from taking place; and that, therefore, the
change is not effortlessly inevitable, but rather requires unusual cir¬
cumstances or exceptional national determination, or both. This
point, as it bears on Canada, is discussed in subsequent sections. A
second criticism is that, in fact, all countries have not had a uniform
history of development. On the contrary, physical characteristics and
limitations have produced diversity even among areas populated by
Europeans. This point is pursued below.

To begin with, some countries and regions have scarcely had a raw
material stage. They attracted settlement, failed to develop any satis¬
factory raw material to export, yet flourished by exploiting commer¬
cial opportunities. The Netherlands, New England and Nova Scotia
have followed this pattern.8 At the opposite extreme are territories
###### that never have had, and probably never will have, anything but a raw
material stage. In their case, the question is not whether they will go
beyond raw materials, but whether they will support staple produc¬
tion permanently. A territory whose known resources can be easily
snatched may be discarded after a superficial looting, as the Yukon
was. Other areas have an endowment that, though narrow, is per¬
###### manent and therefore capable of the indefinite support of a population
engaged in extractive pursuits. Iceland and Newfoundland, are in this
category. Canada's Pre-Cambrian Shield lies somewhere between
these types, with resources that are exhaustible, but not readily ex¬
hausted. The limited physical capacities of territories of these kinds
dooms them always to be dependent, economically and politically,


-----

Between the extremes of the countries that never found an expor¬
table staple, and the countries that must always be raw material pro¬
ducers, are the countries that have managed, or may yet hope, to shift
from raw material production to manufactures and maturity. Though
these countries vary considerably in their natures, they have a com¬
mon element: good land capable of supporting a surplus-producing
agriculture. This proposition does not rest upon a mystique of Physi¬
ocracy (though that is a kind of evidence, too) but upon history and
logic.

The historical evidence, though it cannot be conclusive by its na¬
###### ture, establishes a strong prime facie case. Every country that has be¬
come industrialized possessed the base of a strong agriculture. The
countries that have changed most have had the richest farmlands
from long ago, and, in the cases of Britain and Japan, which perhaps
had the richest farms of all, have come to rely the most on foreign food
supplies. Countries that never had a strong agriculture have failed to
become important industrially (though it is arguable that Switzerland
is an exception). This is not to deny the importance in the history of
development of coal, iron, location, wars and institutions. What is
most remarkable is that, even when allowance is made for the many
###### other pertinent factors, there remains so high a correlation between
agricultural efficiency and industrial advance.*10

Beyond the empirical evidence, there is a logical explanation why
only countries with a strong agriculture should succeed to manufac¬
###### tures. Agriculture is profoundly different from any of the other
primary, easily-undertaken industries that mark the extractive stage
of an economy. Agriculture is the activity most able to attract large-
scale settlement — and that without any necessary reference to out¬
side markets. It is, similarly, the one primary industry able to support
a large population indefinitely, irrespective of the stage of foreign
markets. When export markets collapse, mineral economies and tim¬
ber economies and even fish economies cannot survive upon their
own produce: producers are faced with the unpleasant alternatives of
###### starvation or flight. Agricultural economies, on the other hand, can ensure at least that their population will have the elementary means
of life; and closing of their export markets, if the inhabitants are not
paralyzed by custom or confusion or outside control, may hasten the
development of a diversified economy. An agricultural population.

*Cf. John Isbister's contention that after 1850 "Quebec's industrial sector was
able to develop at a relatively rapid rate without the support of a dynamic agri¬
cultural sector." "Agriculture, Balanced Growth, and Social Change in Cen¬
tral Canada since 1850: An Interpretation", Economic Development and Cultural
Change, July 1977, p. 263. Ed.

characteristically dense until the present century, is an obvious and
###### permanent market for manufactures, in which the local manufacturer
enjoys the advantage of cheap food supply and protection against out¬
side producers to the extent of transport costs, at least. However, the
agricultural economy that has lost markets or lacks them would seem
to be much inferior, as a foundation for manufactures, to the one
whose rich soil has permitted the successful expansion of export
trade. A population used to maximizing production and surpluses
over local needs is likely to exchange, and consume also, at a high level.
The attitudes and institutions that flourish in an agricultural econ¬
omy that is efficient in the capitalistic sense are well suited to produce
successful industrial managers and workers. A flourishing export
trade invites the transport media that bind the regions they penetrate
into a coherent national economy.* The surpluses of a prosperous and
###### market-oriented agriculture are likely to be one important source of
the capital required for industrial development. In several respects,
###### then — as a market, as a source of labour and capital, as a coherent
economy whose permanence seems certain — a surplus-producing
agriculture offers superior conditions for industrialization. When
###### manufactures do become established within agricultural economies,
they enhance their own economic justification by providing markets
for farm produce that are more diversified, more remunerative and
more secure than the export market. There are good reasons, then,
why manufactures have flourished on the world's flat plainlands,
whereas they have entered only reluctantly, and usually as tentacles
of a plainland economy, the areas of impoverished soil, desert, forest
and mountain. Among recently settled countries, the United States
possessed such rich agricultural resources, and these hardly broken
from the seaboard to the Rockies, that only monumental misman¬
agement could have prevented its rapid industrialization. Canada, on
the other hand, has been a marginal case, whose title to intensive devel¬
opment has been kept tenuous by the limitations of its agriculture.

With expansion of European settlement inland from Quebec, Canada
has had three chances to acquire a strong agricultural base. These
came, successively, with settlement of the Montreal region, of western
Upper Canada and of the western prairies. The last of these opportu¬
nities needs no extended discussion: prairie settlement gave substantial
support for economic diversification after 1900, but the foundations

‘However, it can be noted that a new transportation system can reduce the
natural protection of transport costs and thereby destroy existing small-scale
manufacturing in agricultural areas. See J.M. Gilmour, Spacial Evolution of
Manufacturing: Southern Ontario, 1851-7891 (Toronto: University of Toronto

for this had already been firmly established with the aid of the earlier
agricultural bases. The key question, how the original development of
a Canadian national economy was accomplished, concerns the earlier
waves of settlement.

As an agricultural base, the Montreal region was limited in area,
while its soil and climate were less advantageous than those found in
many other parts of the world. Nevertheless, it proved to be more
###### than adequate for the limited population of the eighteenth century.
Not only was it the bread basket of the country for more than a cen¬
###### tury, but it demonstrated a power to make modest surpluses of wheat
and other products available whenever there was any prospect of ex¬
###### porting them. It is not true, either, that agriculture was a minor
element in the economy of New France, in spite of the contrary im¬
pression that preoccupation with the fur trade might produce. It was
claimed from time to time during the French regime that too many
men were being drawn into the fur trade to the detriment of agricul¬
###### ture, and some very high estimates have been given of the number thus affected. However, it seems doubtful that more than 15 per cent
of Canada's labour force was ever involved in the fur trade.11 Other
extractive pursuits, fishing and lumbering, did not take many men, or
these for very long. New France was primarily an agricultural colony in
which farming was the main occupation and support of the people.1?
Moreover, the colony's agriculture supported in the town and village
crafts, the local mills, the ironworks and the shipyards, a respectable
level of secondary industry. It was the good farmland around Mon¬
treal, finally, that permitted Canada to survive as a distinct entity into
the nineteenth century and provided the base that facilitated the dev¬
elopment of Upper Canada as a British province rather than as an
annex of New York.

However, the inability of Lower Canadian agriculture to support an
effective economy of the larger size and intensified tempo required by
the dynamic nineteenth century must also be recognized. To begin
with, so limited a base could not support a very large expansion of
population. Secondly, while it is not unlikely that New France could
have developed an efficient surplus-producing agriculture had depend¬
able markets existed to encourage it, it has already been pointed out
how continual frustration withered the power and will to produce.
The obstacles to efficiency (in a capitalistic sense) imposed by feudal
###### institutions were accentuated by continual subdivision which produced
strip farms less and less economic or capable of improvement. Finally,
soil exhaustion forced the agricultural heartland of Lower Canada
###### out of wheat production after 1835. If Canada had had no other agri¬
cultural base at that time, not only the growth but the survival of its
economy would have been doubtful. Rescue was effected, and a really

strong foundation for Canadian development laid, by the settlement
of Upper Canada. The critical step may be defined even more narrowly,
as the push of settlement past the marginal agricultural land in the
east of the province to the rich soils around York, and westward from
it. Here was a land able to produce large surpluses; or, to turn the
###### matter around, a land in which the cost of production of farm products
was exceptionally low. According to the information collected by a
Committee of the House of Assembly in 1835, the cost of raising wheat
was only about two-thirds as much in the western part of the province
as in the east.13 And this may have understated the western advantage.

It was important, too, that the basic population of the upper pro¬
vince, and especially of its western parts, consisted of American immi¬
grants, and that it was they who established its original institutions and
outlook. Whatever their deficiencies, the Americans were never accus¬
ed of lacking enterprise and efficiency. They were mobile, adaptable
and mechanically ingenious. They were not interested in self-suffi¬
ciency, as such, and were always ready to produce surpluses and to
push exchange to the limits of profitability. Whereas investment,
commerce and manufactures tended to be the prerogatives of partic¬
ular strata of French society, the skill, capital and enterprise which
these functions required were widely diffused in American society.
American settlers used them from the beginning to establish grist
mills and saw mills, stores, stopping places and blacksmith shops, as
well as freehold farms oriented to profit-making: to form, in fact, a
replica of the highly-developed local economy which they had known
in the American colonies. The economic structure thus constructed
was one that assumed surplus production and exchange, and provided
automatically for intensification and widening of them whenever
market conditions permitted.

A third vital fact about western Upper Canada was its remoteness
from tidewater and a consequent difficulty and cost of transport that
militated against attempts at staple production. The fur trade did not
last long after the settlement of Upper Canada, and the province had
no great share in it. There was a trade in potash, but this was an
ephemeral activity incidental to the clearing of land. The timber trade,
when it came, was not very well suited to the small operators typical of
the upper province, or to regions other than the Ottawa; and, in any
case, the basic economic pattern of most of the province had been
established before it appeared. The settlers would have been willing
to export wheat, and eventually did so; but there were good reasons —
###### transport costs and the British Corn Laws among them — why this
trade was insignificant for a long time. The western part of the pro¬
vince was thus thrown back upon its own resources and made into a

But regions, especially new ones, do not live very conveniently on
local exchanges alone, no matter how well endowed in other respects.
This was one of the points stressed by R. Hamilton, merchant of
Queenston, in an illuminating reply of 1803 to the question whether
Canada could feed the whole of the British forces in Canada and the
West Indies. Such a market, said Hamilton, would be a great advan¬
tage to Canadians, as offering to them what they most essentially
want, a Steady Market for the overplus of their agricultural produce,
and the means for paying for many Articles of conveniency, which
they can neither raise, nor well dispense with."14 He noted that wes¬
tern Upper Canada already produced substantial surpluses of wheat
and beef, and considered that if there were a steady demand at 3s. lVid.
currency per bushel for wheat and 2Vid. average per pound for beef,
supply might be indefinitely increased. Pork, though not produced
hitherto in any quantity, would be forthcoming also at reasonable
prices. But Hamilton then turned to the other aspect of the question —
the awkwardness and cost of transportation to seaboard. He suspected
that the Seaport merchants" would be unwilling to promote an export
trade in produce from Upper Canada, and that the shipping monopoly,
in particular, would yield nothing to assist it. "We have to lament that
hitherto, their Capitals generally engaged in perhaps more lucrative,
certainly in less bulky Speculation, (they) have been rather unwilling¬
ly employed, in encouraging our Agricultural pursuits, and that the
Charges on our Produce, have been such as it could hardly bear." The
cost of carriage between Montreal and Kingston "has not been de¬
creased for the last Twenty Years — Calculating indeed the fall in the
price of Labour, and of Provisions, we are induced to believe that the
Charge has augmented."15

In actuality. Upper Canada was not required to run the gauntlet of
the St. Lawrence for many years — which may be to say that the sea¬
board merchants overreached themselves and drove the upper pro¬
vince to an independent development. The real secret of Upper
Canada s success, and a crucial step as well in the development of a
national economy, was the province's discovery of local markets for its
produce that were large enough to support it for several decades. The
first of these had existed for years before Hamilton wrote the letter
quoted above, and was provided by the British taxpayer on behalf of
the British military forces. The consumers consisted not, indeed, of all
the British forces in the western hemisphere, but of the forces in
Upper Canada. Particularly in the western part of the province, around
Niagara and York, army agents were pleased to buy local produce
rather than face the difficulty and expense of bringing supplies up the
St. Lawrence. This military demand typically outran local supply. Des¬
pite a certain amount of competition for this business from American


-----

farmers, the effect was to establish a price structure for farm produce
that, instead of being the Atlantic price minus transportation costs
down the St. Lawrence —which an exporting community would have
had to accept —was the Atlantic price plus transport costs.16 Not until
about 1830, and later still in some parts, did supply so outstrip demand
as to end this happy condition.

To be sure, military garrisons were incapable of consuming the pro¬
vince's surpluses indefinitely, and they did so only till about 1810. But
a new market appeared with the influx of immigrant settlers. Long
before these persons began to contribute to production, they were
buyers of food, of seed and of stock, for which they paid with imported
funds or commitments of future income. As long as the inflow of set¬
tlers kept increasing, their coming provided a formula for perpetual
prosperity. Meanwhile, the War of 1812-14 had made its contribution
on behalf of the local market. The war disrupted production, while a
good part of the province's population came upon the payroll of the
British government by way of the militia. The consequence was an arti¬
ficial, temporary, but very obvious buoyancy of the market for farm
products.

About the same time another home market was opening up with the
expansion of the Ottawa Valley timber industry. The demand for food
and animal fodder which it entailed was so great that Ottawa Valley
farmers were notoriously prosperous far into the nineteenth century,
in spite of the poor soils which they farmed.17 It may be objected that
timber camps were not properly a home rqarket: Ottawa Valley far¬
mers were put in the position of being indirectly dependent on the
staple timber trade, just as the position of French-Canadian farmers
had been rendered ambiguous by an indirect dependence on the fur
trade. Nor can it have been entirely accidental that in the Rebellion of
1837 the farmers tributary to the timber regions remained loyal to the
British connection which represented staple production, in contrast to
the farmers further west whose experience and interest was in an in¬
dependent economy in which their superior fruitfulness would bene¬
fit the local population instead of being drained off to pay shipping
costs and to provide cheap food for foreigners.18 Nevertheless, the
market created by the timber trade contributed, along with the mili¬
tary and settler markets, to foster local development. It lifted the whole
###### structure of demand for agricultural products in the province. The
highest contours of the price structure were in the timber areas
around 1850. Timber production encouraged manufactures of wood
directly, and through the demand of the lumbermen and especially of
the supporting farmers, stimulated manufacturing in general. When
emphasis shifted from timber for Great Britain to lumber production


-----

ported a larger number and wider variety of persons, enabled many
small and medium-sized operators to flourish and accumulate pro¬
fits, and unified and strengthened the Canadian economy by provid¬
ing the timber regions with a clear place and interest in it.

By various local demands, then — of military garrisons, of
immigrants and of the timber trade — Upper Canada was protected for
nearly half a century from the obligation to find outside markets for
its produce, and at the same time discouraged from the attempt by the
cost of transport down the St. Lawrence. The inadequacy of that
unimproved waterway, indeed, was only part of the problem: settlers
who were more than twenty miles from a waterfront were virtually
prohibited from exporting by the high cost of wagon transport, and
the result was that they produced a volume of output much smaller
than they were easily capable of. In spite of this drag on production,
the time had eventually to come when, with more and more cleared
land coming into use, and immigration checked, local supply would out¬
run local demand. Such a crisis threatened in the 1830s. The solution
offered by exporting down the St. Lawrence had the disadvantages
that it required a sharp lowering of the price structure — hitherto
supported rather than depressed by transport costs — and that it
involved reversal of the principle that prices were highest in the west.
If Upper Canada had been new and unformed, the Atlantic price sys¬
tem might nevertheless have been able to impose its directive upon
the colony and enroll it as another competing supplier in the Atlantic
system. The province, however, was no longer an infant. It had enjoyed
several decades of relatively independent and prosperous development;
it had acquired a substantial population, a strong agricultural base,
thriving towns and cities, a vigorous and even frantic level of political
organization and activity. It was not to be expected that this province
would be transformed easily into a staple-producing handmaiden of
international commerce, even though its first awkward attempt to de¬
clare its economic and political independence — the Rebellion of 1837 —
seemed to be a complete failure.*19

How the province would have fared in a career of independence if
new forces had not entered the scene, is difficult to say. As a strictly
local economy at the grist and saw mill stage, its prospect would seem
to have been an unattractive vegetation. Transformation to a more
sophisticated level through construction of railways and factories
would have been a difficult and slow process, if it had depended on
local capital and incentives. An active and vocal population had plans
to speed the transition, however. Roads offered some help, and many

were built. Stimulation of the Economy by an increase in the money
supply was a fairly popular policy in Canada, as in the contemporary
United States: agitation on this side supported Lord Sydenham's* un¬
successful effort to establish a government Bank of Issue in 1841 and
a species of free banking in Canada in the 1850s. The remedy most
often recommended for the province's ills, however, was protection.20
Perhaps these devices could have preserved some acceptable level of
local prosperity. If they failed, or if the British government prevented
use of them, new political crises and some sort of accommodation with
the United States might have ensued. As it turned out, however, Cana¬
dians did not have to find out what they might have made of their
economy by their own efforts, and the policies conceived to deal with
the problem remained to take new forms in another context. What
altered their situation fundamentally was the successful completion
of a canal network in the 1840s and the triumphant sweep of railway
lines in the 1850s.

It is a supreme irony of history that the improvements made to the
St. Lawrence system of water transport, and the railways that dupli¬
cated and supplemented it, were conceived by those who dreamt of
binding Canada more firmly into the system of transatlantic exchange,
were financed by British governments and investors having the same
expectation, yet had the opposite effect of creating a viable Canadian
economy. The promoters and investors were not wrong in supposing
###### that the cost of carrying goods from the hinterland to seaboard would
be lowered sharply, and exports so far encouraged — when other con¬
ditions were favourable in the 1850s, wheat and meat were exported
to Britain from Upper Canada, and the accompanying prosperity
proved to be highly congenial to Canadians. The planners and investors
were no more blind than others to the consequences of two great facts
of mid-century: British free trade and New York's enormous success
in engrossing the interior trade of North America. They were less per¬
spicacious than they might have been, however, in assessing what
canals and railways would do to the Canadian economy. In the first
place, their construction involved the expenditure of considerable
sums of British money on locally-produced capital goods, and the ex¬
penditure of much larger sums, through the medium of armies of con¬
###### struction workers, upon local food and shelter. The canals in a small
way, and the railways in a large one, required a smaller but permanent
and better paid army of men to operate them. They and their families

filled out the towns and cities, stimulating construction, trade and the
local manufacture of consumer goods. Meanwhile, the new transport
systems supported local manufacture of rolling stock, while construc¬
tion had provided a way for some contractors to accumulate the capital
required to participate in these manufactures. Canals had promoted
manufactures in another way, by making waterpower sites available,
at the same time that they widened the market for factory products.
The greatest change of all was effected by those railways, like the
Northern and Great Western, that penetrated the fertile but hitherto
landlocked interior. Masses of subsistence farmers along the lines
were suddenly enabled to sell in a wide market and to buy consumer
goods and machinery with their earnings, and were encouraged to
maximize their outputs. Surpluses thus exposed to the market were
sometimes exported — though it was typically lumber consigned to
the United States, rather than anything for Britain, that the new lines
first carried. But food surpluses brought from remote farms by the
railways usually found their market in the growing Canadian cities.21
Still more important, the purchases of the masses thus introduced to
exchange as the normal way of life, while they included cloth and
crockery and tea from abroad, were most often of goods produced in
Canada. Farm machinery came from the local blacksmith, or from
"factories" springing up in town and city, or perhaps from the United
States — but not likely from Britain. Clothing and shoes, usually pro¬
duced hitherto in the home and the village shop but now distributed in
a national market, came briefly from a domestic handicraft industry in
Lower Canada, but soon from city factories equipped with machines.
Manufactures of wood —doors, windows, pails, barrels and, increas-
ingly, furniture — offered an obvious field for local enterprise. But
hardware, tobacco and alcoholic manufactures flourished also in the
room provided by the railways. The fact was that the British manufac¬
turers' advantages of experience, larger scale and lower wages were
more than offset in a wide range of manufactures by lower transport
costs of Canadian producers, their acquaintance with the peculiarities
of local demand and their greater readiness to cater to them. In the
manufacturing fields that developed in the 1850s in L-anada, it was
American producers who offered the severe competition. In their case,
however, it was politically acceptable, and even patriotic, to establish
the barrier of a protective tariff. The net effect of Canada's revolution
in transport, then, was much less the stimulation of exports, or of
imports, than the presentation to Canada's farmers and manufacturers
of the coherent home market which they would have had the greatest
difficulty in creating for themselves. Meanwhile, immigration provided
for the variety of skills necessary to operate a diversified economy, to
the extent it had not already done so; while capital though scarcely


-----

abundant, was drawn in several ways from Britain and the United
States. Transportation provided the keystone and catalyst of these
ingredients of a developing national economy.22

The Political Possibility of Canadian Development

Beside the question of the physical possibility of economic develop¬
ment in Canada is the question of its political possibility. That develop¬
ment did become politically possible is an historical fact. It is a fact,
however, that needs a political as well as a physical explanation. How
was it that the mercantile interest entrenched on the St. Lawrence,
backed by British interests which it represented, devoted to staple
exchange and indifferent or hostile to diversification, long successful
in maintaining Montreal as the leading agency of trade between
Europe and interior North America, was forced or persuaded to coun¬
tenance an independent Canadian development? The answer is that
the merchants overreached themselves; that, paradoxically, they lost
because they clung so narrowly to the logic of staple exchange; that
competing merchants won because they were carried along, in spite of
themselves, by slow-moving but massive economies that were not
devoted to staple production. The answer, again, is that while mercan¬
tile aims were simple and narrow, imperial aims were not and fre¬
quently provided important support for economic diversification. The
answer is also that the transportation facilities constructed in the
last desperate attempt to hold the interior for the St. Lawrence sys¬
tem, failed to accomplish that purpose; hence, their incidental func¬
tion of creating a Canadian economy also became their only function.
The answer is, finally that Canadian sentiment in favour of an inde¬
pendent and protected economy, already strong in 1840, received an
enormous impetus from Britain's turn to free trade, both because free
trade represented a demotion of those staple trades that required
preferences, and because Canadians considered that they had been
betrayed and abandoned. These points require some elaboration.

Merchants The merchants who operated the world of commercial capi¬
talism and occupied the strategic places in the Canadian economy
until about 1850 were engaged in securing differential gains between
the prices at which they bought commodities and the prices at which
they re-sold them. Any saleable commodity would do, but preference
was for staples. Their volume was large and regular, and their market¬
ability was ready and relatively secure. The commodities that provided
for the great trades of the eighteenth century — sugar, tobacco, fur
and so forth — were few in number, and even such additions as timber
and cotton in the nineteenth century did not make the list very long.

sufficient Europeans, serving as comforts rather than necessities.
However, the staples made up a very high proportion of what overseas
commerce there was, and the rest was highly unpredictable, so that
merchants concentrated on staples. Though the merchant preferred
to limit his risks in this way, his business was perpetual speculation.
His gains consisted of other men's losses, seized with the aid of stronger
bargaining positions, greater foresight and later intelligence. It may
be doubted that the merchant conceived himself as creating "utilities".23

The merchant was a capitalist. It was his possession of capital, to¬
gether with other peoples' lack of it, that allowed him to seize differ¬
ential advantages in trade. The capital was conceived of as a sum of
money beyond the amount required for the owner's maintenance.
The more of it the merchant had, and the more expeditiously he could
change it into goods and back into (more) money, the more profit he
could make. Quick turnover had the additional, and greatly-prized,
advantage that it kept the merchant close to liquidity, which was
valued because it facilitated early escape or seizure of new opportu¬
nities.

The merchant s passion for liquidity was a reason for his concen¬
tration on staple goods for which there were relatively dependable
markets. It was also a cause of his reluctance to become involved in
production. The merchant was particularly loath to sink money into
fixed capital. Sums spent in this way diminished the circulating capital
with which the merchant conducted his speculations. Moreover, fixed
capital might be hard to sell, even at a heavy loss, and the time requir¬
ed to sell it impeded mobility. Merchants sometimes invested in
mines, ironworks and shipyards, nevertheless, when they promised to
confer an exceptional strategic advantage. The results were often
unsatisfactory, however; especially because mercantile emphasis
upon immediacy, upon discrete transactions, upon prices, rendered
the typical merchant a peculiarly unfit person to handle employees
or organize regular production.24 Where no strategic positions in
production were available — and trades based upon immense and
ubiquitous supplies of raw materials tended to have this characteris¬
tic—the merchant preferred to confine himself to the purchase of
finished goods. With the bargaining power afforded by his capital, he
might reap large returns from this position, even to the extent of
crushing his suppliers out of existence.

The typical merchant was not likely to worry much about that, for
his time-horizon was short and his sense of any responsibility towards
the area which he exploited of the faintest.25 These characteristics fol¬
low readily enough from the nature of mercantile business; they were
no doubt useful, and perhaps essential, for men required to establish
first the trade structure of Europe and later the trade structure over-

seas. They were qualities that tended to set merchants apart as an
alien element, however, especially in new countries like Canada
where there had been little time for local loyalties to develop. It is
notorious that generations of St. Lawrence merchants regarded
themselves as temporary residents in Canada, unfortunately exiled
from the United Kingdom for as little time as they might require to
amass and carry off a fortune. Like the lumberman stripping a wood¬
land which he expects never to see again, the future of the exploited
area did not concern them.26

It was with this attitude in the background that the empire of the St.
Lawrence was constructed as the furthest-extended, the most
weakly-based, the most perfectly mercantile of all the seaboard colo¬
nies. It approached the mercantile ideal of a colony in which all finished
goods were either exported or imported, in which all resources were
devoted to the extension and support of overseas trade tentacles, with
none frittered away upon local production and exchange. To fight the
battle of trade, it was modelled, not upon the standing army, but upon
the task force — supremely mobile, effective while resistance was
slight, but incapable of facing strong opposition. To the merchant
concerned about the next decade (at the longest), the efficiency and
economy of the task force was appealing, its ultimate inadequacy of
little concern. The St. Lawrence economy succumbed to massive
force, in the end, partly because it had been built for maximum success
in the age before massive force appeared.

The merchants of the St. Lawrence ought not to be blamed, or cred¬
ited, too far. The attitude of Montreal merchants was not significantly
different from that of other mercantile agents of Britain in New York,
###### Charleston or New Orleans, who likewise accepted scarcely any res¬
ponsibility for the welfare of the region in which they operated.27
Rather, agents in many of the American cities had much less success
than those in Montreal in preventing the development of a diversified
economy, increasingly independent of London. Moreover, the atten¬
uated nature of the St. Lawrence economy, though it owed some¬
thing to mercantile policy and the exceptionally strong political posi¬
tion which merchants were able to occupy in Canada between 1765 and
1835, owed more to the weakness of Canada's agricultural base before
the settlement of Upper Canada. It could be said, also, that St. Law¬
rence merchants invested to some extent in local enterprises; though
their most extensive investments — their seizure of the seigneuries at
bargain prices and their looting of the public lands—rather under¬
line their social irresponsibility than prove any other point. But one
serious charge can be made against the merchants even within their
own code of morality: that they miscalculated in contemptuously dis¬


-----

Fowke has remarked, they depended on it more than they thought.28
For this neglect they paid a suitable if not an adequate price, for the local
economy failed to support them in their hour of need, and then passed
beyond them.

Generals and Governors Merchants were not the only, or even the most
influential, of imperial agents in Canada. That distinction belonged to
military and civil officials, and these, while they supported the eco¬
nomic interests of their principles and therefore supported the mercan¬
tile interest in a general way, reflected an imperial interest that was
broader and deeper than that of the merchants. The administrators
had no particular concern for the welfare of the colony, as such, any
more than the merchants: the colony was valuable only as it magnified
imperial wealth and power. In practice, however, administrative ac¬
tions were more likely than mercantile ones to serve the long-term
###### interests of the colony. For one thing, imperial officers had a very
much longer time-horizon than merchants and could contemplate
###### investment in developments that might not yield returns for a life¬
time. Moreover, their calculations were conducted in a very broad
context that emphasized military power and prestige. Until around
1835, administrative thinking about Canada had to do primarily with
the problem of survival in war.

A colony's prospect of survival and of useful participatibn during
###### war was enhanced the more compactly it was settled, and the more its
economy was diversified, made self-sufficient and therefore immune
to blockade. Since this military criterion stood in flat contradiction to
the mercantile ideal of maximum exchange, imperial policy tended to
be ambivalent, fluctuating with the imminence of war. French policy
supported development of the colony more consistently than British,
despite the desire of officials as well as merchants to make money
from the fur trade, because a French colony was almost certain to be
isolated for long periods in wartime.29 The French state took extreme
steps to populate New France. It fostered agricultural settlement,
###### with arrangements well calculated to make settlement rapid and com¬
pact, and to keep the settlers content, obedient and disciplined for war
service. It promoted the Quebec shipyards, the St. Maurice ironworks
and some other industrial enterprises to make the colony diversified
and defensible. It bequeathed to the succeeding British administration
a tradition of planning and management of the economy and a struc¬
###### ture well started on diversification — foundations from which further
development could be launched.

British administrators also worked to strengthen and round the
economy, again in preparation for war. During the first few years
###### after the Conquest the presiding generals operated a military kind of


-----

                                                     -
planned economy, intervened vigorously to put markets in order, and
used force and conscription to put the shipyards and ironworks back
into production.30 After 1783, encouragement given to settlers from
Britain and from the former American colonies, and the care taken to
###### put them in compact blocks at strategic places, paralleled earlier
French policies closely. Road building, important for defence, but per¬
haps more important still for development, was actively pursued.
After the War of 1812-14, a very ambitious program was undertaken
with development of the elaborate dockyard at Kingston, promotion
of the Marmora ironworks that were intended to supply it with iron,
and construction of the Rideau Canal. It is true that Marmora was a
failure, that the impetus given to lake shipping by the concentration of
skills and equipment at the dockyard was indirect, and that the Rideau
Canal did not, from a commercial point of view, very much relieve the
###### transportation bottleneck betwen Upper and Lower Canada. On the other hand, the canal's contribution in opening up a large section of
Upper Canada; the support which expenditure on all these projects
gave to immigration, settlement and town growth; the unmeasurable
but scarcely insignificant effect of the skills and processes which they
introduced into the colony; above all, the readiness of the authorities
to ignore mercantile desires: all deserve to be recognized.31

This is not intended to deny that British administrators stood ulti¬
mately for Britain's commercial interest, for staple exports from the
colony and an open market for British manufacturers in it. They did so
during the American Revolution, when Canada was held by naked
force in defiance of popular opinion.32 The independence generally
favoured at that time by habitants and artisans implied a more bal¬
anced and self-sufficient economic structure, while the consideration
###### that induced most of the merchants to give their tepid support to the
British connection was their hope of larger fur exports by way of the
St. Lawrence.33 Again, in 1837, the rebels stood, among other things,
for a rounded economy that would provide a local market for agricul¬
tural produce; while the official party stood, among other things, for
###### transatlantic trade that might involve very disadvantageous terms for wheat producers. Between times, however, administrators did their
part to develop Canada to the point that it could become an indepen¬
dent economy, whether merchants liked that or not.

###### The Loss of the Empire of the St. Lawrence.

The United States achieved political unity in 1789, if not in 1776, but
they were incapable of economic unity for several more decades.
###### Rather the country consisted of a series of discrete economic entities
along the Atlantic seaboard, each built around a port city, united in


-----

economy for which each of the port cities acted as an agent. The posi¬
tion of these cities, then, paralleled that of the St. Lawrence cities. A
realistic economic map of North America around 1790 would have
taken small account of political boundaries, but would have empha¬
sized the string of client ports — Montreal, New York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Charleston (Boston and New England towns standing
###### somewhat apart) — in sharp rivalry with each other for British custom.
Each city exercised economic suzerainty over a hinterland, which it
###### sought to extend. Control became shadowy with distance, however,
while small ports tried to carve out little hinterlands of their own, so
###### that the boundaries of each commercial empire tended to be vague and
fluctuating.34

The coastal cities were supported, in the first place, by their imme¬
diate hinterlands — the regions so close to the city itself, and so distant
from any other port of significance, that they were bound to trade
through their local port. Some of these hinterlands were much more
extensive and fruitful than others. Philadelphia was especially fa¬
voured in this respect, with a great sweep of good land between the sea
and the mountains, and it was this circumstance chiefly that made
Philadelphia the metropolis of America in the eighteenth century,
with a population well ahead of New York's and far above that of any
other place.35 New York, too, had a respectable hinterland close by and
a very large potential one up the Hudson. The importance to the city's
expansion of the development of upper New York state is suggested
by assertions that the spectacular growth of New York's population
began about 1783, and that this population doubled between 1786 and
1796.36 Baltimore, which grew very rapidly in the first half of the
nineteenth century, had the aid of a solid agricultural hinterland at its
doorstep. New Orleans, when it developed, seemed to command the
most sweeping hinterland of all, and might have mounted on it to
become the leading emporium of the continent, if it could have ar¬
ranged for the suppression of canals and railroads. The immediate hin¬
terland of Montreal, on the other hand, was relatively limited, though
its Upper Canadian annex bore comparison with the regions com¬
manded by most other cities.

Local hinterlands tended to be taken for granted, however, by the
commercial communities that dominated the great ports. These fo¬
cused their ambitions rather upon that glittering prize, the potential
trade of the interior of the continent, which each port hoped to chan¬
nel through itself to Europe. In the contest for this prize, natural
advantages again varied greatly, so that on the Atlantic Seaboard only
Montreal and New York commanded natural routes into the interior.
But each of the cities insistently used city and state governments, and
could sometimes win aid from the American federal government, to


-----

advance its interest by the construction of transport routes inland: a
competitive endeavour to which North America owes, more than any¬
thing else, its characteristic east-west structure. Philadelphia had al¬
ready benefited in 1758 by the opening of Forbes Road, which linked it
to Pittsburgh. The city capitalized upon its exceptionally strong base,
by enlisting the money and manpower of Pennsylvania to build other
ways across the mountains. The Pennsylvania Canal, a remarkable
engineering feat, was completed early in the nineteenth century; and
when this work proved incapable of fulfilling its purpose, and the
railway age dawned, the Pennsylvania Railroad was promoted.37
These systems succeeded in holding the trade of the Ohio Valley for
Philadelphia for many years. Nevertheless, they failed to win an inland
empire for Philadelphia, in spite of the initial power possessed by that
city, because the mountains were so high and rough in this region that
the routes could not excel in economic competition. In the nineteenth
century, therefore, in comparison with other cities, Philadelphia vege¬
tated graciously.

Baltimore was much smaller and also faced a formidable mountain
barrier. It had an advantage over all other ports, however, in linear
distance from the interior. It also benefited in an exceptional degree,
because of its nearness to Washington, from such efforts as the
American federal government was allowed to make to unify the
states. The most striking of these ventures, and the one that did most
for Baltimore, was the Cumberland Road, leading from Washington
to the Ohio watershed, and eventually to Illinois.38 The city's position
was also strengthened by construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio
Canal, as by the improvements to local waterways that had preceded
it. Its greatest achievement, however, was the Baltimore and Ohio
Railway, on which Baltimore gambled very early and very heavily —
the line which, by its central position and directness to the interior,
became the base of North American freight rate structures. Despite
these successes, Baltimore never approached a position of engrossing
the trade of the interior to the exclusion of other cities. The same
could be said of Boston, which had been kept out of competition in the
age of waterways by geographic barriers, and which entered a late but
powerful railway challenge with the aid of its financial power but
never achieved more than a regional supremacy.39

A stronger contender than these was New York, already pulling
ahead of Philadelphia in population in 1810. Besides its strong local
base, it possessed a good strategic position for coastal trade between
versatile New England and the bread, tobacco and rice colonies to the
south. In respect to the interior, however, its enormous advantage
over all other American cities was its command of the Hudson River

New York to establish its pre-eminence over other cities by means of
###### the Erie Canal, to consolidate that position with the aid of the New
York Central and other railways, and to stand unassailable even by
1850 as prime beneficiary of continental expansion. The city's brilliant
###### future was not obvious in 1800, however, or even in 1820, for Mon¬
treal seemed to command an even better gap and a far more magnifi¬
cent water route into the heart of the continent — a route unmatched
except by the Mississippi, and superior to the Mississippi in many re¬
spects. Montreal was closer to Liverpool than New York by three
###### hundred miles, and the St. Lawrence region disposed of some impor¬ tant staples welcomed in European markets. Montreal's exclusion from
the American union involved both advantages and disadvantages for
it, but did not seem very important until about 1840, that is, until the
United States was forged into a genuine economic unit by railways, by
which time New York had already won its continental supremacy in
economic competition.40 How, then, could the city whose mountain gap
only led to a difficult portage route to Lake Ontario, triumph over the
city that enjoyed a continuous majestic highway to the Upper Lakes?
###### Neither is it apparent, on first sight, how the digging of an insignifi¬
cant ditch across northern New York state could make the crucial dif¬
ference.

The Erie Canal41 was the fruit of masterly political leadership by De
Witt Clinton. It represented the first acceptance in America of an
engineering fact that a straightforward canal usually produces a better
channel for navigation than an improved river bed. The canal was built
expeditiously, with the aid of some striking innovations in construc¬
tion methods. All the same, it was not a very remarkable canal, as canals
go; and, decidedly, it did not give New York a cheaper route than
Montreal to the interior. Montreal's superiority in this respect was so
###### apparent to New Yorkers that they took care to avoid competition by terminating their canal on Lake Erie rather than Lake Ontario. Even
so, when the canal was completed in 1825, the freight rate from Buffalo
to New York was $1.00 per hundredweight, whereas the rate to Mon¬
treal was 50 cents.42 Moreover, improvements could be and were being
made to the St. Lawrence, which was also to benefit shortly from an
imperial preference on exports, regardless of their origin.43

New York's victory cannot be attributed, either, to its earlier pos¬
session of railroads. The railway was immensely important to New
York: its lines to Chicago became the core of the North American
###### transport system and the main muscle by which the whole continent
was bent to pay tribute to this port. But New York's pre-eminence
over other cities was won before the railways, which merely held and
underlined it, and if the case had been otherwise, railways alone could
###### not have brought victory. Railways offer speed, convenience, access


-----

to regions remote from water; but they have never afforded cheaper
###### transport than water, and bulky goods for which cheap transport is
essential have continued to move by water.44 It was not until 1839, on
the eve of rail communication with the seaboard, that Chicago began
to export grain; and the railways had arrived before the grain trade
was of any consequence. Yet grain moved by water, in spite of the fact
###### that lake shipping had to expand feverishly to handle it.45 But Chi¬
cago's grain did not go by way of Montreal, in spite of its lower inland
freight rates and its shorter ocean route to Britain.46

The reason for New York's success was not much of a mystery,
though Montrealers acted as if it was, as if their superior inland water
###### route gave them title to the continental trade, and as if some mechani¬
cal adjustment which they had so far overlooked would restore their
property to its rightful owners. They fussed about the rapids, about
the shallowness of Lake St. Peter, about French-Canadian obstruction
of the improvements they desired, about imperial preferences: all
###### important in their way, but all beside the main point. The main point
was that New York enjoyed a great advantage over Montreal in ocean
freight rates — a large enough difference that, once the Erie Canal was
opened, it more than made up for Montreal's advantage on inland
rates.47 In addition. New York sailings were more regular and port
operating costs were lower. Carriers preferred the volume, regularity
and diversity of New York traffic, the better balance of inbound and
outbound cargoes; and they preferred these things with increasing
urgency as overhead costs became a larger proportion of total ship¬
ping costs. Moreover, New York's advantages of economy and con¬
venience were cumulative, as more traffic justified more ships, and
more ships justified more traffic.48

And what explains the size, balance and dependability of traffic that
had given New York its initial advantage of lower ocean rates? Pri¬
marily, the volume and diversity of exchanges which a well-developed
hinterland occasioned, along with the power to draw on neighbouring
communities that were still more versatile, mature and solid. The
Canadian provinces, on whose traffic Montreal might reasonably
count, contained about 550,000 persons in 1820. New York City itself
contained a quarter as many, and there were ten millions in the United
States, of whom at least a third must have occasioned some traffic for
the port, and that in wide variety. Montreal merchants inclined to the
view that local populations did not matter much, that diversification
which militated against transatlantic exchanges was pernicious, that
it was the great export trades in staples that counted. The local econo-
omies of farmers, traders and numerous artisans of many skills which
###### throve in the northern and middle states, but which were rather less


-----

possessed a high degree of local self-sufficiency, so that overseas sales
and purchases involved perhaps no more than 10 per cent of total
receipts and expenditures. On the other hand, the solid prosperity
which these economies often enjoyed not only maintained the volume
###### but the regularity and variety of a traffic that provided ports with the
kind of commerce that shippers prized. The imbalance of incoming
and outgoing traffic on the St. Lawrence on the other hand, and the
lack of variety that provides alternative opportunities, diminished the
popularity of that route and raised its rates. Local development was
more important than the St. Lawrence merchants appreciated, not
only in their own businesses, but because it armed New York to defeat
them.

The locally-oriented economies typical of the northern states
doomed the St. Lawrence route in still another way, by gradual but in¬
exorable settlement of its former trading territories. The frontier of
###### settlement moved slowly, inching its way across the continent, in contrast to the dashing trade parties thrown out from Montreal. But, whereas Montreal's thrusts were flimsy and transitory, the American structure was solid right back to the base port and its advance immen¬
sely powerful. American frontier settlements could, and sometimes
did, trade through Montreal; but their tendency, even in the absence
of tariff barriers, was to trade through agencies familiar to them,
which catered to them and to the host of settlers closer in who were
like them. A port developed in relation to an expanding area of settle¬
###### ment was not likely to decline very far, though its functions could be transformed as a continental economy developed. But Montreal,
geared narrowly to skim the superficial resources of the interior, could
lose everything that its merchants considered to be valuable. Its de¬
feat, in fact, was accomplished very quickly. Whereas New York had
feared, in planning its Erie Canal, to locate a terminus short of Lake
Erie, it was ready to open a branch canal to Lake Ontario in 1828, a
branch that drew traffic that had come through the Welland Canal.
Waterways and railways integrated the American economy into a
meaningful unit by the 1840s, so that, for the first time, American
national policy could have been used decisively against Montreal. But
fear of Montreal was so quickly replaced by contempt as to permit the
insult of American bonding legislation in 1845 and the concession of
reciprocity in 1854. Montreal's agreement with New York about the
facts of contemporary economic life was expressed in the Annexation¬
ist Manifesto of 1849.

Montreal merchants were thus thrown back, unwillingly, upon the
###### support of the home economy which they had scorned. It was a stron¬
ger economy than they deserved or than the author of the Annexa¬


-----

considerable diversification had already been mounted upon it, and
the physical and ideological changes required for the successful oper¬
ation of a national economy were in progress. The mercantile interest
had a last contribution to make: to help to promote the trunk canals
and railways by means of which they hoped, vainly, to win back their
lost continent, but which served instead to tie the local economy to¬
gether. Then, the collapse of the empire of the St. Lawrence cleared
the way for recognition and promotion of a national alternative. The
simultaneous dismissal of Canada from the colonial system, as Britain
discovered a superior economic interest in free trade, made it easy for
even the most obtuse Canadians to recognize that the old order had
ended and that a new orientation was required.49

The Popular Demand for a National Economy

Among the remarkable heritages from the nineteenth century is a
doctrine widely circulated among succeeding generations that most
###### nineteenth-century men believed in laissez faire and free trade. When
this proposition was restricted in its application to the United King¬
dom, there was at least the evidence of British free trade to support
it.50 But so persuasive have been the propagandist powers of those
who favoured free trade or (a rather different thing) free enterprise
and wanted to give them the authority of historical tradition, that
scholars have been induced to apply this dogma to other countries,
even though they did not necessarily approve of free trade or free
enterprise themselves, were in possession of historical evidence that
they were not very popular outside the United Kingdom (or, for that
###### matter, in it), and had to deny their own evidence to retain their con¬
victions. Only at mid-twentieth century were American scholars able
to dig themselves out of the tradition that nineteenth-century Amer¬
icans believed in laissez faire and free enterprise,51 and Canadians
appear to have done less well. The "National Policy" of the 1870s of
building a Canadian national economy with the aid of protective tariffs
is still discussed readily as if there had been no policy of building a
national economy with the aid of protection in the 1860s, 1850s and
1840s.52 Again, with even less reason than Americans, Canadians
have declared that their nineteenth-century forebears were propo¬
nents and exponents of laissez faire and have treated the obvious evi¬
dence to the contrary as "exceptions". Thus, it was stated not long ago
in an historical document of some importance that "developmental
expenditure, in the pre-Confederation period, was the one permitted
exception to the traditional laissez-faire theory of governmental
functions ... "55 According to another historian, dealing with Canada's
canal building of the 1840s, "The imperial and provincial governments


-----

o canals they had made an exception, and had gone into business on a
arge scale. 54 When an historian was required to set out the views
###### that most Canadians actually held in the nineteenth century, he might

1-eel compelled to deprecate them and dissociate himself from them to
###### the point of declaring that historical evidence is unreal:

The arguments advanced by Le Nouveau Monde in favour of protec¬
tion were certainly not original. They were the stereotyped mer¬
cantilist views, set forward with some vigour, but with little at¬
###### tempt to adapt them to conditions in Canada. They may be regard¬
ed as a general statement of principles, supported by a large amount
of examples drawn from the tariff history of various countries. It
was pointed out, for instance, that France was most prosperous
###### under the system of tariffs instituted by Colbert and most power¬
ful when her industries were protected by Napoleon... the
###### triumph of the Northern over the Southern states was traced to
the high tariff which had turned the North into a great work¬
shop. Unreal as these arguments appear to-day, in the seventies
###### they were accepted as valid.. ,55

The facts are that the tradition familiar to Canadians of the nine¬
###### teenth century was one of state intervention and regulation; that
laissez faire was little honoured in government policy and little admir¬
ed by the public; that Canadians gave a very qualified approval to free
competition in the market — home market or international market;
###### that those few residents educated to the intricacies of British free trade doctrine were likely to argue that Canadian conditions made the
doctrine unsuitable for their country; and that the Canadian public
favoured protection and other forms of intervention to build a nation¬
al economy, sporadically in the early nineteenth century, passionately
in the 1840s and consistently thereafter.

Most of Canada's residents of the nineteenth century learned their
social policy not from Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill or Herbert Spen¬
cer, but from French and British social usages and colonial systems. In
the eighteenth century, and in the first half of the nineteenth in most
parts of the provinces, there was a general acceptance of a class struc¬
###### ture derived from, though less clear cut than, European ones, that
involved differential rights and duties, and criteria of loyalty and "re¬
spectability" rather than of merit by some objective test or success in
###### the marketplace. Until about 1840, the privileged and educated and their supporters were quick to emphasize that Canada was substan¬
tially free of the democratic practices of the barbarous Americans and,
###### therefore, of the mob rule and thoughtless measures which they pro¬
duced. The determination of policy by those born and trained to rule


-----

laws and forces. What had been learned about policy in the French
period was that the king was the father and leader of his people, who
arranged the settlement of the country by cajolery and force, provided
wives for the settlers, imposed corvees and military service but gave
protection against seigneurs and enemies, founded and operated key
industries, regulated much and was prepared in principle to regulate
all. The Conquest brought a change of masters but little change in
policy. For the first few years the new authorities operated the most
thoroughly planned and directed economy that Canada has had, and,
with a minimum of dependence on market forces, achieved substan¬
tial success in restoring production. Soon after, British rulers had
their turn at arranging the importation of settlers, providing them
with land, equipment and sustenance, and watching paternally over
their material and ideological welfare. In the first four decades of the
###### nineteenth century, policy was strongly influenced by military men
who believed firmly that defence was more important than opulence.
These officers practised a benevolent paternalism in many contexts,
but they were perfectly prepared to thwart both the will of the people
and the forces of the market on behalf of defence, as in their obstruc¬
tion of canals and industries on the frontier. It can be said, more sweep-
ingly, that the whole existence and history of Canada has been a denial
of laissez faire. Letting economic forces run their course would have
involved a much slower rate, and perhaps a different shape, of Euro¬
pean settlement. Letting the people determine their own political des¬
tiny would have involved the enrolment of the country as part of the
United States in 1775, and perhaps at some other times. Letting the
military weight in North America reach its own equilibrium would
have led similarly to the swallowing of Canada by the United States.

An important ingredient of Canadian attitudes was the very local
kind of sustenance economy and market in common necessities that
characterized Canada, and other countries, until the middle of the
###### nineteenth century. It was the structure of the eighteenth century,
with which the first half of the nineteenth century belongs economi¬
cally and spiritually; so that it is sharply different from the period after
1850, when a revolution in transport swept up local markets into
national and world ones, and produced a "modern" structure and out¬
look. Before 1850, the cost of transport — especially land transport —
was relatively very high. In consequence, every village enjoyed a sub¬
stantial level of "natural" protection against the producers and mer¬
chants of every other village: it was this circumstance that dispersed
artisans and their manufacturing places so widely over Europe and
###### northern North America, because differences in labour costs (the
ratio was 2:1 approximately as between American and British wage


-----

###### inhabitants of these protected local economies said that they believed
in competition as a check on prices, they were not likely to mean that
they wished competitive supplies of goods to be imported from other
towns, but rather that they would like to see a larger number of local
tailors, shoemakers and blacksmiths competing with each other. If
t ey opposed monopoly and desired its regulation, they might have in
mind the Bank of Upper Canada, but more likely, the local baker or
###### grist mill owner. When the cocoons of these localities were ripped asunder by waterways and railways, there was more horror than hope
as traditional channels of production and exchange were disrupted by
importations of cheaper manufactures from other towns, other re¬
gions or other countries, without regard for employment and liveli¬
hood. Cheerful doctrines of comparative advantage and division of
labour had no more power to quiet this distress than the doctrine of the
survival of the fittest consoles the drowning man. The fact is that com¬
petition, when it was made a national and international reality by tran¬
###### sport media, was thoroughly detested by European societies, and the
majority might well have banished it from the earth, if they had
known how to do so. Some relief was possible at national frontiers,
and tariff protection was increasingly favoured by all except those
who thought they could undersell others in "their own" market.
###### Manufacturers hastened to avoid the discipline of competition as
much as they could by means of mergers or monopolies. Some wage
###### earners were able to gain a measure of protection through unions.56 There remained a great number who were no more willing to let nature take its course, but found no means to protect themselves, and
were cast naked into the unregulated market. None of this experi¬
ence raised the reputation of competition, free trade or laissez faire.

A parallel ingredient of Canadian attitudes derived from traditional
experience with colonial systems of mercantilist origin. The British
colonial system may have operated unfairly against Canada. The colony
was required to take its imports from Britain, but among the short list
of commodities which Britain might have taken in exchange, wheat was
excluded most of the time until the 1840s by the Corn Laws, which
contained a colonial preference but seldom let any wheat in. Attempts
to substitute the export of hemp from Canada can hardly be regarded
as an adequate compensation.57 Canada was not expected to raise any
obstacles against the importation of British manufactures, however.
The British government was still making strenuous representations
against any Canadian protection in the 1840s, and also opposed mea¬
sures that, by expanding Canada's money supply, might have encour¬
aged local production indirectly and jeopardized the ready payment of
British exporters in sterling.58 Nevertheless, the colonial system was


-----

secure markets, and it would be difficult to prove that Canada was not
a net beneficiary in the system. The timber trade was created in the
interest of Britain, not of Canada, and it involved an extraordinarily
wasteful exploitation of Canadian forests; but it is also true that for
about forty years, Britain gave Canada a secure market for a major
export by paying prices much higher than it would have had to pay
elsewhere. In the 1840s, favourable preferences on flour, without
much restriction upon the origin of the grain used to make it, for a
###### short time made Canadian capitalists still more a favoured group. Not
all Canadians admired the colonial system, but objection was nearly
always to the balance of advantage, or to the concomitant political
control, rather than to intervention in principle. The great majority
seem to have regarded the system, even as it stood, as the essential
pillar of their existence. Their shock when Britain turned to free trade
was that of men whose employment and homestead had disappeared.
Their experience, or even the fact that they survived it with the help
of a new reciprocal security with the United States, could not per¬
suade them that free trade and laissez faire were desirable.

There is, finally, the point elaborated by historians: that the uncer¬
tainties associated with underdeveloped frontiers, the weakness of a
small country adrift in the world economy and, above all, the vigour
and aggressiveness of the neighbouring United States, have induced
Canadian governments to take direct responsibility for economic de¬
velopment, primarily but not exclusively through seeing to the con¬
struction of canals and railways.

Suspicion of laissez faire does not lead necessarily to support of a
national economy protected by tariffs; until the 1840s, it led mostly to
support of the colonial system. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out
###### that there was already in Canada some experience of fairly self-suffi¬
cient local economy: the little economies of the village, and a broader
local economy in western Upper Canada. Canadians had also an
acquaintance with the self-sufficiency of wartime. Then, with a
substantial proportion of them drawn from the United States, Cana¬
dians had knowledge of and shared in the tradition of those vigorous
seaboard colonies that had diversified themselves, partly by deliberate
policy, even in the eighteenth century. New England had been aided to
self-sufficiency by neglect and by failure to find a staple. As well, di¬
versification was encouraged in most of the American colonies by their
chronic shortage of sterling exchange, which provided them with a pro¬
tective differential of about 10 per cent discount on local currency, in
addition to any other protection.59 Monetary stimulation of local indus¬
###### try became a deliberate policy when several colonies, to counteract
depression, resorted to increases of their local money supplies. The


-----

###### storing prosperity informs us that the colonies were already broadly
developed.60 An instructive contrast is provided by the history of New
France which, though not without diversification, evidently still had
too narrow and torpid an economy to find ready substitutes for im¬
###### ports, so that the attempt to meet the problems of the colony in the
1740s and 1750s by issues of paper money only led to an inflationary
chaos.61 The Americans gained further experience in self-sufficiency
in their Revolutionary War. An early fruit of their independence was
the promotion of manufactures in the interests of national security
and prosperity.62 New American manufactures not infrequently suc¬
cumbed to British competition in peacetime. Nevertheless, the con¬
ception of an economy making its own employment, prosperity and
development secure by local exchanges was familiar to Americans,
and to Canadians, at the beginning of the nineteenth century.

It has been pointed out that Papineau, the reform leader in Lower
Canada, favoured a protective tariff as a weapon against the colonial
office,63 and there was always some volume of protectionist sentiment
in Lower Canada from his time, at least. However, Upper Canada was
the heartland of Canadian protection: the early security of its farmers
against the need to export has been noted elsewhere, and they consis¬
tently sought protection against the American agricultural produce
###### that could weaken or destroy their advantage. They scored occasional
victories, too, when tariffs were imposed on American products in
1822 and 1843; though Fowke regards these as tactical manoeuvres
in the war between farmers and merchants which merchants always
won.64 Objection to any measure that would make American imports
more competitive with Canadian products was also a reason why
###### farmers opposed state expenditure on trunk canals.65 In the 1820s,
William Lyon Mackenzie was inspired by the American, Mathew Carey,
to advocate a protected and diversified Canadian economy in which
###### farmers could dispose of their surpluses safely to a local manufacturing
population, and draw their supplies from it, without economic or politi¬
cal dependence on Britain.66 Mackenzie would seem to have repre¬
sented his constituency more accurately then, and certainly was more
popular than in the 1830s, when he was more or less converted to free
trade, not by any intellectual merit of the doctrine but because he
###### thought this a means of combatting the colonial office and the progress
of class differentiation in Canada.67 Whatever the influence of Mac¬
kenzie, most Canadian farmers were protectionists throughout the
###### nineteenth century, though Fowke has suggested that fervour slack¬
ened after 185 0.68 The address of President William Ferguson to the
Provincial Agricultural Association in 1858 may serve to illustrate the
###### sentiments circulated in the period. His speech was a plea for political


-----

only for protection of hemp, tobadco and flax (which he thought could
produce homespun linen as a good substitute for imported cottons),
but also for the protection of industrial products. The province could
already be proud, he said, of such industrial products as its fine farm
implements and locomotives. With Canada's "inexhaustible water
power", nothing but protection was needed to build native industry.
The leadership currently enjoyed in the world by Britain and New
England was the result of the long period during which they had pro¬
tected their manufactures. Local manufactures would retain those
artisan immigrants who did not wish to farm and who would otherwise
be lost to the United States.69 These views, which seem typical enough,
were bound to be opposed vigorously by the mercantile interest, but
they provided an obvious basis for alliance between farmers and indus¬
trial producers.

The protectionism of industrial producers was the really strategic
element in creating a political framework congenial to development in
Canada. The industrial population was not outstandingly numerous
or powerful, but it — along with smaller interests that sought protec¬
tion, like lake shippers70 — could affect the balance between a pro¬
tectionist agriculture and a mercantile interest devoted to the
maximization of external trade. Again, the protection of manufactures
could produce what protection of agriculture could not, a sufficiently
diversified economy to permit an independent development. Industrial
protection occupied a strategic position at mid-century, finally, because
new transport facilities had established the possibility of the home
market economy which it implied, and Britain's acceptance of free
trade whetted public demand for such an economy.

Agitation for the protection of manufactures was desultory until
the 1840s,71 and the question of protection for industry does not
appear to have been discussed much in the 1820s and 1830s. This situ¬
ation cannot be accounted for by lack of an industrial interest; for,
while Canada did not have many large industrial establishments, it
had a substantial body of handicraft "manufacturers", along with an-
abundance of grist, saw and carding mills, and tanneries. The reason
for silence is, rather, that Canadian manufactures enjoyed substantial
protection from American competition throughout these decades:
###### under a bewildering succession of legislation, American manufactures
were nearly always either excluded or charged about 30 per cent
duty.72 That there was hardly any protection against British manu¬
factures does not seem to have occasioned complaint. Tact and accep¬
tance of the mutual preferences of the colonial system may be the
explanation for this. What the documents suggest, however, is that in


-----

not fear British competition but greatly feared American competition
This may follow from the peculiarity of British manufactures, that
while Britain was far ahead in some lines, she was behind in others,
and not much concerned about it. Thus, it was a rather common
observation about 1850 that while Britain led the world in heavy
machinery, Americans (and Canadians) excelled in light.73 A similar
specialization seems likely to have prevailed earlier.

It was the decade of the 1840s that produced the first wave of pro¬
tectionism for manufacturers in Canada. There was already an under¬
current of agitation at the beginning of the decade — for specific
rather than the ad valorem duties that allowed evasion, and against the
rising competition of Michigan lumber.74 However, vigorous agita¬
tion was set off by some drastic changes in legislation. In 1842, an
imperial act reduced sharply the tariff rates applying on foreign
manufactures imported into Canada. There was also an improved pre¬
ference on Canadian wheat, made still better when Canada imposed a
duty of 3 shillings per quarter on wheat imported from the United
States. But Canadian farmers, at a peak of protectionist agitation,
were far from satisfied with this measure on behalf of the mercantile
interests and induced the Legislature in 1843 to impose substantial
duties on a wide range of American agricultural products.75 These
measures brought industrial producers into full voice.

Canada's numerous producers of leather and shoes took the lead in
this agitation. In 1842 and 1843, those of Montreal and Kingston
stressed their sufferings from American competition and did not fail
to point out that American producers enjoyed a prohibitive protection
in their own market.75 In 1844 and 1845, the shoemakers of Belleville
and Kingston took up the issue, emphasizing this time that farmers
now had 30 per cent tariff protection on their products, and that leather
producers also should have their traditional 30 per cent defence.77
Meanwhile, better protection was being demanded also for lumber pro¬
ducts and iron products.78 Petitioners did not point only to the low level
of duties on American goods, but also to the frequent evasions through
ad valorem duties, carelessness and contraband trade.79 Agitation was
sufficiently effective to produce Canadian legislation in 1845 that
imposed discriminatory duties on American goods, as well as higher
duties on imports from Britain and lower rates on raw materials.80 The
legislation was modified in 1846 under pressure from the British gov¬
ernment, but it is significant that discriminatory protection was re¬
tained for leather producers, the most vociferous interest.81

Up until this time, arguments for protection had been particular and
traditional, and supporters of it may have been the same. The shock of
free trade in Britain, and the depression of 1847-48 produced a new


-----

try's future and culminated in the sweeping proposals of the British
American League and the Annexationist Manifesto.82 British com¬
plaints against Canadian protection83 not only fell upon unsympathe¬
tic ears but faced a general and sophisticated argument for protection:
Britain's abandonment of the colonial system required a new policy
for Canada. "The existence in British North America of the chief ele¬
ments of Manufacturing Prosperity viz. Cheap Food — Abundance of
Water Power —Great Mineral Wealth — extensive lumber Forests —
Freedom from direct Taxation — and a healthy and invigorating
Climate — point to the encouragement of Domestic Manufactures, as
the most certain means of restoring this Provincial Prosperity...'
However, as long as the United States had high tariffs, capital would
not invest in Canada unless Canada was protected too. Therefore,
Canada should have tariffs equal to those of the United States.84 This
position, rounded out by a more concrete conception of the home
market, was to be the basis of protectionist sentiment — the dominant
sentiment — in succeeding years.

Agitation for protection was usually louder in English Canada than
French. However, in spite of this and Lord Elgin's sneer about the
"British party", protection was not at all the sole prerogative of the
English-speaking, even in the 1840s. But French support for protec¬
tion had fluctuated, or appeared to fluctuate, in intensity. The root of
this apparent instability lies in the fact that the French problem —
how to retain and provide for a rapidly-growing population sunk deep
in an unprogressive agriculture, with holdings too small and soils ex¬
###### hausted— seemed to Church authorities to be susceptible of several
solutions, of which industrialization was not the preferred one.85 The
actual solution of the problem in the nineteenth century was emigra¬
tion; but emigration was considered to be undesirable, so that agita¬
tion for other measures, especially protection, rose and fell with the
flow of emigrants. The solution favoured by the Church was "anti¬
luxury": the acceptance of a lower standard of living so that more
people could survive in peasant agriculture.86 This program was ignor¬
ed by the habitants, and it could only have postponed collapse and
made it spectacular when it came. Colonization was the only solution
approved by all elements of French-Canadian nationalism (except,
perhaps, the colonists). Settlement of the surplus population on new
lands expanded the economy, yet retained the peasant structure de¬
sired by the Church, and had therefore been prominent in popular
agitation and provincial policy since the 1840s.87 It did not, however,
much reduce the congestion of population on the old lands. Indus¬
trialization, the remaining alternative, had been viewed with some sus¬
picion, but was preferred to emigration, and received strong support


-----

It is no accident, therefore, that the clearest expression of French-
Canadian protectionism in the 1840s comes in the Report of that
###### Committee of the Assembly charged with discovering "the Causes
and Importance" of emigration from Lower Canada to the United
States. The Committee and its witnesses, many of them priests, re¬
jected French-Canadian nationalist attitudes, including the uncertain¬
ty about method. There was no dispute that emigration had already
reached alarming proportions. But the major proposals, referring
vaguely to public opinion and education, amounted to an acceptance
of the clerical prescription that habitants should be persuaded to stay
in Canada at a lower standard of living, rather than seek relief in the
United States.88 However, some of the priests who testified, anxious
for the development of manufactures to keep their flocks at home,
denounced the seigneurs who, they said, refused to develop the water¬
power sites which they owned.8* And the Committee's Report came
###### out strongly in favour of tariff protection for the benefit of local indus¬ try and the promotion -of further manufacturing. "Your Committee
cannot, no more than Your Honourable House, be blind to the fact
###### that Lower Canada, by its geographical position, its wants, its natural
advantages, is destined, as well as the Northern States... to become a
###### great manufacturing country."90

The home market economy and protection gained support simulta¬
neously from another direction, the considerable economic develop¬
###### ment of the 1840s. Development was promoted by population growth
and the advance of technology in the world, by the particular stimulus
of a mining boom north of Lake Huron94 and, above all, by canals. In
the first place, canals tied the market together. Secondly, waterpower
sites suitable for mills were a by-product of their construction. In
addition, the imported capital spent on construction provided funds,
indirectly, to finance manufactures.92

The Canadian government was anxious to develop industries at the
###### power sites along its canals to begin with in order to recover part of
the costs of the canals in rentals.98 But if this desire did not arise in a
###### context of general development, it very soon acquired that context.94
The industries established were predominantly of the older sort, grist
and saw and carding mills; but there were also paper mills, a mill for
###### treating copper,98 the "Thorold Cotton Manufactory", as well as a
"formes de souliers" factory, a "metier a tisser", a "metier a filer" and
###### "other machines".96 What the industrially-minded hoped for is indi¬
cated in Samuel Keefer s report of 1847. Keefer was impressed with
###### the possibility of making the Welland Canal area a centre of cotton manufacturing:


-----

would, no doubt, bring cotton and other manufactures along
this Canal into successful competition in the western markets,
with the fabrics of the Eastern States, because we enjoy the ad¬
vantage of being situated so much nearer to the farmer. Raw Cot¬
ton is now beginning to be forwarded to the New England facto¬
ries via Buffalo, and if it be found an advantage to them to obtain
it by this route, certainly this District ought to benefit by the dif¬
ference of the double transportation.97

Keefer had in mind to end "the draught of our money to the other
side". His earnestness is indicated by the fact that it was a Keefer
who headed Upper Canada's first cotton mill at Thorold.98 Lower
Canada's first cotton mill, built near Chambly in 1844, seems likely to
have been located with reference to the Chambly Canal.99 And at
Montreal, the Lachine Canal was described by W.H. Merritt, Chief
Commissioner of the Board of Works, as the most important part of
the canal system for manufactures in 1851.100 It supported, in partic¬
ular, very large flour mills of advanced design.101

Finally, the canals supported development in still another way,
###### through the debt which the province had accumulated in building
them. It was stated in 1849 that £3 millions had so far been spent on
canals, with another £95,000 still required to complete them; and the
outstanding debt of the province in July 1850 was £4,242,263.102 The
level of duties on imports required to carry this burden, taking into
account that the canals were far short of being self-supporting and
###### that direct taxation was considered to be impossible to impose, in¬
vited and even necessitated that "incidental protection" that was to
come into prominence a decade later.

The 1840s had produced a substantial industrial population with a
vested interest in protection, inclined to seize the initiative from
agricultural protectionists, destined to grow and to strengthen its
protectionist sentiment. And it did so until, by 1877, it could topple
the citadels of vested mercantile interest, the Boards of Trade of
###### Toronto and Montreal.103 By 1850, there was also a vigorous public
movement for protection that commanded the assent not of the most
powerful, but probably of a good majority of citizens. This movement
was supplied with a coherent doctrine that appealed, as free trade did,
to principles; it could also draw its argument, as free trade could not,
from historical examples, the contemporary difficulties of Canada and
the contrasting prosperity of the United States. But it was the decade
of the 1850s that consolidated these forces to provide what Canada
lacked in 1850 in spite of its considerable diversification — a real home
market economy. The primary agent of this change was the railway
###### that penetrated the backwoods, wove a fabric of crossing economic


-----

###### together as canals never could. It was upon the basis of this market,
and to a great extent with capital supplied directly or indirectly by
railway construction, that Canadian manufactures came of age. Also
###### important, however, were the prosperity of the early 1850s and the
opening of the American market to Canada's natural products by the
Reciprocity Treaty. In another context, these might have produced
the different result that many expected: a willing reversion to the
production of food and wood for export, with manufactures left to
###### others. Canadians used them, in fact, as a guard or breathing space
while they rounded out their home market economy. Faith in the
gospel of development; suspicion of unreliable foreign markets,
###### heightened once more by the decline of prosperity after 1854; the
growing fixed investment in factories, homes and cities, and in canals
and railways — all hostages to the fortunes of the local economy; the
fiscal problems of a government that had committed itself long ago to
development: all worked to produce this result.

The 1850s contributed another vital change: the maturing of the
labour market. Speakers were inclined, at this time, to put great stress
on Canada s resources of water power, in the apparent belief that
###### manufactures swung on this fulcrum alone. It is true that, somewhere
among the details of their exposition, they remarked broadly and
loosely upon the great untapped reserves of labour in Canada. These
reserves did exist. Surpluses of totally unemployed persons, as well as
masses of partially employed, appeared in Lower Canada from early in
the nineteenth century, at least.104 It was characteristic of extractive
###### industries to demand active male labour, to the neglect of women,
children and older men. Agriculture, freehold as well as feudal, con¬
tained an immense potential of labour time that went unused in
winter. The more sophisticated, acquainted with classical economic
###### thought, might ground their argument for protection in labour sur¬
pluses, rather than water surpluses. The editors of the Canadian Al¬
manac of 1859, drawing the conclusion from the depression of 1857
###### that Canada should seek relief in more home manufacture of wool, cotton and iron, observed, "There is a large amount of waste labour in
the country [Upper Canada] which could be cheaply secured if con¬
###### stant employment was given."105 In fact, as the same Almanac pointed
out, the more abundant labour surpluses of Lower Canada had long
since been directed into a domestic manufacturing industry that still
exported a substantial volume of home-made clothing to Upper
Canada in 1859.

-----

Nevertheless, this labour reserve was not very suitable for the
operation of manufactures, and still less for their initiation. Though
plentiful, and cheap in Lower Canada, the labour was not located in
the best places, it was not available continuously in most cases, and
above all it was unskilled. Even experience in domestic manufactures
was a doubtful asset, for, as many realized, machine production was
making rapid progress in the United States, and Canada would have to
###### resort to machinery too, if she hoped to compete in manufacturing.106
What was required along with machines was skilled labour to plan and
manage, and unskilled labour that was disciplined to be available,
dependable and obedient. In short, as has been argued elsewhere,
Canada needed a mature capitalistic labour market, with, on the one
hand, adequate supplies of skilled workers and an abundance of cheap
unskilled labour, and, on the other hand, the sustained demand for
these workers that would retain them in the market.107 New indus¬
tries in the 1850s rounded out a sufficient demand in the cities, foun¬
ded especially on the regular employment offered by railways. But
rural Canada could scarcely have met it. Rather, as has also been
argued elsewhere, it was a body of British artisans, and a swarm of
###### persistent Irish peasants, who provided that sufficient and always
available supply by which, in the 1850s, Canada achieved its mature
labour market.108 Thus, a critical hurdle to industrialization was sur¬
mounted; subsequent expansion faced limitations of the market, of
capital, of protection, but no serious limitation on account of labour
supply. The contribution of surplus farm labour to this solution of the
labour problem was not significant, even in Upper Canada. Rather, in¬
dustrial growth solved problems for agriculture: first, by providing a
larger and more secure market for farm produce; and, secondly, by
establishing the industrial framework that eventually could, after all,
absorb many of those cast off by agriculture.

In 1852, the Boards of Trade of Montreal and Quebec called for the
protection of domestic manufactures.109 In the same year, the Legis¬
lature supported protection, as did the finance minister, Francis
Hincks. Hincks expressed the view that was becoming common
among educated men in Canada: that laissez faire was the proper
policy in theory, but that the American tariff forced a different policy
in practice on Canada.110 Agitation for protection continued in spite of
— or because of — reciprocity, and in 1855, a Committee of the Legis¬
lature, of which W.H. Merritt was chairman, deplored the large im¬
ports of cotton, woollen and iron goods from the United States, and
the lack of protection for Canadian industry. "Water power with us is


-----

at low prices; and the export of straw hats and bonnets is an evidence at
least of the desire for employment among its inhabitants, which might
be turned to more profitable account."111 Duties were raised to 15 per
cent on manufactures (20 per cent on leather) in 1856.112 However,
hard times brought more urgent demands for protection, and Isaac
Buchanan organized his first "Association for the Promotion of
Canadian Industry" in 1858.113 Tariffs on manufactured goods were
raised to 20 per cent (25 per cent on leather and clothing) in 1858, and
###### there were additional increases in 1859. In this way developed Galt's
"incidental protection" which Porritt pronounced, not without justifi¬
cation, to be "The First National Policy Tariffs".114

"Incidental protection" appears to have been a politically popular
and an economically effective policy. John A. Macdonald reported in
1861, "The success of our Policy in this respect [protection] is already
shown by the numerous manufactories of every description, which
have sprung up in both sections of the Province_We hear of hun¬
dreds of industrious mechanics and artisans combining together to
establish woollen and cotton mills, &c."115

The dangers associated with the American Civil War, and the in¬
creasing evidence of an aggressive American imperialism did nothing
directly to decrease protectionist feeling in Canada.116 However, in
###### preparation for Confederation, there was a reduction of tariffs to 15
per cent in 1866. This provoked new agitation, and the second meeting
of Buchanan's "Association".117 The reduction need not have been
taken so seriously: it was required temporarily to persuade the Mari-
times into Confederation; but few informed persons can have doubted
###### that protection would be renewed at a suitable time.118 Macdonald
campaigned again in 1872 on a platform of protection, and found it
popular; though tariffs were next raised, in fact, by the Liberals in
1874.119 All this precedes the National Policy of 1879, which is still
sometimes proclaimed to be the beginning of deliberate industrializa¬
tion by the aid of protective tariffs in Canada.

To this brief catalogue of events it seems useful to add a short dis¬
cussion of two particular details. The first concerns the role in protec¬
tionist development of a remarkable man, Isaac Buchanan. This may
serve to illuminate the intellectual atmosphere of Canada in the nine¬
###### teenth century. The second concerns the shifting of economic and
political forces in Canada that formed the background of tariff policy.
It is intended to clarify the position of labour.

Isaac Buchanan120 was prominent in Toronto in the 1830s, and then
in Hamilton until the 1870s, as a merchant, railway promoter and
politician. He was also an indefatiguable writer and propagandist. He
was widely acquainted with men and books, was close to a contempo¬


-----

Horace Greeley in the United’ States. However, he was an indepen¬
dent thinker with a well-integrated body of economic ideas, which he
expressed with more lucidity and elegance than most. In Canada in the
###### nineteenth century, he was only surpassed as an economist by John
Rae, and as a leader of popular thought about economic matters by,
perhaps, R.B. Sullivan.

Buchanan's objective was stability and prosperity: "employment for
the people and markets for the produce",121 which he saw as insepa¬
rable complements. He detested free trade, the gold standard and the
instability which he believed they produced. He thought that econo¬
mic harping on the cheapest prices for consumers, while ignoring the
welfare of producers, was stupid and immoral: "the distinctive charac¬
teristic of the people is that they labour — that they are producers, and
have therefore as their main interest more bidders for their labour,
which means more, not less, price for the commoditiy."122 Cheap im¬
ports were less important than sure markets: the public interest lay in
secure exchanges, which were likely also to produce fairer terms of
trade. Buchanan approved of mutually free trade among countries,
and in 1847 proposed a great imperial Zollverein to which all countries
accepting "reciprocal" free trade might be admitted; but he saw no
merit in opening national markets to other countries (in particular the
United States) which would not open theirs in return. Stability was
his goal, and in his time and place it could only be found in a diversified
national economy within which farmers and manufacturers supplied
each other in mutual security. Diversification was desirable, also, to
allow diversification of agriculture, and because "manufacturing em¬
ployment is better paid than agricultural".123 To obtain diversification
and fair terms of trade, protection was required.

Buchanan was well aware that a national economy could not be
made stable if the gold standard was retained. As one who never cea¬
sed to denounce the deflationary policy followed in Britain after the
Napoleonic wars, who had been in New York for the panic of 1837,
and had participated in Sydenham's unsuccessful campaign for a
###### government Bank of Issue in Canada, he distrusted rigid money, and
bankers. His proposal for Canada was a managed paper currency —
management to be supplied essentially by the Legislature. The amount
of issue should be enough to ensure "full employment".124 If this led
to deterioration of the foreign exchange rate, the decline of that rate
would provide a self-correcting mechanism, and appropriate addi¬
tional protection in the meantime.

Buchanan was the Canadian counterpart of Carey and List, and like
###### other protectionist writers, he dealt far more extensively with "eco¬
nomic development" than economists have typically done until very


-----

respects. He was more sympathetic to the workingman than any of
these writers, and perhaps more clearly convinced than most econo¬
mists that economic systems were made for man and not the other
way round. For nearly forty years he supplied the electors of Hamil¬
ton, and the electors of Canada as far as he could manage, with a
###### theory of economic stability that was sophisticated and humane.

In spite of its popularity among farmers and manufacturers, the
survival of protection was kept always in question until the 1870s by a
powerful alliance of trading and railroad interests.* To preserve their
delicate position, manufacturers had to maintain unity among them¬
selves by allowance in the tariff structure for new interests that ap¬
peared from time to time.125 Only with the approach of Confederation
did there come a sharp revision of alliances, based, to begin with, on
general agreement that a period of low tariffs was necessary to get the
Maritimes in.126 Soon after, the prospect of exploiting the new West
appeared. Now protection received for the first time the name of "Na¬
tional Policy" and ceased for the first time to be a national policy.
Policy in earlier times had been directed to the production of a secure
society in which appropriate proportions of farmers and urban wor¬
kers would supply each others' needs without dependence on the
world market. The National Policy of 1879 was one weapon of a
Canadian imperialism. Its purpose was not to make Western Canada
also a participant in a self-contained economy; for the West was fully
expected to sell its staple product in world markets, as it did, and there
appears to have been no regret that the new Canadian structure was
###### thus made more vulnerable and dependent than its predecessor. The
task of the National Policy of 1879 was rather to ensure that unpro¬
tected Western wheat was carried by protected Canadian railroads
and handled by protected Canadian traders, and that the supplies of
the West should come from protected manufacturers, in order that as
much as possible of the gains to be made would be drawn to old
Canada, and not to Britain or the United States. It was this imperial
prospect that brought merchants and railroads suddenly around in the
1870s, so that Eastern Canada spoke with an undivided protectionist
voice.127

This unanimity spelled danger for the labour movement. The new
###### situation promised an expansion of manufactures and richer mono¬
poly positions from which higher wages could be afforded; but it also
freed industrialists from any dependence upon the support of labour

‘The following section outlines Pentland's contribution to the debate on the
nature of the Canadian state in its formative years — what has become known
as the "national question". For a fuller discussion of the debate, see Introduc¬

and from any need, therefore, to offer concessions. It is instructive to
notice that while manufacturers were protected from foreign compe¬
tition in the 1880s and 1890s, workingmen were not and made no pro¬
gress in their efforts to curb the importation of contract labourers and
no significant gain in any other direction.128 When, around 1900, a
new boom promised at last to lift the wages and lower the hours that
had prevailed through the long depression, manufacturers launched a
fierce campaign against unions and made the importation of foreign
labour a communal duty.129

The period before 1880 is quite different. While there was a real
national policy, from 1850 until 1880, both manufacturers and their
workmen believed that their livelihood depended on protection and
###### that protection was always in danger from railroads and merchants. In
consequence, employers and employees relied on each other for sup¬
port and showed each other a marked consideration. Manufacturers
resisted strikes, but rarely with anything like the arrogance and vin¬
dictiveness displayed by railroad officials. Though unions were illegal
combinations in law, George Brown was nearly, if not quite, alone in
his prosecution of them, and nearly unique, also, in his consistent
hostility to their existence. It was with the open support of many em¬
ployers that the printers defied Brown in the strike of 1872, and were
rescued from their predicament by a great upsurge of popular sup¬
port, and the Trades Union Act rushed through Parliament by the
Conservative Party.130

What labour gave in return was an accommodating attitude on most
occasions to employers and consistent support for protection and the
Conservative Party. The wage earners — not least through the Orange
###### Order in Canada West — were a dependable and not insignificant part¬ ner in Macdonald's coalitions.* If workmen had not otherwise been
drawn to the Conservative Party, they would have been persuaded
into it by George Brown. Most provocative of employers, the consis¬
###### tent supporter of everything that would worsen the position of labour
and opponent of anything that might raise it, one whose care for the
common man only began (as it has been said) at the city limits of
Toronto, Brown did more than any other man to cement the alliance
of labour with Conservatism.131

What the prevailing structure of economic and political forces in¬
duced workingmen to think about trade policy and national develop¬
ment may be sufficiently represented by the Secretary's Report to
the Canadian Labour Union in 1874, dealing with the Reciprocity

###### CHAPTER VI
 The Transformation of Canadians

Good land, canals and railways, an adequate supply of labour in the
market, and protection: all did their work of changing Canada into an
integrated economy at the stage of manufactures after 1850. But they
could not do it alone. One more important ingredient was required for
this transition: a transformation of values and attitudes to provide the
"Moral Conditions of Economic Growth".1 It is true that Canada's
European population already manifested in 1800 in a good measure —
far more than many populations now undertaking to make industrial
people of themselves — the conceptions of precise rights and duties,
specialized tasks and exclusive property, those habits of industry,
those propensities to economize, maximize and accumulate, the capa¬
city to take account of a long span of future time, that are required to
###### generate capitalistic progress and operate industrial societies. But it
is equally true that this population was too slothful, immediate, an¬
archic and irregular in its work habits, and too easily seduced by non¬
economic goals and means to goals, to provide very suitable material
for a modern society. To make the material suitable required a com¬
plex and unknowable educative process, conducted largely in the school
of experience with the goad of harsh impersonal penalties for failures.*
Nor was the means to success capable of reduction to a precise dose of
new discipline and new ambition that could be injected, once and for all,
like a coin in a machine. Success was attained rather by an indistinct
and never-completed process of interacting stimulation and response.
Human transformation was bound to be partial, and mostly unplanned,
because men were remaking themselves without much comprehension
or consciousness of it, because deliberate changes sent out other
ripples of subtle, unrecognized adjustments to preserve the tension
and balance of existence, and because the inanimate machinery of pro-

*This remaking of the labour force has become an integral part of the growing


-----

duction to which man had to fit himself could only itself be transformed
bit by bit and year by year. The nature and extent of the changes in
the ways men regarded themselves, conducted themselves and dealt
with each other, have therefore to be indicated rather than expounded;
and the direction of causation suspected rather than proved.

Staple production, like factory production or buffalo production,
had particular conditions and demanded its own peculiar labour force.
Staple trades were dominated by the traders, who had commercial
interests and outlooks and were more likely to think of themselves as
middlemen buying cheap and selling dear than as employers directing
production. Fixed investment was kept low. When the trades were
highly competitive, as they often were, the instability of sales and
prices that typified staple markets was accentuated. In fishing, where
the settled nature of the producers made it possible, merchants met
fluctuations by passing on the low returns (but not necessarily the
high returns) to the fisherman. In fur and timber the scale of produc¬
tion required direct employment, and lack of labour reserves forced
employers to assume the overhead costs of their labour forces. Rigid
costs, together with variable returns, put employers in a vulnerable
position for which their main defence was the maintenance of a wage
structure that was customarily low. The conditions of staple produc¬
tion — dispersion of the work force, absence of fixed investment and
the habits of mobility of employers of the mercantile type — made it
extremely difficult for workmen to offer organized resistance to this.
Yet, these workmen could assume a sullen malevolence that made a
persuasive weapon when one of their canons was violated. The first
defence of the employer was that eighteenth-century workmen rarely
used their power of combination to deal in any systematic way with
wages. Pre-industrial employments went along with pre-industrial
workmen, who lacked a discipline appropriate for rebellion as well as
the disposition to rebel over stationary wages, though they might be
provoked by declining ones. Men in the staple trades were not accus¬
tomed to think that their customary standard of living ought to be
improved; and, while they took great pride in personal expertness, they
inclined to regard their work as a very ordinary employment for which
no exceptional wage should be expected. In the same way, agricultural
societies take for granted a familiarity with farm practices, and bodies
of pickers and shovellers suppose that anyone can pick and shovel.
Societies discount the skills that are common among them, and terms
like "unskilled" and "common labour" have no further definition than
commonness.

The fact is, however, that catching fish, chopping and rafting
timber and canoeing after fur each required so intricate a body of


-----

from childhood. They usually demanded also great physical hardiness
and exertion, so that they were only open to adult males in their
prime, and working lives tended to be short. These were shortened, in
any case, by a high incidence of sudden death; hence, another qualifi¬
cation required for these employments was an impassive (but not
casual) attitude towards this prospect. Moreover, the canoeman and
(still more) the lumberman were tied to an existence that was "woman¬
less, homeless, voteless".2 The remote and shifting scene of their em¬
ployments partly accounts for this; but it seems to have been true also,
at least in the case of the lumberman, that wage levels would not have
permitted the maintenance of homes and families — that is, the in¬
dustry developed on the basis of customary wage rates too low to pro¬
vide for reproduction of the labour force, and survived on a subsidy of
manpower drawn from bush farms.* The camaradie of the camps and
the annual spree were hardly an adequate compensation for this root¬
less regimen, which led only to the early discard of a man unsuited
for any employment. The position of the fisherman differed, for he
worked from a stationary base, might continue to do so into old age
and usually had a family. Since, however, his earnings were no more
fit to support a family than the lumberman's, the alternative of abject
poverty was his lot.3

The willingness of the workmen of the staple trades to accept the
conditions of their employments without much complaint is not easily
explicable in terms of pecuniary calculation. Indeed, although these
men were paid money for their work and did many things that indus¬
trial men do, their behaviour was largely the product of considera¬
tions beyond the measures of economic rationality. They were as
disciplined in their way as industrial men, but theirs was a sociable,
extroverted discipline distinct from the cold, methodical routine of
factories. They invented but had no cult of invention. They were effi¬
cient, not from devotion to a religion of capitalism but as a matter of
personal pride. They resisted retrogression, but they did not know
that man must progress. Their choice of occupation was determined
primarily by local custom. The values that kept them to it were famil¬
iarity and excitement. They acquired prestige by exhibitions, not of
accumulation, but of strength and daring. The pattern of their lives
displays an extreme discounting of the future for which the rational
foundation, if there was one, must have been that life in any case is
short. The direction of men like these was handled best by employers
who also felt and understood the pre-industrial values of fellowship,

prowess and tradition. Even late in the nineteenth century, the
lumber boss who could break a log jam, knock a man down and lead a
song, could expect more enthusiastic production than the flabby com¬
petitor whose range of interest was from cover to cover of the account
book. Nevertheless, the future belonged to the latter.4

Fishing continued to vegetate on the Atlantic, and many lumber¬
men pursued their occupation westward to the Pacific, but the old
staples withered away in Canada, and all these attitudes and skills
became obsolescent. The populations that had cradled them had then
to rid themselves of old ways and submit to new disciplines. The
problem was much larger than this, however: the whole Canadian
population was required to abandon the sociable, traditional, leisurely
ways that had marked the age of staple production, and to adopt a
grimmer discipline, to pursue change instead of stability, as they made
an industrial society.

While Canada suffered losses in its economic development from the
devaluation of its own obsolete skills, it was assisted by an enormous
subsidy of imported skill brought by British artisans and professional
men. These were the finished products of the most advanced school of
industrial capitalism in the world. The pain of transition had all been
suffered, and the cost of training had all been paid for, in another
country. Immigrant artisans came prepared to put their abilities to use
immediately; and, because the British labour market was usually
congested, they came readily and at reasonable rates. Canada was
exporting skilled persons, too, especially to the woods of Michigan and
the farmland of the Middle West; but she probably realized a net
advantage of the exchange and certainly enjoyed a very large advan¬
tage as far as the movement of industrial skills is concerned. It was
thus made almost as easy for Canada to develop industrially as for the
United States to acquire canals and railways. In the ruthless description
of R.B. Sullivan: "the greatest part of the money which paid for these
improvements... came from London, and the labourers who made
them from Ireland, leaving to America the very easy task of employing
other people with other peoples' money."5 In Canada, too, it was
British money that paid for the railways, Irish who built them and
British workmen who serviced them — indeed, the British were all too
willing to provide as well the doubtful benefit of British railway
managers. In the case of Canada's manufactures, capital and direction
were supplied mostly by Canadians;* but, again, supplies of skilled

workmen were drawn very largely from the stream of British immi¬
grants. Easy acquisition of a body of workmen who were skilled in
industrial arts and prepared emotionally for the impersonal discipline
and exclusively pecuniary criteria of industrial capitalism, allowed a
great saving in time and cost.6 Nor was this advantage limited to the
sum of the economies realized in various particular branches of indus¬
try. It was a still greater benefit that ready availability of skill lifted the
economy over the hurdles that lie in the way of any country that seeks
a new economic direction and a new structure. Economic progress is
fraught with dangers that the implements required for a mecha¬
nized agriculture, or the iron to make the implements, or houses to
shelter the ironworkers, or food to feed them, will not appear at the
right time, so that the whole transformation is halted for a while in a
round of interdependent stalemates. The great solvent that saved
Canada from any serious acquaintance with this problem was an
indefinitely expansible supply of diverse skills. Its stalemated situa¬
tions appeared, but they came from other directions.

A key problem was thus disposed of by the immigration of British
artisans who were already seasoned members of an industrial capital¬
ist society. There was still the necessity for the mass of native Cana¬
dians, and for a large segment of immigrants — in particular, the Irish
who crowded the market for unskilled labour—to be made over. Mak¬
ing modern men involved a general reorientation by which new ap¬
proaches and outlooks were acquired. It required also a special educa¬
tion of workers and employers in the relationships appropriate to
wage employment under the conditions of industrial capitalism.

###### The New Cosmos

The dissemination of a "modern" outlook on life is apparent in Canada
in the 1830s, becomes a powerful and even engulfing movement in the
1840s and is largely an accomplished fact in the 1850s. Its stock in
trade was built around concepts like progress, "science" and inven¬
tion, but it involved as well a new, sentimental humanitarianism
whose rationale must be pursued deep into the unconscious. The new
precepts were sometimes expressed in religious terms and fostered by
religious movements, but the new cosmic view was a secular one,
sometimes conveniently described as "the spirit of capitalism".

The campaign of the 1830s and 1840s was, in the first place, that of
the privileged classes to convert themselves, with professional and
some business groups in the vanguard. Conversion of the lower
classes, by example, instruction and force, was not neglected even in
the 1830s; but this was not the strategic evolution, and it was one that

selves from was a pre-industrial conception of social structure and
social goals. For example, it was common even in the 1830s for men to
talk as if the world was still made up of “masters” and “servants”, a
notion derived from a rural society, and a British rural society at that.
###### On the same basis, "respectability" rather than competence was the
foundation of social approval and public advancement until about 1840.
How this conceptual framework obstructed the future, and was chal¬
lenged by it, can be illustrated by a controversy about education that
happened to take place in Nova Scotia, but may serve, nevertheless, to
illuminate a Canadian problem.* In 1817, new ideas had spread suffi¬
ciently in Nova Scotia that many were prepared to make better public
provision for the education of lower classes. There was a storm of
opposition, however, on the grounds that education was unsuited to
and undesirable for the lower classes; that it was unnecessary for their
manual work and would make them discontented with it; that all they
needed to know was how to read the Bible; that, if there was to be edu¬
cation of the lower classes, its purpose should be to attach them to
church and state; and so forth.7 About the same time, the members of
the Legislative Council of Lower Canada were demonstrating what
###### they thought of any display of initiative or self-improvement among
the working classes. These had sought incorporation of the Friendly
and Benevolent Society of Mechanics of Quebec, (later. The Friendly
Society of Quebec) a mutual benefit society formed in 1810 that en¬
joyed the approval of some part of the upper classes and certainly of the
Legislature. From 1812 to 1821 the incorporation was consistently
###### obstructed by the Legislative Council, perhaps from the same terror of
ideas that gripped the British ruling classes at that time, but not with¬
###### out the advice that friendly societies were a commonplace in Great
Britain. In 1812 the Council proposed, among other disabilities, that a
Justice of the Peace or Sheriff might attend any meeting of the Society,
with power to disperse the meeting if any other subject than the
business of the Society was raised.8 In 1821, the Legislative Council
still considered that institutions whereby "a numerous assemblage of
persons may be convened, ought not to be made permanent in the first
instance, in a country wherein there has been no experience to demon¬
###### strate their effects."9

New ideas and methods were to appear within a decade of this,
however, and to gather support quickly. One index of the change is
the expansion of public aid in the education of the masses until there
was general provision for free schooling in 1852. Another and a very
sensitive index is the progress of temperance movements. These ori-

ginated among business and professional groups in the cities, the first
###### stratum to subscribe to the goals of efficiency and economy implicit in
capitalism. Hartz found that the temperance movement in Pennsyl¬
vania consisted largely of the effort of these groups, and of industrial
employers in particular, to impose abstinence upon recalcitrant
workers and backwoods farmers who had no ready market for their
grain.10 The Canadian temperance movement, to which some discus¬
sion has already been devoted, followed much the same pattern. In
1810, the pre-industrial device of using liquor to hold and stimulate
workers, and to discount their wages, was still in widespread use. In
the 1840s and 1850s, with the advantage of a labour supply that was
more than sufficient to meet demand, employers strove to force
industry and sobriety on the labour force. Parallel demonstrations of
new attitudes were the prison reform movement, which was also
discussed earlier, and the movement against slavery anywhere — an
importation into Canada from the more advanced British Isles in the
1830s and 1840s, but a native phenomenon in the more capitalistic
1850s and 1860s. The proliferation of literary and scientific societies, a
sign of the increased interest of the privileged classes in natural
science and in self-improvement, is another aspect of the evolution in
progress. However, no developments were more germane to the new
age, or more in accord with its spirit, than the rise of Mechanics'
###### Institutes and the progress of inventions. Some detail is therefore
provided about them.

Mechanics' Institutes Mechanics' Institutes originated in Great Britain,
apparently around Glasgow, shortly after 1800. They spread rapidly,
particularly through the efforts of British philanthropist. Dr. George
Birkbeck, and a London Institute was established in 1823. The object
of the Institutes was to facilitate the self-education of workingmen in
technical and scientific matters by making available books, apparatus
and lectures that would otherwise be beyond their reach. The Insti¬
###### tutes thus presuppose the importance of science and invention and
the desirability of wage earners' becoming familiar with new technical
processes. Hence, the spread of Mechanics' Institutes provides an
index of the diffusion of belief in progress and of industrial ambition.

A Montreal Mechanics' Institute was established in 1828 and was
probably the first in Canada.11 Institutes were established in Quebec
and Toronto in 1831, and the Halifax Institutes opened in 1832. As
the movement spread. Institutes appeared in the 1840s in Dundas,
Peterboro, Niagara and Carleton Place, and in the 1850s, in such
places as Goderich, Port Hope, Paris and Owen's Sound.12 This proli¬
feration is not entirely trustworthy evidence of the spread of belief in

###### government grant for the local Institute also played a part. However, grants seem to have been given sparingly and probably inconsistently.
Thus, the Brantford Institute, in compalining that the London Insti¬
###### tute had been voted a grant in 1848 whereas it had not, pointed out that it (the Brantford Institute) had existed since 1836, and implied that it had never received help in the interval.13 Applications for aid,
indeed, seem to have been pretty regularly refused. Credit for much
###### honest interest in scientific education must be given, therefore, and
the Institutes must surely have enhanced that interest.

The Institutes were everywhere started and dominated by "leading
citizens", and it does not appear that genuine mechanics ever had
much voice in their operations. Nor do mechanics appear very often to
have patronized the Institutes or profited by them.* The Institutes
###### rather provided a means for the local upper classes to conduct a rather dilettantish investigation of the new intellectual atmosphere. But this,
in itself, was important, and there were exceptions. It was asserted in
1841 that a "large majority" of the 350 members of the Kingston In¬
###### stitute were "mechanics and apprentices" and that lectures were frequent.14 When the Montreal Institute was reorganized in 1840,
because "increased commercial and industrial activity indicated anew
the need for adequate training in the practical sciences", it provided
###### not only day classes in academic and technical subjects for the sons of
members, but similar night classes for "the apprentices and workmen
employed in the city's various industrial enterprises". It was reported
###### that the night classes (not the day classes) showed great zeal, and they
were continued for thirty years.15

It may be doubted, nevertheless, that the Institutes are significant
###### primarily for their educational work or for the public libraries that stemmed from them. What their establishment did demonstrate was the outlook and ambition of the business and professional groups that sponsored them. The objects of the sponsors were sometimes made quite explicit. Thus, Joseph Howe, in opening the Halifax Institute in
1832, expected that it would promote the growth of manufactures
and permit Nova Scotia to catch up with the United States. He attribu¬
ted American success in manufacturing, in part, to the prevalence of
###### Institutes there.16 Similarly, it was said on behalf of the Montreal Institute that "the world was then rapidly being industrialized; impor¬ tant technical inventions were being given practical application. The pioneering work of the Institute at that time thus became a vital factor
in promoting the progress and prosperity of Montreal."17 If the ambi¬
###### tions admitted are somewhat earth-bound, they do bespeak a respect

for science, invention and skilled labour as the means to attain worldly
success.

Patents of Invention18 The flow of applications for patents also provides
evidence of the rise of faith in mechanical inventions. Applications
came usually from English-speaking craftsmen, and while they often
###### represented ideas imported or borrowed from abroad, a substantial number seem to have been original.

So far as can be judged from the records, the first spate of inventing
came between 1831 and 1836. Towards the end of this period, patents
were being sought at about the rate of one per month. Applications
resumed and became more numerous in the 1840s, until they aver¬
aged about two per month. Some of the applications dealt with tradi¬
tional devices — an improved stove was, understandably, a great
favourite. However, most inventors proposed either to improve
mechanical devices of fairly recent origin or to apply machinery to
work hitherto done by other means. Thus, some planned to improve
waterwheels (turbines) or ships' paddles (propellers) or to build better
steam engines; while others offered machines for grinding clay, for
making bricks or for drilling rock. Most numerous were machines
designed for an expanding, commercialized agriculture — this was the
age of Fanning Mills and Mechanical Reapers, of the "Metallic Coil
Spring Tooth Horse Rake", the "Horse Threshing Machine", and of a
new implement, the "Cultivator". Nor did these machines exist only
on paper: in this age of individual enterprise, there were more village
mechanics turning out machines, with a fine indifference to patent
rights, than ever thought of applying for a monopoly.19

What the Mechanics' Institutes tell about the privileged classes, the
inventions tell about more humble men. Their absence from the Insti¬
###### tute lectures did not signify, after all, that they lacked interest in
science, but only that they preferred practical experiment in a familiar
environment. It was the tinkering craftsman, more than anyone else,
who brought machinery inside the range of knowledge of ordinary
workers and farmers, and taught loving care of it. The fruit of their
labour was a machine-minded society by the 1850s, at least in the
English-speaking parts of Canada.

The New Labour Relations

The conditions of production in Canada's industrial sector developed
in sharp contrast to those of the staple trades. Manufacturing opera¬
tions tended to be continuous, not seasonal, and output was directed
to the home rather than an export market. Variations in demand were


-----

diversified, so that regularity of operations could be approached from
two directions. Investment in fixed capital was a larger proportion of
total capital in manufactures and transport than it had been in the
staple trades, and tended to become the dominant portion, with the
consequence that increasing overhead costs provided employers with
an additional motive for stabilizing activity. Moreover, investors of
industrial capital were more likely to be real organizers of production
and directors of the labour force, more directly and continuously
concerned with their ventures, than their mercantile predecessors
had been. For all these reasons, industrialization was marked by a
###### great advance towards stability.

At the same time, production became more economical in a real
sense, not only because labour and capital were used more contin-
nuously, but because the multiplication of employers in the cities
raised an aggregate demand for labour that was relatively large and
dependable.20 This allowed surplus workmen to await employment in
the market with some confidence; and with their presence, a rationa¬
lized labour market could develop. A permanent reserve, even if
modest in size, assured employers that they need hire labour only
###### when they wanted it, yet still have their most capricious demands met.
Individual employers could thus free themselves of labour's overhead
costs, which became the responsibility of the whole market and of the
whole society. The net effect was a more economical use of labour,
achieved by the consolidation of previously individual reserves. Its
price was that the relationships between particular employers and
###### their employees were loosened, made transitory and increasingly
impersonal.

The effects of the change to industrial production upon workmen
were both beneficial and the reverse. The more continuous and
economic use of labour; the more generous combination of capital
with it; the reliance on a steadier market: all worked to raise very
sharply the annual productivity of labour, so that employers had the
capacity to pay higher annual wage bills to workers than in staple
production. It was the more likely that larger amounts would, in fact,
be paid, in that continuous operations involved a continuous succes¬
sion of paydays — a circumstance beneficial to workmen on other
###### grounds as well. Again, the employers' heavy fixed investments pro¬
vided the workmen with a certain guarantee of permanence of
employment and a certain leverage in disputes; though, on the other
hand, the employers' anxiety to increase their fixed capital furnished
the main justification for diverting as much as possible of the returns
away from labour. Stable employment and regular incomes also
allowed wage earners to lead a more settled life, which was typically a


-----

family life.* As a stable resident'and family man, the worker took on
some characteristics of a citizen. Eventually he might think it proper
to ask why the town authorities were always drawn from among the
rich, why they legislated in their own interest, and why justice was
administered so unequally as between rich and poor.21

But not all was for the good of the worker. The same rationalization
of production that made possible a higher annual income also made a
capitalistic labour market. Total demand for labour was indeed more
stable than before, but by this very fact, employers no longer had to
make long-term commitments to particular workmen, and individual
security was less. There were various other ambiguous novelties.
Thus, though the security of particular employments declined, the
chance of finding an alternative employer increased. Again, families
weakened the workmen's mobility and bargaining power but may
have stimulated them to fight harder for better conditions. However,
the general effect of the rise of the capitalistic labour market, with its
perennial surplus of supply over demand, was to make the bargaining
position of the individual workman much weaker than before. But
some won exemption from this rule also. Favoured by strategic posi¬
tions, they built disciplined combinations upon the common interests
of their crafts and bargained on more or less equal terms with their
employers.

What, then, did employers and workmen have to learn to fit them¬
selves for industrial capitalism, and how did they learn it? The answer
is not simple, because there was not a single labour force, but sharply
differentiated bodies of skilled and unskilled. The different groups
learned different things, and what employers learned about each of
them differed also.

The skilled workmen, in spite of the conditions of industrial capital¬
ism, and also because of them, occupied a remarkably strong position.
Supply and demand were not likely to get badly out of line in their
trades, because they had some resources and were fairly well informed,
and surplus men were quick to go elsewhere. Besides, there still re¬
mained the option in many trades of setting up a proprietorship. The
British craftsmen who formed the core of the skilled labour force in
the 1850s were mature men, without illusions, and much superior in
this respect to some of their callow employers. The tradition of combi-

nation and exclusion ran deep and strong in the trades, allowing these
men to form tight and highly disciplined units when they were pro¬
voked, which were made more formidable by the strategic position of
the craftsmen in expanding industry, their concentration in urban
centres and the relative weakness of early industrialists. And yet, the
most important advantage of the skilled workmen lay elsewhere, in
###### their indispensability. At the critical moment when industrial devel¬ opment was just getting underway, the artisan was the key man who
held the new technology in his hands and brain, and it was nowhere
else. In the 1850s, there existed no standardized blueprints for build-
ing machines, and each was built by a craftsman to his own design,
with specifications that developed as he went along. There was no
class of technicians outside the crafts, and few employers, who knew
how the work should be done — only the craftsman knew that. The
function of the skilled workers was a vital one, and employers ack¬
nowledged that in their approval of education for the working classes,
###### their support of technical education, and by a good deal of novel talk
about the worth and dignity of labour.22 Labour in the past had been
regarded as a species of draft animal and in the future would be re¬
garded as a type of machinery; but, in the middle of the nineteenth
###### century, skilled labour was an important part of the community. Its
position was all the more secure because employers needed political
###### support against the trading interest.

These circumstances offer an explanation for the fact that while
employers barked at workmen with the ideological cliches of their age,
they did not bite very hard. This was true even while industrialization
was only a premonition, in what may have been the first strike in
Canada for shorter hours by masons in 1823 against the Lachine
Canal Commission. The Commissioners thundered that the custom
of the country was to work from 5 o'clock in the morning until 7
o'clock in the evening; that in a country with so short a summer as
Canada, every hour of daylight must be used; that to concede a twelve-
###### hour day would make workmen believe that "they could dictate to
the Commissioners their own terms, by supposing them at the caprice
and mercy of those so employed."23 Yet, while the workmen did not at
this time obtain shorter hours, they received a substantial increase
in wages.24 After a quarter-century during which skilled workers sel¬
dom found reason to strike, there were again a great many strikes in
the 1850s from about 1852 to 1855. Most employers seem to have
recognized that these were occasioned by a violent increase in the cost
of living, and to have accepted them gracefully or to have denounced
###### them in very perfunctory terms.25 Even the railway companies, no ordinary employers in either strength nor attitude, temporized with


-----

appealing to "supply and demand"; but few others seem to have applied
the doctrine directly in the employment of skilled men, as giving the
employer a unilateral right to determine wages and conditions. Only in
respect to the sewing machine, a device that made skill obsolete, was
there ready agreement that "supply and demand" must prevail.

Skilled workmen, for their part, do not display any very clear philo¬
sophy in such of their statements as are preserved, but their outlook
may be surmised to some extent from their actions. They did not
believe in laissez faire — rather in livelihood — but they accepted the
reality of "supply and demand" to the extent that when labour was
plentiful in relation to demand, they made little complaint. Unrest and
strikes were occasioned most often by increases in the cost of living.
However, the great boom of 1853-55 that raised food prices also made
labour very scarce in relation to demand, so that strikes could be under¬
taken with impunity; and this also must be taken into account. Strikes
could also be provoked by wage cuts, long hours and a replacement
of men by machines. Workers do not seem to have troubled themselves
with the question of whether strikes were legal; and employers and
newspaper editors were also very uncertain on this point, saying fre¬
quently that men were perfectly free to leave their jobs, though they
should not interfere with others' taking them. One reason for not
pursuing the point was that in serious strikes there was no need to
###### arrest workers for conspiracy, because they were soon open to arrest
for assault and damage to property — matters that commanded wider
disapproval and that were more easily prosecuted.27 What workmen
knew, as demonstrated in their actions, was that strikes were won by
keeping work suspended; and they were prepared to take extreme
measures against strike-breakers. Events justified their opinion, on
the whole. On the other hand, workmen were usually prepared to com¬
promise differences with employers. They seem to have had no "ulti¬
mate goals", unless a livelihood at customary wages and under familiar
conditions should be considered one.

Employers and Unskilled Labour

What employers learned about handling unskilled labour, when it was
collected in the armies of labourers that built the canals and railways,
is an entirely different matter, and a contradictory one.

One strong trend was an increasing appeal to the doctrine of the
free (atomistic) market. From about 1830, employers were clearly
conscious of the fact that the old world of scarce labour and paternalis¬
tic relationships was disappearing, and they seem to have considered
this a good thing. They were ready to operate in the new economy of


-----

obtain it; and they declared explicitly that labour was a "commodity"
in the market like any other. Employers often added that the (indivi¬
dual) labourer was equally free to leave their employ, if he found that
advantageous, but that the employer then had the right to replace him
on the best terms he could get.

Considering that there was nearly always a surplus of unskilled
labour available — and employers were aware of this, too —the new
doctrine implied a cold future for labourers. However, the question of
###### their welfare was rarely raised, and then usually to explain (in connec¬
tion with strikes) why the wages paid were sufficient and why higher
ones could not be afforded. Typical enough is "the opinion of the
Board [of Works]... that it [the rate of wages] is already too high, in
###### proportion to the value of agricultural produce —that the price of
labor should be allowed to be regulated solely by the ordinary prin¬
ciples of supply and demand, and that any official interference with it
would be productive of much mischief,''** The fact is that Irish labour¬
ers, at least, came to be regarded as an alien and entirely disposable
###### stratum of society. The Chairman of the Board of Works, Hamilton
Killaly, expressed this view most directly in dismissing the argument
###### that rapid completion of the canals in the 1840s would leave an awk¬
ward unemployment problem afterwards. On the contrary, he said,
the overstock of labourers [is] a floating mass from the States, who,
###### when their services are no longer required, or serviceable to the
province will recross the lines."*9 Thus was jettisoned the old imperial
idea that the state owed some responsibility even to the Irish and
###### ought to encourage them to settle in a British country. The average
employer did not attempt the sweeping analyses of Killaly, but he felt
much the same way about labourers.

The expectation that unskilled labour would find its own, low price
in the market was disappointed from the beginning by the actions of
the labourers, who struck time after time for higher wages, demon¬
###### strated a remarkable determination and power of organization in their
strikes, and not infrequently won their demands. Even when they
lost, strikes entailed trouble and expense for employers, who had
reason to fear also for their lives. It was never made very clear
###### whether employers and government officials considered that laissez
faire encompassed the right of many employees to withdraw their
labour at the same time. Sometimes it was said that they had this
###### right, but were foolish to use it. On the other hand, there were rather
obscure statements about the actions of the workers being illegal, and
strike leaders certainly were considered subject to prosecution, if they
could only be identified. What the employing interest did emphatically
###### assert was that employers had the right to hire replacements for strik¬


-----

to be numerous) who wanted to continue at work. Attempts to resume
operations during a strike nearly always provoked violence, and the
various questions of right dropped into the background as questions
of physical attack came to the fore. The final arbiter of most of the
disputes was not abstract right but physical force: the power of the
massed labourers to do violence against the similar power of the
troops that employers were able to call to their assistance.

In this setting, notions about the atomistic market as the governor
of labour matters were pushed aside in favour of a system of state
intervention. "Labour relations" in the period when canals and rail¬
ways were built meant troops and mounted police to "overawe the
labourers, government spies to learn their intentions, and priests paid
by the government and stationed among the labourers to teach them
meekness. Here was a full program of intervention, immediately on
behalf of contractors, basically to promote economy for the state by
encouraging contractors to make low bids in the expectation that low
wages could be paid, and then enforcing the low wages.

The practice of intervention got underway before laissez faire was
widely favoured and at the direction of a man who believed in it less
###### than most. Colonel John By. By was a paternalistic employer, who
assumed a broad responsibility for the welfare of the men who built
the Rideau Canal, especially in respect to the provision of housing and
medical care.30 He was also dictatorial, not at all prepared to negotiate
with his employees or countenance strikes by them. There were at
least three strikes by the labourers in the spring of 1827 (quite possi¬
bly against a cut in wages from their previous level) and a general aura
of riot.31 Then, in June 1827, the first of By's two companies of
Sappers and Miners arrived from Britain. These appear to have been
raised on the assumption that skilled workers would be scarce on the
Rideau, but the men were not needed or used much for actual con¬
struction. Nevertheless, By said, they were "most usefully employed;
their presence on the ground enables me to check the disorderly
conduct of the Labourers."32 After the troops came there was no more
open rebellion on the Rideau. It looks also as if every official and
employer in Canada knew about and admired the By method of
dealing with labour — in its authoritarian, not its paternalistic, aspects.
For decades afterwards, the first instinct of every contractor who
faced opposition from his labourers was to send for troops; and every
director of a public work dreamed of how, if he only had a few compa¬
nies at his disposal, he could play the role of a Colonel By.

These tendencies were prominently in view when disputes broke
###### out along the Cornwall Canal in the fall of 1834.33 The Canal Com¬
missioners belonged to that middle-class element about to assume


-----

###### ment not very honest, without much sense of responsibility
towards other people and extremely aggressive. They called at once
for troops to be stationed on the works, and thought that they were
going to get them. However, they ran into a check from members of
an older and more aristocratic generation. John Beverley Robinson's
opinion, upheld by the Governor, was that it was open to the contrac¬
tors to negotiate with their men or to hire others, and that it would be
improper to send troops merely to force the labourers to terms; troops
should be used only if they were clearly required to preserve the
peace.34 This view infuriated the Commissioners and it was never
heard again. A second and more permanent check came from another
###### pre-industrial source: the armed forces themselves. From the 1830s to
the 1850s, while troops were regularly used to suppress labourers,
commanding officers were protesting just as regularly that this was
###### not a proper function of the army and that police should replace
them.35 A third check upon instruments of repression was their
expense.

The real formation time of the Canadian system of intervention
was in the 1840s, when the Canadian government strove to complete
its vast canal system, and to spend its loan of one and a quarter million
pounds, in the shortest possible time. Near the beginning in 1842 at
Cornwall and Beauharnois Canals, the government employed
men directly, and another kind of intervention was practised, by
which the directing engineers looked after housing and the general
welfare of the labourers. Under these conditions, it was testified, the
workers were extremely well behaved;36 nevertheless, this successful
###### experiment was not repeated. Instead, nearly the whole of the con¬ struction program was put out to private contractors, in the name of
economy. Economies may well have been achieved, for contractors
appear to have taken work at very low prices. But they had in mind to
recoup themselves by paying as little wages as possible, and, as a
result, the succeeding years were marked by chronic unrest and a
succession of strikes. One of these might involve five thousand men,
whose instinct was direct action; and violence was common against
###### contractors, against strike-breakers, or even by one part of the work
force against another. Moreover, people living near the works had an
###### understandable fear of these masses of sullen and violent men, who
were inclined when they were hard pressed to take what they wanted
###### without asking or paying. The objects of government attempts at sup¬
pression, then, were to keep labourers to their work at low wages and
to pacify local residents.

The first intervention came as an aftermath of the strike at Lachine
in 1843.37 A small force of police was recruited and stationed on the


-----

Beauharnois Canal, a Stipendiary Magistrate with ten men was also
placed there.38 In addition, the Board of Works asked that a small force
of troops be stationed on the Beauharnois Canal,30 and arranged for
"the Special services of a Clergyman" (the Rev. Mr. Falvey) who was
located at the same place "to prevent disturbances there".40 All these
steps were undertaken in haste and were apparently considered to be
temporary measures; but the police forces became relatively perma¬
###### nent institutions, engaged chiefly in gathering information about the
intentions of the labourers,41 while Falvey, "as he had much influence
amongst the Men", was retained for about two years, and perhaps
longer.42

In 1844, another police force was placed on the works at Prescott;43
and in April of that year, in defiance of orders to the contrary, 600
labourers from the Lachine Canal struck work, marched into Mont¬
real for the current elections and ensured the election of their
favoured candidate (Drummond) by surrounding the polling places.44
Nevertheless, and in spite of the annoyance of officials by the election
maneouvre, there was a relaxation of tension in 1844 until another
election occurred in October. Again the labourers entered Montreal
to support their candidate; and a force of about 400 of them, of whom
some had firearms, clashed with a body of cavalry.45 No one was hurt,
and the twenty-seven labourers arrested were freed by a Grand Jury.48
However, the events of this election had thoroughly incensed the
officers of government, and another step of intervention was taken,
based ostensibly on the labourers' possession of firearms.

Some labourers did possess firearms. An engineer had persuaded
the labourers at Beauharnois to turn their weapons over to the
###### government in 1843; but these had been returned in 1844, partly
because there was no legal basis for keeping them.47 These arms had
sometimes been the instruments of bloodshed, and might be so again.
But to take them forcibly from the labourers would be a highly provo¬
cative act, not carried out easily. Here is the background of a legis¬
lative act of March 1845, "for the better preservation of the Peace, and
the prevention of Riots and violent Outrages at and near Public Works
while in progress of construction".48 It provided, first, that firearms
must be registered and that possession of unregistered firearms was
an offence —but only on designated lines of public works. Thus, a
special kind of law was established for labourers, as distinct from any
###### other persons. Secondly, the act authorized "the raising and employ¬
ment of a mounted police force to be stationed at such parts of these
works as may be found necessary... "49 Here is the inspiration of later
mounted police forces. Subsequently, some occasional and mostly


-----

intended, was to place mounted police forces on the chief public
works. Other means of control were not neglected, however; for
troops might still be called for, and additional Roman Catholic priests
were appointed as spiritual agents" to look after the main bodies of
labourers.50 Of these unhappy men, only one dared to turn on his
###### paymasters and denounce the shameless exploitation of his charges.51

Even more instructive than these developments are the changes
###### that occurred in the 1850s, when the main "public works" were
carried out, not by a public agency, but by private railway corpora¬
tions. The Board of Works had paid the piper for police and priests,
and it had called tunes that were only sweet to employers; but it was,
at least, a public agent answerable to the government and the Legis¬
lature. As far as particular contractors, mayors and Justices of the
Peace were concerned, many public officials viewed their demands
with a critical eye, for their ruling-class background endowed them
with a suspicion of shopkeepers and a degree of sympathy for pea¬
sants. When strikes occurred, officials frequently asked what had
caused them; they sometimes denounced the contractors for their
grasping ways; and they supplied troops with reluctance. There were
to be two profound differences in the railway age. First, aided by a
certain confusion in the public mind concerning the status of these
quasi-public agencies, private railway corporations were to assume
the right of the state to keep and direct police forces. Secondly, when
the manager of a large private corporation demanded troops, officials
learned not to ask whether they were needed, but rushed a force off as
soon as possible.

The new order was foreshadowed when the Montreal Mining
Company and the Quebec Mining Company, most important of the
firms produced by the mining boom of 1846, asked for the support of
###### troops at their Lake Huron properties in November 1849. It was
claimed that employees and property were in danger of attack by
armed bodies of Indians and half-breeds, led by a few white men.
Officials reacted to this demand in much the same way as they treated
the plea of an excited Justice of the Peace. In such cases, it was the
custom to say that troops could not be sent unless the danger was real
and immediate, and not merely apprehended. The evidence in the
public record of danger on Lake Huron is no more than shadowy hear¬
say. It was usually said also, though it could not be said in this case,
###### that troops could not be used until the resources of the local civil authorities were exhausted. Finally, it was common enough to say that troops could not be spared from other duties. In the case of the
mining companies' demand, the commander of the forces considered
the logistic problems associated with sending troops into the northern


-----

dais were now to learn something about the power of private
companies that represented substantial wealth. The companies went
directly to the Governor General. They succeeded in so alarming him
###### that he overruled his subordinates and ordered that troops be sent.
Sent they were, to pass a very uncomfortable winter at Sault Ste.
Marie.52

The next step came at the beginning of 1851, when construction of
the Great Western Railway was underway in the vicinity of Hamilton.
Representatives of that city and its environs petitioned the govern¬
###### ment to station troops in Hamilton for their protection. They pointed out that a great number of labourers were congregated there and that
they had already conducted two strikes for higher wages, during
which large bodies of them had marched about armed with clubs, and
###### they asserted that the civil power was incapable of coping with such
groups.53 The government's replies made two points: first, that the
use of police should precede the use of troops, and that Hamilton
###### ought to equip itself with a police force; secondly, that troops could be
sent only if a suitable building for them to occupy was provided.54
Hitherto, local governments usually had dropped their requests at
this point, for they were typically appalled at the thought of paying for
even one policeman. Hamilton, however, was raising a special police
force of 27 men within two months; and within four months, a sui¬
table building had been erected and was occupied by a military force of
80 men.55 All this had been accomplished not only expeditiously, but
smoothly and cheerfully. It was plain that a new force was at work —
the Great Western Railway — and it seems evident, though there is no
document to prove it, that it was the Railway which had undertaken to
pay most or all of the costs of policemen and barracks. And, since
taxation without representation is inequitable, the committee that
governed the new police force included not only the Mayor of Hamil¬
ton and the wardens of local counties, but "a Member of the Rail-Way
Board" as well.56 The Railway's influence is indicated, too, by the alac¬
rity with which the government had sent troops, though there was no
evidence of any challenge to the civil power.57

What was done at Hamilton was legalized and generalized in two
pieces of legislation of August 1851. These, if not drawn by a railway
official, were drawn with an eye to his wants. The first act58 renewed
for three and a half years the act of 1845, which had created "The
Mounted Police Force". There were important modifications, how¬
ever. The provisions for a special kind of law and for special policing
which had hitherto been applicable to canal lines, could now be exten¬
ded to the line of any railway under construction by an incorporated
company. And, just as the Board of Works had been chargeable with


-----

the costs of police in the original act, these costs might now be reco¬
vered from a railway company. A complementary act** was passed at
the same time (for five years) providing for the creation of a force of
up to 500 military pensioners to be used as local police. These men
could be called out, in any desired number, by local mayors and
wardens. Thus, manpower was provided to make the other act effec¬
tive. It was now possible for a railway company, if it could get the
cooperation of a municipal officer and if it would agree to bear the
expense, to place a quasi-private and quasi-military police force at any
point along its line of construction.

Some events of 1853 may illustrate how this legislation could be
used. Construction of the Great Western Railway was then being
carried on actively near London. However, there had been one or
more strikes and some unsuccessful attempts to arrest some of the
labourers for riot meaning, perhaps, that they had threatened or
dealt roughly with strike-breakers. C.J. Brydges, Managing Director
of the Great Western (and later, manager of the Grand Trunk), next
applied to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Middlesex and Elgin to call
###### out a police force. The Court, in view of the Railway's willingness to
bear expenses, was easily persuaded. It applied to the government for
a warrant to call out the force, appending Brydges's statement as a
sufficient reason.60 The provincial government issued the warrant
and sent warrants to several other mayors and wardens at the same
time.61

This was in August 1853. The labourers appear to have been quiet
when the warrant arrived, and nothing was done immediately.
However, the power bestowed by the warrant was used in January
1854, when the Mayor of London called out a force of pensioners "to
aid in the preservation of the peace".62 The dispatch of the officer in
command of this force63 makes it very clear that no disturbance had
occurred and that none seemed to be impending; all that was in prog¬
ress was a peaceful strike a few miles outside London, which the
###### workmen seem to have abandoned when the troops appeared among
them. The officer thought that he should then withdraw, particularly
because he was several miles outside the area in which the govern¬
###### ment's warrant gave him legal authority to act. The Mayor consi¬
dered, however, that it would be best to have troops remain awhile, to
###### prevent "any further interruption".64 In keeping with this view, ten
men were left on the works for several days, in a building provided by
the contractor. Not less significant is the procedure by which the
###### detachment was withdrawn. It was called back after about a week, when the Law Agent and the Chief Engineer of the Great Western
Railway decided that its presence was no longer necessary. However,


-----

also at the recommendation of these officials, some of the men were
retained as special constables under the orders of the Mayor of
London.65

Thus did a doctrine that wages ought to be determined in the mar¬
ket at the lowest rates for which men could be got, lead on to a regime
of intervention, by which the state sought by force to suppress any
resistance to the unilateral determination of wages by employers. The
additional peculiarity of the 1850s was that a new type of employer
had appeared in the railway corporation, that was more powerful than
the state and able to shape the state to meet its wants.66 In keeping
with this shift in power, railways assumed some of the state's prerog¬
ative to dispose of the force. Interventions by the Canadian state on
behalf of employers in more recent years should not be regarded as
novelties, but as fruits of what employers and officials learned about
"labour problems" in the middle of the nineteenth century.

There is the question, finally, of the unskilled Irish labourers, and
###### what they learned. They learned that work was irregular and uncer¬
tain, and rare in the cold winter. They learned that hours were from
five in the morning until seven in the evening, or longer. They learned
###### that wages were usually 50 cents a day, often 40 cents a day, rarely 60
cents a day; that they were paid only after a long period of waiting and
often discounted by store pay. They learned that the provision of
housing on the public works usually consisted of letting the labourers
erect such shelters as they could on waste or swamp land. They
learned that many hundreds of their kind died of disease, especially on
the Rideau and the Welland Canals. They learned that contractors,
officials and most other Canadians only cared to make them work
cheaply, and concerned themselves not at all about their welfare.

They learned that their only protection lay in cohesion among their
own people. They might have learned, but they already knew, how to
conduct effective strikes that depended upon able leadership and
disciplined obedience of the rank and file. Scarcely ever did the labourers
expose their leaders to the knowledge and arrest of the authorities,
and rarely did their ranks break. It is impossible to say how much they
won and lost by their strikes, but they won their demands a good many
times, and the dread in which they were held may have prevented
many impositions. As for their habit of violence, it afforded a number
of short-run advantages. It disposed pretty effectively of the danger
of strike-breaking. It saved many from arrest on charges that were
valid only from an employer viewpoint. It had some point in negotia¬
tions: it was difficult for an employer to say "No" when he was sur¬
rounded by a number of armed ruffians who promised to beat his brains
out In Canada however unlike Ireland the law was not altogether


-----

by physical contests was not widely approved. In the long run, by pro¬
voking repressive measures, violence may have done more harm than
good to the labourers. What might be said for them is that they learned
to be increasingly judicious in their use of it. In the 1830s and even in
t e 1840s, violence appears often as an unconsidered and indiscrimi¬
###### nate response to unfair treatment. By the 1850s, the labourers had
learned to wait, and they used force selectively, when it would do the
most good and the least harm.

###### Another thing the Irish labourers learned was to act less like tribesmen and more like a nationality or class. They had the bad habit
of carrying on civil war among themselves, usually between the Cork
(Munster) and Connaught parties, which may each have included
some other elements. There was a basis for division, not unlike that
###### between skilled and unskilled labour, in the fact that southern Irish
were more advanced, more disciplined and better armed, while
###### Connaught produced the least-taught wild men of the west. There was
a basis, too, in the fact that often there was not enough work for both
parties: then the stronger party sometimes drove the others away in
###### order to monopolize the jobs.67 All the same, this division was a poor preparation for presenting a united front to contractors, and a poor advertisement also for the cause of Ireland, to which all the labourers
appear to have been passionately devoted. The authorities had no liking
for this internecine strife either; for besides the interruptions to work
which it occasioned, it produced the most unpredictable and uncontrol¬
lable of civil disorders. The labourers seem gradually to have overcome
###### their division by what must have been an admirable statesmanship,
and not without what looks like a brilliant contribution to unity, in
1844, by the Rev. McDonough, who was the government's "moral
###### agent" on the Welland Canal.68 At the same time, the Irish were gradu¬
ally assuming a place in the political structure of Canada, little as their
###### contribution to election struggles was welcomed by some.

The labourers were also learning, and helping to form to an extent,
the rules of the game in a capitalistic labour market. Contests about
wages were not new to them, and what they had to learn did not relate
to principle but to the methods of effective combination in Canada.
Store pay, delayed payment of wages and the exactions of money¬
lenders were not very new either; but revolt by the labourers led to a
more prompt payment of wages and avoidance of company stores
along the public works.69 One thing that was obscure to the Irish, and
obscure to anyone else with a different viewpoint from that of the
capitalistic market, was why it was permissible within some limits to
argue about the rate of wages, the hours and some of the conditions of
employment, but never about the quantity of work to be offered,


-----

Sometimes they tried to bargain for the quantity of work to be pro¬
vided— the right quantity being enough to employ all the available
labourers.70 Their approach did not rest only on a pre-industrial
conception of livelihood, though it probably owed something to that.
But the fact is that in large-scale canal and railway construction by
hand methods, the amount of work that might be carried on at any
one time was almost indefinitely expansible. More than that, as the
labourers knew very well, the quantity of canal work offered had
frequently been expanded or contracted for reasons unknown to
economic calculation. For example, the bankrupt province of Upper
Canada had kept work going on the Cornwall Canal in 1837 to mini¬
mize distress and the danger of disturbances.71 In 1844, when the
labourers wanted to take part in elections and officials wanted to
prevent them, the work available had been deliberately expanded at
election time, in order to take up all the available labourers and leave
no excuse of unemployment for their entry into Montreal.72 Then,
when the labourers participated anyway, the Board of Works suspen¬
ded work for a time as a punishment.73 Again, the Board sometimes
closed down a work when the men struck, rather than consider their
demands.74 In view of this flexibility, it should not be surprising that
labourers occasionally tried to stipulate for a sufficient amount of
employment. Their attempts met with no success and seem to have
been abandoned by the 1850s. Evidently the labourers had learned
###### that in the capitalistic market, for whatever reason, common labourers
had no voice in determining the amount of work to be offered them.

The Irish peasants came to Canada as strong and willing labourers,
but men profoundly untutored in the ways of an industrial economy.
They brought many troubles on themselves by their own ignorance
and lack of self-discipline, and many more were thrust upon them as
the predatory and unscrupulous sought to exploit them. But they
contributed much: they did the heavy work, and built the canals and
railways, and made the well-supplied market in common labour that
supported industrial capitalism. They taught much: that there was
not, after all, an atomistic labour market; that beyond a certain point
of exploitation, labourers would combine and revolt; that it was some¬
times necessary to negotiate terms rather than dictate them. They
learned much: that the rules of capitalism allow some discussion of
wages, but none of employment; that unity, to be very effective, had
to encompass all labourers; that life in a capitalistic society demanded
a more calculating, more informed and more disciplined behaviour than
they had been used to. The labourers of the 1850s were pretty rough
still, but they were far more sophisticated than their counterparts of
###### twenty years before and were close to becoming citizens of the modern


-----

world. The next generation proliferated into the diverse employments
o ered by an industrial society, became indistinguishable from anyone
else and made another contribution — to the conformity that seems
to be the price of economic progress.

15 Chief Justice William Smith will serve as an instructive, though scarcely
typical, example. Writing from Quebec to his wife in New York in 1786,
he discussed his numerous hired servants, who altogether would cost
him £100 sterling per year, and then, "the lower servants who, I think,
must be negroes from New York, as cheapest and least likely to find diffi¬
culties .... If you bring blacks from New York with you, let them be such
as you can depend upon. Our table will always want four attendants of
decent appearance." (Quoted in J.M. LeMoine, Picturesque Quebec [Montreal,

The marketing of slaves and indentured servants at Quebec and Mon¬

ment of an Indian girl at Niagara in 1802 (H. Scadding, Toronto of Old: Collec¬
tions and Recollections [Toronto, 1873], p. 295).

22 There is a precise statement of the law in Robert Gourlay, Statistical Account
of Upper Canada..., 3 vols. (London, 1822), vol. I, p. 240. The law also pro-
hitnted indentures of over nine years duration. Evidently it was already
t e tashion in Upper Canada, as elsewhere, to replace slave status with
an indenture for life or for some shorter period (Thomas Conant, Upper
Canada Sketches Toronto, 1898], p. 128). A very odd case appears in Upper
Canada Sundries (P.A.C.), Oct. 10, 1819, the petition of Eve Fry. Eve was the
old (76 years) slave of one Robinson, of Kingston. She had received her
freedom for nine years "slavery". She petitioned on behalf of her female
child who was held by Robinson as a slave "though born free".
22 Canniff, op. cit., p. 576.

23 There is a review of these events in L.A. Paquet, "L'Esclavage au Canada",
Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, section I, 1913, pp. 139-49, but the
clearest record is in the documents and commentary collected in La-
Fontaine and Viger, “De I'esclavage en Canada". Scadding (op. cit., p. 294)
thought that the Lower Canadian courts acted in emulation of Mansfield
in England, who had held slavery to be incompatible with English air. How¬
ever, so far as the Lower Canadian courts pretended to have any legal basis
for their actions, they referred to an imperial act of 1797 which removed
slaves from the list of chattels which could be seized for debt in British
possessions in America (LaFontaine and Viger, op. cit., p. 51). It is significant
also that the Chief Justice who presided over a key case (Osgoode) of 1800
had served previously in Upper Canada (ibid., pp. 62-63).

24 Ida Greaves, The Negro in Canada (Orillia, n.d. [1930]), held (ch. 1) that the
Canadian climate was no more detrimental to negroes than whites. The
facts seem to be on her side, but it is important as well that the question
whether negroes could survive in Canada was the single one raised by
authorities in France when they considered negro importation, both in
1689 and 1721. L.J. Greene, The Negro in Colonial New England (New York,
1942), pp. 224-25, states that the severe climate of New England really was
supported with difficulty by negroes; though this handicap did not prevent
wide use of them there.

25 The employment of slaves as craftsmen in the British Caribbean is noted
in L.J. Ragatz, The Fall of the Planter Class in the British Caribbean, 1763-1833
(New York and London, 1928), p. 25.

26 Greene, The Negro in Colonial New England, pp. 100-123.

27 The figure of "one-third" was put forward too regularly to indicate exact¬
ness. It is found, for example, in I. Finch, Travels in the United States and Canada
(London, 1833), p. 236. Finch describes a most suggestive experiment in
South Carolina, about 1833, by which it was hoped to overcome the in¬
attention of the slaves. The slaves were given individual plots and huts
and told that upon completing a prearranged quota of general field work,
they might devote whatever time was left to their own plots. It is striking
that this case reproduces the problem, and to a large extent, the answer,
that led to the rise of serfdom in the declining years of the Roman Empire.

28 Slaves, the generally available labour supply of the American South, were
used for all sorts of tasks in the eighteenth century. They raised the first
coal mined in the United States, near Richmond, 1750 (McAlister Coleman,
Men and Coal [New York, 1943], p. 4). It was they who dug a canal to extend
the navigation of the James River (Finch, op. cit., p. 263). They were used
extensively in southern ironworks (Carl Bridenbaugh, The Colonial Crafts¬
man [New York and London, 1950], pp. 16-18). Indeed, Bridenbaugh indi¬
cates that in the eighteenth century the dearth of skilled free labour led to
many slaves being trained in some degree as artisans, and that the
tendency then was for these slave artisans to drive their teachers out of
the South. But he makes equally plain how dependent the South often was
upon the availability of genuinely skilled (free) artisans and how anxious
its leading men were to have more of them; and he suggests, what I think
is true, that as free labour became more plentiful in the nineteenth
century, and even allowing that the South never had a large share of it, the
trend in the southern states was against slave artisans and in favour of
free ones (ibid., ch. 1 especially pp. 15, 29-30).

(Cambridge, Mass., 1948). The unsuitability of slavery is noted, p. 181.

30 Earl of Selkirk, Selkirk Papers (P.A.C.), vol. 75, p. 214. It is noted also that
New Yorkers thought slaves to be the worst servants.

31 It has been stated that four negro families were living in the Western
District in 1817 (H.A. Tanser, The Settlement of Negroes in Kent County, Ontario

[Chatham, 1939], pp. 33-34). However, Gourlay's Statistical Account..., which
is very detailed and has a very full coverage of the Western District, fails
to mention negroes (in 1817). Thomas Rolph, Emigration and Colonization...
(London, 1844), p. 313, refers to a petition of the magistrates of the
Western District of 1840 which refers to the negro immigration as occur¬
ring during the five preceding years.

32 A colony near Amherstburgh, dating perhaps from the early 1830s, was
described by the whites as small and orderly. A much larger one, the
"Black Settlement", formed "some years" before 1841, was "well known
to the Coloured people in the U.S. as they have been arriving in consider¬
able numbers lately (June 1841) directly to this place" (P.S.O., C.W.,
1841-3, no. 534). Another colony was established by two missionaries
about the beginning of 1842 (P.S.O., C.W., 1843-4, no. 6214). The Buxton
Settlement, established later, is described in Kent Historical Society, Papers
and Addresses, vol. IV, 1919, pp. 40-44, by W.N. Sexsmith. Tanser, Kent County
Negroes, contains considerable information concerning the Buxton Settle¬
ment, the Dawn Settlement and negro life in Chatham. In the London
District, the Wilberforce Settlement was established in the 1830s; but
"though much has been said about (it), it has never flourished, and is now
inferior to several other settlements" (Rolph, op. cit., p. 311). Rolph's
authority locates a second settlement in the London District in 1843. The
petition of about thirty negroes of St. Catharines who want to buy land
for a colony is found in Upper Canada Sundries, Dec. 20, 1828.

36 W.L Mackenzie estimated the negro population of Upper Canada at
12,510, and that of Lower Canada at 5,100 in 1840 (Mackenzie's Gazette,
Rochester, June 1, 1840, in P.S.O., C.W., 1840-1, no. 1480). Rolph, who
should have had a very good basis for estimation, thought there were
nearly 20,000 negroes in Canada in 1843 (Rolph, op. cit., p. 310). Landon's
estimate of 30,000 to 40,000 negroes in Canada might be appropriate for
the 1850s (Fred Landon, "Social Conditions among the Negroes in Upper

40 Rolph's account would indicate more severe discrimination, if anything, in
1843. From the "strong and unconquerable aversion on the part of the
white inhabitants , he says, the negroes "are excluded from the public
schools; they are appointed to no public situations; they have great diffi¬
culty in obtaining land ..." (Rolph, Migration and Colonization, p. 310). Writers
from the region — i.e., Landon, Tanser — are satisfied to establish that
negroes preferred Canada to the United States, but seem anxious to
minimize the disabilities imposed on them.

57 The difference in wages stands out in wage surveys — see Gourlay,
Statistical Account, vol. I, pp. 610-11. Amusing evidence of the labour
scarcity in the Western District is found in Upper Canada Sundries, Jan. 5,
1828 (North to Hillier). It had been discovered that the officers of the
detachment of troops at Amherstburgh were using their men for family
servants. Their excuse was that it was next to impossible to obtain ser¬
vants of any other kind in the area.

Local labour shortage led to another unusual expedient, the employ¬
ment of Indians. Farmers employed them for harvest work in the years
before 1817 at least (Gourlay, op. cit., p. 297). The military authorities
had found it desirable to hire Indians to repair a schooner and to build a
house and forge at Amherstburgh in 1797. (C105, P.A.C., p. 141).

61 Rolph's great project to transport a large body of Canadian negroes to

of support by the negroes (Rolph, op. cit., pp. 309-19; also P.S.O., C.W.,
1840-1, nos. 3350, 3351). But Rolph spoke familiarly of negroes who
before 1843 had gone to Jamaica and to Trinidad (loc. cit.). There was a
substantial movement of negroes to Haiti in 1861 and at some earlier
period (Camm, The Great Western Railway, p. 96). Landon's statement (op. cit.,
p. 158) that negroes showed no disposition to leave Canada before 1860
is clearly wrong.

1634-1763 (New Haven, 1934), pp. 259-60, describes the very large inden¬
ture traffic from Newfoundland to New England. The practice of sen¬
tencing various kinds of rebels, especially Irish ones, to this form of
slavery, contributed greatly to the rise of the indenture system (Eric
Williams, Capitalism and Slavery [Chapel Hill, 1944], pp. 13-15; George

65 The flexibility of the indenture form, and the fact that persons in America
as well as Europe might feel compelled to indent themselves, is illustrated
by the indenture of one Margret Sellinger (or Zelner) "to learn house
keeping" for eight years and four months. This indenture was undertaken

°6 Contrary to what might be imagined, white slaves received worse treat¬
ment than black ones because they represented a less permanent capital
investment. Williams, op. cit., p. 17, points this out with particular reference
to the Caribbean. In the same way, Greene noted that New Englanders
made little distinction between their black and white slaves, but such
distinction as there was favoured the negroes (The Negro in Colonial New
England, pp. 128, 135, 231-32).

68 Though this seems clear from various sources, including Lord Selkirk's
writings, it is also true that Selkirk thought that nearly all the Irish (i.e.,
wage earners) in New York in 1804 were indentured (Papers vol 75

69 Hansen, op. cit., p. 105.

70 Selkirk, op. cit., p. 105. However, in 1805 Selkirk himself was still using
indentured labour and meeting precisely the same sort of trouble (p. 330).
The unruliness of indentured servants was also discussed by John
Howison, Sketches of Upper Canada (3rd ed., Edinburgh and London, 1825)
p. 274.

72 In the 1830s and 1840s especially, unplaced immigrants are reported far
more often than disappointed employers. However, the assiduous "emi¬
gration" agents could not always discover where labour was wanted. An
employer in an out-of-the-way port, like Oakville (William Chisholm),
found it wise to recruit at the port of entry (Hazel C. Mathews, Oakville
and the Sixteen: The History of an Ontario Port [Toronto, 1953], p. 27).

73 A great many statements to the contrary were made, arguing that labour
could not be plentiful in Canada since wage rates had not been beaten
down to the European level. While distress in Canada did not equal that in
Britain, there were often large numbers of men in the former country
unable to find jobs; and their failure had very little to do — if anything —
with wage rates. Those who expected otherwise were misled by the over¬
simplified model of the labour market propagated by classical economists.
They also took insufficient account of the floor placed under Canadian
wage rates by the nearness of the United States market.

he claimed. Notions much like his seem to have been almost common
property much earlier — they appear, for instance, in Robert Gourlay's
work. With respect to the reversal of the policy of easy land grants in
Canada after 1815, Henry Golbourn was anxious in 1817 to confine land

their employees (C.O. 43, vol. 56* Golbourn to Harrison, Dec. 6, 1817).
There were, of course, often important differences also. Golbourn was
primarily concerned to limit the settlement of "idle persons who having
neither means of maintenance nor energy sufficient to make use of the
Land offered to them are a burthen and a disgrace to [the Colony]."
Gourlay was a single-taxer, while Wakefield emphatically was not.

83 There is an undercurrent in nearly all British discussion of colonization in
this period of what might be called misapplied classical political economy.
With respect to public works, the implicit chain of argument seems to have
been something like this: Public works are capital. Capital is congealed
labour. If labourers (redundant in Britain) are taken to Canada, their labour
can provide the public works. But it is also known that labourers will work
hard to get land. Therefore give them land, a useless asset or free good to
the authorities, in exchange for their labour. Thus, public works can be
provided out of land. A useful analysis of British thinking about colonies at
this time appears in Brinley Thomas, Migration and Economic Growth (Cam¬
bridge, 1954), ch. I.

84 Doughty, Elgin-Grey Papers, vol. IV, pp.1427-36 (Memorandum on Immigra¬
tion and Public Works) and pp. 1436-57 (Tulloch's Plan). The gist of what
the Canadians said was that it was not labour but capital that was short in
Canada; and that if capital were provided, any deficiency of the labour force
would be very rapidly made up by voluntary immigration (i.e., if jobs were
available). In terms of the British argument cited above, the Canadians were
declaring that capital was something distinct from labour in a sense not
made clear in classical value theory. The British had overlooked that while
labour in general makes capital in general, Canada could not be expected
always to have the particular kinds of labour necessary to make the particu¬
lar kinds of capital goods wanted. Nor do they seem to have appreciated
that capital must afford labourers their subsistence while they are produ¬
cing capital goods; and classical political economy certainly gave no warrant
for that omission.

The Canadians also took strong exception to the plans to pay for labour
with land; or more exactly they argued against Wakefield ideas in general.
Land had to be cheap in Canada to compete with the United States, and it
was desirable to have it settled by any means.

88 In 1732, when a rope-making industry was being established in New France,
two rope-makers came of their own accord, along with eight others brought
under contract (Lunn, op. cil., p. 78). But this was a most unusual occurrence

89 The references to skilled labour brought under such contracts are very
numerous (Lunn, Economic Development in New France; Fauteux, Essai sur l'Indus¬
trie au Canada). Repeated calls for labour were made in part because young
colonists showed a decided reluctance to learn most trades. Lunn ascribes
this to the attraction of alternative opportunities (p. 260), but the contem¬
porary view, that the basic trouble was the distaste of the Canadien for
regular work of any kind (ibid., p. 259)      - i.e„ the attitudes of a pre-capitalis-
tic society may be closer to the mark.

Another difficulty was that some workers returned to France at the
expiry of their short contracts, but it does not seem true that "for the most
part, these men came reluctantly, remained a few years at excessively high
wages, and then joyfully returned to France" (ibid., p. 12). It may have been
their initial intention to return to France, but usually they did not.
Moreover, the secret by which Canada held them is revealed in at least the
case of the iron workers at Three Rivers. There, workers had scarcely
arrived when they are found, typically, marrying a Canadienne (B. Suite,
Melanges historiques [Montreal, 1920], vol. 6, "Les Forges Saint-Maurice" dd
63-80). 'FF'

90 This was Thomas Brassey's view. He sent 2,000 workers to Australia,
without attaching any condition, content in the knowledge that there was
no sizable employer but himself. (Sir Arthur Helps, Life and Labour of Mr.
Brassey, 1805-1870, 3rd ed. [London, 1872], p. 239.)

91 Toronto (daily) Leader, March 30 and May 26, 1854. The extreme labour
shortage of 1854 gave a particular justification to large-scale subsidized
immigration. But according to the press accounts, the shortage of shipping
in 1854 prevented more than 1,250 workers being sent before May 5. The
ones sent were likely skilled workers, and those delayed, the labourers
whom the Brassey firm had planned to send out that spring in sailing ves¬
sels.

slaves, the Irish Roman Catholics, in reference to the menial work and
wretched conditions accepted by these Irish in the colonies. But it will be
argued in this study that the status of the Irish in the nineteenth century
was as far as might be from the protected one of a slave, and that the
presence of the Irish was of the greatest importance to the rise of industrial
capitalism.

104 Mayor W.L. Mackenzie of Toronto was aroused over the inadequate seg¬
regation of the sexes in prisons, among other things. Having committed
two alleged prostitutes to the Toronto Gaol in November 1834, Mackenzie
was shocked to find them at large in the debtor portion of the prison. (U.C.
Sundries, Nov. 23, 1834 [Mackenzie to Rowan], This is reproduced in Clark,
Social Development of Canada, p. 251.) The Sheriff argued in reply that the only
part of the prison in which women could be segregated was unheated, and
the women had to be allowed out sometimes to get warm {U.C. Sundries,
Nov. 27, 1834 [Jarvis to Rowan]). Another case concerns two female priso¬
ners who arrived at the penitentiary in 1839 and were found to be pregnant.
The penitentiary authorities complained bitterly of the carelessness of the
Toronto gaolers. These, in turn, denied that the women could have become
pregnant in their gaol, and suggested that they might have become so
during the boat trip to Kingston (U.C. Sundries, Oct. 12, 1839 [Nickalls to
Harrison] and Oct. 17, 1839 [Jarvis to Harrison]). Very shortly afterwards,
a young girl sentenced to serve a week in Toronto Gaol for having broken
her contract under the Master and Servant's Act, was in fact released im¬
mediately because there was no place for her in the gaol except with the
"abandoned females". The discussion suggests that this was a usual course
in such cases (U.C. Sundries, Nov. 1,1839 [O'Hara to Harrison], enclosures).

105 The need for a special institution to care for the insane, and the particular
problems raised by the makeshift expedient of keeping them in gaols,
provoked much discussion in the 1830s and 1840s in Upper Canada. Cf. U.C.
Sundries, May 14, 1831 (Baby to Mudge); Feb. 16, 1839 (Petition); P.S.O.,
C.W., 1841-3, no. 3021; 1846-7, nos. 15559, 17428; and Clark, Social Deve¬
lopment of Canada, pp. 234-35. A "temporary" asylum was finally provided in
1841 when a new gaol was built at Toronto and the old one turned over
exclusively to the care of the insane (P.S.O., C. W., 1840-1, nos. 257, 397,
2895); but, presumably from lack of space, many insane persons continued


-----

to be left in local gaols. Meanwhile provision had been made for a perma-
nent asylum (U.C. Sundries, Sept. 20,1839 [appointment of commissioners]),
but this did not open until the end of 1847 (P.S.O., C.W., 1847-8, no. 18607).
A report of 1848, indicating that the new institution left much to be desired
is reproduced in Clark, op. cit., pp. 235-36. It may be that the temporary
asylum, though it could not care for all applicants, did a better job with the
inmates it had (P.S.O., CM., 1846-7, no. 16616; Canada, Journals of the
Assembly, 1841, appendix L.L.; 1842, appendix U). That accommodation for
the insane was still grossly insufficient, especially in Canada East, in 1858, is
stated in Executive Council Papers, Put By, no. 602, Report of the Ordnance Land
Agent, May 26, 1858.

100 On the condition of gaols, see U.C. Sundries, June 9, 1834 (Mackenzie to

n r'rfHJune 17' 1834 (Jarvis to Rowar>); July 26, 1834 (Powell to Rowan);
P.S.O., CM., 1841-3, nos. 3021, 4282; and Clark, op. cit., pp. 256-58. The
conditions were bad, but statements from imprisoned debtors (U.C. Sundries,
April 28,1835 [Petition of Debtors in Amherst Gaol]; June 28,1838 [Gray to
Arthur]; Clark, op. at. p. 258) should be taken with some reservation. There
is something in the position taken by contemporaries that these men did not
merit a great amount of sympathy because they could win release at any
time by taking an oath that they were worth no more than £5.

provide any money to run it, and its eventual opening, see U. C. Sundries, July

in 1845 (P.S.O., C.W., 1844-5, no. 9521) but, as might have been expected,
enforcement proved to be impossible (P.S.O., C.W., 1847-8, no. 19492).
Some were then ready to advocate complete prohibition (P.S.O., C.W.

133 A claim of this sort is made in a great many of the documents cited above.
In addition see Canada, Journals of the Assembly, 1849, app. ZZZ (Report of
Select Committee on Intemperance). This committee was very anxious to
demonstrate that crime was a result of intemperance. It analyzed the
population of Montreal Gaol in great detail, and proved, at least, that the
inmates were almost wholly from the lowest economic and social levels
of society. The Keeper of the Gaol said that the intemperance of his
charges was a consequence of their unhappy lives, not a cause of them;
but the Committee ignored this opinion.

This Report is valuable in showing the power which the temperance
movement had gained in a short time; in making clear that to a great extent
temperance was something to be imposed on other parties — i.e., the
labouring classes; and in bringing out the capitalist puritanism that inspired
the movement. Thus, an educational system was advocated (the savings
on police would pay for it) since: "Temperance, therefore, the parent of
economy, is closely allied to knowledge. Labour, too, is the source of wealth
— it produces capital... .Riches, then, which are proverbially the reward
of industry, are incompatible with intemperance."

Servant Act (R.H. Coats, "The Labour Movement in Canada", Canada and Its
Provinces [Toronto, 1914], vol. IX, p. 299). So far as I can make out, the law
was rather amended so that a breach of contract on the part of an employee
was no longer a criminal offence, but a civil offence, as a breach by the
employer always had been.

###### Chapter II

1 In law, the wage earner of the free labour market is a free, independent
agent, as the employer is. In classical and neo-classical economic theory, the
haggling of the labour market containing many workers seeking work, and
many employers seeking labour, not only coordinated dispersed wage
bargains into an economic whole, but (by analogies and assumptions)

than the demand for workmen* A labour reserve is necessary for its sanc¬
tions to operate effectively. These sanctions are the simplified minimum
of the attraction of wages and the repulsion of dismissal — i.e., the attrac¬
tion of life and the repulsion of starvation. On the other hand, the system
can only continue if the bulk of the labouring class, with their families, are
able to retain life and some measure of working efficiency. A proportion of
failure in this respect can be met very economically, and had been met, by
the provision of relief agencies. However, the system would lose its logic if
employers had to provide in relief, in order to retain their work force, as
much as they gained by evading the overhead costs of the working class.

2 The employer's position resembles that of the person who, to have use of a
machine, finds he must buy rather than rent, and that he must buy a larger
size of machine than he requires ordinarily. To the extent that the capita¬
list labour market involved a pooling of labour that could be shared by
employers whose needs did not coincide, it presented a genuine economy.

6 The system is described and analyzed in W.B. Munro, The Seigniorial System in
Canada (New York, 1907). Munro argued that the Canadian system was
much closer in operation to early classical feudalism than was the contem¬
porary French system (p. 13).

8 Reid, op. cit., p. 132. Miss Reid appears to mean that the small-scale and craft
nature of colonial industry was perpetuated by craft tradition and appren¬
ticeship—"still the royal road to mastership in Quebec as late as 1710" —
but the argument is dubious. Apprenticeship training was supplemented
by immigration and by a trades school given rather extravagant praise in
Mason Wade, The French Canadians 1760-1945 (Toronto, 1955), p. 26, though
artisan training did not last long. There is no inherent relation between
apprenticeship training and the scale of industry. Miss Reid herself notes
the absence of legal impediments to the choice of industrial employments
in New France.

“ StCtl°n 15 n0t intended to add to literature of the Canadian fur
trade but to point out features of its labour organization. The argument is
substantially that of H.A. Innis, The Fur Trade in Canada (New Haven, 1930),
in which work labour organization was given a position of importance.

The trade seems to have taken about 500 men in 1681 (population not quite
10,000); about 1,000 men in 1720 (population about 25,000); and 2,000 men
or more in 1750 (population about 50,000). Cf. Innis, op. cit., pp. 62-67

"Lunn,,.,*., pp. 126-27. The data are not sufficient to be very conclusive,
but the figure given fits well with wages shortly after the Conquest, and
custom had a powerful influence on such wage rates.

20 Skilled shipyard workers were paid 2 livres in winter and 2Vi livres in
summer per day. The number of days worked and the costs of subsistence
can only be guessed, but it seems doubtful whether carpenters could have
been much better off than canoemen.

23 Ibid., pp. 215, 220, 242-43. Innis gives wages of canoemen in 1767, follow¬
ing Ermatinger, as follows: guide (to Grand Portage), 350 I.; foremen and
steersmen, 300-320 1.; middlemen, 250 I.; winterers, 300-400 1. Lawrence
Ermatinger's "Engagement Book" for 1773-75 (P.A.C., M.G. 29/128)
shows that some wages had risen substantially in the intervening seven
years. Middlemen still get about 250 1.; foremen and steersmen are at about
350 1. — 10 per cent higher; but the pay of guides had doubled to 700 1., and
winterers' pay was nearly doubled at about 600 1. Innis shows further wage
increases by 1800, especially for skilled men (p. 242). The indefatiguable
reporter. Lord Selkirk, writing in January 1804, indicates still higher wages
and some other instructive points besides:

The wintering men are bargained with for about $200 [1,000 livres
if the Iivre remained the equivalent of a shilling, which it did so far
as is known to the writer] — Bouts de Canot for $300 with equip¬
ments from $60 to 100 [the estimate is high or the kits had increased]
these wages are higher than they were before the competition, are
doubly chargeable because formerly the engages used to take a great
part of their wages in articles of luxury for themselves or of finery for
their Indian wives—this was encouraged by the Company so much
that a great proportion of their men were in debt to them —this
reduced their wages to little because these goods were charged at a
very high rate —Of late however the men have become more saving
partly because the wages are so immense that they are sufficient at
once to enrich a man — partly because the competition of the Com¬
panies keeps them continually on the alerte following the Indians

with a high hand — they have occasionally flogged and put them in
irons — in general they find little difficulty in managing them —
which certainly would not be the case with Americans who would
know exactly how far their master's authority extended.... The
Canadians however require a good deal of temper & attention in their
leaders to be completely managed."

somewhat inferior to English ones (Suite, op. cit., pp. 172, 183).

53 It was claimed in 1762 that the Forges had produced 400 tons of cast iron to
that date (R.C. Rowe, "The St. Maurice Forges", Canadian Geographical
Journal, IX [1934], p. 21). Total output should have been about twenty
times that amount. It is clear that cast products took a relatively small part
of the output during the French regime, whatever the precise proportion.

54 Cf. Lunn, op. cit., p. 329.

55 Ibid., p. 335.

Sb This is not readily explained, since it seems to have been generally consi¬
dered that the Forges could be made very profitable. Hocquart evidently
thought the lack of capital in the colony ruled out the possibility of local
operation (Lunn, op. cit., pp. 320-21).

61 The sawmill certainly operated in the 1770s, but the gristmill probably was
not added until after 1796, by the Bell management. The mills are noted by
Selkirk, 1804 (Selkirk Papers, vol. 75, p. 159).

62 The chief informant for this period is somewhat unreliable: Pierre de Sales
Laterriere, a medical man who became Quebec sales agent for the iron
works, assistant director of the Forges, and then director, 1776-78.

63 Laterriere's figures (Suite, op. cit., p. 159). Sales certainly were not so high a
few years later, but the war period probably offered exceptional demand,
and the claims of a very large labour force at this time support this view.

Papers, 1852, app. CCC (by E. Parent, Asst. Prov. Sec.), which suggests that
price, in the sense of some amount of cash payment, may have been the
obstacle in 1843. According to Parent, the overflowing habitant popula¬
tion would take any kind of land, however bad, if offered under feudal
tenure — i.e., with no cash down. But he asserted also that those who took
bad lands in this way did not plan to settle permanently, but only to strip
wood and exhaust the soil with a few crops. Parent also observed that
settlement agitation from 1836 — the beginning of a genuine popular
agitation — was aimed at Cap de la Madeleine rather than St. Maurice.

n3 Three Welshmen were brought to the Forges about 1770. One, at least,
married a Canadienne and was absorbed into the community. The given
names in later lists of workmen indicate other cases of absorption. A
census of 1820 numbered only five Protestants at the Forges. A list of 1842
shows twelve residents with British surnames (Suite, op. cit., pp. 169, 184,

i15At the start, all workmen were evidently on annual salary. By 1752
(Franquet) some were on piece rates, but a large number were not. By the
early nineteenth century, according to Selkirk and Lambert, nearly all
workmen were paid by the piece.

119 Skilled shipyard workers during the French regime evidently received 2Vi
livres per day in summer and 2 livres in winter. Allowing 250 days of emp¬
loyment per year, their annual incomes would be a little less than 600 livres
compared with the 400 livres (exclusive of rent and fuel) at the Forges.
Kalm reported that journeymen got considerably more in 1749 — three to
four livres per day — suggesting a much worse relative position for the
forgeworkers (Kalm, Travels in North America, vol. Ill, p. 70). If the rate for
skilled workmen around 1800 is taken at 6s. per day —and this is thought a
fair and slightly conservative estimate — 250 days of employment would
yield 1,500 livres, against 800 to 1,000 livres for the forgeworkers. The
forgemen certainly failed to maintain parity with skilled canoemen in this
period, but the competition of rival fur companies was a factor in that
situation.

company town, much like St. Maurice. Selkirk noted that the Batiscan
works had proved very expensive to build and that Batiscan sales were only
about half those of St. Maurice (in 1804). He also reported that the Batiscan
management contracted with “American workmen" for their supply of
charcoal, rather than hiring workmen to produce it as St. Maurice did,
because they considered that method to be cheaper (Selkirk Papers, vol. 75, p.
159). The defalcations of John Craigie, one of the proprietors of Batiscan,
and the subsequent actions of the Crown against him, may have played a

123 Suite, op. cit., pp. 192-94. One of the Islet proprietors was "Robichon". This
name was celebrated at the Forges from the beginning. There is some
further information on the Radnor Forges in Benoit Brouillette, "Le
Developpement industriel de la Vallee du St. Maurice" in Pages trifluviennes,
Series A, no. 2 (Trois Rivieres, 1932), pp. 12-13. The Radnor Forges
produced about 2,000 tons of iron per year and employed 200 to 400
workmen in 1863, according to Charles Robb in Eighty Years Progress of
British North America, ed. H.Y. Hind (Toronto, 1863), p. 319.

124 British military authorities took numerous steps to strengthen Canada's
military defences following the war of 1812-14, but the Kingston naval
base and dockyard was an anchor of their system. It was considered that
the base would be much more secure if it had access to a local supply of iron,
and naval authorities sought to encourage the establishment of an iron¬
works to use the iron deposits known to be around Kingston by offering
contracts for iron "ballast". Negotiations were carried on in 1816 with
William Henderson, a Quebec merchant (U.C. Sundries, Jan. 31, 1816 [Owen
to Gore]; Feb. 12 [Henderson to Gifford]; Feb. 12 [Gore to Owen]; Feb. 20

[Henderson to Gifford]; July 16 [Committee of Executive Council on Hen¬
derson s application for a grant of land]). The prohibition at this time on
the grants of land in fee simple gave some difficulty, but the main trouble
may have been that the land Henderson wanted (at Gananoque) had al¬
ready been granted to one Sunderlin, who had complied with the conditions
of his grant by erecting an ironworks in 1802. Other land was, however,
offered. Henderson was quite aware of the Marmora deposits but probably
decided they were too remote. Hayes was given a contract to supply pig
iron to the dockyard to the extent of £13,000 sterling (Upper Canada,
Journals of the Assembly, 1839, Appendix vol. II, part I, p. 239), probably at
about 20s. currency per cwt. He was granted lands at Marmora forthwith
though he may not have appreciated his location, for he referred to his grant
as the "Gananoque ore" (U.C.S., Nov. 3, 1820 [Hayes to Hillier]).

125 U.C.S., Mar. 31, 1824 (Hayes to Hillier). The figure may be inflated by the
inclusion of operating costs, since Hayes reported his investment at
£10,000 in May 1822, by which time the main works at least were comple¬
ted (U.C.S., May 20 [Hayes to Hillier, enclosure]).

126 Upper Canada, Journals of the Assembly, 1839, Appendix vol. II, part II, pp.
236-37.

127 Hayes blamed his financial troubles on "the unexpected failure of my
Agent in London". He tried to mortgage Marmora to the provincial
government for £6,000 (U.C.S., Mar. 31, 1824 [Hayes to Hilliar]). Next he
tried to sell, and evidently approached the Carron Company (U.C.S., Nov.
16, 1824 [Hayes to Maitland]). The creditors foreclosed sometime before
August 1825. Hayes returned to England in 1826, still intent upon getting
Marmora back (U.C.S., Apr. 3, 1826 [Hayes to Hillier]). Peter McGill
explained his succession to the Forges with delightful delicacy: "... on such
suspension or failure in 1825, your Memorialist, as one of the principal
creditors of Mr. Hayes, was appointed a Trustee for the said works, for the
benefit of himself and all the other Creditors; but that finding such Trust
incompatible with the interest and Security of your Memorialist, or the
advantage of the establishment itself, the Deed of Trust was cancelled, and
your Memorialist became possessed of the Property in fee simple..."


-----

128 McGill filled a navy order for 750 tons of pig iron in 1826, and it may have
operated at times, on some scale, in the 1830s (U.C.5., Mar. 2, 1832. Return
of Manufactures of Midland District, Aug. 13, 1832 [Smith to Rowan]). In
1828 he tried to obtain £10,000 from the government on a mortgage of the
works. He must, as he claimed, have thought Marmora had prospects, to
make this move; but he refused, on the other hand, to risk more of his own
money in it. He offered the bland explanation that he did not feel he could
withdraw more money from his own and his partners' business (U.C.S.,
Jan. 25, 1828 [McGill to Hillier]). McGill tried to sell Marmora to the pro¬
vince in 1837, to become the provincial penitentiary, for £20,000 of
debentures at 6 per cent or £25,000 at 5 per cent (Upper Canada, Journals,
1839, Appendix vol. II, part I, p. 241).

129 Ibid., p. 244, shows the expenses in 1826. They amount to £19 per day of
which £12 went for wages. The master founder was paid 15s. per day,
skilled labour from 5s. to 7s. 6d., and labourers 3s. 3d. Hayes probably paid
the same rates. He remarked that expenses could not be reduced below
£100 per week (U.C.5., Dec. 11, 1822 [Hayes to Maitland]).

130 Hayes made a great point from the beginning of insisting that no taverns
should be licensed in the vicinity of Marmora (U.C.S., Mar. 6, 1821). He
argued similarly against taverns ("the very Pest of the Province") at the end
of 1822, but said his workmen had so far been sober (U.C.S., Dec. 19, 1822

[Hayes to Maitland]).

131 U.C.S., May 20, 1822 (Hayes to Hillier). According to Hayes, there was a
good deal of violence at this time, but its nature and cause are not clear.
Hayes was at odds with local settlers, among others.

132 U.C.S., Dec. 19, 1822 (Hayes to Maitland).

133 U.C.S., Dec. 30, 1822 (Hayes to Maitland).

134 Hayes and his workmen encountered to begin with the hostility of local
Indians who complained of his encroachment on their hunting grounds and
of his parsimony with presents (U.C.S., Mar. 6, 1821 [Hayes to Hillier]).
Summer brought, of course, mosquitoes and black flies (U.C.S., Aug. 2,
1821 [Hayes to Hillier]). Hayes had been allowed time to choose the precise
lands he wanted, and he took a long time making up his mind. The chronic
hostility shown by settlers was probably due to this delay and to the dis¬
possession of squatters, and possibly also to Hayes's intense hostility to
liquor sales (U.C.S., Aug. 2, 1821 [Hayes to Hillier]; May 20, 1822 [Hayes
to Hillier]; Mar. 31, 1824 [Hayes to Hillier]).

135 The King's corvee evidently was not usually onerous and it could be
commuted for a money payment (W.B. Munro, The Seigniorial System in
Canada [New York, 1907], pp. 132-33). The heavy calls upon the militia for
transport service are noted in G.F.G. Stanley, Canada's Soldiers, 1604-1954:
The Military History of an Unmilitary People (Toronto, 1954), p. 23. The con¬
struction of the fortifications of Quebec from 1701 onwards involved heavy
corvees upon the people of Quebec and of its neighbourhood, which
brought protests. Regular troops were also employed in this work and liked
it no better. (Reid, The Development and Importance of the Town of Quebec,
1608-1760, p. 95.)

was used to build several forts and a road in the Richelieu Valley (ibid., p. 14).

138 According to Lunn, the force varied between 600 and 800 men until it was
sharply expanded in 1750 (ibid., p. 15). While a great deal depends upon how
tar below strength the companies were kept, the description in Stanley, op.
at., pp. 25-26, suggests a considerably larger force.

146 There are numerous examples in W.O. 34, vols. 60, 61 and 64 (Amherst
Papers, P.A.C.) pertaining to the recruitment of labour in Boston and New
York, 1759-62. One of the groups involved was the seamen. The British
military authorities were for solving their problems by impressment, but
they were frustrated at Boston by the solid opposition of all the elements of
the city (vol. 61, passim). The same seems to have been true at New York and
Philadelphia. Amherst was reluctant, however, to obtain the required
seamen by offering higher wages as “their Wages are already so Exorbi-
tantly high, that I cannot possibly think of Encreasing it..!' (vol. 60, p.
152 and passim). Much the same trouble arose in hiring carpenters at New
York in 1759, Amherst and his officers being reluctant to meet the New
York wage rates of 11s. 6d. per day, or better, plus provisions (vof. 64, p.
161). One consequence of this conflict was that the military authorities
handled the artisans they did get with a brusqueness and lack of considera¬
tion that must have made it harder and harder for them to get men.

A determined resistance of the habitants about Montreal to bateau service
in 1765 is shown in S10 (P.A.C.), Oct. 12, 1765 (Christie to Gray); Oct. 13,
1765 (Christie to Burton); Oct. 13, 1765 (Le Goterie to Christie). A stub¬
born refusal of the habitants in 1810 to provide carts and horses to trans¬
port the baggage of troops employed in road making appears in S85, Nov.
30, 1810 (Bowen to Craig).

152 Lord Selkirk reported that Fort George was built by troops on a piece work
basis, in the belief that the cost was only half of what it would have been
with civilian labour (Selkirk Papers, vol. 75, p. 271).

153 William Claus s Garden Book" (William Claus Papers [P.A.C.], vol. 20, no.
14) has entries of the labour which Claus hired at Niagara from 1809 to
1819. A substantial portion of the men hired were soldiers. The irregula¬
rity of their attendance suggests that they could only escape their duties at
the neighbouring posts for a few days at a time.

161 U.C.S., April 2, 1816, (Owen to Gore). The temper of the period was also
demonstrated in the treatment of some shipyard workers hired at Quebec
for duty at Kingston in 1815. No work having been found for these men,
they were nevertheless given an allowance of ten days' pay at wartime
rates, the officer in charge stressing that he was anxious "not to offend any
class of H.M. Subjects" (U.C.S., Feb. 21, 1816 [Owen to Loring]).

However, it was asserted in 1835 that free grants were being denied to all
claimants (U.C.S., Oct. 30, 1835 [Rowan to Sughrue]).

164 The first of the Companies arrived on the Canal on June 10, 1827 (U.C.S.,
July 7, 1827 [By to Mann]).

385 In 1826 and 1827, it was anticipated that skilled labour (in particular) would
be hard to get and hold on the Rideau. One reason for the construction of a
stone bridge across the Ottawa River during the winter of 1826-27 was to
prevent masons from going elsewhere (John McTaggart, Three Years in
Canada: An Account of the Actual State of the Country in 1826-7-8 ..., 2 vols.

[London, 1829], vol. I, pp. 337-47). The preparation of cut stone was under¬
taken for the same purpose of holding artisans (U.C.S., Nov. 4,1827 [By to
Maitland]); and it seems likely that the expected shortage of labour provided
much of the inspiration for other paternalistic measures, such as the
assignment of town lots to artisans. By underestimated the labour that
would prove to be available, and thereby got himself into trouble. He
advertised more contracts than he desired actually to make, in the expecta¬
tion that few would be taken. But the contracts were taken up readily, to an
extent much beyond the work that could be paid for out of the funds alloted
to By at the time. The more By tried to restrain the work, so as to eke out
his money, the more energetic each contractor became in the hope of reali¬
zing a larger share of whatever funds appeared (U.C.S., April 24, 1828 [By
to Hillier]; June 10, 1828 [By to Mann]).

166 By emphasized how expensive Sapper and Miner labour was, in refusing an
offer of additional companies (U.C.S., June 10, 1828 [By to Mann]).

167 Colonel Stanley gives the impression that grants of land were promised to
the Sappers and Miners at the time of their recruitment (Stanley, Canada's
Soldiers..., p. 187). In fact. By first proposed that land should be promised,
as a means of checking desertion, in September 1828 (U.C.S., Sept. 11,
1828 [By to Mann]; L. Breault, Ottawa Old and New [Ottawa, 1946], p. 49).
The authorization of 100 acres for each of the Sappers and Miners, upon
completion of the work, is noted in U.C.S., Aug. 30, 1831 (Clegg to Felton,

ployed on the Rideau Canal; but the grants failed either to get land settled
or to keep labour available. The lands granted were too far from the works
to allow labourers to live on their lots and do canal work too, and those
who chose to give up their work to attempt settlement were driven out
by starvation, according to By. (U.C.S., April 29, 1829 [A.C. Buchanan to
Colborne and enclosures]). While the Sappers and Miners were employed
on the Rideau, a similar force called "Staff Corps Companies" was similarly
occupied on the Grenville Canal. These men also were offered grants of
land upon completion of satisfactory service (Ql99 [P.A.C.], pp. 60, 73, 77).

was in the feudal military tradition. It is distinguishable in this way from
other plans, notably those put forward in the 1840s, which were not in
reality plans for military units but programs for the importation of in¬
dentured labour into Canada on a large scale, and for the enforcement of
t e indentures by military sanctions. These latter plans were discussed
above in connection with slavery.

173 The distress that prevailed in 1837 is set out in U.C.5., May 8,1837 (Carey

ployed construction workers left for the United States in very large
numbers in the summer of 1838 (U.C.S., May 21, 1839 [Roy to Macaulay];
Aug. 31, 1839 [Hawke to Harrison]). There was complaint that harvest
labour was short in 1838 (U.C.S., Aug. 3, 1839 [Moyle to -]); and labour in
general was scarce in 1839 (U.C.S., Dec. 31, 1839 [Rubidge to Hawke];

175 The negro troops were ready to proceed with road work, as in previous
years, in April 1842. No further evidence on road work has been found. It
seems likely that it was the force which had been used hitherto on roads,
which was dispatched to the Welland Canal when trouble arose there in
August 1842. (P.S.O., C.W., 1841-3, no. 4274.)

176 Troops were first called out in connection with the Welland Canal in July
1842. The use of troops at this work, and at others, is described in C60
(P.A.C.), passim. The troops at the Welland Canal were supposed to be
removed in July 1847 (P.S.O., C.W., 1846-7, no. 16757; C61 [P.A.C.], p.
170). However, if the troops left, they were soon back, for they were
stationed on the canal in 1849 and 1850 (C317 [P.A.C.], pp. 219-21, 234-37,
260; C318, p. 147). After 1850, it was the railway construction labourers (at
Hamilton) who were deemed to require the oversight of troops (C3 18, pp.

183 Selkirk said that "Seamen [on the lakes] must be paid all year tho' only 6
months work" (Selkirk Papers, vol. 75, p. 6); though at another place he
reported that the men were paid £4 per month for six months (which he
may have regarded as double wages) and were discharged in winter (ibid., p.
86). According to another authority, "sailors had to be brought up from the
ocean and retained on pay during the five or six months when the harbors
are frozen up" (J.M. and Edw. Trout, The Railroads of Canada for 1870-1

[Toronto, 1871], p. 21). These references apply to the beginning of the
century. It was stated in reference to 1843 that sailors were hired only for
the season, though wages were much as before, and that "about two-thirds
of the seamen on these lakes are supplied from among the hardy west
Highlanders, chiefly Argyle fishermen. They go to the lakes during the
summer, and work usually upon a farm in the winter season..." (Views of
Canada and the Colonists, By a Four Year Resident [Edinburgh, 1844], p. 141). The
sailors of 1804 were said to be mostly deserters from English ships at
Quebec (Selkirk Papers, vol. 75, p. 270). Some categories of skilled labour
were evidently still more scarce on the lakes than sailors. There is an
account of the extraordinary pains taken to retain a chief engineer, about
1827, in Scadding, Toronto of Old, p. 556.

184 At the beginning of the nineteenth century, carpenters were often
brought to Upper Canada from New York (Selkirk Papers, vol. 75, p. 6; Trout,

op. cit., p. 21). Itinerant tradesmen were also available, but probably were
not very skilled or reliable (W. Caniff, History of the Settlement of Upper Canada

he expects to draw profits from his neighbours. (Three Years in Canada...,

took a labourer at least four years to save enough to set up for himself.

1 Census of Canada, 1870-1, vol. IV, presents all the censuses taken before 1871
in considerable detail. Census of Canada, 1931, vol. I, presents summaries of
population only for these.

2 What groups to include in a labour force is a matter of judgment. In cur¬
rent computations, great numbers are excluded because they do not offer
themselves in the labour market, although under slightly different con¬
ditions than those that exist, they would do so. Any attempt to compute a
labour force for the nineteenth century would have to face, in a far more
acute form, the problem of how to handle persons not actively in the labour
market, who nevertheless could be induced to take employment under


-----

stable conception, could be calculated pretty accurately for many dates, if
there was any advantage in making the calculation. But general population
figures seem to offer all the information required.

3 See Table I. The estimate that the French-Canadian population increased
at 3 per cent per year is based on the fact that this rate gives close results
when applied to years for which population figures are available. But the fit
is far from perfect or consistent, which may indicate variations in the rate
of population growth or errors in the censuses, or both. Cf., Jacques
Henripen, "From Acceptance of Nature to Control", Canadian Journal of
Economics and Political Science, February 1957, pp. 10-19, especially p. 14.

4 Census of Canada, 1870-1, vol. IV, p. 74.

5 See Table III, Immigration, pp. 82-84. The numbers coming to Canada from
England became predominant in this decade, especially after 1854, but it
may still be asked if these immigrants were English, or Irishmen sailing
from Liverpool — as the immense "English" contribution of 1847 was (G.N.
Tucker, The Canadian Commercial Revolution, 1845-1851 [New Haven, 1936],
p. 157n). There are good reasons for thinking that immigrants from Eng¬
land in the 1850s were mostly English. One is that the English immigration
was particularly noticeable after 1854, when Irish migration is known to
have dropped sharply, and especially so to Canada. Another is that great
numbers of English are known to have come to Canada, to take the skilled
wage-earning jobs that opened in the 1850s. Finally, the 1861 census of
British-born in Canada supports this view.

7Ibid., p. 440.

8 The extreme confinement of the French-Canadian population to agricul¬
ture was stressed by Georges Langlois, Histoire de la population canadienne-
franfaise (Montreal, 1934). Langlois cited data to show that about 22 per
cent of the French population was urban in 1760, whereas only about 14
per cent was urban in 1861 — i.e., the rural proportion of a greatly enlarged
population increased over this century from 78 per cent to 86 per cent (pp.
183-84). As a matter of fact, the dependence of the French on agriculture
seems to have been greater still in 1851, when Montreal and Quebec held
only 7Vz per cent of the French population of Lower Canada, as against
8Vi per cent in 1861, and 10Vz in 1871. Simon Goldberg, in his "The French-
Canadians and the Industrialization of Quebec" (M.A. thesis, McGill
University, 1940), also stressed the degeneration of French society into one
almost exclusively rural (p. 92), and provided an able analysis of the causes
and significance of this phenomenon.

Brassey, Work and Wages (New York, 1872), pp. 86-87, it is stated that
French-Canadian labourers on the Grand Trunk were paid 3s. 6d. per day,
while "Englishmen" received from 5s. to 6s. per day, "but it was found that
the English did the greatest amount of work for the money".

23 Munro, op. cit., p. 218. Munro stated (p. 85) that the lands granted under
seigneurial tenure averaged over 1,000 arpents per holding. This figure
could only be obtained by including the seigneurial reserves, and refers to
the year 1760. New English-speaking seigneurs practised various abuses
(pp. 220, 233), including the diversion of what the habitants regarded as
their patrimony to others. However, the abuses did not constitute a reason
why habitants should desire a conversion of seigneurial lands to freehold,
since even the slight existing restraints on the seigneurs would then be
removed.

was in reply to views like this that men familiar with the province, like
Aylmer, wrote to the contrary.

seigneurs forced the habitants to concentrate on grain (J.I. Cooper,
"French-Canadian Conservatism in Principle and in Practice, 1873-1891"

[Ph.D. thesis, McGill University, 1938]). It seems to me that there is room
to doubt whether the seigneurs were responsible to any great extent for
the concentration on grain growing, and that peasant inertia was probably
the chief factor in maintaining this emphasis.

sense that the selling price of their land was lessened by it. From the French
viewpoint —that seigneurs held their lands in trust for others —the
seigneurs got too much. The biggest seigneur in the province by far, the
Church, was neutralized by its exemption from the abolition.

62 Agitation was carried on in terms of the censitaire’s right to use water power
(Ryerson, Erench Canada, pp. 119-20), but in this respect cannot be taken
seriously. The man who was uninterested in maximizing returns from his
small farm would not have been capable of doing much with a mill site.
What may have been behind the agitation was the desire of English-
speaking capitalists to get power sites on easier terms than seigneurs
offered. Some English-speaking seigneurs had promoted considerable
industrial development on their estates (Wade, The Erench-Canadians, p. 116).

150,000 Americans in Canada in 1815.

71 Many canal contractors in Canada, probably more than half the total, were
Americans. The American willingness to dig canals, so long as the work
was on a contract basis, was demonstrated in the construction of the Erie
Canal in which a great number of small contractors were employed. See

The position of the Toronto artisans is indicated in the solid support they
gave Mackenzie politically and in Mackenzie's celebrated remark, in plan¬
ning his rebellion, "that we should instantly send for Dutcher's foundry-
men and Armstrong's axe-makers, all of whom could be depended on..."
(Charles Lindsay, The Life and Times of Wm. Lyon Mackenzie, 2 vols. [Toronto,
1862], vol. II, pp. 19, 47, 55). There was a hubbub in 1816 when nine work¬
men at Gananoque provided a "riotous" celebration of July 4. They were
required to promise not to repeat this gesture (U.C.S., July 1816 [? to
McMahon]). Also, "it is notorious that, a large proportion of disaffected per¬
sons forms the population of many large Towns in this, if not the other
Province" (U.C.S., Oct. 10,1838 [Crooks to Macaulay]). Tanners are named

79 For the quality of Americans as pioneers and farmers, see Jones, History of
Agriculture in Ontario, p. 54. Fowke, Canadian Agricultural Policy, pp. 82-88,
argues the merit of extensive agriculture for Lower Canada. The
argument would seem to apply to Upper Canada. Howison, Sketches of Upper

Niagara Peninsula who were "indifferent to everything but field crops".

90 Studies of emigration often devote a great amount of space to emigration
movements sponsored by governments, possibly because these are well
documented and because they illuminate government policy. Organized
movements are useful to inaugurate emigration from areas previously
unfamiliar with it. But machinery to cater to individual migration appears
to have developed very quickly in European countries, and the individual
method becomes the accepted one. Sponsored emigration accounts for
only a tiny portion of the emigrants who went to America.

93 While the capitalistic labour market requires a surplus of labour large
enough to meet upward fluctuations in demand, large numbers of chron¬
ically unemployed persons tend to be harmful to it. For example, the
development of India is hampered by its chronic oversupply of labour, pro¬
moting low wage rates which hinder the introduction of new techniques
in production and deny on the other side a mass market for all but a few
articles. In Canada, the danger from the appearance of large numbers of
unemployed persons, beyond the risk of political instability, has been that
public welfare expenditures might become so burdensome as to neutralize
the economies of the capitalistic market. See H.C. Pentland, "The Develop¬
ment of a Capitalistic Labour Market in Canada", Canadian Journal of Eco¬
nomics and Political Science, November 1959, especially p. 450-51.

relevant to this study; but it is noteworthy that these late peasant migrants
resembled the early Celtic migrants in many respects. They were driven
out by population and land pressures analogous to (but not the same as)
those of Celtic lands, and their behaviour patterns in America were like
those of Celts and French-Canadians. On the demand side, this migration
may be supposed to reflect the expansion of unskilled and semi-skilled
employment in mass production industries, superseding the stage of de¬
pendence on craftsmen which had supported Teutonic immigration.

negotiated to a compromise agreement.

111 Statistics of racial origin, and commentaries, indicate that very few Welsh
came to Canada. A few came as miners or ironworkers; but the relatively
small numbers of miners who came to Canada came more commonly from
Cornwall. Presumably the opportunities for the Welsh in the United
States, the precedents established of migration to that country, and the
Welsh system of group emigration, worked to prevent the Welsh making
any significant contribution to the people of Canada.

112 A.C. Buchanan estimated that Canada had received 5,000 overseas
immigrants between 1790 and 1815 (Ql98 pt. 1 [P.A.C.], p. 59). Cowan,
Bntish Emigration to British North America, accounts for rather less than 5,000
to Canada before 1815, though for about double that number to the
Maritime Provinces. J.T. Culliton, Assisted Emigration and Land Settlement with
Special Reference to Western Canada, McGill University Studies no. 9 (Montreal,
1928), p. 13, asserted that 20,000 immigrants a year entered the St.
Lawrence, 1769-74; but it appears that there is no basis for this claim and
that it is quite wrong.

Henry Hamilton, The Industrial Revolution in Scotland (Oxford, 1932). The
early chapters deal with Scottish agricultural organization, and with the
crucial linen trade. There is an analysis of Scottish emigration, pp. 68-75.

21 According to Buchanan in 1828, "A great proportion of those [immigrants]
from Ireland are from the Province of Ulster, and their feelings strongly
attach them to prefer a British Colony where they could still enjoy the
blessings of our Constitution..." (MG 22: 34, Dec. 1828, Buchanan's

within the Macdonald coalitions, was at least as important. See D.

30 Migration to New England, which was early and substantial, is noted in
Lounsbury, op. n't., pp. 172, 178-79, 253, 259, 325. Selkirk reported in 1803
that there were about 800 Irish fisherman in Nova Scotia, mostly from
Newfoundland. Arrivals were occasional: "there is no regular migration"
(Selkirk Papers, vol. 74, p. 174).

31 Ibid., vol. 75, pp. 216-17. It would appear that a great part of the Irish in
New York were indentured at this time. Selkirk also found a sizable group
of Irish Catholics in Albany, a good part of whom, with their priest, had
emigrated because they were implicated in the rebellion of 1798 (ibid, vol
74, p. 227).

not numerous elsewhere.

Sick and Needy, who are suffering, not only from Disease, but also from
Hunger, & from almost every other Misery concomitant upon the want of
the common Necessaries of Life... principally occasion'd, I understand, by the
numerous Labourers returning from the Rideau Canal, where they have
fallen victims of Disease..." (U.C.S., Oct. 24, 1827 [Tunney to Hillier]).

"One thing I cannot omit to mention, which is, the slovenly dilapidated
appearance of many of the houses [in Kingston], so familiar to those who
have travelled in Ireland .. .houses in a half unfinished state ... half tumb¬
ling to the ground, for want of timely repairs" (A Canadian Settler, The
Emigrant's Informant: or, A Guide to Upper Canada [London, 1834] [P.A.C.,
Pamphlets I, no 1477], p. 129).

40 In 1826, Bishop Macdonell asked for more money to support more Irish
priests — he had three in a total of eight — because Irish labourers and
artisans were spread over "the whole of this tract of country" (Toronto
eastward?) (U.C.S., Mar. 9, 1826 [Macdonell to Maitland]). Maitland,
however, declared that Roman Catholics then formed no more than one-
fifteenth, at the most, of the population of Upper Canada (Q340, p. 539).
This would only allow 11,000 Catholics to Upper Canada, and allow no
room for Irish whatever. There is a statistic that reports 36,435 Roman
Catholics in Upper Canada, in 1829. Allowing for Scottish and French
Catholics, this might leave room for 10,000 Irish. There were reported


-----

68,000 people did not state a religious denomination. However, there
were more Irish Catholics in Lower than in Upper Canada, and a total of
about 25,000 in 1830 seems possible. The number certainly increased
rapidly in the 1830s. By 1842, there were 65,000 Catholics in Upper Canada,
the additions certainly being mostly Irish. In 1844, Catholics exceeded
French-Canadians in Lower Canada by 48,000. The "effectively Irish in
Canada are therefore estimated at 85,000 for 1842-44. The phrase "effec¬
tively Irish" indicates those Irish Catholic in culture and behaviour, in¬
cluding those born outside Ireland. The concept was used by Clapham, in
consideration of Irish resistance to assimilation.

41 The number of persons in Ontario and Quebec who confessed to Irish
origin in 1871 was 683,000. This total is estimated to consist of 260,000
Irish Catholics and 425,000 Irish Protestants. The estimates, which can
only be approximate, are reached by balancing origins, religious denomina¬
tions and places of birth.

43 But it appears that the bulk of unemployed Irish labourers simply moved
into Chicago or to other works (many hundreds from here appeared in
Canada), and that some of the Irish who settled on the land did so only until
new employment opportunities appeared. See W.V. Pooley, The Settlement of
Illinois from 1830 to 1850, Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin, no. 220,
History Series, vol. I, no. 4 (Madison, 1908), pp. 492-501; P.W. Gates, The
Illinois Central Railroad and Its Colonization Work (Cambridge, Mass., 1934),
p. 89; B.L. Pierce, A History of Chicago, vol. I (New York, 1937), pp. 70-71,
151, 166.

44 In Nova Scotia, "few take up farming as they are not well received in the
interior part of the country by the Methodists & New light people, who are
there prevalent & dislike them as Catholics ..." (Selkirk Papers, vol. 74, p. 174).
Protestant hostility was a factor in Selkirk's abortive plan to settle these
Irish, and others from New York, in Upper Canada (ibid., vol. 75, pp. 300-
301).

45 An excellent description and analysis of the position of the Irish in Boston
is provided in Oscar Handlin, Boston's Immigrants, 1790-1865 (Cambridge,
Mass., 1941). Descriptions to the same effect may be found for other cities
in North America and Great Britain.

46 Adams, Ireland and Irish Emigration, pp. 358-86, offers a useful analysis of the
impact of Irish immigration on American social life and politics. For Great
Britain, see Clapham, "Irish immigration into Great Britain in the nine¬
teenth century".

47 Adams, op. cit., p. 206, ascribes Irish crowding into the large cities of
America to poverty, to a "manufacturing background" — an absence of this
background is more evident — and to the "natural gregariousness of the
Irish people". Hansen, besides noting that a good many Irish did become
farmers, and perhaps exaggerating their numbers, credits urban crowding
to the attractiveness of a steady job, of the church and of good Irish com¬
pany (Atlantic Migration, p. 302; The Immigrant in American History, pp. 159,
165). Hostile writers made still less effort to understand the Irish position.
Wakefield said they made themselves "virtually slaves by means of their
servile, lazy, reckless habit of mind, and their degradation in the midst of
the energetic, accumulating, prideful, domineering, Anglo-Saxon race..."
(A View of the Art of Colonization, p. 175). McTaggart, who is quoted below,

48 The fact that the Irish would accept very inferior conditions to win
employment, and sometimes act as scabs in order to replace their prede-
cessors, has obscured the fact that the Irish were even more readier than
thers in the British Isles to combine and to form unions, which were often
very successful. See Adams, op. cit., pp. 56-57, 169; Gill, The Irish Linen
Industry pp. 106-15, 140-48, 226, 241-42. The remarkable and fairly
successful trade union movement of north Britain of the late 1820s and
early 183,0s, led by John Doherty (a Roman Catholic Ulsterman) must have
depended to a considerable extent on the ubiquity of Irishmen for its
###### ^,fSTAin, Sf a,n,d,?’ Webb' Hlstory °fTrade Unionism [London, 1920], pp. 117-
124). Wakefield blamed Chartism mostly on the Irish (op. cit., p. 68).

** Statistical Sketches of Upper Canada, p. 99. Dunlop wrote of the Robinson settlers
that, having got quit of the feeling of hopelessness and despair of ever
ettering their condition, that weighs down and paralyzes the Irish
peasant in his own country, they have acquired the self-respect essential to
respectability" (ibid., p. 73).

Thomas McKay, who built the masonry of the Lachine and Rideau Canals,
is quoted as writing in 1837 "that during the first five years he employed
from 100 to 300 men, 2/3 of whom were from Ireland, & that he never ex¬
perienced any difficulty in keeping them quiet. During the second five year
period he employed from 40 to 50 men & never saw or heard a quarrel
among them" (L. Breault, Ottawa Old and New [Ottawa, 1946], p. 63) How¬
ever, these may have been predominantly Ulstermen. Employers and officials
who gave evidence in connection with the strikes of Irish Catholic labourers
in Canada, in 1843, were inclined to say that the Irish were unmanageable
by nature. However, the Paymaster of the Board of Works testified that
during the previous year when the labourers had been employed directly
u Board of Works rather than by contractors, had been paid 3s. a day,
and that in cash rather than store pay, and when some provision was made
for shanties to house the men, the workmen were extremely well behaved
Two priests gave evidence to the same effect (Sessional Papers, 1843, app.
T). Clapham noted that in 1826 the Irish in England were held to be "most
exemplary" labourers, even when starving (Economic History of Modern Britain:
The Early Railway Age, p. 58).

51 McTaggart, Three Years in Canada, vol. II, pp. 243, 245, 248. McTaggart was
Chief Clerk on the Rideau Canal until June 1828. He did not like the Irish,
but his description seems accurate enough. The "houses" pictured on the
Ottawa tally closely with Irish huts of the nineteenth, and also of the
seventeenth, century. (O'Brien, Economic History of Ireland in the Seventeenth
Century, pp. 137-42). The man in charge of the Rideau Canal, Colonel John
By, was a paternalistic (and dictatorial) employer who tried to provide
services for his workmen. On the other hand, Rideau conditions were es¬
pecially conducive to disease and accidents. Several hundred labourers died
there of malaria.

Industry was much smaller in 1838 than in 1837, probably because immi¬
gration was very small (U.C.S., Mar. 13, 1839 [Second Annual Report of
the House of Industry]). In subsequent years, the House of Industry often
reported that it could not care for all indigents and appealed for more
funds.

asserted (Ireland and Irish Emigration, p. 364) that the Irish share in crime in
the United States was less than might have been expected and that only

74 “As long as emigration was restricted, wages for unskilled labor in Canada
were high     - four shillings a day or more in Quebec     - but with the coming
of arge numbers they sank to an average of between 2s. 6d. and 3s. 6d„ and
only two shillings on government contracts, which was somewhat lower
than the average in the United States" (Adams, Ireland and b,sh Emigration, p.
179) The principle is right. The wage rates cited cannot be supported very
tar, tor one thing, because there was considerable variation from time to
time and from Place to place. However, it would not be far out to say that the
tyPical daily wage for labourers in Canada was 3s. 6d. before immigration
became heavy, and 2s. 6d. afterwards.

78J.F. Maguire, The Irish in America (London, 1868), pp. 5-6, 92-93, 98. Similar¬
ly in cities in the United States, it was declared that "Irish labourers, who
save a few pounds, enter into some street trading, take a store, and their
sons become respectable merchants, a process we never observe in
Manchester (Sidney Smith, The Settler's New Home or the Emigrant's Location

[London, 1849], p. 77).

/9The wave-like impact of new sets of immigrants was more continuous and
perhaPs more obvious in the United States than in Canada. See Hansen,
The Immigrant in American History, pp. 157-73, 201. Ethnic distinctions permit
interesting permutations in labour practice. Occasionally an ethnically
unified working class can exploit ethnic or other differences among
employers. A situation in which employers and employees were of the
same minority group facilitated mature collective bargaining in the gar¬
ment trades. French-Canadian workmen have occasionally been able to
force employers of their own ethnic group to be wage leaders; but more
commonly it is employers who exploit ethnic ties to remain wage laggards.

80 Hansen struck at the superficiality of ethnic characteristics by comparing
behaviour of identical immigrants in different overseas environments (ibid.,
pp. 23-25). The remarkably different behaviour of seemingly identical
immigrant groups which hit upon different occupations deserves equal
attention.

81 Montreal artificers at Kingston in 1816 (about half French) and Kingston
shipwrights in 1819 (about 20 per cent French) appear to have got on
together harmoniously (U.C.S., June 12, 1816 [Owen to Gore, petition of
artificers] and June 1, 1819 [petition of shipwrights]). Kingston shoemakers
who petitioned in 1822 included, apparently, one Italian, at least one
Frenchman and half a dozen southern Irish (U.C.S., Oct. 1, 1822). Even in
1842, when Kingston's mechanics (primarily carpenters and joiners)

Petitions do not guarantee against ethnic cleavage; but they imply the
power of occupational interest to overcome it.

sz Some writers have remarked the reinforcement of Canadian Reformers by
radical British immigrants, which no doubt occurred. But the Rebellion of
1837 made plain how profoundly conservative most immigrants were.
Immigrants, especially primitive ones, seem always to have been con¬
servatives. See Hansen, The Immigrant in American History, p. 83 ff.

83 As early as 1820 an immigrant accused the Americans of Upper Canada of
showing hatred for English and Irish immigrants. It was for this reason,
and to defend themselves, that the immigrants "begin to form societies
amongst themselves .. " (An English Settler, A Few Plain Directions for Persons

###### "It was claimed that 30,000 immigrants were settled in Upper Canada in
1831 (Ql98, pt. 2, p. 391). This was an exceptional year for immigration
and employment. But for the population of Upper Canada to expand at the
rate it evidently did, about twenty thousand immigrants a year must have
settled in the 1830s and 1840s, on average.

104 References to the number of labourers arriving on various public works
suggest that at least ten thousand labourers entered from the United
States, going mostly to the Welland and Lachine-Beauharnois Canals.
Moorhouse, "Canadian Migration in the Forties", p. 327, offers estimates
of the gross and net flows across the Canadian-United States border in the
1840s. She shows only 6,000 entering Canada in 1842, few in 1843, but
5,000 in 1844. Since she shows substantial movements in the other direc¬
tion, she calculated a net movement to Canada of only 2,500, even in these
years (1842-44). The significance of this movement does not lie so much in
numbers involved, as in the reversal of a flow on which Canada normally
depended to match its immigration with the demand for labour.

105 For example, P.5.O., C.W., 1841-3, no. 712 (Report of the House of
Industry, Toronto). A common Irish expedient to fend off starvation,
much used in these years, was to sell liquor without a licence to do so (e.g.
P.S.O., C.W.,1840-1, nos. 3162, 3195, 3163).

108 Hansen and Brebner, The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples, pp.
113-18. Statistics on immigration are consistent with the "congestion"
thesis. Canada took over 250,000 immigrants during the 1830s. The
number for the 1840s is only 100,000 larger, at 350,000, which should have
been an easy number for a larger economy to handle if it was in good health.
Yet evidences of difficulty in absorption are more common in the 1840s,
quite aside from the famine migration.

109Ibid., p. 135. It is extremely difficult to account for the divergent growth
patterns of the United States and Canada without assigning high impor¬
tance to the continuous agricultural frontier in the United States as against
the interrupted one in Canada. Cf. John H. Young, "Comparative Econo¬
mic Development: Canada and the United States", American Economic Review,
Papers and Proceedings, vol. XLV, no. 2 (May 1955), especially pp. 83-84.

been the Irish who were on the way in.

These men were employed directly by the Board of Works. Killaly wrote,
somewhat inaccurately, "the novel feature in this case [is] that it originated
with the Canadian labourers,- and not with the Strangers, and that the
ring-leaders are known." Killaly thought it improper to grant the demands
of the strikers, but impolitic to prosecute the strike leaders, since Irish
strike leaders had never been prosecuted because the authorities had never
discovered their identity. What the Board of Works did to deal with this
strike was to suspend the work indefinitely.

besides employing strike-breakers, the contractor involved had in mind to
replace all the Irish with French labourers. The Irish had every reason to
think, therefore, that they were being robbed of their victory and defrau¬
ded under their agreement with the contractor. The opinion of a police
officer on these tactics was:

This, as will be found, will also fail, from the circumstance of the Cana¬
dians, who are a quiet, timid, people, being alarmed at coming into
collision with the discharged Irish, of whom they have a great dread;
thus the work will be stopped. Even supposing the Irish should leave
the work quietly, it will only be to proceed to Beauharnois to get work
on the Canal there; and where the same scenes will be re-enacted de
novo.. .(C60, p. 63).
There was, indeed, another ethnic clash at Beauharnois in August 1843.
The police were supposed to prevent further ones (Quebec Gazette,
Aug. 23, 1843; Montreal Transcript, Aug 1843).

134 Most of the information about Orangeism in this area appears in letters
from William Morris, who constantly urged more drastic action against it.
In August 1825, when he first wrote, he stated that the Perth lodge was
established "about two years ago" (U.C.S., Aug. 13, 1825 [Morris to
Hillier]). A letter of May 1830 said it was formed "about 6 years" before
(U.C.S., May 27, 1830 [Morris to Colborne]). Long afterwards, Morris
suggested that Orangeism arose partly in consequence of a fight among
militia companies at Ramsay in 1824 (P.S.O., C.W., 1840-1, no. 1792

[Morris to P.S., Aug. 10, 1840; with no. 2899?]). There was indeed a fight at
Ramsay in April 1824 between the "Scotch" and "Irish" (mostly Robinson
settlers?) companies but the investigation of it implies that the Irish party
included both Protestants and Catholics (U.C.S., May 20, 1824 [statement
of Fitzmaurice and others; enclosure]).

135U.C.S., May 27, 1830 (Morris to Colborne). Matheson had been removed
from his office on Morris's complaints.

136 This circular urged unity between Protestant and Catholic Irish. It is dated
June 18, 1826, but appears in U.C.S., April 18, 1826; and again July (n.d.)
1836 (Fitzgibbon to Joseph, enclosure). Fitzgibbon had a part in the inquiry
into the Ramsay riot.

140 U.C.S., Sept. 17, 1827 (Macdonell to Hillier); Jan. 21, 1828 (Fraser to
Hillier). The second letter reported that a new Orange lodge had been
formed by a person who had recently come from Ireland expressly to or¬
ganize lodges. It is not clear whether this refers to a first or second lodge in
Kingston.

141 The circular seems to have been issued at the instigation of Morris (U.C.S.,
May 27, 1830 [Morris to Colborne]) and one Maguire, a Roman Catholic
magistrate in the Robinson settlement in Cavan (U.C.S., July 5, 1830

[Maguire to Bergin]). Subsequently, Maguire was accused of having
fomented most of the Orange-Green trouble (U.C.S., June 1 [should be July
1] 1831 [Huston to McMahon]; June 29, 1831 [Elliott to McMahon]; July 7,
1831 [Brown to McMahon]). On the consolidation of Orange lodges in
the east, see Mood, "The Orange Order in Canadian Politics", p. 9.

Politics", pp. 10n., 98, 165. The figure for 1846 was given in George
Benjamin's Belleville Intelligencer & Victoria Advertiser (P.5.0., C.W., 1846, no.

146 As a government project, the Robinson settlements were well documen¬
ted, and accounts appear in all works on emigration and settlement. The
Catholics were settled in the rear concessions of the township of Emily,
with wild land between them and Protestant Irish who had settled before
1820 in Cavan and the first four concessions of Emily. (J.H. Aitchison, "The
Development of Local Government in Upper Canada, 1783-1850", p. 197.)

147li.C.S., June 15, 1831 (Maguire to O'Grady); July 7, 1831 (Brown to
McMahon). There are supposed to have been a thousand Orangemen in
York in 1833 .(Saunders, The Story of Orangeism, p. 22); but Toronto Orange-
ism does not seem really to have flourished until after an election battle
between Orange and Green in 1841. Early apathy is indicated in H.
Lovelock, "Reminiscences of Toronto Orangeism", Official Orange Souvenir,
Toronto, July 12, 1902 (pamphlet).

li9lbid., pp. 103, 106, 165, 168. It is asserted that even in 1860 less than a
quarter of the Orangemen in Canada West were west of Oshawa.

150 For example, P.S.O., C.W., 1850, ho. 620 (also C3I7, pp. 219-21, 234), July
12, 1849 clash between Orangemen and canal labourers in St. Catharines;
nos. 1344 and 1378, July 12, 1850 clash between Orangemen and labourers
at Brantford, and subsequent prosecution of Orangemen under the law of
1843. In P.S.O., C. W., 1851, no. 788, Benjamin proposed repeal of the law
against Orange processions on the ground that it had provoked the holding
of more processions than before.

151 Opponents, of course, used the same device and maximized the threat of
Orangeism. Orangemen were frequently accused of keeping their
opponents from the polls by force at elections (P.S.O., C.W., 1840-1, nos.
3323, 3339, 3345) but others did this also when they could. With respect to
local offices, "the truth is that the Orange Society are endeavouring to con¬
trol all our Township affairs. No appointment can take place, even as
Teachers of Common Schools, or any Township Office where trust and
responsibility is required, but their Secret influence is immediately called
into Action and the Nominees of their Leaders, are supported and carried
in, whether qualified by education fitness or otherwise — frequently the
exclusion of many good and loyal subjects..." (P.S.O., C.W. 1843-4, no.
7062. Memorial of S. Walford, village of Bolton, Jan. 21, 1844). Even while
local government was carried on entirely by appointed magistrates, there
was a great deal of trouble, especially because governors did not appoint
enough' magistrates and showed a marked partiality for recent British
immigrants (Aitchison, "The Development of Local Government in Upper
Canada, 1783-1850", pp. 60-68). It is notable that Gowan came out in 1839
in favour of the Reform objective of elected local officers; for one thing, no
doubt, because he was confident that the Orange Order could elect a great
many of them (ibid., p. 82). Tory opposition to the secret ballot presumably


-----

reflected, in part, the fact that the Orange machine functioned better with
open elections (ibid., p. 577).

2 What the Orangemen seem to have meant was that they were prepared to
have their organized Protestant body coexist peacefully alongside an
organized Catholic body; but they wanted Catholics kept in their place.
They did not propose to have Catholics overrun and dominate them.
Where the Catholics' place was well defined, as in Lower Canada, this
arrangement worked well enough. It was the undetermined position of
Irish Catholics in Upper Canada that gave trouble.

153 LI.C.S., July 1, 1834 (Gowan to Rowan). According to Gowan, the popula¬
tion at the front of Leeds consisted of disloyal Americans; but the four-
fifths in back locations were loyal British immigrants, mostly disfranchised
because polling places for elections were at the front. There was a vendetta
between Gowan and local American" officials: Gowan charged systematic
persecution by prosecutions of himself and his friends on various trumped-
up charges (U.C.S., July 4, 1833 [Gowan's memorial]; Feb. 10, 1834 [Gowan
to Colborne]).

157 The Irish Catholics offered as a reason for their refusal to come forward in
1837 the partiality of the government towards Orangemen. The indefa-
tiguable Morris used this as a further reason why Orangeism should be
discouraged. The government proceeded to discourage Orangeism quiet¬
ly—i.e., by refusing offices to known Orangemen (P.S.O., C.W., no. 1792

[Morris to P.S., Aug. 10, 1840 and enclosure]). The Irish Catholics also
maintained neutrality in 1849 (Doughty, Elgin-Grey Papers, vol. I. p. 412).

8 These places tended to leap to an economy of service industries without
much of a manufacturing stage either. Manufactures rose in New England
with the support of commerce; in the Netherlands as a means of livelihood
when service industries declined; while in Nova Scotia they have not had a
strong development at any time.

0 Limitations of this kind appear to form the basis of Professor W.L.
Morton's concept of "northern" economies.

10N.S.D. Gras produced and generalized a theory of economic development
not far removed from the present one in his studies of metropolitan evolu¬
tion. The starting point for his conception of metropolitan growth (of
London) was his Evolution of the English Corn Market (1915), in which he
stressed the strength of local agriculture as the first condition for a metro¬
polis. This same consideration promoted his History of Agriculture in Europe and
America (1925) and several other works relating to agriculture. Cf. also
Gras, An Introduction to Economic History (1922).
n The trade seems to have taken about 500 men in 1681 (population about
10,000); about 1,000 men in 1720 (population about 25,000); and 2,000 men
in 1750 (population about 50,000); though one estimate of 1758 put the
number drawn by the fur trade at 4,000 (H.A. Innis, The Fur Trade in Canada,
pp. 62-67, 103-4, 115; Lunn, "Economic Development in New France,
1713-1760", p. 109). Cf. A.L. Burt, The Old Province of Quebec (Toronto,

12 It is true that agriculture served as an auxiliary and reserve supplying food
and men for the fur trade. However, state policy was directed to make
agriculture the primary and independent economic foundation of New
France and, on the whole, succeeded.

13 Upper Canada House of Assembly, First Report of the Select Committee appointed to
inquire into the state of Trade and Commerce of the Province of Upper Canada, 183 5: "On
the shores of Lake Ontario it [the cost of producing wheat] ranges from
half a dollar to three shillings: Eastward, in Glengarry and the Ottawa, it
rises from 3s. to 3/9; and westward, in the Gore and London districts, falls
to between half a dollar and 2 shillings in our currency."

14 Cl08 (P.A.C.), p. 127 ff., R. Hamilton to Major James Green, June 11,1803.

15 Loc. cit.

10 Cl05, p. 11, indicates that in 1791 it was already the established custom, in
buying local flour for the up-country garrisons, to pay a premium over the
Lower Canadian price reflecting at least a part of the cost of transport.
Cl05, pp. 133, 143, 150, 154, 173, are correspondence concerning the
feeding of the garrisons in 1797. In that year, the army tried to exploit the
position of a monopsonist, with some success against the farmers around
Kingston, but was soundly defeated on the Niagara and Detroit frontiers
by the competitive buying of the Americans, who also had garrisons on the
frontiers to feed and paid up to 50 per cent more than the highest price that
the British purchasing agent was authorized to pay. Cl05, p. 146, indicates
that there were 2,200 troops in Upper Canada to be fed and 1,000 more at
"outposts" out of a total force in Canada of 5,800, and also sets out the daily
ration of flour, pork, peas, beef, etc. that had to be found for them. Cl05,
pp. 186-87, sets out a purchasing policy that concedes that prices have to
be somewhat higher as one proceeds westward. Cl09, pp. 47-48, is a state¬
ment of the prices paid for supplies to the army of flour, peas and pork,
1799-1803, in Lower and Upper Canada (Kingston, York, Fort George,
Chippewa, Fort Erie, Amherstburg). They indicate maintenance of the
principle that prices were progressively higher in Upper Canada as one
went westward, and show substantially higher prices for all points in Upper
Canada than in Lower Canada in 1799. However, John Craigie, Deputy
Commissary General, appears to have achieved his goal of driving down
Upper Canadian prices from 1800 to 1803. The prices reported to be paid
in Upper Canada were somewhat lower than Lower Canadian prices in
1800 and 1801, and substantially lower in 1803 — perhaps because (accord¬
ing to the blanks in the table) the army refrained from buying anything
in Upper Canada in 1802, with the exception of one purchase.

17 In 1842 it was stressed that to support the timber trade it was necessary for
supplies to be drawn from (at least) the Kingston area (P.S.O., C.W., 1841-
3, no. 4860). Sessional Papers, 1847, app. QQ, indicates that in 1846-47 (a big¬
ger year than hitherto) the Ottawa Valley trade employed 11,000 men,
8,600 horses, 2,200 oxen, and required 30,000 bbls. of flour, 27,000 bbls. of
pork, 450,000 bus. of oats and 11,000 tons of hay.

years. High prices have had a marvellous effect... As an illustration we
may take Toronto markets, and trace the effects of high prices among
many of the smaller farmers of that neighborhood. The illustration will
hold good for every other town and village in the country ... Again it may
be observed that during the past two years the value of every kind of farm
produce has risen in the same proportion as products adapted for exporta¬
tion ..." (Scobie and Balfour, Canadian Almanac, 1856). The 1857 Almanac
contained a glowing account of the effect of railways. It stated that lumber
could not be carried economically by road for more than 40 miles, but that
railways made it pay. Also, "Now... at every station, fruit, butter, eggs and
vegetables command a ready cash sale. The price of firewood has risen
considerably..." Adam Shortt stated that production could not satisfy
home demand in this period, and that food was imported heavily from the
United States ("Railway Construction and National Prosperity: An His¬
toric Parallel", Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, 1914, pp. 303-4).

22H.C. Pentland, "The Role of Capital in Canadian Economic Development

25 With the qualification that the merchant made every effort to channel
trade through his city (until he abondoned it) rather than any competing
city.

26 The outlook of the merchants who came to Canada after 1759 is revealed in
"A Friend of Trade", The True Interest of Great-Britain in Regard to the Trade and
Government of Canada, Newfoundland, and the Coast of Labrador (London, 1767)
(P.A.C., Pamphlet I, no. 415) and "An Old and Experienced Trader"
(Alexander Cluny), The American Traveller: or, Observations on the Present State,
Culture, and Commerce of the British Colonies in America (London, 1769) (P.A.C.,
Pamphlet no. 427).

27 Merchants of the American colonies generally opposed local development,
even though they were its beneficiaries in many ways. Even in so diversi¬
fied an economy as that of Massachusetts, merchants were against home
manufactures and measures to encourage them. On the other hand, there
were always some Massachusetts merchants who joined with farmers and
artisans to promote manufactures — sometimes, no doubt, because they
intended to invest in them — and doctrines of the "economy of high
wages", the reflection of an integrated economy primarily dependent on
the home market, were advanced periodically. Such views were conspicu¬
ously absent from the St. Lawrence region. Cf. O. and M. Handlin, Common¬
wealth: A Study of the Role of Government in the American Economy: Massachusetts,
1774-1861 (New York, 1947), especially pp. 38-39, 111, 131, 197.

30 Government conscription of shipyard workers at Quebec in 1763 is noted
in British Museum, Additional MSS, M377 (P.A.C.), p. 12 (Christie vs Knipe
and Le Queusne). Conscription and other means of regulation were used to
re-establish the St. Maurice Forges, 1760-63 (Suite, "Les Forges Saint-
Maurice", p. 130-39). Conscription of men to serve on bateaux was
common and the cause of bitter clashes between habitants and the govern¬
ment (e.g., S Series [Lower Canada Sundries] Oct. 12, 1765 [Christie to
Burton]; Oct. 13, 1765 [Christie to Burton]; Oct. 13, 1765 [La Goterie to
Christie]). Regulation of the price of bread was long continued in Quebec
and Montreal and the Legislature wanted regulation extended in area and
scope (Lower Canada, Journals of the Assembly, 1814, pp. 12, 24, 26, 110-12;
1815, pp. 152, 322-26, 440). The persistence of support for regulation is
suggested by the occurrence in Quebec in 1855 of "bread riots" against a
combine that had raised bread prices by 20 per cent (Montreal Gazette, Jan
11, 1855).

31 Military authorities opposed canals along the exposed portions of the St.
Lawrence and the Welland Canal, as well as industrial development near
the frontier, all of which they thought too exposed to American attack, in
spite of mercantile desires to strengthen the position of the St. Lawrence in
the interior market. Cf. J.L. McDougall, "The Welland Canal to 1841"
(M.A. thesis. University of Toronto, 1923), pp. 7-9.

and Canadian attitudes.

33 The Force documents, aside from revealing the activity of some merchants
who were wholehearted supporters of the Revolution, suggest that the
rest of the mercantile community would have been ready enough to sup¬
port it too: "Their [the Canadians'] minds are all poisoned by emissaries
from New-England and the damned rascals of merchants here and at
Montreal..." (Gamble to General Gage, Sept. 6, 1775, Force, American

43 The improvement of Montreal's harbour is examined in L.C. Tombs, The
Port of Montreal (Toronto, 1926). In H.Y. Hind, ed., Eighty Years' Progress of
British North America ... (Toronto, 1863), Thomas Keefer discussed the prob¬
lem of dredging Lake St. Peter (pp. 165-66) and the attempt to strengthen
Montreal by subsidization of the Allan line (pp. 142-45), a step that re¬
flected contemporary Canadian annoyance with the British government's
subsidization of New York. The same author noted in another work that in
sfjite of all the difficulties, St. Lawrence traffic increased more than New
York's between 1820 and 1840, as measured by tonnage of vessels (T.C.
Keefer, The Canals of Canada: their Prospects and Influence [Toronto, 1850], pp.
30-31, 44). New York, of course, was also improving its canals, and had the
power to lower its canal tolls when competition threatened to become
serious, so that rates on both lines fell considerably (G.P. de T. Glazebrook,
A History of Transportation in Canada [Toronto, 1938], pp. 89-97). The net
effect was that rates on the St. Lawrence were less than half of Erie rates in
1849. (G.N. Tucker, The Canadian Commercial Revolution, 1845-1851 [New
Haven, 1936], pp. 55, 58).

46 It was New York's power to engross the wheat of the Midwest through its
command of the water route to Chicago that led to its own local agricultur¬
al base being turned to dairying and stock-raising (Pooley, op. cit., pp. 339-
43). The St. Lawrence valley did not complete this transition until about a
half-century later.

It is interesting to compare the rivalry between New York and Montreal
with that between Montreal and Hudson's Bay — Montreal in the second
case taking the role of New York as the port with a well-developed hinter¬
land, by which it was able to command better shipping services and rates,
notwithstanding its greater distance from Europe. In respect to the rivalry
of the fur trade, Hudson s Bay was able to win. This may mean that ocean
shipping costs were of little consequence in the fur trade as against interior
shipping costs; though it may be that Montreal could have continued to
compete strongly after 1821 if monopoly had not intervened. In the twen¬
tieth century, the Hudson s Bay route has been unable to offer serious
competition to Montreal precisely because of those economic disadvan¬
tages of a port catering to staple exports, and the political weakness of a
port with a weak hinterland, that defeated Montreal in its contest with
New York.

50 There has been a decided movement to reinterpret British policy in the
nineteenth century in respect to free trade and to laissez faire in general.
On free trade, see J. Gallagher and R. Robinson, "The Imperialism of Free
Trade , Economic History Review, Aug. 1953, pp. 1-15. In respect to general
policy, it has been argued that public policy in nineteenth-century Britain
was interventionist and hostile to an earlier laissez faire attitude. Cf. E.
Lipson, The Growth of English Society (New York, 1953), ch. X. Cf. also the
reinterpretation of Bentham in J.B. Brebner, "Laissez-Faire and State In¬
tervention in Nineteenth Century Britain," Tasks of Economic History (Supple¬
ment to the Journal of Economic History), no. VIII (1948), p. 59-73.

America (New York, 1942), pp. 57-62. John R. Commons considered the new
competition to be a vital factor in the growth of union";, especially of

those of a better sort manufactured and imported from Great Britain”
(Murray's Report, 1762).

58 In 1843, the Colonial Secretary had opposed duties that provided protec¬
tive differentials and forbidden governors to assent to them. In 1846,
Secretary Gladstone urged that Canadian duties be lowered, Liverpool
interests protested the Canadian duties of 1845 which favoured raw as
against refined sugar imports, and the British government demanded that
no goods which Canada had usually imported from Britain should be taxed
more than formerly (E.C.O., 1846, nos. 530, 1584, 1615). Sessional Papers,
1849, app. N, covers among other things numerous protests from Britain
against Canada's "prohibitive" new tariff of 12Vi per cent on many manu¬
factured products. In respect to money, following the attempt to keep
Canadian banks to gold payments in 1837, there may be noticed the
Colonial Secretary's opposition to a Provincial Act to raise £100,000 in
small notes in 1839 (Upper Canada, Journals of the Assembly, 1839, Appendix
vol. II, part II, p. 553), the extremely restrictive advice of Gladstone upon
the proper principles of banking (E.C.O., 1846, no. 1733, and Sessional Papers,
1847, app. W), and British objection to any extension of the power granted
in 1842 to Canadian banks to issue 5 shilling notes (E.C.O., 1847, no. 94).

281). This is a vivid account of the difficulties in New France when it was
isolated by war, 1744-48 and 1755-59. It indicates that the supply of
industrial products was not elastic enough for New France to achieve self-
sufficiency. With the disruption of imports, industrial products became
scarcer and scarcer until the farmers, the only persons who had real goods,
refused any longer to take paper money which could not buy the articles
they wanted.

Exhibition at Toronto, 1858, by the President, William Ferguson, Esq., of Kingston,
C.W. (Toronto, n.d.) (uncatalogued pamphlet, P.A.C.).

70 Lake shippers were occasionally protected against American competitors,
as in 1823 (U.C.S., July 15, 1823 [Crooks to Hillier]; July 26, 1823 [John B.
Robinson to Hillier]), but their interest was usually ignored. Shipowners
and sailors asked protection in 1845 (P.S.O., C.W., 1844-5, no. 9420).
Professional men and beneficiaries of patent grants had special protection¬
ist interests. The Canadian government sought and received power over
copyright in 1846 (E.C.O., 1846, no. 2799).

71 W.H. Merritt sought protection for his new salt works in 1818 (U.C.S., Oct.
23, 1818). In 1819, Kingston shipwrights asked protection from persons
who bought American vessels and used them in the Canadian coasting
trade (L/. C.S., June 1,1819). However, the "inhabitants of Kingston" object¬
ed to the high prices of foods occasioned by the agricultural protection of
1822 (U.C.S., n.d. [Nov.], 1823). A bounty appears to have been used to
assist a new paper mill in 1826 (U.C.S., June 6, 1826).

72 The history of Canadian tariffs in this period is set out in McDiarmid,
Commercial Policy in the Canadian Economy, p. 28 ff. The philosophy of tariff
legislation, in particular reference to a 30 per cent duty on paper, was
expressed in 1840 as "intended to check foreign importations prejudicial to
our domestic manufacture, and the consumption of British paper" (P.S.O.,
C.W., 1840, no. 1173 [the opinion of J.W. Macaulay, Inspector General]).
Canadian and British interests were thus harmonized.

73 Sir Arthur Helps, Life and Labours of Mr. Brassey, 1805-1870 (3rd ed., London,
1872), pp. 186-95. McDiarmid expressed the contrary opinion that British
manufactures were too competitive to be much affected by Canadian
tariffs of the 1840s (op. cit., p. 67).

United States, instead of the 15 per cent duty proposed to 1842, alleging
strong competition from American iron producers.

tory in this instance, contrary to Fowke, Canadian Agricultural Policy, p. 92.

interests were divided at this tjme. Montreal favoured, while Toronto op¬
posed, differential duties to promote importation by the St. Lawrence
rather than the American border, and won its point at the price of general
protection. Montreal was provoked by American drawback legislation,
which Toronto did not find objectionable (P.S.O., C.W., 1844-5, nos. 10116
and 10121). The British government had vetoed protective differentials in
1843, and demanded in connection with the 1845 tariffs that British goods
customarily imported into Canada should not be taxed more than formerly

(E.C.O., 1846, no. 1615). It is worth observation that the British govern¬
ment, Montreal and Toronto were all concerned with special advantage,
and not at all with freer trade or any other principle.

81McDiarmid, op. cit., p. 56. E.C.O. 1846, no. 530 contains Gladstone's objec¬
tions to protection. Ibid., no. 1584 conveys the protest of Liverpool refiners
to a Canadian duty of 2d. per lb. on refined sugar, but only id. on raw
sugar. Ibid., no. 2698 contains Grey's objections to discrimination.

82 There is a valuable discussion of the British American League in Donald
Creighton, John A. Macdonald; The Young Politician (Toronto, 1952), pp. 142-
45, and a great deal of information about it is scattered through Doughty,
Elgin-Grey Papers. For R.B. Sullivan's speech at Hamilton in November 1847
"on the connection between agriculture and manufactures of Canada",
sometimes credited with launching the protectionist movement as a serious
force in Canada, see E. Porritt, Sixty Years of Protection in Canada, 1846-1907
(London, 1908), pp. 199-201. Elgin reported the great growth of protection¬
ist sentiment in Canada under "British party" auspices at least as early as
Jan. 4, 1849 — a development used by Hincks to argue for final repeal of
the Navigation Acts (Elgin-Grey Papers, vol. I, pp. 280, 285). The Annexation¬
ist Manifesto appears in ibid., vol. IV, pp. 1487-94 and as an appendix to
Tucker, Th° Canadian Commercial Revolution, p. 227. Its author dismissed "the
protection of home manufactures" as a remedy: "Although this might
encourage the growth of a manufacturing interest in Canada, yet, without
access to the United States market, there would not be a sufficient ex¬
pansion of that interest, for the want of consumers, to work any result
that could be admitted as a 'remedy' for the numerous evils of which we
complain." Cf. also Samuel Thompson, Reminiscences of a Canadian Pioneer
(Toronto, 1884), pp. 245-51.

83Sessional Papers, 1849, app. N. The complaints, from interested parties in
Britain, were against the increase of Canadian duties in 1849 to 1214 per
cent on leather and leather goods, paper, hardware (scythes, axes, cas¬
tings), cottons, linens, woollens and silks. But there were interested pro¬
ducers of all these in Canada, except for linens and silks.

84P.S.O., C.W., 1849, no. 426 (Johnstown District Council, Feb. 1849). Ibid.,
nos. 489 (Gananoque public meeting) and 522 (Colborne District Council)
are similar and appeared at the same time. Probably all were inspired by
Ogle R. Gowan and connected with the agitation that produced the British
American League. However the Colborne resolution, unlike the others,
seemed to favour Canadian protection primarily as a bargaining weapon to
win reciprocity from the United States.

85 French-Canadian thought and policy received a careful and illuminating
treatment in J.I. Cooper, "French-Canadian Conservatism in Principle and
in Practice, 1873-1891". On vacillations of policy, see especially pp. 530-33.

88 Cf. C.E. Rouleau, L'Emigration: ses principals causes.


-----

87 Colonization plans of 1848 appear in Elgin-Grey Papers, vol. IV, pp. 1361-72.

Colonization more generally was examined by Cooper, op. cit., passim.
Cooper makes the point that industrialization was also seen not as an
alternative but as a necessary base (market) for colonization (p. 539). This
would imply a goal of a self-contained economy, with rural and urban parts
interdependent. However, there was also desire to preserve the structure
portrayed in Horace Miner, St. Denis: A French-Canadian Parish (Chicago
1939). 6

88 The emphasis on sacrifice may be explained by the fact that those who had
recently moved in Lower Canada, to the Eastern Townships and to Gaspe,
were especially likely to emigrate. Reluctance to accept hardship thus
struck at the base of the whole colonization program.

Causes and Importance of The Emigration which takes place annually, from Lower Canada

This attack on the seigneurs appears to foreshadow the end of Seigneurial
Tenure.

91 The Canadian mining boom of the 1840s was promoted by a large-scale
search for copper in the Lake Superior region of the United States which
began in 1842, and by information gathered by the Canadian Geological
Survey, which also began in 1842. The first licence to explore was granted
in 1845, and a rush soon followed. By 1847, the government had worked
out a policy for handling mining claims. By the end of 1848, twenty-two
mining locations had been taken up, and the most important one, Bruce
Mines (Montreal Mining Company), was employing 163 men. See Sessional
Papers, 1847, app. AAA and E.C.O., 1849, no. 80; also Innis and Lower, Select
Documents, 1783-1885, pp. 580-81, 585-86.

92 This transformation was discussed in Pentland, "The Role of Capital in
Canadian Economic Development before 1875," especially pp. 466-67. A
specific example of a manufacture (of cement) directly promoted and
financed by canal construction appears in the questionable record of one,
Norton, a Commissioner for the Cornwall Canal (U.C.S., Sept. 11, 1838

[Hume to McDonald]).

93 In November 1844, the Executive Council concurred with the opinion of
the President of the Board of Works that "water privileges" created by
canal construction ought to be leased for periods up to 50 years (P.S.O.,
C.VJ., 1844-5, no. 8872). Some leases are noted in P.S.O., C.W., 1846-7, no.
16785 (Cornwall Canal, May 1847); no. 16846 (Williamsburg Canal, June
1847); no. 17122 (Welland Canal, June 1847). It is stated that mill sites are
being eagerly sought in P.S.O., C.W., 1847-8, no. 18393 (November 1847).

industry, that industry would develop better on a small rather than large
scale, but that existing mills were inefficient and ought to be forced to
modernize.

centrated here.

104 In 1811, it was reported that a tenth of the persons in Boucherville were
available for hire as servants at 7s., 6d. per month (Baby Collection [P.A.C.],
vol. 3, no. 372 [Viger to Berczy, Oct. 7,1811]). Generally in the nineteenth
century, the towns of the lower province seem to have more and more
become repositories for useless persons, rather than active economic
entities.

106 The machinery question in the 1850s centred around the sewing machine,
which Toronto tailors drove out of their city in 1851. The Globe neverthe¬
less did not hesitate to point out that it was "impossible to prevent the
encroachment of machinery", that employers must use the machines to
meet competition, that those displaced by machines faced a world full of
opportunities, and so forth (Toronto Globe, Dec. 7, 1852). The Toronto
Leader, not always on the same side, had much the same opinion, that
machines were inevitable and desirable, and that the "crusade against
sewing machines" of the Hamilton tailors in 1854 was mad, evil and
doomed to failure (Toronto Leader, July 12, 1853; Aug. 30, 1853; Feb. 15,
1854). The less sophisticated were deeply concerned about machines as a
cause of unemployment (not employment). The displacement of farm
labourers by threshing machines since about 1840 was given as an impor¬
tant cause of emigration in the 1849 Report. One of the pleas for protection
of the 1840s was directed against the importation of American machinery
which was alleged to be putting building tradesmen out of employment in
Kingston (P.S.O., C.W., 1841-3, no. 3226).

Galt, Belleville, Colborne, Merrickville, Niagara, Oshawa, Newcastle

products.

118 Historians have inclined to take as evidence of disinterest in protection
what appears to be a deliberate tactic. Porritt claimed that there was little
support for protection between 1859 and 1876 (op. cit., pp. 261, 266). Clark
noted that tariffs were lowered to bring the Maritimes into Confederation,
and takes this to mean that "Confederation, by emphasizing the demands
of the trading interests and railway promoters, temporarily halted the
movement towards protection. On questions of trade policy, the impor¬
ting and transportation enterpreneurs of Montreal combined with the
frontier agricultural vote to resist the imposition of a protective tariff" (op.
cit., pp. 3n, 4). Creighton has stated the view that few wanted a protective
policy in 1867, though he also cited examples of the premonition that it
would come ("British North America at Confederation", pp. 42-43). W.A.
Mackintosh took much the same view of prevailing opinion, but treated
protection as implicit in the Confederation decision ("The Economic Back¬
ground of Dominion-Provincial Relations", Royal Commission on
Dominion-Provincial Relations, appendix 3 [Ottawa, 1939], p. 17). It is diffi¬
cult to imagine that intelligent observers were unaware that an east-west
economic structure implied protection, or that protection would be
resumed.

119 Porritt, op.cit., pp. 263, 275-76. Protectionist sentiment was not only rising
in Canada West at this time, but became very strong in Canada East
because of the rapid increase of emigration. Cf. Cooper, "Some Early
French-Canadian Advocacy of Protection, 1871-1873".

trade were published in The Phtriotic Party versus the Cosmopolite Party; or, in other
words, Reciprocal Free Trade versus Irreciprocal Free Trade (Toronto, 1848) and
British American Federation a Necessity, its Industrial Policy a Necessity (Hamilton,
1865).

124 The phrase, "full employment" was used both by Buchanan and by Horace
Greeley, whom he much admired. In a letter to the president of the
Hamilton Cooperative Association (Feb. 8, 1866), Buchanan proposed to
relieve unemployment by issuing money "enough to enable Employers to
have the means of employing every man able and willing to work." A
particularly far-reaching monetary program appeared in Buchanan's one-
page address "To the Members of the Currency Convention, Hamilton,
28th October, 1879" (Buchanan Papers, printed).

131 Cf. J.M.S. Careless, "The Toronto Globe and Agrarian Radicalism, 1850-
67", Canadian Historical Review, March 1948, pp. 14-39. It was actually the
Globe whose care for the common man "it seems" was excluded from
city dwellers (p. 34), and Careless makes clear that Brown (or the Globe) was
not much bothered about common farmers either. Some examples of the
Globe's view are:

April 9, 1850 — urged abolition of usury laws.
April 6, 1850 — against any interference by law with the truck system, a
matter of individual contract. Besides, the mechanic "is the most inde¬
pendent man in the country and gets the 'cream of all the good things'."
July 10, 1852 — crowed over loss of the Amalgamated Engineers' strike in
England. The moral is that workers were seeking an "artificial price for
labor" and trying to run the trade.
May 11,1854 — on a Grand Trunk strike: "Supply and demand must regu¬
late the price of labor as of everything else."
Sept. 12, 1867 — applauded a court decision in Britain that outlawed
peaceful picketing.
And still in the 1880s:
March 11, 1882 — on demands that women should receive equal pay with
men for the same work: the law of supply and demand lies behind lower
rates for women, and there is nothing else that can be done about it.
But there was variation in:

gatherings, but one or more appeared at the 1877 meeting of the Canadian
Labour Union, and stoutly opposed protection. However his (their) elo¬
quence did not prevail, and protection was approved by (the Globe said) "a
majority of one or two" (Toronto Globe, Aug. 9, 1877).

2V.H. Jensen, Lumber and Labor (New York and Toronto, 1945), p. 3. This
work deals most competently with the social conditions of lumber workers
and the economics of their industry.

3 An important factor causing returns to staple producers to be low is the
extreme seasonality of their occupations. Lumbering permitted some to
overcome this disability, by working in the woods in winter and elsewhere
in summer, but most staple producers, even in lumbering, remained
unemployed in their off season. The effect of this has been a relatively low
annual productivity. This disadvantage can be overcome by the introduc¬
tion of industries that can operate during all seasons — manufactures —
and it is significant that industrialization has developed chiefly in tem¬
perate regions.

4 The replacement on the Ottawa in the second half of the nineteenth
century of human, equalitarian employers by wealthy, impersonal, gras¬
ping ones who provoked strikes by their meanness and won them by use of
their wealth, is pictured in J.L. Gourlay, History of the Ottawa Valley (n p

behalf of the numerous class with which they stand connected and, hence,
to a certain extent, they are led to attribute the comparative backward state
of our manufactures and mechanical sciences..." (P.5.0., C.W., 1849, no.

Notice of patents of invention also appeared in contemporary newspapers,
and some information has been drawn from that source.

19 This conclusion is drawn on the basis of correspondence concerning dis¬
puted patents, and suits for infringement. This indicates that the common
farm machines were made by numerous village smiths, with more or less
variation in design according to individual taste and capacity.

20 Industrial society also achieved notable economies of scale and "external"
economies other than the external economy of the labour market; but
these economies were not unknown to staple production, and therefore
are not distinctive.

21 These were the chief issues raised by the first and possibly the only number
of "The People's Magazine and Workingman's Friend", published in
Quebec, March 16, 1842 (with P.S.O., C.E., 1842, no. 794).

22 The high valuation placed on skilled labour, and the need to keep the flow
of it from Britain open, is given as the basic reason for the Trade Unions

106-10.

(P.A.C.). A strike of carpenters (the only group that did not strike in 1823)
against the Commission in 1825 turned out in much the same way — that
is, the Commissioners took a strong line against yielding to their workmen,
but the carpenters got what they wanted in a round-about way.

20 A strike of Grand Trunk employees (and others) in Montreal in 1855 for
higher wages produced a compromise settlement (Montreal Gazette, May 5,
1855). In a strike of carters against the Grand Trunk in 1864 in Montreal!
the company offered a compromise but apparently was defeated by public
opinion and legal rulings (Toronto Globe, Oct. 3, Oct. 5, 1864). When Grand
Trunk engineers struck on Dec. 29, 1876 for the principle of seniority in
lay-offs, they won their point. The Toronto Globe, which had been violently
opposed to any acknowledgement that seniority established a claim to
anything, then denounced the General Manager of the Grand Trunk as
weak, undetermined, changeable, etc. (Toronto, Globe, Jan. 7, 1877).

2/ Workingmen may have achieved some immunity to charges of conspiracy
also because lawyers, as a class, were engaged themselves in a conspiracy
at mid-century. Lawyers opposed popular proposals that their fees should
be set by the courts, and the lawyers of Quebec City went on strike in 1850
against the setting of their fees (Toronto North American, Jan. 3, 1851).

28 Sessional Papers, 1843, app. Q. Another argument was that even the lowest
Canadian (daily) wage rates were higher than rates in Europe, on which
people somehow survived. Those who argued this way seem never to have
included comparisons of the cost of living, and of annual incomes, in their
demonstrations.

Canada in 1843 had come over recently from the United States, but usually
the movement was the other way, and Killaly here twisted the facts to win
the argument. But it was also true that Canada had the easy way of getting
rid of surplus labourers by letting them go south — the province had been
cleared of its surplus in this way in 1838.

The Report of a Committee of Executive Council, July 31, 1844, on the
request of a Rev. M. Brethour for payment for spiritual services rendered
to canal labourers (E.C.O.) contains some direct statements: "the employ¬
ment of a Roman Catholic clergyman (at Beauharnois) took place on Mr.
Killaly's recommendation as a measure of Police and for the preservation
thro' his influence of peace and order on the line of this Canal, not for the
purpose of furnishing religious instruction to the labourers. It having been
deemed inexpedient to Station Troops along the line of the Canal and the
large expense which would have attended the establishment of an effective
Police force, combined to render the course adopted desirable as economic
and effectual for the object designed. If the employment of any person
other than a Roman Catholic Clergyman would have been more likely to
gain the object, such a course would have been taken."

###### H. Clare Pentland’s Labour and Capital in Canada, 1650-1860 is a seminal work that analyzes the shaping of the Canadian working class and the evolution of capitalism in Canada. Written originally as a PhD thesis and long considered an underground classic, the manuscript circulated for many years among students and profes¬ sors of Canadian history and political economy.

 Pentland’s work focuses on the relationship between the availability and nature of labour and the development of industry. From that idea flows an absorbing account that explores patterns of labour, patterns of immigration and the growth of industry. Pentland writes of the massive influx of immigrants to Canada in the 1800s — the taciturn highlanders who eked out a meagre living on subsistence farms; the shrewd lowlanders who formed the basis of an emerging business class; the skilled English artisans who brought their trades and their politics to the new land; the Americans who took to farm¬ ing; and the Irish who came in droves, fleeing the poverty and savagery of an Ireland under the heel of Britain. It was these immi¬ grants, and the burgeoning of a marketplace economy, that launched Canada into industrial capitalism.

 Praised as one of the finest pieces of Canadian economic history ever written, Labour and Capital in Canada, 1650-1860 is an en¬ gaging and endlessly fascinating study — the major work of an author of startling originality often described as an iconoclast who drew on the English Marxist school, the theories of Harold Innis and his own western Canadian background in a remarkable ex¬ ploration of the roots of labour and capitalism in Canada.

 Born in Brandon, Manitoba in 1914, H. Clare Pentland was a professor of economics at the University of Manitoba at the time of his death in 1978. Paul Phillips teaches economics at the University of Manitoba.
