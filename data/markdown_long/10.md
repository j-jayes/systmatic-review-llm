## ABSTRACT

The displacement of jobs via mechanization and automation has long been understood as uncomfortable for labourers but also an intrinsic part of a process of ' creative destruction ' leading to further growth in capitalist economies. This article argues that a seismic shift is currently underway in the dynamics of the labour market with regard to automation. Technologies of automation are capable of a rapidly rising proportion of all of the tasks that capital is willing to pay for and that humans are capable of doing. We highlight the geographically di /uniFB00 erentiated implications of this ongoing transition, and emphasize that geographers are importantly situated to analyse the political and economic implications of what is likely the start of a radical restructuring of the relationships between labouring, resource distribution, and indeed human ethics.

## KEYWORDS

Automation; disemployment; obsolescence of labour; uneven development

Technology has been destroying jobs since the start of the Industrial Revolution, yet new jobs have continually been created. But we have never faced machines that may be able to outcompete us in almost everything! (Vardi 2016)

The misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery of not being exploited at all. (Robinson 1962)

## 1. Introduction

Labour is once again becoming a /uniFB02 ashpoint for political discourse. Recent popular demonstrations and electoral outcomes signal a potent nostalgia for an era of stable employment that can be found from the American Rust Belt to the Zambian Copperbelt (Strangleman 2013; Ferguson 2015). Many have expressed concerns about how processes of globalization, deindustrialization, neoliberalization, and migration are increasing the precarity of employment. In this essay, however, we speci /uniFB01 cally address the relationship between labour and technological transformations, a concern that has thus far been primarily of interest to scholars of technology (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Ford 2015; Kaplan 2015). Despite an established concern with the politics of precarious employment (Waite 2009; Lewis et al. 2015), geographic scholarship has yet to substantively engage with the relationship between labour and ' the robot question ' (although see brie /uniFB02 y Harvey 2014; as well as Del Casino 2016; Bissell and Del Casino 2017 for wider inquiries into robotics and geography). In this article, we aim to establish a research agenda directed toward two crucial, interrelated questions: what is really happening to jobs globally? And, what does that mean for the organization of society?

We occupy a period of considerable change due to the ways in which technology is displacing human labour (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Ford 2015; Kaplan 2015). A recent headline from the Washington Post reports that ' robots could replace nearly a third of the U.S. workforce by 2030 ' (Paquette 2017). Other headlines from the New York Times trumpet that ' robots are winning the race for American jobs ' (Miller 2017) and guide responsible parents in ' how to prepare preschoolers for an automated economy ' (Miller and Bidgood 2017). Speci /uniFB01 c instances of automation-led labour displacement can also be found in the popular media. The emergence of smartphones with digital photo sharing apps such as Instagram displaced the photo development industry; Kodak once employed 145,000 people but declared bankruptcy in 2012, the same year Facebook bought Instagram and its 13-employee operation for $1 billion (The Economist 2016). Similarly, Amazon s ' recent growth is emblematic of the technological transformation of retail work. While the company has received substantial attention for the thousands of jobs that it is creating, the rise of online retailing led more than 89,000 U.S. retail workers to lose their jobs between October 2016 and April 2017, which is more than the total U.S. labour force in the area of coal production (Corkery 2017). While Amazon s retail growth has relied upon major development of its warehousing capacity, it has con-' tinually used automation to increase the productivity of warehouse labour (McPhate 2017), and its expansion has corresponded to huge declines in wages in warehousing (The Economist 2018).

In this article we address the broad dynamics of contemporary automation and identify key political consequences of such transformative shifts, rather than focus on a particular industry or innovation. As journalist David Barnett (2017) asks, ' when we are relieved of the drudgery of work by robots â€¦ how are humans going to a /uniFB00 ord to live? ' Wereview recent literature on precarity in geography, arguing for a need to stretch its focus beyond speci /uniFB01 c employment relationships to consider the general precarity of the need for labour itself. We then examine the way the relationship between labour and technology has been framed in historical and contemporary literature, describing ' technological disemployment ' and, more provocatively, the ' obsolescence of labour . ' Historically, dynamics of technological displacement have been counterbalanced, with technological change creating new job opportunities, decreasing the cost of goods and thereby increasing workers ' buying power, and/or triggering devaluations in the cost of labour that make employing people cost competitive with investments in machines. However, in Section 4, we develop a conceptual argument that disambiguates multiple processes involved in the displacement of labour to speci /uniFB01 cally identify why the contemporary moment is di /uniFB00 erent from what has come before. We follow Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) in arguing that advances in robotics and (especially) computer science will continue to rapidly increase the proportion of tasks of which people are capable that are also within the capacities of automated machines. Speci /uniFB01 cally, societies are approaching an in /uniFB02 ection point beyond which we foresee a rapid increase in the number of task domains in which machines have a competitive advantage over people earning wages.

Weargue this technical transition creates conditions for widespread disemployment: as a result of a continuing erosion of capital s need for waged employees in productive activities, the market econ-' omy will have decreasing demand for the labour of an increasing majority of people. As a result, the global economy is not merely entering a new period of industrial restructuring, with new sectoral and geographical winners and losers (cf Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Kaplan 2015). We draw on and develop themes from scholars such as Kathi Weeks (2011, 2013) and James Ferguson (2015) to propose that we are on the cusp of a new epoch that promises to radically transform the foundational dynamics of labour, requiring a paradigm shift in our conceptual understanding of the relationships between capital, labour, technology and social distribution.

Central to our argument below is that the outcomes of this technological change are far from clear. Although as authors we are, quite frankly, staggered by the potential scope of socio-political change that we believe is likely to be triggered by these shifts, we are deeply unsure about what the future holds. 1 This is, in part, because there is much research to do, but also because we are neither technological nor economic determinists. We /uniFB01 rmly believe there are passive and active social, political and technological choices that will shape our collective future (see Bingham 1996).

<!-- image -->

Indeed, it is precisely because the future is open that we seek to draw attention to trajectories of technological transformation in order to better inform and politicize the choices we make as a society (see Srnicek and Williams 2015; Frase 2016). We argue that research is needed to understand current trends, including their geographical variability, and leverage points for shaping the scale, location and impact of technological disemployment. We also believe that researchers play a key role in understanding and shaping public opinion about what is happening, what this means, what is collectively but not uniformly desired, and how society might achieve such aims (see, for example, Baldwin et al. 2003; Ward 2005).

As geographers, we are speci /uniFB01 cally interested in the geographical implications of technological disemployment, and implications for existing explanatory approaches in geography. In Section 6, we discuss these through a particular focus on areas of our own expertise in urban morphology and uneven developmental geographies. Our intention is to demonstrate how the obsolescence of labour might impact these and, by implication, other areas of scholarly geographic interest. We conclude with thoughts on the contemporary signi /uniFB01 cance for leftist politics, which have since the dawn of the industrial revolution been largely prosecuted through e /uniFB00 orts to forge collective identity based on a shared positionality as exploited labourers.

## 2. From the precarity of labour to its obsolescence

An expanding literature in geography addresses the issue of labour precarity. In Anglo-American scholarship, the question of precarity originated in a growing concern with economic polarization, the disproportionate impacts of the 2008 recession on low-wage workers, and the unevenness of economic recovery. Geographers have highlighted that, in both high and low-skill sectors in the global north, work is shifting from conditions of predictable, lifelong full-time jobs to short term engagements with more variable wages (Coe 2013; Strauss 2017, 2018). While conventional development theory long presumed that the global south would progressively model itself after developed economies, the opposite appears to be occurring: economic conditions in the north increasingly resemble conditions that have long been the southern norm (cf Munck 2013; Siegmann and Schiphorst 2016; see also Comaro /uniFB00 and Comaro /uniFB00 2012). We argue that we need to widen the scope of our analysis of the precarity of labour beyond the employment relationship and interrogate the logical implications of automation for the precarious relationship between labour and the economy as a whole.

Research in labour geographies on precarity often juxtaposes contemporary conditions with an idealized postwar golden age for employment from 1945 -1970 in which white, male workers received relatively high wages from full-time jobs that they were able to hold continuously for the majority of their life (Vosko 2010). Critical scholars describing the geography of labour argue that since the early 1970s, a sustained attack on the labour movement has steadily eroded conditions of employment in the global north (Jessop 1993; Harvey 2007). Scholars have focused on the erosion of the ' standard ' employment relation as the relationship between employer and labourer is re-regulated and reorganized (Peck and Theodore 2001; Vosko 2010). Governing approaches to labour market regulation have shifted from securing full employment to ensuring /uniFB02 exible labour markets in which employers can malleably hire and /uniFB01 re workers in response to demand (Peck and Theodore 2007). Legislative and regulatory changes have weakened employment standards, undermined unions, and reduced access to bene /uniFB01 ts, reliable pensions and unemployment insurance (Coe 2013). The e /uniFB00 ect of these policies has been an increasing polarization of the workforce between highly remunerated professionals and increasingly vulnerable, low-wage workers (Strauss 2018). The rise of precarity is not unique to low-skill work; it is also endemic to work in creative and high-tech industries. Work in computer programming, robotics, and engineering, as well as design, advertising, television, /uniFB01 lm, and music increasingly relies upon intensive project-based contracts. Such work is characterized by a high degree of precariousness and continual circulation within local labour markets (Vinodrai 2006; Hracs and Leslie 2014; Avdikos and Kalogeresis 2017).

4

Scholars have also demonstrated that precarity has long characterized working conditions for the majority of the people in the world. Conversations about such conditions have taken place particularly in scholarship on underemployment and informality (Munck 2013; Siegmann and Schiphorst 2016). In spite of frequent invocations of the value of work and formal waged labour speci /uniFB01 cally (Comaro /uniFB00 and Comaro /uniFB00 2012; Lawhon, Millington, and Stokes In press), lives (and livelihood strategies) have long been marked by uncertainty and /uniFB02 exibility in urban slums, abandoned inner cities, and racialized zones of exclusion across the global north and south (Davis 2006; Wacquant 2008). Research on the experiences of urban youths in particular highlights the speci /uniFB01 c di /uniFB03 culties young people have /uniFB01 nding work, their heavy reliance on informal economic activity, and the extensive periods of waiting that shape their life rhythms (Je /uniFB00 rey 2010; Honwana 2012; Thieme 2018). Global labour geographies, in sum, remind us of how historically and spatially anomalous the golden-age ' standard ' has been: the labour of slaves, sharecroppers, peasants, informal workers, and myriad other labour regimes have long been central to global accumulation strategies.

The dynamics of precarity are often explained with reference to processes of neoliberalization, globalization, deindustrialization, the rise of the service economy, and the growth of the knowledge economy. Yet we are concerned that, while making valuable contributions to our understanding of shifting global dynamics, such scholarship misses a key causal factor that is increasingly shaping not just the conditions of the labour contract, but the fundamental economic need for the labour of people: the automation of work.

Social responses to erosion of the power of labour and the golden-age labour relationship typically fall into two broad categories. The /uniFB01 rst seeks to formalize, standardize, or increase the bargaining power of labour; in general, these e /uniFB00 orts aim to regain the idealized postwar employment relationships of the global north (ILO 2002). The second and more recent response valorizes this instability as an opportunity for individual expression, discursively associating a precarious form of entrepreneurialism with self-actualization and work that is satisfying (Watson 2013; Cockayne 2016). With the normalization of precarity, contingency, and even economic crisis, scholars have argued that individuals are being conditioned to sustain a cruelly misleading optimism, taught to embrace competitive entrepreneurialism as a path of upward mobility, ful /uniFB01 lment, and eventually /uniFB01 nancial rewards and security (Berlant 2011). Widening the scope of the analysis of precarity enables a clearer articulation of the changing relationship between capital, labour, and social distribution. This broader view, we argue, is necessary for enabling a new progressive politics and a wider range of possible social responses, a point we return to in Section 7 below.

## 3. Historical understandings of the relationship between technology and unemployment

While many have attributed the transformations underlying increasing precarity in the north to a series of inter-regional global dynamics, we believe that much of this growing northern precarity is driven by a loss of labour bargaining power as increasingly autonomous machines displace labour and swell the ranks of the underemployed and unemployed. Certainly, this is not a globally uniform shift: as noted above, the postwar Fordist employment relations were geographically, historically, and social atypical (Neilson and Rossiter 2008). Even in the global north, conditions of wage labour were not homogenous. Nonetheless, in this section, we review the history of technological unemployment to highlight the salient di /uniFB00 erences between technological interventions that advance that increase productivity overall and those that maintain productivity but reduce the demand for labour. Doing so, we seek to elucidate the historically unique juncture that our contemporary moment presents.

There is a long tradition of scholars examining the relationship between technology and employment from various political economic traditions (see Woirol 1996 and Bix 2001 for reviews). We situate ourselves with many of these scholars in taking an analytical position that suggests this relationship matters to, but is not deterministic of, wider social relations (see Smith and Marx

1994). As Kliman (1997, 37) notes, ' Contentions that technological advancement reduces employment re-emerge, almost without fail, whenever rapid technological change coincides with rising unemployment. Much contemporary debate is rooted in the repeated recirculation of classical econ-' omic explanations of technological change under capitalism. The earliest version of this argument was developed in the early 1800s as theorists sought to come to terms with workplace mechanization during the Industrial Revolution in Europe. The Great Depression motivated another signi /uniFB01 cant round of scholarly debate, particularly in the United States, where farm workers were being widely replaced by tractors and moving to urban areas. Unemployment in the 1960s again prompted inquiries into this relationship (Woirol 1996; Bix 2001). In each of these eras, analysts have been clear that particular modes of labour were being replaced by machinery, in what Keynes in 1930 labelled ' technological unemployment. '

Classical economic theorists argued that technological substitution of mechanical work for human labour would result in increased productivity (Woirol 1996; Bix 2001). This in turn would contribute to lower prices for produced goods, rising demand, and ultimately, new labour opportunities for displaced workers in an economy that was larger overall. Technological unemployment, then, has been generally treated in the economics literature as an event -a moment in which unemployment occurs -rather than as a condition , or a characteristic of a technological epoch, system, or regime (cf Feldmann 2013). Within this frame, unemployment is seen as a thing that happens to people as individuals: they become unemployed, and thus are returned to the pool of reserve labour. 2 These surplus labourers provide additional labour to meet demand and help create a docile labour force, both reminding the employed of the risk of joblessness and serving as a potential source of labour to replace militant labour organizers (Magdo /uniFB00 and Magdo /uniFB00 2004). The supply of reserve labour serves as a kind of lubricant to ease the friction of arranging a con /uniFB01 guration of labour that can be economically productive. Thus, lower prices as a result of the substitution of machine processes for labour are typically believed to generate:

- (1) increased demand for the lower-priced goods, and thus expansion of production;
- (2) increased demand for other goods, and thus expansion of production; and/or
- (3) higher pro /uniFB01 ts which would be reinvested elsewhere, resulting in expanded production (Woirol 1996).

Empirical analyses have generally supported this argument, although methodological challenges with tracking the interrelationships between automation, prices, demand, pro /uniFB01 ts, and production make such work di /uniFB03 cult (Mokyr, Vickers, and Ziebarth 2015). While some scholars have sought to disambiguate di /uniFB00 erent forces through statistical manipulation (e.g. Dunne and Edwards 2006), spatial analyses are profoundly limited. For example, the Industrial Revolution was accompanied by huge out-migrations of labourers to the colonies, a point largely ignored in part because of the di /uniFB03 culty of measuring such population /uniFB02 ows accurately.

In sum, historical analyses often suggest that the result of the substitution of mechanical energy for human market labour has negative short-term impacts for many individual workers and workertypes, whose speci /uniFB01 c, sometimes hard-acquired work skills are no longer competitively valued in the newly automated labour market. On the whole, however, Euro-American economic approaches have been dominated by the perspective that the impact of technology on employment is generally positive, increasing productivity and creating new employment opportunities. Technological innovation is thus treated as a key element in capitalism s vaunted, characteristic creative destruction (Schump-' eter 1950). This perspective largely underlies the arguments of contemporary scholars of technology who have written popular books on contemporary automation trends: that there is a major technological change ahead, but with appropriate education and training, new employment opportunities will arise (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Ford 2015; Kaplan 2015).

Does this historical pattern explain our present moment? Each time the debate about creative destruction and labour has historically arisen, there have been critics arguing that the particular

<!-- image -->

mode of new technological substitution was di /uniFB00 erent from those that had come before (Moykr et al . 2015). In general, these critics have been proven wrong: in fact, technological substitution for labour generally has increased consumption and has not disrupted macroeconomic levels of employment over the long term in the global north. Yet as Kliman (1997) has reminded us, economic theory regarding technological substitution of labour does not hold that it is inherently or intrinsically true that these displaced labourers will /uniFB01 nd employment elsewhere in the economy .

The most common form of the argument about the relationship between technological substitution and labour takes for granted that technological innovation increases both per-head productivity and the optimally pro /uniFB01 table level of overall output. Under these circumstances, there is an investment-side incentive to expand production and thus maintain or even expand employment within the a /uniFB00 ected /uniFB01 rm or economic sector. For example, early 20th-century technological innovation in steel production radically reduced the labour cost of producing steel in the U.S., thus opening markets for steel at lower prices, stimulating demand and expanding the labour market within the industry as productivity rose and per-unit costs declined (Bix 2001).

However, it is not necessarily true that increasing per-head productivity is accompanied by an increase in the optimally pro /uniFB01 table level of production, either within an individual /uniFB01 rm or within an economic sector. Sometimes, the speci /uniFB01 c nature of a technological increase in labour productivity actually decreases optimal employment for the production of a product. One example is the introduction of the mechanical cotton-picker in the mid-twentieth century, which increased the cotton produced per hour of labour /uniFB01 vefold. During this time in the American South, the total physical potential for cotton production was near-saturated. There was little or no pent-up potential for expanded production of cotton, while the amount of labour required to pick a bale of cotton dropped dramatically (Kliman 1997). Thus, the optimally pro /uniFB01 table number of employees on given /uniFB01 eld went drastically down, while overall cotton industry production held relatively constant. Within the sector of cotton production, employment fell and never recovered.

Conventional macroeconomic theory predicts that if technological innovation that results in displacement ultimately increases productivity and thus total economic e /uniFB03 ciency in the economy as a whole, displaced labourers will /uniFB01 nd employment in other sectors (albeit often incurring individual costs associated with education, retraining, and lost wages) even if the sector they previously laboured within is permanently decimated (as in the case of cotton production above). In such cases, automation would be expected to primarily cause temporary forms of labour precarity, as people need to adjust to technological unemployment and /uniFB01 nd new jobs. However -and this caveat is crucial to our argument as it unfolds below -if the nature of the technological innovation in question changes the value proposition of labouring in general, rather than labour as applied to a particular subset of problems for pro /uniFB01 t-generation, then there could exist a real possibility that a large population of unemployed people might also be unable to /uniFB01 nd work chronically or even permanently, reducing the proportion of the overall population required in order to maximize the extraction of pro /uniFB01 ts from the economic system. We call this the obsolescence of labour.

## 4. Theorizing the rupture: work, labour and technological disemployment

In order to carefully analyze the potential conditions that might give rise to the obsolescence of labour, one needs to de /uniFB01 ne it carefully. What are labour and labouring? Are they merely synonyms for work and working, or are these analytically distinct? Which parts of work can be mechanized or automated, and which parts of labour? Here, we attempt to more precisely trace the nature of work, its relationship with the nature of labour, and how this relationship is relevant to the conversation about (electro-mechanical) automation.

In casual usage, the word ' work is treated as a synonym for the word ' ' labour . In this conventional ' sense, one goes to work and works for a wage. However, our argument here requires analytically distinguishing between work and labour. Work is a process whereby subjects inscribe themselves upon the world, an act of poiesis changing the world (Gorz 1999, 2). Labour is work that occurs under

<!-- image -->

conditions of capital accumulation. Capitalists provide people with wages in exchange for their labour, with the aim of employing that labour to generate pro /uniFB01 ts beyond the cost of wages, /uniFB01 xed costs, etc. Another way of describing this distinction is that labour is work which capital is willing to pay for precisely and exclusively because capital-owners believe that they can pro /uniFB01 tably operationalize such labour to enable accumulation. Drawing this distinction precisely helps us to more carefully describe what is changing for labourers, as the character of automation has changed over time and might evolve in the future.

In the previous section, we articulated a di /uniFB00 erence between individual unemployment (which is transient) and collective sectoral loss of employment as a result of technological change. The conceptual term used in the economics literature to describe a rise in non-employment as a result of technological or political regime change is disemployment , though this phenomenon is less studied that unemployment. Most often used in analyses of low-wage workers, disemployment describes a change that causes some group of people, in the aggregate, to be less employable than before, shrinking the size of the labour market by reducing the aggregate demand for labour, and concomitantly extruding a population that is not able to re-enter the labour market and sell their work elsewhere.

Disemployment is a structural change rather than a short-term dynamic one. It is a rewriting of the rules of labouring such that employment is less possible, whether it be for certain kinds of workers, in particular sectors, or more broadly in the economy overall. Our focus here is on technological disemployment: the degree to and the manner in which automation produces a condition of relatively lower employability in the labour market for speci /uniFB01 c kinds of potential labouring subjects. Their reduced employability, in this case, is driven by technological change and a fundamental modi /uniFB01 cation of the labour regime, or the systemic terms upon which people buy and sell work.

This distinction between unemployment and disemployment helps to clarify why many see technological unemployment as an always-present but essentially transient problem for workers, and an inevitable by-product of all innovation. Technological unemployment is an intrinsic element of economic competition through innovation; as noted above, disemployment in a speci /uniFB01 c sector is usually treated as unemployment under the presumption that these labourers will ultimately /uniFB01 nd employment in another sector. But, as Kliman (1997) emphatically argues, economists have tended to axiomatically assume, rather than demonstrate with data, that technological substitution does not and cannot produce general disemployment Kliman (1997, 45). writes, ' decline in employment that does indeed di /uniFB00 er from ' ordinary ' unemployment will therefore occur if â€¦ potential output fails to grow as fast as average labor productivity. ' That is to say, if individual labourers are more productive because technology allows them to be, but if the nature of the technological innovation is optimally pro /uniFB01 table at a set rather than continuously rising rate of production, then employment will fall.

Conventional economic theory is generally silent regarding conditions under which disemployment could occur across many or most sectors of the economy. If disemployment were widespread, it would mean that the overall level of employment in the economy would decline, while overall production held steady. But why would ' creative destruction, ' a key engine of capitalism s collective cre-' ation through individual dispossession, now suddenly begin to replace labour where previously it instead displaced it?

Crucially, the answer to this question lies not in the total use value which a labourer s work can ' produce, but in the potential exchange value which capital-owners pay labourers to extract on their behalf. We argue that the contemporary mode of technological innovation has three characteristics that have not previously been simultaneously true in the industrial period, but now are (or are about to be):

- (1) Automation increases the productivity of individual labourers in the workforce;
- (2) Automation increases the optimally pro /uniFB01 table level of output less than it increases per-worker productivity; and
- (3) Automation is cost-competitive with human work in a rising majority of tasks of which a typical person is capable.

Since the Industrial Revolution, the /uniFB01 rst of these has usually been true; the second has sometimes been true; the third has never been true. As a result of the combination of these three conditions, we argue, the basic logics of the global economy are changing. As a result, while disemployment as a result of technological change has previously been sectoral, we believe we are seeing the early stages of multi-sectoral, systemic disemployment.

We argue that what is truly new in the current era -and what the validity of this strong claim depends upon -is not the technological substitution of machine work for labour. Nor, precisely or by itself, is the narrowing gap between the scope of tasks which automation can complete and the scope of tasks which typical humans can. It is, instead, the interaction between the widening array of work tasks that are automatable, and a falling cost of automation across the breadth of tasks which undercuts the human labour market. If and when these three conditions are met (labour-saving automation, negative ratio between increasing per-head productivity and optimally pro /uniFB01 table total output, and cost savings of automated work /uniFB02 ows compared to human labour across a majority of the work that humans are capable of doing), then we should logically expect that systemic disemployment will ensue.

For example, the automotive industry is bracing for sectoral technological disemployment in response to self-driving cars. On the production side, both Ford and General Motors expect the advent of self-driving cars to decimate individual car ownership and thus automobile production in the foreseeable future (though both companies hope to be among the companies still standing in the aftermath) (Muoio 2017; Rogers and Lublin 2017). On the service-provision side, Uber has very explicitly stated that it expects the advent of self-driving cars to end the job category of taxi and livery drivers, including those it currently pays (Kang 2017). Because vehicle utilization is expected to rise and the labour inputs to operation are expected to shrink, employment in the vast automotive industry would undoubtedly decline under such conditions.

What we are seeing in the automotive sector is not an end to the potential use value of human labour: people can still make cars that have value (and drive them as well). Instead, this is but one example of a wider context in which the number of domains where human labour is cost-competitive with automation technologies is shrinking because the capacities of electro-mechanical systems are becoming much more systematic. The problem is not that more people couldn t build more ' cars; it s that, like the cotton-pickers of the mid-century American south, it wouldn t be optimally ' ' pro /uniFB01 table to do so. Thus, Ford believes it will weather the hurricane of the advent of self-driving cars pro /uniFB01 tably because while it will sell fewer units, it will widen its pro /uniFB01 t margins by reducing overall employment in the transportation sector by orders of magnitude and owning a piece of the emerging automated transportation services pie, capturing the exchange value those workers previously generated while driving and maintaining vehicles.

The scholarly presumption has long been that these workers would /uniFB01 nd employment in other sectors. But if automation causes disemployment in the majority of economic sectors -precisely because robotized production is generally more pro /uniFB01 table than (useful) work purchased in the labour market -then pro /uniFB01 table production can continue with a declining labour force over time. If labouring in a pro /uniFB01 t-seeking wage market is the only way that societies know how to value the work that citizens do, then the un-ameliorated obsolescence of labour will inexorably produce increasingly widespread poverty among the cohort of workers whose work is useful (in the sense of that other humans would gain from it) but no longer valuable (in the sense of being able to competitively extract exchange value from capital in a waged labour market).

As we have noted above, this phenomenon is exceptionally di /uniFB03 cult to empirically observe through classic methods of case study. This is because the ' absorption ' of labourers who are displaced as a result of sectoral technological disemployment does not entail a move en masse to one other industry: we cannot simply measure the movement of workers in the automotive sector to a new sector. Finding the direct causal relationships between systematically reduced transportation costs and the thousands of job categories which might spring up because of those reduced costs is very di /uniFB03 cult indeed.

Instead, if we are correct and contemporary advances in automation are in the process of obsolescing labour, we propose that one would theoretically expect to see the e /uniFB00 ects of this process in several types of large-scale shifts in the labour market. Below, we describe some of the kinds of shifts we expect in the labour market, and o /uniFB00 er preliminary evidence from recent U.S. and international labour statistics that such a change is, in fact, beginning.

## 5. The future of work: the work that remains

The ' almost ' in this article s ' epigraph -that machines may be able to ' out-compete us in almost everything ' (Vardi 2016) -is important to clarifying the general observation that the character of technological disemployment in the economy is changing. The impact of this increasing use of technology to replace labour is not likely to be evenly distributed within the labour force. We propose that in a context of systemic technological disemployment as a result of automation, at least three key shifts in the structure of the labour market would be expected. Contemporary evidence suggests these are already occurring.

The /uniFB01 rst key shift is a change in the proportions of so-called skilled and unskilled labour (Autor, Levy, and Murnane 2003; Goos and Manning 2007; Chui, Manyika, and Merhemad 2016). Historical examples show that for other major technological shifts, paradigmatic innovations tended to lead to organizational redesign and a shift in the pro /uniFB01 le of the sectoral labour force. Recent technological displacements have served to polarize the skills requirements for employment, favouring skilled ' creative ' workers but retaining a cohort of very low-wage jobs (Frey and Osborne 2013). There remains a category of little-valued but high-contact menial employment which is (relatively) resistant to automation because part of the labour is social-interactional. Thus, we see an increasingly barbell curve in the employment pro /uniFB01 le. Creative and decision-making roles for a relatively small cohort of ' superstars ' (i.e. those with the intellectual capacities, high-end educations, and social networks to manage and contribute to ongoing processes of pro /uniFB01 table innovation) are growing, and we expect the number of these positions to continue to grow in the short-to-medium term (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014). Simultaneously, low-wage employment in ' high-touch ' positions which service these superstars are also expanding, and we expect this trend to continue as well. In between, however, both mid- and high-skill positions which are relatively routine and without substantial individual executive function are being inexorably automated. Routine job tasks have for decades been subject to processes of labour arbitrage in which work is o /uniFB00 shored to low wage locations; however, these tasks are now increasingly subject to robot arbitrage, as tasks are automated rather than simply moved to low wage workers (Peck 2017).

The second expected shift that we see occurring in the labour market is an erosion of job prospects for younger workers in general. The moment of automation implementation -the week when the factory shuts down so that new equipment can be installed -allows a culling of workers, and the workers who retain employment are typically those who have non-rote, non-repetitive skills, who have embodied knowledge of their institutions, and who can be deployed /uniFB02 exibly. The relatively rote, relatively more physically taxing positions are the entry-level positions which tend to be automated /uniFB01 rst. Additionally, mid-career employees have professional social networks which allow them (on average) to more easily /uniFB01 nd other positions, either within their existing organization or in others. As a result, we would theoretically expect erosion of employment prospects for labourers to develop unequally: the e /uniFB00 ects on youth unemployment would be felt /uniFB01 rst as the ' island ' of employment gets smaller and smaller.

Third, we would theoretically expect that automation would enable employers to more easily ' chop up ' the work that is initially most di /uniFB03 cult to automate into increasingly /uniFB02 exibilized or ' gigi /uniFB01 ed contract work. Again, this is what we see happening empirically. The move from highly trained ' professional drivers to Uber contractors picking up extra work on the side (enabled by mapping technologies that reduce expertise) parallels e /uniFB00 orts to o /uniFB04 oad the costs of securing life stability in high-skill areas like programming or design.

<!-- image -->

Any one of these examples of employment loss could be individually dismissed as individual or sectoral. Contra conventional dogma, however, our central contention is that as automation encompasses increasingly complex and higher-order tasks, technological disemployment can proceed -and, in fact, is now proceeding -systematically across multiple sectors, and indeed across the majority of the labour market.

## 6. Spatial implications of widespread technological disemployment

Why should geographers in particular pay attention to the obsolescence of labour? What are geographers particularly well positioned to contribute to research on rising technological disemployment? We believe that the analytical incorporation of technological disemployment as a result of automation into geographical scholarship is likely to require a reshaping of key theorizations and research questions across geography. While one article cannot raise, let alone address, all of these concerns, our intention here is to indicate how the real-world impacts of rising technological disemployment might shape scholarly inquiry. We focus on two sub-disciplinary areas of geography: (1) explanatory theory in urban spatial morphology and urban political economy and (2) explanatory theory in research on globally uneven development, particularly with regard to the global South. We again note the di /uniFB03 culty of using speci /uniFB01 c cases to empirically demonstrate the systematic aspects of the problem, but we do believe that speci /uniFB01 c cases can inform our concepts as well as usefully attend to the consequences, and identify to points of leverage for shaping the impacts of disemployment.

## 6.1. Disemployment and the city

Globally, scholars are increasingly aware that cities do not uniformly re /uniFB02 ect classic northern urban spatial theories of centralized economic activity in a downtown district with surrounding residential clusters. Yet cities are still essential sites of economic agglomeration, and urban /uniFB02 ows (as well as the built infrastructure to support these /uniFB02 ows) remain substantively intertwined with patterns of commuting labourers moving to and from their places of employment (Hanson and Pratt 1988; Steed and Marshall 2001; Giuliano and Narayan 2003). If the thesis we are articulating here plays out as we argue, then we would expect that a decreasing percentage of urban residents will need to (or be allowed to) build their everyday lives around classic commuting behaviours, and this is likely to have profound e /uniFB00 ects on urban morphology. Journalists in the U.S. have already identi /uniFB01 ed contemporary shifts in urban land value as commerce moves from retail space (intermediated by human labouring) to warehouses (increasingly intermediated by automation technologies and the mails) (Thompson 2017; Fung 2018), yet this is likely to be only the beginning of a process of profound change.

One obvious, initial question is: how might a combination of systematic automation and decreasing labour-market participation a /uniFB00 ect processes of densi /uniFB01 cation and de-densi /uniFB01 cation? It is not clear, theoretically, whether labour obsolescence would tend to be centripetal or centrifugal in its net e /uniFB00 ects. On one hand, decreasing labour market participation might reduce participation in production agglomeration, possibly decreasing incentives to live or spend time in high-density urban centres (Madden 1981; Hanson and Pratt 1988; So, Orazem, and Otto 2001). However, if declining labour rates reduce median access to wealth, the ine /uniFB03 ciencies in sprawling urban areas dependent on individualized car transport might create incentives for resettlement into more e /uniFB03 cient urban patterns (Tsai, 2005; Ewing and Rong 2008). Similarly, it is at this point unclear whether increasing transportation automation in the form of self-driving vehicle /uniFB02 eets will, over time, contribute to greater or lesser urban densities. If automated transport tends to reduce levels of individual car ownership and increase dependence on high-density transit modes, this might encourage density (Litman 2000); if it instead tends to increase individual utilization of transit ' pods ' that drive themselves across a less centralized landscape, transit automation might conversely contribute to sprawl.

It is likely that both labour obsolescence generally and transport automation speci /uniFB01 cally will shape urban form in ways that are path-dependent and that vary over time as well as space, making case studies particularly important to our wider understanding. For example, it could be that early transit automation will only be economic at the very high end of the market (individually owned luxury self-driving cars) and the very low end (reducing /uniFB02 eet labour costs by automating high-occupancy mass transit vehicles) (Litman 2017). The rate at which these two use cases converge toward the mass market of current automobiles sold may a /uniFB00 ect the rate at which individuals choose to sell cars and buy into automated transit services (like Uber but without human drivers) vs. choosing to individually own self-driving vehicles. Thus, the actual e /uniFB00 ects on urban morphology could well be dependent not so much on what the technology is capable of, but the relationship between its market costs and (perhaps ironically) the rate at which technological disemployment proceeds, shaping household spending power.

The path we collectively follow will likely re /uniFB02 ect some regionalization and clustering of individual values and policy implementations; individuals ' willingness to give up their private vehicles and states ' willingness to regulate them will not simply be the outcome of rational economic calculations (already, for example, there are di /uniFB00 erences between U.S. American states in how self-driving cars are regulated, shaping the geography of test sites). If individual car ownership declines quickly early on, that might contribute to long-term densi /uniFB01 cation. If prices for transit automation decrease more slowly, that might shape the use of self-driving technology in ways that (at least initially) make it easier for higher-income wage earners to be more indi /uniFB00 erent to commuting distance.

This brief discussion, while explicitly speculative rather than de /uniFB01 nitive, emphasizes that processes of automation and disemployment are likely to have complex, spatially di /uniFB00 erentiated impacts on the practices of urbanism. What is clear is that trends of technological disemployment and automation have the potential to transform essential urban patterns, producing winners and losers across a range of sectors that are hard to predict but which are likely to have substantial cascading impacts. Examples include utilization rates for o /uniFB03 ce space, changing ratios of high-, mid-, and low-income earners, patterns of mobility, spatial patterns of daily rounds for those who are excluded from the wage-earning labour market, new infrastructural patterns, and state policy interventions in the wake of rising disemployment.

## 6.2. Geographically uneven obsolescence of labour

Debates over technological unemployment have largely ignored historical and contemporary economic relations and di /uniFB00 erences between the global North and South. And yet, as geographers have long noted, these global economic relationships matter (Smith 1984) and di /uniFB00 erences between North and South ought to impact the way we theorize them (Robinson 2003). Orthodox economic theories have never su /uniFB03 ciently explained labour and employment dynamics in the global south. In many southern contexts, people have historically and often continue to rely heavily upon a variety of modes of subsistence and informal economic activity for their livelihoods. Further, unemployment has, in recent decades, often remained stubbornly high in ways that largely defy orthodox theorization (despite extensive policy intervention) (e.g. Cooper 1996; Bhorat, Cassim, and Hirsch 2014; Lawhon, Millington, and Stokes In press).

We suggest that the analytic of labour obsolescence may help to explain many contemporary socio-economic quandaries better than conventional development theory, which has struggled to identify the roots of endemic and enduring underemployment. Despite widespread critique of the teleology of development theory, policy interventions in the global south are still largely based on the idea of following the global north: growing the economy and improving education remain foundational. And yet, as farms and mines mechanize today , manufacturing is not /uniFB01 lling the gap in employment in the way that it did hundreds of years ago in Europe, 40 years ago in Southeast Asia and 20 years ago in mainland China. Anthropologists such as Li and Ferguson have written about ' surplus peoples ' caused by the displacement of farm labour and reduced viability of resource

<!-- image -->

economies, but we are left without explanation as to why such peoples are surplus when conventional economic theory suggests they will be reabsorbed into the labour market for other tasks (Li 2014; Ferguson 2015; Ferguson and Li 2018; see also Bhorat, Cassim, and Hirsch 2014).

We argue that there is a largely unexamined in /uniFB02 uence that explains a fundamental inability (according to the logic of capital to seek the lowest cost inputs) of capital to absorb this labour surplus (rather than, for example, a need for education or more growth). In other words, it does not matter how much southern economies grow or how well trained their participants become, widespread formal employment is unlikely. In places like South Africa, we can already see that even though economic output continues to increase, employment is falling (Stats SA 2014); in places like China and Brazil, high youth unemployment is indicative of the inability of the economy to absorb new labourers (Miles 2015). This is at least in part because of productivity gains do not increase the optimal levels of labour utilization to maximize pro /uniFB01 table employment, a phenomenon described as job-' shedding growth . The low-skill, low-wage employment opportunities that disproportionately con-' stitute economic opportunities in southern countries are precisely those we would expect to be most vulnerable to automation. This vulnerability is exacerbated in locales where there is comparatively little local money to pay for service economy jobs when production employment is disrupted. Under these circumstances, we argue that a deeper engagement with southern economies through the analytical lens of labour obsolescence might well indicate that this phenomenon is already widespread.

A second point of inquiry we suggest for geographers of uneven development is to examine the globally di /uniFB00 erentiated impacts of labour obsolescence. A new global division of labour will, in some ways, create opportunities for lucky superstars (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014): most of these are likely be in locales with speci /uniFB01 c high-quality educational opportunities and networks of relation with existing high-tech expertise (see Richardson and Bissell In press for a geographically complex articulation of the location of digital skills). Residents of Lagos and Johannesburg may /uniFB01 nd occasional moments of such opportunity and connection in the transition to automation; Kinshasa and Harare likely will not. One might imagine that many forms of work already inadequately valued in capitalist economies might well continue as they long have, such as informal trading and domestic work. And yet the well-documented linkages between formal and informal economies make it di /uniFB03 cult to imagine that global changes in formal-sector labour demand will not be widely impactful.

The south as a whole will surely not prove entirely peripheral: while many have lauded the digital economy s ethereal qualities, geographers and others have insisted that we also attend to the very ' material requirements for the production of machines. The global south will likely continue to be a source of material resources, and might well continue its role in the production and destruction of objects. Ownership rights and the returns to communities are already highly politicized issues, and will likely become even more so as the labour requirements for resource extraction diminish. Competition with mechanized agriculture is already making it di /uniFB03 cult for southern residents to maintain their hold on land, and land for crop production is increasingly coming under the control of global capital (e.g. Li 2014). Reduced demand for labour will likely only increase such trends. Thus, on the whole, it is reasonable to anticipate that labour obsolescence would enable capital to materially extract more from southern locations while requiring even fewer workers; such captures would likely limit the ability of southern residents to develop alternative livelihoods even through informal sector work.

Importantly, we reiterate that our speculations here are not means to be speci /uniFB01 cally predictive of what the future will hold. Our key analytical concern is that existing discussions of future patterns of urbanism and uneven development in the geographical literature seem not to account for present and future possible impacts of technological disemployment and labour obsolescence. Yet these present profound spatial impacts that could profoundly challenge the spatial theories geographers have long deployed. Our speculative discussions of urbanism and uneven development are meant to illustrate the scope of the potential impact of technological disemployment on geography, and the need for careful research into its potential geographical impacts. Following Frase (2016), we present our

' speculative non /uniFB01 ction ' to incite our collective political imagination. The technological future remains undetermined and we are motivated by a desire to politicize conversations about technology and engage a broader discourse about its future. Learning from geographically variegated accounts can help scholars to better understand how to intervene and shape the trajectory of technological development.

## 7. The politics of globally uneven technological disemployment

Up to this point, we have built our discussion primarily upon the conceptual architecture of scholars in technical sciences, economics, and the history of technology to suggest that seismic changes are likely at hand in terms of the ability of machines to perform tasks typically undertaken as human labour. Our conceptual argument suggests that these fundamental changes are unlikely to be usefully addressed by, for example, greater investments in education and training (cf Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Kaplan 2015). Education might, undoubtedly, increase the likelihood of speci /uniFB01 c individuals to obtain work in a new economy. But our global geographical lens insists that the reasonably optimistic conclusions of much technical and economic literature ignore the realities of the global majority who will be peripheral to the needs of an economy dominated by machines.

For the conventionally understood left, this raises an existential question: of what interest to capital is labour solidarity if labouring is not dear to those who own the means of production? This is no minor detail: it goes to the heart of the real leverage which humans have when attempting to sell their work for wages in the labour market and has for decades troubled leftist politics in the global south. Our intention here is, surely, not to minimize the e /uniFB00 orts of centuries of labour organizing toward more egalitarian visions. But our central contention here is that political contestations need to grapple not primarily with the exploitation of labour but rather the division between those with access to employment and those without. The increased and likely increasing numbers of unemployed, underemployed, and informally employed people require that we develop political and economic subjectivities beyond those of labouring bodies and towards a decoupling of the allocation of material resources from the moral valorization of labouring (see Ferguson 2015; Li 2017; Ferguson and Li 2018; Lawhon, Millington, and Stokes In press).

We believe that addressing this moment requires reorienting our scholarship away from the question of jobs and toward the politics of joblessness, and speci /uniFB01 cally, how distribute the outputs of our economy if and when the labour of many is economically obsolete. The decoupling of human labour from production -however chaotic -might serve as impetus to form a new kind of politics of distribution that could, ultimately, produce better, more just futures. Inspired by scholars such as Weeks (2011), Ferguson (2015), and Srnicek and Williams (2015), we hail new analyses that interrogate the politics of distribution in a world of su /uniFB03 cient resources but without simultaneous demand for the productive labour of all.

One particular area which we believe has political potential involves recent arguments for universal (or, for some, unconditional) basic income (UBI). Such incomes are a regular cash income paid to all, on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement. Arguments for UBI can be traced at least to the eighteenth century (Van Parijs and Vanderborght 2017). While in many contexts, particularly in the global south, cash transfers are framed as instigating access to and participation in in labour markets and forms of entrepreneurial activity (Ballard 2013), our analysis of the emerging phenomenon of labour obsolescence gives the conversation new importance. Calls for basic incomes have even come from the heart of technological innovation (Cli /uniFB00 ord 2017; Lui 2017; see also conversations around the World Economic Forum, Santens 2017). This indicates not only that those on the forefront of technological change are concerned about the implications of technology on labour, but that they recognize a need for interventions to bolster the consumer power of those who will be out of work. Undoubtedly, granting governments so much economic in /uniFB02 uence is likely to give many pause, but UBI appears increasingly to be gaining political traction in light of the impacts of automation.

<!-- image -->

Geographical questions of boundaries and scale are essential to questions of basic income distribution (Arnold 2018). Silicon Valley is likely to retain a taxable economic base to fund the distribution of basic incomes, and places like Johannesburg might well retain a foothold in a new economy that enables some level of taxable economic activity. But it is far from evident that the majority of the global population will have a municipal or national-scale government with a su /uniFB03 cient economic activity (and thus the tax base, political will, legitimacy, and capacity) to redistribute the productive output of the new economy. Further, it is increasingly clear that machines will not just replace productive labour but will also enhance the coercive power of actors such as, but not limited to, nation-states (Allen and Husain 2017; Simonite 2017; Straub 2018).

We again strongly state that such futuristic imaginings are far beyond anyone s ability to concre-' tely predict. Our emphasis in this section is that a globally just outcome of an ' end of labour ' thesis is far from inevitable: it will be the product of social, political, and possibly physical contestation. This article is, surely, motivated by our interest in the analytical rigour needed to understand our world. But we are even more motivated by a pressing urge to draw attention to the possible political futures at many scales and in many locations, and the agonistic debates and social mobilization required to enact globally just possibilities. We emphatically do not believe there is utility in trying to predict a priori which future will come to pass. Instead, we call for scholarly attention and activism toward bending this future in the direction of maximal justice.

## 8. Conclusion

In this article, we have argued that a careful consideration of contemporary technology-led innovation -particularly with regard to robotics and machine learning -suggests that the historic tendency for innovation to grow both whole-economy employment and the absolute scale of material production is contingent and changeable, rather than intrinsic to the chaotic creativity of capitalist development per se . Scholars with the deepest understanding of current innovations in robotics and automation have been most prone to argue that the contemporary technological moment is di /uniFB00 erent in character than those that have come before (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Kaplan 2015). And yet, while we agree with their technological analysis, as social scientists we are deeply concerned with the limited social analysis and political advice that has followed.

We seek to end our article on a cautiously hopeful note: we believe that automation maintains the possibility for humans to spend less time undertaking tedious, alienating labour. New modes of redistribution could well enable people to spend more time exploring their creativity, dwelling in emotional relationships, and more generally enhancing human potential. And yet, we are very clear that this future is far from inevitable: it can only realistically be considered as a possible outcome of agonistic (and likely agonising) political claims-making. Speci /uniFB01 cally, such a politics would need to prevent the imminent capture of the material economy and its outputs by a cohort of elite owners and labourers and insisting instead on some model of shared distribution (cf Ferguson 2015). Doing so would require the valorization of a very di /uniFB00 erent ethical framework than the ones that are currently hegemonic through which to exert claims on capital and the state for the distribution of material resources (Neilson and Rossiter 2005; Fineman 2008).

We believe that geographers have much to o /uniFB00 er in terms of taking forward a research agenda on technological disemployment, particularly in terms of its implications for uneven development. Further, we argue that disemployment will signi /uniFB01 cantly impact many theoretical debates and empirical concerns that geographers have long identi /uniFB01 ed as core areas of interest, including economies, labour, cities, and global development. For these reasons, we believe it is crucial for geographers to speak into these nascent but rapidly widening debates as well as to attend to these phenomena in geographical studies.

## Notes

- 1. In what follows, we develop a logical argument about the relationship between technology and labour and speculate about what it might means for a possible future. We are very mindful of the limitations of prediction (and the many errors that have occurred when scholars tried to do so, particularly around issues such as resources (e.g. Meadows et al. 1972)!). Our argument here is not intended to foreclose other possible futures: at the very least, climate change, energy limitations and/or large-scale warfare might well overshadow the impact of technological displacement.
- 2. Keynes (1932) notably argued that increased use of technology would lead to the meeting of our material wants and a signi /uniFB01 cant increase in leisure rather than a reabsorption of the available labour. Unemployment in earlier periods of major technological change was accompanied by decreases in the number of hours in the working day (Srnicek and Williams 2015). However, the kind of systematic reduction of labour hours and meeting of material satisfaction described by Keynes have not come to pass (Woirol 1996; Bix 2001). This example is a useful reminder that the social implications of technological disemployment cannot be determined through logical calculations about economic relations, but are profoundly shaped by social, cultural and political in /uniFB02 uences.
