CHAPTER TWENIY-FIVE

##### The Industrial Revolution In England

In the England [and Scotland!—Ed]* of Adam Smith industrial
capitalism was still in its early stages Agriculture held first place,
while handicraft and cottage industry continued to prevail within
industry Industrial capitalism could begin its victorious progress only
after the factory, with its extensive application of machinery and steam
engines, had supplanted the manual labour of the -manufactory. This
transition from manufactory to factory took place during England's
_industrial revolution; embracing the latter quarter of the 18th century_
and the first quarter of the nineteenth This is precisely the lapse of
time that separates Ricardo's activity from that of Smith. If we can call
Smith the economist of the manufactory period, Ricardo's writings
arose against the background of rapidly developing factory, machine
production.

The beginning of the industrial revolution is usually set at 1769, the
jumping off point for a rapid succession of inventions which com­
pletely transformed production technology It would be a great
mistake, however, to see the industrial revolution as the result of the
accidental appearance of fortuitous inventions Machines to replace
human labour had been invented before But during the guild period,
when the crafts were working for1 a restricted local market, such

machinery was unnecessary, and could only spell ruin to the handi­
crafts It is therefore understandable that the guilds used every means
they could to oppose theit introduction, secure their prohibition,
destroy the piototypes made by audacious inventors, and have the

latter banished from a town or put to death Thus the use of the
ribbon loom was banned in the 16th century, that of a machine for
manufacturing needles at the beginning of the 17th century, and so
on.

During the 17th and 18th centuries—the epoch of the decline of
the guilds, the strengthening of merchant capital, the growth of mass
(cottage industry) production for export, and the birth of the manu­
_factories—situation_ altered An immediate objective for entre­
preneurs was now to lower production costs. The urge to make
technological improvements and economies in costs of production
gave rise during the 17th century to a feverish pursuit of inventions
The innovations of the 17th century—the extensive use of any and
every type of water mill, technical innovations in mining and metal­
lurgy (the use of machines to pump water out of mines, the
construction of blast furnaces), improved methods of transmitting
power (cog-wheels arid fly-wheels, transmissions)—all prepared the
way for the enthusiastic acceptance of the machine within industry
Yet prior to the middle of the 18th century these different inventions
were incapable of revolutionizing an industry which remained depen­
dent upon power sources (man, animals, and water) that were either
weak or could be driven by machine power only in specific localities

The stimulus for the industrial revolution at the close of the 18th
century came, as we know, from inventions 1) in the cotton textile
industry, 2) in metallurgy, and 3) the invention of the steam engine
Each of these was merely the end result of a long line of preceding
inventions, the outcome of quests that had extended over decades .

It was no accident that this rapid succession of inventions took place
in the youngest branch of England's textile industry, cotton textiles-
Making its appearance in England only late (in the 17th century) it
had not been subjected to guild regulations Cotton textiles could only
win out in its intense struggle with the older woollen industry by
relying on new technical improvements In the middle of the 18th
century looms wete both improved and made bigger in size But as
the spindles used in spinning continued to retain their medieval
construction, spinners were unable to provide the weavers with
enough thread This thread 'famine' compelled inventors to start
looking for new methods of spinning In 1769 Arkwright took out a
patent on his 'water' machine, an improved version of the spinning
_machine that he had invented in the 1730's. Within a year Hargreaves_
had taken out a patent on his spinning 'Jenny' Finally, in 1779.
Crompton combined the achievements of these two inventions into his

'mule', which began rapidly to drive out hand spinning A spinnet
using this machine could prepare 200 times as much thread as he
could^without it Now it was the weavers who could no longer keep up
with all the thread supplied by the spinners: there was an urgent need
for an improvement in weaving methods In 1785 Cartwright invented
the mechanical loom, but it was not used extensively until further
improvements had been made to it From 1813 onwards it began to
drive out hand weaving

Gradually the spinning and weaving machines spread into the wool
industry as well

A second field of technical inventions was metallurgy. Up until the
middle of the 18th century both iron and cast iron had been produced
using wood fuel Blast furnaces were set up near forests, moving to
new sites when the supply of wood became exhausted By the 17th
century England was already beginning to record a shortage of forests.
At the start of the 18th century the scarcity and rising price of wood
fuel caused metallurgy to pass through a severe crisis and recession. It
was essential to find new forms of fuel Such fuel existed in the form of
hard coal, but prior to the mid-18th century the numerous attempts
that had been made to coke coal and use it in the processing of iron
had all met with no result. Only after the mid-18th century was pig
iron extensively produced using mineral fuel (Derby's method,
invented in 1735); beginning in the 1780's, rolled iron started to be
produced using hard coal, thanks to the new method of 'puddling'
invented by Cort in 1780 The combination of iron and coal that was
to be so important for capitalism had now taken place [1]

Finally there was the most important and universal invention of this
period: in 1769 James Watt built his famous steam machine, a pump
for removing water from mines The artificial removal of water from
mines had begun as early as the 16th century In 1698 Severi had
invented for this purpose the first steam engine which, in the
improved version given it by Newcomen in the early 18th century, had
become widely used in mining However, Newcomen's machine could
not cope with very deep shafts or a strong head of water Watt's new
invention eliminated this defect. His initial machine was intended
only for the extraction of mine water. In 1781, however, after
additional improvements, Watt converted his machine from a pump
into a universal steam engine applicable to all branches of industry
Following its initial introduction into textile and metallurgical produc­
tion, the steam engine seized one branch of industry after another At
the start of the 19th century the steam engine was applied tp

Ihe inventions just described could not have exerted the swift and
revolutionary impact they did had there not existed the socio­
_economic conditions necessary for the extensive development of_
factory industry By the end of the 18th century these conditions were
already present in England. On the one hand, the epoch of com­
mercial capital had already seen a significant accumulation of capital
in the hands of traders, financiers, industrialists, etc.; the new factory,
industry presented these free capitals with a wide-open field for
investment On the other hand, landless peasants, ruined craftsmen
and cottage labourers, and paupers of various sorts provided in abun­
dance the human material'that capital could employ foi its own needs
The ancient guild restrictions that had stood in the way of capitalist
development had already fallen into decay by the end of the 18th
century In the 1780's Tucker could say 'the privileges of the guilds
and the trading corporations in the towns have at the present moment
only insignificant power and are incapable of causing a great deal of
harm, as was formerly the case.'[2]

Under these conditions factory industry grew at an extraordinarily:
rapid rate In the words of one contemporary, 'a new race of factory-
owners rushed to set up factories wherever the opportunity presented
itself; they began to fix up old barns and sheds, punched windows m
bare walls, and transformed these premises into weaving workshops '
'Any who had capital, however small it might be, threw it into a
business: shop keepers, inn keepers, goods ferrymen, all became
factory owners Many of them met with failure, but others attained,
their objectives and acquired fortunes..'[.3] The period from 1788 to
1803 was called the 'golden age' of cotton textiles, with productron
increasing three-fold during that time This type of rapid growth in
production was made possible only by the introduction of machinery
which cut production costs and caused the price of cotton cloth to fall-
considerably The introduction of the spinning machine brought
down the production costs of thread from twelve shillings to three,
shillings in 1800, and even to 1 shilling in 1830 With the fall in the
costs of production came a cheapening of commodities: the price of a
pound of thread fell from thirty-five shillings to nine shillings in 1800,
and to three shillings in 1830 Production costs and prices on many
industrial commodities fell between ten and twelve times Cheap
cotton cloth began to displace more expensive woollens; thanks to
their cheapness they managed to force their way into the remote-

countryside and onto foreign markets In the 17th and 18th centuries
the fate of England's economy had depended primarily on its wool
industry; from the beginning of the 19th century onwards, it was the
cotton industry that played this role.

The feverishly quick advance of factory production brought pro­
found changes to the English economy It was only now that the centre
of gravity shifted from agriculture to industry On the eve of the
industrial revolution (1770) England's population was divided about
equally between town and country; a half century later (1821)
agriculture employed only 33% of the population A flight from the
countryside had begun: the population of the factory towns grew with
incredible speed. Between 1760 and 1816 the population of Man­
chester increased from 40,000 to 140,000; that of Birmingham from
30,000 to 90,000; that of Liverpool from 35,000 to 120,000 England
was on the way to becoming 'the workshop of the world,' providing
factory-made goods for the rest of the world. Its foreign trade grew
rapidly Between 1760 and 1815 imports into England went from ten
million to thirty million pounds sterling, its exports from fifteen
million to fifty-nine million Having previously had the export
industry subordinate to it, the export trade now itself became
subsidiary to a powerfully developed industry The leading role
gradually passed from commercial to industrial capital

The industrial revolution opened up vast prospects for a great
forward surge of England's productivity of labour and national
wealth. Yet even in these first stages of its development, indus­
trial capitalism revealed with utmost clarity its negative, as well
as its positive aspects The colossal rise in the nation's production did
not reduce the poverty of its masses in the least Machinery which was
intended to save on human labour frequently gave a further push to
the deterioration in the labourers' working conditions Introduced at a
feverish pace, it displaced hand spinners, weavers and other workers,
who were threatened with either death by starvation or an existence as
paupers. Understandably, the workers looked upon the machine as the
most evil of their enemies. 'The machine' wrote one worker, 'has left
us in rags and without a living, the machine has driven us into a
dungeon, locked us up in a prison worse than the Bastille I look upon
any improvement which tries to reduce the demand for human labour
as the most dreadful curse that can fall on the head of the working
class, and I consider it my obligation to oppose the introduction of
machinery, this scourge, into any branch of industry whatsoever.'[4]
This passionate protest expressed a feeling widely held by the working

masses The introduction of machines often provoked workers' riots-
they burned down factory buildings, smashed the machinery, and
tried to have it proscribed These spontaneous movements, however/
were powerless to halt the process of bringing in machinery

The machine meant the utter ruin of hand spinners and weavers,
put an end to the cottage industries that had provided the peasant
family with a second means of income, and made adult workers-
compete for work by drawing women and children into the factory
Although it is true that female labour had also been used in cottage
industries, the woman had previously been working at home on her
own, whereas now her departure for the factory meant leaving the
children unattended unless they, too, came along, Engels, in his
famous book, The Condition of the Working Class in England,
painted a shocking picture of the conditions under which workers
laboured in the final period of the industrial revolution (the 1830's
and 1840's): five year old children working in factories, women and
children performing heavy labour down the pits, children of seven
spending twenty hours a day underground Parish orphanages used to
hand over whole flocks of children to factory owners, ostensibly for
'training', but in reality for forced labour. The factory owners would
pass them from one to another like slaves.

Conditions were no less difficult for adult workers Factory legisla­
tion was as yet non-existant; the law placed no restrictions on the
exploitation of labour, while workers' trade unions were banned and
subject to government prosecution The working day averaged 13 to
14 hours, but was often even longer. The lack of hygiene in the
factories was horrific As for wages, in monetary terms these on the
whole rose throughout the second half of the 18th century,* but in
_real terms they fell due to the sharp rise in the price of corn and other_
means of subsistence (meat, butter, etc ) According to Barton, in
1790 the weekly wages of a skilled worker would buy 169 pints of corn,
in 1800 only 83

The sharp fall in teal wages is accounted for by the swift rise in the
prices of grain and other agricultural produce which began in the last
decade of the 18th century and ended in 1815, with the conclusion of
the Napoleonic war In the 1770's, when the industrial revolution
began, the average price of corn stood at about forty-five shillings per
quarter In the 1790's it was fifty-six shillings, rose to eighty-two
shillings during the first decade of the 19th century, and to 106

shillings in the period 1810-1813. That coin prices rose so rapidly is
explained first by the growth of England's urban industrial popula­
tion, which heightened the demand for corn, and second, by the short­
fall in the supply of corn coming from agrarian countries (e g , Prussia
and Poland) during the war with Napoleon It was not simply the war
and Napoleon's declaration of the continental blockade that slowed
down the flow of cheap corn into England: the English government,
acting in the interests of the landlords, did all it could to hinder the
import of foreign grain through the imposition of high customs
_duties By a law of 1791, the import of foreign grain into England_
became possible only if the latter's price on the domestic market was
raised to fifty-five shillings per quarter In 1804 this base price was
raised—in the interests of the landowners—to sixty-four shillings, and
in 1815 to eighty-two shillings The combined effect of a number of
factors (the country's rapid industrialization, the war with France,
harvest failures, and agricultural protectionism) acted to produce a
colossal rise in grain prices over the period 1790-1815

At the sight of such a vertiginous increase in corn prices, farmers
and landowners rushed to utilize every spare plot of land The
enclosure' of common lands took on vast proportions. Large capitalist
farms increasingly displaced peasant holdings Poor lands, waste
lands, bogs—all of which were deemed unprofitable when com prices
were lower—now began to be cultivated. The drawing of inferior lands
into production, the associated increase in the cost of producing corn,
and the rise in grain prices were all features of English agriculture at
the start of the 19th century and all found their precise reflection in
Ricardo's theory of rent

A second consequence of the advance in coin prices was a rapid rise
in the ground rentrthat-farmers.paid.to the landlords From the 1770's
up until the end of the war with France"'rental""payments rose on
average by 100% to 200%, and not infrequently by four or five times
In Scotland the total amount of ground rent in 1795 was £2,000,000;
in 1825 it was £5,250,000 A farm in Essex which had been leased in
1793 at ten shillings an acre rented in 1812 [51 foi fifty The war, high
prices, and bad harvests had made the landlords stupendously rich

**Their brethren out to battle—why? for rent!(6]**

aristocracy he was expressing the sentiments of the most diverse
sections of the population

Indeed, dissatisfaction with high corn prices and with protective
legislation on behalf of the gentry had spread throughout the country
The industrial bourgeoisie assumed the leadership of the movement
against the corn laws Industrialists remarked with dismay that the
lion's share of the profits brought by England's industrialization were
slipping right through their own hands into those of the land
magnates The industrialists' dream was to shower the entire world
with cheap goods from their own factories; but for this cheap hands
were necessary The high price of corn made it impossible to lower
money wages Further, high corn prices undermined the purchasing
_power of the workers and urban petty bourgeoisie, thus reducing the_
domestic market for industrial products Periods of poor harvests and
high grain prices often coincided with severe trade and industrial
crises

The broad mass of workers suffered not simply from expensive corn,
but also from the introduction of machinery, unemployment, and low
wages. The early ideologists of the proletariat had already grasped that
the root of these evils lay not in the corn laws, but in the capitalist
system. Yet the propaganda of the first Utopian socialists (Owen for
example) affected but a narrow circle The broad mass of workers still
lent a sympathetic ear to the agitation against the corn laws The first
decades of 19th-century England were passed in an atmosphere of
bitter struggle between the landowning class and the commercial and
industrial bourgeoisie supported by the broad mass of workers and
petty bourgeois In 1815 the agrarians still held the upper hand, and
the protective tariffs on corn were increased In 1820 the London
merchants presented their famous petition to Parliament, in which
they demanded the introduction of free trade as the only means by
which the products of England's factories could gain broad access to
the world's markets In 1822 the merchants of Manchester put the
same demand in their own memorandum. Manchester, the centre of
cotton textile production, had become the fortress of the partisans of
free trade, who hence became known as the 'Manchester' school. With
the industrial crisis at the end of the 18.30's the struggle for free trade
took on greater dimensions. The Manchester chamber of commerce
presented a petition to Parliament in which it explained that 'without
the immediate repeal of the corn duties the ruin of factory industry

[would be] inevitable, and that only the broad application of the
principle of free trade [could] assure the future prosperity of industry
and the peace of the country '[7] The anti-Corn Law League, founded
by Cobden and Bright, enlisted hundreds of thousands of supporters

and conducted a powerful agitation ovet the entite countiy In 1846
the long decades of struggle finally ended in victory for the bour-
'geoisie: the corn laws were repealed, and England went definitively
over to a system of free trade

The bourgeoisie secured its victory only in the period following
Ricardo's death, .although the historic debate between the commer­
cial-industrial bourgeoisie and the landlord class was already well
alight during his lifetime All Ricardo's literary activity took place in
this atmosphere of struggle between social classes The fundamental
socio-economic phenomena of his day—the rapid growth of industry
and the successes of machine production, the menacing rise in corn
prices and ground rent, and the bourgeoisie's dissatisfaction with the
corn laws—left a deep imprint on the whole of his theoretical system.

a[ economic policy Ricardo stood as a leader of the industrial^ ]
ourgeoisie: he demanded that the corn duties be repealed and free
:ade introduced His theoretical system, for all its abstractness and/
pparent separation from the real economic conditions of his day, was

## Sin fact closely tied to them. Its two central components—the theory of

value and the theory of distribution—both reflect the economic
conditions of early 19th-century England In his labour theory of value
Ricardo summed up the many and varied factors which caused
technical improvements and increases in labour productivity to lowei
the price of factory products The extensive application of machinery
had compelled Ricardo to ponder on the extent to which the use of
machines (fixed capital) might modify the law of labour value The
raging struggle between the bourgeoisie and landowners and the more
distantly perceptible battle between bourgeoisie and proletariat con­
centrated Ricardo's thoughts on to the theory of disribution Ricardo
made the impetuous rise in corn prices and ground rent the basis of his
_theory of rent. 'The grievous distress of the workers, notwithstanding_
rising nominal wages, found theoretical reflection in the Ricatdian
_theory of wages The struggle between the landowners and the_
bourgeoisie caused Ricardo to think in terms of an irreconcilable
_conflict of interests between these two classes: the idleness of the aristo­_
cracy and the rise in corn prices that were typical features of a capitalist
economy were foi him the main reason for the fall in profits and the
primary threat to capital accumulation and the ability of the capitalist
economy to grow [8] Ricardo owes to his epoch both the strong and
weak points of his theoretical system. Insofar as the English economy at
the start of the 19th century had already managed to develop those
features that are typical of a capitalist economy, Ricaido succeeded in

permanently into economic science Wherever he took transient or

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

##### Ricardo's Life

David Ricardo (1772-1823) was born in London into the family of a
wealthy Jewish banker By the age of fourteen Ricardo was assisting his
father in his stock exchange operations, but a few years later he broke
with his family when he was converted to Christianity [1] He became
an independent jobber on the stock exchange, where, thanks to his
remarkable ability to foresee the price movements on securities, he
amassed a huge fortune in just a few years At the age of twenty-five
Ricardo was already enjoying a reputation in London as a millionaire
and famous banker

Apparently, however, playing the market soon ceased to afford
Ricardo any satisfaction: his spirit harboured a passionate thirst for
knowledge. At twenty-five he abruptly altered his style of life, gave up
speculating on the exchanges, purchased an estate, and devoted his
time to self-education At first he studied mathematics and natural
science, set up his own laboratory and collected minerals Two years
later he was so impressed by Smith's book as to give himself wholly
over to the study of economic questions, which could get quite a grip
on the mind of a man familiar with the secrets of stock-jobbing

At the beginning of the 19th century economic questions had once
again become the subject of animated discussion in England. The
long war with Fiance had thrown English economic life into profound
disarray. This disorder showed up particularly in the depreciation of
England's currency (the bank notes issued by the Bank of England,
whose convertibility into gold had been suspended during the war)
and in the exorbitant rise in the price of com. These were practical
questions, which touched the vital interests of different social groups,
and gave rise to tremendous discord Nor was this an academic debate
among students in the quiet of some study; it was accompanied by
bitter polemics in Parliament and the press Such a fierce conflict of
opinions and interests prompted the modest Ricardo, who had little
confidence in his own abilities, to embark upon a literary career. In
1809, some ten years after he had set about his study of economic
matters, he published some articles and a pamphlet, On the High
_Price of Bullion, in which he gave an outline of his quantity theory of_


-----

232 _David Ricardo_

_money [2] He explained the depreciation of the bank notes by their_
excessive emission and demanded that a certain portion of them be
withdrawn from circulation if the currency was to be brought back to
health

In the years that followed Ricardo issued a number of short
polemical works also dedicated to questions of monetary circulation;
In 1815 he published An Essay on the Influence of alow Price of Corn
_on the Profits of Stock In this work Ricardo was already acting as a_
defender of industrial capitalism and had come to the conclusion that
the interests of the landowning class conflicted with those of the other
classes of society At this time, as a letter of 1815 makes clear, Ricardo
had no ambition to publish a work embracing the fundamental
theoretical questions of economics 'Thus you see', he wrote, 'that I
have no other encouragement to pursue the study of Political Economy
than the pleasure which the study itself affords me, for never shall Ibe
so fortunate however correct my opinions may become as to produce a
work which shall procure me fame and distinction '[3] However, just
two years later, in 1817, influenced by the persistent advice of his
friend, James Mill, Ricardo published the book that was to earn him
immortal fame, his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation-.
Although most of the chapters in the book are devoted to discussions
of practical questions, mainly taxation, the few theoretical chapters
guaranteed Ricardo permanent fame as one of the great economists.:
His book marks the highest point that the Classical school was able to
attain—after that it went through only agony and a period of decay-

Although Ricardo himself at one time said that no more than
twenty-five men in the whole of England had understood his book, it
nevertheless earned him tremendous fame among his contemporaries
and made of its author the head of an entire school Ricardo stood at
the centre of the vital economic discussions of his day He was in
constant personal contact or in correspondence with all the outstand­
ing economists of his day. Some of them became his closest disciples
and followers (James Mill, McCuIloch), the first apostles of the.
orthodox 'Ricardian' school Yet even those of his opponents who
created their own economic systems (Malthus, Say, Sismondi) could
not fail to defer to his great intellect and scientific candour Malthus,:
who was his constant opponent and a fierce defender of the landown­
ing class, called the day Ricardo died the unhappiest day of his life

Ricardo loved to hold domestic gatherings of friends and famous
economists for uninhibited chats and discussions about topical econ?.r
omic subjects These meetings of friends formed the basis of the;

_Ricardo's life_ 233

london Political Economy Club, which was founded in 1821 and
stayed in existence for 25 years The club's members were in the main
practical people, merchants and industrialists, political figures; only a
few were academic scholars At its monthly meetings they discussed
the most important questions of the day, the debates usually revolving
around questions of monetary circulation and the duties on corn—
questions that were uppermost in Ricardo's mind Up to the day of his
death, which came unexpectedly in 1823, Ricardo was the central
figure in the club's meetings, the majority of whose members ardently
defended—and did a great deal to implement—the ideas of free
_trade_

Ricardo successfully championed the ideas of economic liberalism—x

not only in his pamphlets and books, at gatherings of friends, and ^t
meetings of the Political Economy Club, but also from the tribune of
Parliament Chosen as a member of Parliament in 1819, he delivered
speeches, despite his shyness and dislike for oratory, during the
debates on monetary circlation, parliamentary reform, etc , in which
he declared himself in favour of bourgeois-democratic reforms (exten­
sion of the suffrage, the secret ballot) His teaching on monetary
_circulation had enormous influence both on the parliamentary com­_
missions debating this issue and on subsequent English legislation

Ricardo's literary and parliamentary declarations in defence of
economic and political liberalism inevitably made him an object of
attack, primarily from the representatives of the landowning class.
They accused him of defending the narrow interests of the monied and
industrial bourgeoisie, and even, on occasion, of having a personal
interest in the passage of this or that measure With unshakeable
tranquility and dignity Ricardo repudiated these personal suspicions,
and even refused to acknowledge himself as defending the interests of
a single social class Indeed, Ricardo was subjectively correct to see
himself as a defender of 'true' economic principles and of the interests
of all the 'people'(which he counterposed in one of his works to the
interests of the aristocarcy and the monarchy), since what he invariably
championed was the need for the rapid development of the productive
forces, which in his epoch could occur only in the form of capitalist
economic development The high duties on coin, the poor laws, the
rule of the landowning oligarchy all retarded the growth of the
productive forces, and thus Ricardo consistently came out against
them On the other hand, it is true that he never imagined that the
growth of the productive forces might be possible in a form other than
a capitalist economy, and so he rejected Owen's communist schemes

(on this see the following chapter)

Ricardo's horizons never extended beyond capitalist economy Yet
if he ardently defended capitalism's interests it was because his'
researches, being infused with the utmost scientific honesty and
candour, led him to see it as the only form of economy that would
provide sufficient scope for a powerful growth of the productive forces
and the wealth of society as a whole In Marx's words, 'Ricardo's
conception is, on the whole, in the interests of the industrial
_bourgeoisie, only because and in so far as, their interests coincide withA_

that of production or the productive development of human labour
Where the bourgeoisie comes into conflict with this, he is just as
_ruthless towards it as he is at other times towards the proletariat and:_
the aristocracy [4]

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

##### The Philosophical and Methodological Bases of Ricardo's Theory

In the great historical contest between the landed aristocracy and the
industrial bourgeoisie Ricardo stood decisively on the side of the latter
It would be a great mistake, however, to accept Herd's statement that
'Ricardo's doctrine was dictated simply out of the money capitalist's
hatred for the landlord class '[1] In Ricardo's time the industrial
bourgeoisie still played a progressive historical role, and its ideologues
still felt themselves leaders of the entire 'people' in a struggle against
the aristocracy and monarchy [2]

Ricardo was an ardent champion of the bourgeois capitalist order
because he saw it as the best means for guaranteeing, 1) the greatest
_individual happiness, and 2) the maximum growth of the productive_
_forces_

Bourgeois economic science had already raised the demand for free
competition and individual economic initiative in the 18th century
Both the Physiocrats and Smith consecrated this demand by making
reference to the eternal, natural right of the individual By the
beginning of the 19th century the role of natural right as the
bourgeoisie's main spiritual weapon in its struggle for a new order had
played itself out The foundations of the capitalist order had already
been laid, and th.e.great?Htsjuccesses the more were the ideojogists^of

tion, the desperate state of the labouring masses during the time of
the industrial revolution, and the first portents of the budding
struggle between the bourgeoisie and working class left little room for
the illusions of yesteryear From the beginning of the 19th century
demands for equality and brotherhood alluding to the natural right of
the individual were mostly coming from the mouths of the first
defenders of the proletariat, the early Utopian socialists. Henceforth,

236 _Davtd Ricardo_

the antethesis previously made between bourgeois natural right and
feudal tradition became impossible and inadequate The ideologists of
the bourgeoisie were faced with a new and difficult problem: to justify
the bourgeois order atone and the same time against both feudal tradi­
tion and the demands for natural equality being raised by the socialists
Called upon to solve this problem was the new philosophical system of
_'utilitarianism' developed by Bentham, which gained great currency_
from the 1820's onwards. If the theory of natural right had served as
philosophical basis for the doctrines of the Physiocrats and Smith, •
Ricardo and his closest disciples were feivent adheients of utilitarianism •

Although utilitarianism denied the doctrine of natural right, on one
point it continued in the same direction: it gave definitive formulation
to the Weltanschauung of individualism. Foi the Physiocrats the
demand for individual freedom followed from the character of their
ideal social system (the 'natural order' of society); in this sense society
still had domination over the individual, in effect itself determining-
the degree of freedom that the latter was allowed In the writings of
Adam Smith the individual and society are equal entities, existing in­
complete harmony with one another: the 'invisible hand' of the
creator ensures that they are in complete accord [3] Finally, in the
utilitarian system, society is completely subordinate to, and dissolved:
into the individual. Society is nothing but a fictitious body, a mecham-. •
cal sum of the individuals who comprise it In Bentham's words, 'thej
interest of the community . is the sum of the interests of the
several members who compose it. It is vain to talk of the interest of the
community, without understanding what is the interest of the indi­
vidual '[4] The interest of individuals, it is said, ought to yield to
the public interest But what does that mean? Is not one individual as
much a part of the public as another? _Individual interests are the_
only real interests ' [5] What does this interest of the individual consist
of? The enjoyment of pleasures and security from pains, i e , to attain
for himself the greatest benefit The 'principle of utility' forms the
cornerstone of the entire utilitarian system (the name derives from the
Latin utrlis, or useful) To evaluate the utility of a given action we
must sum up all its beneficial effects, on the one side, and all its
harmful effects, on the other; we then deduct the sum of the pains
from the sum of the pleasures (or vice versa) to obtain a balance that is
either positive or negative [6] By using this 'moral arithmetical] we
know what actions will be capable of assuiing the 'greatest happiness'
for the individual.

By what means can we construct a bridge from the happiness of the


-----

_Philosophical and methodological bases_ 237

_individual'to the well-being of society} Since society is itself ft mechani­_
cal sum of constituent individuals it follows that social well-being is
nothing mote than the result of mechanically adding up these
individuals' happiness The well-being of society means 'the greatest
_happiness for the greatest number.' And since a sum increases only with_
increases in its components, social progress is possible only as a rise in
the welfare or happiness of the individual 'Everything that conforms to
the utility or interest of the community increases the total welfare of the
individuals who compose it.'[8] But how do we increase this general
sum of individual welfares? Very simply; care for this should be left to
the individuals themselves, since 'each is his own judge of what is useful
for him '[9] 'Here we have a general rule: grant people the greatest
possible freedom of action in all those circumstances where they can do
harm to noone but themselves, since they themselves are the best
judge of their own interests '[10] Thus the social ideal that Bentham,
as founder of the utilitarian school, constructs out of the principle of
utility is maximum freedom of the individual and limitation of the
_state's functions to the purely negative task of keeping its citizens from_
doing damage to one another This system of bourgeois individualism
is preferable to feudalism and the 'inconveniences of its useless
burden' because it guarantees the individual the greatest possible
freedom of action and hence also the opportunity to attain maximum
happiness It is preferable to socialism because the latter deprives the
individual of the opportunity to attain the greatest utility or happiness
through the agency of his own labour 'When security and equality are
in conflict, it will not do to hesitate a moment Equality must
yield The establishment of perfect equality is a chimera; all we can
do is to diminish inequality ' * While the thinkers of the 18th century
had been filled with a magnanimous enthusiasm for universal equality
and brotherhood, the voice of the sober bourgeois now declared
equality a chimera While in the 18th century the duty of r.he
bourgeois order had been to realize the sacrosanct rights of the
individual, it now faced a mote modest task: to guarantee to each
individual the freedom to select what was most profitable ('useful' or
affording the 'greatest happiness') from amongst those undertakings
left open to him by the social system as it was

Ricardo became a philosophical adherent of utilitarianism via James
. Mill, a man who on economic questions had been Ricardo's pupil.
Bentham had said, • T was the spiritual father of Mill, and Mill

was the spiritual father of Ricardo: so that Ricardo was my spiritual
giandson '[111 Like Bentham, Ricaido was firmly convinced that
'where there is free competition, the interests of the individual and
that of the community are never at variance " The interest of society
can reside nowhere but in the optimal realization of the interests of its
constituent members. That which 'is less profitable to individuals [is]

       - herefore also less profitable to the State ' Ricardo believes it impossible
for there to be employments 'which, while they are the most profitable
to the individual, are not the most profitable to the State' [12] 'The
pursuit of individual advantage is admirably connected with the
_universal good of the whole By stimulating industry, by rewarding_
ingenuity, and by using most efficaciously the peculiar powers
bestowed by nature, it [the pursuit of personal advantage—l.R ] distri­
butes labour most effectively and most economically: while, by increas­
ing the genera! mass of productions, it diffuses general benefit, and
binds together by one common tie of interest and intercourse, the
universal society of nations throughout the civilized world '[13] In
Ricardo's eyes, to give free reign to the principle of 'individualadvan­
_tage ' (or, what is the same thing, to Bentham's 'principle of utility') is;_
the best guarantee of increasing the 'general benefit', which consists of
augmenting 'the general mass of products', i.e , developing the
productive forces Conversely one need only remove or impede the
activity of the personal-interest principle for there to be an inevitable
deterioration of the productive forces, a reduction in general welfare,
and a decline in the total happiness of society's members It was on this
basis that Ricardo rejected Owen's projects to set up communist com­
munities 'Owen is himself a benevolent enthusiast, willing to make
great sacrifices for a favorite object', wrote Ricardo in one of his letters
' . Can any reasonable person believe, with Owen, that a society, such
as he projects, will flourish and produce more than has ever yet been
produced by an equal number of men, if they are to be stimulated to
exertion by a regard to community, instead of by a regard to their
private interest? Is not the experience of ages againsr him?'[l4]

The ideal society for Ricardo, therefore, is capitalism, where
_competition between individuals, each of whom is out to attain the_
greatest possible personal advantage, assures that there will be maxi­
mum growth of the productive forces In this sense Ricardo was heir to
the Physiocrats and Smith Unlike his predecessors, however, he had

before him a capitalist economy at a higher, stage of*development and
was therefore able to formulate more correctly and more fully its
characteristic economic laws The Physiocrats had lived in a France that
was still semi-feudal; Adam Smith had been part of the age of
manufactories. Ricardo, because he was witness to the rapid growth of
large-scale capitalist machine production, was better able to make note
of is fundamental technical and socio-economic features

Smith's theoretical horizons had been completely bounded by the
technology of the manufactory When he spoke about machinery he
in essence understod it as the specialized instruments employed by the
manufactory workers It was Smith's assertion that 'in agriculture
nature labours along with man', while in industry 'nature does
nothing; man does all' [15] Only the era of the manufactory, where
production was based on manual labour, could have spawned such a
naive conception of industry With the progress of machine produc­
tion and the advance of technology such a conception became clearly
outmoded 'Does nature nothing for man in manufactures? Are the
powers of wind and water, which move out machinery, and assist
navigation, nothing? Ihe pressure of the atmosphere and the elasticity
of steam, which enable us to work the most stupendous engines—are
they not the gifts of nature? to say nothing of the effects on matter of
heat in softening and melting metals, of the decomposition of the
atmosphete in the process of dyeing and fermentation There is not a
manufacture which can be mentioned, in which nature does not give
her assistance to man, and give it too, generously and gratui­
tously.'[16] While Smith explains industrial progress almost exclus­
ively by the development of the division of labour, Ricardo adduces
such factors as 'the improvements in machinery the better division
and distribution of labour and the increasing skill, both in science
and art, of the producers '[17]

Ricardo expected the introduction of machinery to make products
cheaper and to bring a rise in output True enough, he did not close
his eyes to the disastrous situation of the workers whom the machines
had ousted The defenders of capitalism argued that the introduction
of machinery was incapable of causing even the slightest deterioration
in the workers' condition since those displaced would immediately
find employment in other branches of production At first Ricardo,
too, ascribed to this 'theory of compensation', but later on he acknow­
ledged—with his great, and characteristic honesty and scientific can­
dour—'that the substitution of machinery for human labour, is often
very injurious to the interests of the class of labourers. '[18] This view


-----

240 _DavidRicardo_

notwithstanding, Ricardo temained a fetvent advocate of the introduc­
tion of machines as a necessary condition for the development of the
productive forces He rejected the petty-bourgeois utopianism of
Sismondi, who wanted to reverse the wheel of history and go back to the
patriarchal economy of independent petty producers (craftsmen and
peasants) that had existed prior ro large-scale machine production

This rejection of the Smithian counterposition of agriculture to
industry made it possible for Ricardo to overcome the residua of
_Physiocratic ideas in Smith. In starting out from the view that nature_
assists man in agriculture but hot in industry Smith was assuming that
agriculture (rather than industry) was where society could most
profitably invest its capital. This view was understandable in the
middle of the 18th century, when England was still feeding its
population with its own grain and agriculture played the dominant
role in the country's economy Although at the stait of the 19th
century it still held this honoured position, and Ricardo was still
unable to conceive of England's transformation into a onesidedly
industrial state, he nevertheless maintained a firm course in favour of
England's industrialization, even if this was to be at the expense of a
curtailment in agriculture Heated debates on this issue flared up
between Malthus and Ricardo once the war with France had ended
The defenders of the landowning class, including Malthus, were
demanding high import duties on corn so as to keep corn prices from
falling and agriculture (which had been intensively developed during
the war years under the impact of high grain prices) from being cut
back Malthus labelled as 'extravagant' schemes to turn England into
an industrial state feeding on imported corn. Ricardo foresaw that it
would be necessary to import cheap foreign corn and that English
_capital would have to flow out of agriculture and into industry The_
prospect that 'the corn of Poland, and the raw cotton of Carolina, will
be exchanged for the wares of Birmingham, and the muslins of
Glasgow'[19] not only failed to frighten him—he hailed it He saw
the 'unusual quantity of capital drawn to agriculture'[20] as an
abnormal phenomenon that had been created by the war and which
was leading, as a result of its high costs of production, to excessively
expensive corn. Ricardo welcomed the import of cheap foreign corn
and a reduction in the capital invested in English agriculture: cheaper
corn would lead, he thought, to a rise in profits and a tremendous
flowering of the country's industrial life.

Thus, in Ricardo's constructs we have a country at a much higher
stage of technical development than that described by Smith, one

_Philosophical and methodological bases_ 241

that is rapidly proceeding towards industrialization by going through a
feverish period of introducing machinery. Ricardo advances our
understanding of capitalism's social characteristics noticeably less than
Smith; yet, for all that, these acquire much sharper outlines with
Ricardo than with the earlier economist, for whom a 'capitalist' point
of view is still able to coexist with a 'handicraft' one: in his
descriptions we often encounter, besides the capitalist economy, an
economy of petty producers; the figures of the capitalist and farmer at
times alternate with those of the craftsman and peasant. In Ricardo
the social background to capitalist economy is far more homogeneous:
to judge from his constructs of society we could well think that
England's handicraftsmen, cottage labourers, and peasants had
already completely disappeared by the beginning of the 19th century
(when in fact they still existed, and in healthy numbers). The entire
stage is occupied by capitalists (including farmers), wage -labourers,
and landlords (capitalist landlords, that is,, renting their land to
farmers) This is a 'pure' or 'abstract' capitalism, freed from the
admixtures and debris of pre-capitalist forms of economy Ricardo
presupposes that the tendencies inherent in a capitalist economy act
with full force, encountering no delays along their way. If Smith is
prepared to describe in great detail the innumerable obstacles that
interfere with the equalization of the rate of profit and wages in
different branches of production, Ricardo cites them merely in
passing

Ricardo conceives of capitalist economy as an enormous mechanism
whose error-free functioning is ensured by the capitalists' desire for
maximum profit; this desire results in the equalization of the rate of
profit in all branches of production (differences in the rate of profit
being maintained only so far as it is necessary to balance out the
advantages held by some branches of production over others). The
_striving to obtain the greatest profit is the basic, motive force of_
capitalist economy, and the law of equalization of the rate of profit is
its basic law. By grasping the central role of this1 law Ricardo once again

proves himself superior to Smith. It is true that Smith had already
presented a magnificent picture depicting how labour and capital pour
from some branches of production into others consequent upon
deviations in the market prices of commodities from their 'natural
prices' (values). Yet it was still not clear to Smith that the capitalist
entrepreneur plays the central role in this process of redistributing the
productive forces Smith still thought that the entrepreneur was joined
in his function of prime mover in this process by the wage-labourers


-----

.242 _David Ricardo_

and landowners Ricardo correctly identified the capitalist entre
_prewar as the prime mover in this redistribution of the productive_
forces between branches. 'This restless desire on the part of all the
employers of stock, to quit a less profitable for a more advantageous
business, has a strong tendency to equalize the rate of profits of
all '[21] The flow of capital out of less profitable branches and into
those that are more lucrative (in consequence of the greater credit
granted to the latter by the banks and the expansion of their
production) rectifies imbalances in the supply and demand of com­
modities The movement of the entire capitalist economy is subor­
dinated to the law of an equal rate of profit, this 'principle which
apportions capital to each trade in the precise amount that it is
required '[22]

Ricardo has thus 'purified' the capitalist economy from its pre-
capitalist admixtures and alloted the central role in this 'pure'
capitalism to the capitalist Ricardo studies each tendency within
capitalist economy in its pure' or 'isolated' form, on the presupposi­
tion that the force of its action will be undiluted by counteracting
tendencies This is Ricardo's 'abstract' method which provoked such
censure from his opponents (especialy from economists of the
historical school) Often Ricardo's 'abstract' or 'deductive' method is
counterposed to the 'experimental' or 'inductive' method of Smith,
which is deemed more correct The contrast is itself false. Wherever
Smith is seeking to discover the laws or tendencies of economic
phenomena he, too, utilized the method of isolation and abstract
analysis, without which any theoretical study of complex social
phenomena would be impossible With Smith, however, the train of
his theoretical analysis is broken (and at times distorted) by a
superfluity of descriptive and historical material. In Ricardo the sturdy
skeleton of theoretical analysis is freed of the living flesh of concrete
material culled from real life. An iron chain of syllogisms rapidly and
inexorably carries the reader forward, supported only by hypothetical
examples (usually beginning with the words, 'let us suppose that .. ')

[23] and arithmetical calculations Instead of Smith's vivid and
captivating descriptions, the reader can look forward to an abstact, dry
exposition, the difficulty of which is made all the greater by the fact
that he cannot for a minute let slip from view the multitude of
premises that the author either explicitly or tacitly assumes Ricardo's
method of abstract analysis is precisely what gives his theoretical
thinking its consistency and intrepidity and endows him with the
power to trace the workings of each tendency of economic phenomena


-----

_Philosophical and methodological bases_ 243

through to its very end This method allowed Ricardo to overcome
Smith's innumerable contradictions and to construct a logically more
integral and cohesive theory of value and distribution.

If Ricardo is to be reproached it is not for having applied an abstract
method, but for having forgot that the theoretical positions arrived at
by using it are contingent Above all Ricardo, as with the other
representatives of the Classical school, lost sight of the one basic
historical condition for the correctness of all theoretical economic
propositions: the existence of a determinate social form _ofeconomy_
(i.e , capitalism) That tfuTsociaf formTof economy should appear to
Ricardo as given and intelligible in its own right is a feature that he
shared in common with all the ideologists of the young bourgeoisie,
who in place of the old feudal system had posited a new social order that
they saw as natural, rational, and eternal 'The real laws of political
economy do not change', wrote Ricardo It is therefore understandable
that even this thinker who, by differentiating value from riches and
who, with his doctrines of labour value and rent did so much to
transform political economy into a social science, readily sought the
ultimate explanation for socio-economic phenomena in the action of
'immutable' natural laws (the biological law of population and the
physico-chemical law of the declining fertility of the soil).

Besides ignoring the basic socio-historical precondition to his
investigation, Ricardo often forgot, or lost sight of those partial
premises that formed the basis of his theoretical propositions. He
forgot that every economic tendency only fully manifests itself in the
_absence of counteracting tendencies, or as we say, 'all other conditions_
being equal' By underestimating the multitude of tendencies that
intermingle with one another in real life, Ricardo was inclined to
explain real phenomena, created by many different factors, in terms of
the activity of a single abstract law. One such abstract Ricardian law,
for example, states that when farmers begin to cultivate inferior lands
this will raise the value of a unit of corn (providing technique and other
conditions remain the same). The author then hastens to apply this
law to actual situations, declaring that the real rise in the price of corn
is explained by the fact that farmers are now cultivating inferior land
Ricardo takes another such abstract law—that a general rise in wages
necessarily lowers the rate of profit (all other things being equal) and
rashly (and erroneously) uses it to explain the historical fact of the fall
in the rate of profit This tendency to attribute unconditional validity
to conditional conclusions and to detect the immediate activity of
_'pure' laws in concrete, historical phenomena led Ricardo into a_

number of errors. These mistakes did not, however, prevent him from
grasping (precisely through using the method of abstraction) the basic
tendencies whose continuous, though at times concealed operation he
at the very bam of capitalist economy It is for this reason that Ricardo's
theoretical constructs, once altered and corrected, retain their validity
even today, and we are justified in acknowledging his work as one of
the great moriuments of human thought

CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

##### The Theory of Value

###### 1„ Laboui Value

Smith, as we know, had left behind a number of unresolved problems1'

and contradictions (see chapter Twenty-two above). Let us briefly
recall the most important:

1) Smith's theory suffered from a methodological dualism in the
very way that he posed the problem: he confused the measure of value.:
with the causes of quantitative changes in value.

2) Because of this he confused the labour expended on the.
production of a given product with the labour that that product will,
_purchase in the course of exchange_

3) Smith's attention focused sometimes upon the objective quantity
of labour expended and at others upon the subjective assessment of
the efforts and exertions that go into it.

4) Smith confused the labour embodied'in a particular commodity
with living labour as a commodity, i.e, with labour power.

5) Smith came to deny that the law of labour value operates m-a
_capitalist economy (in which labour nevertheless retains its function as;_
a measure of value)

6) Together with a correct point of view, which sees the value of a
product as the primary magnitude which then resolves itself into.,
separate revenues (wages, profit, and rent), Smith sometimes mistak­
enly derives value from revenue.

It is fair to say that on each of these questions Ricardo adopted the
correct standpoint and did away with Smith's contradictions It must
be added, however, that he worked through only the first three of
these problems to a successful completion As for the rest, although his.
stance was formally correct and he appeared on the surface to have -
eliminated Smith's inconsistencies, he was unable to genuinely resolve
Smith's underlying difficulties and contradictions

Above all, Ricardo decisively rejected any and all attempts to find,
an invariable measure of value, returning time and again to show that-
such a rneasurxj^c^ _method that Ricardo_
consistently applledto the theory of value is that of the scientific study,
_of causality, which the Classical school did so much to establish as._


-----

_The theory of value_ 249

part of political economy Ricardo was looking for the causes of
_quantitative changes in the value of products, and wished to formulate_
the laws of those changes. His ultimate aim was 'to determine the laws^
whrch regulate the distribution' of products between the different!
social classes [1] To do this, however, he first had to study the laws y
governing changes in the value of these products
^ By posing the problem unambiguously in terms of scientific
causality, Ricardo frees himself from the contradictions that befell
Smith when he was defining the concept of labour Ricardo starts out
his work with a critique of the way Smith confused 'labour expended'
with 'labour purchased', a question that he returns to in other
chapters. Ricardo consistently bases his entire investigation upon the
concept of the X^omexp ended on a commodity's production, and sees
changes m^The quantity of this, labour as the constant: juid most
jHp^ftahtu:easonibr-quaatita.tive fluctuations, imvalue. [21

In this sense Ricardo makes the monistic principle of labour value
the foundation of his theory (he makes certain exceptions to this,
which we will discuss below in Section 3 of this chapter) like Smith,
Ricardo at the very outset excludes utility, or use value from the field of
his enquiry, allocating to it a role as a condition of a product's
exchange value It is true that he talks here of 'two sources' of
exchange value: the scarcity of articles and the quantity of labour
expended on their production; this has led some scholars to speak of a
dualism in his theory as well This view is mistaken, since scarcity
determines the value (or more accurately," the jpfice)^ only of individual

_^^^J^2t^^^.^^J2^9P^^lczt^0^_ however, is studying the

process of production and the laws governing the value of products^
that are reproduced—and their value is determined by the quantity of
_expended labour What is more, Ricardo shows the genuine maturity \_
of his thought when he limits his investigation to 'such commodities j
only as can be increased in quantity by the exertion of human
industry, and on the production of which competition operates
without restraint ' [3] 'This in fact means that the full development of
the law of value presupposes a society in which large-scale industrial
production and free competition obtain, in other words, modern
bourgeois society ' * In Chapter IV of his book Ricardo reveals this
same clear understanding that the essential premise of the law of
labour value is the existence of free competition between producers

**'Marx, A Contribution** **_to the Critique of Politial Economy (Progress Publishers edition_**
**london: Lawrence & Wishart 1970 p 60],**

250 _David Ricardo_

'There he shows that any deviation between market prices and 'natural'

[price' (value) is eliminated by capital flowing out of certain branches of
industry into others * If Ricardo is to be faulted, it is not for having
made free competition (and hence the possibility of the reproduction
of products) his starting point, but, to the contrary, for having grasped-
with insufficient clatity the social and histotical conditions of the
emergence of free competition and for having assumed these to be
present even in the primitive world of hunters and fishermen

Thus the value of products subject to reproduction is determined by
the quantity of labour expended on their production On analysis, this
formula raises a number of questions: 1) when examining expended
labour, do we do so from its objective or its subjective aspect; 2) do we
take only the laboui directly expended on a product's manufacture, or
do we include the labour previously expended on manufacturing the
_means of production used in its production; 3) do we consider only the_
_relative, or the absolute quantity of expended labour; 4) is the value of_
a commodity determined £>y the quantity of labour actually expended
on its manufacture, or by the quantity of labour that is socially
_necessary?_

As to the first of these questions, it should be noted that Ricardo
rigourously adopts the objective point of view, doing away once and
for all with the question of the individual's subjective assessment of
the efforts that go into his labours (here again showing his superiority
over Smith) * *In receiving the products of labour the capitalist market
shows scant regard for the personal vicissitudes of the producers who
stand behind them These impersonal, inexorable laws of market
competition find reflection in Ricardo's system, which is so pervasively
objective as to verge on detachment

To the second of these questions Ricardo dedicated a special section
—Section III of chapter I. Its heading maintains that 'not only the
labour applied immediately to commodities affect their value, but the
labour also which is bestowed on the implements, tools, and build­
ings, with which such labour is assisted '[4] Implements, tools, and
machinery transfer their value (either wholly or, where they depreciate
only slowly, in part) to the product in whose manufacture they assist,
but in no way do they create any new value At the beginning of the
19th century, economists such as Say and Lauderdale, who were
enraptured with the high productivity of machines, attributed the

**"Here he even identifies the mechanism (expansion or contraction of the credit accorded**
**a given branch) by which this expansion or contraction of production takes place**

*** "See the third of Smith s contradictions enumerated at the start of this chapter**

ability to create new value, the source of capitalist profits, to the
machines themselves Ricardo understood perfectly well- that machines
and the forces of nature which they set in motion, though they may
raise the technical efficiency of labour and thereby augment the
quantity of me values that this labour can manufacture per unit of
time, nevertheless create no exchange value. Machines will only
transfer their own value to the product 'but these natural agents,
though they add greatly to value in me, never add exchangeable value,
of;which M Say is speaking, to a commodity: as soon as by the aid of
machinery, or by the knowledge of natural philosophy, you oblige
natural agents to do the work which was before done by man, the
exchangeable value of such work falls accordingly ' [5] By making a
sharp distinction between 'riches' (use value) and 'value' Ricardo
revealed the absurdity of the theory that nature creates value—a
theory developed with greatest consistency by the Physiocrats and
carried over by Smith in his theory of the exceptional productivity of
agricultural labour

On the third question, the view is often expressed that Ricardo,
because he was concerned only with the relative value of different
commodities and with the relative quantities of laboui expended on
their production, ignored the problem of 'absolute' value Indeed,
Ricardo does study the problem of value primarily from its quantitative
aspect and is looking to find the causes of quantitative changes in the
value of products. If the relative value of two products A and B is
expressed by the proportion 5:1, Ricardo accepts this fact as given and
spares it no further consideration A phenomenon holds his attention
when he can see in it indications of change; for example, when the
above-mentioned proportion of exchange gives way to a new one of
6:1 This does not, however, mean that Ricardo confines himself
simply to obseivable alterations in the relative values of two commod­
ities or in the lelative amounts of laboui required for theii production.
If the relative value of two commodities changes, he asks himself
whether this is because the 'real' ('actual', 'positive') value of
commodity A has risen, or because the 'real' value of commodity B has
fallen? A change in a commodity's 'real' value is for Ricardo the result
of changes in the quantity of labour needed to produce it. 'Labour is a
common measure, by which their real as well as their relative value
may be estimated '[6] Ricardo is here affirming that his theory is not
to be restricted simply to the study of the relative value of
commodities.

The last question relates to the attributes of value-forming labour


-----

252 _David Ricardo_

Marx accorded this question a great deal of attention, characterizing'.'
this labour as social, abstract, simple, and socially necessary Rrcardo,
given his over-riding concern for the quantitative side of value,
devoted his attention to those aspects of labour which influence the
magnitude of value Thus we find Ricardo commenting upon both
_skilled and socially necessary labour._

Ricardo, following Smith, acknowledges that one hour of skilled
labour, e g , that of a watch-maker, can create twice the value of one
hour's labour by a spinner This inequality is to be explained by 'the
ingenuity, skill, or time necessary for the acquirement of one species of
manual dexterity more than another ' The fact that this is so does not,
in Ricardo's view, invalidate the law of labour value Ricardo assumes^
that once the scale between these two types of labour (here taken at
2:1) becomes fixed it will show almost no variation over time. Once:
this is so the only change that can occur in the relative value of the two
given products is that produced by changes in the relative quantities of
_labour necessary to their production_

Similarly we find in Ricardo a concept—albeit not fully developed-—,
of socially necessary labour Value is determined by the labour
_necessary foi production In his theory of rent Ricardo derives his_
famous law that the value of products is regulated not by the labour
expended by the given individual producer, but 'by the greater
quantity of labour necessarily bestowed on their production' by-
producers working under the most unfavourable circumstances [7]-'
Where Ricardo went wrong was to have derived this law from<
differences in the natural conditions of agricultural production and
then advanced it as a general law applicable to ail situations and to all
products, be they from agriculture or industry Marx rectifed Ricardo's'
error here with his own theory of average socially necessary labour

Ricardo contrasted his own labour theory of value to others which
attempted to explain the magnitude of a product's value by the extent
of its utility or by the relationship between supply and demand He*
was scathingly critical of Say's theory of utility: 'When I give 2,000
times more cloth for a pound of gold than I give for a pound of iron,
does it prove that I attach 2,000 times more utility to gold than I do to
iron? certainly not; it proves only as admitted by M Say, that the cost •
of production of gold is 2,000 times greater than the cost of
production of iron If the cost of production of the two metals were the
same, I should give the same price for them; but if utility were the
measure of value, it is probable I should give more for the iron '[8]

Ricardo rejected the vapid theory of supply and demand no less


-----

_The theory of value_ 253

decisively: 'It is the cost of production which must ultimately regulate
the price of commodities, and not ; as has been often said, the
proportion between the supply and demand: the proportion between
supply and demand may, indeed, for a time, affect the market value
of a commodity, until it is supplied in greater or less abundance,
according as the demand may have increased or diminished; but this
effect will be only of temporary duration Diminish the cost of
production of hats, and their price will ultimately fall to their new
natural price, although the demand should be doubled, trebled, or
quadrupled ' [9]

To judge from these quotations one might hink that Ricardo
subscribed to a theory of production costs This is not so The vulgar
theory of production costs holds that a rise in wages will automatically
call forth a rise in the product's value. Ricardo expressed his dissent
from this view in the very first words of his book: 'The value of a
commodity depends on the relative quantity of labour which is
necessary for its production, and not on the greater or less compensa-
uon which is paid for that labour.' [10] Although there were occasions
when Ricardo failed to properly differentiate between costs of produ-
tion and outlays of labour, his entire system is geared towards
establishing the law of labour value and surmounting the theory of
production costs which Smith, owing to his own inconsistencies, had
fallen prey to (see sections 2 and 3 of this chapter)

Thus we can see that Ricardo contributed greatly towards improving
the theory of value He freed the idea of labour value from the wealth
of contadictions that we find in Smith Ricardo fundamentally
reformed the quantitative side of the theory of value He discarded the
search for a constant measure of value—that deceptive mirage that
economic thinkers had been pursuing from Petty to Smith—and
presented a doctrine on how quantitative changes in the value. of
products are causally dependent on changes in the quantity of labour
_expended on their production. Ricardo sees the development of the_
_productivity of labour as the ultimate cause behind changes in the_
value of commodities: but more than that, he is also looking in this
direction to find the key to the riddle of how the different branches of
production (agriculture and industry) and the different social classes
(landlords, capitalists and workers) inter-relate with one another
Ricardo explained the progressive cheapening of industrial manufac­
tures and the progressive rise in price of agricultural produce—both
characteristic phenomena of early 19th century England— in terms of
the workings of one and the same law of labour value The value

254 _David Ricardo_

of industrial wares falls as a result oi technical progress—the mtroduc- •
tion of machinery and rising productivity of labour The rise in value '
of agricultural produce is accounted for by the greater outlays of :

labour needed for its production, occasioned in turn by the increasing *
cultivation of inferior land This downward trend in the value of :

industrial products and upward movement in the value of agricultural;

produce will provide the key to understanding the tendencies behind *
the distribution of the nation's revenue between clams The rise in
corn prices, which results from poor land being brought under'
cultivation, brings in its train a sizable increase in ground rent, and
hence also a simultaneous need to raise money wages (real wages
remaining unchanged, however) This rise in wages inevitably
provokes a fall in the rate of profit In this fashion Ricardo dervies his
entire theory of distribution from the law of labour value

While Ricardo's analysis of value's quantitative side represented an
enormous advance over that of Smith, the qualitative or social
dimensions of value remained outside his field of vision. Here we find
the achilles heel of a theory whose horizons fail to extend beyond those
of capitalist economy Ricardo takes phenomena that belong to a
specific form of economy and ascribes them to any economy. The
_social forms that things acquire inside the context of determinate_
production relations between people are taken by Ricardo as properties
_of things in themselves. He does not doubt that each and every_
product of labour possesses 'value' never occurs to him thjyj/ajuejs
a specific social form, which the product of labouFacquires only when
sdcialiabotiris organized in a definite social form Changes in the
magnitude of value of products are conditional upon changes in the;
quantity of labour necessary for their production This is Ricardo's:
basic law His attention is riveted to the quantitative side of phen­
omena, upon the 'magnitude of value' and the 'quantity of labour'
He evinces no concern for the qualitative or social 'foim of value',
which is nothing but the material expression of social and production -
_relations between people as independent commodity producers. Nor_
does Ricardo show any interest in the qualitative or social form in
which labour is organized: he provides us with no explanation as to :
whether he is talking about labour as a technical factor of production.
_{concrete labour), or about social labour organized as an aggregation_
of independent, private economic units connected to each other
through the generalized exchange of the products of their labour
(abstract labour) Certainly, we find in Ricardo the embryonic shoots
of a theory of skilled and socially necessary labour, but it was left to .

Marx to develop the theory of both socially abstract labour and the
social 'form of value' * Ricardo's great reform of the theory of value
affected only its quantitative aspect To him the existing social (i e ,
capitalist) form of economic phenomena was given in advance, was
already known and therefore required no analysis. As to the qualita­
_tive side of value, only a thinker who had taken as his object of enquiry_
the social form of economy (i e , production relations between
people), the social form of labour, and the social 'form of value' could
reform that aspect of the theory Such a thinker was Marx

The failure of Ricardo to recognize that the social form of an
economy is historically conditioned did him little harm so long as he
restricted his investigation to those phenomena that corresponded to
the existing production relations between people (for example, to the
law of labour value of commodities, which is premised upon produc­
tion relations between people as commodity producers) But as soon as
Ricardo passed onto the exchange of capital for labour power (an
exchange predicated upon production relations between people as
capitalists and wage labourers) or to the exchange of products produced
by capitals of different organic compositions (an exchange which
presupposes production relations between capitalists in different
branches of production), his lack of a sociological method led him into
the most basic analytical errors, as we shall see below

###### 2., Capital and Surplus Value

Ricardo's inability to grasp the social nature of value as an expression
of the production relations between people created enormous difficul­
ties for him even in his theory of labour value; when it came to his
theory of capital and surplus value the difficulties only increased
Nevertheless, Ricardo did improve upon the existing theory of surplus
value, ridding the quantitative analyisis of these phenomena of a
number of the mistakes that had been present in Smith's account

Smith's theory of value came to ruin, as we know, when it moved
from petty commodity production to capitalist production The very
fact that a commodity (as capital) could exchange for a greater

**This disregard for the form of value led Ricardo. as it did the other representatives of**
**the Classical school, to misapprehend the social function of money** **Ricardo subscribed**
**to a quantity'** **theory of money and, apart from his doctrine on the movement of**
**precious metals between countries, added nothing new in principle to what Hume had**
**already formulated (sec Chapter Eight on Hume above)**

quantity of labour (labour power) than was embodied in it appeared to
Smith as a violation of the law of labour value (see Chapter Twenty-Two
above) Smith's only recourse was to declare that the law of labour value"
ceased to operate with the appearance of capital (profit) and the private
ownership of land (rent)

Ricardo directed his entire efforts to showing that the law of labour
value could operate even where there is profit and rent But surely the ;

working of this law is nullified by the fact that the value of a product
(corn) is sufficient to cover not simply the remuneration of labour
(wages) and the capitalist' s profit, but also to yield an additional margin •
_(rent) originating, as it would appear, not in labour but in the forces of_
nature? Not at all replies Ricardo in his theory of rent The value of corn'
is determined by the quantity of labour needed to produce it on land of
the most inferior quality The value of corn produced on such land
divides up only into wages and profit. The better lands receive a
differential rent, comprised not of a mark up on top of the value of the
commodity, but only of the difference between the labour value of the
corn produced on better land and its social labour value as determined
by the conditions of production on lands of the poorest quality, Rent is
not a component part of price By taking this position Ricardo
simplified the entire problem of the relationship between value and
revenues (we will have mote to say about this in Chapter Twenty-Nine),
such that it merely remained to explain the relationship between wages
and profit

Let us continue: the value of the product is sufficient not only to
remunerate the labour expended on its production but also to yield a
_profit over and above this—surely this must invalidate the law of value_
as well? Surely the fact that the value of the product breaks down into
wages and profit must conflict with a law which states that the product's
value is determined only by the quantity of labour expended on its
production? To resolve this problem in full one would have to discover
the laws behind the exchange of capital for living labour (labour
power), an exchange premised on production relations between
capitalists and wage labourers But Ricardo's thinking was, as we know, •
a long way from investigating the pioduction relations between people
The social attributes of capital, on the one hand, and of labour power
(wage labour), on the other, are simply missing For Ricardo capital and
_labour confront one another as different material elements of produc­_
tion. Ricardo defines capital in matenal-tecbnicaltetms, as 'that part of
the wealth of a country which is employed in production, and consists of
food, clothing, tools, raw mateiials, machinery, &c necessary

_The theory of value_ 257

to give effect to labour _Capital, then, is means of production, or_
_' accumulated labour,' so that even the primitive hunter possesses some_
capital Ricardo turns the confrontation between capital and labour
_power from a conflict between social classes into a material-technical_
, counter-position of 'accumulated' labour to 'immediate' labour
Hence capital has a dualfunction in Ricardo's arguments. On the one
hand, the emergence of capital (in the sense of means of production)
does not in the least invalidate the law of labour value: the value of the
means of production (machinery, and the like) is simply transferred'to
the product that they help to manufacture On the other hand, the
value of products contains not simply the previously existing 'accumu­
lated' value of the machinery and other means of production, which is
reproduced on the same scale as before, but an additional margin of
determinate size in the form of profit Where does this profit, or surplus
_value come from? Ricardo piovldes no clear answer to this question_

To reveal the laws which govern the exchange of embodied labour (as
capital) for living labour (as labour power) we must understand that, in
addition to the production relations that exist between people as

salmon, and that the means of production that each of them uses (the
bow and arrow of the hunter, the boat and implements of the '
fisherman) are products of identical amounts of labour In this case
one deer will exchange for two salmon, completely independently of • •
whether or not the hunter and the fisherman are independent;
producers or capitalist entrepreneurs conducting their business with
the help of hired labour In the latter case the product will be divided
up between capitalist and workers, 'but it [the proportion of the pro-'
duct going to wages—Tram ] could not in the least affect the relative
value of fish and game, as wages would be high or low at the same time ;

in both occupations. If the hunter urged the plea of his paying a large -
proportion, or the value of a large proportion of his game for wages, as
an inducement to the fisherman to give him more fish in exchange for •
his game, the latter would state that he was equally affected by the same
cause; and therefore under all variations of wages and profits the ;(

natural rate of exchange would be one deer for two salmon. '[11] In .
other words, no matter by what principle capital is exchanged for
labour, the exchange of one commodity for another commodity still'
takes place on the basis of the law of labour value: the proportions rn
which commodities mutually exchange for one anothei are determined;'

exclusively by the relative quantities of labour required for their •
production

We can now see the error in Smith's view, where in a capitalist
economy revenues (wages and profit) appear as the basic sources of
value, the primary magnitudes which, when altered, entail changes in '>
the value of the commodity. 'No alteration in the wages of labour could
produce any alteration in the relative value of these commodities; for
suppose them to rise, no greater quantity of laboui would be required in ^
any of these occupations but it would be paid for at a higher price, and
the same reasons which should make the huntei and fisherman
endeavour to raise the value of their game and fish, would cause the
owner of the mine to raise the value of his gold This inducement acting
with the same force on all these three occupations, and the relative .
situation of those engaged in them being the same befoie and after the •
rise of wages, the relative value of game, fish, and gold, would continue w
unaltered '[12] From here we get Ricardo's famous rule: a me in wages,
contrary to the view of Smith, does not cause the value of the product, to
_go up, but rather causes profits to fall A fall in wages makes profits rise. -_
The value of the pioduct can rise or fall only in consequence of changes •
in the amount of labour demanded for its production, and not because:
wages have gone up or down


-----

_The theory of value_ 259

This proposition, which tuns like a red thread through the whole of
Ricardo's work, is of cardinal importance. In the first place, by adopting
it Ricardo took a correct position on the question of the relationship
between value andrevenue, an issue over which Smith had observed his
own helplessness and inconsistency Smith had incorrectly maintained
that the value of a product is composed of the sum of wages, profit, and
jjfrent (and hence that the size of these revenues determines the amount
|of a commodity's value) This was completely alien to Ricardo's view
His standpoint is that the size of a product's value—-as determined by
the quantity of labour expended on its production—is the primary,
! basic magnitude that then breaks down into wages and profit (rent for
1 IRicardo is not a component part of price) It is obvious that once the
jsntire magnitude (the value of the product) is given in advance as a
fixed entity (being dependent on the quantity of labour needed to
produce it), any increase in one of its parts (i e , wages) will invariably
lead to a fall in the other (i e., profit)

Secondly, the proposition under discussion is testimony that Ricardo
saw profit as that part of the value of the product—created by the labour
_of the worker—which remains after deducting wages, and therefore_
moves inversely to the latter Ricardo's position here definitively
disproves any and all attempts to interpret his doctrine as a theory of
production costs If Ricardo' s view had been that value is determined in
conformity with production costs, i e., by what is actually paid to labour
in the form of wages, changes in the latter would elicit a corresponding
change in the product's value However, this is the very view that
Ricardo is so fbrthrightly rebelling against His assertion that wages and
profits change inversely to each other is comprehensible only under one
condition: if profit has its source in the surplus value created by the
worker'slabour We are compelled, therefore, to acknowledge that the
_idea of surplus value (as viewed in its quantitative aspect) lies at the very_
basis of Ricardo's system, and that he applied it with greater consistency
than did Smith The fact that Ricardo concentrated his attention mainly
on the exchange of commodities for other commodities and refrained
from directly analyzing the exchange of capital for labour in no way
refutes this statement; nor does the fact that Ricardo's specific men-
. tionings of surplus value ate less frequent than we find in Smith,
who often makes reference to the 'deductions' made from the work-
; er's product on behalf of the capitalist and the landlord. For
Ricardo the existence of profit—and even an equal rate of profit—is
presupposed in the very first pages of his study, providing, so to speak, a
permanent background to the picture he is'going to paint Although

Ricardo does not inquire directly into the origins of profit, the general
direction of his thinking leads him to the concept of surplus value The

up"into two parts: wages an3^ot7t'T)rthese, wages ate fitmly fixed,
being determined by the value of the worker's customary means of
subsistence (see below, Chapter Thirty)—that is, by the quantity of
labour needed to produce corn on land of the poorest quality What is
left after wages (i e., the value of the worker's means of subsistence)
have been deducted from the product's value constitutes **_profit_**
Like Smith, Ricardo analyzed profit and rent as^separate entities,
rather than bringing them together under the general category of
surplus value. He confused surplus value with piofk, mistakenly
extending to it the laws applicable to surplus value \
Ricardo ignores the social nature of profit, riveting\his entire
attention on its quantitative aspect. The state of the productivity of
laboui m agriculture, the value of the worker's means **_of_** **_subsistence,_**
the size of wages, and, depending upon fluctuations in the latter, the
**_size of profits, are the causal connections and quantitative1_** **_relationships_**

that Ricardo studies Ricardo makes the size of profit/depend exclu-.
sively on the magnitude of wages and hence, in the/last instance, on
changes in the productivity **_of labour within agriculture This is far too_** :

unilinear and narrow Insofar as we are dealing with the mass of profits,
this depends not simply on the size of wages, but on many social factors
as well (the length of the working day, the intensity of labour, the num­
ber of workers) Insofar as we are dealing with the rate of profit, this
depends to a very large degree upon the size of the total capital on which
the profit is being calculated Ricardo's disregard for these various
factors is a weak point in his theory of profit; yet at the same time it;
graphically reveals one of its valuable strengths: Ricardo's overriding
interest in the growth of the productivity **_of labour as the factor which_**
ultimately determines changes **_in the value_** **_of products_** **_and_** **_the._**
**_revenues of the different social classes_**

3- Prices of Production

Up to this point Ricardo has been more or less successful in avoiding
the reefs on which Smith's theory of value ran aground Tiue, he did
not really resolve the problem of the exchange of capital for labour;
which had been so theoretically troublesome for Smith But by pushing

it to one side he neutralized, as it were, its inhetent dangers and was
able to show that the distribution of the product's value between
capitalist and worker in no way affects the relative values of the products
being exchanged Of course, this argument conceals its own pitfalls It
assumes, for example, that a rise in wages (and a corresponding fall in
profits) affects each of the two commodities being exchanged to the
_same degree This assumption, however, is justified only under one_
condition: that the producers of trie two commodities either advance
their entire capital on the purchase of labour power (i e , on the hire of
workers) or divide it up between constant and variable capital in exactly
_the same proportions (Ricardo talks about fixed and circulating capital,_
but this has no effect on the problem) If each of them expends £ 1,000
on constant capital (machinery, raw materials, etc ) and £1,000 on
hiring workers, then a rise in wages (say, by 20%) will have the same
effect on both our entrepreneurs and have no influence on the relative
values of their commodities It is a different matter if, while one entre­
preneur divides up his capital in the proportions we have stated here,
the other lays out his entire capital of £2,000 purely and simply on
hiring workers Obviously a 20% rise in wages is going to be felt more
sensibly by the second entrepreneur; and his rate of profit will fall below
that earned by entrepreneur number one In order to equalize the rate
of profit in the two branchesof production the relative value of the pro­
ducts in the second branch must rise in comparison to the value of the
products of the first so as to compensate it for the greater loss suffered
from the increase in wages. [ 13] We arrive, then at an exception to the
rule that a change in wages does not affect the relative value of the pro­
ducts that are being exchanged: should exchange take place between
branc^. of production of capital,

anylncrease in wages will be accompanied by a me in the relative value"

change in the rate oiprofit) This is the famous 'exception' to the law of

laboui value that Ricardo examines in Sections IV and V of the first
chaptei of his Principles The heading to Section IV reads. 'The
principle that the quantity of labour bestowed on the production of
commodities regulates their relative value, considerably modified by
the employment of machinery and other fixed and durable capitals ' *
The law of labour value retains full validity only when the products
being exchanged are produced by capitals that have equal organic
_compositions, are of the same longevity, and are advanced for equal_
_periods of time [14]_

Ricardo illustrates his idea with the following example. Farmer A
hires 100 workers, each of whom he pays a wage of £50 a year His toTsd^
circulating (variable) capital is £5,000 pounds We assume that he
makes no outlays on fixed capital Given an average rate of profit of 10 %
the farmer's corn will at year's end have a value of £5,500 At the same
time cloth manufacturer B also hues 100 woikers, investing in his
business a circulating capital of £5,000 However, to manufacture the
cloth these workers use machinery with a value of £5,500 pounds
This means that B is investing in his business a total capital of £10,500
If, foi the sake of simplification, we assume that the machinery does not
depreciate, the cloth that has been manufactured in the course of the
year will have a value of £6,050: £5,000 as replacement for circulating
capital, plus £500 ( = 10% of this circulation capital), plus £550 (=
10% of the fixed capital) Although both the corn and the cloth have
been produced with equal quantities of labour (100 men), * * the cloth is
worth more than the corn: into the price of the cloth there enters an
additional sum of 550 pounds, which is profit on the fixed capital
Where does this additional profit come from if no more labour has been
expended on producing the cloth than on the corn? Ricaido does not ask
this question He states and then accepts as given the fact that the ratio .
of the corn's value to the cloth's is 5500:6050

**"Ricardo always speaks of fixed and circulating capitals, but by the latter he essentially**
**means capital advanced for the hire of workers (i.e, variable capital, in Marx s**
**terminology) [This quotation is from the Principles (Sraffa edition) p 30 —Ed}**
**' 'Since we have assumed that the machinery used in cloth manufacturing docs not**
**depreciate it does not transfer any of its value to the cloth [Rubin might more propetly**
**have said here that it does not transfer any of its value to the value of the cloth**
**Although Marx and virtually every Marxist economist since have talked of value being**
**transferred or imparted directly to the commodity one does not want to lose sight of the .**
**fact that value is a social, and not a material property of the product For a truly**

_The theoryJof value_ 263

Fiom here Ricardo goes orftb examine what effect a change in wages
will exert on the value of these two commodities Assume that wages
rise, thus causing the average level of profits to fall from 10% to 9%
The value of the corn will not change, but will remain at its old figure
of £5,500: whatever the fall in.the farmer's profits, his total wage bill
will increase by the same amount, so that the sum of wages plus pofit
will still be equal to £5,500 Similarly, the sum of cloth maker B's
circulating capital (i.e., his workers' wages) plus the profit derived
from it is unchanged to £5,500 What does alter is the additional
profitonhis£5,500of fixed capital Previously he had added on 10%
(£550), thus making his cloth worth £5,500 + £550, i e , £6,050
Now he charges only 9% (£495), so that the price of the cloth becomes
£5,500 + £495, i e , £5,995 The ratio of the value of the corn to the
value of the cloth, which before had stood at 5,500:6,050, stands now
at 5,500:5,995 Consequently, a rise in wages (or, what is the same
thing, afallm profits) lowers the relative value of those commodities
being produced using fixed capital (or using a larger amount of fixed
capital). The reason for this is that the price of these commodities
contains an additional amount of profit charged on the fixed capital
which declines with the fall in the rate of profit

The example we have anlayzed poses the investigator not only with
the problem of how changes in wages affect the value of different
commodities, but also with the much more profound and basic
problem of how to reconcile the law of labour value with the law of the
_equalization of the rate of profit on capital We saw that prior to there_
being any change in wages—and completely independent of this
change— the value of corn stood to the value of cloth in the ratio of
5,550:6,050, even though equal quantities of labour had been
expended on their production Here before us we have two com­
modities, produced with equal quantities of labour (100 workers), but
where the capitals advanced are unequal (£5,500 compared with
£10,500) From the point of view of the theory of labour value the
labour value possessed by the two commodities is equal From the
point of view of the law of an equal rate of profit, the price of the
latter commodity must be higher, since it contains a profit on a larger
_capital How do we resolve this contradiction? It was to answer this_
question that Marx constructed his theory of prices of production'

produced in society is divided up between all of its capitals in
proportion to the size of each If some commodities are sold at prices
above their labour value, others are sold at prices below it A branch of
production with a high capital structure receives the avetage profit,

      - hich exceeds the total surplus value that this branch has produced
These 'additional' sums of profit are taken, however, out of the
general reserve of surplus value created by all of the branches of
production together.

Ricardo was not only unable to resolve the problem of 'prices of
production" he could not even pose it in all its scope True, he
understood that with two branches of production having different
organic structures of capital the prices of their products must deviate
from their labour values to allow their rates of profit to be equalised
Ricardo started out grasping a firm hold of the idea that the
governing tendency within capitalist economy was for for profits to be
_equalized He had no doubt that cloth must cost more than corn,_
despite their equal labour values, so that its owner could earn a profit
on his larger capital investment The cloth manufacturer's right to
receive a ptofit corresponding to the size of his capital appeared to
Ricardo so natural that the question of where this additional £550
profit (on fixed capital) originated from did not concern him By
assuming an average rate of piofit from the very outset, i e., that
commodities sell not at their labour values but at their prices of
production, he avoids the basic problem of how the average rate of
_profit is formed and how labour value is uansformed into prices of_
_production Rather, his attention is focused specifically on the effect_
that changes in wages have on the relative prices of commodities
produced by capitals with unequal organic compositions, indepen-.
dently of alterations in labour value Ricardo, in establishing that
changes in wages and profit do influence the relative values of
commodities, acknowledges that here we have a 'modification' or
_'exception' to the law of labour value He consoles himself that this_
'exception' is of no great significance: the effect that changes in wages
(and profit) exert on the relative values of commodities is insignificant
compared to the impact of changes in the quantity of labour necessary
for their production. By analyzing the quantitative changes that take
place in the value of commodities the growth in the pioductivity of
labour preserves its former role as the predominant factor On this
basis Ricardo considers himself justified in pushing aside his exception
and considering 'all the great variations which take place in the
relative value of commodities to be produced by the greater or less.

_The theory of value_ 265

quantity of labour which may be required from time to time to
produce them '[151 Exceptions notwithstanding, the law of laboui
value retains its validity in his eyes, and he subsequently constructs his
entire theory of distribution upon it

Although Ricardo continues to hold fast to the law of labour value,
the exceptions to it in fact punch a gaping hole in his formulation of
the theory of value. To the question, where does the profit on fixed
_capital come from?, Ricardo gives no answer Instead of demonstrating_
that the product of one branch of production will sell as much above
its labour value as the product of another branch sells below its own,
Ricardo makes anothei, totally unintelligible assumption; corn sells at
its full value (5,500), but cloth sells above its value (£5,500 + £550).
Instead of demonstrating the process by which the average rate of
profit is formed, Ricardo takes the rate of profit to be 10% in advance,
without any explanation The source of the profit on circulating
(variable) capital is xht labour value of i5,500 created by the labour of
100 men; it therefore falls with every increase in wages (and vice versa):
the sum of wages (circulating capital) plus the profit on circulating
capital is assumed to remain steady at £5,500 The profit on fixed
capital is mechanically added to the labour value created by the
workeis' labour at the defined rate of 10% (that is, a profit of
unknown origin equal to £550, or 10% of the fixed capital, is
added to the £5,500 value that the 100 workers have cieated)
This mechanical adding togethei of the profit on fixed capital and the
profit on circulating (variable) capital illustrates clearly the way in
which Ricardo had mechanically combined the law oflabour value and
_the law of an equal rate ofprofit on capital Ricardo did not abandon_
the first, but he was unable to make it accord with the second Smith's
theory of value came to ruin over the problem of exchanging capital
_for labour; Ricardo's theory, on the other hand, was unable to resolve_
the problem of how prices of production and an equal rate of profit we
formed Ricardo himself acknowledged that his exceptions had intro­
duced a contradiction into the theory of value He says in his
correspondence that the relative value of commodities is regulated not
by one, but by two factors: 1) the relative quantity of labour necessary
for their production, and 2) the size of the profit on capital up to the
time when a product of labour can be put on the market (or, what is
the same thing, the relative periods of time required in bringing a
product to market). [16] Here profit on capital (or the time over which
capital is advanced) functions as an independent factor which regu­
lates—along with labour—the value of commodities

**266** _David Ricardo_

This contradiction in Ricardo's doctrine served as a starting point for
subsequent scientific developments. Ricardo's followers Games Mill
and McCuIloch) did their best to maintain that unstable equilibrium
between the theory of labour value and the theory of production costs
(or between the law of labour value and the law of an equal rate of
profit) which was to be found in Ricardo. Freedom from these
contradictions could be had either at the price of abandoning the
labour theory of value or by fundamentally reworking it Malthus, a
severe critic of Ricardo, called for the first of these when he argued that
the many 'exceptions' allowed for by Ricardo sapped the law of labour
value of any definitive validity The second line was pursued by Marx,
whose theory of 'prices of production' resolved those contradictions
which, though latent and confused, had made themselves felt m
Sections IV and V of the first chapter of Ricardo's book, and which
were to become the subject of lively debates in post-Ricardian
literature (see Chapter Thirty-Three below)

**relationship between society's aggregate surplus value and its aggregate capital**
**The total capital (assuming that capitals A and B are the only two capitals**
**in society) here equals 200; the total surplus value equals 50** **Ihe rate of'**
**profit p'** **therefore equals 25%** **Each of these capitals will sell at a price of**
**production determined by its costs of production.'** **i e** **total capital, plus the**
**profit on that capital** **which is the average rate of profit for society, as a**
**_whole_** **or 25% Ihus capital A will have a price of production foi its product of**
**80c + 20v + 25p => 125**
**and capital B a price of production on its product of:**

**70c + 30v + 25p •= 125**
**Now the two capitals have equal selling prices and equal rates of profit; their**
**selling prices are the same only because these are capitals of equal gross size**
**earning the average rate of profit What has happened is that the total surplus**
**value of society as a whole has been apportioned** **_according to the size of the total_**
**_capital_** **_of_** **_each_** **_of_** **_its_** **_constituent_** **_capitals,_** **this** **means** **that** **capital** **A**
**sells above its value and capital B below its value However, total surplus value**
**remains the same; it is merely redistributed** **so as to equalize** **rates of**
**profit Also total price equals total value (250 in both cases)**

**rise in wages for capital A will raise them to 1200; if this comes out of profits (since**

**A 1000c + 1200v + 400p = 2600**
**Similarly** **a 20%** **rise fot capital B will** **raise them** **to 2400;** **reducing**
**profit by the same amount, capital B will be:**

**B** **0c + 2400v + 200p = 2600**
**Ihey still have equal prices** **but now they have unequal rates of profit;**
**capital A's rate of profit equals 400/2200 = 18%; capital B s rate of profit**
**equals 200/2400 = 8 3%** **To equalize its rate of profit with that of capital A**
**capital B would have to raise its price (by raising its total profit) from 200 to 432**

**It is important to recognize why this has happened A 20% rise in wages has**

**the existence of an average rate of profit once their capitals were unequal in size**

**In other words, the very assumption of an equal rate of profit in this example**

CHAPTER XWENIY-NINE

##### Ground Rent

Ricardo's theory of differential rent has suffered far fewer alterations
during the ensuing development of economic thought than have all
his other theories At present it is generally accepted by nearly all
economists of the most diverse tendencies Marx was to incorporate its
basic features into his own theory of rent,

The second chapter of Ricardo's book, devoted to rent, is, by virtue
of its simplicity and the clarity of its basic ideas, one of the most
brilliant examples of the application of the method of abstraction in
the history of economic literature. From a few initial propositions and
the application or implication of a number of simplifying conditions,
Ricardo derives his entire theory of rent* which abuts directly upon his
theory of value, developed by him in Chapter I of his book He asks, at
the very outset, whether the fact that the price of agricultural produce
(in the broad sense) includes rent does not contradict the theory of
value?

Prior to Ricardo, queries as to the origin of rent had received the
following answers The Physiocrats (see Chapter Fourteen) had said
that rent originates in the superior productivity of agricultural labour
which, in collaboration with the forces of nature, yields a 'net product'
over and above the produce consumed by the workers themselves: rent
is created hy nature. In Smith (See Chapter Twenty-Three), as usual,
we find several embryonic solutions to the problem In the first he
partially takes over the physiocratic idea that rent results from the
special productiveness of agricultural, as compared to industrial
labour; secondly, in his idea that profit and rent are both 'deductions'
from the value created by the worker's labour, he reduces rent to
labour; finally, there is his idea that the value of the product is defined
as the sum of wages, profit, and rent, by virtue of which he opened the
way for those theories that attribute the higher value of agricultural

*** Ihe forerunner to Ricardo s theory of differential rent was a writer from the end of the**
**ISthcentury Anderson The law of'diminishing fertility of the soil was formulated in**
**1815, practically simultaneously by West, Malthus, and Ricardo [On Anderson—and**

produce to the need to pay rent to the proprietor of the land If taken
to its logical conclusion this last idea turns into a theory that explains
rent by the landowner's 'monopoly' status which results in the sale of"
agricultural poducts at prices which exceed their value by the amount
of the rent

Thus, from the point of view of the Phynocrat.1, rent is an in natura
surplus of products over and above those consumed by the workers
According to the 'monopoly' theory, rent is an increment added onto
the price of the agricultural product, which is then sold above it3
value The first solution teats the theory of rent from the theory, of
value, the second sees rent as an exception to the principle of labour,
value

Ricardo's theory was directed against both these viewpoints As an
objection to the Physiocrats he points put that the exceptional
productivity of agricultural labour—assuming that it actually exists—-
is accompanied by a rise_in_tfie_ number of use values or in natura

Hence we have Ricardo's first thesis: tent comes not from the special
productivity of agriculture, but on the contrary, results from the'
_deterioration of the conditions under which labour is applied, or the*_
_transfer of production from superior land to land of poorer quality_
The value of corn is determined by the quantity of labour expended to
produce it on the worst land * Rent is the difference between the value
of this corn (its 'socially necessary' or 'market value', to use Marx's^
terminology) and the 'individual value' of a given bushel of corn
produced on land of prime quality This rent is called, therefore,
_'differential rent'; and arises where" exp^ditures""''of TaTxxur*'*_

have different productivities, either by virtue of being made on pieces
of land of unequal fertility (rent oi fertility) or at different distances
from a common market'(rent of distance)" or by having been
successively applied to one and the same plot of land (rent of
_intensity)._

Ihe theory that rent is the margin between the individual value and
the socially necessary value of products** links the theory of rent
immediately and inseparably to the theory of value, making the
phenomena of rent akin to other economic phenomena, especially to
'differential profit', or 'superprofit' The latter accrues to those
capitalist entrepreneurs who carry out production using new
improvements, particularly new methods of production, etc The
difference between superprofit and rent is as follows: 1) superprofit is
a temporary phenomenon, which disappears as soon as the
improvement in question becomes universally applied and thus lowers
the product's socially necessary value, whereas differential rent,
because it depends on permanent differences in the fertility or location
of plots of land or in the productivity of successive expenditures of
labour, is constant; f 2) superprofit is earned by the capitalist, whereas
rent goes to the landlord. Let us consider this point further

Why is it that the superprofit which the farmer receives from
employing more advanced machinery stays in his pocket, while the
superprofit accruing from the greater fertility of the land he is
cultivating has to be paid over to the landlord and turned into rent>
Should a portion of this rent remain with the farmer he would be
receiving a superprofit (i.e., a profit greater than the average rate of
profit) solely by virtue of the fact that he is producing on a plot of land
that is more fertile In this case all other farmers would want to lease
this plot, upping what they would pay as rent until the entire
superprofit (the rent) was passing into the hands of the landowner and
the farmer was left with only an average rate of profit Thus, to explain
why the whole of the differential rent is transferred to the landlord,
Ricardo puts forward a second premise which states that there are

**• "Here it is a question of differences in expenditures not on production** **but in**
**transporting the produce to where it will be sold Ricardo mentions this form, of rent**
**only in passing. The doctrine of rent of distance was developed by Thiinen in his famous**
**book Die holierte Stoat (1827)**

**"Because there is no explanation in Ricardo of the social process by which individual**
**labour is transformed into socially necessary labour, he was unable to give his theory**
**precise formulation even though he had developed it in its essentials**
**f Even though this difference is constantly present its magnitude nonetheless fluctuates,**
**thus giving rise to changes in the volume of differential rent**

274 **_David Ricardo_**

_sufficient capitals in the country looking to invest in agriculture_
_wherever they can be assured of receiving the average rate of profit_

Rent, therefore, is received not because the price of corn exceeds its
value, but because the value of the particular corn in question is below
the socially necessary value With this explanation Ricardo resolutely
rejects the second of the theories that we earlier referred to, namely the
_'monopoly' theory, which sees rent as an increment added onto the_
value of the product 'The reason then, why raw produce rises in
comparative value, is because more labour is employed in the
production of the last portion obtained, and not because a rent is paid
to the landlord. The value of corn is regulated by the quantity of
labour bestowed on its production on that quality of land, or with that
portion of capital, which pays no rent Corn is not high because a rent
is paid, but a rent is paid because corn is high ' [2] Rent does not _enter^_
_into the product's value, which is determined by the amount of labour_
(or capital) expended on poor quality land. Land of this quality earns
the farmer only an average profit on capital, but will provide nothing
extra that could be payed over as rent to the landlord Yet how can the
farmer get hold of such a tract for cultivation without paying rent to a
landowner? Ricardo is obviously presuming the existence of poor
quality land freely accessible to anyone who wishes to work it In othec •
words, Ricardo is ignoring just those limitations that private property
in land—including very poor land—places in the way of capital -
investment in agriculture. Only in this way could Ricardo arrive at the
conclusion that inferior tracts of land yield no rent.

Ricardo's theory of rent gives us, then, the following three
propositions'. 1) there is no such thing.as absolute rent (i e , rent paid
for cultivating land of the poorest quality); 2) the only rent that exists
is differential rent, which equals the difference between individual
and socially necessary expenditures of labour (or capital) and arises
because farmers are gradually bringing land of increasingly inferior •
quality under cultivation; 3) the whole of the differential rent goes to v

the landowner Ricardo's first thesis, as we will see, is wrong and needs
correction His doctrine of differential rent is on the whole correct It is ;
still true that the theory of differential rent as Ricardo developed it
contains a number of non-essential elements that need to be
expunged Ricardo had tied his theory of rent to the mistaken idea
that, because farmers would be tilling land of poorer and poorer
quality, the quantity of labour needed to produce a bushel of corn
would go up and there would be an inevitable and progressive rise in
the price of corn Indeed, Ricardo does acknowledge that progress in


-----

_Ground rent_ _lib_

agricultural technology teduces the quantity of laboui required to
produce corn, but it is his opinion that these technical advances can
only momentarily retard or attenuate the operation of this so-called
_law of'diminishing fertility of the soil' and not abolish it_

^Ricardo's erroneous idea that technical progress in agriculture
tended in a direction opposite to that of industrial development was
simply a theoretical reflection of fortuitous economic phenomena that .
_temporarily appeared in England at the beginning of the 19th_
century English industry in Ricardo's time was marked by the rapid
introduction of machine production and the cheapening of
commodities In his theory of value Ricardo generalized this
phenomenon: he was convinced that 'alterations in the quantity of
labour necessary to produce commodities are of daily occurrence. Every ^
improvement in machinery, in tools, in buildings, in raising the raw
material, saves labour, and enables us to produce the commodity to
which the improvement is applied with more facility, and
consequently its value alters '[3] Industry develops in an atmosphere ^ ^
of non-stop technical progress, growth in the productivity of labour,
and cheapening of products Agriculture develops in a different
direction—and here again Ricardo is generalizing from the previously
described features of early- 19th-century English agriculture (the tillage
of new land of poorer quality, the rising costs of producing corn, and
an awesome rise in corn prices). These were the historically transient
conditions of English agriculture during the period 1770-1815, but
Ricardo in effect incorporated them in toto into his theoretical
conceptions .^cprdin^ develops under the

(although real wages will remain unchanged) The growth of mOney'-
wages and the rise (both teal and monetary) of rent create a tendency"
for the rate of profit to fall The lion's share of the benefits of
economic progress go to the landlords, to the detriment of the-
capitalists, and to a lesser extent of the workers as well. Thus, in terms'

depicts are these:ffirst7)acolossal rise in the price of corn and ground'

   - that Ricardo was historically inaccurate when he maintained that
farmers always begin by cultivating the best lands and only later shift
to poorer ones; let us allow that his certitude that the price of corn
must progressively rise was misplaced. Independent of these facts, that
is, no matter what the order in which we transfer from some tracts of
land to others and no matter what the price of corn is, even if it be a

Given that the capitalists (farmers) and landowners are separate
classes, this surplus quantum, or superprofit, goes to the latter and is
transformed into rent, that is, into the specific form of income of a
definite social class Thus, for all the corrections that have to be made
in Ricardo's theory of differential rent, it remains on the whole fully

CHAPTER THIRTY

##### Wages and Profit

Although Ricardo's doctrine on wages was to gain wide cuirency under
the title 'the iron law of wages' (given it by Lasalle), from a theoretical
standpoint it rs one of the weakest and least satisfactory parts of his
system

Worst of all, Ricardo—and this is in accord with his general
method—paid no regard to the qualitative or social side of wages
Under what socio-economic conditions do wages arise, what relation­
ships between social classes do they presume, on the basis of what laws
does the exchange of wages for labour power take place? Ricardo asks
none of these questions Because he fails to distinguish labour power
from labour, he is unable to explain how it is that 'labour' (i.e.,
labour power) possesses less value than the value that it creates To
explain this Ricardo would have had to differentiate the social
characteristics of labour as a commodity (i e , the labour of the wage
worker, or labour power) from the social characteristics of the labour
that creates the commodity (i e , the labour of the commodity
producer). Yet we have already noted Ricardo's disregard for the social
characteristics of labour and capital (see Chapter Twenty-Eight,
Section 2)

Ignoring the qualitative or social side of wages, Ricardo focuses his
entire attention on their quantitative dimension Ricardo's writings on
the magnitude of wages possess both significant merits and enormous
deficiencies Their greatest merit is that Ricardo persistendy strives to
define wages as a magnitude that is precisely fixed. Ricardo rejects the
superficial explanation of the level of wages in terms of the relationship
between the supply of, and demand for labour—an explanation that
we have already encountered in Smith and which was developed in the
1830's by the proponents of the 'wages fund' theory (see Chapter
Twenty-Three and the chapter below on the wages fund) In Ricardo's
view demand and supply influence only the 'marketprice of labour'
i.e , 'the price which is really paid for it, from the natural operation of
the proportion of the supply to the demand' 'However much the
market price of labour may deviate from its natural price, it has, like
commodities, a tendency to conform to it '[1] As with commodities,


-----

280 _DavidRicardo_

the market price of labour fluctuates around a stably determined
centre, which forms irs 'natural price' (or value)

By what is labour's' natural price' determined? 'Ihe natural price of -
labour', says Ricardo, 'is that price which is necessary to enable the
labourers, one with another, to subsist and to perpetuate their race,
without either increase or diminution ' 'The natural price of labour,
therefore, depends on the price of the food, necessaries, and conven­
iences required for the support of the labourer and his family. With a
rise in the price of food and necessaries, the natural price of labour will
rise; with the fall in their pike, the natural price of labour will fall '[2]
The natural price of labour (or the value of labour power, in Marx's
terminology) is determined by the value of the necessary means of
_subsistence of the worker and his family Lasalle was later to give this_
theory of 'minimum means of subsistence' the name 'the iron law of
_wages', which he used as an agitational device to demonstrate to the_
workers the impossibility of achieving any fundamental improvement
in their situation within the capitalist system.

Even though we can find embryonic versions of the 'iron law'
among economists of the 17th and 18th centuries, it was Ricardo who
gave it its classical formulation Among the mercantilists (see Chapter
Three) the iron law bore the character of a practical prescription; wages
_had to be limited to the necessary minimum of means of subsistence in_
older to cut the costs of production and expand the export of domestic
commodities The Physiocrats (see Chapter Thirteen), among whom
[lurgot is often deemed to.be the author of the iron law, made no clear](http://to.be)
distinction between the wages of the worker, on the one hand, and the
subsistence of the cialtsman, or even the piofit of the entrepreneur, on
the other: according to Physiocratic doctrine all these forms of revenue
were restricted to the necessary means of subsistence Ricardo's merit is
to have: 1) formulated the iron law as applying specifically to the
wages of wage labourers, 2) endeavoured to uncover—albeit unsuc­
cessfully, as we shall see—the mechanism which explains how this law
works, and 3) tied the theory of wages to the theory of profit For all its
failings, Ricardo's theory of wages has enormous advantages over the
theory of supply and demand, as formulated by Smith (where it
intermingles with the theory of means of subsistence), Malthus, and
proponents of the 'wages fund'.

As we know, we can find among economists two variants of the
_means of subsistence theory: one is the theory of a 'physiological:_
_minimum', the othei a theory of a 1 cultural minimum'_ Proponents of
the former say that workers' wages are confined to the sum total of

means of subsistence physiologically needed to sustain the worker and
his family Partisans of the second theory justifiably extend the
concept of a minimum of means of subsistence to include all those
means needed to maintain the worker at his customary standard of
living in conformity with the social and cultural conditions of a given
population during a particular historical period At first glance
Ricardo seems to be closer to the broader and more flexible formula­
tion of a cultural minimum He grasps that the 'natural price' of
labour 'varies at different times in the same country, and. very
materially differs in different countries! It essentially depends on the
habits and customs of the people' 13] Further on, however, he usually
forgets these qualifications and comes close, when substantiating the
iron law, to a physiological minimum theory

How does Ricardo substantiate his iron law? In other words, how
does he account for the fact that wages will gravitate towards a level
which corresponds to the value of the worker's necessary means of
subsistence? In Ricardo's view the mechanism which keeps the market

natural price of labour 'the condition of the labourer is flourishing and
. happy' and he is able 'to rear a healthy and numerous family When,
however, by the encouragement which high wages give to the increase
of population, the number of labourers is increased, wages again fall
to their natural price.'[4] They cannot fall below that level for very
long, for if they did the workers would be deprived of their essential
/ means of subsistence, 'privations [would] reduce their number', and'
wages would again go up The workers' rapid multiplication prevents
wages from rising for any length of time above the natural price of
labour; when they multiply slowly or die off this keeps wages from
falling for too long below it. If, because of ensuing deprivations, J
^ drop in wages below the natural price of labour causes the number of
workers to be reduced, it is obvious that the 'natural price' of labour
includes only that aggregate of means of subsistence as is uncondition­
ally needed to keep the worker and his family alive. Here Ricardo's
teaching comes close to the physiological minimum theory

^Ricardo thus substantiates his iron law of wages by having recourse
to the unvarying, biological law of human reproduction formulated by
Malthus Once the movement of wages is regulated by 'natural'
changes in the population, any and all attempts to raise wages by
artificial means, e g., through strikes or factory legislation, become
doomed to failure Ricaido did not undersrand that the workers, by

social needs—can bring about a tise in wages Nor did he grasp tfe
significance of factory legislation (which In his day was still non-exis-
tant) In accord with other ideologists of the bourgeoisie, he pro­
claimed that 'wages should be left to the fair and free competition of
the market, and should never be controlled by the interference of the
legislature '[5] The only possibility of a more or less long-term
improvement in the workers' condition that Ricardo admitted would
be if the law of population was unable to assert its influence This
could happen either because the workers, in seeking to preserve the
high level of subsistence that they had obtained, consciously abstained
from reproducing or because of new colonies^ with an abundance of
fertile land, where the rate of growth of capital outstrips the rate of
increase in population On the first point Ricardo was conceding to
Malthus, on the second to Smith Nevertheless, Ricardo nurtured no
great faith in the workers' conscious abstention, and considered a
rapid growth of capital to be but a temporary phenomenon. Thus,
these exceptions notwithstanding, Ricardo continued to hold to his
iron law and to take a pessimistic view towards the prospect of a
protracted rise in real wages^

Because his theory of wages suffers, as we have already noted, from
its approximation to the theory of a physiological minimum, it
acquires traits of unreality and ahistoricism These features of the iron
law are intensified still further by the false grounds on which Ricardo.
justified it Especially false is the idea that one can look to the speed or
slowness with which the workers reproduce themselves as a cause of
upward or downward movements in wages The appearance or
disappearance of a surplus working population depends, in capitalist
economy, not on the absolute increase 01 decline in the number of]
workers, but on the periodic expansion and contraction of capitalist]
pioduction. The reserve army of unemployed is a necessary appurtenV
ance of capitalist economy, which in no way stems from the fact that
the workers are reproducing themselves with exceptional rapidity In
periods of expansion capitalist industry recruits new hands from this
reserve army: to do so it does not have to wait the twenty years it would:
take, on Ricardo's assumption, for a rise in wages to encourage the
workers to multiply and bring forth genuinely 'new' labourers into the
world If we are to look for that mechanism which forces wages to
gravitate towards the level of customary means of subsistence it should

Ricardo's doctrine on the 'static' level of wages, then, despite the
healthy kernel that it conceals, was marred by the biological or
'natural' basis that he gave to it. His interesting doctrine on the
_"dynamics' of wage movements suffers from exactly the same defect ,_
Here Ricardo seeks the ultimate cause of phenomena in the workings
of natural laws: the 'physico-chemical' law of diminishing fertility of
_the soil, and the 'biological' law of population. We saw above, in our_
chapter on rent, that Ricardo, basing himself on a mistaken belief in
the permanence of the former law, considered it inevitable that the
prices of corn and other agricultural produce would progressively rise
Since the worker requires a determinate quantity of food stuffs to
sustain life, any rise in their price will invariably boost the 'natural
price' of labour, or money wages (even though real wages will remain
unaltered or even fall, as we shall see below) 'The same cause which
raises rent, namely, the increasing difficulty of providing an additional
quantity of food with the same proportional quantity of labour, will
also raise wages. '[6] 'But there is this essential difference between the
rise of rent and the rise of wages '[7] The landlord's rent will increase
both in terms of corn (because of the extension of cultivation to inferior
lands and the growing disparity between the fertility of superior versus
poor plots) and even more so in terms of money (as a consequence of
the rise in both value and price of each bushel of corn). 'The fate of
the labourer will be less happy; he will receive more money wages, it is
true, but his corn wages will be reduced '[8] To understand why it is
that, according to Ricardo, corn or real wages will decline it is necessary
to look at the tendencies behind movements in profits

We have already encounterd Ricardo's theory that profits always
move inversely to changes in wages, 'Profits would be high or low in
proportion as wages were low or high',[91 says Ricardo, confusing
here—as everywhere—the rate of profit with the rate of surplus value
(for the rate of profit can in fact fall even with a fall in wages,
providing that the total amount of advanced capital rises at the same
time). From here it follows that if money 'wages should rise with the
rise of corn profits would necessarily fall', [10] since with the labour
value of commodities remaining unchanged manufacturers will sell
them at their former price, despite wages having gone up _'The_
_natural tendency of profits then is to fall; for in the progress of society_
and wealth, the additional quantity of food required is obtained by
the sacrifice of more and more labour '[11] Although this tendency
will from time to time be arrested owing to advances in agricultural
technique and the free import of cheap foreign corn, it casts its gloomy

shadow over the entire future of the capitalist economy: it threatens tov

bring economic progress to a total halt and to reduce society to a state1

where 'the very low rate of profits will have arrested all accumulation;
and almost the whole produce of the country, after paying the
labourers, will be the property of the owners of land '[12]

Even though capitalist society had not yet reached this position, the
pace of its economic progress was progressively decelerating with the
fall in profit. 'The farmer and manufacturer can no more live without
profit than the labourer without wages Their motive for accumulation'
will diminish with every diminution of profit '[13] Thus the natural
lawof diminishing fertility of the soil results in a slow _aow^lnT^erate_
_of capitd^accimmfation.. By virtue of our natuf at Taw" rioweve?7TeV_
oie~Biological lavTof population, the workers will continue to increase-
their numbers at the same rate as before If the number of workers
rises at 2 % pet year while the rate of capital accumulation drops from
2 % to 1 %, the demand for labour power will obviously lag behind its
_supply, in other words, real wages will fall: Admittedly, 'instead . of_
the money wages of labour falling, they would rise; but they would not
rise sufficiently to enable the labourer to purchase as many comforts
and necessaries as he did before the rise in the price of those
commodities '[14] 'The condition of the labourer will generally
decline, and that of the landlord will always be improved '[15] These,
then, were the pessimistic conclusions that Ricardo's theoretical atgu-.
ments led him to and which seemed completely confirmed by the
desperate state of the workers at the start of the 19th century Because
of these dismal conclusions economists of the historical-ethical school
upbraided Ricardo for being indifferent to the fate of the working
class The rebuke was highly unjust: Ricardo, with supreme scientific
conscientiousness and theoretical intrepidity, was merely revealing
what appeared to him as the tendencies inevitably inherent rn
capitalist economy

Now, a hundred years after the appearance of Ricardo's work, it is
easy to prove that he was wrong in his assessment of these tendencies
The decreasing fertility of the soil, the rising price of corn, the growth
of money wages, a fall in profit, the decelerating tempo of capital
accumulation, a fall off in the demand for labour, and a decline in real
wages—such was the chain of cause and effect that Ricardo had
depicted. Many of the links in this logical chain proved weak The rise
in labour productivity and the enormous advances made in technology,
and agronomy showed his idea of an inevitable and progressive rise in.

too, rose as a result of rising social needs and the greater social might
of the working class; both factors that had been of little import in
Ricardo's day I'he growth in the productivity of labour outstripped
the rise in real wages, and as a result relative surplus value (which
Ricardo called profit) increased, rather than fell In spite of this the
_rate of profit fell because of the rising organic composition of_
capital—ie , precisely because labour productivity rose instead of
dropping In its details Ricardo's effort to explain how the revenues of
the different social classes moved proved to be incorrect Yet this in no
way obviates the immense value of the Rkardian theory of distribu­
tion, which marked an entire epoch in the history of our science

Ricardo was the first to have posed the problem of distribution in all
_its breadth and to have made it the focal point of his investigation ' T'o_
determine the laws which regulate this distribution, is the principal
problem in Political Economy', he writes in the Preface to his
_Principles In a letter to Malthus, Ricardo counterposes his own_
conception of political economy as the science concerned with the laws
of distribution of products between classes, to the conception of
Malthus, which sees political economy as the science of the nature and
causes of wealth While Smith's chapters on distribution remain a
collection of disparate facts and observations, Ricardo presents a
complete and theoretically reasoned picture of the interdependencies
and movements of incomes, which he has constructed upon a single
principle. This principle is the principle of labour value jn_Smith the

"Rlcafdo did In one letter express the view that a resolution of the grand
problems of political economy—rent, wages, and profit—were not
necessarily tied to the theory of value, he in facr based his entire
investigation on the principle of labour value, upon which he then
. built his theory of distribution.

Ricardo's second great merit is to have given primacy to the problem
of the relative shares of the different social classes in the value of the
product, rather than to the distribution between them of absolute
. shares in the in natura product (the predominant vantage point found
in Smith and in part carried over by Ricardo) Assume, says Ricardo,
that the worker receives one and a half times as much food, clothing,
and the like as previously If at the same time the productivity of
labour were to double (thus causing the value of products to be halved)
we would say that the share (or 'real value') of wages has fallen

286 _DavidRicardo_

Even though the worker now obtains a greater number oi products in
_natura, his relative share in the value of the social product has dec­_
lined Ricardo was the first to have introduced this method of posing the
problem into science, and it was subsequently developed by Rodbertus
and by Marx, the latter in his so-called 'theory of impoverishment'

By posing the problem of relative distribution, Ricardo was able to
clearly discern the contradictions of class interests in capitalist society:
In complete accord with the characteristic features of his epoch and with
his own social and class position, Ricardo laid special and persistent
stress on the conflict between the interests of the landowners and the
interests of the remaining classes in society: the fall in agricultural
productivity and the rising price of corn lower the rate of profit and
hold back the accumulation of capital, cause the position of the
workets to deteriorate, and at the same time make the landlords
exorbitantly rich However, along with this basic contradiction, which
dominated both the reality of early-19th-century England and his
theoretical conceptions, we can find in Ricardo's writings the outlines
of the great historical struggle that was beginning to take place
between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In Smith's schema a-rise
in wages does not the slightest harm to the capitalists' interests, since
it causes the price of the product to go up and is therefore paid for by
the consumer, In Ricardo's scheme a rise in wages is not accompanied
by a general rise in the product's price, but inevitably brings about a
fall in profit: we see reflected in this law the irreconcilable contradic­
tion of class interests between bourgeoisie and proletariat Admrttedly
the workers can receive a greater quantity of food, clothing, etc., and
thereby improve their lot at the same time as the capitalists grow rich.
The apologists for capitalism, Carey and Bastiat, pointed to just this
possibility of better conditions for the workers in their polemic against
Ricardo's doctrine (see the Chapter on Carey and Bastiat, below).:
What they ignored, however, was Ricardo's doctrine of relative
distribution: the working class cannot possibly raise its relative share in
the value of the social product unless there is a drop in the relative
share going to the capitalists: With Ricardo the Classical school.
